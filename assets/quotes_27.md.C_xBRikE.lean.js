It shows independent films and stage productions, and hosts musical concerts. Designed by Detroit-based architect Maurice Finkel and built in 1927, the historic auditorium seats 1610 and features the theater's original 1927 Barton Theatre Pipe Organ, orchestra pit, stage, and elaborate architectural details. It was built for and owned by Angelo Poulos and his heirs and was leased until 1978 to the Butterfield Theatres chain, who managed it along with Butterfield's nearby State Theater. Both theaters are now owned and managed by the non-profit Michigan Theater Foundation. History The Michigan Theater opened on January 5, 1928, and was at the time the finest theater in Ann Arbor. The theater not only showed movies, but also hosted vaudeville acts, live concerts, and touring stage plays. Over the years, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Paul Robeson, and Ethel Barrymore all appeared at the theater. During a renovation in 1956, many of the original ornate designs were destroyed. After a period of low attendance, the theater was threatened with demolition when its 50-year lease to Butterfield Theatres ran out in 1978, but members of the community and local organists helped raise funds to save and renovate the theater, returning it to its original design. A second screen, the Screening Room, with a state-of-the-art sound system, seating for 200, and the ability to project films digitally, was added in 1999. The Michigan Theater is the current home of the annual Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Ann Arbor Symphony, the Ann Arbor Concert Band, and Dandia Dhamaka. The theater has been named 2006 Outstanding Historic Theatre by the League of Historic American Theaters. The theater also hosts a series of children's stage productions entitled \\"Not Just For Kids\\" and a concert series entitled \\"The Legends of Rock & Roll.\\" Barton Organ The Barton Opus 245 theatre pipe organ was built for the Michigan Theater and installed in November, 1927, shortly before the theater was opened on January 5th, 1928. Of some 7,000 theatre organs collectively built by many companies between the mid-1910s and the early 1930s, the Michigan Barton is one of only about 45 remaining in their original locations. It has three manuals (keyboards) and thirteen separate ranks of pipes, while other area Barton organs of the time have or had ten ranks of pipes. The instrument also has various tuned and untuned percussions and a standard ‚Äútoy counter‚Äù of special effects to aid in film accompaniments. The Barton deluxe/‚Äúcircus wagon‚Äù-style console is situated on a functioning Barton four- poster lift. The nearly-forgotten Barton organ had fallen into disuse in the 1950s and suffered water damage in the early 1960s. It was repaired and began receiving regular use in the early 1970s, and factored significantly in raising strong community support to save the historic theatre when the original lease expired in 1978. In regular use since that time, the marginally-adequate original blower failed in early 2014 and was rebuilt with a larger custom motor and new impellers. The instrument was completely rebuilt and restored to like-new mechanical and tonal condition by Renaissance Pipe Organs of Ann Arbor between 2018 and 2020, with the console and relay having been updated to reliable solid-state in 2014. The instrument is professionally maintained, and is played regularly by staff organists prior to film screenings and for silent films, making it one of the most-heard theater organs in the country. Exterior The Michigan Theater Building is a large, two-story block building, consisting of the Michigan Theater itself and seven retail stores fronting the street, as well as offices above. The building's exterior is clad with brown brick with cement and terra cotta trim. The main section of the facade, three bays wide, contains the entrance to the theater and two flanking stores. This section is Lombard 'Romanesque in style. The remaining five storefronts are all to one side of the main section, and are considerably plainer. In the plainer section are two slightly recessed storefronts than flank the stair access to the second floor. In each section, the roofline parapet contains the name of the building. The Romanesque theater entrance contains cream terra cotta columns, arches, and other Romanesque elements on the second floor; these elements on the first floor were lost to the 1956 remodeling. Decorative aprons above the second-floor arcade sections contain green and blue terra cotta, and additional decoration is within the arches.  Interior  = Lobby = The inner lobby still retains original details, including a barrel-vaulted ceiling, Romanesque columns and arch decorations, wood paneling, and wrought-iron balcony and staircase railings. = Auditorium = The main auditorium, seating 1610, is used for film screenings and live events.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 17, 2002. It is the third trilogy episode of the series, which had become annual since the twelfth season's \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", consisting of three self-contained segments that are based on historical stories. The first segment puts Homer Simpson in the role of Odysseus in the ancient Greek epic poem the Odyssey. The second segment tells the story of Joan of Arc, and the third and final segment lampoons William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. The episode was written by Andrew Kreisberg, Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton, and Mike B. Anderson served as the director. Show runner and executive producer Al Jean stated that the episode was \\"very fun for the writers\\" to do because it \\"allow[ed] them to parody great works of literature.\\" On the other hand, Anderson stated that the episode was \\"much harder\\" to direct than others because, like with Treehouse of Horror episodes, the animators had to make as many character designs for one act as they would for one normal episode. In its original American broadcast, the episode was seen by more than 4% of the population between ages 18 and 49. Following its release on DVD and Blu-ray however, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Homer is told that he has an overdue book from the library, which he checked out when Bart was a baby. He says that he had intended to read to Bart every day, but various things had gotten in his way. Before he returns it, he reads from the book, telling three stories. =D'oh, Brother Where Art Thou?= In this story, Homer is Odysseus, and delivers the King of Troy (Ned Flanders) a Trojan horse. He and his crew, including Apu, Lenny, Moe, Professor Frink and Carl, kill all of Troy's citizens and win. However, he refuses to sacrifice a sheep, angering the gods, Zeus (Mayor Quimby), Dionysus (Barney), and Poseidon (Captain Horatio McCallister). Dionysus tries to destroy Odysseus with a lightning bolt, but misses and instead destroys the island of Atlantis. Poseidon literally blows Odysseus and his crew to the Sirens (Patty and Selma) and visit Circe (Lindsey Naegle), who turns his crew into pigs, whom Odysseus eats. Circe orders Odysseus to go through Hades, crossing the River Styx (which has the Styx song \\"Lady\\" playing during the crossing), in order to go home so he can see Penelope (Marge) and Telemachus (Bart). When he arrives back to Ithaca, he spears all of the suitors (Krusty the Klown, Kirk Van Houten, Groundskeeper Willie, Mr. Burns, and Sideshow Mel) trying to please Penelope. Penelope decides to take him back, though he leaves to go to Moe's (even though Moe is killed and eaten by Odysseus earlier in the episode). =Hot Child in the City= Lisa is Joan of Arc, who leads the French against the English in the Hundred Years' War, which Homer implies was also called \\"Operation Speedy Resolution\\". Despite her family's concern, she joins the army, where she has new ideas about defeating the enemy. She meets the King of France (Milhouse). During a battle, the English capture Joan and put her on trial. She is accused of witchcraft, and sentenced to death. When Lisa claims that she was following God's will, Groundskeeper Willie reveals that he too was chosen by God, but to lead the English armies against the French. God's voice then excuses himself by revealing that the two were never supposed to meet. As they read the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her. Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, claiming that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that it is easier to chew than the video of Bambi. =Do the Bard, Man= Bart is Prince Hamlet in this Simpsons version of William Shakespeare's classic. His uncle Claudius (Moe) marries Gertrude (Marge) after killing King Hamlet (Homer) by way of poison. The King returns to his son as a ghost, telling him of the betrayal and requesting that his death be avenged. Prince Hamlet (Bart), with the help of a professional actor (Krusty), puts on a play to make Claudius reveal himself to be guilty; however, Hamlet's reaction leads everyone to believe that he is crazy, so Ophelia (Lisa) decides to \\"out-crazy\\" him by prancing around and singing a stupid song, eventually jumping out the window and into the moat where she drowns. Because Hamlet knows what he did, Claudius attempts to kill him. Hamlet, aiming to kill Claudius, accidentally kills Polonius (Chief Wiggum). Polonius implores his son, Laertes (Ralph Wiggum), to avenge his death (\\"I like revenging!\\"). Set to duel Hamlet, Laertes accidentally kills himself taking his \\"practice stab\\", and Hamlet proceeds to murder Claudius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Carl and Lenny), meanwhile, have been covered in poison and kill each other with a high five. Hamlet walks away to celebrate, but he slips on some blood and dies. Seeing a big mess she does not want to clean up, Gertrude commits suicide by hitting herself in the head with a mace. Bart thinks Hamlet was boring despite every character being murdered, but Homer tells him that the story became a great film called Ghostbusters, and all the Simpsons dance to the theme. Production Mike B. Anderson directed the episode. \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\" was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by Andrew Kreisberg, Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton. It originally aired on March 17, 2002 on the Fox network. \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\" is the third trilogy episode produced for the series, the other two being \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" from season 10, and \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" from season 12. Al Jean, the show runner for the episode, stated that trilogy episodes are \\"very fun for the writers\\" to do because it allows them to parody \\"great works of literature\\" and condense them into one act each. Before writing the episode, the writers had decided that one of the segments would feature Lisa as the main character. According to Jean, the writers found it very difficult to find a historical story for Lisa because there are \\"so few [historical stories] that star women\\". They had the same problem when pitching stories for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in which they resorted to giving Lisa the role of \\"Connie Appleseed\\", a feminization of the historical figure Johnny Appleseed. The writers eventually settled on Saint Joan of Arc. According to the episode's supervising producer Don Payne, Scottish actor David Tennant watched \\"Do the Bard, Man\\" along with the cast of Hamlet during their first rehearsal.Payne, Don. (2010). Commentary for \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The segment has also been used in schools to teach students about Shakespeare's literary work. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Anderson stated that trilogy episodes, like the Treehouse of Horror episodes, are \\"much harder\\" to direct than normal ones because the animators have to make as many designs for each act as they would for one normal episode. In the scene in which Joan gets torched by the English, Jean specifically ordered Anderson to \\"make sure she doesn't get burned\\", even though she was surrounded by flames. Jean explained in the commentary that, when Mike Scully was show runner for The Simpsons, Jean learned that \\"people do not wanna see changes in [the characters'] basic design\\" when the character gets hurt. He added that, because the viewer is \\"so attached to the characters, [the viewers] don't wanna see... especially Lisa, get hurt in any way.\\" In order to make Homer's ghost in the third segment transparent, the animators had to \\"double expose\\" him; Homer's cels were first shot normally and then with a diminished opacity. In the first segment, clouds can be seen moving behind Zeus. The clouds were animated by airbrushing the cels and then moving them slowly in order to make it \\"look heavenly\\".Anderson, Mike B. (2010). Commentary for \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references \\"Do the Bard, Man\\" bases its story on William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. Each segment is based on and include references to historical stories; \\"D'oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\" takes its story from the ancient Greek epic poem the Odyssey, while taking its name from the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? (also based on the Odyssey), \\"Hot Child in the City\\" is based on the life and legend of Saint Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who, as a teenager, led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War. \\"Do the Bard, Man\\" spoofs William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, while the title takes its name from \\"Do the Bartman\\", a song performed by Bart early in the series. The song that the sirens are singing in the first segment is a parody on the 1978 disco song \\"Copacabana\\" by Barry Manilow.Long, Tim. (2010).

In order to return to Ithaca, Homer crosses the river Styx, in which the dead can be seen dancing \\"Lady\\" by the band Styx. In the second segment, the captain resembling Chief Wiggum is initially leading the French army. The soldier resembling Lou points out that the captain \\"keeps switching back from French and English.\\" The scene satirizes films like Doctor Zhivago in which the Russians speak with a British accent even though they are in Russia. At the end of the act, Marge can be seen eating the page which shows Joan's demise and, say \\"Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video.\\" The scene is a reference to a scene in the Disney film Bambi, in which Bambi's mother is shot to death by hunters.Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the beginning of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Release In its original American broadcast on March 17, 2002, \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\", along with a new episode of Malcolm in the Middle, received more than a full rating point more than ABC's showing of the film Snow White: The Fairest of Them All, which received a 3.1 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that the episode was watched by more than 4% of the American population of said demographic at the time of its broadcast. On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season on DVD and Blu-ray. Following the release of The Simpsons thirteenth season, \\"Tales from the Public Domain\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that The Simpsons trilogy episodes \\"tend to be pretty spotty.\\" Of the three stories, Jacobsson liked \\"Do the Bard, Man\\" the most, although he overall found the episode to be \\"mediocre\\". Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that, even though the episode \\"has a few laughs\\", it \\"just feels half-hearted\\", and, writing for 411Mania, Ron Martin described the episode as being \\"just a lazy way out for the writers\\". Giving the episode a negative review, Nate Boss of Project:Blu wrote that the episode is \\"awful\\" and \\"kinda annoying\\", and that it \\"has been done so many times, it's hardly all that funny\\". On the other hand, Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that he is \\"particularly fond of [the episode]\\" and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered it to be a \\"stand-out\\" episode in the season. The Vulture column of New York magazine named it one of the ten best episodes of the show's later era.

He is well known for having been a member of the band Evanescence, as well as a successful songwriter and producer. He has also been part of the bands Trading Yesterday, The Age of Information, Avox, and Arrows to Athens. Career =1999‚Äì2002: Evanescence= Hodges joined Evanescence in late 1999 and made their Origin demo CD and their debut album, Fallen, with bandmates Amy Lee and Ben Moody. The band's first single, \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" went to No. 1 on multiple charts, including the Billboard Top 40, and catapulted the band into an international spotlight. Fallen was certified platinum within weeks of its release in March 2003 and has gone on to sell over 16 million copies worldwide. In 2004, Hodges took home two Grammy awards with the band for Best Hard Rock Performance and Best New Artist. =2003‚Äì2007: Trading Yesterday and The Age of Information= After the Evanescence album Fallen was completed, Hodges left the band. Back in Little Rock, he started a band in 2003 called Trading Yesterday. The band, which consisted of Hodges (vocals, guitar and keyboard/piano), Colbert (drums) and Steven McMorran (bass), released a demo CD called The Beauty and the Tragedy on May 15, 2004. Within weeks, they signed a record deal with Epic Records and moved to Los Angeles, California to record their major label album. The album was finished during the first half of 2005 and the single \\"One Day\\" was released on the soundtrack to the movie Stealth. In 2006, Trading Yesterday parted ways with Epic Records and the album, tentatively titled More Than This, was shelved. After six years, More Than This was independently released in September 2011. In August 2007, after parting ways with Epic, Hodges and McMorran started a new band called The Age of Information with collaborators Josh Dunahoo and Will Hunt. The band evolved from the acoustic sound of Trading Yesterday to something more electronic. The EP Everything is Broken was released on September 11, 2007. =2004‚Äì2010: Initial songwriting success, Warner Bros solo project, Avox, and Arrows to Athens= While busy working on his own music, Hodges was also writing and producing songs for various artists. Hodges worked with artist Kelly Clarkson along with former Evanescence bandmate Ben Moody on songs from her album Breakaway (\\"Because of You\\" and \\"Addicted\\"). Clarkson's second album sold more than 12 million copies and Hodges' work was awarded the 2007 BMI Song of the Year. \\"Because of You\\" went on to be covered by Reba McEntire & Clarkson for McEntire's duets album Reba: Duets. Clarkson's version was a Billboard Top 40 No. 1, and Reba's duet version peaked at No. 2 on the Hot Country Songs, garnering Hodges BMI Pop and Country Awards respectively. In 2007 he worked with Celine Dion (\\"This Time\\") and the Backstreet Boys (\\"Something That I Already Know\\"). In July 2008, it was announced that Hodges had been signed by Warner Bros. Records as a solo artist. With Warner, The Rising (EP) was released digitally on August 11, 2009. In 2008, Hodges had a hit as writer and producer for American Idol season seven runner up David Archuleta for his song \\"Crush.\\" The song reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Hodges also wrote the single \\"What About Now\\" on Daughtry's debut album, which sold over 5 million copies to date. Hodges took home BMI pop awards for both \\"Crush\\" and \\"What About Now\\" in 2010. Hodges also co-wrote \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\" and \\"Supernatural\\" with Daughtry for their second album Leave this Town. That record went on to sell over a million copies. After Reba McEntire's \\"Because of You\\" duet, Hodges' next step into country music was with Carrie Underwood when he co-wrote \\"What Can I Say\\" with her for her third album Play On, which went to No. 1 on the Country Billboard Charts and sold over 2 million copies. Hodges also co-wrote gold certified pop hit \\"Wanted\\" for Jessie James, along with \\"Circadian,\\" \\"Hard To Believe,\\" and \\"Rapid Eye Movement\\" for David Cook's second record This Loud Morning. In fall of 2010, Hodges released a new project with longtime friend John Campbell entitled Avox. The album The Fragile World is a collection of symphonic and electronic instrumental tracks. In October 2011, Hodges released an album entitled Kings & Thieves with the band Arrows to Athens, composed of Hodges and guitarist Steven Solomon. Additionally in 2010, Hodges wrote with Carrie Underwood and Hillary Lindsey, this time for the end title song in the latest Chronicles of Narnia film. The song was called \\"There's a Place for Us,\\" and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best original song in a motion picture.https://www.deadline.com/2010/12/2011-golden-globe-nominations- announced =2011‚Äì2015: Continued songwriting success, Third and Verse= In May 2011, Christina Perri released her debut album Lovestrong. Hodges helped produce and co-wrote many songs on the album, including singles \\"Arms\\" and \\"Distance\\" featuring Jason Mraz. That summer, Hodges' song \\"Stitch by Stitch\\" was performed on the first season of The Voice by winner Javier Colon as his first single along with \\"As Long As We Got Love\\" featuring Natasha Bedingfield as Colon's second single. \\"Stitch by Stitch\\" immediately went to No. 1 on the iTunes pop charts. Also in 2011, Hodges and songwriting partner Steven Solomon wrote many songs together with Tristan Prettyman for her Capitol Record's album Cedar and Gold. He also wrote \\"The Woman I Love\\" with Jason Mraz which was released on his album Love is a Four Letter Word. By late 2011, Hodges was back in with Perri to write for the hit Twilight film Breaking Dawn. The song \\"A Thousand Years\\" went on to sell over 6 million copies worldwide and the soundtrack that was certified gold. Starting in March 2012, Hodges co-produced Avril Lavigne's self-titled album with friend and Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger. The album's first single \\"Here's to Never Growing Up\\" has sold over 2 million copies worldwide and is certified platinum in the US. In addition to \\"Here's to Never Growing Up\\", Hodges also helped write the album's other singles \\"Rock n Roll\\", \\"Let Me Go\\" featuring Chad Kroeger, and \\"Hello Kitty\\", which have all had success in various international markets. Additionally in 2012, Hodges began writing with Tonic frontman Emerson Hart for Hart's solo record Beauty in Disrepair. Hodges produced the album and co-wrote many songs including \\"The Best That I Can Give\\" and \\"Hurricane.\\" 2012 also marked the end of Hodges' seven-year publishing relationship with EMI as the company was bought by Sony/ATV. Later that year, Hodges signed with Kobalt Music Group and started his own publishing joint-venture with them called Third and Verse. The first writer signed to Third and Verse was writer/producer Steven Solomon. Third and Verse has gone on to sign Gabe Dixon, Cameron Walker, Jake Scott, David Ryan Harris, and others. The company's success ranges from placements in films and commercials to cuts in multiple genres including pop, country, and rock. In August 2013, Hodges's single with Carrie Underwood entitled \\"See You Again\\" went to No. 1 at country radio. The song was certified platinum and is part of her multi-platinum album Blown Away. He also wrote Colbie Caillat's \\"When The Darkness Comes\\" for Sony Screen Gem's film The Mortal Instruments.

Argentine Pass is located on the crest of the Front Range along the boundary southwest of Georgetown and is the highest named vehicle-accessible pass in the state. Some early references use other names for the pass. An 1867 description of the trip from Georgetown into the valley of the Snake River refers to it as Sanderson Pass.Over the Plains to Colorado, Harpers New Monthly Magazine, Vol XXXV, No. CCV (June 1867); pages 1-21, pages 13-15 discuss the trip over Sanderson Pass, which must be what is now known as Argentine Pass. An lithograph caption from 1869 calls it the Snake River Pass.Alfred e. Mathews, Grays Peak, Gems of Rocky Mountain Scenery, self published, New York, 1869; pages are not numbered. Geography Argentine Pass is 0.94 miles (1.5 km) north of Argentine Peak and 0.95 miles (1.54 km) southwest of Mount Edwards. To the east is the valley of Leavenworth Creek, a tributary that joins the South Clear Creek south of Georgetown. To the west is the Horseshoe Basin, a deep glacial cirque at the head of the Peru Creek, a tributary that joins the Snake River just north of Montezuma. The continental divide at Argentine Pass serves as the boundary between Clear Creek and Summit counties. The pass was formerly used by a toll road and stagecoach route. The trail on the west side of the pass is the remains of this road. To the east, the Argentine Central Railway ran from Georgetown to the pass from 1906 to 1918. The Jeep trail to the pass follows the grade of this abandoned railroad. History On Sept. 14, 1864, former provisional territorial governor Robert Steele, along with James Huff and Robert Layton discovered silver high on the slopes of McClellan Mountain, 1.85 mi (2.97 km) north of what we now call Argentine Pass.Aaron Frost, Clear Creek County, History of Clear Creek and Boulder Valley, Colorado, O.L. Baskin & Co., 1880; page 278. The mountains of this region are predominantly granite and gneiss, with veins containing silver-rich galena and blende (sphalerite), as well as iron pyrite, cupriferous pyrite (chalcopyrite), and some tetrahedrite.Josiah Spurr and George Garrey, Chapter II -- History and Production of Mines, Economic Geology of the Georgetown Quadrangle, Colorado, Government Printing Office, 1908; page 104 discusses the ore body, page 173 discusses the history of the ore discovery. This was the first major discovery of silver ore in Colorado. They named the deposit the Belmont Lode (from the French for beautiful mountain), and the surrounding area came to be known as the Argentine mining district (from argentum, Latin for silver). The discovery led to the growth of Georgetown as an early center of the silver mining industry in Colorado, although development was slowed by a general ignorance of how to properly treat the ore, by the high cost of transportation from the mines, and by the climate at that altitude. Eventually, both sides of the pass were heavily mined, and the district was divided into the East Argentine and West Argentine Districts, divided by the pass.Rossiter W. Raymond, Chapter VIII -- Colorado, Mining and Metallurgical Industry of the United States, J.B. Ford & Co, 1876; page 352.Edward L. Berthoud, On Rifts of Ice in the Rocks Near the Summit of Mt. McClellan, Colorado, and on the Different Limits of Vegetation on Adjoining Summits in the Territory, American Journal of Science and Arts, Vol. XI, No, LXII (Feb. 1876); page 108. Many remains of mining activity remain visible today. Work began on a toll road over Argentine Pass in 1869; the toll was typically one dollar for a team and wagon. In 1883, the road was purchased by Clear Creek and Summit County as a public highway; in the same year, the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad reached Dillon, diverting most of the freight traffic from the toll road. The stagecoach fare from Georgetown to Chihuahua, 15 miles away by road over the pass, was $2.50 in 1885.Crofutt's Grip-sack Guide of Colorado Vol II, Overland Publishing, Omaha, 1885; page 81. Under county management, the road was never well maintained, and it gradually became impassable to teams and wagons.T. S. Lovering, Geology and Ore Deposits of the Montezuma Quadrangle, Colorado, Professional Paper 178, United States Geological Survey, 1935; page 66 discusses the history of the toll road, page 111 discusses the Vidler Tunnel. The town of Waldorf was established as a rest stop on the east side of the pass. In 1875, the Hayden Survey reported the Argentine Pass wagon road to be the highest wagon road in Colorado; at the time, it was the primary route from Georgetown to the mining camps in the Blue River Valley (Breckenridge and Montezuma).Gustavus R. Bechler, Geographical Report on the Middle and South Parks, Colorado, and Adjacent Country, Chapter I: The Crest of the Main Rocky Mountains from Latitude 40¬∞ 30' to Tennessee Pass (130 Mi), Ninth Annual Report of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories Embracing Colorado and parts of Adjacent Territories, Being a Report of Progress of the Exploration for the Year 1875, F. V. Hayden, ed., Government Printing Office, 1877; page 376. Colorado Telephone laid the first telephone line across Argentine Pass in 1899; this was a twisted-pair line resting directly on the ground, but it was replaced a year later with submarine cable. The cable, which carried 6 toll lines required intensive maintenance and was entirely replaced 3 times before its use was abandoned in 1909. Conies (pikas) chewing on the line caused major damage, as did rock slides. From 1909 to 1916, twisted pair lines were used again, with annual replacement. Finally, in the summer of 1916, Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company installed a heavily engineered overhead line, hauling supplies by rail to Waldorf and then onward by pack train. This line, only 1.3 miles long, was built at over 7 times the cost per mile of a comparable line in more forgiving territory; the cost was justified because it was the only telephone connection from Denver to Leadville and the western half of the state.Philip H. Dexter, The Denver- Leadville Toll Line Via Argentine Pass, the Mountain States Monitor, Nov. 1917; page 2, with many illustrations. In mid 1909, the Central Colorado Power Co. began delivering power over the Shoshone Transmission Line from Glenwood Springs to Denver.Charles W. Henderson, Chapter 7 -- Production, history and mine development, Geology and Ore Deposits of the Leadville Mining District, Colorado professional paper 148, government printing office, 1927; page 134. This three-phase 90 kV line was split into two parallel lines as much as a mile apart for the 3-mile segment that crossed Argentine Pass from below Waldorf on the east to Argentine on the west (both are ghost towns today).High-Tension Transmission Experience in Central Colorado, Electrical World, Vol. 58, No. 15 (Oct. 7, 1911); page 871.Re: Colorado Power Co., Decision No. 527 Public Utilities Reports 1922D, Public Utilities Reports Inc, 1922; page 809. As currently routed, this line crosses the continental divide 1.25 miles (2.02 km) south of Argentine Pass, just south of Argentine Peak. The Vidler Tunnel under Argentine Pass began with the Horseshoe tunnel, a silver mine. Reese Vidler purchased the mine in 1902 with a plan to extend it under the continental divide as a railroad tunnel. Tunneling progressed about 700 feet from the west portal and 5110 feet from the east portal before work stopped in 1911 (after several changes in ownership). In 1952, Herbert T. Young purchased the unfinished tunnel, along with water rights on the west side of the divide, intending to finish the tunnel as a water tunnel.Herbert Court Young, About the Author, Understanding Water Rights and Conflicts 2nd Ed., Burg Young Publishing, Denver, 2006; page 5. The 1.4 mile tunnel was completed in late 1968, and is currently owned by the City of Golden. In 2007, major repairs were completed to the east portal and the mined-out area of the Flossie Vein. This water diversion project has a capacity of 31.5 cubic feet per second (0.892m3/s) with an average annual diversion of around 650 acre- feet (800,000m3).John N. Winchester, A Historical View: Transmountain Development in Colorado , 2000; retrieved July, 2015.2007 Vidler Tunnel Repairs: Flossie Vein Collapse Area and East Portal Rebuild; retrieved July, 2015. Climate The peak wind speed recorded at the pass as of 1912 was 165 miles per hour (265 km/h), at which point the measuring equipment was blown away. Temperatures as low as -59 ¬∞F (-51 ¬∞C) were recorded, along with snow drifts as deep as 30 feet (9 meters) and persisting until August. This climate data appears to have been taken by the builders of the Shoshone Transmission Line.A 100,000-Volt Transmission on the Roof of the Continent, Electrical World, Vol. 59, No. 22 (June 1, 1912); page 1205. The Road Today Vehicle travel is only possible on the Georgetown side of the pass during the summer months by a four-wheel drive vehicle with high-clearance. The trail on the Horseshoe Basin side is only accessible by foot or by mountain bike. The pass is the highest point on the American Discovery Trail.

He was the most famous among the Seven True Taoists of the North. He was the founder of the Dragon Gate sect of Taoism attracting the largest following in the streams of traditions flowing from the sects of the disciples. History In 1219 Genghis Khan invited Changchun to visit him in a letter dated 15 May 1219 by present reckoning. Changchun left his home in Shandong in February 1220 and journeyed to Beijing. Learning that Genghis had gone West, he spent winter there. In February 1221, Changchun left, traversing eastern Mongolia to the camp of Genghis' youngest brother Otchigin near Lake Buyur in the upper Kerulen - today's Kherlen-Amur basin. From there he traveled southwestward up the Kerulen, crossing the Karakorum region in north-central Mongolia, and arrived at the Altai Mountains, probably passing near the present Uliastai. After traversing the Altai he visited Bishbalig - modern √úr√ºmqi - and moved along the north side of the Tian Shan range to Lake Sutkol, today's Sairam, Almaliq (or Yining City), and the rich valley of the Ili. From there, Changchun passed to Balasagun and Shu River, and across that river to Talas and the Tashkent region, and then over the Syr Darya to Samarkand, where he halted for some months. Finally, through the Iron Gates of Termit, over the Amu Darya, and by way of Balkh and northern Afghanistan, Changchun reached Genghis' camp near the Hindu Kush. Changchun, had been invited to satisfy the interest of Genghis Khan in \\"the philosopher's stone\\" and the secret medicine of immortality. He explained the Taoist philosophy and the many ways to prolong life and was honest in saying there was no secret medicine of immortality. The two had 12 in-depth conversations.(Chinese) ËÉ°ÂàÉ, \\"ÊàêÂêâÊÄùÊ±ó‰∏é‰∏òÂ§ÑÊú∫\\" ÂåóÊñπÊñ∞Êä•(ÂëºÂíåÊµ©Áâπ) 2014-10-20 Genghis Khan honoured him with the title Spirit Immortal. Genghis also made Changchun in charge of all religious persons in the empire. Their conversations were recorded in the book Xuan Feng Qing Hui Lu. The Yenisei area had a community of weavers of Chinese origin and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by Changchun. After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them. Returning home, Changchun largely followed his outward route, with certain deviations, such as a visit to Hohhot. He was back in Beijing by the end of January 1224. From the narrative of his expedition, Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun written by his pupil and companion Li Zhichang, we derive some of the most vivid pictures ever drawn of nature and man between the Great Wall of China and Kabul, between the Aral and Yellow Seas. Of particular interest are the sketches of the Mongols and the people of Samarkand and its vicinity, the account of the land and products of Samarkand in the Ili Valley at or near Almalig-Kulja, and the description of various great mountain ranges, peaks and defiles, such as the Chinese Altay, the Tian Shan, Bogdo Uula, and the Iron Gates of Termit. There is, moreover, a noteworthy reference to a land apparently identical with the uppermost valley of the Yenisei. After his return, Changchun lived in Beijing until his death on 23 July 1227. By order of Genghis Khan, some of the former imperial garden grounds were given to him for the foundation of a Taoist Monastery of the White Clouds that exists to this day. There is a story about the Earth Deity, Tu Di, and the Founding Ancestor Qiu Chuji, which is recounted in the Records of the Golden Lotuses‚Äô Immortals: È©¨‰∏πÈò≥ËßâÂæó‰∫ãÊÉÖÂ•áÊÄ™ÔºåÂ∞±ÈóÆ‰∏òÂ§ÑÊú∫ÔºöÊàëÂíå‰Ω†Âú®Â∫ô‰∏≠ÂÜªÈ•ø‰∫Ü‰∏âÂ§©ÔºåÂ∞±ÊúâÂúüÂú∞ÊâòÊ¢¶ÂñÑ‰∫∫ÈÄÅÊù•ÊñãÈ•≠„ÄÇÂ∏àÂºüÔºå ‰Ω†ÊòØ‰∏çÊòØÂä®Â¶ÑÂøµ‰∫ÜÔºü‚Äù‰∏òÂ§ÑÊú∫‰∏çÊï¢ÈöêÁûíÔºåÂ¶ÇÂÆûÁõ∏ÂëäÔºåÂõ†‰ªñÈ••ÂØíÈöæËÄêÔºåÈöæ‰ª•ÂÆàÊåÅÔºå‰∫éÊòØÂä®‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÂøµÔºåÂ∏åÊúõ Êúâ‰∫∫ÈÄÅ‰∫õÊ±§Èù¢ÊöñË∫´„ÄÇÂèØÊòØÊ≤°ÊúâÊÉ≥Âà∞ÔºåÁ•ûÊòéÊûúÁÑ∂Áü•ÈÅì‰ªñÁöÑÂøÉÂøµÔºåÁúüÁöÑÂ∞±ÂéªÂñÑ‰∫∫ÂÆ∂ÊâòÊ¢¶‰∫Ü„ÄÇÈ©¨‰∏πÈò≥‰∏ÄÂê¨ÔºåÊÄíÈÅìÔºö‚ÄúÊàë‰∫ãÂÖàÊúâË®ÄÂê©Âíê‰∫é‰Ω†Ôºå‰øÆÈÅì‰πã‰∫∫‰∏çÂèØÂä®ÂøÉÂ¶ÑÊÉ≥„ÄÇ‰Ω†‰ªäÊó•Ëµ∑‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÂøµÔºåÂ∞±ÊëáÂä®ËôöÁ©∫Á•ûÊòéÂà∞‰ªñÂÆ∂ÊâòÊ¢¶ÔºåÊàëÂíå‰Ω†Áé∞Âú®Êó•Êó†ÂØ∏Ëøõ‰πãÂäüÔºåÂèçËÄåÂèó‰ªñÁöÑ‰æõÂÖªÔºåÊúâ‰ΩïÁ¶èÂàÜËÉΩÂ§üÊâøÂΩìÔºüÂ¶ÇÊûúÊàëÂíå‰Ω†‰∏ÄÊ†∑ÔºåÂ∞ÜÊù•ÂèØÊòØË¶ÅÂèòÁâõÂèòÈ©¨ÂéªËøòÂÄ∫ÁöÑÔºåÂÄí‰∏çÂ¶ÇÁé∞Âú®ÂêÑËá™ÂàÜÂºÄÔºåÊàëÂõûÂ±±‰∏ú‰øÆÂÖªÔºå‰ªªÂá≠‰Ω†Â§©Â†ÇÂú∞Áã±‰πãË∑ØÔºå‰Ω†Â∞±ÈöèÂøÉÊâÄÊ¨≤ÁöÑÂéªÂêß„ÄÇ Ma Dan Yang [one of the Seven Realized Disciples of Wang Chong Yang], feeling that the matter was strange, asked Qiu Chu Ji [-Founding Ancestor Qiu-] directly: You and I were freezing and hungry in the temple for three days, and it was exactly then that the Earth Spirit appeared in the dream of a benevolent person to get them to deliver vegetarian food to us. Younger religious brother, were you stirred by abstruse thoughts? Qiu Chu Ji did not dare to hide anything. He told things as they really were, because his hunger and coldness were difficult to tolerate, difficult to safeguard and uphold. Therefore, stirred by one thought alone, he hoped for someone to bring him a few noodles in soup to warm up his body. But he had not thought that the Spirit Lights sure enough would know his Heart-Mind‚Äôs thinking, and would truly visit the home of a benevolent person to send them Spirit messages in a dream. When Ma Dan Yang heard this, he angrily replied: I had spoken with you beforehand to give you instruction: people who cultivate the Dao are not allowed to stir their Heart-Mind and have abstruse thoughts. Today you gave rise to a thought, which has swayed the hollow void‚Äôs Spirit Lights to reach a person‚Äôs home and appear in their dream. Every day now, as a result, you and I [in our practice] will be unable to enter this Gong by even an inch. On the contrary, what good fortune will receiving the offerings made to him [the Earth Spirit] bring us now? If you and I were the same, but in the future wanted to transform into oxen and into horses in order to repay a debt [of karma], it would be better for each of us to separate. I will return to Shandong province to cultivate and nourish [-accomplish myself in self- cultivation-], for no matter whether your road leads to the Heavenly Hall or Earthly Prison, you go following your Heart-Mind [inclinations] and what it desires. Fiction Qiu Chuji appears as a character in Jin Yong's Legend of the Condor Heroes, Return of the Condor Heroes, and the 2013 film An End to Killing. In Jin Yong's work he is very different from the real persona, described as a 'bullheaded priest' who gets into fights and contests with rivals, very contrary to what his religion preaches. His deeds shape much of the future of the 2 main male characters of the first story. References =Citations= =Bibliography= * E.

Founded in February 1993, it was among the earliest parties in the Russian Federation. History The Agrarian Party of Russia was founded on 26 February 1993, by the head of the Altai Republic, Mikhail Lapshin and Vasily Starodubtsev, governor of the Tula region and former member of the USSR's State Committee on the State of Emergency. During their leadership (1993-2004), the party made an alliance with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Fatherland ‚Äì All Russia bloc. Until 2008, the party supported agrarian socialism and collectivism. Founder Mikhail Lapshin led the party until 2004; its most recent leader was Vladimir Plotnikov. In the legislative elections in December 1993, the Agrarian Party obtained 37 seats in the Duma and won 8% of the popular vote. Between 1994 and 1996, one of its party members, Ivan Rybkin, was the speaker of the Russian Parliament. In the legislative elections in December 1995, the APR did not make it over the 5% threshold, obtaining only 3.78% of the votes. In the legislative elections on 7 December 2003, the party won 3.6% of the popular vote and three out of 450 seats in the parliament. Agrarian Party member Nikolay Kharitonov ran as a presidential candidate from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in the 2004 Russian presidential election and won 13.7% of the votes, coming out second to Vladimir Putin. In the 1990s, party deputies were usually allies of the Communist Party in the State Duma and advocated greater government support for the agricultural sector. The party won 2.30% of the votes in the 2007 elections, did not break the 7% barrier, and thus, had no seats in the Duma. The Agrarian Party supported the candidacy of Dmitry Medvedev in the 2008 Russian presidential election. It later merged with United Russia‚Äîthe party that currently holds the most seats in the Duma.  Refounding  The year 2012 marked an especially notable period for the party as it was officially restored, and the registered leader Olga Bashmachnikova was elected Executive Director of the Agricultural Association on May 18. This led the party to take a new direction, moving away from the ideologies of agrarian socialism and collectivism towards centrism. The party has abandoned the Alliance with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), which was in the union since its foundation.

Located on Fulton Street between Kingston and Throop Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, it is served by the C train at all times except nights, when the A train takes over service. History The Kingston‚ÄîThroop Avenues station was constructed as part of the IND Fulton Street Line, the main line of the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND)'s main line from Downtown Brooklyn to southern Queens. The groundbreaking for the line was held on April 16, 1929, at Fulton Street and Arlington Place. This station opened on April 9, 1936, as part of an extension of the Independent Subway System (IND) from its previous Brooklyn terminus at Jay Street‚ÄìBorough Hall, which opened three years earlier, to Rockaway Avenue. The new IND subway replaced the BMT Fulton Street Elevated, and this station replaced its Brooklyn‚ÄìTompkins Avenues station, which closed on May 31, 1940. Under the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Plan, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, were to have undergone a complete overhaul and would have been entirely closed for up to six months. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. However, most of these renovations are being deferred until the 2020-2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding. Station layout Eastbound street entrance This underground station has four tracks and two noticeably offset side platforms, with the southbound platform located roughly 300 feet further west (railroad north) than the northbound platform. The two center tracks are used by the A express train during daytime hours. The platforms have name tiles that read \\"KINGSTON - THROOP AV.\\" in white sans serif lettering on two lines on a dark yellow background with a yellow trim line. Beneath the name tiles are small black station signs directing riders to either \\"KINGSTON\\" or \\"THROOP\\" Avenues in white lettering. The platforms are columnless except for a few dark yellow I-beam ones near fare control. =Exits= Each platform has one same-level fare control area. The one on the Euclid Avenue- and Queens-bound platform is at the extreme west (railroad north) end and has a bank of three turnstiles, and two staircases going up to the each southern corners of Fulton Street and Kingston Avenue. The one on the Manhattan-bound platform is at the center and has a bank of four turnstiles, a full-time token booth, and two staircases going up to either northern corners of Fulton Street and Throop Avenue. Incidents This station was the site of a 1995 robbery that killed the token booth clerk, 50-year-old Harry Kaufman. Robbers squirted accelerant into the booth on the Euclid Avenue-bound platform and set the fumes alight with a match, causing an explosion that blew out the glass and deformed the booth. The incident drew national attention due to allegations that the movie Money Train (1995) inspired the murder. The allegations were unfounded and the movie's producer, Columbia Pictures, claimed that the scenes were inspired by an earlier event, in 1988, where another token booth clerk was killed in the same fashion.

Bellear served as a judge of the District Court of New South Wales from 1996 until his death in 2005. Early life Bellear was born in the far north-east of New South Wales, and grew up near the town of Mullumbimby. His grandfather was a Ni-Vanuatu man who was blackbirded to Australia to work on a sugar plantation, and his grandmother was an Aboriginal Australian woman from Minjerribah (also known as Stradbroke Island) in Queensland. His other grandfather had been blackbirded from the Solomon Islands. Bellear was one of nine children. He left school early, but could not get a job, a fact which Bellear often attributed to racism. Instead, he joined the Royal Australian Navy, where he was trained in mechanical engineering and clearance diving. He was a successful rugby union player for the Navy's representative side. He was the first Indigenous person to achieve the rank of petty officer. Bellear left the Navy in 1968, with several qualifications, including masonry and fitting and turning. He was then able to easily find a job. For some time Bellear lived in Redfern with his wife Kaye Williams, whom he had met while in the Navy. The suburb had a substantial Aboriginal population at the time. Bellear established the Aboriginal Housing Corporation there in 1972, and throughout the 1970s was a director of both the Aboriginal Medical Service and the Aboriginal Legal Service. Bellear was the leader of a campaign to prevent landlords in Redfern from evicting Aboriginal tenants, and his work led to the Whitlam government transferring ownership of The Block to the Aboriginal Housing Corporation. Legal education and career Bellear would regularly see the patterns of intimidation and harassment which the New South Wales Police practised against the Aboriginal community in Redfern. In 1972, Bellear decided that he would study law. He completed his Higher School Certificate studies at Sydney Technical College, and entered a law course at the University of New South Wales. He became only the second Indigenous person to graduate from that university (after Pat O'Shane) when he graduated in 1978. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1979. As a barrister, he represented many Aboriginal people in criminal trials, and was often instructed by the Aboriginal Legal Service. In 1987 Bellear was appointed as an assisting counsel to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In 1993 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by Macquarie University. On 17 May 1996, Bellear was appointed a judge of the District Court of New South Wales, the first Indigenous person to be appointed to any court in Australia. He served as a judge until his death. During this time he mentored young Indigenous lawyers, and encouraged students to attend his courtroom. He did not try to remain in Sydney, instead preferring the rural circuit, where he could visit Aboriginal communities in regional centres, and bring students into his courtroom. Personal life In his later life, Bellear was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, contracted during his time with the Royal Australian Navy, when as an apprentice engineer he was exposed to asbestos fibers. Bellear died at his home on 15 March 2005, wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt. He was survived by his wife, two children Joanne and Kali (a third son, Malu died in his early twenties in 1996) and four grandchildren. The Government of New South Wales granted Bellear a state funeral, held at the Sydney Town Hall. It was attended by about 2000 guests, including Governor of New South Wales Marie Bashir and former Chief Justice of New South Wales Laurence Street.

Biography Curran grew up in Rochester, New York, and was ordained there in 1958 for the Diocese of Rochester. After intensive graduate work and earning two doctorates in theology in Rome, Curran taught at the seminary in Rochester, New York. In 1965 he joined the theology faculty at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Contrary to some sources, he did not serve as a peritus or expert at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). That distinction belonged to Charles A.

Curran's tenure stream appointment lapse rather than reappoint him, primarily because of his dissenting views on contraception. After a faculty-led strike that included students, the university reversed its position on Curran two weeks later and the trustees not only reappointed him, but also promoted him to associate professor with tenure.Samuel J.

Curran then returned to prominence. In 1968 he was part of the group of 87 theologians that authored a response to Humanae Vitae, Pope Paul VI's encyclical affirming the traditional ban on artificial contraception. Curran continued to teach and write on the church's teaching on various moral issues, including premarital sex, masturbation, contraception, abortion, homosexual acts, divorce, euthanasia, and in vitro fertilization, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Curran was again removed from the faculty of the Catholic University of America in 1986 as a dissident against the Catholic Church's moral teaching. He maintains in his 1986 Faithful Dissent that Catholics who may dissent nevertheless accept the teaching authority of the Pope, bishops and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Curran contended in 1971 that homosexual acts, in the context of a committed relationship, fell short of the ideal but were to be considered good for homosexual people; he stated that \\"I had come to accept the moral legitimacy of a union of two gay men or lesbians.\\" In 1992, he said that \\"the official hierarchical Roman Catholic teaching should accept the moral value and goodness\\" of same-sex relationships, not excepting those that include sex. However, he has since recognized shortcomings in this argument, albeit without explicitly stating a change of position. Curran has stated that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith systematically attempted to silence authors critical of teachings on homosexuality, citing the \\"highlighting\\" of errors in Dr. John J. McNeill's The Church and the Homosexual. In 1986, the Vatican declared that Curran could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America schools, and he was neither suitable nor eligible to be a professor of Catholic theology. Curran sued the University for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract and lost. Universities, Teaching Eligibility, The Daily Washington Law Reporter, 4/3/89, Pages 653, 657 Although a tenured professor (Curran retained his tenure status, but his ecclesiastical mission to teach Catholic theology was revoked) \\"clashes with Church authorities finally culminated in a decision by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger [later Pope Benedict XVI],\\" The areas of dispute included publishing articles that debated theological and ethical views regarding divorce, \\"artificial contraception\\", \\"masturbation, pre-marital intercourse and homosexual acts.\\"http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9CA4679F-7BC7-4AD7-BA37-0C1B00AEBAA1/0/CatholicUUSA.pdf quoting Cardinal Ratzinger. Retrieved 2009-07-30. As noted in an American Association of University Professors (AAUP) report, \\"Had it not been for the intervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Professor Curran would undoubtedly still be active in the [Catholic University's] Department of Theology, a popular teacher, honored theologian, and respected colleague.\\" Curran's attorneys argued that CUA did not follow proper procedures or its own policy statements in handling the case. In essence, CUA claimed that the Vatican's actions against Curran trumped any campus-based policy or tenure rules. In 1989, he filed suit against Catholic University, and the court determined that the university had the right to fire him for teaching views in contradiction to the school's religion.Curran Loses Suit Against Catholic U.; Theology Professor's Dismissal Upheld While the controversy was unfolding, Curran taught as a visiting professor at Cornell University and Auburn University. Since then, Curran has taken a full tenured professorship at Southern Methodist University and has published personal accounts about his experience with the Roman Catholic Church and his viewpoint on the actions of Roman Catholic Church authorities. Since he continues to dissent from orthodox Catholic Church teaching, Curran has been deemed, by the Vatican, unfit to teach Catholic theology. Curran is a major financial benefactor of SMU's Catholic organization. He has remained a controversial figure. His invitation to speak at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland in 2006, was controversial, with the college president, Mgr. Dermot Farrell, denying any involvement without actually preventing him speaking.

Loosely based on the Marvel Universe character of the same name, he first appeared, in flashback, in Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's Ultimates (1st series) #2 (April 2002). Although he did appear in a two-part story in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up, written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by Phil Hester, it is generally considered to be out of continuity due to conflicting designs and characters; however, references made in the first issues of The Ultimates and the Ultimate Origins could be taken to reconcile some of this. Whereas the Marvel Universe Hulks are characters in their own right, Millar's Ultimate Universe Hulk is intended purely as a mirror of Banner ‚Äì a creature of pure rage and id, which simply incorporates the base emotions that Ultimate Banner represses, and amplifies them to absurd degrees. Unlike previous versions of the Hulk, he is primarily a villainous menace than an superhero and is also cannibalistic. Fictional character biography =Origin= Dr. Robert Bruce Banner was one of the leading scientists in the United States. He had a scientist named Leonard Williams as his teacher. He was later among the scientists that are used to recreate the Super-Soldier Formula that created Captain America. Bruce Banner is shown to have been hired by the U.S. Government and General Nick Fury as part of a project to secretly recreate the Super Soldier Serum. At a covert lab in Dover, New Jersey, Bruce works alongside fellow scientists, Hank Pym, Franklin Storm, father of Sue and Johnny Storm, and Richard Parker, father of Peter Parker.Ultimate Origins #3. Marvel Comics. Bruce believes that he has come up with the correct formula for the serum, but needs to test it out. Eager to try his results on a human subject, Banner synthesizes his serum and injects himself with it. The serum turns him into the Hulk for the very first time. Banner goes on a rampage inside the laboratory and eventually destroys the entire complex, nearly killing Richard Parker, along with his wife Mary, who had brought an infant Peter along with her to visit Richard.Ultimate Origins #4 Years later, Hulk laid waste to Chelsea Piers before he could be subdued by Spider-Man and taken into custody.Ultimate Marvel Team-Up #2. Marvel Comics. Banner and Henry Pym were both hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to create post-human soldiers for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Ultimates, with Banner focusing on the Super-Soldier formula responsible for Captain America, and Henry Pym experimenting with his Giant- Man formula. Whereas Pym found success and celebrity with \\"Giant-Man\\", Banner found himself unable to crack the Super-Soldier formula. Classifying himself a failure and suffering ridicule at the hands of Pym, Banner took some of the recently rediscovered Captain America's blood, combined it with his Hulk formula, and injected it. Banner rationalized his decision by saying that turning himself into a monster gave the Ultimates a villain to fight, thereby justifying their existence at a time when they were accused of being an enormous multi-billion dollar waste of government resources. Before lapsing into unconsciousness however, Banner confessed that \\"honest-to-God truth of the matter\\" is that he simply \\"just missed being big.\\"Ultimates #3. Marvel Comics. Shortly afterwards, Banner transformed into a sociopathic grey-skinned Hulk that channeled and amplified Banner's hidden emotions, unleashing the darkest depths of his id. The Hulk proceeded to track down and pursue Betty Ross, the object of Bruce Banner's affection who, because of relationship problems with Banner, was courting the favor of Hollywood film star Freddie Prinze, Jr. that night, and inadvertently boasted about it to Banner over the phone shortly before his transformation. During his rampage and cross-town pursuit of the fleeing Betty Ross, The Hulk informed Betty that he was \\"horny as Hell\\" and destroyed everything in his path, indiscriminately killing hundreds of people in the process. After rendering Giant-Man unconscious and overpowering Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor, who were all dispatched to stop his rampage, The Hulk changed back into Banner after the Wasp entered his skull through the ear canal and fired her bio-electric sting directly into his brain. Upon regaining consciousness, Banner was promptly knocked unconscious, restrained and shuttled away to S.H.I.E.L.D., the connection between him and the Ultimate Hulk covered up. Later, after being subdued by the Ultimates, an examination on Banner's blood revealed that the latest Super-Soldier Formula he took has placed a more permanent effect on Banner. The \\"Hulk cells\\" were not disappearing like they did after the first time Banner transformed, showing that the new Super-Soldier Formula Banner took would forever keep the Hulk within him.Ultimates #4. Marvel Comics. =Homeland Security= After his rampage, Banner spent a number of months in a cell specifically designed to withstand the Hulk's fury, with Anti-Hulk serum administered to him on a continuous basis. Amidst the Chitauri's assault on Earth and their takeover of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States Armed Forces, General Fury quickly mobilized an army and attacked the alien base in Arizona. During his battle with Herr Kleiser, a Chitauri agent capable of absorbing and administering enormous physical damage, Captain America, with all other tactical options exhausted, gave the order for \\"the Weapon of Last Resort\\" and gave \\"Permission to traumatize Banner,\\" who was in a helicopter with a military escort hovering over the S.H.I.E.L.D. battlefield. The delicate procedure of traumatizing a 90-pound scientist simply amounted to throwing him out of the chopper in hopes that his anger would overcome the effects of the anti-Hulk serum coursing through his veins. It did. The Hulk's first course of action was to bodyslam Captain America into the concrete to pay him back for breaking Banner's jaw after the first Hulk transformation in Manhattan. Captain America immediately pointed out Herr Kleiser, declaring that he had been \\"all over Betty\\" while Banner was in his solitary cell. Not one to be overshadowed by a skinny German Nazi, the Hulk promptly pounded Kleiser to a pulp and even ate him. While Hulk was dining on Kleiser, Captain America manipulated him once more by calling down to him, telling Hulk that the Chitauri alien fleet had called him a \\"sissy-boy\\" and asked if the Hulk intended to let the aliens get away with such an insult. In a most vigorous defense of his heterosexuality, Hulk leaped a mile into the air, ripping apart the entire airborne alien fleet that clouded the sky, all the while proclaiming that \\"Hulk no Sissy Boy...HULK STRAIGHT!\\" Even after destroying the entire fleet and saving what remained of the day, the Hulk was full of adrenaline and rage, and needed to be sedated. Hawkeye, the marksman, was called in to take him down with an adamantium- tipped syringe full of anti-Hulk serum. Hawkeye did, but barely succeeded since Hulk seemed to be impervious to the antidote Hawkeye shot into Hulk before he finally passed out. While Banner returned to normal while in containment in S.H.I.E.L.D., his caretakers monitored him closely. Because of Herr Kleiser's shapeshifting abilities, Banner's stool were collected and properly disposed of after the battle, to rule out the possibility of Kleiser reconstituting himself in a cunning, if disgusting, way.Ultimates #13. Marvel Comics. When Magneto attacked the Triskelion's lockup during the \\"Ultimate War\\" series, power went down for the entire facility. The Hulk was said to have eaten six members of the nursing staff in the chaos.Ultimate War #2. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Ultimate Six\\" storyline, the Triskelion was attacked by Electro and the Green Goblin, but Banner was later reported to have \\"fallen asleep reading a magazine\\" and was promptly sedated for a week, just in case.Ultimate Six #1. Marvel Comics. Banner remained in his cell for a year, with very few Hulk episodes; during one such transformation, he sat on the couch and watched Curb Your Enthusiasm until he changed back. The few visitors he received included Hank Pym, demonstrating his new \\"Ant Man\\" technology. Shortly thereafter, he learned from the national news that somebody had leaked top-secret information to the press regarding the Hulk/Banner connection. S.H.I.E.L.D. hired lawyer Matt Murdock to try and avoid the death penalty for 800+ murder counts by bringing up the important things Banner had done in the interests of national security, and his work for the Ultimates. During jury deliberation, Banner received a visit from General Nick Fury, who told him that the case had been dismissed, and presented him with a bottle of champagne. Eagerly drinking his first drink as a free man, Banner passed out ‚Äì the bottle had been drugged by Hank Pym at Fury's request ‚Äì and awakened much later on the deck of an aircraft carrier, with a one- megaton nuclear weapon nearby. Fortunately for his well-being, he transformed into the Hulk right before the nuclear device was detonated. Later, Banner anonymously called Pym from a public telephone to thank him for deliberately botching the dose before Banner decided to go into hiding. It is not clear if Pym deliberately botched the dose, or was merely incompetent in his research.Ultimates 2 #3. Marvel Comics. Bruce Banner later appears in Washington D.C. before one of the Crimson Dynamo's giant duplicates, letting it step on him, all the while muttering to himself about being \\"in touch with his inner sociopath.\\" The Hulk appears in the next panel, lifting the robot with both hands and then ripping it in two, finishing the issue with a declaration of, \\"NOW BRING IT ON!\\"Ultimates 2 #11. Marvel Comics. He then continues to aid the Ultimates against the Liberators by defeating, dismembering, and finally eating the Abomination.Ultimates 2 #12. Marvel Comics. =Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk= Some time after Banner's disappearance, strange occurrences across Europe and Asia reported. General Fury started piecing together the evidence and concluded that despite their distance from one another, they were all related. The discovery of feces in Tibet belonging to Banner confirmed that he had survived his execution. Since S.H.I.E.L.D. was in charge of executing Banner in a very public way, they acted to cover up their error by contracting James \\"Logan\\" Howlett (Wolverine) to track Banner down and eliminate him. Logan arrives at a rural village in Tibet and discovers that all the women have been kidnapped. He eventually makes his way to a beautiful but derelict palace. The Hulk (decked in Tibetan robes and beads) has taken up residence here with the kidnapped women as his concubines. The Hulk is annoyed at being interrupted and he and Wolverine fight. After an intense struggle, the Hulk physically rips Wolverine's body in half and hurls his legs four miles up a mountain, leaving Logan's torso to freeze in the snow.Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #1. Marvel Comics. Issue #2 reveals, in flashback, that Bruce Banner, after travelling through France, Ireland and India, finally treks to Tibet, to seek the wisdom of the Panchen Lama who he hopes can reveal the true relationship behind Banner and the Hulk. It is here that the Hulk resides prior to Logan's intrusion.Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #2. Marvel Comics. =Later appearances= He then appeared together with Iron Man in their own mini-series titled Ultimate Human, focusing on Bruce Banner approaching Tony Stark about the possibility of using the Iron Man nanites to control the Hulk transformations. The Leader is introduced as Pete Wisdom, a scientist after the blood of both men, for use in the creation of a superhuman. This series depicts the Hulk's physiology as almost infinitely adaptive to adverse conditions, including simulations of hostile extraterrestrial environments such as the surface of the planet Venus. It also described him as generating carbon Fullerenes in his skin structure, adding to his durability.Ultimate Human #1. Marvel Comics. A naked Hulk comes into a restaurant demanding food. Princess Zarda who is already at the restaurant fights and defeats the Hulk. After the fight, the two form a bond and go to another restaurant before renting a motel room and having sex.Ultimate Hulk Annual #1. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Ultimatum\\" storyline, the Hulk appears in New York and is convinced by Spider-Man to help him rescue people. When demons start appearing they go to the home of Doctor Strange, only to learn that his body had been possessed by Nightmare. He then starts to torture them. Hulk in response heats the Orb of Acmantata, which causes an explosion.Ultimate Spider-Man #132 He survives and is recruited by the remaining Ultimates and X-Men to stop Magneto. In Magneto's Citadel, he and Colossus are tasked with destroying some of the citadel's machinery. They try to stop Mystique and Sabretooth from escaping, but fail. Hulk survives Ultimatum and is later seen in Ultimate Comics: X in a soup kitchen as Bruce Banner in New York. He is convinced by Karen Grant to be their \\"enforcer\\" in a new team sponsored by former Director Nick Fury.Wolverine's son vs. Sabretooth in Ultimate X 5Ultimate X #5. Marvel Comics. During the European crisis involving the Children of Tomorrow, Hulk was convinced by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Flumm to attack the Children of Tomorrow in exchange for the safety of Betty Ross, currently in custody. Hulk was unleashed in Children's base called The City, but the Maker managed to calm him down and convince him that he was being used. In that moment, the US Government launched an ineffective nuclear attack on the City, and the Children detonate an anti-matter bomb in Washington, D.C. in retaliation. When the Ultimates finally turned the tide, the Maker injected the Hulk with the Giant-Man serum, turning him into a giant juggernaut, although he was defeated and put into sedated custody beneath the Triskelion once more.Ultimate Comics Ultimates #12. Marvel Comics. Bruce was freed by the mysterious woman called Kang, and convinced him to steal the Infinity Gems with which he battled the Ultimates. After the arrival of escapee Reed Richards, the heroes escaped, but Captain America decided to be left behind in order to stop the villains, although he was defeated by Thor.Ultimate Comics Ultimates #25. Marvel Comics. When Maker merged all realities in order to help Eternity to fight the First Firmament, Hulk is among the Ultimates members that are revived.Ultimates 2 Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics. It was shown that Hulk didn't retain his intelligence and referred to himself in the third person. When the Ultimates of Earth-616 arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker for his actions, he had the Earth-1610 Ultimates fight the Earth-616 Ultimates where Hulk was thrown out of the building by Blue Marvel. Eventually, Hulk and the rest of the Earth-1610 Ultimates decided that there was no reason to fight the Earth-616 Ultimates which resulted in Maker killing the Earth-1610 Captain America. After aiding the Earth-616 Ultimates into giving Eternity the power to defeat the First Firmament, Hulk and the rest of the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue Maker.Ultimates 2 #100. Marvel COmics. After Earth-1610 was restored, Hulk was seen with the Avengers where they help Spider-Man fight Green Goblin.Spider- Men II #5. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Banner's powers are a result of his Hulk formula combined with Captain America's blood, which causes him to transform when under stress into a gigantic monstrous form that is virtually impervious to harm, and which possesses vast physical strength and stamina. His strength appears to be peerless in the Ultimate universe, as he tosses heavy-hitters such as Iron Man and Thor around like dolls and ripped the Adamantium needle prepared for him like a toothpick. He also tore Wolverine in half despite the presence of his Adamantium laced skeleton. He is also tough enough to survive a nuclear detonation, seeing as how he is still alive after the attempted execution. Hulk can regenerate tissue and broken bones almost instantly, making him an almost impossible enemy to defeat; so far only two defeats have been witnessed, both involving forced transition back to Banner. Firstly where Hulk was suffered Wasp's \\"stings\\" directly to his frontal lobes, followed by impact trauma incurred from a height upwards of five thousand feet. Secondly, Hulk can be forcibly transformed back to Banner form through direct injection of a serum created by Bruce Banner himself; injection is possible only via adamantium needle that can either be directly applied, or fired into the target. The second option was employed by Hawkeye (under General Fury's command) after the alien invasion had been defeated at the end of Ultimates vol. 1, in the aptly-named issue \\"How I Learned To Love The Hulk\\". = Personality and behavior = This Hulk, like many Ultimate Marvel characters, has base similarities to his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart coupled with differences. He is very angry and has not shown much intelligence, like the Savage Hulk. However, the Ultimate Marvel version of Hulk is a lot more vicious and violent than his mainstream counterpart. For example, Hulk has ripped Ultimate Wolverine in half and ripped off Herr Kleiser's head. Further, he once threatened to rip out Hank Pym's skull and use it as a toilet. This Hulk is also just as mucho more sexual. On many occasions, Hulk has yelled out to Betty, telling her how \\"horny\\" he is and he also surrounded himself with beautiful women in Tibet. Finally, the Ultimate version of Hulk is a cannibal, as demonstrated in Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk #2, where the Hulk devours his farm coworkers for making fun of Banner's being a vegan and questioning his sexuality. In other media The Hulk appears in Ultimate Avengers with Bruce Banner voiced by Michael Massee and Hulk voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In the movie, he appears as a scientist for the Avengers. It was revealed that the Hulk ruins Banner's work, identity, and his relationships. In order to help the Avengers, Banner planned to use the Super Soldier serum to take control of the Hulk. According to him, transmutations can be controlled by the serum. As Banner transforms into the Hulk while breathing a dose of the serum, he successfully take control of the Hulk, and speaks while in that form. Unfortunately, while fighting the Chautauri aliens, Banner loses control, and became mindless. Betty was able to inject him a serum, and was transformed back. After a while, Banner was now imprisoned. The Hulk appears in the sequel of the movie titled Ultimate Avengers: Rise of the Black Panther, with Bruce Banner voiced again by Michael Massee and Hulk voiced again by Fred Tatasciore. Banner was still imprisoned and was forced to watch of the Hulk's actions. He found the reason why he lost control of his Hulk form which he wouldn't tell anyone but Betty. It turned out some of the gamma from the Chitauri's ship caused Banner to lose control of his Hulk form. In the end, he transformed and escapes during the Chitauri attack. Though he does get one last look at Betty before fleeing.

It was a subsidiary of cable television company Comcast from 2008 to 2017. At one point it offered a social networking service. History The company was founded by Sean Parker and two Stanford University engineering students, Todd Masonis and Cameron Ring. Rikk Carey joined Plaxo at its inception and led engineering and products for six years as Executive Vice President. Funded by venture capital including funds from Sequoia Capital, the service officially launched on November 12, 2002. On July 7, 2005, Plaxo announced it had struck a deal with America Online to integrate its contact management service with its AOL and AOL Instant Messenger products. In January 2007, Plaxo was criticized by technology journalist David Coursey, who was upset about receiving a number of requests from Plaxo users to update their contact information (similar to spam email), and who wondered how the company was planning to make money from a free service that collects personal contact and network information. However, after \\"changes at Plaxo and discussions with the company's remaining co- founders\\", Coursey reversed his stance. Plaxo also responded to these issues in a section of their website. On May 7, 2007, Comcast announced that it had partnered with Plaxo in the launch of its universal communications service, SmartZone. On August 4, 2007 Plaxo announced the public beta of a social networking service called Plaxo Pulse. The service enabled sharing of content from multiple different sources across the social web, including blogs, photos, social networking services, rating services, and others.

It was the first permanent trade organization for railroad workers in the US. A year later it was renamed the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (B of LE). The B of LE took its present name in 2004 when it became a division of the Rail Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). In the 19th century, the Brotherhood generally took a conciliatory approach in dealing with railroad management, preferring to negotiate reasonable demands than to go on strike. The brotherhood was seen as elitist by other railway unions, and sometimes came into conflict during strikes. However, it was respected by its members. By 1925 it had accumulated large investments to support member benefits and pensions. That year it was found that some of these investments were troubled. The executives launched into risky projects in an attempt to recoup their losses, which failed, forcing a change in leadership. The new grand chief engineer, Alvanley Johnston, steered the union until 1950. In 1946 negotiations with the government of Harry S. Truman broke down and the union went on strike for two days, causing nationwide havoc, before coming to an agreement on hours and wages. In 2004 the Brotherhood merged with the Teamsters. History =Foundation= right An early attempt to form a union for locomotive engineers was made on 6‚Äì9 November 1855 at a meeting in Baltimore at which it was agreed to form a \\"National Protective Association of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers of the United States.\\" Benjamin Hoxie was elected President, and William D. Robinson secretary. The organization held a number of meetings up to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, but did not make much progress. In April 1863 nineteen locomotive engineers met at Robinson's house and decided to form the Brotherhood. At a meeting on 8 May 1863 in Detroit the name \\"Brotherhood of the Footboard\\" was chosen and Robinson was elected as the first grand chief engineer. It was a mutual aid society which created a variety of accident, death and burial insurance programs for its members. According to Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa, the BLE was America's earliest labor union. It was the first of the \\"Big Four\\" of railroad worker brotherhoods. The others were the Order of Railway Conductors (1868), the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (1873) and the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen (1883). In the era after the founding of the Big Four, some sixteen other \\"brotherhoods\\" of railroad trades organized. Membership qualifications across trades shifted, and the alliances among the brotherhoods (and their chapters) are not always clear. =Expansion (1864‚Äì1903)= Following a disastrous strike in July 1864 by employees of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, in which half of the strikers lost their jobs, the Brotherhood of the Footboard held a convention in Indianapolis on 17 August 1864 in which they changed their name to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and replaced Grand Chief Engineer Robinson with Charles Wilson. The first, radical, phase of the union was over. In 1873 the Pennsylvania Railroad ordered a reduction of pay, and the engineers went on strike. Charles Wilson publicly criticized their action. The Brotherhood called a special meeting in Cleveland on 25 February 1874 at which Wilson was forced to resign and was replaced by P.M. Arthur. When Arthur took over, the country was entering a financial depression after the Civil War boom. Wages were unstable, working conditions were poor, and strikes were frequent. Arthur was able to prevent wages from falling further through effective negotiation, and the union became more powerful, and was held in good esteem by the union members and the railroad managers. After 1877, the BLE was considered less militant than some other brotherhoods, as well as the Knights of Labor and the American Railway Union. Arthur died unexpectedly on 17 July 1903, and the Grand Assistant Chief A.B. Youngson became head of the union. Youngson was on his deathbed, and died on 31 July 1903. =Stone and Prenter (1903‚Äì1925)= Time Magazine cover from 10 March 1924 featuring upright Before dying, Youngson recommended Warren Stanford Stone as his successor, a man who would have great influence in labor politics. Stone headed the union until 1924. Stone believed that if a worker \\"wants to join a union, all right, but it is contrary to the principles of free government and the Constitution of the United States . . . to make him join. Stone and other members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers became owners of the Coal River Collieries, and Stone became chairman of the board of directors of the mine. A dispute arose with John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. Lewis claimed that Stone was closing mines and throwing miners out of work rather than pay the union scale. Stone refuted this, saying the unions had not renewed their agreement, but the mines were being worked on a cooperative plan. He said \\"We feel sure there are no better satisfied men employed anywhere than in the Coal River Collieries.\\" Stone supported the radical Glenn E. Plumb plan for tripartite control of the railway industry by labor, capital and the public, and supported similar plans for other industries. In 1924 Stone was made president, with the grand chief engineer and two vice-presidents reporting to him. Stone died on 12 June 1925 of Bright's disease. At the time of Stone's death the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had majority interests in enterprises with assets of approximately $150,000,000. Stone was succeeded by William B. Prenter. Around this time it was found that the union's finances were in much poorer shape than had been thought, and the executives decided to undertake risky projects in an attempt to recoup the losses before the problem became public, including developing a resort in Florida. Through mismanagement, these projects ran into difficulty. The problems became visible to the delegates at the June 1927 convention, and Prenter was replaced by Alvanley Johnston =Johnston (1925‚Äì1950)= Johnston scrapped the president and vice-president titles and headed the union as grand chief engineer. In 1934 Johnston was convicted of mishandling the funds of the failed Standard Trust Bank of Cleveland. The bank was partly owned by the BLE and he was the chairman. Johnston's conviction was overturned on appeal on the grounds that he was not aware of what was being done. In 1943, during World War II (1939-1945), the government seized the railroads. Johnston and Alexander F. Whitney, head of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, were made labor consultants. Johnston also represented the railroad union of the Combined War Labor Board. Towards the end of 1945 Johnston and the leaders of the other main railroad unions demanded pay increases and a 40-hour work week from the railroads, in line with other industries. Negotiations stalled in January 1946. Three of the unions were willing to suspend their demands, but Johnston and Whitney called a strike of the engineers and trainmen to start on 16 March 1946. The strike was delayed when President Truman set up a board to hear the grievances and make recommendations. After lengthy negotiations, union members voted to go on strike on 23 May 1946. The strike stranded travelers, prevented movement of perishable goods and caused concern that many people in war-devastated Europe would starve if grain shipments were delayed. Truman broadcast an appeal to the strikers to return to work, and threatened to call out the army to end the strike. On 25 May the strikers accepted his terms. Johnston retired from the BLE in 1950. =Recent years= The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers was North America's oldest rail labor union when it merged with the Teamsters in 2004. The union sold its downtown Cleveland, Ohio, headquarters (the Standard Building) in July 2014. The union purchased new headquarters in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, Ohio, in March 2015. The union said it would move its headquarters to Independence when its lease at its old property ended in summer 2016.  Locomotive Engineers Mutual Life and Accident Insurance Association  1871 Life insurance policy The BLE had an insurance association, called the Locomotive Engineers Mutual Life and Accident Insurance Association. Founded in 1867, membership in the association was open to members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, their wives, widows, children and grandchildren, as well as \\"persons, their wives and eligible children who are represented under contracts for group insurance coverage between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the railroad industry.\\" Local units of the group were called branches and was governed by a quadrennial national convention. The association was headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio and had a membership of 30,000 in 1968 and 20,000 in 1979.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press pp.205-6 Leadership Dennis Pierce serves as the national president of the BLET and the president of the Teamsters Rail Conference.

Roscoff is renowned for its picturesque architecture, labelled \\"petite cit√© de caract√®re de Bretagne\\" (small town of character)City of Roscoff: Roscoff awarded \\"Petite cit√© de caract√®re de Bretagne\\" (small town of character) (in French) since 2009. Roscoff is also a traditional departure point for Onion Johnnies. After lobbying by local economic leaders headed by Alexis Gourvennec, the French government agreed in 1968 to provide a deep- water port at Roscoff. Existing ferry operators were reluctant to take on the relatively long Plymouth/Roscoff crossing, so Gourvennec and colleagues founded Brittany Ferries. Since the early 1970s, Roscoff has been developed as a ferry port for the transport of Breton agricultural produce, and for motor tourism. Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries link Roscoff with both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Due to the richness of iodine in the surrounding waters and the mild climate maintained by a sea current that only varies between , Roscoff is also a centre of post-cure which gave rise to the concept of thalassotherapy in the latter half of the 19th century. A French doctor, Louis-Eug√®ne Bagot, opened the Institut marin in Roscoff in 1899, the first centre for thalassotherapy in Europe. Since then many important centres of thalassotherapy such as the Institut de Rockroum (originally Institut marin), the clinic Kerl√©na, and a heliomarin hospital founded in 1900, the Perharidy Centre, can be found on the edges of the sea at Roscoff. The nearby √éle de Batz, called Enez Vaz in Breton, is a small island that can be reached by launch from the harbour.

Robert was born at Coleman in Coleman County, Texas, the son of Millard Franklin and Rowena Victoria (Lawrence) Arnold. Arnold received his musical training from southern shape note teachers such as Mr. & Mrs. J. H. Carr, W. W. Combs, L. A. Gordon, J. B. Herbert, John A. McClung, Will M. Ramsey, and Frank White. He traveled as a member of several quartets, including the Central Music Company Quartet. He also traveled extensively to teach about 300 shape note singing schools. In 1927, he joined Bill Bynum, Cecil MacDonald, and Bernie Horner to form the Overall Quartet. Sponsored by the J. C. Penney Company, the group wore pressed blue overalls, white shirts, and black bow ties at their concerts. In 1928, he married Cora Angie McDonald, whom he met at a gospel singing at Veribest (near San Angelo, Texas). They lived in Fort Worth, Kennedale and Jefferson, Texas, returning to Coleman in 1975. While in Fort Worth, he had a studio and taught piano and voice. He was the founder and owner of the National Music Company, which company published about fifty singing convention books. Before that he was a partner with Albert E. Brumley and W. Oliver Cooper in the Hartford National Company. Robert and Cora Arnold were members of the Church of Christ. Some of his more popular songs include Did You Repent, Fully Repent?, Have You Thought, Really Thought?, If I Could But Just Take One Soul To Heaven, and I Wanta Get Right. No Tears in Heaven, written in 1935, is probably his best known song. In addition to its popularity at shape note singings and inclusion in Stamps-Baxter's popular Heavenly Highway Hymns, No Tears in Heaven has been recorded by gospel quarters and artists such as Buck Owens, Skeeter Davis, Red Foley, and The Chuck Wagon Gang. Robert Sterling Arnold is a member of the 2005 Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductees. Arnold was inducted into the Texas Gospel Music Hall of Fame on September 14, 1985. He died in Coleman County at age 98 on February 8, 2003 and was buried in the Silver Valley Cemetery. References *Article by Robert S.

This statistic makes probabilistic statements about two models. They can be nested, non-nested or overlapping. The statistic tests the null hypothesis that the two models are equally close to the true data generating process, against the alternative that one model is closer. It cannot make any decision whether the \\"closer\\" model is the true model. With non-nested models and iid exogenous variables, model 1 (2) is preferred with significance level Œ±, if the z statistic :Z=\\\\frac{ \\\\operatorname{LR}_N(\\\\beta_{ML,1},\\\\beta_{ML,2})} {\\\\sqrt{N}\\\\omega_N} with : \\\\operatorname{LR}_N(\\\\beta_{ML,1},\\\\beta_{ML,2}) = L^1_N-L^2_N-\\\\frac{K_1-K_2} {2} \\\\log N exceeds the positive (falls below the negative) (1 ‚àí Œ±)-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Here K1 and K2 are the numbers of parameters in models 1 and 2 respectively. The numerator is the difference between the maximum likelihoods of the two models, corrected for the number of coefficients analogous to the BIC, the term in the denominator of the expression for Z, \\\\omega_N \\\\,, is defined by setting \\\\omega_N^2 equal to either the mean of the squares of the pointwise log- likelihood ratios \\\\ell_i\\\\,, or to the sample variance of these values, where :\\\\ell_i = \\\\log\\\\frac{f_1(y_i\\\\mid x_i,\\\\beta_{ML,1})}{f_2(y_i\\\\mid x_i,\\\\beta_{ML,2})}. For nested or overlapping models the statistic : 2\\\\operatorname{LR}_N(\\\\beta_{ML,1},\\\\beta_{ML,2})\\\\, has to be compared to critical values from a weighted sum of chi squared distributions. This can be approximated by a gamma distribution: :M_m(\\\\cdot,\\\\mathbf\\\\lambda)\\\\sim \\\\Gamma(b,p)\\\\, with : \\\\mathbf\\\\lambda=(\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\dots, \\\\lambda_m),\\\\, : m=K_1+K_2,\\\\ b=\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\frac {\\\\sum\\\\lambda_i} {\\\\sum\\\\lambda_i^2} and : p=\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\frac {\\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\lambda_i\\\\right)^2} {\\\\sum\\\\lambda_i^2}. \\\\mathbf\\\\lambda is a vector of eigenvalues of a matrix of conditional expectations. The computation is quite difficult, so that in the overlapping and nested case many authors only derive statements from a subjective evaluation of the Z statistic (is it subjectively \\"big enough\\" to accept my hypothesis?). Vuong's test for non-nested models has been used to compare a zero-inflated model to its non-zero-inflated counterpart.

He also discovered alkaptonuria, understanding its inheritance. He served as Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford from 1920 to 1927.Rolleston, J. D. (2004) \\"Garrod, Sir Archibald Edward (1857‚Äì1936)\\", rev. Alexander G. Bearn, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press.  Education and personal life  Brilliancy ran in Garrod's family. Archibald was the fourth son of Sir Alfred Baring Garrod, a renowned physician who received his medical degree at the age of 23 and became a professor of medicine at University College, London by the time he was 32. He discovered the abnormal uric acid metabolism associated with gout. Garrod's father also successfully estimated the weight of crystals he obtained from a known quantity of blood, resulting in what Garrod called ‚Äúthe first quantitative biochemical investigation made on the living human body‚Äù. Garrod's two older brothers also had successful careers. Charles Keene, a cousin, frequently visited Garrod's childhood home. Keene was an illustrator for the magazine Punch for over 40 years. Influenced by Keene, Garrod wrote an illustrated booklet called A Handbook of Classical Architecture. According to Krishna Dronamraju, Garrod displayed an interest in natural history from an early age and was particularly interested in butterflies. At the age of 12, he began collecting them and noted how few female butterflies were present, musing over possible inheritance patterns in mammals. He was educated at Marlborough College and Christ Church, University of Oxford. He performed poorly at Marlborough, struggling due to his lack of interest in classics, especially Latin prose and grammar. He graduated with a First-class Honours (or a \\"First\\") degree in natural science in 1878. In 1880, he received further medical training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where he obtained several scholarships including the competitive Brackenbury Scholarship. Garrod graduated in 1884 and then spent a year studying in Vienna at the general hospital, known as the Allgemeines Krankenhaus. His experiences in Vienna formed the basis for his 1886 work, An Introduction to the Use of the Laryngoscope, which was very well received. In 1885 he obtained his Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Arts from Oxford, and became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, London. He married Laura Elizabeth Smith in 1886. They had three sons and a daughter, Dorothy Garrod a British archaeologist who was the first woman to hold an Oxbridge chair, partly through her pioneering work on the Palaeolithic period. First World War During the First World War, Garrod served as medical consultant to the army, primarily in Malta and in 1918 was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in recognition of his wartime services.

Professional career  Over the next 20 years he served on the attending staff of several hospitals in London: Marylebone General Dispensary, West London Hospital, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, and Alexandra Hospital for Children with hip dysplasia. In 1892, he was appointed assistant physician at the Great Ormand Street Hospital. Dronamraju writes, ‚ÄúHe was interested in studies of normal and pathological urine, especially in differences of their coloration. It is of interest that his interest in butterflies and flowers in childhood was also related to color differences and biological variation, and it may well have helped to sharpen his perception in this regard.‚Äù Garrod was a proponent of scientific research as the foundation of medical practice, and published on a variety of diseases and topics throughout his career, including An Introduction to the Use of the Laryngoscope (1886) and A Treatise on Rheumatism and Rheumatoid Arthritis (1890). He helped found the Quarterly Journal of Medicine to provide a forum for more fundamental research into the processes of disease. He helped edit a pediatrics textbook, Diseases of Children (1913), with F.E. Batten and Hugh Thursfield. = Alkaptonuria and inborn errors of metabolism = Garrod is best known for his scientific study of inborn errors of metabolism. He developed an increasing interest in chemical pathology, and investigated urine chemistry as a reflection of systemic metabolism and disease. This research, combined with the new understanding of Mendelian inheritance, evolved from an investigation of a few families with an obscure and not very dangerous disease (alkaptonuria) to the realization that a whole territory of mysterious diseases might be understood as inherited disorders of metabolism. In the 1890s he collaborated with Frederick Gowland Hopkins, a well-known and respected London physician and biochemist who studied the concept of how vitamins, then known as ‚Äúaccessory factors‚Äù, effect dietary health of patients. Under Hopkins's influence and led by his own childhood fascination with color variations, he took particular notice of how the color of urine changed. In 1897, a mother arrived at the Great Ormand Street Hospital with an infant and a diaper stained brownish- black. Dr. Garrod recorded the family history of the baby and kept tabs on the newborn's growth over the years. He quickly began seeking other patients with the same disorder and found forty cases and read up on the disorder, the first instance of which was noted in 1822. In 1900, the same mother became pregnant. Once the baby was born, Garrod had nurses closely inspecting the baby's diaper. Sure enough, they noted the appearance of the black urine 52 hours after the baby was born. Garrod subsequently deduced that the condition, alkaptonuria, was innate. Looking at his records, Garrod noticed that alkaptonuria was more likely to occur in the children of first cousins. Working with William Bateson, Garrod came to understand the pattern of alkaptonuria appearance in children based on Mendelian principles. Once he applied Mendel's concepts to alkaptonuria, he published a paper in 1902 called ‚ÄúThe Incidence of Alkaptonuria: A Study of Chemical Individuality‚Äù. In the paper, Garrod explains how he came to understand the condition and speculates as to its causes. He cites various case studies and compares alkaptonuria to albinism in how it's inherited. In his paper, Garrod focuses on the concept of ‚Äúchemical individuality‚Äù without any prior knowledge of what would come to be known as genes. He writes, ‚ÄúOwing, as I believe, to their chemical individuality different human beings differ widely in their liability to individual maladies, and to some extent in the signs and symptoms which they exhibit‚Äù. Alkaptonuria is a rare familial disease of organic acid metabolism that is best known for the darkening of urine from yellow to brown to black after it is exposed to the air. In later life, individuals with this disease develop arthritis characterized by deposition of brown pigment in joint cartilage and connective tissue. Garrod studied the recurrence patterns in several families, realized it followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and postulated that it was caused by a mutation in a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a class of compounds called alkapton. He published The Incidence of Alkaptonuria: a Study in Chemical Individuality in 1902. Over the next decade he developed an understanding of the possible nature of inherited diseases of metabolism. He described the nature of recessive inheritance of most enzyme defects. In 1908, the core of this work was presented as the Croonian Lectures to the Royal College of Physicians, entitled Inborn Errors of Metabolism and published the following year. Garrod expanded his metabolic studies to cover cystinuria, pentosuria, and albinism. These three inborn errors, along with alkaptonuria are collectively called Garrod's tetrad. In 1923 he summarized these studies in an expanded edition of his best known work.  Honours  As it became clearer that he had pioneered a new field of medicine, Garrod was increasingly honored in England and abroad. He succeeded William Osler as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1910, was appointed to the Medical Research Council, and was made an honorary member of the American Association of Physicians, and of the √Ñrztlicher Verein in Munich. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen, Dublin, Glasgow, Malta, and Padua. In 1935 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine. The Canadian Association of Centres for the Management of Hereditary Metabolic Diseases is commonly referred to as the Garrod Association to honor his contributions to the field of inborn errors of metabolism. Death He died at the Cambridge home of his daughter after a brief illness in 1936, and is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London.

Life Born in Toronto, he was commissioned as a captain in the Canadian Army and became the conductor/arranger of the Canadian Band of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force sent overseas during World War II, which was the Canadian equivalent of the American Band of the SHAEF led by Major Glenn Miller. He was noted as a jazz trumpeter‚Äìhis longtime friend Dizzy Gillespie once stated that he was pleased that Farnon took up composing, arranging and conducting, because Robert was the better jazz trumpeter.David Ades, Robert Farnon biography , Robert Farnon Society, accessed 20 November 2010 He married Joanne Dallas, a singer from the SHAEF band, whom he later divorced. At the end of the war Farnon decided to make England his home, and he later moved to Guernsey in the Channel Islands with his new wife Patricia Smith and his five children. His friend and fellow composer Wally Stott composed \\"A Canadian in Mayfair\\" as a tribute. He was considered by his peers to be the finest arranger in the world, and his talents influenced many composer-arrangers, including Quincy Jones, all of whom acknowledged his contributions to their work. Conductor Andr√© Previn called him \\"the greatest writer for strings in the world.\\" He was the musical director and conductor for Tony Bennett's 1972 series for Thames Television, Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town. He won four Ivor Novello Awards, including one for \\"Outstanding Services to British Music\\" in 1991, and in 1996 he won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement for \\"Lament\\" performed by J. J. Johnson & his Robert Farnon Orchestra. He was also awarded the Order of Canada early in 1998. Robert Farnon died at the age of 87, at a hospice near his home of 40 years in Guernsey. He was survived by his wife Patricia and their five children, as well as two children from his previous marriage and his many grandchildren. Farnon's older brother Brian and his younger brother Dennis were also orchestral composers, arrangers and conductors. Works Farnon is probably best known for two famous pieces of light music, \\"Jumping Bean\\" and \\"Portrait of a Flirt\\", which were originally released in 1955 as the A and B sides on the same 78, and for \\"Westminster Waltz\\", and \\"A Star is Born\\". Farnon also wrote the music for more than forty motion pictures, including Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951), Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), Shalako (1968) and Bear Island (1979). He wrote the theme tune and other music for many, mostly British, television series including Colditz (1972‚Äì74), Secret Army (1977‚Äì79), Kessler (1981), and A Man Called Intrepid (1979). From the early 1960s, Farnon was a prominent orchestral arranger for vocalists. He arranged and conducted Frank Sinatra's only album recorded outside of the United States, Sinatra Sings Great Songs from Great Britain (1962), in London. Farnon also arranged and conducted Lena Horne's album Lena: A New Album (1976), Tony Bennett's Christmas album Snowfall (1968), and one of Sarah Vaughan's albums recorded in Denmark, Vaughan with Voices (1964). He also completed three full-length classical symphonies, a concerto for piano and orchestra called Cascades to the Sea, a rhapsody for violin and orchestra and a concerto for bassoon; he was commissioned to compose the test piece for the 1975 Brass Band Championships of Great Britain finals held at the Albert Hall and constructed Un Vie de Matelot (A Sailor's Life), a set of variations based on an original theme. The last piece he composed was entitled The Gaels: An American Wind Symphony, as a commission for the Roxbury High School band in honour of the school's mascot, the gael. The piece had its world premiere in May 2006. It was performed by the Roxbury High School Honors Wind Symphony under the direction of Dr. Stanley Saunders, a close friend of Farnon.

Early life Born in Brighton, Sussex, the youngest of three children, Mayle and his parents moved to Barbados in the aftermath of World War II, where his father was transferred as a Colonial Office employee. Mayle returned to England after leaving school at 16 in Barbados. Advertising career His first job in 1957 was as a trainee at Shell Oil, based in its London office. It was there that he discovered that he was more interested in advertising than oil and he wrote to David Ogilvy, the head of the advertising agency that had the Shell account at that time, asking for a job. Ogilvy offered him a job as a junior account executive, but Mayle's interest was more on the creative side of the business and he subsequently became a copywriter in 1961 based in its New York City office. In due course another agency, Papert Koenig, Lois, poached him from Ogilvy and sent him back to London to head up the creative team in its UK office, where one of his colleagues was Alan Parker. When the US parent hit trouble in the mid-1960s, he and a colleague bought the London operation. They developed the business with accounts that included Watneys, Olivetti, and Sony and after five years, it was bought by BBDO, one of the top American agencies. He then commuted between the U.S. and the UK as its creative director. A 1972 advertising slogan written by Mayle for Wonderloaf Bread was used as a football chant by supporters of Tottenham Hotspur, and became the basis of the song \\"Nice One Cyril\\". By 1974, Mayle had had enough of advertising and transatlantic commuting, and quit the business to write full-time. Author Mayle started off by writing educational books, including a series on sex education for children and young people. He also penned, in collaboration with illustrator Gray Jolliffe, a series of humorous books about the character Wicked Willie, based upon a personification of the male organ. He relocated from Devon to the Luberon, southern France, in the late 80s but his plans to write a novel were overtaken by an account of life in his new environment. This resulted in his 1989 book A Year in Provence which became an international bestseller, chronicling his first year as a British expatriate in M√©nerbes, a village in the southern d√©partement Vaucluse. Several more books followed, which have been translated in more than twenty languages. He also wrote for magazines and newspapers. A Year in Provence was subsequently produced as a TV series starring John Thaw and screened in 1993. The novel A Good Year was the basis for the 2006 film of the same name directed by Ridley Scott and starring actors Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard. Mayle relocated to Amagansett on Long Island, New York, to get away from fans and sightseers at his home in Provence. He subsequently returned to France and at the time of his death in 2018 resided in Vaugines, also situated in the Luberon, in Provence. He died in hospital near his home in January 2018. Awards British Book Awards named A Year in Provence Best Travel Book of the Year (1989) and him Author of the Year (1992).https://broadened- horizons.org/2011/11/30/living-the-good-life-about-peter-mayle/ The French government made him a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honor) in 2002, for coop√©ration et francophonie.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1999. In the episode, Homer discovers that a new television show, Police Cops, has a hero also named Homer Simpson. He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name, but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot, he is mocked and taunted, so he changes his name to \\"Max Power\\" to rid himself of the negative attention. Max gains new friends, and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down. In the end, he changes his name back to Homer Simpson. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. Since airing, it has received mixed reviews from television critics. Overall, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Plot The Simpson family watches the pilot episode of Police Cops, which follows a duo of suave and dashing detectives, Lance Kaufman and Homer Simpson. Homer is delighted with the positive attention he receives from townspeople for sharing the lead character's name, as well as the character's personality, despite the family telling him it is just a coincidence. Following the pilot, however, the Homer Simpson character is rewritten as Lance's overweight and inept comic relief sidekick who mistakes the toys for guns program as \\"guns for toys\\" and the police chief's insulin shipment for illegal drugs, resulting in Homer being mocked by the people of Springfield. Humiliated, he appeals to the producers to change the character back, but they refuse. Then, after unsuccessfully attempting to sue the company for improper usage of his old name, Homer legally changes his name to \\"Max Power\\". Though the negative attention fades away, Marge is unhappy that Max changed his name without consulting her. While shopping at Costington's, Max meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel. Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party, despite Marge's reservations, where they meet many famous people, but Max finds out the party is an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction. After travelling with the party guests to the forest, Max, Marge, and everyone else chain themselves to the trees to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down. The Springfield police arrive and Eddie and Lou chase Max around his tree, trying to \\"swab\\" him with mace. As Max rounds the tree, the chain cuts into it. The redwood falls and knocks down all other redwoods, angering their newfound friends. Max later changes his name back to \\"Homer Simpson\\". Production The show's writers had read a story in the newspaper about people with famous names and came up with a way of how Homer's life could be affected if he saw someone on TV with his name. While creating the Homer Simpson television character, the production staff was deciding if the character should be \\"cool\\" throughout the episode, or if he should be an idiot from the beginning. The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program. The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen. Ron Hauge, a The Simpsons show producer, suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name. His friend, however, did not take it. The episode would also inspire Tom Martin's cousin to name his son Max Power. One scene from the episode features Ned Flanders commenting that cartoons are easily able to change voice actors; to enhance the joke for his one line of dialogue, Flanders is voiced by recurring cast member Karl Wiedergott instead of his regular voice actor Harry Shearer. Cultural references The TV show Police Cops is a parody of the television series Miami Vice. One of the new TV shows features Archie Bunker in the show All in the Family 1999. Homer suggests the names Hercules Rockefeller, Rembrandt Q. Einstein, and Handsome B. Wonderful to Judge Snyder for his name change. The \\"Max Power\\" song is sung to the melody of \\"Goldfinger\\", the theme from the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964). Actors Woody Harrelson and Ed Begley Jr., President Bill Clinton and producers Lorne Michaels, Brian Grazer and Jerry Bruckheimer are shown in attendance at the party (Grazer's appearance is identical to his guest-voice appearance as himself from \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\", while Bruckheimer, who has not done a voice cameo for the show, is the thin man with a beard standing next to Grazer and wearing a bright sportcoat over a plain T-shirt). The police attempting to \\"swab\\" the protestors is a reference to several incidents in 1997 in which sheriff's deputies of Humboldt County, California, swabbed pepper spray in the eyes of environmental protesters. Actor Jeremy Piven is mentioned by Homer in this episode who asks the producers of Police Cops \\"Who's Jeremy Piven?\\" to which they reply \\"We don't know\\". Reception \\"Homer to the Max\\" finished 39th in the weekly ratings for the week of Feb 1‚Äì7, 1999, with a Nielsen rating of 8.5. Since airing, this episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that though it was \\"funny in all the right places, this is an episode of two distinct stories, neither of which mesh together. The whole Ed Begley, Jr. saving the forest bit seems to have been tacked on, as if the stuff about Homer finding his name being abused (shades of Mr. Sparkle again?) ran out of steam. Not a bad show, more a sort of 'So what?' show.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating, commenting that \\"it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines\\", but overall \\"the storyline didn't really have anywhere to go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time.\\" Morgan Larrick of About.com noted \\"Homer to the Max\\" as \\"one of the most unforgettable episodes\\" when reviewing the complete tenth season.

It is down the line from and measured from London Liverpool Street; it is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is TRM. It was opened by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1891 and built to a design by the company's chief architect, W. N. Ashbee; it was one of only two stations outside Essex to be built in the New Essex, or Ashbee, style.Trimley Station Community Trust: History, accessed 31 August 2015 A branch line for goods trains to the port of Felixstowe was opened at Trimley in 1987. Today it is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all passenger trains that call. History The Felixstowe Railway and Pier Company opened their line from to 1 May 1877 but the nearest station, other than at the pier near Landguard Common, was at Nacton; a station at was soon added but this was on the far side of the town so of little use to people in the Trimleys. On 1 May 1891 that the station at Trimley was opened, by which time the railway had been purchased by the GER and trains were running through from Ipswich where connections were better than at Westerfield. In 1898 a new Felixstowe Town was opened which was more convenient for people travelling to the town. Public freight facilities were withdrawn on 13 July 1964, although they were retained at Felixstowe until 5 December 1966. In 1967 the branch was converted to \\"Pay Train\\" operation, with all fares being collected by the guard so that the only staff left at Trimley were the signalmen. A new direct line to Felixstowe docks was opened in 1970, with Felixstowe Beach Junction created between Trimley and Felixstowe. At the same time the signal box at Felixstowe was closed, the electric signals and new junction being operated from Trimley. Work on a new line from the east end of Trimley station to the Northern Freightliner Terminal at Felixstowe docks started in March 1986 and it was opened for traffic on 16 February 1987. It involved heavy earthworks and cost ¬£2,000,000 but the dock owners received a 40% grant under Section 8 of the Railways Act 1974 as it would reduce road traffic. As part of this work the signal box was closed and a modular building provided instead. This was west of the level crossing on the south side of the line. In 1997 this signal box was closed, control of the branch being transferred to Colchester Panel Signal Box. Colour light signals and motor- driven points are fitted throughout, while the level crossing is monitored by CCTV. A signal passed at danger (SPAD) indicator was installed on the platform to act as a warning to train drivers approaching from Felixstowe should they pass a red signal. From May 2019 the infrastructure layout at Trimley was altered in connection with the partial doubling of the line towards Ipswich to accommodate more freight traffic. This meant trains from the Felixstowe direction could access the disused platform line (although this was not re- opened) and then two tracks extended westward for just over a mile to Gun Lane Junction. Both lines are bi-directionally signalled. Description A train to Felixstowe North runs through what used to be the westbound paltform The railway to Felixstowe was built with just a single track, but when Trimley station was built a second track was laid to allow trains to pass in the station. A platform was built for each track. The northern one (used by trains to Felixstowe) is nearer the village and so was provided with a single-storey building, also a small goods lock-up and a house for the station master. Two goods sidings were laid behind this platform. The southern platform (for trains to Ipswich) was provided with a waiting room and the signal box was built here, at the eastern end opposite the points for the goods sidings. People reach the station from the village along Cordy's Lane, which has a level crossing over the railway at the west end of the platforms. The loop was severed at the eastern end in 1987 in order to provide a connection to the new line to Felixstowe North Freightliner Terminal. Because of this the westbound platform was taken out of use and passenger trains in both directions now use the northern platform. Services A train bound for Ipswich , the typical Monday-Saturday off-peak service at Trimley is one train per hour in each direction between and . Trains are operated by Greater Anglia, and are typically Class 755. Proposed developments In 2009 Network Rail proposed to demolish the empty station building. A 'Friends of Trimley Station' group was formed and Network Rail agreed that they would leave it standing if a viable use was found for it. Suffolk Coastal District Council asked the local residents and found that there was a demand for a community meeting place and an internet caf√©. In 2011 Network Rail offered the Friends a two-year lease to allow them time to waterproof the building and secure the funding necessary to create a meeting room and caf√©. If successful they would then grant a long- term lease. By the end of the year the Friends had succeeded in establishing a limited company, Trimley Station Community Trust, to take on the lease.

Burton's military career began in the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, where he rose to the rank of Major, serving under George Augustus Eliott, the defender of Gibraltar. In 1754, Burton was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 48th Foot, which was involved in the captures of Quebec in 1759 and Martinique and Havanna in 1762. In 1760, General Jeffery Amherst, Governor General of British North America, appointed him lieutenant governor of the Trois-Rivi√®res district while New France remained under British military rule. On 31 January 1761 Burton formed the 95th Regiment of Foot in South Carolina from several independent companies. The regiment fought successfully against the Cherokees. It then transferred to Barbados. From there it participated in the capture of Martinique, the occupation of Grenada, and the siege of Havana (1762). The regiment was disbanded in England on 7 March 1763. Following the return of civilian rule under the newly appointed Governor, General James Murray, Burton was made brigadier (commander) of the army in the new British province of Quebec. He was also made Colonel of the 3rd Foot (the Buffs). After continual conflict with Governor Murray, both he and Burton were recalled to Britain in 1766. Despite being an influential figure in Canadian military and geopolitical history, little is known about Burton's life outside of the Army. He appears to have been a close friend of John Calcraft, and was elected to Parliament a few months before his death as Member for Wareham, a pocket borough that Calcraft controlled. He died in 1768. A 1767 will mentions an estate in Yorkshire, England and a townhouse in London. He was twice married: in 1750 to Elizabeth St Leger (died 1753), sister of Anthony St Leger after whom the famous horse race is named, then around 1763 to Marguerite Lydius; he had a son and a daughter by this second marriage. A daughter Mary, his eventual heir, married General Napier Christie, who adopted the surname Burton.

For more than two decades, Foley was one of the biggest stars of the genre, selling more than 25 million records. His 1951 hit, \\"Peace in the Valley\\", was among the first million- selling gospel records. A Grand Ole Opry veteran until his death, Foley also hosted the first popular country music series on network television, Ozark Jubilee, from 1955 to 1960. He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, which called him \\"one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time\\" and \\"a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music.\\" Biography Foley was born June 17, 1910 on a farm in Blue Lick, Kentucky, grew up in nearby Berea, and gained the nickname Red for his hair color. He was born into a musical family, and by the time he was nine was giving impromptu concerts at his father's general store, playing French harp, piano, banjo, trombone, harmonica and guitar. At 17, he won first prize in a statewide talent show. He graduated from Berea High School, and later worked as a $2-a-show usher and singer at a theater in Covington, Kentucky. =Early radio and recording career= In 1930, as a freshman at Georgetown College, Foley was chosen by a talent scout from Chicago's WLS-AM to sing with producer John Lair's Cumberland Ridge Runners, the house band on National Barn Dance. His first single, \\"Life is Good Enough for Me / The Lone Cowboy\\", was released in June 1933 on the Melotone label. In 1937 he returned to Kentucky with Lair to help establish the Renfro Valley Barn Dance stage and radio show near Mt. Vernon in 1939, performing everything from ballads to boogie-woogie to blues. In late 1939, Foley became the first country artist to host a network radio program, NBC's Avalon Time (co-hosted by Red Skelton), and he performed extensively at theaters, clubs and fairs. He then returned for another seven- year stint with National Barn Dance. In 1941, the same year he made his first of only two film appearances (portraying himself) with Tex Ritter in the Western, The Pioneers, Foley signed a lifetime contract with Decca Records. He also released \\"Old Shep\\" in 1941, a song he wrote with Arthur Willis in 1933 about a dog he owned as a boy (in reality, his German shepherd, poisoned by a neighbor, was named Hoover). The song, later recorded by many artists including Hank Snow and Elvis Presley, became a country classic. His patriotic 1944 single, \\"Smoke on the Water\\", topped the folk records chart for 13 consecutive weeks, and on January 17, 1945, Foley was the first country performer to record in Nashville, Tennessee. During the session at WSM-AM's Studio B, he recorded \\"Tennessee Saturday Night\\", \\"Blues in the Heart\\" and \\"Tennessee Border\\". He soon became known for such songs as \\"The Death of Floyd Collins\\" and \\"The Sinking of the Titanic\\".The Associated Press (September 21, 1968) \\"Red Foley Dead; Country Singer\\", The New York Times, p. 33 He moved to Nashville in 1946 and was briefly a member of the Brown's Ferry Four, recording \\"Jesus Hold My Hand\\" and \\"I'll Meet You in the Morning\\". =Mr. Country Music= In April 1946, Foley signed on to emcee and perform on The Prince Albert Show, the segment of the Grand Ole Opry carried on NBC Radio. During the next eight years he established himself as one of the most respected and versatile performers in country music. He acted as master of ceremonies, the straight man for Opry comedians Rod Brasfield and Minnie Pearl, and proved himself a vocalist who could handle all types of material. His popularity was credited with establishing the Opry as America's top country music radio show. In 1949, Foley was part of the Opry's first European tour, visiting U.S. military bases in England, West Germany and the Azores, with Brasfield, Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl, Little Jimmy Dickens, Hank Williams and others. Foley began recording with his backing group, the Cumberland Valley Boys, in 1947. He recorded seven top five hits with the group between 1947 and 1949, including a No. 1 single, \\"New Jolie Blonde (New Pretty Blonde)\\" (a cover of a 1946 Moon Mullican hit), and the country boogie anthem \\"Tennessee Saturday Night\\", a chart-topper in 1948. In 1950, he had three million-sellers: \\"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\\", \\"Steal Away\\" (recorded by Hank Williams as \\"The Funeral\\"), and a solo version of the song that became his trademark, \\"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\\". Featuring guitarist Grady Martin, it stayed at No. 1 on Billboard's country chart for 13 weeks and hit the pop chart as well. In April 1951, Foley was pleased when the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville to join him for a two-day recording session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with Burl Ives in 1947 and Ernest Tubb in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well- executed and received a good deal of play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic \\"Satins and Lace,\\" the rockabilly-flavored novelty \\"Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?,\\" a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic \\"Bury Me Beneath the Willow,\\" two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: \\"It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)\\" and \\"He Bought My Soul at Calvary.\\"Sforza, John: \\"Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;\\" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages In 1951, Foley's second wife, Judy Martin, took her own life. To devote more time to his family in Nashville, he cut back on performing but continued to release hits in a variety of styles, including rockabilly and rhythm and blues. His 1951 hit, \\"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (for Me)\\" backed by the Sunshine Boys quartet, was one of the first gospel music records to sell one million copies. He also released his first LP that year, Souvenir Album (Decca DL-5303). Foley's manager was Jim McConnell and \\"Dub\\" Albritton was his personal appearances manager. Starting in 1951, he hosted The Red Foley Show on Saturday afternoons on NBC Radio from Nashville (moving to ABC Radio and Springfield, Missouri from 1956 to 1961) sponsored by Dow Chemical. On November 21, 1953, he was one of the first eight singers named to Billboard magazine's Honor Roll of Country and Western artists, \\"named by the disk jockeys of America as an all-time great of country & western music.\\"\\"Honor Roll of C&W; Artists\\" (December 5, 1953) The Billboard, p. 48 Foley never lost his love for country music and, unlike Eddy Arnold, never sought success as a pop artist, even though many of his recordings made the pop charts. Other hits included \\"Sugarfoot Rag\\", \\"Cincinnati Dancing Pig\\" and \\"Birmingham Bounce\\", which stayed at No. 1 for 14 weeks. Foley's success with the song prompted 21 cover versions. \\"One By One\\", a duet with Kitty Wells, hit No. 1 in 1954 and stayed on the charts for 41 weeks. He also recorded with Ernest Tubb (with whom he maintained a fictitious on-air \\"feud\\"), the Dixie Dons, the Anita Kerr Singers, Rosetta Tharpe, Evelyn Knight and the Lawrence Welk Orchestra. Known by then as Mr. Country Music and America's Favorite Country Gentleman, critics dubbed him the \\"barnyard Bing Crosby.\\"Dessauer, Phil \\"Springfield, Mo.-Radio City of Country Music\\" (April 1957), Coronet, p. 154 =Television career= Foley in Springfield, Missouri, ca. 1956After several years in virtual retirement, Foley moved to Springfield, Missouri in July 1954 after music executive Si Siman convinced him to host Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV and radio.

The Jubilee ran for nearly six years and further cemented Foley's fame, but was canceled partly because of federal income tax evasion charges pending against him in 1960. His first trial that fall ended with a hung jury, but on April 23, 1961, he was quickly acquitted.\\"Foley Acquitted of Tax Evasion\\" (April 23, 1961), Springfield Leader & Press, p.

In 1963, he returned to Nashville and performed and toured with the Grand Ole Opry. He appeared in the 1966 film musical, Sing a Song, for Heaven's Sake, and was a guest on The Joey Bishop Show on August 24, 1967. Foley was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1967 (the first Kentuckian and one of only six then-living inductees), which honored him as \\"one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time\\" and \\"a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music and today a timeless legend.\\" =Death= On September 19, 1968, Foley appeared in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, sponsored by the local Sheriff's Posse\\"Red Foley, a Country Great, is Found Dead\\" September 1968 Billboard that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Williams Jr. noted that Foley was somewhat slower than usual that day and had no appetite. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, \\"Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?\\" He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I looked him in the face and said, \\"Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you.\\" I prayed with Red. He went out, and the last song he sang was \\"Peace in the Valley.\\" He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) \\"I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away\\"). According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, \\"I'm awful tired now, Hank. I've got to go to bed.\\" Foley had sung \\"Peace in the Valley\\" at Hank Sr.'s funeral. Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville. Family Foley had an older brother, Clarence \\"Cotton\\" Foley (1903‚Äì1988), who in 1939, along with brother Red, John Lair, and Whitey Ford, co-founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance in Rockcastle County, Kentucky. Foley's first wife was Axie Pauline Cox, who died giving birth to their daughter Betty. Betty (1933‚Äì1990) married Bentley Cummins in 1948 and had three children: Clyde Foley Cummins, a country music performer; Charlotte Jean; and Patrick Bentley. On August 9, 1933, Foley married his second wife, Eva Alaine Overstake. Known during her solo career as Judy Martin, she was one of the Three Little Maids on National Barn Dance and a sister of country music songwriter Jenny Lou Carson. Red and Eva had three daughters: Shirley Lee (Boone), Julie Ann (Neely), and Jenny Lou (Pankratz), who recorded with their parents on Decca as the Little Foleys. Shirley Lee Foley married actor-singer Pat Boone in 1953. Their daughters are Cherry Boone, Linda Lee, Laura Gene and country and Christian music singer Debby Boone. She died in 2019. On November 17, 1951, Eva Foley committed suicide.

B9 Legacy Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style. Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10, 2003, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea. In 2002, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006, his 1951 version of \\"Peace in the Valley\\" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. In 1970, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley's career, such as folk, country, bluegrass, gospel and popular music. A dance to Foley's recording of \\"Papa\\" John Gordy's song, The Salty Dog Rag, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972, where it is taught to freshmen during orientation.Dartmouth Class of 2010: Traditions Cumberland Falls State Park, in Corbin, Kentucky, near Foley's hometown of Berea, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s. The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say, \\"Red Foley was a great country music singer, too bad no one will ever remember him.\\" The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since. Foley Middle School, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family. Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa, Missouri, named for performers on Ozark Jubilee, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County, Kentucky, north of Renfro Valley. In 2009, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin), entitled . dedicated to Red Foley's wife Eva Overstake. The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi. His grandson Clyde Foley Cummins is in the music industry as well. He plays numerous instruments and has played in several benefits over the years. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Red Foley among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

History 1968-1971 Colosseum, one of the first bands to fuse jazz, rock & blues, were formed in Spring 1968 by drummer Jon Hiseman with tenor sax player Dick Heckstall-Smith, who had previously worked together in the New Jazz Orchestra and in The Graham Bond Organisation, where Hiseman had replaced Ginger Baker in 1966. They met up again early in 1968 when they both played in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, during which time they played on the Bare Wires album. Childhood friend Dave Greenslade was quickly recruited on organ, as was bass player Tony Reeves who had also known both Hiseman and Greenslade since being teenage musicians in South East London. The band's line-up was completed, after lengthy auditions, by Jim Roche on guitar and James Litherland (guitar & vocals), although Roche only recorded one track before departing. Their first album, Those Who Are About to Die Salute You, which opened with the Bond composition \\"Walkin' in the Park\\", was released by the Philips' Fontana label in early 1969. In March the same year they were invited to take part in Supershow, a two-day filmed jam session, along with Modern Jazz Quartet, Led Zeppelin, Jack Bruce, Roland Kirk Quartet, Eric Clapton, Stephen Stills, and Juicy Lucy. Colosseum's second album, later in 1969, was Valentyne Suite,Ben Miler, Colosseum: Valentyne Suite (1969) , Hippy.com , 14 October 2002. notable as the first release on Philip's newly launched Vertigo label, established to sign and develop artists that did not fit the main Philips' brand, and the first label to sign heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath. For the third album, The Grass Is Greener, released only in the United States in 1970, Dave \\"Clem\\" Clempson replaced James Litherland. Louis Cennamo then briefly replaced Tony Reeves on bass, but was replaced in turn by Mark Clarke within a month. Then Hiseman recruited vocalist Chris Farlowe to enable Clempson to concentrate on guitar. This lineup had already partly recorded the 1970 album Daughter of Time. In March 1971, the band recorded concerts at the Big Apple Club in Brighton and at Manchester University. Hiseman was impressed with the atmosphere at the Manchester show, and the band returned five days later for a free concert that was also recorded. The recordings were released as a live double album Colosseum Live in 1971. In October 1971 the original band broke up. Interim 1971‚Äì1994 After the band split, Jon Hiseman formed Tempest with bassist Mark Clarke; Dave Greenslade formed Greenslade together with Tony Reeves. Chris Farlowe joined Atomic Rooster; and Dick Heckstall-Smith embarked on a solo career. Clem Clempson joined the hit group Humble Pie. Hiseman formed another group called Colosseum II in 1975, with a stronger orientation towards jazz-fusion rock, which featured guitarist Gary Moore and Don Airey on keyboards. They released three albums before disbanding in 1978. Reunion 1994‚Äì2015  Colosseum reunited in 1994 with the same line-up as when they split in 1971. Colosseum reunited on 24 June 1994 at the Freiburg Zelt Musik Festival, then, a few months later, they played a concert in Cologne on 28 October at E-Werk which was recorded for a TV Special and later released in 1995 as a CD and video. It was then re-released in 2004 as a DVD. The rejuvenated band then played a lengthy tour of mainly German concerts. A second tour followed in 1997, to promote their new studio album \\"Bread and Circuses\\". They also appeared at major festivals in 1998, 1999 and 2000. In 2003 they toured on the back of \\"Tomorrow's Blues\\" CD, followed also by gigs in England in 2004. Hiseman's wife, saxophonist Barbara Thompson, joined the band on various occasions before the death of Dick Heckstall-Smith in December 2004, before becoming a permanent member of the band. In 2005, there were three memorial concerts for Dick Heckstall-Smith, one in Hamburg Germany and two in England. Then on 24 September 2005 they performed in Moscow, followed by more concerts in 2006. In 2007, the made their first appearance in Japan and returned to play more dates in Germany. Further tours of Europe were made in 2010. In October 2010, Jon Hiseman's biography, Playing the Band - The Musical Life of Jon Hiseman, was published. In November 2012, a Kindle version (with minor re-edits) of Playing the Band was published. Colosseum played their \\"Summer 2011\\" tour of 22 gigs in Germany, Italy, Austria, Finland and Poland. The tour started in June and ended on 20 August in Germany, Rostock, at Bad Doberan \\"Zappanale\\" festival. According to the interview of the bandleader Jon Hiseman, Bad Doberan was the last concert of the band. Their second 'last' concert was in Poland, Slupsk, at \\"Legends of Rock\\" festival on 13 August 2011 and the third 'last' concert in Finland, √Ñ√§nekoski, at \\"Keitelejazz\\" festival on the 23 July 2011. These announcements were based on Barbara's worsening Parkinson's condition preventing her from playing. However, with the arrival of new medication, her ability to play was renewed, so those announcements proved to be premature and the band continued to record and play until 2015. More studio releases followed, as expanded editions of Valentyne Suite and Colosseum Live, and several compilation sets of earlier work. From 2011 to 2014, Colosseum gradually recorded their final album, titled \\"Time on our Side\\", which was eventually released late in 2014, to coincide with their final flurry of dates in Germany and the UK. These included 24 concerts during 2014 in Central Europe, starting 23 October at Steinegg Festival, Collepietra, Italy. Followed by concerts in February 2015 before ending on 28 of that month at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, London. At all these concerts, Jon Hiseman confirmed from the stage that this tour would be Colosseum's last. After 23 years, the band played what Jon referred to as 'the last hurrah!' before a packed and very appreciative audience at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, London on 28 February 2015. Special 'guest' was Ana Gracey, the daughter of Jon Hiseman and Barbara Thompson, who sang her own composition, \\"Blues to Music\\", with Chris Farlowe, which was also included on the final Colosseum CD. Second Reunion 2020‚Äì  Colosseum reunited again after the death of Jon Hiseman to play selected shows in 2020. The line-up is Chris Farlowe, Clem Clempson and Mark Clarke joined by Kim Nishikawara (sax), Adrian Askew (keys, organ) and Malcolm Mortimore (drums). Material loss 2019 On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Colosseum among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It was designed by Schultze and Weaver and was built in 1926 by John McEntee Bowman and George Merrick as part of the Biltmore hotel chain. The tower is inspired by the Giralda, the medieval tower of the cathedral of Seville. When completed it became the tallest building in Florida at holding the record until 1928 when the Dade County Courthouse was built. At one time the pool was the largest pool in the world and among the many attractions was swimming instructor (and later Tarzan actor) Johnny Weissmuller.Greg Jenkins Florida's Ghostly Legends and Haunted Folklore: South and central Florida, Volume 1 page 22 It served as a hospital during World War II and as a VA Hospital and campus of the University of Miami medical school until 1968. Abandoned for many years it became a hotel again in 1987. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. History In 1925 land developer George E. Merrick joined forces with Biltmore hotel magnate John McEntee Bowman at the height of the Florida land boom to build \\"a great hotel...which would not only serve as a hostelry to the crowds which were thronging to Coral Gables but also would serve as a center of sports and fashion.\\" In January 1926, ten months and $10 million later, the hotel debuted with a magnificent inaugural that brought people down from northern cities on trains marked \\"Miami Biltmore Specials.\\" Visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Al Capone, and assorted Roosevelts and Vanderbilts as frequent guests. Franklin D. Roosevelt had a temporary White House office set up at the Hotel when he vacationed in Miami. There were many gala balls and aquatic shows by the grand pool; it was an elegant venue for weddings and world-class golf tournaments. Just months after the hotel opened, on September 18, the 1926 Miami Hurricane struck. While the hotel was undamaged, and actually provided shelter for over 2000 survivors, the disaster signaled the end of the Florida land boom. Merrick's Coral Gables company declared bankruptcy on April 13, 1929, and Merrick's stake in the hotel was bought out by his partner, John McEntee Bowman in November 1929 for $2.1 million. Bowman resold the hotel in September 1931 to millionaire Henry Latham Doherty. The hotel made it through the early 1930s by hosting aquatic galas. As many as 3,000 would come out on a Sunday afternoon to watch the synchronized swimmers, bathing beauties and alligator wrestling. Johnny Weissmuller, before he became known as the actor that played Tarzan, broke a world record at the pool. With the onset of World War II, the War Department took over the hotel, converting it to a 1200-bed hospital in November 1942. The building was transferred to the Army in 1946 and renamed Pratt General Hospital. Many of the windows were sealed with concrete, and the marble floors covered with government-issue linoleum. The hospital was transferred from the Army to the Veterans Administration (VA) in July 1947. Also the early site of The University of Miami's School of Medicine, Pratt General Hospital remained a VA hospital, with 450 beds, until a newer facility opened nearby in May 1968 and the building was vacated. In 1973, through the Historic Monuments Act and Legacy of Parks program, the City of Coral Gables was granted ownership control. The building remained unoccupied for almost 10 years. Then in 1983, the City oversaw its full restoration to be opened as a grand hotel. It was reopened on December 31, 1987 as a first class hotel and resort. In June 1992, a multinational consortium led by Seaway Hotels Corporation became the new operators of the hotel under a long term management lease with the City of Coral Gables, and again made significant refurbishments to the property. New lighting and telephone systems, repairs to the pool, furnishings, a complete guestroom renovation program and spa were completed. In February 2009 the hotel opened a Culinary Academy. The Biltmore Culinary Academy is a recreational hands-on cooking school with classes for adults and children taught by the hotel's chefs. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of Florida Architecture, 100 Years, 100 Places. The hotel is on a list of supposedly haunted locations. Mobster Thomas Walsh was killed while staying at the hotel in 1929. The hotel has been used as a setting in various movies and television programs such as Bad Boys, The Specialist, Shock Waves, CSI: Miami, Popi and Miami Vice. Golf The hotel has an 18-hole, par 71, championship course designed by Donald Ross. Reopened in November, 2007 following a $5 million investment, the course was restored and updated by Brian Silva. The original 1925 routing was retained, but all greens, tees and bunkers were reconstructed and grassed to contemporary standards. The property again contracted Silva to provide additional improvements to the golf course in the summer of 2018. Spa The hotel has a full service spa which is a member of the Leading Spas of the World.

Traditional cashew chicken The traditional version of cashew chicken is stir-fried in a wok. Tender chunks of chicken are combined with crispy roasted cashews, vegetables and are tossed in a light sauce made from garlic, soy sauce and hoisin sauce, thinned with water. Springfield-style cashew chicken The deep-fried version of the dish is closely associated with the city of Springfield, Missouri. Deep-fried cashew chicken was apparently first served in 1963 at the Grove Supper Club in Springfield. David Leong (1920-2020), a chef who moved to the United States from China in 1940, struggled to gain acceptance for the foods of his homeland so he began searching for a dish that would appeal to local residents' tastes. His famous deep-fried cashew chicken recipe was so popular he soon opened Leong's Tea House in Springfield. The dish became exceedingly popular in the Springfield area and is often cited as the unofficial \\"dish of the city\\". Springfield even hosts an annual festival that is centered on this chicken dish: Springfield Sertoma's Cashew Craze. A plate of Springfield-style (deep fried) cashew chicken served with fried rice and an egg roll. Borrowing from the local love of fried chicken, Leong came up with a variation of the preexisting dish. Instead of stir-frying the chicken, as is normally done, he deep-fried the chicken chunks. He then covered them with the typical sauce made from chicken stock, soy sauce and oyster sauce, and added the handful of cashews. He also included chopped green onions as a twist and it became an immediate hit with the local crowd. As word spread about the dish, so did the recipe. Leong's Tea House closed its doors in 1997, but Springfield-style cashew chicken is still being served at over 70 Chinese restaurants, as well as many non-Chinese restaurants, in and around the Springfield metropolitan area, and elsewhere in Missouri and other states. Springfield-style cashew chicken has been mentioned on The Food Channel, a nationwide syndicated radio program, and the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2010, Leong's son, with his father's assistance, opened a new restaurant in Springfield serving the same style of cashew chicken. Leong died at the age of 99 on July 21, 2020.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 27, 1998. In the episode, Bart accidentally kills a mother bird with a BB gun, and decides to hatch and take care of the two eggs he found in the bird's nest. \\"Bart the Mother\\" was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore; it was the last full-length episode Cohen wrote for The Simpsons before leaving to work on Futurama. The original idea for the episode was intended to be a B story, but because it was too difficult to work into other episodes, it eventually became a primary plot. The episode features the final speaking appearance of character Troy McClure and was dedicated to the character's voice actor, Phil Hartman, who was murdered by his wife on May 28, 1998, four months before the episode aired. In its original American broadcast, \\"Bart the Mother\\" finished 58th in ratings for the week of September 21‚Äì27, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.4, translating to 7,355,600 households. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Bart's moral dilemma and soul searching moments. Nancy Cartwright, the voice actress of Bart, described the episode as one of her favorites. Plot When Marge takes the family to the Family Fun Center, she notices Nelson intentionally knocking Milhouse off a racetrack and winning a BB gun from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson attempt to be friends but Marge forbids Bart to be with Nelson. Bart goes to his house anyway to use his BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills it. Marge learns where he went, goes to Nelson's house and is furious after seeing what he did but instead of punishing him, she refuses to have anything to do with his destructive ways and leaves. Bart discovers two eggs in the bird's nest and not wanting the babies to die too, decides to hatch them, secretly keeping the eggs warm in his treehouse. Marge gets suspicious after noticing him spending more time in his treehouse but forgives him after finding out what he has been doing. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch but the Simpson family is shocked when a pair of lizards emerge from them, whom Bart had already named Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr. Bart and Marge take the lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society, where Principal Skinner, explains they are Bolivian tree lizards, a breed that steals a bird's eggs and leaves their own to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. As Skinner wonders how their mother ended up in Springfield, the audience gets a flashback from a nervous Apu's perspective, revealing that a pair of the lizards had come with his shipment of Bolivian donuts and escaped his store while he was putting them on the shelf. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but Skinner catches up to him and they struggle on top of the society building. The lizards fall off the side but to everyone's disbelief, glide to the ground. The lizards grow in population and start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield. Since the town considered the pigeons a nuisance, they are delighted and Bart is thanked and honored by Mayor Quimby with a loganberry scented candle. Lisa worries the town will become infested by lizards but Skinner assures her they will send in Chinese needle snakes to eat them, followed by snake-eating gorillas, which will \\"simply freeze to death\\" when wintertime rolls around. Production alt=A closeup of a man in front of a microphone. He has a receding hairline and wears dark-framed glasses. \\"Bart the Mother\\" was the last full-length episode David X. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen teamed up with The Simpsons creator Matt Groening to develop Futurama, where he served as executive producer and head writer for the series' entire run. Cohen's idea for the episode started out as a B story for Homer. In the original concept, pigeons nest outside Homer's window at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Burns exterminates the pigeons and Homer climbs out onto the ledge of the window, in the middle of a blizzard, to nest the eggs. Cohen said the idea \\"[did not] fit in anywhere\\", so he decided to pitch it as an A story instead, with Bart nesting the eggs instead of Homer. The Simpsons writer George Meyer thought the idea of Bart shooting the bird and simply nesting the eggs was too straightforward, and he did not think it had \\"enough of a twist\\" to be a good episode. Cohen and Meyer eventually decided the eggs should be lizard eggs. Cohen thought the twist was what ultimately made the episode both \\"touching\\" and \\"interesting\\". Producer Ron Hauge came up with the idea of someone shooting a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was \\"far, far away\\". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was \\"dying inside\\". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled \\"Opie the Birdman\\". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to \\"liven up the visuals\\", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for season seven called \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode. Draco, seen here, served as inspiration for the Bolivian tree lizard in the episode.alt=A diagram of a gliding lizard The Family Fun Center the Simpsons visit is based on a real family fun center in Falmouth, Massachusetts that Cohen went to as a child to play video games. The Bolivian tree lizard is a fake species, but Cohen based it on real animals, including the dinosaur species Oviraptor, which was originally thought to eat eggs. The species is also based on the cowbird and the cuckoo, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and Draco, a genus of gliding lizards. Cohen also received inspiration from the cane toad that started \\"taking over\\" Australia in 1935. \\"Bart the Mother\\" marked the last guest appearance of Phil Hartman on The Simpsons as Troy McClure. On May 28, 1998, four months before the episode aired, he was shot and killed by his wife Brynn. \\"Bart the Mother\\" was dedicated in his memory in response to this. Rather than replace Hartman with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure from the show, along with Hartman's other recurring character, Lionel Hutz. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Bart the Mother\\" finished 58th in the ratings for the week of September 21‚Äì27, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.4, translating to 7,355,600 households. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, called it one of her favorite The Simpsons episodes, along with \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" and \\"Lisa's Substitute\\". The Toronto Suns Bruce Kirkland wrote that \\"Bart the Mother\\" was one of the \\"classic episodes\\" of the series' tenth season. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood wrote, \\"We particularly like the moral dilemma at the end, as underlined by Lisa, regarding the eventual culling of the lizards that will need to take place. A good romp, this one, with some nice laughs at Homer's expense.\\" Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, \\"The show generates decent heart as it shows Bart's attempts to make up for his misbehavior. The show becomes reasonably enjoyable if not especially memorable.\\" Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth season of The Simpsons the series' \\"first significant dip in quality, a step away from its golden era [...] with broader gags and more outlandish plots\\". However, Hassenger enjoyed \\"Bart the Mother\\", and wrote, \\"[The episode] explores the show's sweet and dark sides simultaneously as Bart, remorseful after killing a bird, tries to care for orphaned eggs that turn out to hold ravenous lizards.\\" DVD Town's James Plath described \\"Bart the Mother\\" as an episode that viewers would either love or hate, because of Bart's rare moments of soul searching, and he found the episode to be a memorable one.

Erected as a diocese around 250 by St. Sixtus, the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese around 750. The archbishop received the title \\"primate of Gallia Belgica\\" in 1089. In 1023, Archbishop Ebles acquired the Countship of Reims, making him a prince-bishop; it became a duchy and a peerage between 1060 and 1170. The archdiocese comprises the arrondissement of Reims and the d√©partement of Ardennes while the province comprises the r√©gion of Champagne-Ardenne. The suffragan dioceses in the ecclesiastical province of Reims are Amiens; Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis; Ch√¢lons; Langres; Soissons, Laon, and Saint-Quentin; and Troyes. The archepiscopal see is located in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims, where the Kings of France were traditionally crowned. In 2014 it was estimated that there was one priest for every 4,760 Catholics in the diocese. Pope Francis appointed √âric de Moulins-Beaufort Archbishop of Reims in 2018. History Reims was taken by the Vandals in 406. According to Flodoard, on Holy Saturday, 497, Clovis was baptized and anointed by Archbishop Remigius of Reims in the cathedral of Reims. In 719 the city took up arms against Charles Martel, who besieged the city, took it by assault, and devastated it. In 816, Pope Stephen IV crowned Louis the Pious as Emperor at Reims. On 28 January 893, Charles III \\"the Simple' was crowned King of West Francia at Reims.

He returned to Rome for the Conclave of 18 January‚Äì7 April 1655, where he played his part as Cardinal Camerlengo and French agent. The new Pope, Alexander VII (Chigi) named Barberini Bishop of Frascati (1655‚Äì1661). On 24 June 1657 Louis XIV named him Archbishop of Reims, but Barberini did not obtain his bulls during Alexander VII's lifetime because he was unwilling to resign the office of Camerlengo in favor of the Pope's nephew. He finally received his bulls from Pope Clement IX on 18 July 1667. Barberini took possession of the diocese of Reims on 4 October by proxy, took his oath to the King on 2 November, and made his solemn entry into his diocese on 22 December.

Following Google's corporate restructuring under the conglomerate Alphabet Inc. in October 2015, Alphabet took \\"Do the right thing\\" as its motto, also forming the opening of its corporate code of conduct. The original motto was retained in Google's code of conduct, now a subsidiary of Alphabet. In April 2018, the motto was removed from the code of conduct's preface and retained in its last sentence. History The motto was first suggested either by Google employee Paul Buchheit at a meeting about corporate values that took place in early 2000 (quoting from: Jessica Livingston, Founders at Work, ) or in 2001 or, according to another account, by Google engineer Amit Patel in 1999. Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, said he \\"wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out\\", adding that the slogan was \\"also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent\\". While the official corporate philosophy of Google does not contain the words \\"Don't be evil\\", they were included in the prospectus (on Form S-1) of Google's 2004 IPO (a letter from Google's founders, later called the \\"'Don't Be Evil' manifesto\\"): \\"Don't be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served‚Äîas shareholders and in all other ways‚Äîby a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.\\" The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as Do no evil. By early 2018, the motto was still cited in the preface to Google's Code of Conduct: > \\"Don't be evil.\\" Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our > users. But \\"Don't be evil\\" is much more than that... The Google Code of > Conduct is one of the ways we put \\"Don't be evil\\" into practice... Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface, leaving a mention in the final line: \\"And remember‚Ä¶ don't be evil, and if you see something that you think isn't right ‚Äì speak up!\\"  Interpretations  In their 2004 founders' letter prior to their initial public offering, Larry Page and Sergey Brin argued that their \\"Don't be evil\\" culture prohibited conflicts of interest, and required objectivity and an absence of bias: In 2009, Chris Hoofnagle, director of University of California, Berkeley Law's information privacy programs, stated that Google's original intention expressed by the \\"don't be evil\\" motto was linked to the company's separation of search results from advertising. However, he observed that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus, Google's practice had since become mainstream and was no longer remarkable or good. Hoofnagle argued that Google should abandon the motto because: In a 2013 NPR interview, Eric Schmidt revealed that when Larry Page and Sergey Brin recommended the motto as a guiding principle for Google, he \\"thought this was the stupidest rule ever\\", but then changed his opinion after a meeting where an engineer successfully referred to the motto when expressing concerns about a planned advertising product, which was eventually cancelled. Journalists have raised questions about the actual definition of what Google considered \\"evil\\". On the user- facing 'What We Believe' page, Google appeared to replace the original motto altogether (a carefully reworded version stood as of 10 April 2015, \\"You can make money without doing evil\\", which varied significantly from the absolute imperative of DON'T be evil). Use in criticism of Google Critics of Google frequently spin the motto in a negative way, such as InfoWorld's 2014 article \\"Google? Evil? You have no idea\\". Google's 2012 announcement to \\"begin tracking users universally across all its services\\" (via \\"Google Plus\\" accounts) resulted in public backlash on the motto, like \\"Google's Broken Promise: The End of 'Don't Be Evil'\\" on Gizmodo. In the same year, major social networks even co-developed a Don't be evil browser bookmarklet (specifically to expose alleged SERP manipulation promoting Google-owned content over that of others). On 16 May 2013, Margaret Hodge MP, the chair of the United Kingdom Public Accounts Committee, accused Google of being \\"calculated and unethical\\" over its use of highly contrived and artificial distinctions to avoid paying billions of pounds in corporation tax owed by its UK operations. The company was accused by the committee, which represents the interests of all UK taxpayers, of being \\"evil\\" for not paying its \\"fair amount of tax\\". She told Matt Brittin, head of Google UK, \\"I think that you do evil\\". In 2015, the UK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large multinational corporations' artificial tax avoidance. In 2015, the Commercial Appeal reported that \\"critics say Google's recent moves belie search giant's motto\\".

Manufacture In Canada, production began in 1939 at Lewis Avenue, Niagara Falls, Ontario. Shreddies were produced under the Nabisco name until the brand in Canada was purchased in 1993 by Post Cereals, whose parent company in 1995 became Kraft General Foods, which sold Post to Ralcorp in 2008 and is now Post Foods Canada Corp., a unit of Post Holdings, which was spun off from Ralcorp in 2012. In the United Kingdom, the cereal was first produced by Nabisco's former UK division, but is now made by Cereal Partners under the Nestl√© brand at Welwyn Garden City. The factory opened in 1926 and began making Shreddies in 1953. The site was briefly owned by Rank Hovis McDougall in 1988, which sold it to Cereal Partners in 1990. Nestl√©'s site at Staverton started making Shreddies in 1998, and is where all production was moved in 2007. The cereal is marketed with the whole grain symbol, as part of a marketing campaign emphasising the healthiness of the cereal. Wheat for Shreddies is sourced from over 500 different farms within the UK.trulyresponsible.org ¬ª Nestl√© - Shreddies Sugared, chocolate and honey-flavoured versions of the cereal are available in the UK as Frosted Shreddies, Coco Shreddies, and Honey Shreddies, an orange- flavoured and coconut infused version of the Coco Shreddies have also become available recently. The former advertising slogan in the UK was: \\"Keeps hunger locked up until lunch\\". The advertising slogan for the Frosted and Coco Shreddies was: \\"Too tasty for geeks\\".

By the late 1990s, the characters were discontinued in all advertising and packaging. The cereal is now marketed as an \\"adult\\" cereal. *In January 2008, the company launched a new ad campaign for so-called \\"Diamond Shreddies\\". The tongue-in-cheek ads claimed the cereal's shape had been changed to diamond, and presented the original square Shreddies, rotated 45¬∞. Consumer reaction to the campaign has translated into a statistically significant sales increase, according to at least one media report on the campaign's success.Maclean's Article, May 2008 The campaign won the 2008 Grand Clio Award for Integrated (i.e. multiple media) Campaign.Clio 2008 =United Kingdom= *For many years in the UK, the Shreddies boxes featured Tom and Jerry. They regularly featured gifts in the boxes featuring Tom and Jerry, such as glow-in-the-dark stickers sets and puzzle books. *For a few years, Shreddies' advertising campaigns featured a cartoon personification of \\"Hunger\\" as an antagonist. He appeared as a blue monster with big teeth whose goal was to taunt hungry individuals by drumming on their stomachs with a pair of silver spoons. Hunger then was dispatched when the victim consumed a bowl of Shreddies, sealing Hunger inside a shreddie cage. Despite his troublesome persona, Hunger was frequently used as a mascot for the cereal during this period.Shreddies - Keeps Hunger Locked up till lunch - YouTube The message during this time was \\"Shreddies keep hunger locked up 'til lunch\\" and most ads ended with a box of Shreddies rolling up in front of Hunger, who then gets crushed between it and a box of Frosted Shreddies zooming in from behind him. * For a while in the early 2000s, Frosted and Coco Shreddies were advertised as \\"too tasty for geeks\\". The advertisements featured \\"geeks\\" trying to eat a bowl of either Frosted or Coco Shreddies, but being overwhelmed by its taste by being launched into the air like a rocket, followed by a much cooler kid named Sure-Eddie being able to easily eat the Shreddies. In 2003, Coco Shreddies were coated with more chocolate. * In 2005, Shreddies were advertised as school fuel. The advertisements showed school children being focused on their work at school after eating a bowl of Shreddies for breakfast at home. This TV advertisement was ordered to be removed by the ASA as it was held to provide an unfair comparison between school children eating Shreddies or eating nothing, rather than a similar cereal.Serial complaints *In 2007, Shreddies' advertising centred on the claim that they are \\"knitted by nanas\\" with shots of a factory full of grandmothers knitting Shreddies. The ad was voted the seventh-favourite advertisement of 2007. And from 2007 - 2011 the packaging was changed to include a photo, of the inner flaps, of the nana who apparently knitted the Shreddies for that specific box. *In 2010, supporting the launch of a new \\"Scrumptious new recipe\\", Shreddies launched a promotion to find new nanas, using TV, digital and Facebook; this subsequently built a huge fan base on Facebook.Shreddies Facebook Fan page The fan page is now the second-largest cereal fansite in the world, providing entertainment, competitions, and launching new advertisements to its loyal followers. * In 2012, the Shreddies Knitting Nanas continued to be used to represent the brand. The campaign was launched on Facebook to the fans in a 1-month build up to the premiere, with the advertisement going live on TV weeks later in April.

Shreddies were part of the survival supplies Julian, Ricky, and Bubbles sent with Jacob Collins and his Boys on their outing to lay a model train track across the Canada- US border in the episode \\"We Can't Call People Without Wings Angels, So We Call Them Friends\\". Other supplies sent with them included liquorice and cannabis. The train track Jacob and his minions constructed was intended for use in smuggling cannabis across the Canada - US border.

The building was constructed in 1963 as the London Gardens, home to the London Knights ice hockey team. In 1994 it was renamed London Ice House. In early 2005 it was remodeled into the Forest City Velodrome by local cycling enthusiast and track racer Rob Good and Albert Coulier's Apollo Velodrome Systems company. It is one of two velodromes in Ontario and one of five indoor cycling facilities in all North America. The Forest City Velodrome is the shortest permanent velodrome in the world, measuring 138 metres with 50-degree bankings and 17-degree straights. The Forest City Velodrome runs several programs designed to encourage recreational cycling and develop competitive cyclists. Learn to ride programs introduce new riders to track cycling. Organized drills help cyclists hone their skills. Frequent recreational sessions give riders of various skill levels time to ride on the track for fun, fitness and training. Periodic race nights develop racing skills and give spectators the chance to learn about and enjoy track cycling events. In 2013, the track hosted the Ontario Provincial Track Championships. The building that is now called the Forest City Velodrome has gone through many alterations over the years. One of its more famous moments took place in February 1968 when Johnny Cash proposed to June Carter on stage during a performance. 2019 24-Hour Track Attack In February 2019, Canadian Hour record-holder and former National Team cyclist Ed Veal rode the Forest City Velodrome for 24 hours to set a new Canadian record for distance covered over the period, and to raise money to support upgrades and renovations of the Forest City Velodrome. Over $50,000 was raised by the event. Members of the Forest City Velodrome contributed to the event as support riders for Veal during the event.

The studios, offices and three-tower transmitter are on Eisenhauer Road in San Antonio.KTSA.com/contact FM Translator KTSA programming can also be heard on FM translator K296GK at 107.1 MHz.Radio-Locator.com/K296GK Since KTSA is a Class B station broadcasting with 5 kilowatts twenty four hours per day, the fm translator doesn't necessarily improve coverage, but it does afford the listener the ability to listen to high fidelity sound on the FM band. Weekdays feature mostly local talk hosts by day, with some syndicated shows in afternoons and nights, including Dave Ramsey, Lars Larson, Dana Loesch and Red Eye Radio. Weekends include programs on money, health, home repair, cars, gardening and pets. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. Most hours begin with world and national news from ABC News Radio. History =Early Years= KTSA was first licensed, with the sequentially assigned call letters WCAR, on May 9, 1922 to John C. Rodriguez's Alamo Radio Electric Company at 608 West Evergreen Street.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1922, page 4. (Before January 1923, radio stations in Texas were given call signs beginning with W.) WCAR was the first licensed radio station in San Antonio, however it was the second to begin broadcasting, taking the airwaves shortly after the short-lived San Antonio Express station, WJAE, debuted on August 5.\\"WJAE Fills Air With Harmonies By Radio's Aid\\", San Antonio Express, August 6, 1922, page 12. WCAR was initially assigned to the sole available \\"entertainment wavelength\\" of the time, 360 meters (833 kHz), which required it to establish a time-sharing agreement with the other local stations. A schedule published on August 16, 1922 covering the next five days reported that WCAR and WJAE had an evening broadcast slot of one hour each.\\"Broadcasting Schedule\\", San Antonio Express, August 16, 1922, page 4. In late 1924 WCAR was reassigned to 1140 kHz.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 2, 1925, page 7. The call sign changed from WCAR to KTSA in early 1927,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1927, page 6. reflecting the slogan \\"Kum To San Antonio\\", and later that year the station was assigned to 1130 kHz.\\"Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 31, 1928, Radio Service Bulletin, page 19. On November 11, 1928, with the implementation of the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, KTSA was assigned to 1290 kHz on a time-sharing basis with KFUL in Galveston.\\"Broadcasting Stations by Wave Lengths, Effective November 11, 1928\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the United States (June 30, 1928 edition), page 174. KTSA's full-time operation began on April 29, 1933, after the FRC approved WCAR's purchase and shutting down of KFUL. In 1935, KTSA moved to 550 kHz, increasing its daytime coverage area by going from 1,000 to 5,000 watts.\\"Actions of the Federal Communications Commission\\" (March 20), Broadcasting, April 1, 1935, page 49. The station was owned by Southwest Broadcasting Company at this time, and it became an affiliate of the Southwest Network and the CBS Radio Network. KTSA carried the network's schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio. On October 28, 1940, KTSA played host to the first and only meeting between noted science fiction author H.G. Wells and radio dramatist Orson Welles, which occurred nearly two years after the panic created by Welles' broadcast of The War of the Worlds. An advertisement in the 1949 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook said KTSA had been a CBS affiliate for 20 years, delivering 25.1% more radio families in the daytime and 20.6% more radio families in the nighttime.Broadcasting Yearbook 1949 page 263 The ad was aimed at advertisers who might otherwise want to buy time on NBC Red Network affiliate 1200 WOAI, which remains KTSA's rival to this day. =Top 40 Era= For a time the San Antonio Express-News Corporation owned the station. In 1956, rock and roll radio pioneer Gordon McLendon bought KTSA.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page 239 He made it one of the first full-time Top 40 stations in America. KTSA became an overnight sensation because of the music and outrageous, for the time, promotions. One included a flagpole sitter at the O. R. Mitchell Dodge used car dealership on Broadway, and the KTSA Easter Egg Hunt, which swamped San Pedro Springs Park with thousands of listeners searching for a $1000 KTSA Golden Egg. In 1957, KTSA got competition from AM 860 KONO, which changed to a top 40 format and hired several of KTSA's disk jockeys. By this time, McLendon had successful stations in El Paso (KELP), Dallas (KLIF), and Houston (KILT), and used the El Paso and San Antonio stations as farm teams for his larger markets. Because KTSA was located at 550 on the dial, his station promoted on the air that it played the \\"Top 55 Hits.\\" Under McLendon ownership, KTSA obtained Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permission to use the call letters \\"KAKI-FM\\" on KTSA's planned FM station, reportedly to honor San Antonio's military personnel (with \\"KAKI\\" meaning \\"khaki\\", a type of fabric used in military uniforms). In 1958 KTSA's call letters were also briefly switched to KAKI. After KAKI-AM-FM letterhead and promotional materials were printed, management learned that the call letters could be pronounced as slang in Spanish for baby feces. AM 550 quickly returned to its KTSA call sign. And plans to put the FM station on the air were scrapped.Durkee, Rob. American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century. . New York City: Schirmer Books, 1999, p.14. Accessed December 10, 2007. McLendon sold KTSA in 1965. The FCC had a rule at that time that a single owner could not own more than seven radio stations nationally. When McLendon bought his eighth radio station, San Antonio was one of his smallest markets. So he sold KTSA to Waterman Broadcasting, with Bernard Waterman as the president. KTSA remained one of San Antonio's most listened-to stations until contemporary music listening switched to FM radio. In 1969, KTSA signed on an FM sister station, 102.7 KTFM (now KJKK).Broadcasting Yearbook 1974 page B-212 =Switch to Talk Radio= In the 1980s, the Top 40 format moved over to KTFM, while KTSA switched to a full service adult contemporary sound, with some talk programming at night. By 1986, the music had been eliminated and the station became a fulltime talk outlet. In 2000, KTSA and its FM station, then with the call letters KSRX, were acquired by the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, a division of CBS. Then in 2007, KTSA and its FM station, 102.7 KJXK, were bought by Border Media Partners (BMP Radio) for $45 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2009 D-540 On July 27, 2009, Border Media Partners was taken over by its lenders in an \\"amicable manner,\\" according to an FCC filing. Border Media had not made a debt payment in two years, according to the San Antonio Express-News. This resulted in BMP selling the station to L&L; Broadcasting (now Alpha Media) in 2013. Former On-Air Staff KTSA staff inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame include Ricci Ware, Brad Messer, Don Keyes, and Barry Kaye. Popular 1950s and 1960s rock and roll disk jockeys also included Bruce Hathaway, Pat Tallman and Charlie Vann. Mark Velasco was a popular KTSA host in the 1980s. FM Translator On February 26, 2015, KTSA began simulcasting on FM translator K296GK 107.1 FM in San Antonio, which was upgraded and moved from its original city of license in Pleasanton, Texas.

William Miller of Textron, and Jim Winoker and Dominic Zinni of B.B. Greenberg Company, who purchased the hotel and implemented Federal tax credits to rehabilitate the building, reopening it in 1979 as the Biltmore Plaza Hotel. The Biltmore's external glass elevator was added during this rehabilitation, and served all 18 floors of the hotel (though it no longer runs). In 1983, the owners retained Dunfey Hotels to manage the property, and it was renamed Biltmore Plaza, A Dunfey Hotel.

He became an official member of The Allman Brothers Band in 1999. In 2010, he formed the Tedeschi Trucks Band with his wife, blues singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi. His musical style encompasses several genres and he has twice appeared on Rolling Stones list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. He is the nephew of Butch Trucks, drummer for the Allman Brothers. Early life A young Trucks (right) with musician Livingston Taylor Trucks age 9-10 with the Gregg Allman band Trucks was born in Jacksonville, Florida. According to Trucks, the name of Eric Clapton's band, Derek and the Dominos, had \\"something to do with the name [Derek] if not the spelling\\". Trucks bought his first guitar at a yard sale for $5 at age nine and became a child prodigy, playing his first paid performance at age 11. Trucks began playing the guitar using a slide because it allowed him to play the guitar despite his small hands as a young guitarist. By his 13th birthday, Trucks had played alongside Buddy Guy and toured with Thunderhawk. Career Trucks formed The Derek Trucks Band in 1994, and by his 20th birthday, he had played with such artists as Bob Dylan, Joe Walsh, and Stephen Stills. In 1999, he toured as a member of Phil Lesh & Friends. Turner, Rob https://jambands.com/features/2006/03/16/derek-trucks- songlines/ Jambands.com After performing with The Allman Brothers Band for several years as a guest musician, Trucks became a formal member of the band in 1999 and appeared on the albums Peakin' at the Beacon, Live at the Beacon Theatre, Hittin' the Note and One Way Out. In 2006 Trucks began a studio collaboration with JJ Cale and Eric Clapton called The Road to Escondido and performed with three bands in 17 different countries that year. Trucks was invited to perform at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival, and after the festival, he toured as part of Clapton's band. Merging talents Trucks built a studio in his home in January 2008, and his band and he recorded the album Already Free. Trucks and his wife, Susan Tedeschi, combined their bands to form the Soul Stew Revival in 2007 and performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June 2008. In late 2009, Trucks and his band went on hiatus, after which the band dissolved. In 2010, Trucks formed the Tedeschi Trucks Band with his wife. On January 8, 2014, Trucks announced that he and fellow guitarist Warren Haynes planned to leave the Allman Brothers Band at the end of 2014. That band announced its retirement, with Trucks playing as a member through their final show on October 28, 2014, at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Musical style Trucks credits guitarist Duane Allman and bluesman Elmore James as the two slide guitarists who influenced his early style, but has since been inspired by John Lee Hooker, Ali Akbar Khan, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, Miles Davis, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, Wayne Shorter, Toy Caldwell, Johnny Winter, Freddie King and B.B. King. His music is rooted in blues and rock, embracing jam band, Southern rock, and jazz. Trucks plays an eclectic blend of blues, soul, jazz, rock, qawwali music (a genre of music from Pakistan and eastern India), Latin music, and other kinds of world music Trucks became a fan of Hindustani classical musician Ali Akbar Khan, known for his virtuosity in playing the sarod and popularising Indian classical music in the West, often in conjunction with sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar. Trucks studied at the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael, California. Trucks playing a resonator guitar Trucks plays the guitar in an open E tuning, using a Dunlop Blues Bottle slide. In 2006, two vintage (1965 and 1968) Fender Super Reverb amplifiers, a Hammond B-3 organ, two Leslie speaker cabinets, and a Hohner E-7 clavinet were stolen from Trucks and later recovered by the Atlanta Police Department.

A 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal described him as \\"the most awe-inspiring electric slide guitar player performing today\\". In 2007, Trucks appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone for an article called the \\"New Guitar Gods\\". Trucks is a creative guitarist according to his uncle, Allman Brothers drummer Butch Trucks: \\"He never does the same thing twice\\". The Washington Post in 2009 described Trucks' guitar style as \\"notes and chords that soar, slice, and glide, sounding like a cross between Duane Allman on a '61 Gibson Les Paul and John Coltrane on tenor sax\\". The Derek Trucks Band's album Already Free debuted at number 19 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and number one on the Internet chart, number four on the rock chart, and number one on the blues chart.

Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin, exhibited The Little Match Girl Ballet (1975) and archived an essay dedicated to Antin and her work on their website Early life and education Eleanor Fineman was born in the Bronx on February 27, 1935.\\"Eleanor Antin\\", Jewish Women's Archive; retrieved February 23, 2017. Her parents, Sol Fineman and Jeanette Efron, were Polish Jews who had recently immigrated to the United States. She attended the Music and Art High School in New York, New School for Social Research, and then the City College of New York, graduating in 1958. There she met David Antin, a poet who would become her husband in 1961. She studied acting and had some roles, including performing in a staged reading with Ossie Davis at the first NAACP convention. She and her husband moved to San Diego in 1968. She taught at the University of California at Irvine from 1974‚Äì79, and from 1979 was professor of visual arts at the University of California at San Diego.  Career  When she began her artistic career in New York, she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages, but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus. The first was Blood of a Poet Box (1965-1968), in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides. The work, which was inspired by Jean Cocteau‚Äôs film Blood of a Poet, eventually held 100 samples, including blood from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and is in the collection of the Tate Modern. In 1969, she created a portrait, Molly Barnes, out of \\"a lush lavender bath rug, a noisy electric Lady Schick razor, a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills.\\" Molly Barnes was just one of a series of \\"semantic portraits of people, sometimes real, some-times fictional, [made] out of configurations of brand-new consumer goods\\" that Antin created. 100 Boots is Antin's best-known conceptual work. In this project, she set up 100 boots in various configurations and settings, photographed them, and created 51 postcards of the images that were mailed to hundreds of recipients around the world from 1971-73. 100 Boots relied on the recipients to remember and construct the boots' adventures, as the postcards were mailed out at intervals ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks \\"depending upon what [Antin] took to be the 'internal necessities' of the narrative.\\" It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo diary, beginning at the Pacific Ocean and ending in New York City, where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. In a famous performance work of 1972, Carving: A Traditional Sculpture, Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting. The somber, almost classical work is a staple of early feminist art, according to the New York Times art critic Karen Rosenberg. In The Eight Temptations, 1972, Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures, resisting the temptation to eat snack foods that would violate her diet. In the 1970s/80s, she created several videos in which she played invented personae, including an Elizabethan-style king, a Romantic- era ballerina, a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova, and Eleanor Nightingale, a character that is a combination of Florence Nightingale and the artist herself. In 1974, Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self: \\"I was interested in defining the limits of myself. I consider the usual aids to self-definition‚Äîsex, age, talent, time and space‚Äîas tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice.\\" From the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called \\"Selves\\" that implemented through several art forms. This project encompassed four videos: The King (1972), The Ballerina and the Bum (1974), The Adventures of a Nurse (1976), and From the Archives of Modern Art (1987). More recently, Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology: The Last Days of Pompeii, 2002, and Roman Allegories, 2005. Her work was profiled in Season Two of the PBS series Art:21. She has had dozens of solo exhibitions and has been represented in countless group exhibitions, including at the Hirshhorn Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Kunsthalle Wien, and documenta 12 in Kassel. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Jewish Museum, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. Her work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society. \\"I was determined to present women without pathos or helplessness,\\" she wrote in a feminist artist statement for the Brooklyn Museum. In a 2009 interview, Antin described her path to becoming an artist: \\"When I was a kid, I didn't know what kind of artist I was. I knew I was an artist, I just didn't know if I was an actor, I didn't know if I was a writer, I didn't even know if I was a painter. I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down. It was a time of invention and discovery. I was lucky.\\" In 2013, Antin published an autobiographical novel, Conversations with Stalin, about \\"a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants\\", and \\"her desperate, endearing, often hilarious quest for art, self, revolution and sex, abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice.\\" Selected solo exhibitions * \\"100 Boots\\" at MoMA, 1973, New York, New York. * \\"Eleanor Antin, R.N.

Founded in 1957, this diocese was created from territory that once belonged to the Diocese of Brooklyn. It is the sixth-largest Catholic diocese in the United States, currently serving approximately 1.5 million people in 134 parishes. The diocese is named for the village where its cathedral, St. Agnes Cathedral, is located, Rockville Centre in Nassau County. The fifth and current bishop is John Barres. History The Diocese of Rockville Centre was split off from the Diocese of Brooklyn April 6, 1957. St. Agnes Cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. Walter P. Kellenberg, former Bishop of Ogdensburg served as first bishop of the diocese from 1957 to 1976. He founded the diocese's Catholic Charities office in 1957. Kellenberg was followed by Bishop John McGann, who retired in 2000 and died in 2002. The diocese was led briefly by Bishop James T. McHugh, who died of cancer on December 10, 2000. William Murphy served as the diocese's fourth bishop from 2001 to 2017. Murphy arrived in Long Island from his native Archdiocese of Boston, where he served as the archdiocese's vicar general. He was succeeded by John Barres on January 31, 2017. =Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy= By August 2019, 68 clergy who served in the Diocese of Rockville Centre were \\"credibly accused\\" of committing acts of sex abuse. Some were either convicted for their crimes or agreed to pay financial settlements. Former priest Robert E. Guglielmone, who was later appointed Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston in South Carolina, was also revealed to have been named as a defendant in a sex abuse lawsuit in the state of New York and is accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the Diocese of Rockville Centre. On May 8, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo extended the 2019 New York Child Victims Act's statute of limitation deadline to file sex abuse lawsuits from August 14, 2020 to January 14, 2021. On May 13, 2020, a Nassau County Supreme Court justice allowed pending lawsuits against the Diocese of Rockville Centre to proceed after rejecting claims that the New York Child Victims Act, which serves as the legal basis for the upcoming sex abuse lawsuits, violated due process. In June 2020, the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which also suffered significant financial damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, filed court documents which stated that the Diocese will file for bankruptcy if there is no pause in nearly 100 pending sex abuse lawsuits. On October 1, 2020, the diocese of Rockville Center became the fourth diocese in New York state to file for bankruptcy as a result of the sexual abuse litigations.

It was one of three palatial hotels built as part of the Terminal City development around Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. The others were the Commodore Hotel (currently Grand Hyatt New York), and the defunct Roosevelt Hotel. History The New York Biltmore was founded by Gustav Baumann, who purchased the lease from the New York State Realty and Terminal Company, a division of the New York Central Railroad. The design was by the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore, which also created the adjoining Grand Central Terminal. The hotel had its own arrival station within the terminal, nicknamed \\"The Kissing Room,\\" with elevator access to the lobby. A private elevator served only the Presidential Suite. The Tea Room (a.k.a. Palm Court) echoed the design of the main concourse at the Terminal. On the 22nd floor of the hotel was the grand ballroom, called the Cascades; Bert Lown was the conductor in the hotel's early years. Between the north and south towers was the Italian Garden, which overlooked Vanderbilt Avenue and Grand Central Terminal. In the winter months the garden was transformed into an ice skating rink. Henry Ford tried to broker a truce agreement to halt World War I while headquartered at The Biltmore, 1915. The hotel opened on New Year's Day 1913, and was operated by Baumann until his death on October 15, 1914. John McEntee Bowman, the Biltmore's manager under Mr. Baumann, took control of the lease and operated the hotel thereafter. The New York Biltmore Hotel ceased operation when the building was gutted in August 1981 by its then owners Paul Milstein and Seymour Milstein. The demolition took place despite the building's landmark status and concerted protests by preservationists. The hotel was stripped down to its steel structural skeleton and rebuilt as Bank of America Plaza. Though the bank is still the largest tenant, the building is today known simply by its address, 335 Madison Avenue. Grand Central Art Galleries For 23 years the Biltmore was the home to the Grand Central Art Galleries, founded in 1922 by Walter Leighton Clark together with John Singer Sargent, Edmund Greacen, and others.\\"Painters and Sculptors' Gallery Association to Begin Work,\\" New York Times, December 19, 1922 Originally in Grand Central Terminal, in 1958 the Galleries moved to the second floor of the Biltmore, where they had six exhibition rooms and an office. The galleries remained at the Biltmore until the structure was stripped to its steel frame and converted into an office building by the Milstein Brothers. The final show was \\"Anita Loos and Friends.\\" Describing the end of the Biltmore and the Grand Central Art Galleries' final show there, John Russell of New York Times wrote: > \\"Hardly since Samson tore down the great temple at Gaza has a building > disappeared as rapidly as the Biltmore Hotel. But people have shown a rare > persistence this last day or two in pushing their way upstairs at the > entrance on Vanderbilt Avenue to where the Grand Central Galleries has been > holding its own.\\" Role in history and popular culture The Treaty of the Danish West Indies of 1916 was signed at the hotel, which transferred possession of the Danish West Indies, now the United States Virgin Islands, from Denmark to the United States. The reclusive writer J. D. Salinger would meet William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, under the Biltmore's lobby clock. It is one of many that claim to be the basis for the expression \\"Meet me under the clock.\\" The office building retains the hotel's famous piano and lobby clock. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 short story \\"May Day\\", a main character, Edith, continually asserts that she is staying at the Biltmore. Fitzgerald seems to deliberately associate the Biltmore with Jazz Age luxury and lifestyle. In 1942, the hotel was the location of the Biltmore Conference which was a meeting of Zionist groups that produced the Biltmore Program, a series of demands regarding Palestine. Author Frank McCourt began work in the Biltmore shortly after returning to live in New York in 1949. He recounts his experiences there in his second memoir 'Tis. In the 1950 Broadway musical Guys and Dolls, the gamblers are desperately searching for a location for their illegal crap game. In the song \\"The Oldest Established (Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York),\\" Nicely-Nicely Johnson sings: \\"The Biltmore garage wants a grand [$1,000], but we ain't got a grand on hand.\\"\\"The Oldest Established\\", from Lyrics Mania. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Biltmore was the scene of the feminist protests. The hotel's Men's Bar, at Madison Avenue and 43rd Street, had been a male-only establishment for decades, with regulars such as New York mayor (and later governor) Al Smith. The city Human Rights Commission ordered the hotel to open the bar's doors to female patrons. It was subsequently renamed the Biltmore Bar.

He was born at Kleinwaltersdorf, near Freiberg in the Electorate of Saxony, on 2 January 1800. His father, though only a poor working miner, found the means to have him educated first at the Bergschule (mining school) and then at the Bergakademie of Freiberg. After he had completed his courses there in 1820 he obtained employment, chiefly as an assayer, in connexion with the royal mines and metal works. Having taken up the idea of quantitative mouth blowpipe assaying, which was then almost unknown, he succeeded in devising dependable methods for all the ordinary useful metals. In particular his modes of assaying for nickel and cobalt quickly found favour with metallurgists. He also devoted himself to the improvement of qualitative blowpipe analysis, and summed up his experience in a treatise Die Probierkunst mit dem L√∂throhr (1835), which became a standard authority. In 1840 he was made chief of the royal department of assaying. Two years later he was deputed to complete a course of lectures on metallurgy at the Bergakademie in place of W. A. Lampadius (1772‚Äì1842), whom he subsequently succeeded as professor. He died at Freiberg on 22 January 1858. In addition to many memoirs on metallurgical subjects he also published Die metallurgischen Rostprocesse theoretisch betrachtet, and posthumously Vorlesungen √ºber allgemeine H√ºttenkunde.

He was a member of two Arctic expeditions to rescue the explorer Sir John Franklin. He was present at the discovery of Franklin's first winter camp, but he did not find out what had happened to the fatal expedition.  Early life  Born in Philadelphia, Kane was the son of John Kintzing Kane, a U.S. district judge, and Jane Duval Leiper. His maternal grandfather was Thomas Leiper, American Revolutionary War patriot and a founder of the Philadelphia City Troop. His brother was attorney, diplomat, abolitionist, and Civil War general, Thomas L. Kane. Kane graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1842.  Career  On September 14, 1843, he became an assistant surgeon in the Navy. He served in the China Commercial Treaty mission under Caleb Cushing, in the Africa Squadron, and in the United States Marine Corps during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. One battle that Kane fought in was at Nopalucan on January 6, 1848. At Nopalucan, he captured, befriended, and saved the life of Mexican General Antonio Gaona and the general's wounded son.Joe Musso, Kane Knife October 28, 2004 Kane was appointed senior medical officer of the Grinnell Arctic expedition of 1850‚Äì1851 under the command of Edwin de Haven, which searched unsuccessfully for Sir John Franklin's lost expedition. During this expedition, the crew discovered Franklin's first winter camp. In 1852, Kane met the Fox sisters, famous for their spirit rapping s√©ances, and he became enamored with the middle sister, Margaret. Kane was convinced that the sisters were frauds, and sought to reform Margaret. She would later claim that they were secretly married in 1856‚Äîshe changed her name to Margaret Fox Kane‚Äîand engaged the family in lawsuits over his will. After Kane's death, Margaret converted to the Roman Catholic faith, but would eventually return to spiritualism.Doyle 1926: volume 1, 89‚Äì94 Kane then organized and headed the Second Grinnell expedition which sailed from New York on May 31, 1853, and wintered in Rensselaer Bay. Though suffering from scurvy, and at times near death, he pushed on and charted the coasts of Smith Sound and the Kane Basin, penetrating farther north than any other explorer had done up to that time. At Cape Constitution he discovered the ice-free Kennedy Channel, later followed by Isaac Israel Hayes, Charles Francis Hall, Augustus Greely, and Robert E. Peary in turn as they drove toward the North Pole. Kane finally abandoned the icebound brig on May 20, 1855, and made an 83-day march of indomitable courage to Upernavik. The party, carrying the invalids, lost only one man. Kane and his men were saved by a sailing ship. Kane returned to New York on October 11, 1855, and the following year published his two-volume Arctic Explorations.  Death  Elisha Kent Kane mausoleum and historical plaque in Laurel Hill Cemetery After visiting England to fulfill his promise to deliver his report personally to Lady Jane Franklin, he sailed to Havana in a vain attempt to recover his health, after being advised to do so by his doctor. He died there on February 16, 1857. His body was brought to New Orleans and carried by steamboat and a funeral train to Philadelphia; the train was met at nearly every platform by a memorial delegation, and is said to have been the longest funeral train of the century, surpassed only by that of Abraham Lincoln. After lying in state at Independence Hall, he was transported to Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery where he was placed in the family vault on the hillside near what is now Kelly Drive.  Legacy  Kane received medals from Congress, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie. The Geographical Society of Philadelphia created the Elisha Kent Kane Medal in his honor. He was also elected to the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory The Anoatok historic manor at Kane, Pennsylvania, was named to allude to his Arctic adventures. The destroyer was named for him, as was a later oceanographic research ship, the . A lunar crater, Kane, was also named for him.

The kingship signified the exceptional status of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire. Ottokar's P≈ôemyslid ancestor Vratislaus II had already been elevated to a Bohemian king by Emperor Henry IV in 1085 at the diet in Mainz. He was crowned at Prague by Archbishop Egilbert of Trier the next year, the title however was not hereditary and upon his death in 1092, his brother Conrad I succeeded him again as Bohemian duke. In 1158 Vratislaus' grandson Vladislaus II achieved kingship again, bestowed by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, whom he had accompanied on his Italian campaign against Milan, but failed to secure the succession of his eldest son Frederick. In September 1198 Frederick's younger half-brother Ottokar I made use of the rivalry among Otto IV from the House of Welf and the Hohenstaufen duke Philip of Swabia, youngest son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who both had been elected King of the Romans. He received the hereditary royal title by Philip for his support and, maneuvering between both sides, achieved the acknowledgement by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. After the assassination of Philip and the papal ban imposed on Otto IV in 1210, Ottokar again switched sides, when he and several princes in 1211 convened at Nuremberg and elected the young Hohenstaufen scion Frederick II alium imperatorem (\\"Other Emperor\\"). Frederick, then King of Sicily, left for his coronation in Germany, reaching Basel in September 1212. Here he issued the Golden Bull that confirmed the kingship of Ottokar I and his heirs in Bohemia. According to the Golden Bull of Sicily, the estates of Bohemia and Moravia were an autonomous and undivisible constituent of the Holy Roman Empire. The King of Bohemia was no longer subject to appointment by the Emperor, and was only required to attend Reichstag diets close to the Bohemian border. Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the premier Prince-elector (Kurf√ºrst) of the Empire and to furnish all subsequent Emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation. By this act Frederick II also declared that he and the Empire will give the investiture for Bohemia only to a ruler approved by the people of the country. When in 1346 King Charles IV united the rule over Bohemia and Germany in his hands, he established the Crown of Bohemia, which remained beyond the Empire's suzerainty and were not considered Imperial States. As part of the 800th anniversary of the document's signature, the document was put on public display at the National Archive for four days in September 2012.

It was founded as the brainchild of H. L. Mencken and drama critic George Jean Nathan. The magazine featured writing by some of the most important writers in the United States through the 1920s and 1930s. After a change in ownership in the 1940s, the magazine attracted conservative writers, including William F. Buckley. A second change in ownership in the 1950s turned the magazine into a far-right and virulently anti-Semitic publication. It was published monthly in New York City. The magazine went out of business in 1981, having spent the last 25 years of its existence in decline and controversy.  History  H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan in 1928 H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan had previously edited The Smart Set literary magazine, when not producing their own books and, in Mencken's case, regular journalism for The Baltimore Sun. With their mutual book publisher Alfred A. Knopf Sr. serving as the publisher, Mencken and Nathan created The American Mercury as \\"a serious review, the gaudiest and damnedest ever seen in the Republic\\", as Mencken explained the name (derived from a 19th-century publication) to his old friend and contributor Theodore Dreiser: > What we need is something that looks highly respectable outwardly. The > American Mercury is almost perfect for that purpose. What will go on inside > the tent is another story. You will recall that the late P. T. Barnum got > away with burlesque shows by calling them moral lectures. From 1924 through 1933, Mencken provided what he promised: elegantly irreverent observations of America, aimed at what he called \\"Americans realistically\\", those of sophisticated skepticism of enough that was popular and much that threatened to be. (Nathan was forced to resign as his co-editor a year after the magazine started.) Simeon Strunsky in The New York Times observed that, \\"The dead hand of the yokelry on the instinct for beauty cannot be so heavy if the handsome green and black cover of The American Mercury exists.\\" The quote was used on the subscription form for the magazine during its heyday. The January 1924 issue sold more than 15,000 copies and by the end of the first year the circulation was over 42,000. In early 1928 the circulation reached a height of over 84,000, but declined steadily after the stock market crash of 1929. The magazine published writing by Conrad Aiken, Sherwood Anderson, James Branch Cabell, W. J. Cash, Lincoln Ross Colcord, Thomas Craven, Clarence Darrow, W. E. B. Du Bois, John Fante, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Albert Halper, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Sinclair Lewis, George Schuyler, Meridel LeSueur, Edgar Lee Masters, Albert Jay Nock, Eugene O'Neill, Carl Sandburg, and William Saroyan. Nathan provided theater criticism, and Mencken wrote the \\"Editorial Notes\\" and \\"The Library\\", the last being book reviews and social critique, placed at the back of each volume. The magazine published other writers, from newspapermen and academics to convicts and taxi drivers, but its primary emphasis soon became non-fiction and usually satirical essays. Its \\"Americana\\" section‚Äîcontaining items clipped from newspapers and other magazines nationwide‚Äîbecame a much- imitated feature. Mencken spiced the package with aphorisms printed in the magazine's margins whenever space allowed. = Mencken's departure = Mencken retired as editor of the magazine at the end of 1933. His chosen successor was economist and literary critic Henry Hazlitt. Differences with the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf Sr., however, led Hazlitt to resign after four months. The American Mercury was next edited by Mencken's former assistant Charles Angoff. At first, the magazine was considered to be moving to the Left. In January 1935, The American Mercury was purchased from Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., by Lawrence E. Spivak. The magazine's longtime business manager, Spivak announced that he would take an active role as publisher. Paul Palmer, former Sunday editor of the New York World, replaced Angoff as editor, and playwright Laurence Stallings was named literary editor. = Radio and television = Lawrence E. Spivak in 1960 Spivak revived the Mercury for a brief but vigorous period ‚Äî Mencken, Nathan, and Angoff contributed essays to the magazine again. Spivak created a company to publish the magazine, Mercury Publications. Soon the company began publishing other magazines, including Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine (1941) and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1949. In 1945 as editor, Lawrence Spivak created a radio program called American Mercury Presents \\"Meet the Press\\". It started on television on November 6, 1947, as Meet the Press. In 1946 the Mercury merged with the democratic-socialist magazine Common Sense. By 1950, the Mercury was owned by Clendenin J. Ryan. He changed the magazine's name to The New American Mercury. Ryan was the financial angel for Ulius Amoss, a former Office of Strategic Services agent who specialized in operating spy networks behind the Iron Curtain to destabilize Communist governments and the publisher of International Services of Information in Baltimore; his son Clendenin Jr. was a sponsor of William F. Buckley Jr. and the Young Americans for Freedom. Ryan transformed The American Mercury in a conservative direction. = Huie's experiment = William Bradford Huie‚Äîwhose work had appeared in the magazine before‚Äîhad gleaned the beginning of a new, post-World War II American conservative intellectual movement. He sensed that Ryan had begun to guide The American Mercury toward that direction. He also introduced more mass-appeal writing, by figures such as Reverend Billy Graham and Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover. Huie seemed en route to producing a conservative magazine. William F. Buckley Jr., whose God and Man at Yale was a best seller, worked for Huie's Mercury, as a young staffer. In 1955, Buckley founded the longer-living conservative National Review. Buckley would succeed at what Huie was unable to realize: a periodical that brought together the nascent but differing strands of this new conservative movement. = Antisemitic and racist takeover = Huie faced financial difficulties sustaining the Mercury in this new direction. In August 1952, he sold it to an occasional financial contributor, Russell Maguire, owner of the Thompson submachine gun Company. Rather than turn over editorial control to Maguire, Huie stepped down as editor after the January 1953 issue. He was replaced by John A. Clements, a former reporter for the New York Journal and Daily Mirror, then director of public relations for the Hearst Corporation. Within a short time, Maguire steered the magazine \\"toward the fever swamps of antisemitism\\", as National Review publisher William A. Rusher would describe it. The sale to Maguire spelled the end of The American Mercury as a mainstream magazine. It survived, steadily declining, for nearly 30 more years. Maguire's anti-semitism led to controversy and the resignation of the magazine's top editors after he took control of the editorial process in 1955. In 1956, George Lincoln Rockwell was hired as a writer, and later became the founder of the American Nazi Party. In January 1959, Maguire published an American Mercury editorial supporting a theory that there was a Jewish conspiracy for world domination. Maguire did not remain long as the magazine's owner/publisher, but other owners continued that direction. Maguire sold the Mercury to the Defenders of the Christian Faith, Inc. (DCF), owned by Reverend Winrod and located in Wichita, Kansas, in 1961. Reverend Winrod, tried and convicted for violations of the Sedition Act of 1918, was known as \\"The Jayhawk Nazi\\" during World War II. The DCF sold it in 1963 to the \\"Legion for the Survival of Freedom\\" of Jason Matthews; the LSF cut a deal in June 1966 with the (original) Washington Observer, finally merging with Western Destiny. Western Destiny was a Liberty Lobby publication owned by Willis Carto and Roger Pearson, a major recipient of Pioneer Fund grants in history. Pearson was a well known neo-Nazi and pro-Fascist who headed the World Anti-Communist League during its most blatantly pro-Fascist periods. Pearson was a close associate of Wickliffe Draper, founder of the Pioneer Fund. By then The American Mercury was a quarterly with a circulation of barely 7,000, and its editorial content was composed almost entirely of attacks upon Jews, African Americans, and other minorities. A 1978 article praised Adolf Hitler as the \\"greatest Spenglerian\\". Another new ownership for the troubled magazine was announced in the autumn of 1979, and the spring 1980 issue celebrated Mencken's centennial, and lamented the passage of his era, \\"before the virus of social, racial, and sexual equality\\" grew in \\"fertile soil in the minds of most Americans\\". The last issue concluded with a plea for contributions to build a computer index ‚Äî with information about the 15,000 most dangerous political activists, actual or alleged, in the United States.  External links  A website called The American Mercury was created in 2010. It was criticized by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the Winter 2013 edition of their magazine Intelligence Report, which called it a \\"Leo Frank Propaganda Site\\" and described it as \\"a resurrected and deeply anti-Semitic online version of H. L. Mencken‚Äôs defunct magazine of the same name\\". The Anti-Defamation League calls it \\"an extreme right-wing site with anti-Semitic content\\", while The Forward referred to it as \\"H.L. Mencken‚Äôs historic magazine, resurrected online by neo-Nazis several years ago\\", which had \\"published several revisionist articles to coincide with this year‚Äôs anniversary\\".

History The Westchester Country Club (or Westchester Biltmore Country Club) was founded in 1922 by John McEntee Bowman , who hired Walter Travis to design two golf courses in the Town of Harrison, New York, as a luxury resort hotel. The West Course was designed for championship play and has hosted PGA tournaments since 1963. The South Course was originally designed for women and higher handicap golfers. Around 1997, the South Course was reconstructed with longer tees, new sand and grass bunkers, water hazards, and some new greens. The South Course is now more competitive with the West Course to accommodate low handicap golfers. Tournaments Westchester Country Club hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship in 1923. The club hosted its first PGA tournament in 1963 with the Thunderbird Classic, also in 1964 and 1965. There was no tour event at Westchester in 1966, and starting in 1967, the Westchester Classic became an annual stop on the PGA Tour through 2007. Jack Nicklaus won the rain- delayed inaugural event (and $50,000) on a Wednesday, and Steve Stricker the last, the initial event of the first FedEx Cup Playoffs. (The tournament name has changed several times since then due to sponsorship switches, and is now called The Northern Trust.) On January 14, 2008, an article in the Journal News announced the PGA Tour's desire to terminate its affiliation with Westchester Country Club. The decision was made primarily because of Tiger Woods' absence in the tournament in 2007 (following his consecutive victories in the WGC-Bridgestone and PGA Championship), and the tournament's subsequent low TV ratings and low attendance. On January 26, a compromise agreement was made between the club and the PGA Tour at a town hall meeting at the club; WCC was paid $1.1 million to move the event from Harrison to Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey, for 2008. In a second compromise agreement, the PGA Tour awarded Westchester a major tournament on the Champions Tour. The Constellation Energy Senior Players Championship was played on the renovated West Course in 2011, won by Fred Couples. In June 2015, Westchester hosted its first LPGA major, the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, won by Inbee Park.

Serving Riverside, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles counties, it runs from SR 91 in Corona to the Interstate 10/SR 57/Kellogg Interchange at the Pomona‚ÄìSan Dimas boundary. The segment from SR 91 to SR 83 in Chino Hills is called the Corona Freeway, formerly the Corona Expressway and before then the Temescal Freeway. SR 71 is designated as the Chino Valley Freeway between SR 83 and the Kellogg Interchange. Route description Beginning at its southern terminus, SR 91 in Corona, SR 71 is an expressway for a half mile when it intersects with Pomona Rincon Road. SR 71 then becomes a freeway up to Rio Rancho Road, where it becomes an expressway up to Mission Boulevard. (previously it was an expressway until its northern terminus, but this segment was upgraded to freeway in 2012.) The route becomes a short freeway for about a mile until it meets at the Kellogg Interchange complex in San Dimas, where it terminates with Interstate 10 and SR 57. As of December 2016, all traffic signals have been removed. Traffic entering and exiting the roads that lead into the nearby neighborhoods (North Ranch Road, Old Pomona Road, and Phillips Drive) may no longer enter or exit northbound due to added barriers in the median of the highway. However, southbound traffic may use these streets. (North Ranch Road, Old Pomona Road, and Phillips Drive can enter the highway via a stop sign.) Just south of the Mission Boulevard exit, all aspects of the highway, such as its alignment, lane width, pavement, barriers, and access, 'upgrade' to freeway standards. The section of highway between Corona and Chino is notorious for thick winter fogs at dawn and dusk, resulting in many automobile collisions when drivers fail to slow down due to reduced visibility. Residents of Los Serranos (now Chino Hills) recall being awakened by sounds of crinkling bumpers, fenders and headlights. As this freeway/expressway serves as an important northwest-southeast corridor between the cities in the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys (eastern Los Angeles County) and the cities of western Riverside County, it is heavily traveled and is used as an alternative to the Orange Freeway, State Route 57 (SR 57) located to the west, and the Ontario Freeway, Interstate 15 (I-15) located to the east. When the route runs through Chino Hills and Chino, there is a high-occupancy vehicle lane available for use; however, this carpool lane ends when the route enters Riverside County (to the south) and Los Angeles County (to the north). The route is a four-lane highway between SR 91 and Central Avenue (excluding HOV lanes), a six-lane highway (excluding HOV lanes) from Central Avenue to SR 60, and again a four- lane highway from SR 60 to I-10/SR 57. SR 71 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 71 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is not designated as a scenic highway by Caltrans. State Route 71 north of Corona History The original routing of Route 71 according to the 1934 listing was from U.S. 80, now Interstate 8, in San Diego north to U.S. Route 66, now State Route 66, near Claremont via Lake Elsinore and Temecula. When the portion between San Diego and Temecula was redesignated U.S. 395, Route 71 was rerouted to run from Pomona to Aguanga. In 1973, it was cut back to its present terminus in Corona, with the portion between Corona and Temecula becoming Interstate 15 and the portion between Temecula and Aguanga becoming Route 371. The early section of the Chino Valley Freeway was built in 1971 from the Kellogg Interchange to the Pomona Freeway (SR 60). The section from SR 60 to the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) was completed in March 1998. In September 2008, construction began on the Mission 71 Project in Pomona. A bridge was constructed to allow Mission Boulevard to pass over Route 71, which now has entrance and exit ramps to Mission. Also, the intersection with Ninth Street was closed. The freeway was extended south to the former intersection at Ninth Street, where it resumes expressway status to the intersection with Old Pomona Road. The construction project was completed in December 2011. Future The City of Pomona is currently working with Caltrans to convert the rest of Route 71 within its borders from its current status as a four-lane expressway to a full eight-lane freeway. This project has an estimated completion date of 2023. Additionally, the Riverside County Transportation Commission plans to construct a two-lane flyover ramp between eastbound SR 91 and northbound SR 71 to replace the current one-lane loop ramp.

It was released in the US in September 1966, but was not released in the UK because of a contractual dispute. In June 1967, a compilation of the Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow albums was released as Sunshine Superman in the UK. Sunshine Superman was named after Donovan's hit single released in the US in July 1966. The tracks from Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow were not mixed into stereo, with the exception of \\"Season of the Witch\\", until the 2011 2-CD deluxe edition issued by UK EMI. In 2017, Sunshine Superman was ranked the 199th greatest album of the 1960s by Pitchfork. History Whilst still incorporating folk music, these recordings mark a distinct change in Donovan's music, representing some of the first psychedelia released. A full rock band backs up Donovan on many of the songs, and the instrumentation had been expanded, being one of the first pop albums extensively to use the sitar and other unique musical instruments. This change is partially the result of working with producer Mickie Most, whose pop sensibilities led to chart hits for many other artists at the time. Donovan's lyrics began to encompass his increasing ability to portray \\"Swinging London\\" and give listeners an insider's look into the mid-sixties pop scene. He was close to The Beatles and Brian Jones at this time, and he became widely known after \\"Sunshine Superman\\" became a chart-topper in the US, and hit number 2 in the UK. Donovan's penchant for name-dropping in songs such as two influenced by his travel to Los Angeles, \\"The Trip\\" and \\"The Fat Angel\\" (written for Cass Elliot) coupled with his chart success helped elevate him to superstar status. In addition to noting the people in the pop scene, Donovan recorded \\"Bert's Blues\\" for his friend and folk music notable Bert Jansch. Contrasting this modern bent was Donovan's fascination with medieval themes in such songs as \\"Legend of a Girl Child Linda\\" (written for Brian Jones' girlfriend Linda Lawrence) and \\"Guinevere\\". Several other songs were recorded for Sunshine Superman, but did not make the cut. These include \\"Museum\\" (later rerecorded and released on Mellow Yellow), \\"Superlungs My Supergirl\\" (later rerecorded and released on Barabajagal) and \\"Breezes of Patchulie\\" (originally called \\"Darkness of My Night\\" and released on Donovan's 1964 demo collection Sixty Four). The Sunshine Superman recordings of these songs were all included on Troubadour The Definitive Collection 1964‚Äì1976. In the video for the Beatles' \\"A Day in the Life\\", a close up of a spinning turntable shows the Epic Records version of Sunshine Superman playing. The film was shot at the recording sessions for the song, which was included on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. A cover version of \\"The Fat Angel\\" was recorded by Jefferson Airplane for their 1968 live album Bless Its Pointed Little Head. Monster Magnet covered \\"Three King Fishers\\" (as \\"Three Kingfishers\\") on their 2013 album Last Patrol, with a live version included on 2014's Milking the Stars: A Re-Imagining of Last Patrol. Track listing =Original album (US)= =2005 EMI Reissued CD Version= =The UK version= Due to the contractual dispute between Pye Records and Epic Records, Donovan's releases were held back in the UK throughout 1966 and early 1967. During this time, Donovan released Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow in the US. To catch up to the Epic Records schedule in America, Pye Records compiled a cross-section of both albums and titled it Sunshine Superman. It was released in the UK (Pye NPL 18181) in June 1967 and reached #25 in the British charts.

Its purpose was to provide a mobile force of fighter and ground attack aircraft that could support Allied army and naval units fighting the Empire of Japan in the South West Pacific Area. One of several Allied tactical air forces formed during World War II, it evolved from the RAAF's No. 10 Operational Group, established a year earlier. Following action in the assaults on Aitape and Noemfoor, the group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force to better reflect its size and role. It was beset with morale and leadership issues in early 1945, but recovered to take part in the battles of Tarakan, North Borneo, and Balikpapan. Reaching its peak strength of over 25,000 personnel in July 1945, No. 1 TAF's squadrons operated such aircraft as the P-40 Kittyhawk, Supermarine Spitfire, Bristol Beaufighter, and B-24 Liberator. The formation remained active following the end of hostilities in the Pacific until it was disbanded on 24 July 1946. History =No. 10 Operational Group= alt=Five men in light-coloured uniforms standing in front of a military aircraft No. 1 TAF was formed as No. 10 Operational Group (No. 10 OG) on 13 November 1943,Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 168‚Äì170 under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 206‚Äì211 The group consisted of No. 77 Wing, operating A-31 Vengeance dive bombers, and No. 78 Wing, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 182‚Äì183 It was to act as a mobile strike force capable of supporting Allied ground and naval units as they advanced against the Japanese in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), as distinct from the RAAF's area commands then based in Northern Australia, which had a static, geographical defence function. No. 10 OG took over the mobile role originally undertaken by No. 9 Operational Group, which by 1944 had itself evolved into a static garrison force in New Guinea and been renamed Northern Command to reflect its new purpose.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 182‚Äì183, 198‚Äì200 After establishing headquarters at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, in support of the US Fifth Air Force, No. 10 OG's first sorties took place on 13 January 1944, when Kittyhawks of No. 78 Wing launched patrols and bombing missions near Madang.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 186‚Äì187 By March 1944, No. 77 Wing's Vengeances had been withdrawn from operations due to their inferiority to newer equipment. Three RAAF squadrons‚Äîone each flying Bostons, Beaufighters, and Beauforts‚Äîwere assigned to the Wing as replacements.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 196‚Äì198 Following his promotion to air commodore, Scherger led No. 10 OG in Operation Persecution, the assault on Aitape, New Guinea, in April 1944. With airfield construction elements of No. 10 OG going ashore shortly after the attack, Aitape airstrip was repaired and No. 78 Wing was operating from it within three days.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 210‚Äì211 This operation was followed by the attack on Noemfoor, commencing in June, by which time No. 10 OG's combat strength consisted of Nos. 71, 77, 78 and 81 Wings RAAF. Scherger was injured in a jeep accident that August and replaced by Air Commodore Harry Cobby.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 237‚Äì241 =First Tactical Air Force= No. 10 OG's name was changed to First Tactical Air Force (No. 1 TAF) on 25 October 1944, ostensibly to emphasise \\"the formation's impressive size and ambitious purpose\\". Its complement of units was much greater than that typically assigned to RAAF groups, which were themselves considerably larger than USAAF \\"groups\\" that consisted of three or four squadrons.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 297‚Äì299 As the conflict gradually shifted further north, however, No. 1 TAF was relegated‚Äîin the absence of a Japanese air presence‚Äîto patrol, reconnaissance and some ground attack duties, including the Philippines campaign in 1944 and the Borneo campaign in 1945. By early 1945, there was widespread dissatisfaction among the fighter squadrons of No. 1 TAF due to its new focus on close air support duties. The underlying cause was the reluctance of the Allied Supreme Commander in the SWPA, Douglas MacArthur, to use non-American forces for the main advance towards Japan.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 109, 123‚Äì124 Air Commodore Cobby (left) and Group Captain Caldwell (right) pictured at Morotai in January 1945 Frustration was especially evident among highly experienced pilots, such as Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, who commanded No. 1 TAF's Spitfire squadrons. This led to a series of events known as the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\" in April 1945. Officers based at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, including Caldwell, protested the missions against what they saw as unimportant targets and tendered their resignations. Cobby was held responsible for the incident and eventually dismissed, being replaced by Air Commodore Scherger, who had recovered from his earlier injuries and who immediately set about restoring morale.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 207‚Äì215 He took over No. 1 TAF as Operation Oboe One, the Battle of Tarakan, was under way; the formation's airfield construction teams had been tasked with opening the runway on Tarakan Island within a week of Allied landings but extensive pre-invasion damage and adverse environmental conditions delayed this until the end of June. Poor planning on the RAAF's part was blamed on its earlier low morale and disruptions caused by the \\"Mutiny\\".Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 456‚Äì461 No. 1 TAF then participated in Operation Oboe Six, the Battle of North Borneo, where its performance was much improved.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 470‚Äì471 During July 1945, when the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign took place as Operation Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan, No. 1 TAF reached a strength of some 25,000 personnel, augmented by the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber squadrons of No. 82 Wing transferring in from North-Western Area Command. It was freed of garrison duties and had its strength reduced somewhat on 30 July, with the movement of units to the recently established No. 11 Group, which had been formed to command operations over the eastern islands of the Dutch East Indies and much of Borneo.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 477‚Äì479 Prior to the formation's disestablishment, No. 1 TAF units helped organise the medical treatment and repatriation of thousands of Australian prisoners-of-war.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 494‚Äì495 Group Captain Charles Read had taken over command from Scherger following the end of the Pacific War in August; by January 1946, No. 1 TAF numbered 1,400 personnel compared to its wartime peak of 22,000, and its remaining units were slated for imminent disbandment.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on August 23, 1998. Homer discovers he can make money by stealing and reselling grease, but eventually stops after negative encounters with Groundskeeper Willie and the Springfield Grease Company. Meanwhile, Lisa becomes jealous that a new student (voiced by Lisa Kudrow) is distracting all her friends by using her fashionable personality. The episode was written by Jane O'Brien and directed by Dominic Polcino. Plot After going back-to-school shopping, Homer Simpson learns from Apu Nahasapeemapetilon that he can sell grease to make a profit. At breakfast, Homer begins frying up various amounts of bacon to use the grease to make money and decides to have Bart help him with his \\"grease business\\" which forces Bart to quit school. Meanwhile, on the first day back at school, Lisa volunteers to help Alex Whitney, a fashion conscious new student, by showing her around the school. To help her make new friends, Lisa takes Alex, Sherri, Terri, Allison Taylor and Janey Powers for lunch in the cafeteria after the two groups meet up, but shortly after abandon Lisa after seeing that Alex owns sophisticated accessories like a cell phone, a purse, and perfume. Homer and Bart begin their grease business and make sixty-three cents worth of grease from twenty-seven dollars' worth of bacon, much to Homer's glee and Bart's disappointment. After Bart points out that they need larger amounts of grease, the pair drive to Krusty Burger, where they attempt to steal grease from the fryers. After loading it into Marge's car, two employees of The Acne Grease and Shovel Company steal it, claiming they control the grease and shoveling business in the city. Alex convinces Principal Skinner to have a school-dance rather than the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, accompanied by Sherri, Terri, Janey, and Allison, visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind and goes to the school to take tickets at the door. She is later forced to enter the dance hall, discovering the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults. Homer and Bart arrive at the school during the school-dance to steal the grease in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak inside and plant a hose in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and finds the hose, claiming the grease to be his retirement plan, and attempts to stop them inside the school vents; Willie grabs Homer's leg and strangles him with the hose sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age. Production Lisa Kudrow guest starred as Alex The episode originated from a conversation between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully about how girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters. The idea for the subplot came from Jace Richdale, who came up with Homer stealing grease for business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows. Cultural references The title of the episode is a play on the hymn and later Irish musical Lord of the Dance. Marge sings her own, altered version of the 1990 song \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\" when attempting to persuade Lisa to attend the dance. Much of the shop where the girls enter to buy clothes is based on Wet Seal. In the same mall is a party supply store, called Donner's Party Supplies which has a window sign saying \\"Winter Madness Sale\\", a reference to the Donner Party. Alex tells Lisa to not be \\"such a Phoebe\\", a reference to Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe Buffay on the series Friends. Reception \\"Lard of the Dance\\" finished 31st in the weekly ratings for the week of August 17‚Äì23, 1998 with a Nielsen rating of 7.2. It was the third highest rated show from the Fox Network that week. The episode aired during the summer so that it could serve as a lead-in for the early premieres of That '70s Show and Holding the Baby. While That '70s Show would receive higher Nielsen ratings than The Simpsons, Holding the Baby was a ratings flop. In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Lisa Kudrow's role as Alex as one of the sixteen great guest appearances on The Simpsons. Lisa Kudrow refers to herself in the episode, stating \\"Your name's Lisa? Shut up, I love that name!\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood commented that \\"The idea of Lisa being unpopular in the light of a new girl in the school hallways is not new (see \\"Lisa's Rival\\") but it is done here with such class,\\" concluding of Homer's treatment that \\"this is an episode which shows that even he can find interesting ways to do things.\\" Wesley Mead noted, in a review of the tenth season that the episode \\"might deal with familiar territory (\\"Lisa's Rival\\", anyone?), but it doesn't feel like a retread, and is also home to a superbly realised subplot that sees Homer and Bart go into the grease business.\\" In 2012, The New York Times highlighted this episode in an article about grease theft from restaurants: \\"An episode of The Simpsons from 1998 has Homer Simpson trying to make a quick buck selling grease, but for years, law enforcement authorities seemed unaware that fryer oil was being stolen by unlicensed haulers, causing millions of dollars' worth of losses each year for the rendering industry that collects and processes the grease.\\" References External links *\\"Lard of the Dance\\" at The Simpsons.com  The Simpsons (season 10) episodes 1998 American television episodes fi:Simpsonit (10. tuotantokausi)#Rasvaa (Lard of the Dance) ","title":"Lard of the Dance"},{"id":"1788395","title":"Josh Server"},{"id":"1788400","text":"The heads of Richard Wagner at the garden of the castle The Castle of P√∫bol or Gala Dal√≠ Castle House-Museum ( or Casa-Museu Castell Gala Dal√≠; or Casa-Museo Castillo Gala Dal√≠), located in P√∫bol in the comarca of Baix Empord√†, Girona, Catalonia, Spain, is a medieval building where the surrealist painter Salvador Dal√≠'s enormous creative efforts were focused on a single person, his wife Gala, with the aim of providing her with a unique sanctuary and resting place. In this sense, Gala is buried at the castle. Together with the Salvador Dal√≠ House Museum in Portlligat and the Dal√≠ Theater-Museum in Figueres, they form the Empord√† Dalinian triangle.Castell Gala Dal√≠ de P√∫bol (Catalan) Description The Castle of P√∫bol is a Gothic-Renaissance fortification that originated in the 11th century, located in the town of P√∫bol, in the municipality of La Pera, which became the center of the barony of P√∫bol. It is protected as a Cultural Good of National Interest by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia. P√∫bol Castle is located in the most pronounced area of the nucleus of La Pera, along with the church. It is formed by several bodies arranged around a patio, which retain much of the original structures and elements of the Gothic-Renaissance period. The main fa√ßade is the largest, and presents as a remarkable element, the midpoint archway with large stone voussoirs and gothic windows on the main floor. High elements (gothic and Renaissance windows, reliefs, portals with emblems, etc.) are also of interest, located in the various bodies of the building. The church of the castle is now the parish.Castle of P√∫bol and Church of the Castel (Catalan) The basic structure of the current building, with three floors articulated from a tall and narrow central courtyard, must be located during the period of maximum splendor of the barony of P√∫bol: second half of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century. In Gothic-Renaissance style, it has undergone many transformations. The architectural ensemble of the Castle is formed by the current parochial church, the fortified mansion-palace surrounded by a walled garden and the attached building known as a tithing. It is surrounded by houses protected by the remains of the medieval wall.DDAA. Casa-Museu Castell Gala Dal√≠ P√∫bol. Fundaci√≥ Gala-Salvador Dal√≠, 2011. . The Church of Sant Pere de P√∫bol was built between 1327 and 1341 in Gothic style. It has a single nave covered with pointed vault and closed by polygonal apse. At the southern wall, there are side chapels, one dedicated to the Virgin Mary, with sculptural decoration from the 15th century and the other from 1631. In the 17th century, the choir was added, and in 18th century, the sacristy was built. The frontispiece is centered on a cover and a latex rose window of late-Gothic style. At the top there is the bell tower. Until 1936, the church kept the Altarpiece of Sant Pere de P√∫bol by Bernat Martorell, currently at the Girona Art Museum.¬´Castell de P√∫bol¬ª.

(Catalan) History The castle is mentioned in a document from 1065 in which Gaufred Bastons ceded his power, together with that of Cervi√†, to the Counts of Barcelona. In the middle of the 14th century the castle was acquired by Arnau de Llers. Later on, the castle was owned by the Cervi√† family, and in 1370 by Jaspert de Campllong. The current castle and church were built around 1420, in the days of the lords of P√∫bol, named Corbera, whose shield is visible in various parts of the building. Subsequently, it was owned by several different families, the Oms, the Tormo, the Batlle and the Miquel, who later became the Marquises of Blondel de l'Estany. The castle building, although weakened by subsequent reforms, retains much of the inner structures of the 14th and 15th centuries.¬´Castell de P√∫bol¬ª.

Gala Dal√≠ Castle House-Museum Dal√≠ had promised to buy a castle to Gala. He considered several castles in the region and finally decided to buy her the Castle of P√∫bol, in 1969, then in a very poor state. Dal√≠ directed the restoration works, creating entirely the new decoration of the castle, and giving it his own personal touch. He offered Gala the castle where she would spend time every summer from 1971 to 1980. He also agreed not to visit there without getting advance permission from her in writing. After Gala's death in 1982, she was buried in the crypt that Dal√≠ had prepared for her final place of rest. Dal√≠ moved into the Castle for the first time the same year. He lived and worked there, finishing his last painting in 1983, until 1984, when a fire broke out in his bedroom \\"Dal√≠ Resting at Castle After Injury in Fire\\". The New York Times.

Dal√≠ planned to be buried at the crypt of the Castle of P√∫bol, near Gala, but he instead would be entombed at his final home. Gala's private castle in P√∫bol was opened to the public as the Gala Dal√≠ Castle House-Museum in 1996. It allows the visitor to discover a medieval building where Salvador Dal√≠ materialized his creative effort on his wife, Gala Dal√≠. Currently, it is managed by the Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation. Inside, it houses the paintings and drawings that Dal√≠ gave for Gala to exhibit at the castle, a collection of haute couture dresses, the furniture and numerous objects that decorated the castle, as well as the mausoleum of Gala. The garden is decorated with sculptures of elephants with long legs (a resource common in the artist's works), and the pool with busts of German composer Richard Wagner. The visitable areas are the Salon of the Shields, the Piano Hall, the Gala Room, the Gala Bath, the Library, the guest room, the attic, the dealer, the dining room, the exit, the tithes with the crypt, the garage, the garden and the pool.

It is a cocoa flavored version of Rice Krispies that contains real chocolate. The cereal was introduced in the United States in 1958. In 2003, the cereal was renamed Cocoa Rice Krispies, as Kellogg's endeavored to unite their Rice Krispies variations under a single marketing schema. In 2006, the name was changed back to Cocoa Krispies. Kellogg's has released variations of Cocoa Krispies such as Cocoa Krispies Cereal Straws, Cocoa Krispies Choconilla, and Chocos. Other markets Cocoa Krispies with milk The cereal is known as Choco Krispis in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, and Choco Krispies in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. It was introduced in the United Kingdom as Coco Pops in 1963, and is also known by that name in the Netherlands, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Bulgaria, Ghana, Malta, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Finland, Italy, Greece, Sweden, Belgium, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Ukraine, Botswana, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Australia, Turkey and Republic of Korea and as Choco Pops in France. Later in the 1960s, the name was changed to Coco Krispies, but subsequently reverted to Coco Pops. The cereal was available in Canada for a time, but was discontinued at some point in the early 1990s. Instead, Kellogg's sells a variant called Rice Krispies Cocoa, which is simply Rice Krispies with a light chocolate flavor.Rice Krispies Cocoa Cereal Several spin off cereals using the \\"Coco Pops\\" name, such as Caramel Flavoured Coco Pops, Coco Pops Crunchers, Coco Chex, Coco Rocks, Coco Pops Straws, Coco Pops Moon & Stars, Coco Pops Choc-N- Roll and Coco Pops Croc Prints (shaped like Crafty Croc's feet) have also been released by Kellogg's in some countries. A generic brand of coco pops Chocos were introduced in some countries as Coco Pops Mega Munchers. A chocolate flavor porridge variant had been available in the end of 2000s called Coco Pops Porridge, but didn't last long. Since 2014, they have been brought back. =United Kingdom= In February 1998, the British arm of Kellogg's renamed the brand in the country Choco Krispies, but sales quickly declined, and in the spring of 1999, telephone and internet poll with over one million voters found that 92% of voters wanted the name changed back to Coco Pops. Thus, Kellogg's reverted to the original name in May 1999. The advertising campaign for the poll featured Screaming Lord Sutch as the returning officer in a town hall election setting.http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/57359/coco-pops- back-vote  Mascots  Cocoa Krispies first appeared in the United States in 1958, represented by a monkey named Jose. He was reportedly replaced by Coco the Elephant in 1960 when Mexican-Americans complained about the ethnic stereotype. In 1963, the Hanna-Barbera character Snagglepuss took over as the mascot. Ogg the Caveman took over towards the end of 1967. By the end of 1973, Tusk the Elephant became the mascot of the cereal, and he remained until the end of 1982, when Snap, Crackle and Pop (the mascots of Rice Krispies) replaced and retired Tusk the Elephant. In 1991, the mascot became Coco the Monkey. In 2001, Snap, Crackle, and Pop returned and they have remained the product's mascots to date. The cereal was introduced in the United Kingdom under the \\"Coco Pops\\" name in 1961, with Mr. Jinks as the mascot. Later in the 1960s, Sweep (a dog hand puppet from the popular children's television programme The Sooty Show) became the mascot for Coco Pops. In 1986 Coco the Monkey was introduced, and he remains the mascot in those countries where the cereal is known as Coco Pops, Choco Krispies, and Choco Pops. In recent years, the design of Coco has been refined to give him a younger look. Coco's friends are Shortie Giraffe, Alan Anteater, Heftie Hippo, Ozmelda Ostrich, Kylie Kangaroo, and Rocky Raccoon, while Crafty Croc and the gorillas are his arch enemies. In 1989 the cereal introduced the mascot Simmo. It became popular quickly, with a short stint on the face of the merchandise and packaging for Cocoa Krispies. The Simmo mascot featured on various materials for around about three months. Simmo also starred in an advert for the company in 1986, alongside a female companion who only appeared once named \\"Heapo\\", a cartoon hippopotamus. More recent advertisements (2009) in the United Kingdom have opted away from using Coco and his friends, instead opting for things such as dancing milkmen and astronauts. Coco is still present on the box of the cereal and at the end of the advertisement, but is no longer the featured character. However, the cereal box of 2009 has Coco's head as the main feature, with the title 'Coco Pops' and a smaller cereal bowl, on the right of the box. Briefly, Coco was seen as a real-life chimp. As of 2011, Kellogg's decided to bring Coco and his friends, as well as Croc back, under a new space age style campaign, known as the \\"Coco Pops Promise\\". In those countries where the cereal is known as \\"Choco Krispis,\\" an elephant is the mascot. In 1986, Kelloggs named the elephant \\"Melvin\\". Recently, he has been called \\"Commando Melvin,\\" due to commercials featuring him as a space-faring fighter and adventurer, although this is due to a misunderstanding, as Commando Melvin refers exclusively to the organization featured in the commercials, whose purpose is to defend the \\"forti calcio plus\\", a supposed ingredient in the cereal from aliens or other such villains. In July 2014, in Mexico, due to concerns about the sugary and caloric contents of the cereal and the relation kids made with the friendly mascot, Melvin the elephant had a physical transformation from a traditional elephant body to an athletic body, resembling a strong teenager while keeping the head of the mascot. The cereal also had a recipe transformation to add more vitamins and minerals, in order to focus the product into a \\"health is fun\\" type of communication. In Australia, the mascot is Coco the Monkey. In June 2020, following the killing of George Floyd and as Black Lives Matter demonstrations were taking place around the world, former UK Member of Parliament Fiona Onasanya criticized Kellogg's use of a monkey on the box of brown, chocolate-flavoured Coco Pops whereas Rice Krispies featured Snap, Crackle and Pop, three white characters. A spokesperson for Kellogg's responded that \\"We do not tolerate discrimination.\\" Kellogg's also said that its founder, William Keith Kellogg, was \\"a pioneer in employing women in the workplace and reaching across cultural boundaries.\\" Onasanya pointed out that Kellogg's brother John Harvey Kellogg had founded the eugenics and racial hygiene organisation Race Betterment Foundation. Kellogg's was previously criticised over racially insensitive imagery in 2017 when author Saladin Ahmed noticed that a Corn Pops cereal box's only dark-skinned character was a janitor cleaning the floor. Health Coco Pops received one and a half (1.5) stars out of five on the Australian Government's health star ratings, primarily because of its high sugar content (listed as more than one third sugar). Kellogg's was criticized by health authorities in the United States and consumer experts in October 2009, when it unveiled a description on its boxes of Cocoa Krispies cereal that stated \\"now helps support your child's immunity\\".USA Today, Critics blast Kelloggs, Nov 2, 2009 Kellogg's responded that it didn't create the new copy to capitalize on the H1N1 virus concerns, but added \\"Kellogg developed this product in response to consumers expressing a need for more positive nutrition.\\" The FDA may yet rule on the Kellogg's claim and some observers responded negatively to Kellogg's marketing campaign. Compared to all claims on cereal boxes, \\"This one belongs in the hall of fame,\\" said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. \\"By their logic, you can spray vitamins on a pile of leaves, and it will boost immunity.\\"WFXT-TV, FoxBoston, Nov 2, 2009 There is concern that advertisements target children. LCM bars of the type advertised contain 30% sugar, which the advertisement failed to address.Coco Pops healthy? Yes, according to the food industry Advertisements by bus stops feature, \\"Ever thought of Coco Pops after school?\\" and parents fear children will want Coco Pops instead of healthier foods.

The first 3D installment in the series, its gameplay focuses on solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and completing various platforming sections. The story is set in 1947, after the events of Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix, and puts the eponymous protagonist, the adventurer Indiana Jones, against the Soviet Union. In a race for a mythological Babylonian power source, he joins forces with the Central Intelligence Agency and collects four pieces of the Infernal Machine, an ancient device that allegedly opens a portal to another dimension. The title was designed, written, and directed by Hal Barwood, who considered the Indiana Jones franchise a perfect fit for the action-adventure genre. Initially developed for the Microsoft Windows operating systems, the game later received an enhanced Nintendo 64 port jointly developed with Factor 5 released exclusively in North America, as well as a 2D version for the Game Boy Color created by HotGen. Infernal Machine received generally favorable reviews, having been praised for its detailed storyline and sophisticated level designs, though widely criticized for its unwieldy control scheme. Gameplay heads-up display in the bottom left corner is limited to a health indicator. Infernal Machine is an action-adventure and, as such, features a hybrid of various gameplay mechanics. The player sees Indiana Jones from a third-person perspective and controls him through 17 levels of a fully polygonal 3D world. A recurring element of Infernal Machine are platforming sections, for which a combination of running, jumping, climbing, and the use of the protagonist's trademark bullwhip is required. Furthermore, several human, animal and supernatural enemies are encountered during the course of the game, which the player can fight off with numerous firearms, the aforementioned whip, and a machete. In addition to these obstacles, the game largely focuses on solving puzzles and discovering treasures. Some levels include vehicle-themed portions such as rafting, jeep treks, and mine cart chases. The main objective of the game is to collect four machine parts in order to complete the titular Infernal Machine. Plot The story of the game is set in 1947 and depicts archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones returning to his digging career after his involvement in World War II. Sophia Hapgood, an old friend of Indiana and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency, visits him at his dig site in the Canyonlands, and informs him that the Soviets are excavating the ruins of Babylon. Led by Dr. Gennadi Volodnikov, a physicist interested in alternate dimensions, the Soviets' objective is to find a weapon more powerful than the nuclear bomb, giving them a decisive advantage in the Cold War. Sophia hires Indiana to investigate what exactly the Soviets are searching for, and he travels to their dig site in the Kingdom of Iraq. There, he joins up with Sophia's boss Simon Turner and finds out that Volodnikov is looking for the Babylonian god Marduk who lives on another plane called the Aetherium. Deep in the ruins of the Etemenanki, Indiana translates some ancient tablets with cuneiform writing explaining the true story behind the Tower of Babel: 2600 years ago, Nebuchadnezzar II was inspired by Marduk to build a great engine, but the frightened Babylonians tore the tower housing it down, leading four of the god's disciples to escape with some parts of this \\"Infernal Machine\\". Indiana embarks on a journey to find these machine parts before the Soviets do, and retrieves all four of them from a monastery in the mountains of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, an active volcano on Palawan in the Philippines, an Olmec valley in Mexico, and a tomb near Mero√´ in the deserts of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He is confronted by Volodnikov and Turner who both demand him to hand over the parts as they think they would not be safe with the other side. Untrusting of his fellow Americans, but opting for the lesser evil, he gives the parts to Sophia and Turner. Volodnikov says that it was probably better this way, as Marduk would have his revenge on those who desecrated the machine. Alarmed, Indiana travels back to the Room of the Tablets in Babylon, and finds a now-opened gate leading further into the ruins, to the core of the Infernal Machine. He catches up with Sophia and Turner, the latter of which intends to convince the other dimension to cooperate with the United States, and uses the machine parts to activate the engine. He pushes the unwilling Sophia into a mystical cage as a means of sending her to the Aetherium as an ambassador. Indiana sees no other way but to kill him to reclaim all parts and rescue her. However, the activated machine goes awry, and Indiana and Sophia are sucked into a portal that leads to the other dimension. There, he defeats the malevolent Marduk and frees Sophia from her cage. Having escaped back to Babylon, the team is greeted by Volodnikov, who is curious to find out if they encountered God on the other side, which Indiana denies. In the ensuing conversation, the Soviet doctor turns out to be a lot less extremist than assumed, and the three wander off into the sunrise in search of a good bottle of vodka. A bonus level sees Indiana return to the Peruvian temple from the opening of the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, and has him find another golden idol in a secret room. Development Each version of the game was developed around the same ideas. Indy begins his adventure in all three versions; PC, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Color, by sliding down a slope and proceeding to the character's right across the edge of a cliff. His weapons in all three versions also function in the same way. Infernal Machine project leader, designer and writer Hal Barwood always thought of Indiana Jones as an action hero. Based on this notion, he decided for the game to be an action-adventure, as he was particularly fond of the genre and its use of 3D worlds. Barwood also considered the Nazis to be overused as villains in the series and so instead set the title in the Cold War era with Russians as the antagonists. Originally, UFOs were planned to be used as a plot device, though George Lucas vetoed the idea, still reserving it for a then undeveloped fourth movie. In lieu thereof, Barwood became interested in ancient technology like the Antikythera mechanism, conceived the Infernal Machine as the MacGuffin, and placed it in the biblical Tower of Babel, which is believed to be identical with the Etemenanki, a temple dedicated to the god Marduk. Hal Barwood, who had previously worked on the LucasArts adventure game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, returned as project leader, designer and writer for Infernal Machine. Developed for Windows 95 and 98, the game uses a modified version of the Sith engine adapted for a third-person view by lead programmer Paul LeFevre. Eventually, lighting, collision, rendering and tools underwent drastic rewrites to the point that the code was renamed the Jones engine. The levels were principally designed by Steven Chen, and later conceptualized with illustrations by lead artist William Tiller. Multiplayer support was planned at the beginning of the development, but ultimately dropped because it turned out to be too complex to adequately test. Instead, more emphasis was put on the design of the single- player campaign with its puzzles and exploring aspect. The team implemented a hint system to lead players in the right direction. Additionally, the score system from previous Indiana Jones games, the Indy Quotient, makes a return. Apart from John Williams' \\"Raiders March\\", the soundtrack was newly composed by Clint Bajakian and consists of about 130 original pieces. Dubbed European language versions of the fully voice-acted game were released by THQ in Germany, Ubisoft in France, Electronic Arts in Spain and CTO in Italy. An intended PlayStation version was canceled early after the game's announcement. However, a team of eight Factor 5 employees teamed up with artists, level designers and a programmer from LucasArts to port Infernal Machine to the Nintendo 64. Development of this version commenced in early March 1999 and was finished in October 2000. Over the course of these 19 months, several improvements were made to the game, such as enhanced real-time lighting, controls, camera and particle systems, as well as added lock-on targeting and assigning items to three of the C buttons of the Nintendo 64 controller. Furthermore, the N64 version has some new musical pieces composed by Chris H√ºlsbeck, and employs sequenced music as opposed to the prerecorded audio from the PC original. The port was only released in North America and was exclusive to the Blockbuster chain of stores and the LucasArts Company Store. Electronic Arts planned to release it in Europe, but the title then saw a change of publisher to THQ. Originally scheduled for March 2001, the PAL version became subject to continuous monthly delays and was eventually canceled in September 2001. A 2D version of Infernal Machine with top-down perspective gameplay was developed for the Game Boy Color by HotGen also in early 2001. In October 2018, GOG.com re-released Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine as a downloadable game for personal computers. In November 2018, the game was released through Steam. Reception The PC version of Infernal Machine received generally favorable reviews with an average score of 73.60 percent at GameRankings. Although some critics found it to be too similar to Tomb Raider, the game was noted for setting itself apart from the aforementioned series due to being based on the Indiana Jones franchise, and relying more heavily on puzzle-solving. IGN commended the game for its intricate and intriguing storyline. Eurogamer shared the opinion and stated the plot to be \\"excellently woven\\", enhancing the feel of \\"being part of a big blockbuster movie\\". Computer and Video Games, Eurogamer, and IGN also praised Infernal Machine for its levels, calling them \\"excellently designed\\" and including \\"some of the most brilliant layouts [...] seen in a game of this type\\". While IGN thought the variety of puzzles provided was sufficient and applauded the inclusion of a hint system, GameSpot found many of the puzzles in the game to focus too heavily on platforming and went on to state that they become \\"quite repetitive - even predictable\\" after the first few levels. The most criticized aspect of the PC game across the majority of reviews, however, are the controls. Eurogamer described them as \\"infuriating at times\\", mostly due to their faulty collision detection when performing certain actions. GameSpot thought the control system was too jerky, unresponsive, and unnecessarily slow because of delays between the moves. Tom Russo reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Despite a fantastic storyline, the execution just doesn't merit a higher rating.\\" The graphics, while low on polygons, were received well for its detailed textures and the diverse locations presented. Eurogamer called Infernal Machine \\"one of the best looking third person adventures\\", and applauded the in-engine cutscenes, claiming them to be \\"bordering on film quality at times\\". GameSpot said the graphics were \\"not exactly cutting edge\\", but \\"generally quite good\\" due to the \\"fairly smooth and convincing\\" animations. IGN praised the environments for having \\"a lot more personality than the Tomb Raider series\\". Eurogamer called some of the locations \\"simply stunning\\", and GameSpot found the levels to be \\"aesthetically well designed because of convincing architecture and wall decorations\\". Furthermore, the soundtrack was stated by IGN to be \\"one of the best features of the game\\", based on its adding to the dramatic impact along the way. They applauded the voice recording for being \\"crisp and clean\\", though were disappointed with the sparsity of musical tracks and environmental sound effects. Allgame was impressed with the weapon effects and the foreign-language voice overs for the Soviet soldiers, while Computer and Video Games considered the lack of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones' voice disappointing, though understandable given his high salary. Eurogamer found the comments of the playable character to become annoying after a while, but were impressed with the ambient sounds and music, claiming the latter to be \\"ace stuff\\", \\"further enhancing the motion picture feeling of the game\\". Despite its enhancements, the Nintendo 64 version fared about as well with critics as the PC original, yielding 70.99 percent at GameRankings and a Metacritic score of 75 out of 100 points. The control scheme of the port was well received by IGN for the addition of C button item management and Z-targeting, both inspired by Ocarina of Time. Though they still considered the controls \\"slow\\" and \\"a little clunky\\", they commended them for being \\"more intuitive, tighter, speedier, and all around more balanced\\" than those of the PC version. GameSpot did not share these sentiments and stated the adaption of the keyboard controls to the console controller to be \\"rather clunky and unintuitive\\". IGN was impressed with the texture work and lighting, and found the title to be \\"one of the prettiest\\" on the Nintendo 64, even more so by employing the Expansion Pak to achieve high-resolution graphics. However, the graphics received criticism for its \\"wooden\\" character animations, occasional frame rate drops, and bugs such as pop-ups and faulty texture placement. IGN remarked that the sound was superior to the PC version's, while GameSpot thought it was about on par with the port's above-average graphics. Additionally, GameSpot criticized the Nintendo 64 version for the many bugs and lockups, a problem uncommon for console releases. HotGen's Game Boy Color version received an average score of 73.80 percent at GameRankings. It was panned by GameSpot for its backtracking, missing puzzle hints, and lack of plot development, but lauded for its clean animations and sound effects. Allgame was disappointed with the instruction manual being mandatory to understand the game's mostly non-existent plot, and criticized the decision to make the player restart a level upon dying, as well as the password system, calling it \\"annoying\\". Nintendo Power compared it to the N64 version saying it, \\"has almost as much depth as the recent N64 game and far fewer control problems.\\" But describing it more as a puzzle game. \\"You'll find all the areas that were in the N64 game, but each location has been recreated with its own challenge on GBC.\\" Further reading References External links * (via Internet Archive) * 1999 video games Action-adventure games Video games about ancient astronauts Cancelled PlayStation (console) games Game Boy Color games Infernal Machine Nintendo 64 games LucasArts games THQ games Sith (game engine) games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games developed in the United States Video games set in 1947 Video games set in Africa Video games set in Iraq Video games set in Kazakhstan Video games set in Mexico Video games set in Peru Video games set in the Philippines Video games set in Sudan Video games set in the United States Video games set in Utah Windows games Cold War video games Video games set in the Soviet Union ","title":"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine"},{"id":"1788435","text":"RMS Gaelic was a passenger and cargo liner built for the White Star Line.

The silver trout (Salvelinus agassizii) is an extinct char species or variety that inhabited a few waters in New Hampshire prior to 1939, when a biological survey conducted on the Connecticut watershed by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department found none. Description The silver trout was often a foot long and was said to actually be olive green in color. In the lakes silver trout inhabited, large quantities of the species appeared in October to spawn. Systematic position To formally describe the species and prevent local fishermen from overharvesting in the absence of bag limits, specimens were sent to Harvard and the U.S. National Museum for identification, where the fish was first described as a form of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and later as a variety of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). The silver trout was described as Salmo agassizii in 1885. W.C.Kendall, who published a famous monograph on New England chars in 1914, in turn concluded that the silver trout was related to the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Re-examining the 13 silver trout specimens in the U.S. National Museum by matching the markings on the dorsal fin and tail, the numbers of vertebrae, and the array of pelvic fin rays and gillrakers between different species, Robert J. Behnke concluded that the silver trout was most closely related to the brook trout, while the divergence was still concluded to be enough to place it outside of typical S. fontinalis. Behnke concluded the silver trout evolved from brook trout ancestors in New England lakes with deep, cold, clear, well-oxygenated depths as a planctivorous fish. Distribution The silver trout was an exceedingly rare fish, having become trapped by changed drainage systems in two New Hampshire lakes (Dublin/Monadnock Pond and Christine Lake in Stark) that were left as successors of Lake Hitchcock, a very large glacial lake that persisted for 4000 years where the silver trout probably evolved from brook trout. In the deep waters of these lakes, cut off from other species, the silver trout had no natural predators. Extinction By the late 19th century, as each lake developed its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen who sought to increase their catches began to introduce new fish species, and these eventually overwhelmed the native silver trout. Yellow perch, which eat trout eggs, and lake trout, which hold the same ecological niche, as well as eat and hybridize with other char species, were particularly devastating. Other species were also introduced that have proved to be devastating to native trout species in other waters, the rainbow trout, brown trout, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow smelt. While the silver trout is most likely lost, success stories like the Pyramid Lake (Nevada) Lahontan cutthroat trout and the Sunapee golden trout exist, and there may still be hope for the silver trout.

In carrots, it occurs in a concentration of approximately 2 mg/kg. As a toxin, it protects roots from fungal diseases, such as liquorice rot that causes black spots on the roots during storage. The compound requires the freezing condition to maintain well because it is sensitive to light and heat. Falcarinol was also credited for helping to prevent colon cancer. Chemistry Falcarinol is a polyyne with two carbon-carbon triple bonds and two double bonds. The double bond at the carbon 9 position has cis stereochemistry was introduced by the desaturation, which requires oxygen and NADPH (or NADH) cofactors, creates a bend in the molecule that prevent fatty acid from solidifying in oils and cellular membranes. It is structurally related to the oenanthotoxin and cicutoxin. Biological effects Falcarinol is an irritant that can cause allergic reactions and contact dermatitis. It was shown that falcarinol acts as a covalent cannabinoid receptor type 1 inverse agonist and blocks the effect of anandamide in keratinocytes, leading to pro-allergic effects in human skin. Normal consumption of carrots has no toxic effect in humans. Biosynthesis Starting with oleic acid (1), which possesses a cis double bond at the carbon 9 position from desaturation and a bound of phospholipids (-PL), a bifunctional desaturase/acetylnase system occurred with oxygen (a) to introduce the second cis double bond at the carbon 12 position to form linoleic acid (2). This step was then repeated to turn the cis double bond at the carbon 12 position into a triple bond (also called acetylenic bond) to form crepenynic acid (3). Crepenynic acid was reacted with oxygen (b) to form a second cis double bond at the carbon 14 position (conjugated position) leading to the formation of dehydrocrepenynic acid (4). Allylic isomerization (c) was responsible for the changes from the cis double bond at the carbon 14 position into the triple bond (5) and formation of the more favored trans (E) double bond at the carbon 17 position (6). Finally, after forming the intermediate (7) by decarboxylation (d), falcarinol (8) was produced by hydrolyzation (e) at the carbon 16 position that introduced the R conformation to the system.

Throughout its history, Korea has boasted numerous exceptional leaders who gained outstanding victories against numerically superior enemies. Famed leaders credited with defending Korea against foreign invasions include: Eulji Mundeok of Goguryeo, who defeated Sui China during the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War; Yeon Gaesomun of Goguryeo, who defeated Emperor Taizong of Tang China during the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War; \\"After the Tang dynasty succeeded the Sui, the second Tang emperor also tried to bring Goguryeo under its control, launching an unsuccessful attack in 645. Goguryeo repelled a second invasion in 662 with victories by the general Yeon Gaesomun.\\" Gang Gam-chan of Goryeo, who defeated the Khitan Empire during the Goryeo-Khitan War; \\"Later, in 1018, however, a third large-scale invasion from the Khitan was thwarted by Goryeo forces led by the general Gang Gamchan (948-1031). The Khitan thereafter gave up trying to subjugate Goryeo by force.\\" Choe Yeong and Yi Seong-gye of Goryeo, who defeated the Red Turbans, who later established Ming China, during the Red Turban Invasions; \\"Yi S≈èng-gye himself won advancement through his success in the numerous battles of his day. He played a major role in repulsing the attacks of the Red Turban bandits and Japanese marauders, as well as in the campaign against the Y√ºan Tung-ning Commandery in Manchuria.\\" and Yi Sun-shin of Joseon, who defeated the Japanese at sea during the Imjin War. Other notable leaders include: Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo, who created a great empire in Northeast Asia through conquest, and subjugated the other Korean kingdoms of Baekje, Silla and Gaya to bring about a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea; Geunchogo of Baekje, who captured Pyongyang and established overseas territories to control much of the Korean peninsula and dominate the seas; \\"Then, in 371, Paekche struck northward into the Kogury≈è domain as far as Py≈èngyang, killing the Kogury≈è king, Kogugw≈èn, in the course of the campaign. Paekche thus came to hold sway over a sizeable portion of the Korean Peninsula, including all the modern provinces of Ky≈ènggi, Ch'ungch'≈èng, and Ch≈èlla, as well as parts of Hwanghae and Kangw≈èn. Furthermore, King K≈≠n Ch'ogo solidified his international position by making overtures to the Eastern Chin state in the Yangtze river region and to the Wa people in Japan.\\" Munmu and Kim Yu-sin of Silla, who united the Three Kingdoms of Korea and defeated Tang China to gain complete control of the Korean peninsula; \\"In 674 and 675 Tang forces under Liu Rengui attacked Silla itself. Chinese histories record that Liu was victorious and forced the king of Silla to sue for peace, while Korean historians report the defeat of the Chinese armies. The fact that the Tang government found it necessary to withdraw the headquarters of its Korean protectorate to the Liao River valley in the early months of 676 suggests that the Korean version is probably closer to the truth. Silla was left in uncontested control of almost the whole of the Korean peninsula, and there was no great Tang campaign to recover what had been won with such difficulty and so quickly lost.\\" Dae Jo-yeong, who created Balhae from Goguryeo's ashes and reconquered Goguryeo lands lost during the Goguryeo-Tang War; Jang Bogo of Later Silla, who created a maritime empire and commanded a powerful fleet; \\"Using his official position and his immense military influence, Jang Bo-go amassed substantial wealth by controlling maritime trade between Silla, Tang and Japan. The famous American scholar of Asian history, Edwin O. Reischauer hailed Jang Bo-go as the trade prince of the maritime commerce empire. As Jang emerged as a formidable force in the sea, high- ranking officials in the Silla capital, Gyeongju, could no longer ignore him. Jang Bo-go ruled his domain with absolute political, military and economic autonomy.\\" Wang Geon, who united the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea and established Goryeo as the successor to Goguryeo; \\"General Wang K≈èn founded a new dynasty in 918. He named it Kory≈è, symbolizing that it was the successor to Kogury≈è.\\" and Yun Gwan of Goryeo, who defeated the Jurchens and constructed nine fortresses in Manchuria. Today, both North Korea and South Korea field some of the largest and most lethal armies in the world. On one hand, North Korea is widely suspected of having nuclear weapons, as well as other weapons of mass destruction. South Korea, for its part, is equipped with a sophisticated conventional military with state-of-the-art weapons. In addition, South Korean troops actively participated in the Vietnam War, contributing the second largest foreign military contingent after the United States, and are currently serving in various UN peacekeeping missions around the world. The South Korean military enjoys military alliances with other countries, particularly the United States.

It was nominated for the 2004 ENnies in the category Best Licensed Product. The game uses the d20 System with a variant magic system designed to reflect the powerful spells found in the series. Players' characters in this setting are frequently at a much higher level than in a typical d20 campaign. The game has no reference to any material found in the movies or OVA episodes due to licensing restrictions, thus there is no mention of the popular character Naga the Serpent. However, there are multiple sets of game statistics for the four principals of the TV series, to reflect their advancement over the course of the story. The book was scheduled to go out of print in 2006, as Guardians of Order's license to publish Slayers material expires. No renewal was planned, especially since CPM itself has been displaced as the license holder for Slayers in favor of FUNimation, which has a substantial collectible card game division of its own. Much of Slayers material was incorporated into Advanced d20 Magic, a setting-independent book that continued to be in print after the license on Slayers expired.

Each chapter or story involves a separate mystery that is solved through the interaction between the characters of Mr Satterthwaite, a socialite, and the eponymous Mr Quin who appears almost magically at the most opportune moments and disappears just as mysteriously. Satterthwaite is a small, observant man who is able to wrap up each mystery through the careful prodding and apposite questions of Quin, who serves as a catalyst each time the men meet. Plot summaries =The Coming of Mr Quin= It is New Year's Eve and a house party is taking place at Royston, the country house of Tom Evesham and his wife, Lady Laura. Among the guests are Mr Satterthwaite, Sir Richard Conway and Alex Portal and his Australian wife of two years, Eleanor. Satterthwaite finds her intriguing on many counts, especially why a blonde would dye her hair dark when the reverse is more common. After the clocks strike midnight, the older members among the guests mention Derek Capel, the previous owner of Royston, who committed suicide ten years previously, seemingly without reason. Tom Evesham stops this conversation and a few minutes later the women retire to bed. Left to their whisky and the fire, the men restart the conversation regarding Capel. There is a sudden knock on the door. It is a stranger; the lights through the stained glass above the door cast a multi-coloured look over his motoring clothes. Mr Harley Quin asks for shelter while his chauffeur repairs his broken-down car. He knows this part of the world and knew Derek Capel, and he skilfully steers the conversation round to the question of why Capel should suddenly take his own life. Satterthwaite feels that Quin's appearance on this night is no accident. As the discussion continues, Satterthwaite spots Eleanor Portal crouched down in the darkness at the top of the stairs listening in. Capel told the guests on the night of his death that he was about to be engaged. They assumed that it was to Marjorie Dilke. His secretiveness about the engagement makes Conway wonder if the engagement was to someone else, such as a married woman. All agree that Capel's manner that night was like a man who had won a large gamble and was defying the odds, yet ten minutes later he shot himself. A late post of letters and newspapers arrived, the first for several days in the snow-bound countryside, but Capel had not opened any of the letters. A policeman was at the house, returning one of Capel's dogs that had strayed. He was in the kitchen when the shot was fired. Quin asks them to place the exact date, possibly by reference to some event in the news, and the men remember it was the time of the Appleton murder trial. Mr Appleton was an old man who mistreated his far younger wife, and Capel was a friend of theirs. Appleton died by strychnine poisoning but the poison was only found after the body had been exhumed. His wife, who had smashed a decanter of port from which her husband had drunk ‚Äì perhaps to destroy the evidence ‚Äì had been put on trial and found not guilty, but had then left the country because of the scandal. Quin takes the men through the sequence of events: Capel saw the paragraph in the newspaper reporting that the exhumation order had been given; then he saw a policeman approaching his house. Not knowing that this visit was about the missing dog, he assumed that he was to be arrested, and so shot himself. His audience is stunned at the accusation that Capel was a murderer, objecting that he was not at the Appleton home on the day of the death; but Quin points out that strychnine is not soluble and would collect at the bottom of the decanter if placed there a week before. Why did Mrs Appleton smash the decanter? At Quin's prompting, Satterthwaite theorises it was to protect Capel, not to cover her own guilty tracks. Mr Quin leaves the house. Eleanor Portal follows him down the drive to say thank you, and then she and her husband are reconciled. Eleanor is the former Mrs Appleton. Capel's suicide left her unable to clear her name totally, until Quin's appearance. =The Shadow on the Glass= Mr Satterthwaite is a guest for a week at a house party held by Mr and Mrs Unkerton at their home, Greenway's House. Mr Richard Scott, there with his new wife Moira, is the best friend of another guest, Major John Porter. Both men are big-game hunters. Mrs Iris Staverton arrives. Rumour says she had a relationship in Africa with Richard Scott. Also present is Lady Cynthia Drage, a gossipy society woman, and the popular, young Captain Jimmy Allenson, and whom Lady Cynthia met in Egypt the previous year ‚Äì where the Scotts met and married. The house is said to be haunted by the ghost of a cavalier who was killed by his wife's roundhead lover. The two fled the house but, looking back, saw the image of the cavalier looking at them from an upstairs window. The glass has been replaced many times but the image always returns on the new pane. The Scotts stay in this room, with the offending window panelled over. Satterthwaite shows this window to Major Porter from a grassy knoll some distance from the house where the image is clear. Major Porter confides to Satterthwaite that Mrs Staverton ought not to have come to the party. Returning, they overhear Mrs Staverton telling Richard Scott that he will be sorry, and that jealousy can drive a man to murder. That evening, Mrs Unkerton tells Satterthwaite that she has sent for a glazier to replace the haunted pane of glass. Satterthwaite realises that she senses the tension in the house. The next evening, Satterthwaite and Porter retrace their steps in the dusk to the grassy knoll and conclude that the glass is not yet replaced, as the cavalier's image is still there. Returning, they hear two gunshots, and find Mrs Staverton at the privy garden holding a gun and two dead people on the ground ‚Äì Captain Allenson, shot in the chest, and Mrs Scott, shot in the back. Mrs Staverton says that she arrived in the garden and picked up the discarded gun. While the police are fetched, Satterthwaite notices a spot of blood on the earlobe of Mrs Scott and sees that one of her earrings has been torn away. The situation looks bad for Mrs Staverton in the eyes of the police. In the middle of the enquiry, Mr Quin arrives. Satterthwaite describes his ability to help people see problems from new angles. Prompted by Quin, Satterthwaite points out the torn earlobe, which leads to a new analysis of the gunshots. The first bullet passed through Moira into Allenson, in an embrace. The second bullet hit her ear. The Scotts met in Cairo the previous winter when Allenson was there ‚Äì were Mrs Scott and Allenson lovers? Unkerton reveals that the glazier did visit that morning. Next to the window, they find a small feather that matches one of Mrs Scott's hats. Quin describes the crime ‚Äì Richard Scott pulled the movable panel back, knowing the house well, and then saw his wife and her lover in the garden. He posed like the storied cavalier, donning his wife's hat to complete the profile. He shot the two from the window and then threw the pistol onto the grass below. He was happy to let Mrs Staverton take the blame. Contrary to rumour, she fell for Porter in Africa, not Scott. Porter did not realise this, and Quin suggests he comfort the wrongly accused lady. =At the \\"Bells and Motley\\"= Satterthwaite is held up one night in the village of Kirklington Mallet when his car needs repairs. At the local pub, the \\"Bells and Motley\\", he is delighted to find Mr Quin in the coffee room. The stormy weather reminds the landlord of a local story, as it stormed the night that Captain Harwell came back with his bride. Satterthwaite knows this news story and sees this has brought him here to meet Quin. They will talk over the mystery and solve it. Just over a year earlier, the large local house, Ashley Grange, was bought by Miss Eleanor Le Couteau, a rich young French Canadian, with a taste for collecting and for the hunt. Captain Richard Harwell stayed at the inn to take part in a fox hunt. Miss Le Couteau fell for him; two months later they were engaged, and after three months they married. After a two-week honeymoon they returned to Ashley Grange on that stormy night. Early the next morning, the Captain disappeared, seen only by their gardener, John Mathias. Suspicion fell on Stephen Grant, a young lad in Harwell's employ, but recently discharged. Nothing could be proved against him. Captain Harwell has no family, no past life that police could find. His heartbroken wife sold the Grange and all its fine contents, jewellery included, to an American millionaire to settle on the continent. The rheumatic gardener John Mathias was also suspected. His wife was the cook for the couple. He returned to their cottage twenty-five minutes after the Captain left the house, which was time enough to dispose of the body, but there is no body found. The couple left the area. Quin prompts Satterthwaite to assess the news events of the time from a long view. Satterthwaite says crossword puzzles and cat burglars. In France, there were many unsolved thefts, including one of a collection of jewels from a French ch√¢teau. The chief suspects are the Clondinis, a family of three acrobats. They talk of Harwell's disappearance as being like a conjuring trick to divert public attention from what is really happening. In the case of Harwell, could the sale for cash of the Grange and all its contents have been the real trick played, and Harwell's disappearance the diversion? Quin points out that Miss Le Couteau's past is as little known as that of Harwell, and she, her husband, and Mrs Mathias could easily be the Clondinis in disguise, staging this elaborate laundering of the proceeds of their crime. Mathias and Harwell were never seen together. An examination of the fine items in the house could provide proof, if they matched those stolen in France. Satterthwaite agrees to set the wheels in motion. Mary Jones, serving at the \\"Bells and Motley\\", in love with Stephen Grant, has a good surprise coming to her. =The Sign in the Sky= Mr Satterthwaite is attending a newsworthy trial at the Old Bailey. On the final day he hears the sentence of death against a gentleman. He eats at the expensive Arlecchino restaurant in Soho where he finds Mr Quin sitting at a table, and tells him the verdict. As Quin has not followed the trial, Satterthwaite relates the evidence. Lady Vivien Barnaby felt trapped in her marriage with her older husband, Sir George Barnaby, a man of Satterthwaite's acquaintance. Satterthwaite describes Sir George as a fussy man of fixed habits who himself rewinds the clocks in the house every Friday. She makes advances to Martin Wylde, a gentleman farmer. Wylde did enter into an affair with Lady Barnaby, but at the same time was involved in a relationship with Sylvia Dale, the daughter of the local doctor. On the morning of Friday the 13th Lady Barnaby sent him a letter, begging him to come to her house at Deering Hill that evening at six o'clock, when her husband would be out at a bridge game. Wylde came to the house, leaving fingerprints in the room where, at 6:20 pm, Lady Barnaby was killed with a single blast from a shotgun. The servants heard the shot and rushed to the room, finding their dead mistress. They tried contacting the police, but found that the phone was out of order. One of them went on foot and met Sir George returning from his game. All of the parties involved had alibis ‚Äì Sir George left his game at 6:30 pm, Sylvia Dale was at the station seeing a friend off on the 6:28 pm train, and Sir George's secretary, Henry Thompson, was in London on business. Wylde admitted that he took his gun to Deering Hill, but stated that he left it outside the door and forgot it when he left the house, after a scene with Lady Barnaby. He left the house at 6:15 pm. He took a longer than usual time to reach his home, but his reason was not believed. Quin asks about the housemaid who gave evidence at the inquest but not at the trial, and Satterthwaite tells him that she has gone to Canada. Satterthwaite wonders if he should interview her. Satterthwaite tracks the maid, Louise Bullard, to Banff and takes the ocean voyage to Canada, and the train to Banff, where he finds her working in a hotel. She speaks of seeing the shape of a giant hand in the sky caused by the smoke of a passing train at the very time she heard the shot. She does tell Satterthwaite that Henry Thompson suggested the post in Canada to her, with its high wages, and she had to leave quickly to take it, as well as refrain from letters to her friends at Deering Hill. Satterthwaite returns to England, meeting Quin in the Arlecchino restaurant. Satterthwaite feels he has no useful evidence, but Quin points out the train smoke that she saw. Trains use the line only at ten minutes to the hour and twenty-eight minutes past; therefore the shot could not have been fired at 6:20 pm. Satterthwaite realises that Sir George put the clocks back by ten minutes to give himself an alibi; he had intercepted his wife's note that morning. He put the telephone out of order to prevent the police from logging an emergency call against a specific time. Having heard the maid's story of the sign in the sky, he realised that she alone had evidence that could smash his alibi, and so got his secretary to get her out of the country. Quin suggests Satterthwaite take this evidence to Sylvia Dale who has remained loyal to Wylde. Satterthwaite and she take a taxi to Sir George, where she extracts a signed confession from him to bring to the police. She said the police already knew of Louise Bullard's story, which rattled him enough to confess before the sentence on Wylde was carried out. =The Soul of the Croupier= Mr Satterthwaite is spending the first few months of the year in Monte Carlo. He is cheered by the sight of the Countess Czarnova. She has been coming there for years, sometimes in the company of royalty and titled people, rumoured to be the lover of the king of Bosnia. Her companion is a young mid-western American man, Franklin Rudge, who is enraptured with her. Satterthwaite sees another of Rudge's party, Elizabeth Martin, who has none of the other woman's sophistication but is not innocent or na√Øve. She confides in Satterthwaite her misgivings concerning the Countess and Rudge. She leaves, and then Rudge joins Satterthwaite. He is enjoying his tour of Europe. He speaks of the Countess: he praises the woman herself and the exotic life she has led. Satterthwaite is more dubious of the tales she tells of her adventures in diplomatic intrigues. Soon afterwards the Countess joins them. After Rudge has gone, Satterthwaite receives the impression that he is being warned off by the Countess. She means to have Rudge and she perceives Satterthwaite as an impediment to her plans. He is puzzled as to why she pursues the young American when she appears to have everything that she desires, with her fine clothes and exquisite jewels. Satterthwaite is delighted to receive his old friend, Harley Quin. Satterthwaite tells Quin of the relationships he is observing; the Countess, for reasons best known to her, is coming between Franklin Rudge and Elizabeth Martin. The following night at the casino the Countess wears a simple white gown and no jewelry, and a younger woman is rumoured to be the lover of the king of Bosnia. The Countess wagers all she has at the roulette table. As Satterthwaite bets on 5, she bets on 6. The ball lands on 5 but the croupier passes the winnings to the Countess. Satterthwaite accepts the croupier's decision. Quin commiserates with him and invites him to a supper party that night at a bohemian caf√© called La Caveau, with candle light. Each guest is to bring the first person he sees to the supper party. Satterthwaite arrives with Elizabeth. Rudge arrives with the Countess while Quin brings the casino's croupier Pierre Vaucher. Vaucher tells the story of a jeweller who worked in Paris many years ago who, despite being engaged, fell for a half-starved girl and married her. His family disowned him, and over the next two years he realised what a mistake he had made, as the woman made his life a misery and left him. She reappeared two years later, dressed in rich clothes and fabulous jewels, and he asked if she was coming back to him. She left again and the man sank further into drunkenness, eventually saved by the discipline of the army during the First World War. The man eventually became a croupier at a casino and saw her, in a reduced state ‚Äì as her jewels were paste replicas to his trained eye, and she was again on the edge of destitution. He passed another man's winnings to her. At this point in the story, the Countess jumps up and cries, \\"Why?\\" Vaucher smiles and replies that it was pity that made him do it. She offers to light his cigarette, using a spill to do so. She leaves and Vaucher realises that the spill is the fifty thousand franc note, her winnings and all she has in the world. Too proud to accept charity, she burnt it in front of his eyes. Vaucher follows her. Rudge realizes he does not understand the Countess and turns his attentions back to Elizabeth. Quin and Satterthwaite are satisfied. =The Man from the Sea= Mr Satterthwaite is on holiday on a Spanish island. He often goes to the garden of a villa called La Paz, which stands on a high cliff overlooking the sea. He loves the garden but the villa, which is shuttered and seems empty, intrigues him. After exchanging pleasantries with the gardener, Satterthwaite makes his way to the cliff edge and soon hears approaching footsteps. It is a young man in his eyes, a man of forty. The man says he expected to be alone. He tells Satterthwaite that he came here the previous night and found someone there seemingly in fancy dress, in \\"a kind of Harlequin rig\\". Satterthwaite is surprised at this mention of his old friend and tells his new acquaintance that Mr Quin's appearances usually presage revelations and discoveries. The younger man comments that his appearance seemed very sudden, as if he came from the sea. Anthony Cosden introduces himself and tells Satterthwaite of his life; he has been told that he has six months to live. He visited the island about twenty years before, and makes clear he wants to die here by leaping off the cliff. Satterthwaite asks, \\"You will not do it tonight, to spare me suspicion of pushing you?\\" Cosden agrees. Satterthwaite makes the case for living, but Cosden is resolute. Cosden leaves and Satterthwaite approaches the villa. Pulling open one of the closed shutters, he sees a troubled woman in traditional Spanish dress looking at him. He stammers an apology which makes the woman realise that he is English, and she calls him back. She, too, is English, and she invites him into the house for tea as she wishes to talk to someone. She unburdens herself to Satterthwaite, telling him that she has lived here for the last twenty-three years, for all but the first year as a widow. She married an Englishman when she was eighteen and they moved into the villa. The marriage proved to be a dreadful mistake as her husband gloried in making her miserable, and their baby was stillborn. Some girls staying in the local hotel dared him to swim in the dangerous sea at the base of the cliff. He drowned and his body was battered against the rocks as his wife watched. Soon afterwards, she had a brief affair with a young Englishman who was visiting the island, the result of which was a son. He is now grown up and happy. He is serious about a girl whose parents want to know his antecedents, and she has never told him he is illegitimate. To save him pain and scandal, she is planning to commit suicide to hide the truth from him forever. Again, Satterthwaite finds himself persuading someone to live. He asks her to take no action for twenty-four hours, but to leave the shutter he opened unlatched and to wait there tonight. He returns to the hotel, finds Cosden, and refers obliquely to the shutter on the villa that he opened. Cosden understands his meaning and leaves. The next day Satterthwaite returns to La Paz and finds the Englishwoman there, her appearance transformed with happiness. She and Cosden, reunited after twenty years, are to be married that day by the Consul, and she will introduce her son to his father. She refuses to believe that Cosden will die. She will make sure he lives. Satterthwaite walks to the cliff top and is not surprised to find Quin there. Quin tells him that the man who drowned in the sea twenty years ago truly loved his wife ‚Äì almost to the point of madness ‚Äì and the desire to make amends for past transgressions can sometimes be so strong that a messenger can be found. As Satterthwaite leaves, Quin walks back towards the cliff edge, disappearing from view. =The Voice in the Dark= Mr Satterthwaite is on the French Riviera at Cannes with Lady Barbara Stranleigh, someone he has known since his youth. She is \\"beautiful, unscrupulous, completely callous, interested solely in herself.\\" She came into her family title of baroness after the deaths of the last Lord Stranleigh's two brothers and his only nephew, the tragic death of her elder sister Beatrice in the shipwreck of the Uralia off the coast of New Zealand, and then the death of Lord Stranleigh. Lady Stranleigh asks Satterthwaite to check on her daughter, Margery, as he is returning to England. Lately she reports hearing voices in the night at Abbot's Mede in Wiltshire. Margery is seeking psychic researchers and Satterthwaite knows how to handle them. On the train home, Satterthwaite meets Mr Quin. Quin tells him that he will be at the \\"Bells and Motley\\" inn where Satterthwaite can call on him. At Abbot's Mede, Margery tells Satterthwaite that she hears \\"Give back what is not yours. Give back what you have stolen.\\" She switches on the light, but she is alone. The long time servant Clayton sleeps in the next room now, but she has not heard the voices when Margery does. The night before he arrived, Margery dreamt that a spike was entering her throat and the voice murmured, \\"You have stolen what is mine. This is death!\\" Margery screamed and found a mark on her neck‚Äîno dream. Satterthwaite speaks with Clayton, a blue-eyed, grey-haired woman who also survived the Uralia, who is alarmed at the events of last night. Margery's friend Marcia Keane and a family cousin Roley Vavasour have been staying at the house since the voices started. Lady Stranleigh writes to thank Margery for the chocolates she sent and tells her that she has been laid low by food poisoning. Margery tells Satterthwaite she did not send her mother chocolates, but neither she nor her mother make the connection that Satterthwaite does, that the mysterious chocolates are the source of the food poisoning. Roley organizes a s√©ance, with the spiritualist Mrs Casson and the medium Mrs Lloyd. After speaking to the medium's spirit guide, the voice of Lady Stranleigh's sister Beatrice comes through. Satterthwaite tries her with a question from long ago that only she will know, and she answers correctly. The spirit of Beatrice says \\"Give back what is not yours.\\" Roley is the next heir to the title and estates should Lady Stranleigh die. He has asked Margery to marry him but she has refused, being engaged to the local curate. Lady Stranleigh wires that she is arriving home early, so Satterthwaite returns to London. Once there, he learns that Lady Stranleigh was found dead in her bath at Abbot's Mede. He returns to Wiltshire but stops at the \\"Bells and Motley\\" where he finds Mr Quin. His friend listens to the entire tale but tells Satterthwaite that he has solved these matters himself before when he is in full possession of the facts, and he can do so now. In Abbot's Mede, the sad Margery is drawing up a new will and asks him to be the second witness, Clayton being the first. Alice Clayton, her full name, reminds Satterthwaite she is the same maid who, many years earlier, he had kissed in a hotel's passage. He remembers Alice had brown eyes. He tells Margery that the woman she knows as Clayton, with blue eyes, is her Aunt Beatrice. She has a scar where she was struck on the head during the sinking of the Uralia and he imagines this blow destroyed her memory at the time. Her avaricious sister used the opportunity to say her elder sister drowned so she might inherit the family money. It is only now that Beatrice's memory is returning, thus persecuting her niece, and then killing her younger sister. The two go to Clayton's room but find the woman dead from heart failure. As Satterthwaite says, \\"Perhaps it is best that way.\\" =The Face of Helen= Mr Satterthwaite is at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Not caring for Cavalleria Rusticana, he deliberately arrives late so as to see only Pagliacci. He arrives just before the interval, when he bumps into Mr Quin. He invites Quin to watch the second opera with him in his private box, from where they spot an absolutely beautiful-looking girl in the stalls before the lights go down. In the next interval they spot the girl sitting with an earnest-looking young man, and see that they are joined by another young man whose arrival appears to have generated some tension in the group. At the end of the evening Satterthwaite makes his own way to where his chauffeur-driven car is parked when he again sees the three people from the Opera House. Almost immediately a fight breaks out between the two young men and Satterthwaite rescues the girl from the fracas. At her home, she tells him her name is Gillian West, the intense man is Philip Eastney, and the other is Charlie Burns; and she hopes that Eastney has not hurt Burns. Satterthwaite promises to find out and assuage her fears. The next Sunday, Satterthwaite is in Kew Gardens when his path again crosses that of Gillian West and Charlie Burns, and he finds that the two have just become engaged. Gillian is nervous of the effect the news will have on Philip Eastney, and Charlie confides that, in the past, men have lost their heads over his fianc√©e and done stupid things as a result. The next Thursday, Satterthwaite goes back to Chelsea at Gillian's invitation and has tea with her. To her relief, Eastney has accepted the news with good grace and given her two wedding presents. One is a new radio and the other is an unusual glass sculpture which is topped off by a bubble-like iridescent ball. Eastney has also made a strange request ‚Äì that Gillian stay at home tonight and listen to the broadcast of music on the radio. Satterthwaite is uneasy as he leaves Gillian, feeling that the appearance of Quin at Covent Garden must mean that there is unusual business afoot, but he cannot place exactly what is going to happen. Wanting to discuss his fears with Quin, he goes to the Arlecchino restaurant where he met him once before (see: The Sign in the Sky). Quin is not there, but Eastney is, and the two men talk ‚Äì the younger man regaling Satterthwaite with tales of working in the testing and manufacture of poison gas during the war. Leaving the restaurant, Satterthwaite is still uneasy. He buys a paper for that evening's radio programmes and realises that Gillian West is in great danger. He rushes to her flat and drags her out before the tenor's voice reaches a peak during a performance of \\"The Shepherd's Song\\". A stray cat goes through the door to the flat and is found dead ‚Äì killed by the gasses freed from the glass ball when it shattered as a result of the tenor singing. Satterthwaite meets Eastney who is pacing on the Chelsea Embankment and tells him that he and Gillian removed a dead cat from the flat, i.e. that Eastney's plan failed. The two men part, and a few minutes later a policeman asks Satterthwaite if he also heard what seemed like the sound of a large splash. The police officer figures it is another person committing suicide. =The Dead Harlequin= Mr Satterthwaite attends a showing at an art gallery by the rising young artist Frank Bristow. There he sees a painting called \\"The Dead Harlequin\\" which portrays a dead figure on a floor, and the same figure looking in through an open window at his own corpse. The man portrayed is Mr Harley Quin and the room shown is the Terrace Room at Charnley, a house owned by Lord Charnley which Satterthwaite has visited. He buys the picture and meets the artist, whom he invites for dinner that night at his house. The artist joins Satterthwaite and Colonel Monkton who was at Charnley the night fourteen years earlier when the previous Lord Charnley committed suicide. The house has a ghostly history, with the spectre of Charles I walking headless on the terrace and a weeping lady with a silver ewer seen whenever there is a tragedy in the family. The last death occurred at a fancy dress ball to celebrate the return from honeymoon of Lord Charnley and his new bride. Colonel Monkton was one of several people who stood at the top of a flight of stairs and saw Lord Charnley pass below. A woman called out to him but he walked on as if in a daze. He passed through the Terrace Room and into the Oak Parlour that leads off it. Legends attached to the Oak Parlour include one of Charles I hiding in a priest hole there; duels taking place, with the bullet holes still in the wall; and a strange stain on the floor which reappears even when the wood is replaced. The people on the stairs heard the door lock behind him and then a shot. They could not get into the Oak Parlour so they broke the door down to find the body with curiously little blood coming from it. Alix, Lord Charnley's widow, was pregnant and when their son was born, he automatically inherited, so no others gained by this death. Satterthwaite receives an unexpected guest ‚Äì Aspasia Glen, the celebrated performer. She wants to buy \\"The Dead Harlequin\\". Satterthwaite is pleased when Alix Charnley telephones him part way through their conversation, also wanting to buy the picture. Satterthwaite asks Alix Charnley to come round to the house immediately. He introduces Miss Glen to his other guests and is not surprised to see that Mr Quin has arrived. When Alix joins them, she recognises Miss Glen. They relive that dreadful night and now, after fourteen years, Alix reveals that the reason for the suicide was a letter Lord Charnley received from a guest telling him that she was pregnant by him ‚Äì just a month after his marriage to Alix. Monkton thinks that explains all, but Satterthwaite wants to know why Bristow's picture portrays the dead figure in the Terrace Room and not in the Oak Parlour. This suicide may be a murder. He thinks the death occurred there and the body was put in the Oak Parlour afterwards. Satterthwaite points out that the figure seen in fancy dress could have been anyone. The only person who called him \\"Lord Charnley\\" was the woman who was allegedly pregnant by him, Monica Ford, in league with Hugo Charnley, hoping to be the Lord himself. A shot fired in the locked room would be just another bullet hole in the wall like those created by past duels, and there is a priest hole to hide the person just seen entering the room. Any bloodstain on the floor of the Terrace Room would have been covered by a red Bokhara rug which was placed there on that night only, and the body then moved into the Oak Parlour. The stains could have been cleaned up by a lady with a jug and basin and if anyone saw her, she would have been taken for the resident ghost. Satterthwaite accuses and Alix recognises Miss Glen as Monica Ford who called out Lord Charnley's name that night. The accused woman rushes out of Satterthwaite's house after confessing that she loved Hugo, and helped him with the murder, but he abandoned her soon after and is dead now. Alix is relieved, coming alive again. The letter to her husband was false. She can tell her son that his father has no stain on his reputation. When the artist prepares to leave, Mr Quin has already slipped away. Frank Bristow may pursue the charming Alix. =The Bird with the Broken Wing= Mr Satterthwaite longs to return to the comforts of his London home, when the other guests spell out the results of their table-turning as QUIN followed by LAIDELL. He reverses his view, and calls hostess Madge Keeley to resurrect his invitation to Laidell, another house party in the country. Arriving at Laidell, he learns that Madge is soon to announce her engagement. She quietly points out Roger Graham to him at dinner. David Keeley, a brilliant mathematician but socially quiet man affectionately called the invisible man, is Madge's father. Among the guests are Roger's mother Mrs Graham, Doris Coles and Mabelle and Gerard Annesley. Mabelle strikes Satterthwaite as \\"The Bird with the Broken Wing\\". He notices that Roger seems distracted, and later hears from Mabelle that earlier in the day she saw a figure in the woods who could only have been Mr Quin. Taking this as his cue to speak with her, he finds out that she is blissfully happy. Gerard fetches her to play for the group on her ukulele. The party breaks up for the night, heading to their respective rooms. In the morning, the household wakes to the news that Mabelle is dead, found by a maid hanging on the back of her bedroom door. The police arrive. Inspector Winkfield conducts the investigation, an old acquaintance of Satterthwaite. The night before, Madge prompted Mabelle to fetch her ukulele from the drawing room, and that is the last that anyone saw her. Gerard Annesley fell asleep in his adjoining room before he heard his wife return, hearing no sounds in the night. Mr Satterthwaite insists that she did not kill herself but was murdered. The inspector questions him alone, confirms his suspicions, and asks for his help. The rope which they found around her neck was much thicker than the marks of the cord that killed her. Thinking carefully, Satterthwaite remembers seeing smoke coming from under Mrs Graham's door. He investigates the cause. He finds some incompletely burnt letters in the grate; there are enough fragments to show they are from Mabelle to Roger about an affair between them. He confronts Mrs Graham, who admits that she burnt them to prevent trouble for her engaged son. Roger says he did not kill Mabelle, and admits he had been bewitched by her, but had not told her it was ended last night. Satterthwaite finds Mabelle's ukulele and strums it. It is out of tune; Doris tunes it, but breaks the string, noticing it is an A-string, one size too large. Satterthwaite suddenly realises that the murder was committed with the original string, and confronts quiet David Keeley in the library. He was the last person downstairs, switching off the lights as Mabelle returned for her instrument. He quickly killed her and then later in the night returned to move the body to her own room. Why did he do it? Laughing insanely about how no one notices him, Keeley admits the crime as Winkfield walks into the room. Satterthwaite meets Quin on the train home. He sadly admits he failed to prevent Mabelle's death. Quin replies that he did save the two young men from being wrongly accused of the crime, and asks if there are not greater evils than death. Satterthwaite closes his eyes, thinking of Mabelle, and when he opens his eyes, Mr Quin has already gone; but there is a bird carved from a blue stone where Quin had been seated, an enchanting piece of art. =The World's End= Mr Satterthwaite is in Corsica with the Duchess of Leith, a strong and generous woman who can be miserly on the small expenses. At their first meal, the duchess spots Naomi Carlton Smith, a young artist who is a cousin to her. She was involved with a young writer who, the year before, was accused of stealing jewellery and imprisoned. Mr Satterthwaite likes her art, and buys a drawing from her. The three arrange a picnic for the next day with a fourth person, Mr Tomlinson, who has a car. At the appointed time they drive up into the mountains and eventually stop where the road finishes at an isolated coastal village of the name of Coti-Chiavari, which Naomi Smith terms \\"the World's End\\". There, Satterthwaite is delighted to see Mr Quin sitting on a boulder and looking out to sea. He has a feeling that Quin has turned up \\"in the nick of time\\". The group has brought a picnic with them, but as it is starting to snow they find a rough stone shelter wherein they find three other visitors from England: Vyse, the theatrical producer, Rosina Nunn the famous actress and her husband, Mr Judd. They are also enjoying a picnic and the two parties settle down to eat. During the conversation that ensues, Miss Nunn admits to her constant habit of being absentminded and the occasion she lost her opal to a thief. The thief was Alec Gerard, a young playwright, who took it from her when she showed it to him at the theatre. Although the jewel was not found on him, he was unable to satisfactorily account for a large sum of money that appeared in his bank account the next day. Mr Quin comes to the shelter to keep Miss Smith part of the group; he will not let her wander off alone. Miss Nunn has cause to empty her bag; from it comes a wooden box that Mr Tomlinson recognises as an Indian Box. Realising that no one knows the true nature of such an item, Tomlinson shows the group how the box contains a secret compartment and the movements to both hide and recover a small item. They are all startled when the missing opal falls from the box. Miss Nunn understands immediately that she must undo the wrong done to Gerard. With her lover vindicated, Naomi Smith is relieved, and no longer threatens to kill herself. Satterthwaite and Quin again bid each other goodbye at the cliff's edge. =Harlequin's Lane= Mr Satterthwaite has accepted an invitation to stay at the country house of a couple called Denham. They are not part of his usual circles of friends, but they have an appeal. John Denham is forty and he rescued his wife, Anna, from the Russian revolution. The couple are out when he arrives, so Mr Satterthwaite passes the time by going for a walk in the garden. He progresses to a lane called \\"Harlequin's Lane\\" that borders the grounds. He is not surprised to meet Quin, whom he finds is also staying with the Denhams. They walk down the lane, known locally as \\"Lover's Lane\\", to its termination, a former quarry which is now a rubbish tip. Returning to the house they meet a young girl in the lane called Molly Stanwell who lives in the area. She is part of the local entertainment, a masquerade to be held that night. Part of the masquerade is an enactment of the Commedia dell'arte for which two professional dancers are coming down from London to play the parts of Harlequin and Columbine. At dinner the conversation turns to the Soviet state and the tragic loss of the ballerina Kharsanova by the Bolsheviks in the early days of the revolution. After dinner, Anna calls to learn if the dancers have arrived yet, only to learn that they have been injured in a car crash. Prince Sergius Oranoff drove the car, and arrives later. Anna knows Oranoff, and seems quite happy in his presence. Satterthwaite likes him for his knowledge of the arts. In the evening Satterthwaite sees two loves in lane, Molly with John Denham. Anna sees them too, and stays with Satterthwaite for support. Anna dances the role of Columbine while Quin dances as Harlequin. The performance is a success. Satterthwaite recognises by her dancing that Anna is the lost Kharsanova. In the darkness of the garden, she tells Satterthwaite that she gave up dancing because John wanted a wife and she loved John. She says now she will change to being with one who loved her so many years. Anna tells Satterthwaite after her dance, \\"I know, my friend, I know. But there is no third way. Always one looks for one thing--the lover, the perfect, the eternal lover... It is the music of Harlequin one hears. No lover ever satisfies one, for all lovers are mortal. And Harlequin is only a myth, an invisible presence... unless------\\" ... \\"Unless--his name is--Death!\\" Oranoff expects to meet Anna that night. Satterthwaite sees Anna and a figure dressed as Harlequin in the \\"Lover's Lane\\"; the Harlequin is Mr Quin but somehow with a face like Denham had ten years earlier, when he was still adventurous. Anna's maid saw her go by, but saw her walk alone, which greatly confuses Satterthwaite. He is afraid for Anna, so he and Oranoff rush down to the tip where they see Anna's dead body. Quin turns up and Satterthwaite asks why the maid could not see Mr Quin as he could. Quin replies that Satterthwaite can see things other people cannot, and then quietly departs. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement review of 29 May 1930 failed to comment on the merits of the book, confining itself to summarising the relationship between Quin and Satterthwaite and concluding that the latter is helped \\"to solve old mysteries, sometimes to restore happiness to the unfortunate, and sometimes to see, if not avert, impending tragedy\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 29 May 1930 (p. 461) The New York Times Book Review of 4 May 1930 started by saying, \\"To call the tales in this collection detective stories would be misleading. For all of them deal with mystery and some of them with crime, they are, nevertheless, more like fairy tales.\\" The anonymous reviewer described Mr Satterthwaite and Mr Quin and their relationship to the stories and each other, and then concluded, \\"The book offers a rare treat for the discriminating reader.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 4 May 1930 (p. 25) In the Daily Express (25 April 1930), Harold Nicolson said, \\"Mr. Quinn and Mr. Satterthwaite are, to me, new characters, and I should like much more of them. Mrs. Christie always writes intelligently, and I enjoyed these stories as much as any she has written.\\"Daily Express, 25 April 1930 (p. 8) Robert Barnard wrote: \\"An odd collection, with the whimsical-supernatural element strong, though not always unpleasing. There are some notably dreadful stories (Bird with the Broken Wing, Voice in the Dark) but the unusual number of erudite or cultural references bears witness to Christie's own opinion of these stories ‚Äì they were aimed more 'up-market' than usual.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (p. 200). Fontana Books, 1990; References and allusions =References to other works= * The character of Mr Harley Quin is clearly based upon Harlequin from the 16th century Italian Commedia dell'arte. The earlier versions of the character were that of a clown or fool, but in the 18th century the character changed to become a romantic hero. In The Coming of Mr. Quin, Quin tells Satterthwaite \\"I must recommend the Harlequinade to your attention. It is dying out nowadays ‚Äì but it repays attention, I assure you.\\" The Harlequinade was the still-later British stage version, in which Harlequin has magical powers, and brings about changes of scenery by a touch of his slapstick. Christie also refers to the Harlequin character in the Masque from Italy sequence of poems in her 1925 collection The Road of Dreams (reprinted in 1973 in Poems), and in her first- ever published magazine short story The Affair at the Victory Ball (1923) (here, in the Commedia dell'arte version of the characters), published in book form in the US collection The Under Dog and Other Stories (1951) and in the UK in Poirot's Early Cases (1974). The traditional image of Harlequin as portrayed in a Danish production of the Commedia dell'arte. * In The Mysterious Mr Quin, several impressions are given to the reader, through Satterthwaite's almost subconscious thoughts, of the connection between the appearance of Quin and the traditional costume of Harlequin, the latter being a dark mask and clothing composed of multi-coloured diamond-shapes, as featured on the cover of the UK first edition of the book (see image above). In The Coming of Mr Quin, Quin is first described in the following passage: :\\"Framed in the doorway stood a man's figure, tall and slender. To Mr Satterthwaite, watching, he appeared by some curious effect of the stained glass above the door, to be dressed in every colour of the rainbow. Then, as he stepped forward, he showed himself to be a thin dark man dressed in motoring clothes.\\" Later in the same story, the mask effect is described thus: :\\"Mr Quin acknowledged the introductions, and dropped into the chair that Evesham had hospitably pulled forward. As he sat, some effect of the firelight threw a bar of shadow across his face which gave almost the impression of a mask.\\" In The Shadow on the Glass, the literary effect is repeated as follows: :\\"Mr Quin sat down. The red‚Äêshaded lamp threw a broad band of coloured light over the checked pattern of his overcoat, and left his face in shadow almost as though he wore a mask.\\" In The Sign in the Sky, the description is: :\\"[The table] was already occupied by a tall dark man who sat with his face in shadow, and with a play of colour from a stained window turning his sober garb into a kind of riotous motley.\\" The Soul of the Croupier ends with the sentence, \\"Mr Quin smiled, and a stained glass panel behind him invested him for just a moment in a motley garment of coloured light...\\" In The Bird with the Broken Wing, Mabelle Annesley says, :\\"I was out in the woods late this afternoon, and I met a man ‚Äì such a strange sort of man ‚Äì tall and dark, like a lost soul. The sun was setting, and the light of it through the trees made him look like a kind of Harlequin.\\" * In The Shadow on the Glass, Captain Allenson states that Mr and Mrs Scott are \\"doing the turtle dove stunt\\", thereby referring to the bird as a symbol of love. The name of house in the story ‚Äì Greenway's House ‚Äì is possibly derived from the name of Christie's future home, Greenway House, on the banks on the River Dart in Devon. Although Christie did not purchase the house until 1938, she had been aware of its existence since childhood. * The Arlecchino restaurant features in both The Sign in the Sky and The Face of Helen as a place where Quin states he often goes. The word \\"Arlecchino\\" is Italian for \\"Harlequin\\". * In The Face of Helen, Quin states that there are reasons why he is attracted to the opera Pagliacci. This opera (whose name translates in Italian as \\"Clowns\\") depicts a group of performers of the Commedia dell'arte in which Harlequin is one of the chief characters. The opera is also referenced in Swan Song, the final story in the 1934 collection The Listerdale Mystery. * In The Bird with the Broken Wing, one of the songs that Mabelle Annesley plays and sings is The Swan by Edvard Grieg (En Svane from Op. 25 [No. 2] Six poems by Henrik Ibsen). * In Harlequin's Lane, the lyrics of the \\"old Irish ballad\\" that Molly Stanwell sings are in fact from Christie's own poem Dark Sheila, first printed in the Poetry Today issue for May/June 1919 and later reprinted in her collections The Road of Dreams (1925) and Poems (1973). * In Harlequin's Lane, Satterthwaith says to Quin, \\"Bring me the two most beautiful things in the city, said God. You know how it goes, eh?\\" He refers to the Happy Prince of Oscar Wilde in which God gives this order to an angel. =References to actual history, geography and current science= In The Dead Harlequin, the character of Aspasia Glen is an early attempt by Christie to portray the acclaimed American monologist Ruth Draper (1884‚Äì1956). She re-used and enlarged upon the idea in her 1933 novel Lord Edgware Dies with the character of Carlotta Adams.Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography. (p. 437). Collins, 1977; . The story The Man from the Sea was written in Puerto de la Cruz in the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The Villa La Paz still exists, and is one of the heritage-listed buildings in the town. Unluckily, the \\"cypresses walk\\" has been detached from the garden by a new road, but there are still commanding and impressive views of the ocean and the cliff. =References in other works= Christie re-uses the plot device of the train smoke from The Sign in the Sky as an alibi in Taken at the Flood (1948). Adaptations The Coming of Mr Quin, the first short story in the Anthology, would be adapted into film as The Passing of Mr. Quinn in 1928, directed by Julius Hagen and Leslie S. Hiscott and adapted by Hiscott. The cast included: * Stewart Rome ... Dr Alec Portal * Trilby Clark ... Mrs Eleanor Appleby * Ursula Jeans ... Vera, the Maid * Clifford Heatherley ... Professor Appleby * Mary Brough ... Cook * Vivian Baron ... Derek Cappel * Kate Gurney ... Landlady The film, in turn, was \\"novelized\\" as The Passing of Mr. Quinn by G. Roy McRae (London Book Company, 1929). The (unpublished) play Someone at the Window (1934) was adapted by Christie from the short story The Dead Harlequin. A series of abridged readings of three of the stories (\\"The Coming of Mr Quin\\", \\"The Soul of the Croupier\\", \\"At the 'Bells and Motley'\\") were broadcast 15‚Äì17 September 2009 on BBC Radio 4 as part of the Afternoon Readings program and performed by Martin Jarvis. A second series of abridged readings (\\"The World's End\\", \\"The Face of Helen\\", \\"The Sign in the Sky\\") was broadcast 15‚Äì17 September 2010 on BBC Radio 4 and again performed by Martin Jarvis. A third set (\\"The Dead Harlequin\\", \\"The Man from the Sea\\", \\"Harlequin's Lane\\") was broadcast 6‚Äì8 September 2011 on BBC Radio 4 and again performed by Martin Jarvis. The readings have since been rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra. Other appearances of Harley Quin or Mr Satterthwaite In Agatha Christie's Autobiography, she claims that Quin and Satterthwaite became two of her favourite characters. The latter appeared in the 1935 novel, Three Act Tragedy, and very briefly in the short story Dead Man's Mirror, a 1937 collection of four short stories. Outside of this collection, Quin appeared in two further short stories: The Harlequin Tea Set and The Love Detectives, which were both included in the 1992 UK collection Problem at Pollensa Bay. In the US, the former story appeared as the title story in the 1997 collection The Harlequin Tea Set and the latter in the earlier 1950 collection Three Blind Mice and Other Stories. The Love Detectives, The Harlequin Tea Set, Three Act Tragedy (a Poirot story in which Satterthwaite makes an appearance) and Dead Man's Mirror were included in the collection The Complete Quin and Satterthwaite: Love Detectives (UK, HarperCollins; ).

ISIS Audio Books released an unabridged recording in 1993 read by Geoffrey Matthews (). =First publication of stories= The first UK magazine publication of all the stories has not been fully documented. A partial listing is as follows: * The Coming of Mr Quin: First published as The Passing of Mr Quin in issue 229 of the Grand Magazine in March 1924. * The Shadow on the Glass: First published in issue 236 of the Grand Magazine in October 1924. * The Sign in the Sky: First published under the slightly different title of A Sign in the Sky in issue 245 of the Grand Magazine in July 1925. * At the Bells and Motley: First published as A Man of Magic in issue 249 of the Grand Magazine in November 1925. * The Soul of the Croupier: First published in issue 237 of The Story-Teller magazine in January 1927. * The World's End: First published under the slightly abbreviated title of World's End in issue 238 of The Story-Teller Magazine in February 1927 * The Voice in the Dark: First published in issue 239 of The Story-Teller magazine in March 1927. * The Face of Helen: First published in issue 240 of The Story-Teller magazine in April 1927. * Harlequin's Lane: First published in issue 241 of The Story-Teller magazine in May 1927. * The Dead Harlequin: First published in issue 289 of the Grand Magazine in March 1929. * The Man From the Sea: First published in volume 1, number 6 of Britannia and Eve magazine in October 1929. The story was illustrated by Steven Spurrier. The five stories in The Story-teller magazine above were part of a six-story sequence titled The Magic of Mr Quin. The sixth story in the sequence (and the first to be published) was At the Crossroads in issue 236 in December 1926. The story was published in the US in Flynn's Weekly in October 1926 (Volume XIX, Number 3). Retitled The Love Detectives, the story appeared in book form in the US in 1950 in Three Blind Mice and Other Stories and in the UK in Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories in 1991. No UK magazine printing The Bird with the Broken Wing has yet been traced. A partial listing of the first US magazine publications is as follows: * The Coming of Mr Quin: March 1925 (Volume LXXXIV, Number 2) issue of Munsey's Magazine magazine under the title Mr Quinn Passes By; the story was not illustrated. * At the Bells and Motley: 17 July 1926 (Volume XVI, Number 6) issue of Flynn's Weekly with an uncredited illustration. * The Soul of the Croupier: 13 November 1926 (Volume XIX, Number 5) issue of Flynn's Weekly with an uncredited illustration. * The World's End: 20 November 1926 (Volume XIX, Number 6) issue of Flynn's Weekly with an uncredited illustration. * The Voice in the Dark: 4 December 1926 (Volume XX, Number 1) issue of Flynn's Weekly with an uncredited illustration. * The Face of Helen: 6 August 1927 issue of Detective Story Magazine. * Harlequin's Lane: 27 August 1927 (Volume XXVI, Number 4) issue of Flynn‚Äôs Weekly. * The Dead Harlequin: 22 June 1929 (Volume 42, Number 3) issue of Detective Fiction Weekly with an uncredited illustration. =Book dedication= Christie's dedication in the book reads: \\"To Harlequin the invisible\\". This dedication is unusual for two reasons; first, few of her short story collections carried a dedication and, second, it is the only time that Christie dedicated a book to one of her fictional creations. =Dustjacket blurb= The blurb of the first edition (which is carried on both the back of the dustjacket and opposite the title page) reads: > Mr Satterthwaite is a dried-up elderly little man who has never known > romance or adventure himself. He is a looker-on at life. But he feels an > increasing desire to play a part in the drama of other people ‚Äì especially > is he drawn to mysteries of unsolved crime. And here he has a helper ‚Äì the > mysterious Mr Quin ‚Äì the man who appears from nowhere ‚Äì who 'comes and goes' > like the invisible Harlequin of old. Who is Mr Quin? No one knows, but he is > one who 'speaks for the dead who cannot speak for themselves', and he is > also a friend to lovers. Prompted by his mystic influence, Mr Satterthwaite > plays a real part in life at last, and unravels mysteries that seem > incapable of solution. In Mr Quin, Agatha Christie has created a character > as fascinating as Hercule Poirot himself.

It was long and stretched from Baltimore, Maryland (some old maps indicate New York City was the actual eastern terminus), to California. Much of the route follows the old National Road and the Santa Fe Trail. National Old Trails Road Association The National Old Trails Road Association was formed in Kansas City in April 1912 to promote improvement of a transcontinental trail from Baltimore to Los Angeles, with branches to New York City and San Francisco. The name of the road signified that it followed several of the Nation's historic trails, including the National Road and the Santa Fe Trail (much of the road, from Colorado east, became U.S. 40 in 1926). Former Jackson County, Missouri Judge J. M. Lowe served as the Association‚Äôs president from its inception until his death in 1926. Judge Lowe had been a tireless proponent for good roads‚Äîdespite the fact that, as he once told the Senate Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, \\"I do not even own an automobile, and would not know what the dickens to do with it if I had one.\\" Under Judge Lowe, the association had become well respected among the groups aligned in the Good Roads Movement that had agitated since the 1890s for government involvement in improvement of the Nation's roads. =Harry S. Truman as president of the Association= In 1926, future President Harry S. Truman was named president of the National Old Trails Road Association. As the new president of the association, Truman periodically drove the National Old Trails Road from coast to coast and met with members of the association in each State to discuss improvement of their segments. He enjoyed the travels, but he missed his wife Bess and their young daughter Margaret, as reflected in the many letters he wrote to his wife while on the road. At one point, he told Bess, \\"This is almost like campaigning for President, except that the people are making promises to me instead of the other way around.\\" Truman's name would remain on the letterhead of the National Old Trails Road Association well into the late 1940s, listed as \\"president\\". =Madonna of the Trail monuments= One of Truman's accomplishments as president of the National Old Trails Road Association was his work with the Daughters of the American Revolution to place Madonna of the Trail statues in the 12 states along the National Old Trails Road. Conceived by Mrs. John Trigg Moss of the DAR, the statues are dedicated to the pioneer mothers of covered-wagon days. Each statue is 18 feet high, consisting of a 10-foot-high pioneer mother mounted on a base. The DAR describes the statue: \\"The \`Madonna of the Trail' is a pioneer clad in homespun, clasping her babe to her breast, with her young son clinging to her skirts. The face of the mother, strong in character, beauty and gentleness, is the face of a mother who realizes her responsibilities and trusts in God.\\" National Old Trails Road development in the western United States Although the western half of the road was signed by the Automobile Club of Southern California in mid-1914, according to their in-house magazine Touring Topics, the routing remained under much discussion until 1917. In particular, the western alignment was debated, with an early proposed routing going through Phoenix, Arizona, and San Diego, California, up to San Francisco, California. Eventually, however, the alignment below was agreed upon, which followed earlier Indian trails, preexisting railroad tracks and, in some cases, new construction. Throughout its life, the road was upgraded and realigned in order to improve the route. But, by 1926, significant portions in the west remained difficult to drive on, and much remained unpaved. Only were paved in 1927. Most of the road that traversed the California desert was widened and paved (or \\"oiled\\") by the late '20s, reportedly by a process pioneered by a local road superintendent, and some of this blacktop still can be found to this day. In 1926, the section west of Las Vegas, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, was certified as U.S. Highway 66, (now better known as U.S. Route 66) by the AASHTO, as was a section in the St. Louis, Missouri area (Manchester Road). After U.S. Route 66 was decommissioned, in eastern California portions of the road were renamed with the old name, and signed accordingly. Most of the modern-day \\"National Trails Highway\\" follows latter-day U.S. Route 66, however, and not any of the alignments that actually were part of the original road (the main exception being the section of road between Barstow and Victorville, which follows the almost exact routing of the 1925 realignment of the road). The last alignment of National Old Trails Road in California (and the first alignment of U.S. Route 66) followed a distinct course from the modern-day route between Daggett and Essex, California, and now survives only as a series of now-disconnected jeep trails and abandoned tracks in various stages of decay. The modern-day Route 66 in California is a result of a series of realignments that were undertaken in the early 1930s.

Research Alec Broers began his research career in the Engineering Department of the University of Cambridge in 1961 working with Professor Oatley, and later with Dr William C Nixon, on the in situ study of surfaces undergoing ion etching in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The microscope he used had originally been built by Oatley and had then been modified Garry Stewart who had also added an ion source that focussed ions onto the sample surface. Garry Stewart, who was another of Professor Oatley's students, then moved to the Cambridge Instrument Company where he oversaw the design and building of the world's first commercial SEM, the Stereoscan. During his PhD Alec rebuilt the SEM fitting a magnetic final lens in place of the original electrostatic lens thereby improving the microscope's resolution to about 10 nm, and after examining ion etched surfaces, used the microscope's electron beam for the first time to write patterns, subsequently using ion etching to transfer these patterns into gold, tungsten and silicon structures as small as 40 nm. These were the first man-made nanostructures in materials suitable for microelectronic circuits opening up the possibility for the extreme miniaturization of electronic circuits that was to occur in the decades to come. After graduating from Cambridge, Lord Broers spent nearly 20 years in research and development with IBM in the United States. He worked for sixteen years at the Thomas J Watson Research Centre in New York, then for 3 years at the East Fishkill Development Laboratory, and finally at Corporate Headquarters. His first assignment at the T J Watson Research laboratory was to find a long life electron emitter to replace the tungsten wire filaments used in electron microscopes at the time. IBM had built the first billion bit computer store using an electron beam to write on photographic film and the relatively short lifetime of the tungsten filament sources was not acceptable. To solve this problem he developed the first practical electron guns that used LaB6 emitters. These emitters not only solved the lifetime problem, but also provided higher electron brightness than tungsten filaments, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s he built two new SEMs for examining surfaces that took advantage of this and produced higher resolution than previous SEMs (3 nm in the secondary electron surface mode) and then a short focal length instrument with 0.5 nm beam size. He used the second SEM to examine thin samples in the transmission mode and to examine solid samples using the high energy electron scattered from the surface of the sample, the electrons that had been called 'low-loss electrons by Oliver C Wells who had proposed their use in the SEM. Initially this high resolution low-loss mode was used to examine bacteriophage and blood cells in collaboration with researchers at NYU, and at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Jersey however, the bulk of his work was devoted to using the microscopes as tools to scribe things using the lithography techniques that were becoming familiar for making silicon chips. He and his colleague Michael Hatzakis used these new electron beam lithography to make the first silicon transistors with micron dimensions.\\"High Resolution Electron Beam Fabrication\\", A. N. Broers & M. Hatzakis, Proc. National Electronics Conference, National Electronics Conference, Inc., p. 826‚Äì829, 1969 judged best Conference Paper and sub-micron dimensions showing that it would be possible to scale down the dimensions of electron devices well below the dimensions that were being used at the time. \\"I had a marvellous time doing research in the IBM research laboratory\\" he recalls \\"I had essentially turned my hobby into my career.\\" He remembers having a roomful of electronics and was overjoyed to spend his time building new things and testing them. There he spent around 16 years in research in one of the best 'playhouses for electronics' in the world, building microscopes and equipment for the fabrication of miniature components. In 1977 he was given the enviable position of being an IBM fellow, an honour accorded to, at that time, only around 40 out of IBM's 40,000 engineers and scientists. This gave him the freedom to follow whatever road of enquiry he wished and he continued his work pushing the limits of what was called at the time microfabrication. Over the next ten years he conducted a series of careful experiments measuring the ultimate resolution of electron beam lithography\\"Resolution Limits of PMMA Resist for Electron Beam Exposure\\", 9th Int. Conf. on Electron & Ion Beam Sci. & Technol., Ed. R. Bakish, Electrochemical Soc., Princeton, N.J., p. 396‚Äì406, 1980, & J. Electrochem. Soc., 128, p. 166‚Äì170, 1980 and then used the highest resolution methods to fabricate electronic devices. One of the deleterious effects that limited resolution was the fogging effect of the electrons backscattered from the bulk of the sample. To avoid this Broers and Sedgwick invented a thin membrane substrate using technologies used to make inkjet printer heads. The membrane was thin enough effectively to eliminate the backscattered electrons. These membrane substrates allowed the first metal structures with dimensions below 10 nm to be fabricated and tested. Because these dimensions were now measured in single nanometers he and his coworkers decided to call these nanostructures and the techniques used to make them nanofabrication\\"Josephson Effect in Nb Nanostructures\\", R. B. Laibowitz, A. N. Broers, J. T. Yeh, J. M. Viggiano, W. Molzen, Applied Physics Letters, 35, p. 891‚Äì893, 1979 rather than use the prefix micro that had been common parlance until then. These membrane samples also found application many years later in MEMs (Micro-Electro-Mechanical) devices, and also as 'cantilevers' in biomedical applications. Early experiments with X-ray lithography also used similar membranes. When he arrived back in Cambridge, Lord Broers set up a nanofabrication laboratory to extend the technology of miniaturisation to the atomic scale by developing some of the novel fabrication methods\\"Electron Beam Lithography‚ÄîResolution Limits\\", Broers, A. N.; Hoole A. C. N. and Ryan J. M.; Microelectronic Engineering 32, pp. 131‚Äì142, 1996 that he had discovered at IBM. He modified a 400 kV transmission electron microscope (JEOL 4000EX) so that it operated in a scanning mode and produced a minimum beam size of about 0.3 nm. He used this system working in collaboration with researchers at the IMEC microelectronics research laboratory in Leuven, Belgium, to build some of the smallest and fastest field effect transistors that had ever been built.

The Khas people speak the Khas language.or Gorkhali, They are also known as Parbatiyas, Parbates and Paharis/Pahades or Gorkhali. The term Khas has now become obsolete, as the Khas people have adopted communal identities such as Thakuri and Chhetri because of the negative stereotypes associated with the term Khas. Although the term Khas has gained popularity in Nepali identity politics since the 1990s, many castes currently categorized as Khas and arya. may not identify themselves as Khas. According to the Constitution of Nepal, Chhetris, Thakuris, and Sanyasis who are citizens of Nepal should be considered as Khas Arya for electoral puposes. Origin They have been connected to the Khasas mentioned in the ancient Hindu literature. Historian Bal Krishna Sharma and Nepalese anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista speculates that the Khas or kus people were of Yuezhi origin. Historian Baburam Acharya speculates that Khas are a sub-clan of Ai·∏ça, a clan that originated at Idavritt (modern day Kashmir). Khas were living in the Idavaritt in the 3rd millennium BCE. and the original meaning of the term Khas was Raja or Kshatriya (Yoddha). He further speculates that Kashmir has been named from its local residents Khas as Khasmir. In the 2nd millennium B.C.E., one group of Khas migrated towards Kazakhstan while the other group migrated east of Sutlej river settling only in the hill regions up to Bheri River. Historian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that Khas were not the Vedic Aryans but Aryans of latter period like the Gurjara, Darada, Shaka, and Pallava. He further asserts that post-Vedic Aryans were akin to Vedic Aryans in terms of Indo-Aryan languages and Indian culture.  History  Khas are believed to have arrived in the western reaches of Nepal at the beginning of first-millennium B.C. or middle of first-millennium A.D. from the north-west. It is likely that they absorbed people from different ethnic groups during this immigration. They have been connected to the medieval Khasa Malla kingdom. In the initial phase, majority of Khas people became Brahmins and others became Kshatriyas. and Dalit of nepal hill. Traditionally, the Khas were divided into \\"Khas Brahmins\\" (also called Bahuns) and \\"Khas Rajputs\\" (also called Chhetris). In the Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand in India, the Khas Brahmins and Khas Rajputs had a lower social status than the other Brahmins and Rajputs. However, in present-day western Nepal, they had the same status as the other Brahmins and Rajputs, possibly as a result of their political power in the Khasa Malla kingdom. Copper Inscription by King of Doti, Raika Mandhata Shahi at Saka Era 1612 (‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•á ‡•ß‡•¨‡•ß‡•®) (or 1747 Bikram Samvat) in old Khas language using Devanagari script Until the 19th century, the Gorkhali referred to their country as Khas Desh (Khas country). As they annexed the various neighbouring countries (such as Newar of the Newar people) to the Gorkha kingdom, the terms such as Khas and Newar ceased to be used as the names of countries. The 1854 legal code (Muluki Ain), promulgated by the Nepali Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana, himself a Khas, no longer referred to Khas as a country, rather as a jƒÅt (species or community) within the Gorkha kingdom. The Shah dynasty of the Gorkha Kingdom, as well as the succeeding Rana dynasty, spoke the Khas language (now called the Nepali language). However, they claimed to be Rajputs of western Indian origin, rather than the native Khas Kshatriyas. Since outside Nepal, the Khas social status was seen as inferior to that of the Rajputs, the rulers started describing themselves as natives of the Hill country, rather than that of the Khas country. Most people, however, considered the terms Khas and Parbatiya (Pahari/Pahadi or Hill people) as synonymous. Jung Bahadur also re-labeled the Khas jƒÅt as Chhetri in present-day Nepal. Originally, the Brahmin immigrants from the plains considered the Khas as low-caste because of the latter's neglect of high-caste taboos (such as alcohol abstinence). The upper-class Khas people commissioned the Bahun (Brahmin) priests to initiate them into the high-caste Chhetri order and adopted high-caste manners. Other Khas families who could not afford to (or did not care to) pay the Bahun priests also attempted to assume the Chhetri status but were not recognized as such by others. They are now called Matwali (alcohol-drinker khas) Chhetris. Because of the adoption of the Chhetri identity, the term Khas is rapidly becoming obsolete. According to Dor Bahadur Bista (1991), \\"the Khas have vanished from the ethnographic map of Nepal\\".

Khas people are addressed with the term Khayan or Parbatiya or PartyƒÅ, Parbat√© meaning hill-dweller by Newars. The hill Khas tribe are in large part associated with the Gorkhali warriors. Language =History= The Khas people originally referred to their language as Khas kurƒÅ (Khas speech), which was also known as Parbatiya (the language of the hill country). The Newar people used the term Khayan Bhaya, Parbatiya and Gorkhali as a name for this language, as they identified it with the Gorkhali conquerors. The Gorkhalis themselves started using this term to refer to their language at a later stage. In an attempt to disassociate himself with his Khas past, the Rana monarch Jung Bahadur decreed that the term Gorkhali be used instead of Khas kurƒÅ to describe the language. Meanwhile, the British Indian administrators had started using the term Nepal (after Newar) to refer to the Gorkha kingdom. In the 1930s, the Gorkha government also adopted this term to describe their country. Subsequently, the Khas language also came to be known as Nepali language. It has become a national language of Nepal and lingua franca among the majority of population of North Bengal, Sikkim and Bhutan. =Classification= Historian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that the Khas language belonged to neither the Iranian language family, nor the Indian languages, but to the mid Indo-Iranian languages. Modern =Nepal= Modern-day Khas people are referred to as Khas Brahmin (commonly called as Khas Bahun), Khas Rajput (commonly called as Khas Chhetri) and Khas Dalit. Khas people are popularly referred in modern times as Khas and Arya. =India= In Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand in India, too, the term Khas has become obsolete. The Khas (or Khasia) people of Kumaon adopted the self-designation Kumaoni Jiagahari Rajput, after being elevated to the Rajput status by the Chand kings.

The name means Good Garden of Minas (Gerais). It is situated in the southern part of Minas Gerais and in the middle of the Mantiqueira Mountains, at 1,200 meters high, which gives the city a mild climate. The only paved road that reaches Bom Jardim de Minas is the BR-267, which connects the city to the southern part of the State of Minas Gerais and the region of Juiz de Fora. Population: 6,500 inhabitants. It was founded in 1770 with the formation of a farm land in current city. When it came near the farm houses, became a parish and then the district with the installation of the chapel on May 2, 1856. And finally, in 1938, the district was upgrade to city, with two districts, headquarters and Tabo√£o. Currently, the city has been increasing in the festivities such as Carnival. An agricultural exhibition in May, and a feast in honour of Jesus Christ in August. Along with the natural attractions of waterfalls and mountain scenery these contribute to the tourism industry of the city.  History  In 1770 Arriaga Manoel de Oliveira, accompanied by his wife and six children, founded the Colony of Campo Vermelho near the current city. They were attacked by a tribe of Indians who inhabited the region and during the attack one of his sons was killed. Manoel Arriaga, very saddened by the fact, turned away from the colony and settled on the banks of the Milho Branco stream where he set up a farm which in time became the city.Driven by: FERREIRA, Jurandir Pires. Text by: PEREIRA, Maria Auxiliadora Peres; & DIAS, Miguel. Enciclop√©dia dos Munic√≠pios Brasileiros. Rio de Janeiro: IBGE, 1957. Years later, Manoel Arriaga was visited by the illustrious Captain Antonio Correia de Lacerda and his family. He joined with Manoel Arriaga in expanding the farm and beginning the cultivation of land on a large scale. At the request of Captain Lacerda the chapel of Bom Jardim, today the old parish church, was erected in the village centre. Some years later, with the union of families Arriaga and Lacerda, the farm received the name \\"Fazenda do Bom Jardim\\". The origin of the name was due to a well maintained garden near the farmhouse. In 1856 the village of Senhor Bom Jesus do Bom Jardim was instituted by provincial Law No. 761 of May 2 as belonging to the municipality of Turvo. The effect of State Law No. 843 of 7 September 1923 was to rename the District to \\"Bom Jardim\\" but continuing to belong to the municipality of Turvo. Soon after, under State Law No. 1160, the City of Turvo had its name changed to Andrel√¢ndia. The Municipality with the name of Bom Jardim, was created by Decree-State Law No. 148 of December 17, 1938. It consisted of two districts: the headquarters, originally part of the Municipality of Andrel√¢ndia, and Tabo√£o from the city of Rio Preto. By Decree-State Law No. 1058 of 31 December 1943 the City of Bom Jardim changed its name to Bom Jardim de Minas and included the new district of Arantina, split off from the District Headquarters. In 1962 Arantina was emancipated and Bom Jardim de Minas reverted to having the two districts of Headquarters and Tabo√£o.  Geography  The area of the municipality is , representing 0.07% of the state, the region 0.045% and 0.005% of the entire Brazilian territory. Located on the banks of the Rio Grande in the southern region of the state of Minas Gerais, and the Serra da Mantiqueira. It is located from Belo Horizonte, the state capital. The relief of the municipality consists of plateaus, with an average altitude of 1,100 meters, however, this average decreases toward the Rio Grande, to form the lowland rain that is circumvented by the \\"sea of hills and mountains,\\" with higher topographic level. The culmination is the altitude of 1733 meters, the Serra da Bandeira, in Tabo√£o. The region consists of many Tabo√£o high altitude mountains with many water springs, which means that there are several waterfalls in the region. The headwaters of the Rio do Peixe, one of the largest rivers in the region, located in the hills district Tabo√£o.  Climate  The city has mesothermal highland tropical climate, with cold and dry winter rains and higher, taking into account the situation of latitude and altitude ranging from 990m to 1733m. According to regional averages, the winter is hardly unpleasant unless one or the other day, the coldest month, July, has averaged approximately 55 ¬∞F and 61 ¬∞F, daily maximum of 71 ¬∞F and 73 ¬∞F and minimum of 41 ¬∞F to 50 ¬∞F and may reach even with minimum absolute in Celsius Scale up to 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞C), and may even gear.

He was an Olympic gold medalist, a world champion, and a two-time national champion in Olympic weightlifting. Anderson contributed significantly to the development of competitive powerlifting. Early life Anderson was born in Toccoa, Georgia, the only son of Ethel Bennett and Robert Anderson. As a teenager, he began his early weight training and gaming on his own in his family's backyard to increase his size and strength so that he would be able to play on the Toccoa High School football team, where he earned a position as first-team blocking back. He used special homemade weights that his father created out of concrete poured into a wooden form. Anderson later attended Furman University for one year on a football scholarship before moving to Elizabethton, Tennessee with his parents. There he met weightlifter Bob Peoples, who would greatly influence him in squat training and introduce him into weightlifting circles. Career In 1955, at the height of the Cold War, Anderson, as winner of the USA National Amateur Athletic Union Weightlifting Championship, traveled to the Soviet Union, where weightlifting was a popular sport, for an international weightlifting competition. In a newsreel of the event shown in the United States the narrator, Bud Palmer, commented as follows: \\"Then, up to the bar stepped a great ball of a man, Paul Anderson.\\" Palmer said, \\"The Russians snickered as Anderson gripped the bar which was set at 402.5 pounds, an unheard-of lift. But their snickers quickly changed to awe and all-out cheers as up went the bar and Anderson lifted the heaviest weight overhead of any human in history.\\" \\"We rarely have such weights lifted,\\" said the solemn Russian announcer as Anderson hoisted in the two-hand press. Prior to Anderson's lift, the Soviet champion, Alexey Medvedev, had matched the Olympic record of the time with a press. Anderson then did a press. At a time when Americans were engaged in a symbolic Cold War battle with the Soviet Union, Anderson's strength ‚Äî and his singular, tank-like appearance ‚Äî became a rallying cry to all. During the 1955 World Championships in Munich, Germany that October, of the 27th, Anderson went on to establish two other world records (for the press [] and total weight cleared []) as he easily won the competition in his weight class to become world champion. Upon his return to the United States, Anderson was received by then Vice-President Richard Nixon, who thanked him for being such a wonderful goodwill ambassador. In 1956, Anderson won a gold medal in a long, tough duel in the Melbourne, Australia Olympic Games as a weightlifter in the super-heavyweight class (while suffering from a fever) with Argentine Humberto Selvetti. The two competitors were tied in the amount of weight lifted, but because Anderson, who weighed in at , was lighter than Selvetti, who weighed , Anderson was awarded the gold medal. Anderson could not compete in the year 1960 Olympics because he had been ruled a professional for accepting money for some of his weightlifting and strength exhibitions. Thus at the 1960 Olympics the Soviet heavyweight Yury Vlasov bested records set at the 1956 Olympics, with Anderson not competing in the contest. A short time later however, not to be outdone by the Russian and to verify his position as the World's Strongest Man, Anderson lifted the same weight as the Russian three times in quick succession demonstrating unbelievable strength. This feat solidified his position as the most dominant lifter in the world and cemented his legacy as the strongest of the strong. Paul Anderson, 1957 In 1961, Anderson and his wife Glenda founded the Paul Anderson Youth Home, a home for troubled youth in Vidalia, Georgia. They both helped to build and support the Home with an average of 500 speaking engagements and strength exhibitions per year‚Äînotwithstanding the chronic congenital kidney disease that eventually killed him at age 61. He would perform stunts such as hammering a nail with his bare fist and raising a table loaded with eight men onto his back. The Guinness Book of World Records (1985 edition) lists his feat of lifting in a back lift as \\"the greatest weight ever raised by a human being\\". Anderson turned professional after the 1956 Summer Olympics, and so many of his feats of strength, while generally credible, were not done under rigorous enough conditions to be official. In fact, there is controversy surrounding the 1985 edition Guinness Book of World Records that cited him for a back lift of 6270 pounds. The current Guinness record is , set by Gregg Ernst in 1993. Personal life In 1960, Anderson married Glenda Garland. The couple were devout Christians. They had a daughter named Paula (born 1966). While competing, Anderson weighed between and was tall. Death As a child, Anderson suffered from Bright's disease (now known as chronic nephritis), a kidney disorder, and he eventually died from kidney disease. Legacy Anderson's true life testimony can be heard as a dramatization through the Unshackled! radio ministries on program number 2521. Unshackled! has also produced a comic booklet telling the story of Anderson. Paul Anderson Memorial Park, which features a large statue of him performing an overhead barbell lift, located at the corner of Tugalo Street and Big A Road in Toccoa, is named for him. In July 2019, an episode of the History Channel show ‚ÄúThe Strongest Man in History‚Äù featured Paul Anderson and several of his historic feats of strength.

Here, as they got pissed [drunk], their stories became more and more fantastic. One heard of deltoids like watermelons and squats of a thousand pounds. This last turned out to be a solid fact for the incredible Paul Anderson. He was squatting with almost twice as much as anyone else's maximum.\\" * Bruce Wilhelm (2-time World's Strongest Man) : \\"Absolutely no question, Paul was the strongest of the strong. His physical deterioration and prolonged illness for the last 16 years of his life was a fate unbefitting such a great strongman and humanitarian. Paul was really a powerlifter and did the overhead lifts only because powerlifting as a sport did not exist 40 years ago. He excelled and was world and Olympic champ because he was far stronger than anyone else. When I hear people talk that a powerlifter will never win an Olympic gold medal, I tell them that Paul Anderson already did it, almost forty years ago.\\"  References   Further reading  * Anderson, Paul (with Jerry B.

After the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty brought in a fully funded tuition fee freeze at public colleges and universities in April 2004, it announced a sweeping review of public post-secondary education was to take place.  Review process  In the summer of 2004, the government announced that Rae was to head the review. As a backup to the former premier, a seven member advisory panel was announced: Leslie Church, Ian Davidson, Bill Davis, Don Drummond (economist), Inez Elliston, Richard Johnston and Huguette LaBelle. Bill Davis was a Progressive Conservative and former Education Minister and Premier of Ontario. Don Drummond is currently a Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Richard Johnston was formerly a leadership rival to Rae at the 1982 Ontario NDP convention. The panel also included a young Liberal and a former adviser to the federal government. Rae toured the province in fall of 2004, hosting many town-halls and roundtables.  Conclusions  The final report called for deregulation of tuition fees and the introduction of a scheme to finance university and college education - income-contingent loan repayments. The report also called for an increase in public funding of colleges and universities - about half of what had been cut in the past decade, as well as upfront grants for students who come from households with an income of less than $22,000 per annum.  Criticism  Rae's appointment was opposed by many students, who had seen his government permit a 57% increase in tuition fees and the elimination of need-based grants. (The Rae administration cut back on social services as a whole in the early nineties to reduce the deficit caused by the recession.) The composition of the advisory panel also came under fire as none of its members had a record of support for reduced or frozen tuition fees. Rae was also criticized for having drawn conclusions prior to the consultation phase of the review. In May 2004, Rae speculated about the possibility of an outright deregulation of tuition fees - to the outrage of student advocacy groups. Upon its release the report was criticized by Howard Hampton, Rae's former cabinet minister and successor as Ontario NDP leader. This is not surprising, as both had a tenuous relationship during the 1990-95 NDP government; the left-wing Hampton had disapproved of many of Rae's centrist policies. The report was also criticized by the Canadian Federation of Students who had always lobbied for a tuition freeze/lowering. Rae defended his report, arguing that low income non- university individuals would not benefit from a tuition freeze/lowering. He stated that a reduced tuition would make little impact on a student's decision between university and entering the workforce. Rae also said that non- university individuals would be forced to bear the tax burden needed to sustain a freeze/lowering. Supporters also asserted that a university education would primarily benefit the individual rather than being a public good.

Like many genres of contemporary art, sound art may be interdisciplinary in nature, or be used in hybrid forms. In Western art, early examples include Luigi Russolo's Intonarumori or noise intoners (1913), and subsequent experiments by Dadaists, Surrealists, the Situationist International, and in Fluxus happenings. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of visual art or experimental music, or both.Kenneth Goldsmith, Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, Columbia University Press, New York, p. 125 Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are conceptual art, minimalism, site-specific art, sound poetry, electro- acoustic music, spoken word, avant-garde poetry, sound scenography, and experimental theatre.Kenneth Goldsmith, Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, Columbia University Press, New York, p. 136 Origin of the term in the United States According to Dunaway's paper on the history of Sound Art, the term \\"began to be used loosely in the avant- garde scene in the 1970s.\\" It \\"was used interchangeably with other terms such as sonic art, audio art, sound poetry, sound sculpture, and experimental music (to name a few).\\" One of the first published uses of the term was in Something Else Press in their 1974 Yearbook. The first use \\"as the title of an exhibition at a major museum was 1979‚Äôs Sound Art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA),\\" featuring Maggie Payne, Connie Beckley, and Julia Heyward. The curator, Barbara London defined the term thusly, \\"'Sound art' pieces are more closely allied to art than to music, and are usually presented in the museum, gallery, or alternative space.\\" Later, in 1983, the art historian Don Goddard would expand on this, writing about an exhibition called \\"Sound/Art\\" at The Sculpture Center in New York City in 1983 \\"It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that 'hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought.\\"Hellerman and Goddard 1983, . Sound art in Europe =Germany= Originally from Amsterdam, but moved to Berlin is Staalplaat, a record label focused on sound art and experimental music. Transmediale is a yearly festival focused on media art, covering many sound art performances and installations. Global sound art Since the early 1950s Japanese artists involved in the Fluxus and Gutai movement have played a role in the development of Sound Art, including the 1955 work 'Work Bell' by Atsuko Tanaka, which at the time was described as 'living sound' and 'painting with sound'. Tanaka's most famous work 'Electric Dress', consisting of around 200 painted incandescent lights worn as a dress emitted a sonic element, namely the buzzing of the bulbs and the sound of the bulbs connecting with each other each time a small electric shock was felt by the wearer.

Some specific store locations of the chain were sold by Salkin & Linoff in the mid/late 1980s to H. C. Prange Co. of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Salkin & Linoff closed their last five stores in January 1991, and the assets were sold at a bankruptcy sale.

Although his simple, brightly coloured images of Australian landmarks have adorned a very popular range of clothing and homewares sold under the \\"Done Design\\" brand, Done's primary interest is in being a painter. Art critic John McDonald said: \\"Anybody who has anything to do with him realises he is a very serious artist.\\" Early life Ken Done, an only child, grew up in the northern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, and left high school at age 14 to study at the National Art School in East Sydney between 1954 and 1959.Ken done A.M. F.D.I.A (Hon) Hon B.des Ken Done, The Art of Design At the end of this decade he travelled abroad and began working with the New York and London based advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. He returned to Sydney in 1969 to follow his artistic desires. He became a full- time painter in 1975.The Art of Ken Done Janet McKenzie Exhibitions and works Done's first solo exhibition was in Sydney in 1980. To date he has staged over 50 exhibitions dedicated solely to his work. Done's work has been exhibited in Australia, Japan, and France, amongst others. His first European exhibition was held in Paris in 1996. In the year 2000 his works were exhibited in Los Angeles and in London. His work for the 1988 World Exposition held in Brisbane Australia, the colourful Children of the World facade for the United Nations Pavilion, and the several 6 m high alphabet letter blocks that adorned the Entrance and Exit of the Australia Pavilion are largely regarded as playing a central role in the celebration and popular culture of Bicentennial Australia and were one of the most photographed works of art at the Expo. They have as part of the 30th Anniversary celebration of Expo 88 in 2018, been fully restored, including an interview with Ken Done. In 1994 the Powerhouse Museum staged a major retrospective of Done's work. In 2015 from Dec 11 to Dec 20, 2015, Ken done exhibited a solo show of selected works produced throughout his career titled 'The Joy of Colour' at Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery in Seaforth, making this exhibition his first solo show within a commercial gallery that Ken Done has exhibited outside of his personally owned gallery located in The Rocks, Sydney. Design company Ken Done created a design company called \\"Done Art and Design\\" with his wife Judy Done. The company started out by producing small runs of T-shirts featuring Done's art and the garment design of his wife Judy. In 1993 the company won the Fashion Industries of Australia's, Grand Award. An original Ken Done work featured on the cover of the Japanese women's magazine Hanako every week between 1989 and 1999.Ken Done The Blue Dot Gallery Advocacy Done at Mosman Art Gallery in 2010 He became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1988, and won the Australian father of the year award in 1989. During October 1995, Done was asked to create a series of flag designs by the then Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. Republicanism in Australia was news at the time and Done submitted sixteen designs to Ausflag, some of which he had created as early as 1981.Ken Done's Flag Gallery Ausflag He was commissioned to produce a series of works for both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympic games. Ken Done has long been a supporter of art in Australia especially encouraging school students through awards and sponsorships, although Done decided to sue Australian band TISM for appropriating his work on an album cover. The album formerly named Australia the Lucky Cunt was released in September 1993 and depicted a Done-style koala with a syringe in its mouth. Done was angered by this use and obtained an injunction order to ban the sale of the album. The album was then re-released in November under the a new title Censored Due to Legal Advice and a new cover depicting four edited pictures depicting Irish singer Sin√©ad O'Connor on the TV show Saturday Night Live when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II. The images are edited to show the singer tearing up a sheet with TISM's logo and the album's new name on it. In 2006 he designed and created the United Buddy Bear for Australia. Expo 88 Legacy Ken Done Sign It was as a result of the commission to design the Entrance and exit statement at the Australian Pavilion, at World Expo 88, that he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1988. That Statement became one of the most iconic parts and memories of Expo 88. He donated in effect the Signs to a college to the north of Brisbane. Of recent years the signs have sat rusting away, that was until, one student by the name of Kurt Jones, at the College, started a social media storm. A local purchased the signs and donated them to the Caboolture Historical Village. After a massive Six-month effort by the Caboolture Historical Village (https://www.historicalvillage.com.au/), they were unveiled, fully restored by Ken Done AM and Sallyanne Atkinson AO, on the 28th of October 2018, as the centrepiece event in the closing of the 30th Anniversary of Expo 88.

A lot of the things that I do, it's not all art. Some of it's design, some of it's illustration, some of it's graphics, some of it's concept, some of it's business and some of it, hopefully, is art. * Art shouldn't be something that you go quietly into an art gallery and dip your forelock and say 'I have to be very quiet, I'm in here amongst the art.' It's here, art's everywhere. It's how you use your eyes. It's about the enjoyment of visual things. And it's certainly not for any one group of people. * I've always thought that there shouldn't be any limit to the things that are well designed. And I think that people who consider that art should only be kept for art galleries and doesn't have a role in public life, I think that's too narrow. * In the times in which we live it is far too restricting to say that art can only be found in art galleries and not touch people's everyday lives.. I want to use any means that are necessary to communicate to people what I feel about things. There are no rules. And if there are rules, then you may as well break them. * Wherever you are in the world, there's always something about the Australian light. There's something about the sharpness of it, something about the clarity of it, something about the colours of Australia. And, hopefully, something optimistic about Australian painting too.Ken Done quotes References External links * Personal site * Done Design website 1940 births Living people Australian painters Clothing brands Members of the Order of Australia National Art School alumni ","title":"Ken Done"},{"id":"1788614","text":"The 84th Grey Cup, also known as The Snow Bowl, was the 1996 Grey Cup Canadian Football League championship game played between the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario.

Tractors had to remove snow from the field prior to the game, as well as at halftime. Edmonton had all the points in the first quarter on a safety touch conceded by Toronto quarterback Doug Flutie and a 64-yard touchdown pass from Danny McManus to Eddie Brown, a shoestring catch that slipped through his hands then bounced off his right thigh and left shin before he caught it on the fly. It is considered to be of the most memorable plays in Grey Cup history. In the second quarter, Toronto's Mike Vanderjagt kicked a field goal and Jimmy Cunningham returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown. Another Vanderjagt field goal put Toronto up 13‚Äì9. Edmonton regained the lead with a 75-yard pass and run from McManus to Jim Sandusky but lost it again when Robert Drummond scored for Toronto from the one. Edmonton's Henry \\"Gizmo\\" Williams reversed that in one play as he returned the kickoff 91 yards for the touchdown, a Grey Cup record that stood until the Eskimos' Tony Tompkins topped it with a 95-yard kickoff return in the 93rd Grey Cup. Flutie marched the Argos to the Edmonton 10 then ran in himself for the touchdown with 20 seconds left in the half to give Toronto the lead 27‚Äì23 at halftime, closing a quarter that saw the teams combine for 41 points. Two Vanderjagt field goals were all the scoring in the first 23 minutes of the second half as Toronto receiver Cunningham dropped certain touchdown passes in the third and fourth quarters. Edmonton cut the Toronto lead to 33‚Äì30 on Eric Blount's five-yard touchdown run with seven minutes remaining. But Flutie marched Toronto 71 yards, including a controversial third-down gamble in which Flutie fumbled the snap but was ruled not only to have retained possession but to have gained a first down. Their drive thus extended, the Argonauts increased their lead to 36‚Äì30 on Vanderjagt's 27-yard field goal at 13:26. Toronto's Adrion Smith iced the win, returning a Danny McManus interception 49 yards for a touchdown with 1:22 remaining. McManus hit Marc Tolbert with a seven-yard touchdown pass at 14:51 to round out the scoring at 43‚Äì37. A short kickoff attempt was recovered by Toronto to end any Edmonton comeback threat. 1996 CFL Playoffs =West Division= * Semi-final (November 10 @ Edmonton, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 68-7 Winnipeg Blue Bombers * Final (November 17 @ Calgary, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 15-12 Calgary Stampeders =East Division= * Semi-final (November 9 @ Montreal, Quebec) Montreal Alouettes 22-11 Hamilton Tiger-Cats * Final (November 16 @ Toronto, Ontario) Toronto Argonauts 43-7 Montreal Alouettes In popular culture The game serves as a key plot point to a 2013 episode of the American TV series How I Met Your Mother.

It works by only presenting the image intended for the left eye while blocking the right eye's view, then presenting the right-eye image while blocking the left eye, and repeating this so rapidly that the interruptions do not interfere with the perceived fusion of the two images into a single 3D image. Modern active shutter 3D systems generally use liquid crystal shutter glasses (also called \\"LC shutter glasses\\"\\"LC shutter glasses provide 3-D display for simulated flight\\", Information Display Magazine, Vol. 2, Issue 9, September 1986 or \\"active shutter glasses\\"\\"Active Shutter 3D Technology for HDTV\\", PhysOrg, September 25, 2009). Each eye's glass contains a liquid crystal layer which has the property of becoming opaque when voltage is applied, being otherwise transparent. The glasses are controlled by a timing signal that allows the glasses to alternately block one eye, and then the other, in synchronization with the refresh rate of the screen. The timing synchronization to the video equipment may be achieved via a wired signal, or wirelessly by either an infrared or radio frequency (e.g. Bluetooth, DLP link) transmitter. Historic systems also used spinning discs, for example the Teleview system. Active shutter 3D systems are used to present 3D films in some theaters, and they can be used to present 3D images on CRT, plasma, LCD, projectors and other types of video displays.  Advantages and disadvantages  Although virtually all ordinary unmodified video and computer systems can be used to display 3D by adding a plug-in interface and active shutter glasses, disturbing levels of flicker or ghosting may be apparent with systems or displays not designed for such use. The rate of alternation required to completely eliminate noticeable flicker depends on image brightness and other factors, but is typically well over 30 image pair cycles per second, the maximum possible with a 60 Hz display. A 120 Hz display, allowing 60 images per second per eye, is widely accepted as flicker-free. =Advantages= * Unlike red/cyan color filter (anaglyph) 3D glasses, LC shutter glasses are color neutral, enabling 3D viewing in the full color spectrum, though the ColorCode anaglyph system does come very close to providing full color resolution. * Unlike in a Polarized 3D system, where the (usually) horizontal spatial resolution is halved, the active shutter system can retain full resolution (1080p) for both the left and right images. Like any system, manufacturers of televisions may choose not to implement the full resolution for 3D playback but use halved vertical resolution (540p) instead.Investigation: Active 3D TVs, Full HD 3D Guaranteed? Digitalversus.com. 5 December 2011. (Archived.) =Disadvantages= * Flicker can be noticed except at very high refresh rates, as each eye is effectively receiving only half of the monitor's actual refresh rate. However, modern LC glasses generally work in higher refresh rates and eliminate this problem for most people. * Until recently, the method only worked with CRT monitors; some modern flat-panel monitors now support high-enough refresh rates to work with some LC shutter systems. Many projectors, especially DLP-based ones, support 3D out of the box. * LC shutter glasses are shutting out light half of the time; moreover, they are slightly dark even when letting light through, because they are polarized. This gives an effect similar to watching TV with sunglasses on, which causes a darker picture to be perceived by the viewer. However, this effect can produce a higher perceived display contrast when paired with LCDs because of the reduction in backlight bleed. Since the glasses also darken the background, contrast is enhanced when using a brighter image. * When used with LCDs, extreme localized differences between the image to be displayed in one eye and the other may lead to crosstalk, due to LCD panels' pixels sometimes being unable to fully switch, for example from black to white, in the time that separates the left eye's image from the right one. Recent advancements in the panel's response time, however, has led to displays that rival or even surpass passive 3D systems. * Frame rate has to be double that of a non-3D, anaglyph, or polarized 3D systems to get an equivalent result. All equipment in the chain has to be able to process frames at double rate; in essence this doubles the hardware requirements. * Despite a progressive fall in prices, due to the intrinsic use of electronics, they remain more expensive than anaglyph and polarized 3D glasses. * Because of their integrated electronics and batteries, early shutter glasses were heavy and expensive. However, design improvements have resulted in newer models that are cheaper, lightweight, rechargeable and able to be worn over prescription lenses. * From brand to brand, shutter glasses use different synchronization methods and protocols. Therefore, even glasses that use the same kind of synchronization system (e.g. infrared) will probably be incompatible across different makers. However, efforts are being made to create a universal 3D shutter glass.Universal 3D Shutter Glass . * Alternated viewing of left and right views leads to an effect of time parallax, if there are side moving objects in the scene: they are seen as in front or behind their actual location, according to the move direction. Crosstalk Crosstalk is the leakage of frames between left eye and right eye.3D crosstalk during shutter glasses operation LCDs have exhibited this problem more often than plasma and DLP displays, due to slower pixel response time. LCDs that utilize a strobe backlight,High speed video of nVidia LightBoost, illustrating strobe backlight action such as nVidia's LightBoost,nVidia LightBoost backlight reduce crosstalk. This is done by turning off the backlight between refreshes, while waiting for the shutter glasses to switch eyes, and also for the LCD panel to finish pixel transitions. Standards In March 2011 Panasonic Corporation, together with XPAND 3D, have formulated the M-3DI Standard, which aims to provide industry-wide compatibility and standardization of LC Shutter Glasses. This movement aims to bring about compatibility among manufacturers of 3D TV, computer, notebook, home projection, and cinema with standardized LC shutter glasses that will work across all 3D hardware seamlessly. The current standard is Full HD 3D Glasses. Field Sequential has been used in video games, VHS and VHD movies and is often referred to as HQFS for DVDs, these systems use wired or wireless LCS glasses. The Sensio format was used with DVDs using wireless LCS glasses. Each different active 3D shutter glasses implementation can operate in their own manufacturer-set frequency to match the refresh rate of the display or projector. Therefore, to achieve compatibility across different brands, certain glasses have been developed to be able to adjust to a broad range of frequencies.HDfury (downloaded 25 July 2013)XPAND (downloaded 25 July 2013) Timeline The principle made its public debut remarkably early. In 1922, the Teleview 3-D system was installed in a single theater in New York City. Several short films and one feature-length film were shown by running left-eye and right-eye prints in a pair of interlocked projectors with their shutters operating out of phase. Each seat in the auditorium was equipped with a viewing device containing a rapidly rotating mechanical shutter synchronized with the projector shutters. The system worked, but the expense of the installation and the unwieldiness of the viewers, which had to be supported on adjustable stands, confined its use to this one engagement. In recent decades, the availability of lightweight optoelectronic shutters has led to an updated revival of this display method. Liquid crystal shutter glasses were first invented by Stephen McAllister of Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation in the mid-1970s. The prototype had the LCDs mounted to a small cardboard box using duct tape. The glasses were never commercialized due to ghosting, but E&S; was a very early adopter of third-party glasses such as the StereoGraphics CrystalEyes in the mid-1980s. In 1985 3D VHD players became available in Japan from manufacturers such as Victor (JVC), National (Panasonic), and Sharp. Other units were available for field sequential VHS tapes including the Realeyes 3D. A few kits were made available to watch field sequential DVDs. Sensio released their own format which was higher quality than the High Quality Field Sequential (HQFS) DVDs. =Games= SegaScope 3-D Glasses, released in 1987 Famicom 3D System, released in 1987 for Japan only The method of alternating frames can be used to render modern 3D games into true 3D, although a similar method involving alternate fields has been used to give a 3D illusion on consoles as old as the Master System and Family Computer. Special software or hardware is used generate two channels of images, offset from each other to create the stereoscopic effect. High frame rates (typically ~100fps) are required to produce seamless graphics, as the perceived frame rate will be half the actual rate (each eye sees only half the total number of frames). Again, LCD shutter glasses synchronized with the graphics chip complete the effect. In 1982, Sega's arcade video game SubRoc-3D came with a special 3D eyepiece, which was a viewer with spinning discs to alternate left and right images to the player's eye from a single monitor.Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), Video game theory reader two, p. 158, Taylor & Francis, The game's active shutter 3D system was jointly developed by Sega with Matsushita (now Panasonic).http://flyers.arcade- museum.com/?page=thumbs&db;=videodb&id;=1106 In 1984, Milton Bradley released the 3D Imager, a primitive form of active shutter glasses that used a motorized rotating disc with transparencies as physical shutters, for the Vectrex. Although bulky and crude, they used the same basic principle of rapidly alternating imagery that modern active shutter glasses still use. Sega released the SegaScope 3-D for the Master System in 1987, where it was the first known electronic device to use LCD Active Shutter glasses. Only eight 3D compatible games were ever released. Nintendo's Famicom also featured a similar Famicom 3D System, which was an LCD shutter headset, released in 1987 only for Japan. In 1993 Pioneer released the LaserActive system which had a bay for various \\"PAC's\\" such as the Mega LD PAC and LD-ROM¬≤ PAC. The unit was 3D capable with the addition of the LaserActive 3D goggles (GOL-1) and the adapter (ADP-1). While the 3D hardware for these earlier video game systems is almost entirely in the hands of collectors it is still possible to play the games in 3D using emulators, for example using a Sega Dreamcast with a Sega Master System emulator in conjunction with a CRT television and a 3D system like the one found in The Ultimate 3-D Collection. In 1999‚Äì2000, a number of companies created stereoscopic LC shutter glasses kits for the Windows PCs which worked with application and games written for Direct3D and OpenGL 3D graphics APIs. These kits only worked with CRT computer displays and employed either VGA pass-through, VESA Stereo or proprietary interface for left‚Äìright synchronization. The most prominent example was the ELSA Revelator glasses, which worked exclusively in Nvidia cards through a proprietary interface based on VESA Stereo. Nvidia later bought the technology and used it in its stereo driver for Windows. The glasses kits came with driver software which intercepted API calls and effectively rendering the two views in sequence; this technique required twice the performance from the graphic card, so a high-end device was needed. Visual glitches were common, as many 3D game engines relied on 2D effects which were rendered at the incorrect depth, causing disorientation for the viewer. Very few CRT displays were able to support a 120 Hz refresh rate at common gaming resolutions of the time, so high-end CRT display was required for a flicker-free image; and even with a capable CRT monitor, many users reported flickering and headaches. These CRT kits were entirely incompatible with common LCD monitors which had very high pixel response times, unlike CRT displays. Moreover, the display market swiftly shifted to LCD monitors and most display makers ceased production of CRT monitors in early 2000s, which meant that PC glasses kits shortly fell into disuse and were reduced to a very niche market, requiring a purchase of a used high-end, big diagonal CRT monitor. SplitFish EyeFX 3D was a stereo 3D shutter glasses kit for the Sony PlayStation 2 released in 2005; it only supported standard-definition CRT TVs. The accessory included a pass-through cable for the PS2 gamepad; when activated, the attached accessory would issue a sequence of rapidly alternating left‚Äìright movement commands to the console, producing a kind of \\"wiggle stereoscopy\\" effect additionally aided by the wired LC shutter glasses which worked in sync with these movements. The kit arrived too late in the product cycle of the console when it was effectively replaced by the PlayStation 3, and only a few games were supported, so it was largely ignored by gamers. The USB-based Nvidia 3D Vision kit released in 2008 supports CRT monitors capable of 100, 110, or 120 Hz refresh rates, as well as 120 Hz LCD monitors. Hardware =Active shutter 3D system providers= There are many sources of low-cost 3D glasses. IO glasses are the most common glasses in this category. XpanD 3D is a manufacturer of shutter glasses, with over 1000 cinemas currently using XpanD glasses.\\"The best is yet to come: 3D technology continues to evolve and win audience approval\\" , January 1, 2010 With the release of this technology to the home-viewer market as of 2009, many other manufacturers are now developing their own LC shutter glasses, such as Unipolar International Limited, Accupix Co., Ltd, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony. The M-3DI Standard, announced by Panasonic Corporation together with XPAND 3D in March 2011, aims to provide industry-wide compatibility and standardization of LC (Active) Shutter Glasses. Samsung has developed active 3D glasses that are and utilize lens and frame technology pioneered by Silhouette, who creates glasses for NASA.\\"Samsung crafts 'world's lightest' 3D glasses in partnership with Silhouette\\", Jan.3, 2011 Nvidia makes a 3D Vision kit for the PC; it comes with 3D shutter glasses, a transmitter, and special graphics driver software. While regular LCD monitors run at 60 Hz, a 120 Hz monitor is required to use 3D Vision. Other well known providers of active 3D glasses include EStar America and Optoma. Both companies produce 3D Glasses compatible with a variety of technologies, including RF, DLP Link and Bluetooth. =DLP 3D= In 2007, Texas Instruments introduced stereo 3D capable DLP solutions to its OEMs, Samsung and Mitsubishi then introduced the first 3D ready DLP televisions, and DLP 3D projectors came later. These solutions utilize the inherent speed advantage of the Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) to sequentially generate a high refresh rate for the left and right views required for stereoscopic imaging. DLP 3D technology uses the SmoothPicture wobulation algorithm and relies on the properties of modern 1080p60 DMD imagers. It effectively compacts two L/R views into a single frame by using a checkerboard pattern, only requiring a standard 1080p60 resolution for stereoscopic transmission to the TV. The claimed advantage of this solution is increased spatial resolution, unlike other methods which cut vertical or horizontal resolution in half. The micromirrors are organized in a so-called \\"offset-diamond pixel layout\\" of 960√ó1080 micromirrors, rotated 45 degrees, with their center points placed in the center of \\"black\\" squares on the checkerboard. The DMD employs full-pixel wobulation to display the complete 1080p image as two half-resolution images in a fast sequence. The DMD operates at twice the refresh rate, i.e. 120 Hz, and the complete 1080p picture is displayed in two steps. On the first cadence, only half of the original 1080p60 image is displayed ‚Äì the pixels that correspond to the \\"black\\" squares of the checkerboard pattern. On the second cadence, the DMD array is mechanically shifted (\\"wobulated\\") by one pixel, so the micromirrors are now in a position previously occupied by the gaps, and another half of the image is displayed ‚Äì this time, the pixels that correspond to the \\"white\\" squares. A synchronization signal is then generated to synchronize the screen's refresh with LC shutter glasses worn by the viewer, using Texas Instruments' proprietary mechanism called DLP Link. DLP Link keeps sync by embedding briefly-flashed white frames during the display's blanking interval, which are picked up by the LC shutter glasses. =Plasma TV= Plasma display panels are inherently high-speed devices as well, since they use pulse-width modulation to maintain the brightness of individual pixels, making them compatible with sequential method involving shutter glasses. Modern panels feature pixel driving frequency of up to 600 Hz and allow 10-bit to 12-bit color precision with 1024 to 4096 gradations of brightness for each subpixel. Samsung Electronics launched 3D ready PDP TVs in 2008, a \\"PAVV Cannes 450\\" in Korea and PNAx450 in the UK and the US. The sets utilize the same checkerboard pattern compression scheme as their DLP TVs, though only at the native resolution of 1360√ó768 pixels and not at HDTV standard 720p, making them only usable with a PC. Matsushita Electric (Panasonic) prototyped the \\"3D Full-HD Plasma Theater System\\" on CES 2008. The system is a combination of a 103-inch PDP TV, a Blu-ray Disc player and shutter glasses. The new system transmits 1080i60 interlaced images for both right and left eyes, and the video is stored on 50-gigabyte Blu-ray using the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression Multiview Video Coding extension. =LCD= Formerly, LCDs were not very suitable for stereoscopic 3D due to slow pixel response time. Liquid crystal displays have traditionally been slow to change from one polarization state to another. Users of early 1990s laptops are familiar with the smearing and blurring that occurs when something moves too fast for the LCD to keep up. LCD technology is not usually rated by frames per second but rather the time it takes to transition from one pixel color value to another pixel color value. Normally, a 120 Hz refresh is displayed for a full 1/120 second (8.33 milliseconds) due to sample-and-hold, regardless of how quickly an LCD can complete pixel transitions. Recently, it became possible to hide pixel transitions from being seen, using strobe backlight technology, by turning off the backlight between refreshes,AnandTech article, mentioning the LightBoost strobe backlight technique to reduce crosstalk. Newer LCD televisions, including high end Sony and Samsung 3D TVs, now utilize a strobed backlight or scanning backlight to reduce 3D crosstalk during shutter glasses operation. Therapeutic alternating occlusion In vision therapy of amblyopia and of intermittent central suppression, liquid crystal devices have been used for purposes of enhanced occlusion therapy. In this scenario, the amblyopic patient wears electronically programmable liquid crystal glasses or goggles for continuously for several hours during regular everyday activities. Wearing the device encourages or forces the patient to use both eyes alternatingly, similar to eye patching, but rapidly alternating in time. The aim is to circumvent the patient's tendency to suppress the field of view of the weaker eye and to train the patient's capacity for binocular vision. The goggles mostly feature a much slower flicker rate than the more well-known active shutter 3D glasses.

A polarized 3D system uses polarization glasses to create the illusion of three-dimensional images by restricting the light that reaches each eye (an example of stereoscopy). To present stereoscopic images and films, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen or display through different polarizing filters. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which contain a pair of different polarizing filters. As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized in the opposite direction, each eye sees a different image. This is used to produce a three-dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes, but depicted from slightly different perspectives. Multiple people can view the stereoscopic images at the same time.  Types of polarised glasses  = Linearly polarised glasses = To present a stereoscopic motion picture, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through orthogonal polarizing filters (Usually at 45 and 135 degrees).Make Your own Stereo Pictures Julius B. Kaiser The Macmillan Company 1955 page 271 The viewer wears linearly polarized eyeglasses which also contain a pair of orthogonal polarizing filters oriented the same as the projector. As each filter only passes light which is similarly polarised and blocks the orthogonally polarized light, each eye only sees one of the projected images, and the 3D effect is achieved. Linearly polarised glasses require the viewer to keep his or her head level, as tilting of the viewing filters will cause the images of the left and right channels to bleed over to the opposite channel. This can make prolonged viewing uncomfortable as head movement is limited to maintain the 3D effect. A linear polariser converts an unpolarised beam into one with a single linear polarisation. The vertical components of all waves are transmitted, while the horizontal components are absorbed and reflected. = Circularly polarized glasses = To present a stereoscopic motion picture, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through circular polarizing filters of opposite handedness. The viewer wears eyeglasses which contain a pair of analyzing filters (circular polarizers mounted in reverse) of opposite handedness. Light that is left- circularly polarized is blocked by the right-handed analyzer, while right- circularly polarized light is blocked by the left-handed analyzer. The result is similar to that of stereoscopic viewing using linearly polarized glasses, except the viewer can tilt his or her head and still maintain left/right separation (although stereoscopic image fusion will be lost due to the mismatch between the eye plane and the original camera plane). Circular polarizer passing left-handed, counter-clockwise circularly polarized light As shown in the figure, the analyzing filters are constructed of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a linearly polarized filter (LPF). The QWP always transforms circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. However, the angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light produced by a QWP depends on the handedness of the circularly polarized light entering the QWP. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the analyzing filter is transformed by the QWP into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the LPF. Therefore, in this case the light passes through the LPF. In contrast, right- handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the LPF, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked. By rotating either the QWP or the LPF by 90 degrees about an axis perpendicular to its surface (i.e. parallel to the direction of propagation of the light wave), one may build an analyzing filter which blocks left-handed, rather than right-handed circularly polarized light. Rotating both the QWP and the LPF by the same angle does not change the behaviour of the analyzing filter.  System construction and examples  Functional principle of polarized 3D systems Polarized light reflected from an ordinary motion picture screen typically loses most of its polarization, but the loss is negligible if a silver screen or aluminized screen is used. This means that a pair of aligned DLP projectors, some polarizing filters, a silver screen, and a computer with a dual-head graphics card can be used to form a relatively high-cost (over US$10,000 in 2010) system for displaying stereoscopic 3D data simultaneously to a group of people wearing polarized glasses. In the case of RealD 3D a circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity 144 times per second is placed in front of the projector lens. Only one projector is needed, as the left and right eye images are displayed alternately. Sony features a new system called RealD XLS, which shows both circularly polarized images simultaneously: A single 4K projector displays two 2K images one above the other, a special lens attachment polarizes and projects the images on top of each other. Optical attachments can be added to traditional 35 mm projectors to adapt them for projecting film in the \\"over-and-under\\" format, in which each pair of images is stacked within one frame of film. The two images are projected through different polarizers and superimposed on the screen. This is a very cost-effective way to convert a theater for 3-D as all that is needed are the attachments and a non- depolarizing screen surface, rather than a conversion to digital 3-D projection. Thomson Technicolor currently produces an adapter of this type. When stereo images are to be presented to a single user, it is practical to construct an image combiner, using partially silvered mirrors and two image screens at right angles to one another. One image is seen directly through the angled mirror whilst the other is seen as a reflection. Polarized filters are attached to the image screens and appropriately angled filters are worn as glasses. A similar technique uses a single screen with an inverted upper image, viewed in a horizontal partial reflector, with an upright image presented below the reflector, again with appropriate polarizers. = On TV and computer screens = Polarizing techniques are easier to apply with cathode ray tube (CRT) technology than with Liquid crystal display (LCD). Ordinary LCD screens already contain polarizers for control of pixel presentation ‚Äî this can interfere with these techniques. In 2003 Keigo Iizuka discovered an inexpensive implementation of this principle on laptop computer displays using cellophane sheets. One can construct a low cost polarized projection system by using a computer with two projectors and an aluminium foil screen. The dull side of aluminium foil is brighter than most silver screens. This was demonstrated at PhraJomGlao University, N√¥nthaburi, Thailand, September 2009. = Health care = In optometry and ophthalmology, polarized glasses are used for various tests of binocular depth perception (i.e. stereopsis).  History  Polarized 3-D projection was demonstrated experimentally in the 1890s. The projectors used Nicol Prisms for polarization. Packs of thin glass sheets, angled so as to reflect away light of the unwanted polarity, served as the viewing filters.Zone, Ray (2007). Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838‚Äì1952, University Press of Kentucky, pp. 64-66. Polarized 3-D glasses only became practical after the invention of Polaroid plastic sheet polarizers by Edwin Land, who was privately demonstrating their use for projecting and viewing 3-D images in 1934.Zone, op. cit., p. 150 They were first used to show a 3-D movie to the general public at \\"Polaroid on Parade\\", a New York Museum of Science and Industry exhibit that opened in December 1936. 16 mm Kodachrome color film was used.McElheny, Victor K (1998). Insisting On the Impossible, The Life of Edwin Land, Inventor of Instant Photography, Perseus Books, p. 114Zone, op. cit., pp. 152-153Note: some sources state that the Italian feature film Nozze Vagabonde, filmed in 3-D in 1936, was shown by polarized projection in that year, but no contemporary evidence of any kind has yet been presented to support the claim; other sources state that anaglyph projection was used, or that the 3-D version was never shown to the public at all. Sources agree that polarized projection was used for the German short Zum Greifen nah, filmed in 1936 with a single-strip 3-D system, but it was not shown to the public until 1937. Details about the glasses are not available. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a short polarized 3-D film was shown at the Chrysler Motors pavilion and seen by thousands of visitors daily. The hand-held cardboard viewers, a free souvenir, were die-cut in the shape of a 1939 Plymouth seen head-on. Their Polaroid filters, stapled over rectangular openings where the headlights ought to be, were very small.Zone, op. cit., p. 158 illustrates the viewers given out during the 1940 season of the Fair. The 1939 variety depicted the earlier model car head-on but the filters were identical. Cardboard glasses with earpieces and larger filters were used to watch Bwana Devil, the feature-length color 3-D film that premiered on 26 November 1952 and ignited the brief but intense 3-D fad of the 1950s. The well-known Life magazine photo of an audience wearing 3-D glasses was one of a series taken at the premiere.Getty Images #2905087 One of several photographs taken by J. R. Eyerman at the Bwana Devil premiere. Getty Images #50611221 One of several photographs taken by J. R. Eyerman at the Bwana Devil premiere. The film's title, imprinted on the earpieces, is plainly visible in high-resolution copies of those images. Imaginatively colorized versions have helped to spread the myth that the 3-D movies of the 1950s were projected by the anaglyph color filter method. In fact, during the 1950s anaglyph projection was used only for a few short films. Beginning in the 1970s, some 1950s 3-D feature films were re-released in anaglyph form so that they could be shown without special projection equipment. There was no commercial advantage in advertising the fact that it was not the original release format. Polaroid filters in disposable cardboard frames were typical during the 1950s, but more comfortable plastic frames with somewhat larger filters, considerably more expensive for the theater owner, were also in use. Patrons were normally instructed to turn them in when leaving so that they could be sanitized and reissued, and it was not uncommon for ushers to be stationed at the exits to attempt to collect them from forgetful or souvenir-loving patrons. Cardboard and plastic frames continued to co-exist during the following decades, with one or the other favored by a particular film distributor or theater or for a particular release. Specially imprinted or otherwise custom-made glasses were sometimes used. Some showings of Andy Warhol's Frankenstein during its 1974 U.S. first run featured unusual glasses consisting of two stiff plastic polarizers held together by two thin silver plastic tubes slit lengthwise, one attached across the tops and bent at the temples to form earpieces, the other a short length bent in the middle and serving as the bridge piece. The design managed to be both stylish in an appropriately Warholesque way and self- evidently simple to manufacture from the raw sheet and tube stock. Linear polarization was standard into the 1980s and beyond. In the 2000s, computer animation, digital projection, and the use of sophisticated IMAX 70 mm film projectors, have created an opportunity for a new wave of polarized 3D films.Manjoo, Farhad. A look at Disney and Pixar's 3-D movie technology. 2008.04.09. Downloaded 2009.06.07 In the 2000s, RealD Cinema and MasterImage 3D were introduced, both using circular polarization. At IBC 2011 in Amsterdam RAI several companies, including Sony, Panasonic, JVC & others highlighted their upcoming 3D stereoscopic product portfolios for both the professional and consumer markets to use the same polarization technique as RealD 3D Cinema uses for stereoscopy. These highlighted products cover everything from recording, projecting, viewing and digital display technologies to live, recorded and pre- and post production facilities and soft- and hardware based product to facilitate 3D content creation. Their systems are interoperable and compatible with existing, passive RealD 3D glasses.  Advantages and disadvantages  Compared to anaglyph images, the use of polarized 3D glasses produces a full-color image that is considerably more comfortable to watch and is not subject to binocular rivalry. However, it requires a significant increase in expense: even the low cost polarized glasses typically cost 50% more than comparable red-cyan filters,Price list showing paper linear polarized glasses at 3 for $2, anaglyph 2 for $1 http://www.berezin.com/3d/3dglasses.htm and while anaglyph 3-D films can be printed on one line of film, a polarized film was often done with a special set up that uses two projectors. The use of multiple projectors also raises issues with synchronization, and a poorly synchronized film would negate any increased comfort from the use of polarization. This problem was solved by a number of single strip polarized systems which were standard in the 1980s. Particularly with the linear polarization schemes popular since the 1950s, the use of linear polarization meant that a level head was required for any sort of comfortable viewing; any effort to tilt the head sideways would result in the polarization failing, ghosting, and both eyes seeing both images. Circular polarization has alleviated this problem, allowing viewers to tilt their heads slightly (although any offset between the eye plane and the original camera plane will still interfere with the perception of depth). Because neutral-gray linear-polarizing filters are easily manufactured, correct color rendition is possible. Circular-polarizing filters often have a slight brownish tint, which may be compensated for during projection. Until 2011, home 3D television and home 3D computer primarily used active shutter glasses with LCD or plasma displays. TV manufacturers (LG, Vizio) have introduced displays with horizontal polarizing stripes overlaying the screen. The stripes alternate polarization with each line. This permits using relatively inexpensive passive viewing glasses, similar to those for movies. The principal disadvantage is that each polarization can display only half as many scanning lines. = Advantages = * Generally inexpensive. * Do not require power. * Do not require a transmitter to synchronize them with the display. * Do not suffer from flicker. * Lightweight. * Comfortable. = Disadvantages = * The images for polarized glasses have to share the screen simultaneously in which full, native resolution is downgraded, compromising picture quality of both sides of the image delivered to each eye simultaneously. A full 1080p picture results from image fusion.http://hdguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Intertek-LG- FPR-Report-.jpg This disadvantage does not occur on projections where each pixel can contain information for both eyes. * Associated with the headaches many people attribute to 3D viewing. * Narrow vertical viewing angles compared to Active shutter 3D  See also  * Vectograph  References   External links  * \\"Experiments With Polarized Light\\" by Donald E.

The strip follows the escapades of a red-haired prepubescent mischief-maker who lives in an inner suburban working-class household. While employed at The Bulletin, Bancks submitted cartoons to the Sydney Sunday Sun, where he began his Us Fellers strip in 1921 in the \\"Sunbeams\\" section of the Sunday Sun. Ginger first appeared in Us Fellers on 13 November 1921, drawn by Bancks.Lambiek When Bancks died on 1 July 1952 from a heart attack, Ron Vivian took over the strip (1953-1973), followed by Lloyd Piper(1973-1982), James Kemsley (1983-2007) and since 2007, Jason Chatfield. Publication history Bancks created, wrote, drew and syndicated Ginger Meggs from 1921 until 1952, when he died unexpectedly of a heart attack. The character was based on Bancks's best friend, Charlie Somerville. The latter was a resident of the Sydney suburb of Hornsby, who went on to become a businessman and councillor.Sydney Morning Herald, 2015-3-23, p.6 After Bancks's death, there was a year's worth of strips to run while another artist was found. Ron Vivian wrote and drew Ginger Meggs from 1953 until 1973. Lloyd Piper wrote and drew Ginger Meggs from 1973 until 1983, when he died in a car accident. James Kemsley wrote, drew and syndicated Ginger Meggs from 1984‚Äì2007. On 3 December 2007, Kemsley died at his home in Welby, New South Wales. In the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honour lists, the Australian Government posthumously recognised Kemsley for his efforts with the Medal of the Order of Australia. Jason Chatfield has written and drawn Ginger Meggs since 2007. The strip remains the most widely syndicated Australian comic strip today, appearing in over 120 newspapers in 34 countries. In 1997, a park in Valley Road, Hornsby, was officially named Ginger Meggs Park. Bancks had spent much time in the area during his childhood. Commemoratives In 1985, a postage stamp honouring Ginger or his creator was issued by Australia Post as part of a set of five commemorating children's books.Australian Stamps On 1 July 2011, the Perth Mint, released a commemorative 1oz Silver Australian $1 coin to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Ginger Meggs. The coin features an homage to James C. Bancks' 1945 Sunbeams Annual (Series 22) cover, which featured Ginger Meggs on the back of a kangaroo with his dog, Mike and his pet monkey, Tony. The obverse portrays the Ian Rank-Broadley effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the 2011 year-date and is issued as legal tender under the Australian Currency Act 1965.

This genre of magazine flourished in North America in the 1950s and early 1960s. The title Confidential alone boasted a monthly circulation in excess of ten million, and it had many competitors, with names such as Whisper, Dare, Suppressed, The Lowdown, Hush-Hush, and Uncensored. These magazines included more lurid and explicit content than tabloid newspaper gossip columnist reporters presented during those years, including tales of celebrity homosexuality and illegal drug use. History Actress Seena Owen, on the cover of the November 1922 Broadway Brevities The publication generally credited as America's first national weekly gossip tabloid is Broadway Brevities and Society Gossip, which was launched in New York in 1916 and edited by a Canadian named Stephen G. Clow. Brevities started out covering high society and the A-list of the New York theater world, but by the 1920s focused on society scandal and the destruction of reputations culminating in its editor, Stephen Clow, and two of his associates being charged with using the mails to defraud due to allegations that the magazine was a blackmail racket threatening to publish material injurious to the reputations of businesses and individuals unless they purchased advertising. The tabloid was consequently shut down in 1925 after Clow and his associates were convicted with Clow sentenced to six years in prison (serving two). Clow revived the tabloid in 1930 and the new incarnation covered more general vice and ran splashy, highly sensationalized features on sex, drugs, gang violence and crime. This was possibly the first time a gossip magazine had made real efforts to attract readers who weren't members of the elite classes; it didn't presume its readers had a close familiarity with any given social or professional world. In 1932, New York City banned newsstands from selling the racy tabloid, and it appears to have folded sometime around 1933. A third incarnation of the tabloid was printed in Toronto from 1937, with Clow as editor initially, until around 1948. Modern The large-circulation gossip magazines eventually gave way to supermarket tabloids, such as the National Enquirer, and to less scandal-oriented celebrity coverage in magazines such as People and Us, though small-circulation publications that harken back to the 1950s approach have continued to be published. The history of gossip magazines also includes a few eccentric titles that flouted the usual rules of acceptable taste, such as the sexually explicit Hollywood Star of the 1970s. There are nearly 400 magazines related to gossip in the news stands. Notable gossip magazines around the world include Us Weekly in the United States, Hello! in the United Kingdom, Gente and Chi in Italy, Actustar and Voici in France, Bunte in Germany, and East Touch in Hong Kong. The gossip genre has crossed over onto television and the internet with sites such as TMZ.com and its television counterpart TMZ on TV as well as Perez Hilton, The Drudge Report, and The Smoking Gun breaking many of the stories that were formerly the domain of gossip magazines and tabloids.

Originally a small device, called the video tap, was installed inside a movie camera that allows (with the addition of a monitor) the director to see approximately the same view as the camera operator, and thus ensure that the film is being shot and framed as desired. This is done by using a small charge-coupled device (CCD) (similar to ones in consumer camcorders) inside the viewfinder. On modern film cameras, the assist is fed off a beam splitter, which splits the beam between the optical viewfinder and the video tap. The light enters through the lens, and hits the rotating mirror shutter, which bounces the light to the horizontal ground glass. The beam splitter is directly over the ground glass and turns the light again 90 degrees, and projects it onto the chip of the video assist camera‚Äîthrough its own lens system. The chip, together with its electronics, lens system and mounting hardware, is the video tap, and was commonly called video assist until the video assist industry grew large. Usage and history Today, video assist is a name of a complex system, consisting of monitors, recorders, video transmitters, video printers, matrices and hundreds of yards of cables. The video assist crew‚Äîthe video assist operators‚Äîare in charge of moving, operating, and troubleshooting the whole system which can easily fill a medium-sized truck. Their job is to run cables from all of the several cameras used on the show to a central location‚Äîoften referred as the video village‚Äîwhere the director, DP and script supervisor sit. When cameras are in unreachable locations, on the move, handheld, or steadicam-mounted, wireless transmitters are often used. All the camera connections coming into the video village go into the video trolley. These come in several shapes and sizes and are often hand-built by the operator based on his/her own preferences and the needs of the show. On the cart are the video recorders, the most important equipment of a VA op. The cart usually holds a video matrix, for making quick interconnections, several small operator's monitors, a video printer, all the wireless receivers, speakers, computers, laptops, digitizing boards, UPSes, and a bunch of small tools. The camera images are then fed to the larger monitors for the director, and sometimes for a second array of monitors for the producers, clients, etc. More often than not the Director and DP request a smaller, more private monitor set, and then the second array can be watched by everyone else. Video is often fed to make-up trucks, production trailers, or separate monitors around set for cuing stunts, special effects or puppeteers. A complex video assist can have up to 20 monitors depending on the number of cameras used. Wireless handheld monitors are often used so the director can be close to the actors. On-board monitors, mounted directly on the camera, helps the focus puller to follow the shot. On steadicam and remote head or crane operation, the viewfinder and beam splitter is often removed because it's not needed. Then the full image is projected onto the video tap, making the image twice as bright, and hence better quality (lower noise). In these cases, even the camera operator uses a video monitor to operate the camera. Though the quality of the a video assist feed can vary greatly based on both the camera and the assist, it is always used as a guide and nothing more. Because the assist has its own controls for exposure, contrast, focus and color correction, it is not possible to use it to learn anything more than the frame lines. The video assist camera is usually significantly lower in resolution than the film camera as well, so critical focus is still usually determined by distance from the lens to the subject via a tape measure. Comedian and director Jerry Lewis is widely credited with inventing the precursor to this system,E.g., although some similar systems existed before Lewis first used a video camera to simultaneously record scenes alongside his film camera during production of The Bellboy in 1960.Glaskowsky, Peter. Video assist predates Jerry Lewis 'patent', CNET, Accessed on June 20, 2019. Director Blake Edwards was the first to use the beam-splitter single-camera system invented by engineer Jim Songer in the 1968 film The Party. Video assist on electronic cameras A camera's on-board monitor. While the traditional video tap no longer applies to modern CCD based cameras, large-scale productions with HD or SD cameras still use video assist in its wider meaning. In this case, the video signal is fed from the camera's own video output, and is a significantly better quality than the original video tap technology. HD cameras can output HD-SDI video signals, which, when presented on a high-grade calibrated monitor, is an almost what-you-see-is-what-you-get quality. Because the video cameras are often less tolerant of images with high contrast and quick light changes, and their behavior is harder to foresee than a film camera, DPs shooting HD cameras are often found in darkened tents, watching expensive HD monitors to make sure the image is captured correctly. This situation is getting better as newer cameras tend to simulate film gamma curves better. Other uses While very simple video assist equipment is only capable of showing a live image, the modern VA equipment does much more than that. In the past, image feed from cameras were recorded onto an inexpensive medium (usually MiniDV or Hi8). Today hard disks are used. The VA operator keeps a precise log about which take was recorded where, noting the time code or file name. He or she is then able to play back any shot in a short time, even right after the shot. This is essential for a director to show actors where to change their moves, or to recheck dialogue lines, and also helps the script supervisor. It's very easy to check shooting angles, correct overlaps, and time camera or stunt actions. The VA recorder can usually simulate the under-cranking or over-cranking of the camera, and speed up or slow down the action. Ramps (speed changes in the shot) can be shown also. The video assist gear often includes a portable editing system (usually a laptop with a digitizing box and an editing software), so rough cuts can be made by the VA operator right on set. A portable video mixer is useful to check out key, blends or pre-visualize visual effects. A video printer is often used to print out pictures or hard copies of sets, camera angles or faces for art designers, make-up artists, and storyboard artists. Sound engineers and make-up usually requests a separate, live-only feed to know what's happening in front of the cameras and so don't need to continuously pop in and out of set. 2nd units or splinter units shooting extra shots or b-roll can take away small VA recorders to record their own footage, which is then loaded into the main unit archive so it can be watched and checked against main unit footage. Video assist operators on separate units or remote locations are routinely asked to upload the feed real-time onto satellite or internet stream so the agency or the director can watch it half the world away.

It was shot in the Chicago, Illinois area, during a limited 32-day schedule. It had lukewarm reviews and low box-office receipts.  Plot  Generally, the film is a dark and quirky \\"tragicomedy\\". The \\"everyman\\" protagonist, Dr. Frank Sangster (Steve Martin), is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey (Helena Bonham Carter) comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest. That night Frank goes to Susan's hotel room to demand the empty containers, threatening that he'll call the police if she doesn't provide them. Once again, she overrides his initial intentions and seduces him - with the result that they have sex and he spends the night with her. The next day at his office, Frank is confronted by Susan's brother, Duane Ivey (Scott Caan) having a violent scene, saying: \\"Stay the hell away from my sister\\" and \\"I don't appreciate your threats\\". Duane ends the conversation with, \\"I don't ever want to see you again, because if I do, goddamn it, I'm gonna hurt you.\\" That night, Frank returns to Susan's hotel room and, assuming that Susan is the form he sees the bed, starts talking to her. The person under the blanket turns out to be not Susan but brother Duane, who leaps up and attacks Frank, attempting to strangle him. Frank takes scissors from a nearby desk and stabs Duane in the hand, impaling him and embedding the scissors. Frank flees, stopping off at a bar to calm down. On arriving at home, just minutes ahead of his girlfriend Jean (Laura Dern), he finds Duane dead on the floor. Police arrive on the scene to question Frank. Comically adding to Frank's distress and anxiety is actor Lance Phelps (Kevin Bacon), a hack actor doing research for a role, and permitted by the police to question Frank at aggressive levels that cause Frank heightened discomfort. After the police arrive and depart, Frank tells Jean about the whole ordeal. A while later, Frank is arrested for the murder of Duane Ivey based on finding Frank's teeth marks on the body - that someone else put there after killing Duane. After Frank breaks free, all of Chicago is on the look out for him. He goes to his office in the night, only to find his brother Harlan lying dead. At this point, it is revealed that Frank's girlfriend Jean is behind all of the killing. Jean had been conspiring with Harlan, whom she'd been having an affair with, to use Susan to frame Frank for selling drugs so she could take full control of the company she and Frank had started together. However, Duane came along with Susan, which was not part of the plan, and Jean ended up killing him, using Frank's dentures to make the bite marks. Unfortunately for Harlan, her plan was to eventually kill him as well with the shotgun to tie up all loose ends and make it appear that Frank killed him after Duane. Realizing he'll never be free without starting over, Frank pulls out all of his dead brother's teeth, as well as all of his own. Frank uses his dental skills to place his own teeth into his dead brother's skull, and then sets fire to the dental office with Harlan's corpse, replete with replaced teeth, left inside. Frank and Susan, now lovers, escape to France, where they live happily ever after in a little cottage on the countryside. Meanwhile, Jean's attempts to frame Frank fall apart. Unbeknownst to her, Harlan was playing with a medical video camera while he was shot and the recovered footage shows Jean firing the shotgun at the camera holder but fails to show it was Harlan who was shot. Therefore, the police wrongly assume that Jean shot Frank and arrest her.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times found the \\"screwball film noir\\" funny \\"all the way through,\\" and declared its \\"loopholes\\" forgivable for a comedy. The Los Angeles Times review had high praise for Martin's portrayal, and most of director Atkins' work, but found the appearance by Kevin Bacon \\"ludicrous\\", and the film's tension reduced by the \\"virtually slapstick run from the cops\\". Salon Magazine's review found the film \\"so aggressively stylish that it comes off more like a stunt\\", its plot \\"plodding\\", and though Laura Dern's performance made the film \\"clack along efficiently when she's onscreen,\\" with the film's \\"feebly shocking conclusion, we're left feeling heavily sedated, and not in the good way.\\" The Rotten Tomatoes review aggregator showed, among 29 \\"top\\" reviewers, 9 \\"fresh\\" and 20 \\"rotten\\" reviews.

In those days, most elementary children in rural areas attended one- room schools. A typical kid hack would serve all the farms in the area of the school, and usually transport under 20 children. The horse-drawn kid hack is considered to be the precursor to the modern yellow school bus. As early as 1914, versions of kid hacks were attached to early motor vehicles by the Wayne Works in Richmond, Indiana. As motorized trucks became more commonplace in rural locations, detachable wooden kid hack bodies were made which could be removed when the truck was in other use. Around 1927, much heavier all-steel bodies were introduced for this purpose by Wayne Works and other companies. Permanently mounted on the truck chassis, the combined vehicle became known as a school bus. The Wayne County Historical Museum in Richmond, Indiana has a restored horse-drawn \\"kid hack\\" on display.

He is most widely known for his 33-year tenure as a broadcast announcer for the Chicago White Sox. In December 2019, Harrelson was named the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually to one broadcaster for \\"major contributions to baseball\\". Early life Harrelson was born in Woodruff, South Carolina, and his family moved to Savannah, Georgia, when he was in fifth grade. As a child Harrelson was interested in basketball and he hoped to pursue a basketball scholarship from the University of Kentucky. His parents divorced when he was eight. He played golf, baseball, football and basketball at Benedictine Military School in Savannah, Georgia. Playing career Harrleson as a member of the Kansas City Athletics in 1965. Throwing and batting right-handed, Harrelson played for four teams: the Kansas City Athletics (1963‚Äì66, 1967), Washington Senators (1966‚Äì67), Boston Red Sox (1967‚Äì69), and Cleveland Indians (1969‚Äì71). In his nine-season career, Harrelson was a .239 hitter with 131 home runs and 421 RBI in 900 games. His time with the Athletics ended abruptly in when Harrelson was quoted in a Washington newspaper calling team owner Charlie Finley \\"a menace to baseball\\" following the dismissal of manager Alvin Dark. Although Harrelson denied using the word \\"menace\\", Harrelson was released and ended up signing a lucrative deal with the Boston Red Sox, who were in contention to win their first pennant since . * John E Peterson, \\"The Kansas City Athletics - A Baseball History,\\" McFarland and Company, 2003. (Chapter 26) Brought in to replace the injured Tony Conigliaro, Harrelson helped the team win the pennant, but watched the team drop the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. However, in , he had his finest season, making the American League All- Star team and leading the American League in runs batted in with 109. He also finished third in the American League Most Valuable Player balloting, with two Detroit Tigers finishing ahead of him‚Äîpitcher Denny McLain won the award and catcher Bill Freehan finished second. Harrelson announced his retirement the day after he was traded along with Dick Ellsworth and Juan Pizarro from the Red Sox to the Indians for Sonny Siebert, Vicente Romo and Joe Azcue on April 19, . He had felt that his business ventures made it impractical for him to move to any other city. His agent Bob Woolf added, \\"If Ken left Boston, he'd be losing between half a million and three quarter of a million dollars.\\"Eldridge, Larry. \\"Ken Harrelson Retires Rather Than Leave Boston,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Monday, April 21, 1969. Retrieved June 9, 2020 Following conversations with commissioner Bowie Kuhn and a contract adjustment by Cleveland, Harrelson ended his first retirement a few days later and went 2 for 4 with a triple in his first plate appearance in his Indians debut in an 11-3 loss to the New York Yankees at Cleveland Stadium on April 24.\\"Harrelson No Deterrent,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Friday, April 25, 1969. Retrieved June 9, 2020 He finished the year with 30 home runs. He also used his local celebrity status to briefly host a half-hour TV show, The Hawk's Nest, on local CBS affiliate WJW-TV. Harrelson was very popular in Cleveland, with his autobiography coming out around the time of the trade to the Indians. During spring training the following year, Harrelson suffered a broken leg while sliding into second base during a March 19 exhibition game against the Oakland Athletics. The injury kept him on the sidelines for much of the season. When Indians rookie Chris Chambliss took over the first base position in , Harrelson retired mid-season to pursue a professional golf career. =Batting glove usage= Harrelson has been credited with being the first player to wear a batting glove in an actual game (as opposed to usage during batting practice). However, Peter Morris' book A Game of Inches says the batting glove may have been used as early as 1901 by Hughie Jennings, and was definitely used by Lefty O'Doul and Johnny Frederick of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932, and later by Bobby Thomson in the 1950s. Morris does credit Harrelson with reintroducing and popularizing the batting glove in the 1960s. Roger Maris also used what was thought to be a batting glove, most likely a golf glove, in the 1961 season. Broadcasting career After his time on the links brought minimal compensation over the next few years, Harrelson turned to a broadcasting career beginning in 1975 with the Boston Red Sox on WSBK-TV partnering with Dick Stockton. He became highly popular, especially after being teamed with veteran play-by-play man Ned Martin in 1979. Harrelson left after the 1981 season, moving to a broadcasting role with the Chicago White Sox; Harrelson noted that he and Red Sox co-owner Haywood Sullivan \\"didn't get along\\". Harrelson served as a White Sox announcer from 1982 to 1985. =Executive role with White Sox= On October 2, 1985, Harrelson was named executive vice president of baseball operations for the White Sox. Then- general manager of the White Sox Roland Hemond was given a special assistant role, and left the team in April 1986, leaving Harrelson as the de facto general manager, until Tom Haller was hired as the team's new general manager in early June 1986. During June 1986, Harrelson fired assistant general manager Dave Dombrowski (who became baseball's youngest general manager with the Montreal Expos two years later) and field manager Tony La Russa (who was soon hired by the Oakland Athletics). Harrelson also traded rookie Bobby Bonilla, later a six-time All-Star, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitcher Jos√© DeLe√≥n in July 1986. Harrelson resigned his executive role with the White Sox on September 26, 1986, approximately one week before the end of the regular season. The 1986 Chicago White Sox finished the season with a record of 72‚Äì90, 20 games behind the division-winning California Angels. =Return to broadcasting= During the 1987 and 1988 seasons, Harrelson was the play-by- play announcer for New York Yankees games on SportsChannel New York. From 1984 to 1989, he served as a backup color commentator on NBC's Game of the Week broadcasts alongside play-by-play man Jay Randolph. In 1994, Harrelson served as a broadcaster for the short-lived Baseball Network and was the US broadcaster for the Japan Series that aired through the Prime-SportsChannel regional networks. Harrelson in the broadcast booth in 2007 Harrelson returned to the White Sox in 1990 as the main play-by-play announcer during television broadcasts, teaming up with Tom Paciorek until 2000 and Darrin Jackson from 2000 to 2008. In 2009, former Chicago Cubs color analyst Steve Stone began accompanying Harrelson in the television booth. During this time he won five Emmy Awards and two Illinois Sportscaster of the Year awards. However, in 2010, GQ magazine named Harrelson and broadcast partner Steve Stone the worst pair of broadcasters in baseball. Starting with the 2016 season, Harrelson cut back his schedule to road games and select home games. Jason Benetti took over as the television announcer for most home games. On May 31, 2017, Harrelson announced his final year in the broadcast booth would be the 2018 season. After calling his final game, a 6‚Äì1 loss to the crosstown rival Chicago Cubs, Harrelson officially retired from broadcasting on September 24, 2018. On December 11, 2019, Harrelson was name the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually for excellence in broadcasting by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Catch phrases, criticism and nicknames Harrelson is known for his homerism (open expression of pro-home team bias) and catch phrases, also known as \\"Hawkisms\\". Popular \\"Hawkisms\\" include: \\"You can put it on the board! Yes! Yes! A bomb for (insert player here)\\" after a Sox home run, \\"He gone!\\" and/or \\"Grab some bench!\\" after a strikeout of an opposing player, and \\"Stretch!\\" when a White Sox player hits a ball toward the outfield fence. Hawk often states \\"Sacks packed with Sox\\" when the bases are loaded. When a telecast begins, Hawk states, \\"Sit back. Relax and strap it down\\" to the viewers, right before commercial break before the first pitch. Harrelson refers to the White Sox as \\"the good guys\\" (based on the team's mid-1990s slogan Good Guys Wear Black). When a White Sox player hits a ball which appears to be heading foul, Harrelson often states \\"Stay fair!\\" Hawk will state \\"Dadgummit\\" when a ball that looks to be a home run is caught short of the wall or in general when a play does not go the White Sox's way. When a hitter hits a long foul ball that would have been a home run if it were fair, Hawk will say \\"right size, wrong shape.\\" If a White Sox hitter makes good contact, but the ball is hit where a fielder can make the out, Hawk says, \\"That's a hang with-em.\\" For a time, Hawk often stated \\"Hell yes!\\" after an advantageous event for the White Sox. While he insists that exclaiming \\"Hell yes!\\" is not contrived and is a product of his devotion to the White Sox, it has generated some controversy. He is also known for shouting out \\"Mercy!\\" after a great defensive play is executed by a player or players and sometimes, when it is an exceptionally great play, or the play does not go the White Sox's way, he will also exclaim \\"You gotta be...bleeping me!\\" When a batter swings and misses he will proclaim, \\"Big hack, no contact.\\" Harrelson refers to a routine flyball as a \\"can of corn.\\" Hawk also calls bloop hits that land between fielders, \\"duck snorts.\\" He refers to a two-hop infield ground ball as a \\"chopper-two-hopper.\\" He calls a hard-hit ground ball that takes a favorable bounce for the fielder a \\"Bolingbrook Bounce.\\" He refers to any play with a broken bat as a \\"Matt Abbatacola.\\" Matt Abbatacola is a local sports radio show host and producer for AM 670 TheScore, which carries the White Sox radio broadcasts. The two met during spring training a few years ago, and Hawk decided to use his name during broken bat plays because of the distinctiveness and sound of his name. When a White Sox rally starts, Hawk Harrelson will often enthusiastically say, \\"Don't stop now boys.\\" In July 2010, GQ named Harrelson the worst announcer in baseball. He has stated publicly that he wants to die in the booth during a game and that he will never retire. Though Harrelson has been criticized for his repeated use of catch phrases and hometown allegiances, his popularity with White Sox fans is demonstrable. Harrelson was nominated for the 2007 Ford C. Frick award (won by Royals announcer Denny Matthews), and his presence in the field of nominees for that award was due to the support of fans, who placed him in nomination (along with Cincinnati Reds announcer Joe Nuxhall and San Francisco/Oakland announcer Bill King) via an online vote. Hawk is also well known for his strong on-air criticisms of umpires. Harrelson appears to have developed a dislike of umpire Joe West, who \\"in the past few years, has had some problems with the White Sox.\\" West had started a game the night before, but called it due to rain after about a half inning of play. In a game earlier that year, West had ejected Ozzie Guill√©n and Mark Buehrle for two separate balks in the same game. Hawk said on a broadcast in 2015, \\"The first rule of baseball is catch the baseball and the second rule is don't mess with Joe West.\\" Following an on-air outburst about umpire Mark Wegner during a game on May 30, 2012, Harrelson received a reprimand from MLB commissioner Bud Selig. Harrelson's comments followed Wegner's ejection of White Sox rookie pitcher Jos√© Quintana after Quintana threw a pitch behind Ben Zobrist. After White Sox manager Robin Ventura's ejection for arguing the call, Harrelson commented: \\"I'll tell you what, they have got to start making guys be accountable. That is totally absurd. Here's an umpire in the American League that knows nothing about the game of baseball. They have got to do something about this. They have got some guys in this league that have no business umpiring. They have no business umpiring because they don't know what the game of baseball is about, and he is one of them.\\" Although Harrelson said that such a tirade would not happen again, later in the same season, he lashed out at umpire Lance Barrett following the ejections of A. J. Pierzynski and Robin Ventura. Harrelson stated that \\"Lance Barrett has just stunk the joint up is all he's done. That's all he's done.\\" He also claimed that \\"Everything that (Mariners pitcher) Blake Beavan has thrown up there that (catcher Miguel) Olivo has caught has been a strike. If he caught it, it was a strike. He's got two different strike zones. He's got a two-foot for Beavan, and he's got a 10-inch for the White Sox. What does that tell you?\\"Powers, Scott. Ken Harrelson again critical of umps. ESPNChicago.com. Retrieved August 29, 2012. A year later he had another outburst umpire tirade, this time over an alleged blown call in the bottom of the tenth against the Miami Marlins, when Angel Hernandez called Alex Rios out at first base, turning what would have been a game-winning bases-loaded ground ball fielder's choice for the White Sox into an inning- ending double play. His reaction was, \\"And another blown call by Hernandez!\\" Harrelson's emotive and particularly distinctive call of Mark Buehrle's perfect game on July 23, 2009, was also notable. As Buehrle exited the field after the eighth inning, he exclaimed, \\"Call your sons! Call your daughters! Call your friends! Call your neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game going into the ninth!\\" Also, as the final ground ball of the game rolled towards the White Sox shortstop Alexei Ram√≠rez, Harrelson called out \\"Alexei?!\\" (Harrelson often refers to the White Sox players by their first names.) As Ramirez completed the throw to the first baseman Josh Fields, Harrelson shouted \\"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! History!\\" Though some did not like Harrelson's lack of verbosity and obvious hometown boosterism at the concluding moment of the game, others felt the outburst of emotion captured exactly what they were feeling as the perfect game was sealed. A Chicago Tribune columnist, Phil Rosenthal, arguing that each perfect game call is \\"memorable in its own way\\", made an explicit comparison of Harrelson's call to Vin Scully's call of Sandy Koufax's perfect game. Harrelson had a 30-minute special on CSN Chicago, Put it on The Board which aired on Monday, June 7, 2010 celebrating his 25 years as a Chicago White Sox broadcaster with memorable footage, memorable quotes and an interview with CSN Chicago's Chuck Garfien. Ken said during the interview, \\"I hope to be broadcasting for the White Sox until I die.\\" He joked and said how he was going to die: in the White Sox broadcasting booth with his last words, \\"You can put it on the booooard... (dies without finishing)\\" Harrelson was honored with \\"Hawk Harrelson Night\\" by the Chicago White Sox for 25 years of broadcasting that was on Tuesday, June 8, 2010 vs. Detroit Tigers. The White Sox had a T-shirt giveaway for Harrelson for the first 10,000 fans that came to the game. The T-shirt has the White Sox logo on the front and in big letters on the back \\"Hawkism\\" with his famous catch phrases on the back. Harrelson also threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game to White Sox manager Ozzie Guill√©n. As a man long-known for creating nicknames, his own nickname \\"Hawk\\" originated during his early playing days. Teammates began calling him \\"Hawk\\" due to his curvy, pointy nose. Harrelson coined many nicknames for popular Sox players, including \\"Black Jack\\" McDowell, Carlos \\"El Caballo\\" Lee, Lance \\"One Dog\\" Johnson, Frank \\"The Big Hurt\\" Thomas, Craig \\"Little Hurt\\" Grebeck, \\"The Deacon\\" Warren Newson, \\"Big Bad\\" Bobby Jenks, \\"The Silent Assassin\\" Javier V√°zquez, Herbert \\"the Milkman\\" Perry, Jake \\"The Jake- Meister\\" Peavy, Day√°n \\"The Tank\\" Viciedo, Willie \\"Peapod\\" Harris, Paul \\"The Professor\\" Konerko and Magglio \\"Maggs\\" Ord√≥√±ez, along with fan favorite \\"Big Dick\\" Richard Dotson. During a broadcast, Harrelson attempted to nickname partner Darrin Jackson \\"The Squirrel\\" because of the quantity of peanuts his partner ate, to which Jackson replied, \\"No.\\" He calls his current partner Steve Stone \\"Stone Pony.\\" It is unclear if that nickname is a reference to the popular music venue or the Linda Ronstadt band, the Stone Poneys. Recently, he began calling White Sox slugger Adam Dunn \\"Biggin\\". \\"Biggin\\" is a Southern slang term for large people, which reflects Hawk's Deep South roots. Dunn is 6'6\\" and 285 pounds. More recently, Harrelson has been referring to Jos√© Abreu as El Ca√±on or \\"The Cannon.\\" Although not a nickname, during the time when Greg Norton played for the Chicago White Sox between 1996 and 2000, Harrelson would add the line \\"Norton, You're The Greatest\\" after \\"You can put it on the board! Yes! Yes!\\" when Norton hit a home run. This was a mashup of two references from the sitcom The Honeymooners: one character was named Edward \\"Ed\\" Lillywhite Norton, and another character, Ralph Kramden, would say to his wife, Alice, \\"Baby, you're the greatest.\\" An informal study by one baseball columnist, based on the number of home-team \\"biased\\" comments throughout the course of a game, concluded that Harrelson was by a wide margin the broadcaster who openly rooted for his team the most often. He embraced the results, responding, \\"That's the biggest compliment you could give me, to call me the biggest homer in baseball.\\" Personal life While he was still in high school, Harrelson met his first wife, Elizabeth Ann \\"Betty\\" Pacifici, whom he would marry that year. The marriage produced four children (Patricia, Michael, Richard, and John), and three grandchildren (Nikole, Ryan and Kiefer) and one great-grandson, Jack. Harrelson filed for divorce from Betty on June 28, 1971.\\"Harrelson Sues for Divorce.\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 29, 1971. In 1970, Harrelson was part-owner of a $2 million waterfront nightclub in East Boston called the 1800 Club. A three-quarter sized replica of Donald McKay's clipper ship Flying Cloud was docked next to the club and was used as a floating cocktail lounge. The location offered superb views of Boston Harbor and the downtown skyline. The complex was severely damaged by fire on January 20, 1971, and never re-opened.Ken Harrelson's 1800 Club at CelebrateBoston.com After retiring from baseball, Harrelson competed in the 1972 British Open. He missed the cut by 1 stroke, shooting +11.

Other members of the cast include Ahna Capri, Elayne Heilveil, and Michael C. Gwynne. The picture was filmed in and around Selma, Alabama. Plot Maury Dann (Rip Torn) is a successful country-western singer who travels around the Southern states in a Cadillac and gets himself into all sorts of adventures. The film opens with Dann performing in a small club with his band, entourage, and nagging girlfriend, Mayleen, in tow. He meets a young girl named Sandy backstage and seduces her in the back of his car while her boyfriend and boss, Mr. Bridgeway, is looking for her. The band returns to a nearby motel, bringing along Rosamond, a young lady from the show. The next day, Maury visits his invalid mother and, along with a couple of the guys from the band, goes on a hunting trip. He gets into a fistfight with Bob Tally over Maury's dog Snapper, who is not being properly taken care of by Maury's sick mother. After the fight, Maury reluctantly gives Snapper away to Bob, but fires him from the band before returning to the motel. During the trip, Maury seduces Rosamond in the back of the Cadillac, much to Mayleen's dismay. Later, while in the ladies' room, Mayleen warns Rosamond to stay away from Maury. The band stops by a local radio station to help promote Maury's new album, Payday, and to bribe a DJ with a gift of Wild Turkey liquor to keep playing more of Maury's records on-air. During a heated exchange, Maury kicks Mayleen out of the car and leaves her stranded by the side of the road. Maury take a detour and goes to visit his ex-wife, Galen, to celebrate his son's birthday. They get into an argument as well and Maury leaves without seeing his son. At a restaurant, Maury and company are confronted by a drunken Bridgeway, who claims that Maury had raped Sandy the day before. Maury and Bridgeway step outside to discuss the matter. Bridgeway pulls out a knife and tries to attack Maury, who quickly turns the knife around and stabs Bridgeway to death. To avoid a scandal and missing tour dates, Maury's tour manager McGinty arranges for his chauffeur, Chicago, to take the blame for Bridgeway's death. With Chicago gone, Maury hires a young fan named Ted, an aspiring country singer, to be his new driver. Rosamond, feeling distraught over Bridgeway's death, tells Ted that she wants to go home but doesn't have any money to go back. The local police and district attorney come to Maury's motel to bring him in for questioning over Bridgeway's death. He makes a dash for the Cadillac. With Ted in the back seat and Maury driving the car, Maury suffers a heart attack and dies behind the wheel. The film ends with Ted, who survives the crash but is badly injured, running out of a wooded area looking for help.

The episode is the second part of The Meteor Shower Trilogy, and centers upon third grader Stan Marsh and his father Randy. It premiered on Comedy Central on July 21, 1999. The episode was written by series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and David Goodman. It is noted for being the first episode in which Butters Stotch serves as an important supporting character, with substantial dialogue.Abraham, Chris. \\"Ranking Every Butters Episode of South Park Best to Worst\\". Ranker. Retrieved June 21, 2018. Plot After dropping Shelly off at Cartman's home, the Marshes and Stan are off to a party at the home of Mr. Mackey. Stan is upset that he has to go and becomes even more angered when he is locked in a room with nerdy \\"Melvin\\" classmates that he does not like: Pip, Butters, and Dougie. After finding a box of women's clothing the three insist on playing Charlie's Angels, and an unenthusiastic Stan uses the game to find a way out of the basement to an upstairs bedroom where there are cookies and TV. Meanwhile, at the party, Mr. Mackey gives the Broflovskis and Marshes a tour of his home and leads them out to the hot tub. The wives leave Randy and Gerald outside in the hot tub, who declare the present evening to be a night of experimenting. The two talk about threesomes and decide to masturbate in front of one another. This leads to awkwardness after Randy questions his sexuality. The ATF thinks that the party inside is a suicide cult, and that they plan to kill themselves at the start of the meteor shower. Determined to prevent this, they set up a blockade and prepare to open fire on the cult if they do not desist; at one point, a couple of party-goers leave and are immediately fatally shot at (due to the ATF believing they had weapons despite them clearly not having any). The Newsman recalls that the last time the ATF did this was at the Waco siege where they ended up killing innocent people for false accusation, but the ATF dismisses him. All the while, the party-goers (who progressively become drunk) inside are unaware of their presence. Stan and the kids discover what is happening and try to speak to the ATF, but are shot at and forced to flee back inside. The kids record a video tape showing that the party inside is not a cult to the Newsman; the ATF realizes their mistake, claiming it was a \\"test simulation\\" and quickly disperse after their secret weapon, a large rocket called \\"The Negotiator\\", fires and destroys every home in the neighborhood except for Mackey's. Inside, Randy is extremely uncomfortable being around Gerald, who is concerned about Randy's behavior. When Randy finally admits to the entire party that he and Gerald engaged in group masturbation, he is relieved upon discovering that he's not the only one to have masturbated in front of a person of the same sex. Outside, the boys rejoice their triumph of saving the day and Stan realizes that the others are just normal kids like him. All is immediately forgotten, however, when Kyle returns from Jewbilee camp and Stan goes back to his old ways, telling Kyle that he had to \\"spend the evening with these friggin' Melvins\\". The credits roll with a parody version of Cher's \\"Believe\\" (which the ATF used to drown out the party-goers in an effort for them to submit, unaware that Mackey was playing the same song and which everyone enjoyed). Production Trey and Matt based much of the plot, including the ATF's use of Cher, on the Waco siege after watching the documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagement. Pam Brady provided the voice for Cher.

He went on to be an active member of the Rhinoceros Party of which he was an official agent from 1985 to 1987. He joined the Marijuana Party shortly after its foundation and became the leader of the Marijuana Party in 2004, following the resignation of Marc-Boris St- Maurice. He has been a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada on three occasions, each time with a different party label. He ran for the Green Party in the 1984 election in the riding of Burnaby placing a distant fourth of four candidates with 364 of 58,991 votes. In 1988 he ran against opposition leader John Turner, with no party affiliation, and placed ninth of twelve candidates with 52 of 54,654 votes. Longley ran for the Bloc pot in the 2003 Quebec provincial election. He later ran for the Marijuana Party in the riding of North Okanagan‚ÄîShuswap in 2004 and placed fifth of eight candidates with 492 of 51,765 votes, then in 2008 in the riding of Hochelaga, Quebec, placing eighth of nine with 183 of 45,683 votes. Following the legalization of cannabis in Canada, Longley said it was \\"going to be harder than ever now for the [Marijuana] party to exist\\". Only four candidates ran for the Marijuana Party in the 2019 federal election. Longley is currently the Marijuana Party's chief agent, in addition to being the Party's leader, and so is ineligible to run in federal elections.

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. () is a Dutch-domiciled multinational chemical company with American and British roots, incorporated in the Netherlands, with U.S. operations headquarters in Houston, Texas, and offices in London, UK. The company is the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. It also produces ethylene, propylene, polyolefins, and oxyfuels. LyondellBasell was formed in December 2007 by the acquisition of Lyondell Chemical Company by Basell Polyolefins for $12.7 billion. As of 2016, Lyondell was the third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the United States. History =Early history= Since its establishment in 1985 from facilities belonging to the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), the company grew through stock swaps with Occidental Chemicals and Millennium Chemicals in 1997 which formed Equistar Chemicals of which each entity were partners. Lyondell purchased the outstanding shares from each of its partners to gain total control of Equistar which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lyondell. In 2004, Lyondell purchased Millennium Chemicals in a stock-swap deal at $2.3 billion. In August 2006, Lyondell acquired Citgo's interest in the Lyondell- Citgo Refinery for $2.1 billion, and renamed the facility Houston Refining. Chemical maker Basell Polyolefins purchased Lyondell in December 2007, creating the new company LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A., one of the largest chemical companies in the world at that time. It was owned by Access Industries, a privately held, U.S.-based industrial group. LyondellBasell is the third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the world and is headquartered in Houston and Rotterdam . =Expansion= Facility in Houston LyondellBasell's United States operations filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010. The company was only under bankruptcy protection for 15 months. Its former parent company, LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. was replaced by LyondellBasell Industries N.V. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on October 14, 2010. In 2012, 1 Houston Center, the building housing LyondellBasell's Houston headquarters since 1986, was renamed LyondellBasell Tower. In 2014, LyondellBasell announced that it was installing two large cracking furnaces at its Channelview plant, and the following year the company announced it would double production capacity at the Bayport Underwood plant. LyondellBasell acquired the compounding assets of Zylog Plastalloys, an India-based company, in November 2015. The acquisition made LyondellBasell the third largest PP compounds producer in India. In June 2016, LyondellBasell announced a factory in Northern China. It was the third facility for LyondellBasell to open in China, following Guangzhou and Suzhou. In September 2016, LyondellBasell announced that it would build a $700 million polyethylene plant at the La Porte manufacturing complex on the Houston Ship Channel that would produce 1.1 billion pounds of polyethylene annually. The company started construction on a La Porte plant in May 2017. The company completed an expansion of its Corpus Christi ethylene plant in January 2017. The plant's capacity was increased by 50 percent to produce 2.5 billion pounds annually. That same year, Hurricane Harvey hit the United States and affected the company's Texas Gulf Coast operations. The Houston Ship Channel was temporarily closed, which prevented crude tankers from reaching refineries. The La Porte facility was damaged but came back online in late October. In December 2017, LyondellBasell partnered with Suez, a French water and waste management company, in the first joint venture between a major plastics and chemicals company and a resource management company. LyondellBasell and Odebrecht entered into exclusive talks for LyondellBasell to acquire control of Braskem in June 2018. During July 2018, LyondellBasell announced a partnership with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany to advance chemical recycling of plastic materials and assist the global efforts towards the circular economy and plastic waste recycling needs. The focus of the venture is to develop a new catalyst and process technology to decompose post-consumer plastic waste, such as packaging, into monomers for reuse in polymerization processes. In August 2018, LyondellBasell finalized their acquisition of A. Schulman Inc. in a $2.25 billion deal. That same month, it broke ground on the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant in Channelview, Texas. The plant is estimated to produce 1 billion pounds of propylene oxide and 2.2 billion pounds of tertiary butyl alcohol annually. LyondellBasell will export the majority of its products via the Houston Ship Channel. LyondellBasell also announced in September that it and its joint partner, Covestro, kicked-off a large investment project in Maasvlakte-Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Circular Steam Project incorporates an innovative technology into the existing production plant, to convert its water-based waste into energy and is an important contribution to the Dutch government's CO2 reduction targets. Philanthropy LyondellBasell holds an annual Global Care Day, where company employees volunteer for community service projects in 20 countries. LyondellBasell raised $2.7 million for United Way in 2015. In 2016, LyondellBasell raised $2.65 million across its 23 company sites for Victoria County United Way in Texas. At the time, it was the largest donation the organization had received. The following year, the company donated $54,424 to Victoria County United Way to support 18 partner agencies in the surrounding area. In April 2017, LyondellBasell's Corpus Christi complex raised over $78,000 for United Way of the Coastal Bend which would benefit the Greenwood Molina Childcare Center.

In 1831, Naper and his brother John were credited with founding Naper's Settlement, the oldest Illinois community to be established west of Fort Dearborn, now Chicago. Naper's Settlement would be renamed Naperville, becoming the oldest town and first county seat of DuPage County, Illinois, later moved by county vote in 1868 and displaced by Wheaton. Early life Joseph Naper was born in Bennington, Vermont and traveled west with his parents during his youth to Ashtabula, Ohio, where he learned to be a ship builder from his father. In 1809, Joseph Naper's sister Amy Naper married John Murray of Ashtabula, Ohio, who would later become one of the founding settlers of Naperville, Illinois. The Naper family ships traded goods on the Great Lakes, frequently stopping at Fort Dearborn on Lake Michigan. On an early trip, Naper acquired lots near the fort, as did many of the first settlers to reach the Chicago River port. Town builder and politician On a later trip in 1831, on the Telegraph, a ship built by Joseph Naper, he was joined by his brother John Naper. The Naper families and five other families settled in the area, first known as Naper's Settlement, which later would become a part of DuPage County. Joseph Naper platted the town of Naperville, surveying the property and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives for the first time in 1836. Here, Naper laid the groundwork and supervised passage of the 1839 bill which separated DuPage County from Cook County. Joseph Naper also served on the same committee with Abraham Lincoln, then a newly elected legislator from the Springfield area. Military service Joseph Naper served as an Illinois Militia captain in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and was one of the many DuPage County men who served in the Mexican War of 1846. Businessman and village president In the 1850s, Joseph Naper was one of the founding stockholders for the short-lived \\"Southwest Plank Road\\", now Ogden Avenue/U.S. Route 34, which improved transportation between Aurora, Illinois and Chicago. Another major plank road stockholder was Colonel Julius M. Warren of nearby Warrenville. Joseph Naper returned to the Illinois General Assembly in 1852. His aggressive actions again provided a means for establishing new communities within the state of Illinois. In 1857, Naper became the first village president of Naperville. As many early settlers had done, Naper engaged in a number of trades and businesses as he helped to develop Naperville and Dupage County. Death On August 23, 1862, Joseph Naper died in Naperville, Illinois and was buried in Naperville Cemetery. References *Richmond, C.W. and H. F. Valletta. A history of the county of DuPage, Illinois.

Its southern terminus is at a full cloverleaf interchange with the Bay and Ocean parkways in Jones Beach State Park. The parkway heads north, crossing South Oyster Bay and intersecting Loop Parkway before crossing onto the mainland and connecting to the Southern State Parkway in North Merrick. It continues north to the village of Carle Place, where the Meadowbrook Parkway ends at exit 31A of the Northern State Parkway. The Meadowbrook Parkway is designated New York State Route 908E (NY 908E), an unsigned reference route. Most of the road is limited to non-commercial traffic, like most parkways in the state of New York; however, the portion south of Merrick Road is open to commercial traffic. The Meadowbrook State Parkway was first envisioned in 1924 as part of the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC) and Robert Moses's system to connect several parks in Nassau and Suffolk counties. One park included in the proposal was Jones Beach State Park, which opened along with the Ocean Parkway in 1929. Construction of the Meadowbrook and Loop causeways began in July 1933, and was slated for completion in January 1935. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned $5,050,000 toward the project, which was completed in October 1934. Nassau County acquired the right-of-way for an extension to the Northern State Parkway in 1936, and the highway was originally intended to be finished for the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The start of construction was ultimately delayed until December 1953, and the $10 million (1953 USD) highway was completed in October 1956. Reconstruction projects in the later parts of the 20th century have caused local protests by entities such as the town of Hempstead and the village of Westbury. The latter was concerned about construction affecting the way of life in Westbury, and the mayor and citizens wanted confirmation that the reconstruction of Northern State Parkway exit 31‚Äîthe Meadowbrook State Parkway's northern terminus‚Äîwould not lead to environmental disruption. In August 1998, the Meadowbrook was dedicated as the Senator Norman J. Levy Memorial Parkway in honor of Norman J. Levy, a state senator who helped sponsor the first seat belt law in the United States. Route description The Meadowbrook at the toll barrier to Jones Beach Island The Meadowbrook State Parkway begins at a cloverleaf interchange with the Ocean Parkway and Bay Parkway on Jones Beach Island in the town of Hempstead. The parkway briefly proceeds northwest through Jones Beach before turning northward and crossing South Oyster Bay on a six-lane causeway. After crossing the bay, the Meadowbrook reaches exit M10, a trumpet interchange with Loop Parkway. After Loop Parkway, the Meadowbrook heads northwest across another water channel and becomes a divided highway with a large center median. A third bridge over a waterway soon follows, bringing the Meadowbrook Parkway onto the mainland part of Long Island near the Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve. As the highway heads north from the channels surrounding the west end of South Oyster Bay, it runs along the west side of the Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve and the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which are separated from the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exit M9, a cloverleaf interchange with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route 27 or CR 27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to the north is exit M8, another cloverleaf serving NY 27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exit M7, a cloverleaf interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (unsigned CR 7A). After exit M7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park. Signage on the Meadowbrook as seen from exit M8 in Freeport At the northern edge of the park, the Meadowbrook enters exit M6, a partial cloverleaf interchange with several flyover ramps connecting to the Southern State Parkway. After the Southern State interchange, the Meadowbrook continues north through a narrow park known as Barnum Woods, which separates the heavily developed neighborhoods of Uniondale to the west and East Meadow to the east. The highway passes over NY 102 (Front Street) with no connection before leaving Barnum Woods and bending northward near exit M5 and the northbound half of exit M4, which serve NY 24 (Hempstead Turnpike) and several other local streets by way of a series of service roads in the vicinity of Eisenhower Park, Nassau Coliseum, and Mitchel Field. After another mile (1.6 km), the Meadowbrook makes a turn to the west and enters exit M4 southbound and exit M3, which connect to Stewart Avenue (unsigned CR 177) via Merchants Concourse. Exit M3 also serves Nassau Community College, located just southwest of the Meadowbrook Parkway. Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State Parkway enters exit M2, a cloverleaf interchange with Zeckendorf Boulevard (unsigned CR 260) adjacent to nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exit M2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound direction of the parkway has only one exit, exit M2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exit M1, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR 25) on the border between the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place. Just north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit 31A of the Northern State Parkway, a semi-directional T interchange that serves as the north end of the Meadowbrook State Parkway. According to annual average daily traffic counts compiled by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the parkway is the section north of the Southern State Parkway. This portion carries an average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old Country Road serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the Southern State Parkway, the Meadowbrook Parkway sees only an average of about 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest part in this stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the Southern State Parkway, which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook Parkway, as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months. History = Design and construction = The Meadowbrook State Parkway was part of the original design for the Long Island Parkway System, developed by Robert Moses and LISPC in 1924 to alleviate congestion on \\"unattractive\\" local roads. The system was designed to connect several parks that were under construction at the time, including Jones Beach State Park, Bethpage State Park and Sunken Meadow State Park. In 1927, the parkway system was linked to parkways in New York City's boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Jones Beach State Park and the Ocean Parkway opened in 1929, with access to the mainland via the Jones Beach Causeway (now part of the Wantagh State Parkway). The parkway was named after Meadow Brook, the stream that follows its route between East Meadow and Freeport. The beach at Jones Beach State Park, for which the Meadowbrook was constructed to serve drivers from New York City Construction of the Meadowbrook Causeway began in May 1933 with a $5,050,000 loan (1933 USD) given from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Long Island State Park Commission in April 1933. In order to repay this loan, the Long Island State Park Commission, working with the Jones Beach State Parkway Authority, would institute a 25-cent toll on the Meadowbrook and Jones Beach causeways. The 50-cent parking fee on Jones Beach would be reduced to 25 cents in order to keep the total charged to motorists at 50 cents. It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years. The Meadowbrook Causeway was designed as a road from the Southern State Parkway in Freeport to Jones Beach with six bridges across channels of South Oyster Bay. Three grade-separating structures would be designed as well by the State of New York Department of Public Works and the LISPC. A trumpet interchange with the Lido Beach Loop Causeway (current-day Loop Parkway) was constructed as well. Designs also included 10.1 million cubic yards of hydraulic fill, and a new water channel for boats. Proposed completion of the project was set for January 1, 1935. The road was constructed by 3,800 people and completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule. On October 27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways were opened to vehicular traffic by LISPC. A motorcade of cars was led across the new roadways by Robert Moses, then a Republican Party candidate for Governor of New York. The event was preceded by parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money and letting the LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised Moses and the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, two-way traffic was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the Southern State and Merrick Road until June 1, 1935. Prior to that time, motorists had to use the renamed Wantagh Causeway to access Jones Beach. = Extension to the Northern State Parkway = The Meadowbrook at the Southern State Parkway (exit M6W) in Barnum Woods Moses announced during the opening of the Bethpage State Parkway in November 1936 that the land for extending the Meadowbrook from the Southern State Parkway to the Northern State Parkway had been acquired by Nassau County and plans for the road were being designed by the State Division of Highways. Moses stated that the funds would be requested at the next session of the New York State Legislature, with a completion date of 1939 to coincide with the opening of the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens. This would make it plausible for motorists to go from Flushing to Jones Beach State Park directly. The new extension would also alleviate congestion along several north‚Äìsouth highways in Nassau County and provide quicker access to Jones Beach. However, construction on the $10 million (1956 USD) highway was delayed until December 1953. On October 13, 1956, Governor Averell Harriman officially opened the new extension of the Meadowbrook State Parkway with a ribbon- cutting ceremony at 11:30 a.m. near the Jerusalem Avenue overpass. Robert Moses, Hempstead Town Supervisor Edward Larkin, and Nassau County Executive Holly Patterson also attended the event. After the ceremony, a motorcade led by Moses traveled from the Northern State Parkway south to Roosevelt Field Shopping Center. At Roosevelt Field, the board chairman for Roosevelt Field, Inc., William Zeckendorf, honored Moses and Harriman with brand new tankards made of sterling silver. On July 5, 1962, the New York State Assembly announced the opening of bids on the widening of a section of the Meadowbrook between Merrick Road and the Southern State Parkway. Bids were to be accepted on the project in August, with a price tag of $3.851 million (1962 USD). The construction would widen the segment from four lanes to six and add a new center median. The widening was prompted by the frequency of accidents along the stretch, and efforts to develop the project were sped up as a result. Completion was set for 1964, and the reconstruction and repaving was finished on November 18, 1964. = Reconstruction concerns = The interchange constructed between the Meadowbrook and Northern state parkways in 1956 was undergoing a new $61 million (1989 USD) reconstruction project in the late 1980s. Although it was previously redesigned in 1968, it was still the site of about 180 accidents per year‚Äîover six times the statewide average for accident frequency. The junction was to be rebuilt with three lanes in each direction for the Northern State in the middle of exit 31A, a direct ramp between the westbound Northern State Parkway and the southbound Meadowbrook, connections from Glen Cove Road to both parkways, and the relocation of exit and entrance ramps within the interchange. Construction began in May 1988, and the project was expected to be completed on October 31, 1991. It was proceeding on schedule until the village of Westbury filed a suit against NYSDOT in February 1989\\\\. The lawsuit claimed that NYSDOT did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing the project because their environmental impact report failed to consider the impacts of a nearby future widening project on the Northern State Parkway. This widening project, considered a second phase of the interchange reconstruction, had no intended date of construction. The Meadowbrook northbound approaching the interchange with the Northern State Parkway, scene of a lawsuit in 1989 The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that NYSDOT had to provide a new environmental report by May 12, 1989 or face having the reconstruction shut down. The order by the court reversed a decision by the New York State Supreme Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April 24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. On December 19, 1989, the Court of Appeals announced their decision on the case of Village of Westbury v. Department of Transportation of the State of New York, et al., ruling in favor of Westbury. In its decision, the court stated NYSDOT should have issued a joint report for the interchange and widening projects because both projects improved the flow of traffic on the Northern State Parkway and thus were related. The ruling made by the previous court was affirmed, and NYSDOT was advised to consider the environmental impacts of projects on other nearby projects in the future. While the village of Westbury was praising Ernest Strada for taking on the state, residents of the village of Carle Place felt they were being taken hostage by his actions and that the stoppage of work was hurting their community more than Westbury. Editorials in Newsday also called the mayor \\"parochial and overzealous\\". While Carle Place was complaining about the inability to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried about the safety of the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also went out of their way to call this a simple \\"not in my backyard\\" case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would have to continue the original \\"violation\\" of not giving a report. Westbury and NYSDOT came to a deal allowing construction to resume in February 1990, with lane changes and other modifications being made by the end of the month. This truce, made by Governor Cuomo, allowed work to resume at a normal pace, with nearly 200 workers doing daily work on the project by April 1990. The speed of progress on the reconstruction put the project back on track to meet the original October 1991 deadline. Mayor Strada, however, stated that he thought NYSDOT would not advance any work that would \\"need to be ripped up\\". The interchange reconstruction project was ultimately completed in 1991 as expected. = Recent changes = In 1947, the LISPC approved $37,000 (1947 USD) to construct a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who took control of the parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges. Signage denoting the State Senator Norman J. Levy Memorial Parkway designation just south of exit M7E on the northbound Meadowbrook In August 1998, signs were installed along the Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating the road in honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also been part of the negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook‚ÄìNorthern State interchange. The new signs were unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road. Dignitaries at the honoring ceremony included then-Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Fuschillo and Levy's widow, Joy Levy. Signs were erected at both ends of the Meadowbrook Parkway and at a point near the Babylon Turnpike interchange. The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a study of how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by engineers from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway. In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg demonstrated with ten civic leaders in front of the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY 102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY 24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a project that began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign due to the fact that the bridge had more damage than initially realized.

Made possible by inventions such as the spinning jenny, spinning mule, and water frame around the time of the American Revolution, the textile industry was among the earliest mechanized industries, and models of production and labor sources were first explored here. The system used domestic labor, often referred to as mill girls, who came to the new textile centers from rural towns to earn more money than they could at home, and to live a cultured life in \\"the city\\". Their life was very regimented - they lived in the company boardinghouses and were held to strict hours and a moral code. As competition grew in the domestic textile industry and wages declined, strikes began to occur, and with the introduction of cheaper imported foreign workers by mid- century, the system proved unprofitable and collapsed. Precursor Slater Mill The precursor to the Waltham-Lowell system was seen in Rhode Island, where British immigrant Samuel Slater set up his first spinning mills in the 1790s. Slater drew on his British village experience to create a factory system called the \\"Rhode Island System,\\" based on the customary patterns of family life in New England villages. Children aged 7 to 12 were the first employees of the mill; Slater personally supervised them closely. The first child workers were hired in 1790. It is highly unlikely that Slater resorted to physical punishment, relying on a system of fines. Slater first tried to staff his mill with women and children from afar, but that fell through due to the close-knit framework of the New England family. He then brought in whole families, creating entire towns.No. 384: Samuel Slater He provided company- owned housing nearby, along with company stores; he sponsored a Sunday School where college students taught the children reading and writing. Characteristics The Waltham-Lowell system pioneered the use of a vertically integrated system.Dublin 1989, p. 160 Here there was complete control over all aspects of production. Spinning, weaving, dyeing, and cutting were now completed in a single plant.Walton 2010, p. 168 This large amount of control made it so that no other company could interfere with production. The Waltham mill also pioneered the process of mass production. This greatly increased the scale of manufacturing. Water-powered line shafts and belts now connected hundreds of power lines. The increase in manufacturing occurred so rapidly that there was no localized labor supply in the early 19th century that could have sufficed.Vance 1966, p. 316 Lowell solved this problem by hiring young women. =Waltham= After the successes of Samuel Slater, a group of investors now called The Boston Associates and led by Newburyport, Massachusetts merchant Francis Cabot Lowell devised a new textile operation on the Charles River in Waltham, Massachusetts, west of Boston. This new firm, the first in the nation to place cotton-to-cloth production under one roof, was incorporated as the Boston Manufacturing Company in 1814. The Boston Associates tried to create a controlled system of labor, unlike the harsh conditions they observed while in Lancashire, England. The owners recruited young New England farm girls from the surrounding area to work the machines at Waltham. The mill girls lived in company boarding houses and were subject to strict codes of conduct and supervised by older women. They worked about 80 hours per week. Six days per week, they woke to the factory bell at 4:40 am and reported to work at 5 am before a half-hour breakfast break at 7 am. They worked until a lunch break of 30 to 45 minutes around noon. The workers then returned to their company houses at 7 pm when the factory closed. This system became known as the Waltham System. =Lowell= Tintype of two young women in Lowell, Massachusetts (circa 1871) While the Boston Manufacturing Company proved immensely profitable, the Charles River had very little potential as a power source. Francis Cabot Lowell died prematurely in 1817, and soon his partners traveled north of Boston to East Chelmsford, Massachusetts, where the large Merrimack River could provide far more power. The first mills, the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, were running by 1823. The settlement was incorporated as the town of Lowell in 1826, and became the city of Lowell ten years later. Boasting ten textile corporations, all running on the Waltham System and each considerably larger than the Boston Manufacturing Company, Lowell became one of the largest cities in New England and the model, now known as the Lowell System, was copied elsewhere in New England, often in other mill towns developed by the Boston Associates. Examples include Manchester, New Hampshire; Lewiston, Maine; Lawrence, Massachusetts; and Holyoke, Massachusetts. Decline One of the last remaining textile mill boarding houses in Lowell, Massachusetts on right, part of the Lowell National Historical Park Eventually, cheaper and less organized foreign labor replaced the mill girls. Even by the time of the founding of Lawrence in 1845, there were questions being raised about its viability.http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/mhr/2/ford.html Peter A. Ford - \\"Father of the whole enterprise\\" Charles S. Storrow and the Making of Lawrence, Massachusetts, 1845‚Äì1860 One of the leading causes of this transition to foreign labor and the demise of the system was the coming of the Civil War. Girls went to be nurses, back to their farms, or into positions that men had left when they went to the army.MacDonald 1937, p. 61 These girls were out of the mills for the duration of the war and when the mills reopened after the war, the girls were gone because they no longer needed the mills. They had rooted into their new occupations or moved on in life to the point where the mill was no longer suitable for them. The lack of mill girls created a movement towards Irish immigrants. The Irish community that was building in Lowell, Massachusetts was not exclusively female unlike the grouping of mill girls in the dormitories.Dublin 1975, p. 34 The proportion of male employment at the mill increased which rapidly changed the demographics of the people that work there. The Lowell plant became heavily dependent on the foreign lower-class, especially the Irish immigrants that flocked to Massachusetts. This reliance on foreign workers forced the mills to become what they had been trying to avoid with the mill girls. Poverty snuck up on them and they were forced to deal with slums and a poor lower-class. These immigrants tended to have families and they did not live in the dormitory-style of the mill girls. While in many cases the boardinghouses outlived the system, families of immigrant workers typically lived in tenement neighborhoods, and off company property.

The film includes three features: Donald Duck: Stuck on Christmas (featuring Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Scrooge McDuck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie), A Very Goofy Christmas (featuring Goofy, Max, Pete and the Beagle Boys) and Mickey and Minnie's Gift of the Magi (featuring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and Pluto). Other Disney characters also make cameos in the film. A sequel, titled Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, was released in 2004. Stories =Donald Duck: Stuck On Christmas= Inspired by the 1892 short story \\"Christmas Every Day\\" by William Dean Howells. Huey, Dewey and Louie wake up one Christmas morning and open their presents, even though they are supposed to wait first for Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie to arrive. After the boys take their new sleds from their Uncle Donald (not reading the included card) they go sledding and have Christmas dinner in which Donald yells at them to learn their manners. While Donald, Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie sing carols, the boys play with their new toys. Later, it is time for the boys to go to bed and having enjoyed the day immensely, the boys then wish for it to be Christmas every day. Their wish is granted and at first, the three are joyful. After a few days, however, they begin to get tired of Christmas and soon realize that every day will be exactly the same as the day when they first made their wish. They then decide to change the course of action of the next day by playing tricks and pranks, including swapping the cooked turkey with a live one for the dinner table. It turns out to be a terrible Christmas for everyone, especially Donald. Shortly after, the boys read the card that was given to them earlier by Donald and Daisy. The card wishes them love and explains that Christmas is not just about presents, it is also about being with family. The boys feel guilty and decide to make amends by making the next day the best Christmas ever. At the end of the next day, the boys finally realize the true meaning of Christmas and the time loop ends, leading into the day after Christmas. =A Very Goofy Christmas= Goofy and Max are mailing out a letter to Santa Claus. However, as soon as they get home, Pete, the neighbor, tells Max that Santa does not exist, predicting that he cannot fly around the world in one night. Things get worse when Goofy poses as Santa for some kids and Max finds out that he tricked him. Goofy is determined to prove to Max that Santa does exist and even stays up all Christmas Eve to keep an eye out for him while Max, still bitter over Goofy's trickery, wishes for him to move on. But after a long time, and after mistaking a Beagle Boy (who was robbing Pete's house) for Santa and falling off the roof, Goofy gives up hope of Santa coming. Now, Max does everything that Goofy did to make his father happy, including posing as Santa. In the end, the real Santa actually comes and gives Max the gift he had asked for earlier (as well as blowing some snow on Pete's house when the cunning neighbor tries to flatter the legendary figure). When Max asks if Santa forgot Goofy's present, Goofy answers that, every year, he asks for the same thing and, every year, he always gets it: Max's happiness. This segment of Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas chronologically precedes the cartoon series, Goof Troop. Max is voiced by Shaun Fleming. =Mickey and Minnie's Gift of the Magi= Based on the 1905 short story \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" by O. Henry. Mickey wants to get Minnie a gold chain for her one heirloom, her watch, so he works at Crazy Pete's Tree Lot. Minnie wants to give Mickey something special for Christmas as well, so she works hard at her job in a department store to get a special bonus. When Mickey gives a short tree to a poor family who are unable to buy a Pete-10-Footer tree, his uptight and greedy boss Pete steals all of Mickey's money and dismisses him from the store. Then, Pete accidentally puts his still-lit cigar into his pocket with Mickey's money without noticing, which eventually sets himself, the money and his trees on fire, destroying his chance to sell his expensive 10-footers. Meanwhile, Minnie's bonus from her stingy boss Mortimer Mouse proves to be nothing but a fruit cake. After playing music for a toy drive with the Firehouse Five, Mickey has the idea that he can trade his harmonica for the chain. The shop closes by the time he gets there and the owner rejects it, thinking it is not worth anything, but changes his mind after hearing its music. Back at Minnie's house, Mickey gives her the chain for her watch and Minnie gives him a case for his harmonica. Of course, the irony is that Minnie no longer has her watch‚Äîjust as Mickey no longer has his harmonica‚Äîso the gifts are essentially useless. As in The Gift of the Magi upon which this adaptation‚Äîpenned by O. Henry‚Äîis based, the thought behind each gift is what counts. The film concludes with a medley of various songs, \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Deck the Halls\\" and \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\", featuring the main characters from the three segments.

Despite the blending and incorporation of pre-Columbian and Spanish-influenced cuisine, traditional cuisine differs on the Pacific coast from the Caribbean coast. While the Pacific coast's main staple revolves around beef, poultry, local fruits, and corn, the Caribbean coast's cuisine makes use of seafood and coconut. Cuisine =Main staples= Corn is a staple food in Nicaragua As in many other Latin American countries, corn is a staple. It is used in many of the widely consumed dishes, such as nacatamal, and indio viejo. Corn is not only used in food; it is also an ingredient for drinks such as pinolillo and chicha as well as in sweets and desserts. Other staples are rice and beans. Rice is eaten when corn is not, and beans are consumed as a cheap protein by the majority of Nicaraguans. It is common for rice and beans to be eaten as a breakfast dish. There are many meals including these two staples; one popular dish, gallo pinto, is often served as lunch, sometimes with eggs. Nicaraguans do not limit their diet solely to corn, rice, and beans. Many Nicaraguans have small gardens of their own full of vegetables. From time to time, flowers are incorporated into their meals. Commonly used ingredients (including fruits and vegetables) are peanuts, cabbage (shredded in vinegar, this is called \\"ensalada\\" and used as a side dish. Sometimes carrots and beets are added.) carrots, beets, butternut squash, plantains, bananas, fresh ginger, onion, potato, peppers, jocote, grosella, mimbro, mango, papaya, tamarind, pipian, apples, avocado, yuca, and quequisque. Herbs such as culantro, oregano, and achiote are also used in cooking. Typical Nicaraguan dishes Gallo pinto Arroz a la valenciana =Refrescos (drinks)= Chicha morada served with pipe√±o Nicaraguan cuisine makes use of fruits, some of which are only grown in that particular region due to their location. Many fruits are made into drinks, such as melon, papaya, guayaba, guan√°bana, coconut, pineapple, and pitahaya.

He was initially inspired by the writings of Carlos Castaneda and by his own studies among the Wirrarika, said to be cultural descendants of the Pre-Columbian Native American Toltecs. Sanchez's first book, The Teachings of Don Carlos: Practical Applications of the Works of Carlos Castaneda (1995), provides in-depth techniques and commentary on a path of \\"self-growth\\" based on the wisdom of the Toltec descendants. His approach in this book is bringing the proposals of Castaneda down to the earth focusing on those parts of Castaneda's book that can be applied in everyday life and used for personal development, while discouraging the use of psychotropic plants, which was prominent in mostly in the first book of Castaneda \\"The Teachings of Don Juan\\" . Sanchez has published four further books: Toltecs of the New Millennium (1996), providing an overview of and background on the author's experiences with the Wirrarika; The Toltec Path of Recapitulation: Healing Your Past to Free Your Soul (2001); and The Toltec Oracle (2004); and \\"Los Colores de Tu Alma\\" (The Colors of Your Soul - not yet translated into English) (2014). Sanchez's recapitulation technique bears some resemblance to Sandra Ingerman's soul retrieval technique, but is probably the most comprehensive approach to the subject that has been published so far. Other shamanic teachers using similar techniques include Michael Harner, PhD founder of core shamanism, and Ken Page, founder of Heart and Soul Healing. Some have associated Sanchez's work with Toltec author Don Miguel √Ångel Ruiz, author of the Four Agreements. S√°nchez usually respond to such association, that while he likes the general message of Ruiz¬¥ book, they are not particular of the Toltec but could be found in many religions or world philosophies. Even though Sanchez¬¥ work prominently deals with the topic of shamanism, he does not accept to be described as a shaman, but rather as a researcher in the field of indigenous knowledge, shamanism and personal development. He states that \\"shamanism is way too important to leave it in the hands of shamans\\". His approach is that the core shamanic experience is about a shift in human consciousness that is meant to be performed by any human being and the emphasis in shamans with special powers to be admired or followed can be a distraction of the real task of \\"re-integrating the other side of our consciousness\\". For him the cult to celebrities or gurus diverts people¬¥s attention away from the key elements of real personal development which depends of each individual¬¥s action. Due to Sanchez¬¥emphasis on the importance of actual research, study and real life experiences; he feels skeptical about the fact that much of what is said and written about the Toltec in spiritual oriented books, come more from literary imagination, rather than actual research with the living Toltec descendants indigenous communities of Mexico or from the study of the ancient Mexican codices. In his works Sanchez coins the term \\"anti-anthropology\\", likening his form of research to anti-psychiatry. His approach to the study of the natives he portrays is, in his own words, \\"not to transform them, but to transform\\" himself by looking at the indigenous ways of soul development, in contrast to the anthropology academic approach which focuses more on the material elements of the culture, political organization, economy, etc., while leaving aside fundamental matters such as the perspective and experience of indigenous cultures regarding the development of human soul or psyche. Sanchez was sued by Castaneda for infringement of copyright after including an eagle, desert, and other iconography on the covers of his books similar to that used by Castaneda. It is worth to notice that the law suit was not related to the contents of the book but to the initial design of the cover, which was not authored by Sanchez but by his publisher, Bear and Company, Inc.

He served as Bishop of Camden (1989‚Äì1998) and Bishop of Rockville Centre (2000). Early life and education James McHugh was born in Orange, New Jersey, to James T. and Caroline (n√©e Scavone) McHugh. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Venantius Church, and attended Our Lady of the Valley High School in Orange. He attended Seton Hall University in South Orange, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in classical languages. He then began his studies for the priesthood at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington, receiving a Master of Divinity degree. Priesthood On May 25, 1957, McHugh was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Newark at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. His first assignment was as a curate at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Newark, and he afterwards served at Holy Trinity Church in Fort Lee. He served as a member of the Archdiocesan Family Life Committee from 1962 to 1965. In addition to his pastoral duties, McHugh did graduate work in sociology at Fordham University in New York City from 1963 to 1965. He served as moderator of the Bergen County Catholic Physicians' Guild (1964‚Äì65) and of the Bergen County Catholic Nurses' Council (1963‚Äì65). He continued his studies in sociology at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. from 1965 to 1967. In 1965, he joined the staff of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, where he served as director of the Family Life Bureau (1965‚Äì75), director of the National Right to Life Committee (1967), and of the Office of Pro-Life Activities (1972‚Äì78). While in that position he caused controversy when in response to President Nixon's July 1969 proposal of federal funding of artificial contraception as a means of population control McHugh said the President's message was \\"a positive and constructive approach to the problem.\\" He was named a papal chamberlain in 1971, and raised to the rank of honorary prelate in 1986. McHugh was a visiting lecturer in theology at Princeton Theological Seminary (1974), Immaculate Conception Seminary (1976‚Äì81), and American College of Louvain in Belgium (1976). He became director of Diocesan Development Program for Natural Family Planning in 1981. From 1978 to 1981, he studied moral theology with a concentration in medical ethics at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology. He then served as a visiting lecturer at the Pontifical Lateran University in 1982. He served as special assistant at the World Synod of Bishops on \\"The Christian Family in the Contemporary World\\" in 1980, and was appointed to the delegation of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations in 1983. He was appointed archdiocesan vicar for Parish and Family Life in 1986. Episcopacy =Newark= On November 20, 1987, McHugh was appointed auxiliary bishop of Newark and titular bishop of Morosbisdus by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1988 from Archbishop Theodore Edgar McCarrick, with Archbishop Peter Leo Gerety and Bishop Walter William Curtis serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. He selected as his episcopal motto: Quid retribuam Domino, meaning, \\"What shall I return to the Lord\\" (). =Camden= Following the retirement of Bishop George Henry Guilfoyle, McHugh was named the fifth Bishop of Camden on May 13, 1989. His installation took place at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on June 20 of that year. During his nine-year tenure, he undertook a major reorganization of the diocese's administrative structure and authorized the relocation of the diocesan headquarters to downtown Camden. He presided over a diocesan synod in September 1992. Highly dedicated to the cause of Catholic education, he created a $63 million Catholic Education Endowment Fund for schools and religious education programs, a five-point plan to reinvigorate Catholic high schools, and led a grassroots effort to support school choice legislation in the state legislature. A strong opponent of abortion, he was a leading member of the National Conference of Bishops' Pro- Life Committee, and was known as the \\"father of the pro-life movement in America.\\" He served as a delegate at United Nations-sponsored conferences on the environment (1992 in Rio de Janeiro) and on population and development (1994 in Cairo). =Rockville Centre= He was appointed coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre on December 7, 1998, effective February 22, 1999.

Original data: Transcribed from LDS Family History Library copies of church records for this locality The couple settled in Philadelphia and had three children ‚Äì Amelia, who died after four weeks; a son, Washington Anthony; and another daughter, Emily, both of whom survived into adulthood.Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps, p. 46  Early career  Early in his Marine career, he fought, in fairly quick succession, the French, the Barbary pirates, the British, and a U.S. naval officer. Angered by the mistreatment of a Marine sentry, Gale killed Navy Lieutenant Allen MacKenzie in a duel. This incident, perceived to be an affront to the Corps,United States Marine Corps History Division Who's Who in Marine Corps History subsequently brought Commandant William W. Burrows' approval for Gale's defense of his Corps' honor. Later in his military career, Gale took \\"an active and gallant part\\" during the siege of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.Abbot, Willis John (1918). Soldiers of the Sea. New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, p. 79 Increasing rank brought other difficulties.Kettle Moraine Marine, A Colorful Commandant, p. 4 In 1815, while commanding at Philadelphia, he fell out with Commandant Franklin Wharton over construction of barracks. Wharton had been accused of overspending on the project, and he in turn charged Gale with building extravagant officers' quarters. Gale asserted that he had been given no specific plans and that Wharton had known what was being done. A court of inquiry cleared Gale, but he was banished to a less desirable post in New Orleans, where he allegedly nursed a feeling of persecution and began to drink heavily.Moskin, J. Robert (1977). The U.S. Marine Corps Story. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 98  Rise to Commandant  Brevet Major Gale, although next senior at the time of Wharton's death on September 1, 1818, had to battle for the job. At the time, the Corps was authorized only one lieutenant colonel and two majors. One could only rise in rank by virtue of the death or removal of a superior officer.Long, Richard A. (Undated). Anthony Gale. Incomplete manuscript, USMC Archives, Richard A Long Collection, Gale Series, Box 1, Folder 3, p. 8 When Wharton died, a scramble for the Commandant's job ensued.Moskin, The U.S. Marine Corps Story , p. 99 Major Samuel Miller, the adjutant and inspector at the Marine Corps Headquarters, two days after notifying Navy Secretary Benjamin Williams Crowninshield of Wharton's death, considering himself well suited for the job, suggested that he conduct the affairs of the commandancy until a successor was appointed. Brevet Major Archibald Henderson asserted that as the senior line officer present, he should be Acting Commandant.Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps , p. 49 Henderson was also characteristically blunt in giving his assessment of Gale's qualifications to the new Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson. In an attempt to discredit Gale, in February, 1819, Henderson and Miller participated in a court of inquiry resurrecting the old charges concerning Gale's tenure in Philadelphia. However, during his testimony, Henderson was forced to admit that his knowledge of Gale's misconduct was based on hearsay. Miller could similarly not provide firsthand evidence of wrongdoing by Gale.Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps , p. 48 After the court of inquiry exonerated him of these charges for the second time, Gale, with 21 years of service and therefore senior, became Lieutenant Colonel Commandant on March 3, 1819,Thompson, Smith (1819, March 5). Letter to Anthony Gale, subject: Appointment as Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps ending a six-month period during which the Corps had been leaderless.  Trouble as Commandant  Shortly after Gale assumed his post, Archibald Henderson circumvented Gale and wrote directly to Navy Secretary Smith Thompson requesting to join General Andrew Jackson who was serving as military governor in Florida.Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps , p. 50 Soon came more direct troubles with Smith Thompson, who frequently countermanded Gale's orders. Finally, on August 8, 1820, Gale submitted a letter analyzing the proper division of function between himself and the Secretary, pointing out the impossibility of his position. It was also alleged that he began to drink heavily at this time. Eight days after his letter, Gale was notified that the Secretary had unilaterally granted a four-week leave to one Marine captain and had suspended Gale's order sending another captain to the Mediterranean. Two weeks after that, on August 29, Gale was arrested and ordered to face court- martial.Moskin, The U.S. Marine Corps Story, p. 102  Court-martial  The charges against Gale were dated September 11, 1820. The first was that Gale was publicly intoxicated in the city of Washington on six specified dates during August, including August 31, two days after his arrest.Moskin, J. Robert (1977). The U.S. Marine Corps Story. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 103 The second charge was of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. There were three specifications: first, that Gale had visited a house of prostitution near the Marine Barracks \\"in open and disgraceful manner\\" on that same August 31; second, that he had on September 1 - a date on which he was in custody - called Lieutenant Richard M. Desha, the Corps' Paymaster and son of Congressman Joseph Desha of Kentucky \\\\- who had earlier charged Gale with misappropriation \\\\- \\"a damned rascal, liar and coward\\" and threatening him with personal chastisement unless he would immediately challenge and fight him; and, finally, that he had declared in front of the Marine Barracks \\"that he did not care a damn for the President, Jesus Christ or God Almighty!\\" The third charge was that Gale had signed a false certificate that said he had not used a Marine for personal services when in fact he had had a man assigned as waiter and coachman from October 17, 1819, until June 3, 1820. The fourth and final charge was that Gale had broken arrest \\"at sundry times\\" between September 1 and 8 while he was confined to quarters.Niles, William Ogden (1821) Niles Weekly Register, Volume XIX., Baltimore: Franklin Press, p. 132 Gale's court-martial was marked by further irregularities. Major Miller, one of Gale's rivals for the post of Commandant, despite having written the charges against Gale, was nonetheless appointed the prosecutor.Long, Anthony Gale, p. 9 Furthermore, Lieutenant Desha, a witness against Gale on the second charge, was appointed a supernumerary (or extra member) of the court, and was called to sit on the court in judgment of Gale when regular court members failed to appear. Desha objected to serving on the court under the circumstances, but the court overruled his objection on the grounds that Desha, not Gale, had objected.Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps, p. 52 The court found Gale guilty, President James Monroe approved the verdict, and Gale was removed from office and dismissed from the Marine Corps on October 18, 1820.Moskin, The U.S. Marine Corps Story, p. 104  Later life  From Washington, Gale went first to Philadelphia where he spent several months in a hospital,Pennsylvania Hospital Archives (1821).

Armed with proof that he had been under the strain of temporary mental derangement while Commandant, he spent fifteen years attempting to have his court-martial decision reversed. Eventually, in 1835, the government partially cleared him and awarded him a stipend of $15 a month, which was later increased to $25 and continued until his death.Long, Anthony Gale, p. 10 Although some sources identify he died on December 12, 1842,Millett and Shulimson, Commandants of the Marine Corps, p. 52 most sources,Nofi, Albert A. (1997). The Marine Corps Book of Lists. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press, p. 141 including the April 1844 pension petition filed by his widow, report his death to be on December 12, 1843. Over the years, several efforts have been undertaken by the Marines in an attempt to locate Commandant Gale's final resting place. All have proven unsuccessful. In lieu of a monument at his gravesite, on March 6, 2010, various detachments of the Marine Corps League of Kentucky dedicated a monument to Commandant Anthony Gale at the Lincoln County Courthouse in Stanford, Kentucky, near where he died and is likely buried. The Marine Corps League, Department of Kentucky, has taken, as an annual project, the traditional laying of the Commandant's wreath at this memorial on each November 10, the birthday of the Marines,Broihier, Michael (2010, March 11).

Nacatamal with both banana leaf and aluminum foil wrapping A nacatamal is a traditional dish found in Nicaragua similar to the tamal. The nacatamal is perhaps the most produced within traditional Nicaraguan cuisine and it is an event often reserved for Sundays at mid-morning, it is usually eaten together with fresh bread and coffee. It is common to enjoy nacatamales (plural) during special occasions and to invite extended family and neighbors to partake. Nacatamales tied in plantain leaves ready to be steamed Ingredients A nacatamal is made up of mostly nixtamalized corn masa (a kind of dough traditionally made from a process called nizquezar) and lard, but includes seasonings such as salt and achiote (annatto). This combination is traditionally cooked in a large batch over a wood fire. The result becomes the base for the nacatamal and it is also referred to as masa. This base is ladled onto plantain leaves used for wrapping into large individual portions. The leaves undergo their own preparation separately. Before a nacatamal can be wrapped and brought to the last stage of the cooking process, it must be filled. The filling usually consists of annatto-seasoned pork meat, rice, slices of potatoes, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions; olives, spearmint sprigs, and chile , a very small, egg-shaped chile found in Nicaragua. On occasion, prunes, raisins or capers can be added. The masa and filling are then wrapped in the plantain leaves, tied with a string, and made into pillow- shaped bundles - nacatamales. They are then steamed or pressure-cooked for several hours. The entire process is very labor-intensive and it often requires preparation over the course of two days; it may be necessary to involve the whole family to complete it. Today it is common to wrap Nacatamales in both banana leaf and aluminum foil before boiling. Boiling takes up to 5 hours and at the midway point the Nacatamales are rotated top to bottom - bottom to top to facilitate even cooking. =Pindongo, no-chile option= Nacatamales can also be made pindongo (with no pork) for religious reasons like the Nicaraguan-Jewish community or with no chile, for people with sensitive stomachs.

As a member of the Timurid dynasty, Abdullah Mirza was a great- grandson of Timur, a grandson of Shah Rukh and a son of Ibrahim Sultan. Granted the governorship of Fars by his grandfather, Abdullah Mirza found his position threatened by his cousin Sultan Muhammad during the 1447 succession crisis which followed Shah Rukh's death, and was forced to abandon the province. As a supporter of Ulugh Beg, he was imprisoned by 'Abd al-Latif following the latter's rise to power. When 'Abd al-Latif was murdered, he was released and made ruler of Samarkand, for which he was forced to lavish money upon the troops that supported him. Despite this, he did not enjoy widespread popularity. During his relatively brief reign, a revolt created by Sultan Muhammad's brother Ala al-Dawla Mirza did not seriously threaten him, but a rising initiated by Abu Sa'id Mirza, whose home base, at the time, was in Bukhara, proved to be fatal. Marching from Tashkent to Samarkand with the support of Abu'l-Khayr Khan, Abu Sa'id Mirza defeated Abdullah Mirza and executed him in 1451, taking his place on the throne. References *Roemer, H. R.

Lima Lima Flight team performing at Thunder over Louisville, April 2009. The name derives from the FAA identifier of the field where the team originated. Naper Aero Club (LL-10) is located in the western suburbs of Chicago. It is an airport community, with 100 homes connected to its two runways via taxiways behind the homes. The original flying club (Mentor Flyers, Inc.) which spawned the Lima Lima team is still based at LL-10, but the founding members who lived there have since moved on, and the team is now a truly national team, with members in Illinois, Ohio, California, and Florida. The Lima Lima Flight Team flies the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor. The Mentor was the brainchild of Walter Beech and was the last airplane he designed. Beech developed the T-34 as a private venture, hoping to sell it to the military as a replacement for the North American T-6/SNJ trainer, which had trained thousands of military aviators during World War II. First flown in 1949, the Mentor was demonstrated for civilian audiences nationwide by famed aerobatic pilots Betty Skelton and Bevo Howard. The Mentor eventually won a competition to determine the new primary trainer, beating out entries by Ryan and Temco. The T-34 entered USAF service (T-34A) in 1953 and Navy service (T-34B) in 1955. The USAF phased the T-34 out in 1959, but the Navy continues to fly a later version of the Mentor (T-34C) today. T-34s were built under license in Canada, Japan, America and Argentina. The Lima Lima Flight Team flies a civilianized and much-improved version of the original Mentor, with modern avionics and more powerful engines. The military recognizes different levels of formation skills, from basic tactical formation flying to the air show performances of the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds. Lima Lima has evolved in the same way. Charter members of the team were at the forefront of the civilian formation certification program instituted by the T-34 Association in 1983, and eventually adopted by all civilian warbird organizations. The skills developed in this program have been expanded to include a series of formation maneuvers which mirror those of the jet teams. The Lima Lima Flight Team demonstration showcases the full range of the T-34 performance envelope. Though the T-34 is much slower than the jets flown by military teams, the turn rates are over double those of the F-16 and F/A-18. The result is a performance which has no ‚Äúdead time‚Äù. There is smoke and action in front of spectators for the entire 20 minute demonstration. The Lima Lima Flight Team celebrates its 19th year of professional air show performances in 2006. In that time, the team has traveled from coast-to-coast and border-to-border and beyond, performing in Alaska, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. The 2006 team is made up of professional airline pilots, retired military pilots, medical professionals, and successful businessmen. This eclectic mix of personnel provides a unique team personality.

As of February 24, 2017, Intersil is a subsidiary of Renesas. The previous Intersil was formed in August 1999 through the acquisition of the semiconductor business of Harris Corporation.http://harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?pr_id=625 http://harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?pr_id=483 Intersil is a power management IC business, with specialized capability in power management and precision analog technology for applications in industrial, infrastructure, mobile, automotive and aerospace. Company history The original Intersil, Inc. was founded in 1967 by the Swiss physicist Jean Hoerni to develop digital watch Integrated Circuits (ICs). The European subsidiary Eurosil was originally partially funded by SSIH, a Swiss watch company. Later-on, Intersil had a development contract with the Japanese company Daini Seikosha and became supplier of low-voltage CMOS watch ICs for Seiko.Lucien Trueb: Die Elektrifizierung der Armbanduhr. Ebner, Ulm 2011, When microprocessors emerged to the market in the 1970s, Intersil participated with its 12-bit IM6100, which was the first microprocessor produced in CMOS technology and emulated the PDP-8 instruction set. In 1988 Intersil was taken over by Harris Semiconductor, which had offered the IM6100 as second source. Harris combined these activities with the semiconductor divisions of Radiation Incorporated, General Electric and RCA they had taken over before. In 1999 Harris spun off its entire semiconductor division and Intersil Corporation was created with the largest IPO in American semiconductor industry history.IntersilÂ∫ÜÁ•ùÊàêÁ´ã10Âë®Âπ¥ The second Intersil Corporation is a different company from the original Intersil, Inc. Next to digital circuits like microprocessors and memories like the 1k-bit CMOS RAM IM6508 and CMOS EPROMS IM6604/IM6654 Intersil designed famous analogue ICs like the ICM8038 waveform generator. A creation of Intersil (as Harris Semiconductor) is the PRISM line of Wi-Fi hardware: that group of products was sold to GlobespanVirata in 2003, and maintained by Conexant. Intersil is the manufacturer of the RCA (CDP)1802 microprocessor (also known as RCA COSMAC), a CPU traditionally used in space applications. In the 2000s, Intersil established market leadership in Vcore power management for PCs, switching and buck boost regulators for industrial and consumer power systems, and radiation hardened analog and power ICs for military and commercial applications. The company, under CEO Dave Bell, then began the expansion of a catalog analog business. The company also completed a series of acquisitions, two of which are still part of the portfolio, Zilker Labs digital power devices and Techwell automotive and security and surveillance products. In 2012, with revenue in decline, the company's board of directors removed Dave Bell and began a search for a new CEO. In March 2013, the board appointed Necip Sayiner, the architect of Silicon Labs' turnaround, as CEO. Sayiner concentrated the company's efforts on power management and select target markets. The company was able to return to profitabilityhttp://intersil.presscentre.com/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=121&SizeId;=-1 in 2013 and in early 2014 re-launched as a power management company, with products to improve power efficiency, extend battery life and reduce size.

He is fluent in English, Italian, French and Spanish. Allegations of protecting abusive priests Bishop Murphy has denied that he helped to protect abusive priests while he was second in command at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, before coming to Long Island in 2001.New York Times: \\"L.I. Bishop Is Accused Of Shielding Sex Abusers\\" February 12, 2004National Catholic Reporter: \\"Records reveal bishops‚Äôs role in Boston scandal\\" March 7, 2003 Murphy's denials contradicted a July 2010 report by the Massachusetts attorney general that stated that Murphy \\"placed a higher priority on preventing scandal and providing support to alleged abusers than on protecting children from sexual abuse.\\"New York Times: \\"Priests Say Murphy Takes a First Step' January 25, 2004 The report also stated: \\"There is overwhelming evidence that for many years Cardinal Law and his senior managers (Bishop Murphy is identified in the report as a senior manager and a top archdiocesan official) had direct, actual knowledge that substantial numbers of children in the Archdiocese had been sexually abused by substantial numbers of priests.‚ÄùVoice of the Faithful Press Release: \\"L.I.-VOTF Calls for Bishop Murphy's Resignation\\" August 1, 2003 The Catholic League defended Murphy, contending, amongst other things, that the allegations were unfounded and that Massachusetts did not require clergy at the time to report abuse; and the internal pastoral response was at the time the norm in all religions. The League also praised Murphy‚Äôs leadership and actions on issues involving sexual abuse since his appointment to the Diocese of Rockville Centre in September 2001.Catholic League: \\"The Catholic League's Response to Voice of the Faithful's Criticism of Bishop Murphy\\" August 23, 2003 Bishop Accountability.Org says Murphy is \\"a key figure in the sexual abuse crisis, both because of his earlier role in the Boston archdiocese and because of conditions in Rockville Centre.\\" Bishop Accountability.Org: William F. Murphy, Rockville Centre NY Monsignor Alan J. Placa, a Rockville Centre diocesan priest, was cleared by the tribunal of the Diocese of Albany, the home diocese of the complainant, of allegations made against him in June 2002. The decision was subsequently confirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which instructed Murphy \\"to do what we can to restore his good name.‚Äù\\"Rockville Centre priest accused of abuse cleared, restored to ministry\\", Catholic Review, January 19, 2012 Renovation of bishop's quarters Newsday reporter Jimmy Breslin criticized Murphy for spending more than US$5 million on renovations for St. Agnes Cathedral that included the creation of a private residence for himself. Murphy took over the third floor of an old convent that was being renovated to accommodate six nuns and requested them to relocate. The convent had room for 37 apartments. \\"The sisters, I think, were disappointed,\\" Murphy said, \\"but a disappointment they expressed with great generosity. They understood my dilemma.\\" Murphy deemed his current living quarters in the cathedral rectory as unsatisfactory because they lacked privacy, and that a separate donated house was not large enough to entertain visiting prelates. After construction started, the original estimate of $500,000 for construction and furnishings increased to $800,000. Murphy then invited another Newsday reporter and photographer to review the accommodations. They reported that the suite consisted of a lavishly decorated living room, a new fireplace with an oak mantel, a kitchen with top-of-the- line appliances (including a temperature-controlled wine storage cabinet for 50 bottles of wine), a marble bathroom, a bedroom and study for the bishop's secretary, a separate suite called \\"the cardinal‚Äôs suite,\\" and a public wing with a fourth bedroom for visiting laity. Murphy believes that the cost was justified since the new bishop's residence can serve simultaneously as a residence for the bishop, his secretary, the cardinal, and other visiting laity. Shortly after the story about the new residence broke, the local Catholic Charities branch operating in the Diocese of Rockville Centre announced that it was terminating a $1.1 million home care program that had served 500 poor, mentally ill people on Long Island. Catholic Charities attributed its decision to ‚Äúmounting expenses.‚Äù Kate Bishop, the program‚Äôs coordinator stated to the press: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that our deficit [$140,000] is about the same amount as what the church is spending on the kitchen appliances and Oriental rugs in the [bishop‚Äôs] residence.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur mission is to serve people who are marginalized and disenfranchised. For them to turn around, with no notice, and end the program, is horrible.‚ÄùRyan, Dick. \\"One bishop‚Äôs high cost of living\\", National Catholic Reporter October 25, 2002 Discontent amongst diocesan priests In October 2003, 52 priests requested a meeting with Murphy after sending a letter that spoke of a \\"general malaise and even an abiding anger\\" within the diocese, \\"a fairly widespread dissatisfaction with the way you have related to some clergy and the laity\\" and \\"a certain lack of confidence in your pastoral leadership.\\" Issues raised included Bishop Murphy's management style, the excessive cost of renovating a diocesan building into his personal residence, ongoing concerns of how he handled the sexual abuse scandal, and his ban against the 1,000 member reform group Long Island Voice of the Faithful, which has asked Murphy to resign, from meeting on church property.Voice of the Faithful: Our Request To Bishop Murphy to Resign July 29, 2003New York Times: \\"Can a Mediator Heal the Rift in the Diocese?\\" March 19, 2006 Catholic school closings On December 5, 2011, Murphy made the decision to close six Roman Catholic elementary schools on Long Island (St. John Baptist de La Salle Regional School in Farmingdale, St. Catherine of Sienna School in Franklin Square, St. Ignatius Loyola School in Hicksville, Sacred Heart School in North Merrick, Our Lady of Perpetual Help School in Lindenhurst and Prince of Peace Regional School in Sayville). Students of Saint Catherine of Sienna School held a protest on December 21, 2011. Podium speakers stated that several munificent parishioners offered to make sizable donations to meet the relatively small financial shortcomings of the parish school, which they claimed Murphy would not entertain.

He was also the Secretary of the Alabama Territory, the position which was the precursor to the modern-day Secretary of State of Alabama.List of past Secretaries of State of Alabama , from the Office Secretary of State of Alabama Early years Henry Hitchcock was born in Burlington, Vermont in 1792. He was the grandson of General Ethan Allen, leader of the Green Mountain Boys and hero of Ticonderoga, and the son of Judge Samuel Hitchcock. Major General Ethan Allen Hitchcock was his brother. Henry Hitchcock's son, Ethan Hitcocock, served as United States Secretary of the Interior under William McKinley. Another son, Henry Hitchcock, was a prominent attorney in St. Louis, Missouri. Henry Hitchcock attended Middlebury College for a while and then graduated from the University of Vermont in 1811. While studying law, he cultivated a small farm in order to provide for the needs of his family. He became a member of the bar in 1815 and handled several important lawsuits before leaving Burlington for the lure of what was then called the Southwest. He traveled by flat boat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, eventually arriving in Mobile on January 22, 1816, after a brief stay in Natchez. Political career On May 14, 1818, six months after the creation of the Alabama Territory, Hitchcock was appointed its first secretary by Governor William Wyatt Bibb. He also participated in the writing of Alabama's first constitution, representing Washington County in the constitutional convention in Huntsville on July 5, 1819. Hitchcock was elected as the State's first Attorney General by the General Assembly in December 1819. In 1821, he married Ann Erwin (1803-1854). Two sons were Henry Hitchcock[1829-1902] a prominent attorney in St. Louis, Missouri and Ethan Hitcocock [1835-], served as United States Secretary of the Interior under William McKinley. Hitchcock then had the distinction of producing the first book printed in the State of Alabama entitled, The Alabama Juctice of the Peace, Containing All the Duties, Powers and Authorities of That Office, which was published in Cahawaba, Alabama, in 1822. In 1826, Hitchcock was appointed United States District Attorney for the Mobile region. On January 9. 1835, Hitchcock was elected to fill a vacancy on the Alabama Supreme Court. He became Chief Justice in June 1836. Hitchcock was also a very astute businessman, reputedly the wealthiest man in Alabama before feeling the effects of the Panic of 1837. On August 11, 1839, Hitchcock succumbed to yellow fever during one of the worst epidemics of that disease in Mobile's history.

It was developed by Eurocom and released exclusively on the Dreamcast as a launch title. It is an updated version of 1997's Mortal Kombat 4 and was the first game to appear on a sixth-generation platform as well as the only Mortal Kombat game to be released for the Dreamcast console. Critical reaction was mostly average due to the graphics being inferior to the arcade version, the weapons deemed boring or useless, and game-breaking bugs and glitches. Gameplay Mortal Kombat Gold's gameplay is largely based on that of Mortal Kombat 4 and includes several additional characters and stages not seen in Mortal Kombat 4, as well as a new weapon selection mechanism. New stages include Church, Ladder, Netherrealm and Soul Chamber. Characters Kung Lao fighting against Baraka in the Soul Chamber arena Mortal Kombat Gold features the same character roster as Mortal Kombat 4, which includes Liu Kang, Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, Sub- Zero, Reiko, Jarek, Raiden, Tanya, Scorpion, Kai, Reptile, Fujin, Shinnok, Quan Chi, sub-boss Goro, and the secret characters Noob Saibot and Meat. In addition, Gold also features six additional characters, Kitana, Mileena, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Baraka and secret character Sektor, who were not featured in any version of Mortal Kombat 4 but had been featured in previous installments of the franchise. Although the game's storyline is identical to that of Mortal Kombat 4, the official strategy guide for the game misprinted unused bios for the six new returning characters, causing some confusion among fans. An additional character named Belokk was planned for the game, but was omitted from the finished version due to time constraints. However, Eurocom accidentally sent information about the character to Game Informer, and as a result, six screenshots of him were released to the public, sparking rumors about him being actually accessible somehow. Release About a month after the initial launch, a revised version of the game was released, which intended to address some of its most severe issues. This version fixed the most severe bugs and glitches in the game and added VMU memory card support, which allowed the save feature to function properly. This version was released on a red tinted disc, as opposed to the original's gold tint, and was easily identified by a green \\"Hot! New!\\" logo on the instruction manual's cover. Reception Mortal Kombat Gold received an averaged review score of only 54.97% at GameRankings. Despite having the graphics that were the most faithful to the arcade version of all the home versions of Mortal Kombat 4, Game Revolution rated it a D and commented that \\"the graphics are inexcusably horrible\\" and \\"it's quite a depressing let-down on Sega's 128-bit masterpiece, especially when compared to Soulcalibur.\\" The weapons that characters can use during the game were called \\"dull and uninteresting\\", often having little relation to the characters, and being \\"either a sword, axe, or club\\". IGN was less negative toward the game, awarding it a 6.3 out of 10, but was particularly critical regarding the weapon system: \\"Readying your weapon is a slow process in which one can be hit any number of times during the attempt\\". Although IGN commented on the improvements from previous Mortal Kombat games, the lack of depth was considered inexcusable. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot, who gave the game a score of 5.0/10, wrote that \\"sitting down and playing MK Gold almost feels like a retrogaming experience - you really feel as though you've pulled out some old game that you haven't played in years - and it hasn't aged gracefully.\\" According to a retrospective by IGN, \\"the same publications that had once praised it on Nintendo 64 were happy to thrash it as a shallow and campy relic of a past age. Releasing beside Soulcalibur certainly didn't help.\\" Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Mortal Kombat Gold goes a long way towards confirming that this series peaked with MK2, and it's been in steady decline ever since.\\" References External links * *Mortal Kombat Gold at Radgegaming 1999 video games 3D fighting games Dreamcast games Dreamcast-only games Eurocom games Cancelled arcade games Midway video games Mortal Kombat games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Mortal Kombat Gold"},{"id":"1788886","text":"Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest (1904) is an exotic romance by William Henry Hudson about a traveller to the Guyana jungle of southeastern Venezuela and his encounter with a forest dwelling girl named Rima. The principal characters are Abel, Rima, Nuflo, Cla-Cla and Kua-k√≥. Plot summary Prologue: An unnamed narrator tells how he befriended an old \\"Hispano-American\\" gentleman who never spoke of his past. His interest piqued, the narrator finally elicits the story. Venezuela, c. 1875. Abel, a young man of wealth, fails at a revolution and flees Caracas into the uncharted forests of Guayana. Surviving fever, failing at journal-keeping and gold hunting, he settles in an Indian village to waste away his life: playing guitar for old Cla-Cla, hunting badly with Kua-k√≥, telling stories to the children. After some exploring, Abel discovers an enchanting forest where he hears a strange bird-like singing. His Indian friends avoid the forest because of its evil spirit-protector, \\"the Daughter of the Didi.\\" Persisting in the search, Abel finally finds Rima the Bird Girl. She has dark hair, a smock of spider webs, and can communicate with birds in an unknown tongue. When she shields a coral snake, Abel is bitten and falls unconscious. Abel awakens in the hut of Nuflo, an old man who protects his \\"granddaughter\\" Rima, and won't reveal her origin. As Abel recovers, Rima leads him through the forest, and Abel wonders about her identity and place of origin. Abel returns to the Indians, but relations become icy, because they would kill Rima, if they could. Rima often speaks of her dead mother, who was always depressed. Abel falls in love with Rima, but she (17 and a stranger to white men) is confused by \\"odd feelings\\". This relationship is further strained because Abel cannot speak her unknown language. Atop Ytaiao Mountain, Rima questions Abel about \\"the world\\" known and unknown, asking him if she was unique and alone. Abel sadly reveals that it is true. However, when he mentions the storied mountains of Riolama, Rima perks up. It turns out that \\"Riolama\\" is her real name. Nuflo must know where Riolama is, so a wrathful Rima demands that Nuflo guide her to Riolama under threats of eternal damnation from her sainted mother. Old, guilty and religious, Nuflo caves in to the pressure. Abel pays a last visit to the Indians, but they capture him as a prisoner, suspecting that he is a spy for an enemy tribe or consorts with demons. Abel manages to escape and return to Rima and Nuflo. The three then trek to distant Riolama. Along the way, Nuflo reveals his past, and Rima's origin. Seventeen years ago, Nuflo led bandits who preyed on Christians and Indians. Eventually, forced to flee to the mountains, they found a cave to live in. Hiding in the cave was a strange woman speaking a bird-like language. She was to be Rima's mother (never named). Nuflo assumed the woman was a saint sent to save his soul. Nuflo left the bandits and carried Rima's mother, now crippled for life, to Voa, a Christian community, to deliver Rima. Rima and her mother talked in their magical language for seven years, until Mother wasted away in the dampness and died. As contrition, Nuflo brought Rima to the drier mountains. The local Indians found her queer, and resented how she chased off game animals, and therefore tried to kill her. A mis-shot dart killed an Indian, and they fled Rima's \\"magic\\". In the cave, Rima is eager to enter Riolama valley. Abel reveals sad news: her mother left because nothing remained. She belonged to a gentle, vegetarian people without weapons, who were wiped out by Indians, plague and other causes. Rima is indeed unique and alone. Rima is saddened but suspected it: her mother was always depressed. Now she decides to return to the forest and prepare a life for herself and Abel. She flits away, leaving Abel to fret as he and Nuflo walk home, delayed by rain and hunger. They return to find the forest silent, Nuflo's hut burned down, and Indians hunting game. Abel, exhausted, is again taken prisoner, but isn't killed, as he quickly makes a vow to go to war against the enemy tribe. On the war trail, he drops hints about Rima and her whereabouts. Kua-Ko explains how, thanks to Abel's \\"bravery\\", the Indians dared enter the forbidden forest. They caught Rima in the open, chased her up the giant tree. They heaped brush underneath it and burned Rima. Abel kills Kua-k√≥ and runs to the enemy tribe, sounding the alarm. Days later he returns. All his Indian friends are dead. He finds the giant tree burned, and collects Rima's ashes in a pot. Trekking homeward, despondent and hallucinating, Abel is helped by Indians and Christians until he reaches the sea, sane and healthy again. Now an old man, his only ambition is to be buried with Rima's ashes. Reflecting back, he believes neither God nor man can forgive his sins, but that gentle Rima would, provided he has forgiven himself. Background Hudson based Rima and her lost tribe on persistent rumours about a tribe of white people who lived in the mountains.Compare the White Aethiopians. Temple paintings often showed light- skinned people, and Spanish Conquistadors were at first thought to be gods. Green Mansions also features some cryptozoological concepts such as Curupita (Curupira) and Didi purportedly representing giant apes unknown by science. Many authors of the time also recounted \\"lost worlds\\" and \\"lost tribes\\", the most successful being H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard and Arthur Conan Doyle. Hudson's book has endured as literature because of its evocative and lyrical prose, and his naturalist's keen vision of the jungle. Rima also exemplifies the \\"natural man\\", a philosophical notion put forth by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others, that someone raised away from corrupting civilisation would be naturally pure of heart and attuned to their environment. Tarzan, raised by apes, and Mowgli, raised by wolves, are Rima's literary cousins. In the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation, the editor says, \\"We also feel that Hudson wants to tell us in this story that, long before this present meat-eating and destructive race took over all the world, there was a race of beings on the earth ‚Äì beautiful, innocent, and bird-like, who lived in peace with nature and themselves, and of whom Rima and her mother were the last\\".Classics Illustrated No. 90, \\"William Henry Hudson\\". The title may spring from the Bible quote \\"In my Father's house are many mansions\\" (John 14:2), implying the pristine forest is a natural and sacred cathedral. The plot of the book resembles that in Hudson's earlier novel A Crystal Age.  Book publication  The book was originally published in 1904. A new edition of this book published in the United States in 1912 with a foreword by John Galsworthy. It was one of the first books published by Alfred A. Knopf and their first bestseller. The book went through nine printings by 1919 and had sold over 20,000 copies. This also created interest in Hudson's other titles. Film, TV, theatrical and comic book adaptations In 1937, Louis Gruenberg (1884‚Äì1964) composed a radio opera Green Mansions, which used a musical saw in the score. In 1951, Gilberton Publishing released a comic book adaptation of Green Mansions as issue number 90 in their Classics Illustrated series. Direct quotes from the novel were used. In this adaptation Rima is blonde. The art was by Alex Blum, who drew many other issues of the Classics Illustrated series. In 1959, the book was adapted into a movie, also entitled Green Mansions, starring Audrey Hepburn as Rima, with Anthony Perkins as Abel. The film, which was directed by Hepburn's husband, Mel Ferrer, was a critical and box office failure. In the early 1970s, one of the more unusual adaptations of Green Mansions occurred when DC Comics launched the comic book Rima the Jungle Girl, featuring the title character recast as a Sheena-like action hero. This version of the character later appeared on the animated TV series Super Friends. Rima the Jungle Girl returned to the DC Universe in a new pulp-era comic debuting in 2010 entitled First Wave. Rima was portrayed as a South American native with piercings and tattoos, who didn't speak, but communicated in bird-like whistles. Plying a big knife and a panther, she helped Doc Savage's assistant Johnny Littlejohn, then disappeared back into the forest. In her 1973 story The Girl Who Was Plugged In, James Tiptree Jr.'s character Paul Isham III finds inspiration from the novel to abduct and rescue a beautiful but ill-fated young girl named Delphi ‚Äî unknown to him, an advertising puppet operated by a deformed pilot‚Äîwho Isham identifies with Rima.

The site is unlikely to be the same as an earlier fort the French document as Hangard dated to 1754 and which was confusedly, likely located on the nearby stream called Redstone Creek.located about a mile and a half (downriver) to the north, or slightly less than one mile north of the site of the elevated bridge of today's U.S. Route 40 and Nemacolin Castle but the naming situation which is already confused because that means the Hangard blockhouse was located along the banks of the larger Redstone Creek along the east bank of the Monongahela, down slope from where Nemacolin Castle was constructed on the bluffs above. Red sandstones predominate the deposited rock column of the entire region. History =Early trail improvements= Geopolitically, Redstone was a frequent point of embarkation to cross the Monongahela River for travelers who had crossed the Alleghenies or were heading west via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers by boat. Its strategic importance had long been recognized and used by the Indians, and it was a target terminus of Braddock's Road during the French and Indian War. Redstone Old Fort was the terminus of an Indian trail which settlers improved around the 1750. They afterward called it Nemacolin's Trail, named after the Indian chief who assisted the improvement through the mountain pass.Minish, Bill. \\"Family History of Richard C. Minish (1770‚Äì1808): Dorchester County, Maryland\\" From this area, travelers could travel by water downstream on the Monongahela river to what is now Pittsburgh, or overland, by trails that later became Brownsville Road to the same destination. The fortress site was chosen to guard and command the crossing pointThe Mon river ford and related shallows were arrayed slightly upstream (south) in the vicinity of the Old U.S. Route 40 steel arch bridge connecting to West Brownsville. Fort Burd was the last fort built by Colonel Burd, who'd spent most of the prior two years overseeing construction of forts in western Pennsylvania. Since a location on the south bank of Dunlap's Creek would have had a commanding field of fire (militarily) over the nearly adjacent river fording point. Nemacolin's Trail likely continued along the opposite bank of the Mon river south and upstream‚Äîthe path of Pennsylvania Route 88 southbound away from California, Pennsylvania. of the formidable east-west obstacle of the Monongahela River along the route of an Indian trail from the Potomac River‚Äîalong one of the few mountain passes allowing traffic between the Ohio Country and the eastern seaboard cities. During 1749 and 1750, the Delaware Indian chief Nemacolin and Maryland frontiersman Thomas Cresap supervised improving the trail from the east to Redstone Creek, but Chief Nemacolin was a continuing presence in the war against the Mingo and Shawnee, and anecdotes place him at Nemacolin Castle waiting for Colonel Burd. =French and Indian War= Col. James Burd ordered construction of the fort in 1759 on an earthwork mound left behind by prehistoric Indians, known as the Mound Builders. The American colonists called these mounds \\"old forts\\", and this one had large red sandstone blocks that had been placed at the top, suggesting the site had been a fortress of some kind. It was also, after the area was settled, the site of the local settlement of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and the place they called \\"Redstone Meeting\\". Around this time (1750s-1760s) a far sighted businessman-farmer, anticipating that any settlements west of the Alleghenies had to funnel down Nemacolin's Trail to the River crossing acted to acquire ownership of the lands, which ultimately gave the area its later historic and current name: Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Brown himself did not move to the lands but acted as landlord and real estate magnate, selling much of the land piecemeal, and large plots to Jacob Bowman, who became a prime mover in the tremendous industrial development of the town. =Lord Dunmore's War= Redstone Old Fort proved significant in the Colony of Virginia's war against the Mingo and Shawnee tribes, known as Lord Dunmore's War (1774‚Äì75). It was occupied by Capt. Michael Cresap, owner of a trading post, to prevent the local Shawnee from controlling it. Under authority of the colonial government of Virginia, Cresap had taken up extensive tracts of land at and below the mouth of Middle Island Creek (now Sistersville, West Virginia). He had gone there in the early spring of 1774 with a party of men to settle his holdings. Ebenezer Zane, afterward a famed Indian fighter and guide, was engaged at the same time and in the same way with a small party of men on lands which he had taken up at or near the mouth of Sandy Creek. A group under the command of James Harrod left the fort 25 May 1774 going down river to settle lands in Kentucky, but returned to the fort due to the threat from the Shawnee.\\"GERMANNA History Notes Page #026 Nr. 631\\" A third and larger group that included George Rogers Clark, had gathered at the mouth of the Little Kanawha River (the present site of Parkersburg, West Virginia). They were waiting there for the arrival of other Virginians who were expected to join them at that point before moving downriver to settle lands in Kentucky. =After the American Revolution= In 1789, historic Nemacolin Castle, trading post, and tavern was built up on the bluff about 0.75 miles to the east along Burd's Road (the western stretch of The Nemacolin Trail through Brownsville and across Washington County to Wheeling, West Virginia eastwards to the junction with Braddock's Road in Uniontown by Bowman near Redstone Old Fort and this crossing, at what became a major link in the first National Road at what is today the towns of West Brownsville and Brownsville. The early settlement around the fort also came to be called Redstone, but eventually became known as Brownsville, Pennsylvania after its farsighted developer Thomas Brown. The use of \\"Redstone\\" devolved to apply to just one of its neighborhoods. Redstone Old Fort is mentioned in C. M. Ewing's The Causes of That So Called Whiskey Insurrection of 1794 (1930) as being the site of a July 27, 1791, meeting in \\"Opposition to the Whiskey Excise Tax,\\" during the Whiskey Rebellion. It was the first illegal meeting of that insurrection.\\"Timeline\\", Whiskey Rebellion In 1803 Meriwether Lewis mentioned Redstone Old Fort in a letter to President Thomas Jefferson, in which he detailed his route from Harper's Ferry to Pittsburgh.

It was signed at Canandaigua, New York on November 11, 1794, by fifty sachems and war chiefs representing the Grand Council of the Six Nations of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy (including the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora tribes), and by Timothy Pickering, official agent of President George Washington. Background of the treaty The Treaty of Canandaigua arose out of a combination of geo-political tensions. In the aftermath of its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, England was forced to relinquish its land east of the Mississippi River to the United States. However, England‚Äôs original rights to this territory were unclear, causing resentment among the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, to whom the land originally belonged. Moreover, some indigenous peoples on the western frontier of the United States remained loyal to the British after the American Revolutionary War and were hostile towards the United States. The United States faced resentment from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy over their acceptance of land in the Ohio Valley from England and faced the threat of another war on its western frontier. In order to avoid war, the United States government sought to define a solid boundary on its western frontier. It also recognized that peace with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was critical at this point in case another war did break out. The United States attempted to make peace with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy with a series of conferences and treaties: the treaties of Fort Stanwix and Fort Harmar. However, both treaties were considered failures by the United States government because they resulted in increased tension with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. United States Secretary of War Henry Knox began a military operation on the western frontier in September 1790 and appointed Indian commissioner Timothy Pickering to address the Haudenosaunee Confederacy‚Äôs grievances with the United States government. Pickering decided to follow a ‚Äústrategy of conciliation and compromise‚Äù, beginning with a conference with the Seneca Nation to offer gifts and peace after the failed treaties of Fort Harmar and Fort Stanwix. A series of conferences followed, in which Pickering opened dialogue between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the United States regarding what was to become of the land that England had lost. In October 1791. Knox‚Äôs military efforts of the western frontier were failing, and he suggested enlisting the Haudenosaunee Confederacy to fight on behalf of the United States. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, along with Pickering, were unimpressed by Knox‚Äôs request, and declined to participate in the war. In 1793, the military operation on the western frontier broke out into war, escalating the situation in the Ohio Valley. In June of 1794, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy proposed a conference at Buffalo Creek, in which the Haudenosaunee Confederacy rejected the Fort Harmar and Fort Stanwix treaties, resulting in the United States ceding land to the Seneca Nation. Afraid that the Haudenosaunee Confederacy would join the opposition at the western frontier, the United States held the first conference for the Treaty of Canandaigua in September 1794. The official conference for the Treaty of Canandaigua began on October 18, 1794, with more than 1,500 members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy present. Deliberations were tense at first because of discrepancies of culture beliefs on treaties. According to scholar Granville Ganter, ‚Äúunlike their Anglo counterparts, the Haudenosaunee saw treaty agreements as requiring constant renewal and upkeep. The term they used was ‚Äòbrightening the chain of friendship‚Äô‚Äù. Seneca leader Red Jacket played an integral role in helping Pickering overcome some of these ideological differences throughout the deliberations. He ‚Äúreminded Pickering that making peace requires declarations that mean one thing ‚Äì peace ‚Äì and mixing in language of blame or criticism simply fouls the process‚Äù. Another ideological difference between the United States and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy during deliberations was the role of women. No United States settler women were included in the dialogue; however, Haudenosaunee women, in keeping with their significant role in tribal governance, were included. Historian Joan M. Jensen states that Seneca women ‚Äúspoke during the negotiations of the Treaty of 1794 with the United States government‚Äù. The conference ended on November 11, 1794, when fifty-nine war chiefs and sachems signed the treaty, and the text of the Canandaigua treaty, which comprised seven articles, was submitted to the U.S. Senate on January 2, 1795, carrying the title: \\"The Six Nations, and Oneida, Tuscarora, and Stockbridge Tribes'‚Äù.  Terms of the treaty  Territory of the Seneca Nation in 1794 The treaty established peace and friendship between the United States of America and the Six Nations, and affirmed Haudenosaunee land rights in the state of New York, and the boundaries established by the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1788. Article One of the treaty promises ‚Äúperpetual peace and friendship‚Äù between America and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.Kappler, Charles J. (1904). Laws and Treaties. Washington, D.C., National Archives: 3 Article Two acknowledges lands belonging to the Oneida and gives them the legal right to sell the land if they so wish and Article Three legally defines the perimeter of Seneca territories. Article Four maintains that America must not ‚Äúclaim or disturb‚Äù any lands belonging to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Article Five legally acknowledges that the road from ‚ÄúFort Schlosser to Lake Erie, as far south as Buffalo Creek‚Äù belongs to the Seneca Nation. Article Six promises $4500 each year to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy from America.Kappler, Charles J. (1904). Laws and Treaties. Washington, D.C., National Archives: 4 Article Seven states that if the ‚Äúperpetual peace and friendship‚Äù between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and America were to be disturbed in any way, that the conflict would be resolved peacefully by a third party.  Legacy  =Current status= Article 6 continues to be honored by the contracting parties. Article 6 of the treaty provides that the U.S. government annually provide goods valued at $4,500. To date, Haudenosaunee leaders have insisted that the payment be made with bolts of cloth, rather than cash, as a means of adhering to the terms of the largely dishonored treaty. Article 2, which ensured the land rights of the Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga nations would be protected by the U.S. government against state interference, was dishonored by the U.S. government. By the early 19th century, federal Indian agents were \\"deeply involved\\" in furthering a federal policy of depriving the Oneida people of their Article 2 rights to the quiet enjoyment of their treaty lands by both failing to prevent the state of New York from purchasing the treaty lands and actively \\"encouraging the removal of the Oneidas... to the west.\\" By 1920, the Oneida Nation retained only of treaty land down from the held before the American Revolution. The Oneida Nation of Wisconsin were still receiving an annuity check of $1,800, as late as 1941, almost 150 years after the treaty took effect. =Quakers= The Quakers were involved in the aftermath of the treaty. Pickering appointed the Quakers to teach the Haudenosaunee Confederacy ‚ÄúEuropean-style agriculture‚Äù. The Friends‚Äô Review, a Quaker publication, recalls ‚Äúploughs, axes, and hoes‚Äù being ‚Äúliberally‚Äù supplied to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.‚ÄúTHE SIX NATIONS.\\" (1852): Friends' Review; a Religious, Literary and Miscellaneos Journal (1847-1894) 5, no. 31: 484 The treaty has had a lasting legacy in asserting the sovereignty of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy; historian Robert W. Venables states that ‚Äúfrom 1794 to the present day, the treaty has been the legal keystones of relations between the United States and the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The treaty is at the center of any of the Six Nation‚Äôs land claims and their rights to govern their own reservations‚Äù. The sovereignty and autonomy established in the treaty was also reaffirmed in the State Papers of the London Review of 1796, stating that anyone is able to ‚Äúfreely to pass and repass‚Äù through the territory addressed in the treaty, while recognizing the friendship established by the treaty itself.\\"STATE PAPERS.\\" The European Magazine, and London Review 30, (08, 1796): 123 =Signatories= The treaty was signed by fifty Sachems and War Chiefs.

Although the pageant was usually broadcast live, that year's telecast was delayed due to a speech by then-President Bill Clinton regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. She also won the Clairol Herbal Essence Award that year. The pageant was won by Vanessa Minnillo of South Carolina. = Miss Massachusetts USA and Miss USA = Castillo in 2004 In November 2002, Castillo participated in the Miss Massachusetts USA Pageant held at Bridgewater State College in the town of Bridgewater, and won the title. Castillo was the state's first Latina titleholder. She went on to compete in the Miss USA 2003 pageant held in San Antonio on March 24, 2003. Castillo won the Miss USA title in the nationally televised event, becoming Massachusetts' second titleholder, and the fourth former Miss Teen USA state titleholder to win the pageant. She was the third Hispanic to win Miss USA after Laura Harring in 1985 and Lynnette Cole in 2000. In addition she was the first woman with Dominican ancestry to win the title as well as the second woman with Puerto Rican ancestry to win after Lynnette Cole. As Miss USA, Castillo represented the Miss Universe Organization, making appearances for charities throughout the United States. Her \\"sister\\" 2003 titleholders were Amelia Vega (Miss Universe, of the Dominican Republic) and Tami Farrell (Miss Teen USA, of Oregon). = Miss Universe = Castillo traveled to Panama City, Panama, to compete in the Miss Universe 2003 pageant in May. Her national costume was \\"Wonder Woman\\". Castillo placed among the 15 semifinalists. She placed 13th overall, like her placement at Miss Teen USA. The pageant was won by Amelia Vega of the Dominican Republic. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that two Dominican women or two Puerto Rican women participated in the pageant's history because the contestants that represented Italy (Denny Mendez) and the Dominican Republic in the 1997 edition were both of Dominican ancestry and the contestants the represented USA (Lynnette Cole) and Puerto Rico in the 2000 edition were both of Puerto Rican ancestry.

The Great Chrysanthemum is roughly the same size as the re-cut Kohinoor and almost three times the size of the Hope Diamond,Oakland Tribune. February 18, 1965 The Great Chrysanthemum has the dimensions of 39.10 x 24.98 x 16.00 mm. and features 67 facets on the crown, 57 facets on the pavilion and 65 vertical facets along the girdle. The diamond, designed as a pendant, became the central focus of a necklace with 410 oval, pear-shaped, round and marquis diamonds. The Great Chrysanthemum, considered one of the most famous diamonds in the world is the 2nd largest pear-shaped brown diamond and the 5th largest of all Fancy brown diamonds in the world. History The Great Chrysanthemum Diamond was discovered in 1963 at the Kimberley Mines in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. Weighing in at 198 carats, the rough diamond is one of about only 300 diamonds in the entire world which weigh in excess of a hundred carats. Julius Cohen, one-time prot√©g√© of Harry Winston and custodian of the Hope Diamond, purchased the rough stone from its original owners, saving it from the fate of being cut in two. It was Cohen who christened the stone the Great Chrysanthemum, after attending the Chrysanthemum Ball in San Antonio, Texas. When Cohen later learned through Ms. Craggett, his assistant, that the word Chrysanthemum meant \\"gold flower\\" in Greek, Cohen made it official. Under the direction of Cohen, the Great Chrysanthemum was later cut and crafted by S & M Kaufmann of New York. Cohen fashioned the fancy, rich golden-brown stone into a pear-shaped, faceted diamond. A letter dated October 15, 1973 to Julius Cohen from Paul E. Desautels, curator of the Division of Mineralogy of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, expressed the desire to acquire the Great Chrysanthemum for its, at the time, 15 year old national gem collection. In the letter, Desautels promises that the Great Chrysanthemum would be in good company alongside the famous Hope Diamond, the Portuguese Diamond, and the Eug√©nie Blue. Cohen eventually brought the Great Chrysanthemum to the Smithsonian for display and attaching it briefly alongside the Hope Diamond. The Great Chrysanthemum has been shown in a number of diamond exhibits throughout the United States. In 1965, the Chrysanthemum was named a winner of one of the Diamonds International Awards and was placed on display in the Rand Easter Festival in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was one of five featured stones brought out to celebrate the 100th year of discovery of diamonds in the famous Kimberley mines. Julius Cohen initially sold the diamond to an unknown buyer. The diamond returned to the world stage in 2003 when the jeweler to the English royal family, Garrards, purchased the stone. The Great Chrysanthemum was featured prominently in Garrards 2007 catalogue that also featured Princess Diana's heirloom engagement ring.Garrard Catalogue (London Jewellers Catalogue 2007) Since then, it has gone on display once again, most notably in recent years by such high profile personalities as filmmaker and former First Lady of San Francisco, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who wore the diamond to a ‚ÄúWomen of Power‚Äù event in 2008.https://www.hamiltonjewelers.com/blog/2012/12/22/hamilton-series- tracking-down-the-world%E2%80%99s-most-infamous-diamonds-%E2%80%93-the-great- chrysanthemum-diamond/https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/S-F-first-lady- sparkles-with-borrowed-diamonds-3179229.php#photo-2315664 Garrads of London reportedly sold the Great Chrysanthemum to an foreign anonymous buyer.

After studying in France, he became a teacher in London, and at the same time maintained a consistently large output of works. In addition to landscapes, portraits and other paintings, some of them on an unusually large scale, he built up a reputation as an illustrator of books. In the mid-1950s, Minton found himself out of sympathy with the abstract trend that was then becoming fashionable, and felt increasingly sidelined. He suffered psychological problems, self-medicated with alcohol, and in 1957 died by suicide. Life and career =Early years= Minton was born in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, the second of three sons of Francis Minton, a solicitor, and his wife, Kate, n√©e Webb.Middleton, Michael. \\"Minton, (Francis) John (1917‚Äì1957)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, Oct 2006, accessed 16 May 2011 From 1925 to 1932, he was educated at Northcliff House, Bognor Regis, Sussex, and then from 1932 to 1935 at Reading School. He studied art at St John's Wood School of Art from 1935 to 1938.Bone, Stephen. \\"John Minton ‚Äì Artist of many talents,\\" The Manchester Guardian, 22 January 1957, p. 5 and was greatly influenced by his fellow student Michael Ayrton, who enthused him with the work of French neo-romantic painters. He spent eight months studying in France, frequently accompanied by Ayrton, and returned from Paris when the Second World War began. In October 1939 Minton registered as a conscientious objector, but in 1941 changed his views and joined the Pioneer Corps. He was commissioned in 1943, but was discharged on medical grounds in the same year. While in the army, Minton, with Ayrton, designed the costumes and scenery for John Gielgud's 1942 production of Macbeth. The settings moved the piece from the 11th century to \\"the age of illuminated missals\\";\\"Macbeth\\", The Times, 9 July 1942, p. 6 The Manchester Guardian wrote that they \\"should be long remembered\\". In the same year he and Ayrton held a joint exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. The Times wrote, \\"Mr. Minton is seen to have an overcast, gloomy realism, and much intensity of feeling, which he expresses in dark colour schemes, both in a curious and effective self-portrait and in paintings of streets and bombed buildings.\\"\\"Young Artists ‚Äì Exhibition at Leicester Galleries\\", The Times, 16 October 1942, p. 6 Minton's early penchant for dark colour schemes can be seen in his 1939 Landscape at Les Baux, in the Tate Gallery.\\"Landscape at Les Baux\\", Tate Collection, accessed 25 November 2014. =Teacher, painter and illustrator= From 1943 to 1946 Minton taught illustration at the Camberwell College of Arts, and from 1946 to 1948 he was in charge of drawing and illustration at the Central School of Art and Design.\\"Mr. John Minton ‚Äì The lyrical touch,\\" The Times, 22 January 1957, p. 12 At the same time he continued to draw and paint, sharing a studio for some years with Robert Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde, and later with Keith Vaughan. Reviewing a 1944 exhibition, The Times remarked that Minton was clearly in the tradition of Samuel Palmer,\\"Art Exhibitions ‚Äì Early Calm and Modern Unrest\\", The Times, 25 October 1944, p. 6 something frequently remarked on by later critics. Minton's output was considerable. Between 1945 and 1956 he had seven solo exhibitions at the Lefevre Gallery, notwithstanding his work as tutor to the painting school of the Royal College of Art in 1949, a post that he held until the year before his death. Minton's appearance in this period is shown in a 1952 portrait by Lucian Freud, as well as in self-portraits. Minton's range was wide. Although he is best remembered as an illustrator, he also worked on a very large scale, with unusually big paintings for the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain and \\"two vast set-pieces\\" for the Royal College of Art, and at the Royal Academy a huge painting of the soldiers dicing for the garment of Jesus, described by The Manchester Guardian as \\"one of the most elaborate and serious paintings with a religious theme produced since the war.\\" He designed textiles and wallpapers; he produced posters for London Transport and Ealing Studios; and he was highly regarded as a portrait painter. He also worked in collage. He painted scenes of Britain, from rural beauty to urban decay, and travelled overseas, producing scenes of the West Indies, Spain and Morocco. The Times wrote, \\"Even when they were ostensibly of Spain and Jamaica, Minton's landscapes looked back to Samuel Palmer for their mood. They were densely patterned and luxuriantly coloured, and it was always the fullness and richness of the scene which attracted his eye and which he painted with such evident enjoyment.\\" Minton's posthumous fame is principally as an illustrator. Many of his commissions for illustrations came from the publisher John Lehmann. Both men were homosexual, and they were so much in one another's company that some people supposed that they were partners, though the biographer Artemis Cooper thinks it unlikely.Cooper, p. 152 For Lehmann, Minton illustrated A Book of Mediterranean Food and French Country Cooking (the first two books by the food writer Elizabeth David), travel books such as Time was Away ‚Äì A Notebook in Corsica, by Alan Ross, and fiction, including Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. He also produced dustwrappers for many publishers including Michael Joseph, Secker and Warburg and Rupert Hart- Davis. Although Minton was respected both by the conservative Royal Academy and the modernist London Group, he was out of sympathy with the abstract painting that began to prevail during the 1950s, and he felt increasingly out of touch with current fashion. He suffered extreme mood swings and became dependent on alcohol. He took his own life in 1957 at his London home, taking an overdose of sleeping tablets. A major exhibition to mark Minton's centenary took place at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester from 1 July to 1 October 2017, co-curated by the Gallery's Director Simon Martin and Minton's biographer Frances Spalding, and is the first exhibition in a museum since the 1994 touring Select Retrospective.http://pallant.org.uk/exhibitions/forthcoming-exhibitions/main- galleries/minton/minton Minton was the subject of the song, The Ghost of Mr Minton, released by London-based pop group Would-Be-Goods, on their 2008 album Eventyr. A quote from Minton, \\"We're all awash in a sea of blood, and the least we can do is wave to each other\\" inspired the title of the Van der Graaf Generator album The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other.

The historian of ideas Arthur Lovejoy was the first to trace the history of this philosophically important principle explicitly. Lovejoy distinguishes two versions of the principle: a static version, in which the universe displays a constant fullness and diversity, and a temporalized version, in which fullness and diversity gradually increase over time. Lovejoy traces the principle of plenitude to the writings of Plato, finding in the Timaeus an insistence on \\"the necessarily complete translation of all the ideal possibilities into actuality\\".Lovejoy 1936, p. 50. By contrast, he takes Aristotle to reject the principle in his Metaphysics, when he writes that \\"it is not necessary that everything that is possible should exist in actuality\\".Lovejoy 1936, p. 55. Since Plato, the principle of plenitude has had the following adherents: *Epicurus reiterated the principle in fr.266 Us. His follower Lucretius (DRN V 526-33 ) famously applied the principle to the sets of multiple explanations by which the Epicureans account for astronomical and meteorological phenomena: every possible explanation is also true, if not in our world, then elsewhere in the infinite universe. *Augustine of Hippo brought the principle from Neo-Platonic thought into early Christian Theology. *St Anselm's ontological arguments for God's existence used the principle's implication that nature will become as complete as it possibly can be, to argue that existence is a \\"perfection\\" in the sense of a completeness or fullness. *Thomas Aquinas accepted a modified form of the principle, but qualified it by making several distinctions that safeguard the freedom of God. *Giordano Bruno's insistence on an infinity of worlds was not based on the theories of Copernicus, or on observation, but on the principle applied to God. His death may then be attributed to his conviction of its truth. *Spinoza, according to Lovejoy, \\"expressed the principle of plenitude in its most uncompromising form\\" and \\"represented it as necessary in the strict logical sense\\".Lovejoy 1936, p. 155. *Kant believed in the principle but not in the possibility of its empirical verification. * Leibniz believed that the best of all possible worlds would actualize every genuine possibility.

They are a subrange of the Klamath Mountains and located to the north of Weaverville. Geography The Trinity Alps are within the Pacific Coast Ranges physiographic region, in the Klamath Mountains System, which lies between the California Coast Ranges to the west and the Cascade Range to the east. Elevations range from to on Thompson Peak. Other notable peaks include Granite Peak () and Ycatapom Peak (). The Trinity Alps are noted for their scenic views and alpine environment. The range's alpine flora differs from that found in the Sierra Nevada or the Cascades. Within the Klamath Mountains, adjacent subranges of the Trinity Alps include the Salmon Mountains and Scott Mountains. The Trinity Alps Wilderness covers , making it the second largest wilderness area in California. The area was formerly known as the Salmon-Trinity Alps Primitive Area since 1932 until a series of expansions. Glaciers, snowfields, and ice fields The lowest snowfield in California that does not disappear except in the extreme runs of dry years is located above Mirror Lake at an elevation of . The only unambiguous glacier is the icefield on the north side of Thompson Peak, which shows crevasses indicating true motion even on so small an icefield. Research has shown that some glaciers in the Trinity Alps are more resistant to the effects of global warming than are other California glaciers. According to recent, but incorrect, USGS maps, 35 permanent bodies of snow and several tiny glaciers dot the highest peaks of the Alps. =Temporary glacier= On the ridge south of Sapphire Lake is an unusual phenomenon consisting of a temporary glacier, versus an inactive snowfield that melts out in dry years. Following years of heavy accumulation, an icefield appears in this fully sheltered north-facing cirque that can show active crevasses and seracs some tens of feet high. But this ice body, at an elevation of only in a region experiencing a long, hot dry season from about mid May to mid October, can disappear completely during a run of drier years. Studies of lichen collars indicate that the site near Kalmia Lake is the snowiest spot in the State of California, receiving snow accumulation in excess of the Lake Helen snowcourse on Lassen Peak, by far the snowcourse with greatest late winter snow accumulation in California. This in turn is consistent with the fact of an active glacier under Thompson Peak, while, in contrast, no such active glacier exists under Brokeoff Mountain west of Lassen Peak, higher than Thompson Peak and presenting an ideal NNE-facing zone in the area of maximum snow accumulation beneath an almost-vertical cliff face high. Sufficient snow does accumulate under Brokeoff that in some years the snowfield there experiences incipient glacial motion. Two moraines below it, one very recent, provide clear evidence at least of mass transport in the recent past at that site. These moraines are quite a bit smaller than those found below the Thompson Peak glacieret. Natural history =Flora= The Trinity Alps section of the Klamath Mountains Ecoregion is botanically outstanding by having the second greatest number of conifer species of any place in the world. Russian Peak, in the Russian Wilderness just north of the Trinity Alps, has the greatest number of conifer species in North America.Munz, P. A. & D. Lake. Introduction to California Mountain Wildflowers. So many genera and species of conifers exist together because the Trinity Alps are at the intersection of the Mediterranean climate of the south and the Northwestern coastal climate, which has a shorter dry season. Northern tree species, such as subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) are found here, as well as southern trees, such as incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and white fir (Abies concolor), plus unique populations of foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana) and weeping spruce (Picea breweriana). Other plants along the trails include the carnivorous California pitcher plant (Darlingtonia californica), the showy pinkish Lewisia cotyledon, and the rare Trinity Alps endemic wildflower Trinity penstemon (Penstemon tracyi). Sagebrush is found on ridges in the Scott Mountains. Large fires have burned through some of the forests in the wilderness, including much of the Iron/Alps Complex fire in 2008. =Fauna= Most of the lakes have been stocked with rainbow, brown or brook trout, and some have self-sustaining populations. The major streams of the North Fork Trinity River and New River watersheds have spawning chinook salmon, and some have steelhead. The Trinity Alps are home to much wildlife, including: American black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, blacktailed deer, lizards, chipmunks, and a great number of bird species. Deer and black bear are commonly seen. Less common but present are mountain lion, pine marten, fisher, and wolverine. Rough-skinned newts are commonly found in ponds and lakes. The Trinity Alps may be home to a cryptozoological phenomenon, the Trinity Alps Giant Salamander. =Geology= Geologically, the Trinity Alps consist of a mixture of igneous, granite and metamorphic peaks. In the eastern mountains are the Red Trinities, due to reddish ultramafic peridotite, in the central granitic batholith are the White Trinities, and in the western mountains are the Green Trinities due to more extensive forest cover. The region contains much pine and fir forest as well as meadows, creeks, and lakes. Swift Creek viewed from footbridge in July 2005 Recreation The US Forest Service, Shasta-Trinity National Forest, manages most of the Trinity Alps Wilderness. The northern boundary extends into the Klamath National Forest, and the western boundary extends into the Six Rivers National Forest. There are also private inholdings, especially in the eastern portions. The wilderness contains hiking trails, backcountry camping, and scenery. Access is off California State Route 299 on the south, CA Route 3 on the east, and various old logging and mining roads on the north and west. Wilderness permits are required for hiking.Shasta-Trinity National Forest: Trinity Alps Wilderness FAQs The Pacific Crest Trail connects the northeast corner of the Trinity Alps to the Russian Wilderness and Marble Mountain Wilderness to the north and the Castle Crags Wilderness in the Trinity Divide to the east. Less-visited areas include New River, Salmon Mountain, Horse Linto Creek, Pony Buttes, and Limestone Ridge in the west, and Packers Peak, Deadman Peak, and Eagle Peak in the Scott Mountains. Most of the area is visited much less heavily than many other wilderness areas in California, such as in the High Sierra of Yosemite National Park and Kings Canyon National Park, but more heavily than the nearby Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness. Canyon Creek Lakes The most popular destinations beyond the trailheads are Canyon Creek Lakes, Emerald and Sapphire Lakes on the Stuart Fork, and Granite Lake on the Swift Creek trail. The western ridges are mostly lower in elevation with fewer lakes, and ridgetop trails there can be hot and dry in the summer. Trails do not reach all of the lakes; cross-country routes are possible. The Trinity Alps overlook Trinity Lake to the east, a large reservoir of the federal Central Valley Project on the Trinity River. Hunting occurs for deer, bear, and bandtailed pigeon in season. Rock climbing is excellent in the areas with granite cliffs, such as Caribou Peak and Sawtooth Ridge.

The cover features Vince Carter as a member of the Toronto Raptors and in Spain copies of NBA Live 2004 feature Raul Lopez. The game was developed by EA Sports and released in 2003. The game is similar graphically to NCAA March Madness 2004 and has the same create-a-player models. It was also the last game to feature Michael Jordan. Game modes = Season = Season mode play allows the player to choose an NBA team to compete for the season trophy. Players can also choose how many games there are during the season. A custom player option also allows game players to create their own team of NBA players. There is also a Roster management where game players can buy and sell players from various teams in the NBA. = Dynasty = Dynasty mode is similar to season mode but instead, teams compete for the Dynasty trophy. In this mode however, points earned from gameplay in games can be spent on individual and team training sessions to improve the skill level of the player's team. Points can also be spent in the 'NBA store' on shoes, jerseys, headbands, and socks. These clothing items can then be applied to the players of the team and are seen during gameplay. One of the main goals of Dynasty mode is the process of drafting and developing new players. = One on one = In this mode players go one on one with an opponent in either a gym or street court; they can edit the number of baskets to win the game. =Training= In this mode, the game player can practice and improve court skills. Features The new button layout now allows the player to choose when to shoot and when to dunk/layup. The new system improves on previous frustrations with 3 foot jumpers and losing possessions because of unnecessary dunk attempts. The \\"pro hop\\" has finally been introduced into the game and with it the ability to split defenders, or throw an opposing defender off rhythm. Not to be outdone, big men were given the ability to \\"power dribble,\\" which creates space into the lane for an easier basket. Yet, with the newly improved defense and AI, coming by points is that much more difficult. In addition, freestyle dribbling is no longer an end-all to improving the game, and handling stats actually affect the player's ability to freestyle. Along with the game's new freestyle improvements, the game is bound to grab their attention. This was also the first game to feature the Charlotte Bobcats; they are the worst team in the game with a rating of 50. Since the game's rosters were finalized before the expansion draft, the Bobcats' lineup consisted of players named after their specific positions, for example, the point guard was named \\"Point Guard\\". Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Kuwait. Early posts The postal history of Kuwait begins around 1775, when the East India Company began an overland desert camel service from the head of the Persian Gulf to Aleppo and Constantinople as an alternative to slower sea travel around the Arabian Peninsula. This service operated until 1795. Treaty with the British A KUWAIT overprint on a 1934 4 Anna stamp of India.

After the treaty with the British in 1899, the consul's office handled mail, using stamps sent from Bushire, and forwarding mail to Bushire or putting it on passing ships. The first dedicated post office opened on 21 January 1915,Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Part 19 Middle East. 6th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2005, p.187. and used stamps of India. From 1 August 1921 to April 1941 the office was administered from nearby Basra in Iraq. From 1 April 1923, Indian stamp were issued with \\"KUWAIT\\" overprints; this practice continued for many years.\\"Indian Postal History 1947‚Äì1997\\" by Ashok Kumar Bayanwala at stampsofindia.com. Retrieved 8 February 2011. In 1941 the post office was temporarily closed for about a month because of the Anglo- French invasion of Iraq (during which time mail was carried by diplomatic bag through London), then re-opened under Indian administration. Owing to wartime exigencies, the office used un-overprinted Indian stamps until 1945, when a new set of Indian stamps was overprinted. This phase came to an end with Indian independence; Kuwait was administered by Pakistan in 1947 and 1948, then by the British government directly from 1 April 1948.https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052516/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/asia/kuwait-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. Under British administration, British stamps were overprinted with values in annas and rupees. Unusually, the overprint was applied to all British stamps issued during this period, both regular and commemorative issues. In 1957, the currency was decimalised, 100 naye paise (np) to a rupee, which necessitated a fresh set of overprints. These were to be the last stamps issued by the British. Kuwaiti control In anticipation of their coming independence, the Kuwaitis took over postal administration on 31 January 1959. A first set of Kuwaiti stamps had already gone into production, with 5np and 10np values depicting Sheik 'Abd Allah III al-Salim al-Sabah, and a 40np value showing a dhow, being used on local mail in 1958. The full set of 13 values went on sale 1 February 1959, and included additional scenes of oil-related activities. A 1961 30 fils stamp of Kuwait. Independence As part of independence in 1961, the government established the Kuwaiti dinar as its currency and reissued the 1959 stamps in the new values, also adding some new designs, for a total of 18 values, ranging from 1 fils to 3 dinars. Subsequently, Kuwaiti stamp issues followed a pattern typical of many Arab countries, with designs tending to incorporate a fair amount of text, in both English and Arabic. The usual inscription reads \\"STATE OF KUWAIT\\". Definitive series included a natural-color portrait framed in silver in 1964, a portrait of Sheik Sabah in 1969, and a 32-stamp series in 1977 depicting popular games. Kuwaiti issues came to an abrupt end with the 1990 invasion by Iraq. Iraqi stamps were used in the country until early 1991, at which point the regular Kuwaiti stamp program resumed.

Background According to KMFDM frontman Sascha Konietzko, the song made its debut during KMFDM's 1990 tour with industrial metal band Ministry, being based on the lyrics by Patti Smith. When Koneitzko's bandmate En Esch, who had been singing the song live, was injured during a fire, Konietzko had to use new lyrics, as he didn't know the original words. He translated a German spoken word piece the band had been using at their live shows into English, and used the translation as the new lyrics. After the tour, the band recorded a version for their album Na√Øve with a group of performers from other Wax Trax! Records bands. Later, Konietzko re-recorded a more electronic version for the single. The track heavily features a sampled guitar riff from \\"Angel of Death\\" by Californian thrash metal band Slayer. This sample is looped from the beginning of \\"Godlike\\" and is heard almost continuously throughout the track.

It was first released on the British version of the band's 1965 album Rubber Soul; it also appeared in North America on the Yesterday and Today collection. The upbeat, lighthearted \\"Drive My Car\\" was used as the opening track for both albums. Lyrics The song's male narrator is told by a woman that she is going to be a famous movie star, and she offers him the opportunity to be her chauffeur, adding: \\"and maybe I'll love you\\". When he objects that his \\"prospects [are] good\\", she retorts, \\"Working for peanuts is all very fine/But I can show you a better time.\\" When he agrees to her proposal, she admits, \\"I got no car and it's breakin' my heart/But I've found a driver and that's a start.\\" According to McCartney, \\"'Drive my car' was an old blues euphemism for sex\\". This expression was more common in the pre-automatic shift era of automobiles. Composition When McCartney arrived at Lennon's Weybridge home for a writing session, he had the tune in his head, but \\"the lyrics were disastrous, and I knew it.\\" The chorus began, \\"You can buy me diamond rings\\", a clich√© they had used twice before, in \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Feel Fine\\" (as well as in the discarded \\"If You've Got Trouble\\"). Lennon dismissed the lyrics as \\"crap\\" and \\"too soft\\". They decided to rewrite the lyrics and after some difficulty ‚Äì McCartney said it was \\"one of the stickiest\\" writing sessions ‚Äì they settled on the \\"drive my car\\" theme (which Bob Spitz credits to Lennon) and the rest of the lyrics flowed easily from that. It has been suggested that the song also refers to the relationship between Cilla Black and her then boyfriend Bobby Willis (whom she later married). Black was both a friend of the Beatles and a proteg√©e of Brian Epstein. As the TV mini-series Cilla revealed, Willis was also offered a recording contract by Epstein, but Black objected, saying that she was the \\"star\\" and Willis was to be the road manager who would \\"drive my car\\". Recording \\"Drive My Car\\" was recorded on 13 October 1965 during the Beatles' first recording session to extend past midnight. McCartney worked closely with George Harrison on the basic rhythm track, the pair playing, in author Ian MacDonald's description, \\"similar riffing lines on bass and low guitar\\", respectively, as per Harrison's suggestion. Harrison had been listening to Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\" at the time and, as a result of this influence, \\"Drive My Car\\" contains more bottom end than previous Beatles recordings, mimicking the bass-heavy sound captured in Redding's Memphis studio. Author Robert Rodriguez describes the track as an \\"overt R&B; workout\\" and a rare example of the Beatles demonstrating their admiration of Stax and Motown artists on the mostly folk rock-oriented Rubber Soul. McCartney sang the main vocal part, giving it an energetic push that journalist Richie Unterberger calls \\"a commanding... hard rock vocal\\". The vocal rides above a simple two-chord funk riff in the verse, and a much more complex chorus containing piano-driven jazz-style key modulations. McCartney overdubbed both the piano part and the slide guitar solo. The song opens with a bluesy riff played on two electric guitars, before the bass enters. This opening section was also overdubbed onto the basic track. According to musicologist Walter Everett, it provides an ametrical and \\"off-balance\\" introduction, \\"with its blue notes presaging what is to come\\".

He is most well known as the author of the novel Once Were Warriors (1990), which was made into a film of the same name in 1994.  Biography  Alan Duff was born in Rotorua, the son of forestry scientist Gowan Duff (1910‚Äì1995), known as Pat, and Hinau Josephine Duff (n√©e Raimona), known as Kuia, of NgƒÅti Rangitihi and NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa descent, and grandson of writer Oliver Duff. He was born and raised in a State housing area in Rotorua, New Zealand. Oliver Duff (1883‚Äì1967) was a writer and foundation editor of the New Zealand Listener, and Duff inherited his grandfather's love of literature. Duff's parents separated when he was 10, and Duff moved in with a MƒÅori uncle and aunt at Whakarewarewa. He wrote at some length about his troubled childhood in his 1999 memoir, Out of the Mist and the Steam. Many of these experiences informed his writing of his novel Once Were Warriors. Duff was expelled from his school Rotorua Boys' High School and ran away from home, ending up as a State ward at Hamilton Boys‚Äô Home. Later he lived with another uncle, anthropologist Roger Duff, and went back to school at Christchurch Boys' High School. At 15 he was sentenced to a term in Waikeria Borstal for assault and breaking and entering. After leaving school, Duff worked as an installer of sheet metal insulation and sang in a band. He had a partner, with whom he had two children. In the late 1970s, Duff lived in England. While there he initially worked as an installer of sheet metal insulation, then as a barman & bar manager. However, he then again migrated to a criminal life, and in 1979 was sentenced to 19 months in jail. While in England, Duff had a partner, Paula and daughter, Katea. In September 2007 he was arrested while speeding near Taupo. On 30 March 2008 he appeared in the Taupo District Court at a defended hearing and was represented by prominent barrister Antony Shaw. Duff pled not guilty to failing to remain at a scene after being stopped, failing to stop for police and two charges of resisting police. He was also allegedly abusive and very uncooperative. During the alleged incident, he was stopped and then took off, after a pursuit he allegedly swung a policewoman around by the handcuffs as she was attempting to restrain him. The charges were later dismissed by the Taupo District Court, Judge McGuire saying: \\"the result however, is that I am left uneasy over whether police prosecutorial power was used wisely and fairly in this instance...\\". However a high court judge subsequently ruled that the judge erred and police could detain a driver while carrying out checks, although he did not require that the charges be relaid. On 16 June 2011 Alan Duff declared himself bankrupt, owing creditors $3.6 million NZD. As of March 2013 he was living in France but still visiting New Zealand several times a year. Writing Duff began to write full-time in 1985. He tried writing a thriller as his first novel, but it was rejected. He burned the manuscript and started writing Once Were Warriors (1990), which had an immediate and great impact. The novel is written in juxtaposed interior monologues, making its style stand out from other works. It was winner of the PEN Best First Book Award, was runner-up in the Goodman Fielder Wattie Award, and was made into the award-winning film of the same name in 1994. One Night Out Stealing, appeared in 1991 and was shortlisted in the 1992 Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards. Duff was awarded the Frank Sargeson Fellowship in 1991, and began writing a weekly‚Äîlater bi-weekly ‚Äì column for The Evening Post, syndicated to eight other newspapers. In this, and in his 1993 analysis, MƒÅori: The Crisis and the Challenge, he has developed his ideas on the failures of MƒÅoridom, castigating both the traditional leadership and the radical movement for dwelling on the injustices of the past and expecting others to resolve them, instead of encouraging MƒÅori to get on and help themselves. The blame for MƒÅori underperformance he puts squarely back on MƒÅori, for not making the most of the opportunities given them. State Ward started as a series of episodes on radio in 1993 and was published as a novella in 1994. In the 1995 New Year Honours, Duff was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature. The Duffy Books in Homes scheme, co-founded in 1995 by Duff and Christine Fernyhough, with commercial sponsorship and government support, aims to alleviate poverty and illiteracy by providing low-cost books to underprivileged children, thus encouraging them to read. In its first year alone it put about 180,000 new books in the hands of about 38,000 children. By 2008, the scheme delivered 5 million books to schools around New Zealand. What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? (1996), the sequel to Once Were Warriors, was the winner of the fiction section of the 1997 Montana Book Awards and was also made into a film What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? in 1999. Two Sides of the Moon was published in 1998. Duff wrote his own memoir, Out of the Mist and the Steam, in 1999. His first novel to be set outside of New Zealand is Szabad (2001). Inspired by the stories of people Duff met during his several trips to Hungary, the story takes place in Budapest during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Jake's Long Shadow (2002) is the third volume in Duff's Once Were Warriors trilogy. In 2003 Once Were Warriors was brought to the stage across New Zealand as a musical drama. In 2000, Duff released a book called Alan Duff's Maori heroes (). In 2009, Duff released his new book Who Sings for Lu? In 2019, Duff released A Conversation with my Country (). Duff regularly writes for the New Zealand Herald.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/Alan- Duff/news/headlines.cfm?a_id=977 References External links *Interview with Alan Duff *Alan Duff's Once Were Warriors -- Social and Political Contexts *Literary Encyclopedia * 1950 births Living people New Zealand MƒÅori writers New Zealand writers People from Rotorua People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School NgƒÅti Rangitihi NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa New Zealand Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Alan Duff"},{"id":"1789018","text":"Mac MacLeod (born Keith MacLeod, 9 July 1941, St Albans, Hertfordshire) is an English musician who was a part of the Hertfordshire folk and blues scene from 1959 onwards.

He often played with other musicians of note: the flat picking Mick Softley and school friend Maddy Prior. In the summer time MacLeod travelled to the South West where he made friends with John Renbourn. The two busked together from around 1961 to 1964. In 1964 MacLeod and Renbourn recorded three demos together; 'South Coast', 'Cocaine' and 'Train Blues'. Donovan was influenced from 1961 onwards by MacLeod's finger picking and the flat pick styles made popular by Ramblin' Jack Elliott which had been a big inspiration on Mick Softley and 'Dirty Hugh'. MacLeod taught Donovan claw hammer style and finger pick techniques (see Hurdy Gurdy) and many songs from his folk blues heroes. Donovan said in an interview for Beat Instrumental in May 1965 titled 'Donovan's Big Influence? It's Not Dylan!' \\"The man who encouraged and helped me most was a fellow called Keith 'Mac' MacLeod. I've known him for about three years, and he's taught me everything from chord progressions on the guitar, to how to appreciate folk and real blues\\". In the summer of 1964 MacLeod was back in Torquay, this time Donovan joined him for his final summer before fame came knocking. MacLeod joined Donovan's first national tour of Britain which kicked off at the NME poll winners' party on 11 April 1965. Donovan's set has been called the first folk-rock gig by music writer Richie Unterberger. One of the tour dates saw Donovan and MacLeod playing on stage with Joan Baez. After Donovan's first UK tour MacLeod teamed up first with Dana Gillespie then with another regular on the St Albans music scene, Maddy Prior, to form Mac & Maddy. A demo tape of Mac & Maddy was made but has subsequently been lost. Donovan has since the early 1990s changed his stories as regards MacLeod's influence, naming 'Dirty Hugh' or 'Dirty Phil' as his finger picking teacher and John Vanstone as his early guitar mentor, removing MacLeod's name from the story. However, no interviews with him from the 1960s mention either 'Dirty Hugh', 'Dirty Phil' or John Vanstone. A guitarist called 'Dirty Hugh' (so called because he dressed in rags) played at 'The Cock', but he could only strum and flat pick the guitar, he could not finger pick and therefore was unable to teach Donovan that art. Donovan's first two albums included many songs that he learnt from MacLeod as revealed in Pete Frames ZigZag Wanderer No.5 March 1999 and in the Nigel Cross interviews for Terrascope =Sweden, Denmark and back again= MacLeod's odyssey was to take him around Britain, and across Sweden and Denmark. The anthology Mac MacLeod ‚Äì The Incredible Musical Odyssey of the Original Hurdy Gurdy Man on RPM/Cherry Red Records contains many rare recordings, from the acoustic folksy beginnings through a succession of one-off groups like The Other Side (with Boz Scaggs) and Exploding Mushroom, to the Hurdy Gurdy (with producers Rod Argent and Chris White). The group became an underground favourite and went on to headline at Middle Earth, supporting Pink Floyd at the same venue. =Hurdy Gurdy= MacLeod was the lead singer and bassist in a power trio style group in Denmark (inspired by Cream) which he named Hurdy Gurdy. The group sound was heading in a similar direction to The Jimi Hendrix Experience who had also started at around the same time. After a run-in with the law, MacLeod had written to Donovan's manager, Ashley Kozak, in December 1967 and asked if he could help. Donovan then penned them a song and \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" was the result. However, Donovan changed his mind on his gift of the song to MacLeod and recorded it himself. Donovan explained the story to Keith Altham of the NME on 15 June 1968 (a different version of the article appeared in Hit Parader December 1968, but also with the MacLeod link being mentioned): In addition to the above article, Donovan also confirmed the genesis of the \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" song to Melody Maker in July 1968, during an interview with Tony Wilson. Donovan had written the song before going to India with The Beatles, and handed a demo tape to MacLeod to work from; he had originally wanted the song to be gentle and angelic but what Hurdy Gurdy played was more like heavy metal. It was during this time in India that Donovan taught John Lennon and Paul McCartney the fingerpicking styles he had learned from MacLeod; this resulted in songs like \\"Julia\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" being recorded for the so-called White Album (The Beatles). Donovan has also stated that George Harrison added an extra verse to the \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" song while they were in India. MacLeod encountered problems with work permits for the Danish members of the group during their stay in England, so the other members went back to Denmark, still under the name Hurdy Gurdy, and recorded an album for CBS Records. =From Skye to Soft Cloud= After the demise of Hurdy Gurdy, MacLeod recorded with the post-The Zombies: Argent whose song \\"Telescope\\" was a lost classic until released on MacLeod's Anthology. Macleod also played bass on two other Argent tracks, \\"To Julia\\" and \\"Girl Help Me\\". At the end of the 1960s MacLeod was reunited with Donovan who whisked him off, with a group of other old friends, to the Isle of Skye. MacLeod was asked to be a sideman once more for Donovan's US tour with Candy Carr, which was to be the prototype 'Open Road' band. After several weeks of rehearsals all was well acoustically, however when the band went electric it did not work out as well as Donovan hoped. Rather than rehearse the new electric approach, Donovan had a change of heart and went to the U.S. alone. MacLeod returned to St Albans and formed Soft Cloud-Loud Earth with Mick Softley, 'Candy' John Carr (who also went to Skye for Donovan's U.S. tour line-up) and Mike Thomson. Due to the erratic behaviour of Softley, Carr and Thomson jumped ship and soon formed Open Road with Donovan, leaving MacLeod to continue with Softley in the duo Soft Cloud. After Soft Cloud had evaporated MacLeod formed a new band, the sitar-drenched Amber with Julian McAllister and Ray Cooper. Amber had some tracks produced by former The Yardbirds singer Keith Relf. =Silverlining= After many years out of the music industry MacLeod returned with a new band Silverlining in 1999. He continues to play live both solo and with a full band line-up (sometimes including his old school friend The Kinks' and The Zombies' bassist Jim Rodford) and he is making plans for a forthcoming album. He has also added flute to the new St Albans band Maya on their new album Revelations, and supplied some guitar for the band The Coming. Pete Frame, author of Rock Family trees, has also written a special edition of Zigzag Wanderer entitled 'Catching Dreams From the Clouds' all about MacLeod's early days. =Recently= MacLeod has been in communication with Donovan, first when he co-nominated him for his Honorary Doctorate at the University of Hertfordshire in November 2003. and later Donovan's birthday on 10 May 2005 (where he met up with old friend Gyp Mills) where MacLeod was a special guest. On 9 June that year Donovan and MacLeod played together again on stage at Oxford ; the last time they played onstage together was during Donovan's first UK tour in 1965. MacLeod has a new more acoustic based album in the works. MacLeod had a recent reunion with his old Amber partner Julian McAllister and he is also in touch with his old friends John Renbourn and Maddy Prior.

He was born in Couvet in Neuch√¢tel (now Switzerland) in 1714 and died in 1767. He was largely influenced by Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius. He is most famous for his 1758 work The Law of Nations. This work was his claim to fame and won him enough prestige to be appointed as a councilor to the court of Frederick Augustus II of Saxony. Early life and career The son of a Protestant minister, Vattel was born at Couvet, Neuch√¢tel, on the 25th of April 1714. He studied at Basel and Geneva. During his early years his favorite pursuit was philosophy and, having carefully studied the works of Leibniz and Christian Wolff, he published in 1741 a defence of Leibniz's system against Jean-Pierre de Crousaz. In the same year Vattel, who was born a subject of the king of Prussia, repaired to Berlin in the hope of obtaining some public employment from Frederick II, but was disappointed in his expectation. Two years later he proceeded to Dresden, where he experienced a very favourable reception from Count Br√ºhl, the minister of Saxony. In 1746 he obtained from the elector, Augustus III, the title of councillor of embassy, accompanied with a pension, and was sent to Bern in the capacity of the elector's minister. His diplomatic functions did not occupy his whole time, and much of his leisure was devoted to literature and jurisprudence. The Law of Nations Le droit des gens, 1775. The cover page from The Law of Nations Vattel's masterpiece was largely influenced by a book titled Jus Gentium Methodo Scientifica Pertractum (The Law of Nations According to the Scientific Method) by Wolff. Vattel's work began, in fact, by translating Wolff's text from Latin, and adding his own thoughts. Vattel's work was also heavily influenced by Leibniz and Hugo Grotius. Focused largely on the rights and obligations of citizens and states, Vattel's work also had ramifications for Just War Theory as it outlined international diplomacy as we now know it. Vattel elucidated the \\"Golden Rule of Sovereigns\\": > One cannot complain when he is treated as he treats others. =English editions= Vattel's Law of Nations was translated into English in 1760, based on the French original of 1758. A Dublin translation of 1787 does not include notes from the original nor posthumous notes added to the 1773 French edition. Several other English editions were based on the edition of 1760. However, an English edition from 1793 includes Vattel's later thoughts, as did the London 1797 edition. The 1797 edition has a detailed table of contents and margin titles for subsections. =Benjamin Franklin= Charles W.F. Dumas sent Benjamin Franklin three original French copies of de Vattel's Le droit des gens (The Law of Nations). Franklin presented one copy to the Library Company of Philadelphia. On December 9, 1775, Franklin thanked Dumas: > It came to us in good season, when the circumstances of a rising State make > it necessary to frequently consult the Law of Nations. Franklin also said that this book by Vattel, \\"has been continually in the hands of the members of our Congress now sitting\\".U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm'n., 434 U.S. 452, 462 (1977). =George Washington= Two notable copies of The Law of Nations owned by the New York Society Library have been associated with US President George Washington. One copy had been borrowed by Washington on 8 October 1789, along with a copy of Vol. 12 of the Commons Debates, containing transcripts from Great Britain's House of Commons. When the staff of the Washington museum at Mount Vernon heard about the overdue books, they were unable to locate them, but purchased a second copy of the de Vattel work for US$12,000. This identical copy was ceremoniously \\"returned\\" 221 years late on 20 May 2010. The library waived the unpaid late- fees.\\"George Washington's 221-year overdue library book: A timeline\\", The Week, 21 May 2010, retrieved 3 May 2011 Other works Vattel also published works other than his magnum opus. He worked so intensely that his health broke down, and a return to Dresden in 1766 did not improve him. His last work, Questions de droit naturel, ou Observations sur le trait√© du droit de la nature, par Wolff (\\"Questions of natural rights...\\") was published in 1762 and concerned Wolff's natural law philosophy.Questions de droit naturel, et observations sur le Trait√© du droit de la nature de M. le baron de Wolf, A Berne : Chez la Societ√© typographique (1762) Internet Archive He died in 1767 during a visit to Neuch√¢tel. Influence Vattel was one of a number of 18th century European scholars who wrote on international law and were \\"well known in America\\" at the time, including Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui, Cornelius van Bynkershoek, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, Thomas Rutherforth, Niccolo Machiavelli, and Wolff. The Law of Nations has been described as \\"unrivaled among such treatises in its influence on the American founders\\".U.S. Department of State: Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State: America's Founders were inspired by the ideas and values of early Swiss philosophers like Jean- Jacques Burlamaqui and Emer de Vattel, and the 1848 Swiss Constitution was influenced by our own U.S. Constitution. Swiss commitment to democracy is an example for nations and people everywhere who yearn for greater freedoms and human rights Vattel is also cited extensively in Lysander Spooner's The Unconstitutionality Of Slavery and appears to be a key Enlightenment thinker in Spooner's thought.  US Department of Defense 2015 Law of War Manual In 2015 the United States Department of Defense published its Law of War Manual. Vattel is cited after Hugo Grotius and before Francis Lieber and Hersch Lauterpacht as a subsidiary means and an authority in determining the rules of law of war.

He was the author of the well-known Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica (Dictionary of historical-ecclesiastical learning).  Biography  He received his early education from the Brothers of the Christian Schools at Rome. Apprenticed later to a barber, his duties frequently took him to the Camaldolese Monastery of Saint Gregory the Great on the Coelian Hill. The prior there, Dom Mauro Cappellari, O.S.B. Cam., and several of the monks recognized his exceptional gifts, and made use of him in a quasi-secretarial capacity. When Cappellari became a cardinal he made Moroni his chamberlain, and when he became Pope Gregory XVI, he employed Moroni to serve as his First Assistant of the Chamber, employing him also as his private secretary. In that capacity Moroni personally wrote over 100,000 letters during his lifetime. Moroni also later served Pope Pius IX as an Assistant of the Chamber. Among the books of the monastery and of the cardinal, as well as from conversations with learned people, Moroni acquired a vast store of information. He also gradually collected a considerable private library bearing on ecclesiastical questions, while he made notes from daily papers and from other publications for his own instruction. The subsequent arrangement of these notes in order suggested to him the idea of turning his labours to the benefit of the public, an idea which he realized in the Dictionary, a mine of interesting data and authoritative in matters concerning the Pontifical Court, the organization of the Curia and the Church, and the administration of the Papal States. In matters of history, it depends on the writers whom its author consulted. It is, however, not a well-ordered or homogeneous work, but these defects may be readily forgiven in view of the fact that its author did his work alone, without real collaboration, and wrote at times sixteen hours a day. Moroni was also the author of official articles on papal ceremonies, the journeys of the popes, etc. During the conclaves of 1829 and 1831, he wrote the Giornale storico-politico-eremoniale delle sede vacante e il conclave per l'elezione di Pio VIII e Gregorio XVI, which, like others of his writings remained unpublished. As a member of the household of Pope Gregory XVI, Moroni was the object of much sectarian hatred. He was a friend of many cardinals, including Wiseman, and of other illustrious men. In the index of the Dictionary, he indicates the various passages of the work which speak of himself, and which thus constitute a kind of autobiography.

It makes use of various open-source projects at Apache such as XMLBeans. It leverages innovations in Java 5 which include JSR-175, which is a facility for annotating fields, methods and classes so that they can be treated in special ways by runtime tools. It builds on the framework developed for BEA Systems Weblogic Workshop for its 8.1 series. BEA later decided to donate the code to Apache. History Version 8.1 of BEA's Weblogic Workshop includes a number of significant enhancements to version 7.0. The previous version was more focused on creating industrial-strength web services quickly. However, 7.0 did not have many customers, and it failed to create a stir in the market. However, for version 8.1, BEA created a whole new IDE which helped programmers to develop Java EE-based applications more quickly. This was significantly better than 7.0 with more advanced features and also won several awards and gained a lot of critical acclaim. However, a new revolution was brewing in the Java universe in the form of Eclipse and it seemed like everyone was moving towards it. Although Workshop 8.1 did not succeed as much as it intended to, the Weblogic Workshop Framework which was developed for 8.1 version Workshop was recognized as a good solid framework. In order that it can be used with other Java EE-based application servers, BEA decided to open-source the project under the purview of the Apache Software Foundation. Latest version of Beehive was released in December 4, 2006; its lifetime has ended in January 2010, when it has been retired and moved to Apache Attic. Beehive components =Netui Page Flows= This is an application framework built on top of Apache Struts which allows easier tooling and automatic updating of the various Struts configuration files. =Controls= This is the heart of the Beehive framework. A control can be defined as a program which can be used by the developer to quickly gain access to enterprise-level resources such as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), web services etc. For example consider accessing an old legacy EJB 2 bean. It involved a lot of boiler-plate code like getting access to an home interface, then creating/finding an EJB using finder methods and then accessing the remote methods of the bean. Using a control simplified this because it did most of the boiler-plate or routine coding for the developer, who could then concentrate more on business logic rather than worrying about the inner-details of Java EE technology. If the developer was sufficiently advanced, even then it was useful because then the developer could concentrate on more useful things like constructing a Facade to a complex set of application APIs. In essence a control to a legacy EJB 2 bean ensured that the developer could simply use the control and call any business method of the EJB, using it in the same way as any other Java class. When EJB 3 came around, such simplification was already provided by the EJB specification itself,\\"This release made it much easier to write EJBs, using 'annotations' rather than the complex 'deployment descriptors' used in version 2.x. The use of home and remote interfaces and the ejb-jar.xml file were also no longer required...\\" EJBEJB 3 example\\"Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.0 is a deep overhaul and simplification of the EJB specification.\\" http://www.jboss.org/ejb3\\"... the heavyweight programming paradigm in EJB 2.x, the flawed persistence model in EJB 2.x entity beans...\\" \\"In our view, one of the most important changes in EJB 3.1 is the redefinition of EJBs as simple managed bean POJOs with additional services.\\" http://blog.caucho.com/?p=384 and Beehive controls were of little further use here.\\"... the EJB 3 client model has essentially standardized much of the value-add that the [Beehive] EJB control offered in terms of simplifying the EJB 2.1 client model\\" http://markmail.org/message/mh43akcleflzes3rAndre McCulloch, \\"OK, these are great points that lead me to believe that and [sic] EJB3 control does not provide much value add for Beehive right now.\\" http://markmail.org/message/ktec5f4gsbw22ijb The Controls come with a standard set of controls wiz EJB Control, Webservice Control, Database Control and JMS Control. Custom controls can also be developed which in turn could make use of the controls already built-in. =Webservices= This is the third component of Beehive and it enables a developer to create webservices using meta- data/annotations quickly. In essence by using meta-data/annotations one can create complex web services utilizing features like conversation, state etc quickly and since all the meta-data/annotations are in one file, it is easier to debug and maintain. Using this approach any plain Java class can be converted into a web service just by the addition of annotations into the Java source files. This is based on JSR-181 which builds on JSR-175.

During its history, it was known variously as Strategy Plus (October 1990, Issue 1) and Computer Games Strategy Plus, but changed its name to Computer Games Magazine after its purchase by theGlobe.com. By April 2007, it held the record for the second-longest-running print magazine dedicated exclusively to computer games, behind Computer Gaming World. In 1998 and 2000, it was the United States' third-largest magazine in this field. History The magazine's original editor-in-chief, Brian Walker, sold Strategy Plus to the United States retail chain Chips & Bits in 1991. Based in Vermont and owned by Tina and Yale Brozen, Chips & Bits retitled Strategy Plus to Computer Games Strategy Plus after the purchase. Its circulation rose to around 130,000 monthly copies by the mid-1990s. By 1998, Computer Games Strategy Plus was the United States' third-largest computer game magazine, with a circulation of 184,299. According to editor-in-chief Steve Bauman, this number rose to 220,000 in 1999. Chips & Bits was purchased by theGlobe.com in January 2000, alongside Computer Games Strategy Plus and its publishing division, Strategy Plus, Inc. By March 2000, Computer Games circulation had reached 240,000 copies; roughly 300,000 units of each issue were printed per month. It remained the United States' third-biggest computer game magazine by that date, according to Yale Brozen, and the publication's Ed Mitchell estimated that it was Vermont's largest magazine in any field. Its official website, cdmag.com, averaged one million unique visits per month by early 2000. The magazine experienced major growth during 2000: tracking firm BPA International recorded its average circulation from July-December as 374,576 copies, while the December issue rose to 450,515. Computer Games Magazine was subsequently redesigned, starting from its June 2001 issue. Computer Games Magazine launched a sister publication, MMO Games Magazine, in 2006. On March 13, 2007, both publications were shut down by theGlobe.com, after that company was hit with a multimillion-dollar judgement in a lawsuit resulting from the e-mail spam of MySpace.

This was followed with 1987's Still Lovin' You LP on the Cleopatra Records label, and 1988's Melbourne, Memphis and the Mansion in the Sky LP on the Agape label. The Slaughtermen gained a following playing revved up versions of southern gospel songs and barroom country classics at inner city rock venues in Sydney and Melbourne between 1985 and 1988. The band enjoyed a year's residency at the Rising Sun Hotel in Melbourne which built a fairly even following of believers and sceptics. Singer Stephen, only added to the mystique and/or confusion by purchasing a twenty five dollar Reverendship from a religious organization from out of the back pages of the National Enquirer. A nationally broadcast hour-long live concert on Australia's ABC TV, cemented their unique place to this day, as Australia's first and only southern gospel group ( perhaps Steve Messer's Strange Country come close but their material is fundamentally different), albeit twelve thousand miles from the original source of inspiration, America's Deep South. > \\"The Slaughtermen were, and still are, one of the most original bands ever > to see the light of day in Australia.\\" Mathew W. McPherson, Rolling Stone > Australia Pendlebury and Hefner left the band after the release of Melbourne, Memphis and a Mansion, and were replaced by Tony Thornton, (drums) and Martin Lubran (lead guitar and pedal steel). After a lacklustre Sydney tour in 1988 the band ceased performing and released Jesus Can't Remember in April 1989 as a 12\\" EP. Later in 1989, Stephen formed the Ian Stephen Band and released solo material. In 1994 The Slaughtermen reconvened for a series of performances in Melbourne, and released a CD, Gospel Gold, on the Massive label in 1995. This 20 track disc featured live recordings of their gospel material culled from the Live Naturally album and various sound board recordings. In 1997, 2007 and 2009 the original members reformed for one-off concerts in Melbourne. In May 2012 The Slaughtermen announced performances in Melbourne for the coming August. The Slaughtermen performed in August 2013 at the Caravan Club, Oakleigh, Victoria. Following the last song of the evening the band announced that it would no longer perform \\"Jesus Saves White Trash\\". The Slaughtermen performed twice in Sept 2014, in Melbourne, at Tago Mago in Thornbury and The Caravan Club in Oakleigh. The band once again revisited \\"Jesus Saves White Trash\\" due to many requests by the audience.

Rummikub is a tile-based game for 2 to 4 players, combining elements of the card game rummy and mahjong. There are 106 tiles in the game, including 104 numbered tiles (valued 1 to 13 in four different colors, two copies of each) and two jokers. Players have 14 or 16 tiles initially and take turns putting down tiles from their racks into sets (groups or runs) of at least three, drawing a tile if they cannot play. In the Sabra version (the most common and popular), the first player to use all their tiles scores a positive score based on the total of the other players' hands, while the losers get negative scores. An important feature of the game is that players can work with the tiles that have already been played. History Rummikub was invented by Ephraim Hertzano, a Romanian-born Jew, who immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine in the 1940s. He hand-made the first sets with his family in the backyard of his home. Hertzano sold these sets door-to-door and on a consignment basis at small shops. Over the years, the family licensed it to other countries and it became Israel's best selling export game. In 1977, it became a bestselling game in the United States. The game was marketed as \\"Rummikid\\" during part of the 1970s. Hertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers. The game was first made by Lemada Light Industries Ltd, founded by Hertzano in 1978. Rummikub is similar to several central European card games which are played with two decks of playing cards, including Machiavelli and Vatikan. Vatikan is played with two decks of cards and one joker per player, thus making 106 cards for two players. Game pieces The 106 Rummikub tiles Rummikub's main component is a pool of tiles, consisting of 104 number tiles and two joker tiles. The number tiles range in value from one to thirteen in four colors (blue, red, yellow, and black). Each combination of color and number is represented twice. Players each have a rack to store tiles without revealing the face of the tiles to the other players. Rules The following explanation is based on the rules in the 1998 Pressman American edition: =Setup= The racks of two players. Tiles are shuffled together and either placed into a bag or spread out face down across the table. Each player draws and reveals one tile. The player whose tile has the highest number value will start the game. Tiles are returned to the pool, and players collect 14 random tiles and arrange them on their racks. Play begins with the starting player and proceeds in a clockwise (for modern variants) direction. =Play= For a player's first move, they must play a set (or sets in some versions) with a value of at least 30 points. Point values are taken from the face value of each tile played, with the joker (if played) assuming the value of the tile it is being used in place of. A player may not use other players' tiles to make the \\"initial meld\\". If a player cannot make an initial meld, they must pick up a single tile from the pool and add it to their rack. Play then proceeds to the next player. Once a player has made their initial meld, they can, on each turn, play one or more tiles from their rack, making or adding to groups and/or runs. If the player cannot (or chooses not to) play any tiles, they must pick a tile randomly from the pool and add it to their rack. Players may play tiles by amending sets already in play. The only limit to the length of a run is the extremes of the tile values. Groups are limited to four because colors may not repeat within a group. Sets All tiles in play must be arranged in sets of at least three tiles. The two valid set types are called runs and groups. A run is composed of three or more, same-colored tiles, in consecutive number order. (A 1 may not follow a 13.) :{ - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Example run:  } A group is made from three or four same-value tiles in distinct colors. For example: red 3, blue 3, black 3 and orange 3. :{ - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Example group:  }  Examples of invalid sets  :{ - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Invalid because numbers are not consecutive:  - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Invalid because numbers in a run must all be the same color:  - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Invalid because colors may not repeat in a group (but house rules may allow this):  }  Example of play  :{ - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Tiles already out-played:  - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Own tiles:  - style=\\"line-height: 3em;\\"  Recombined result:  and }  Manipulating existing tiles  During a player's turn, sets of tiles that have already been played may be manipulated to allow more tiles to be played. At the end of the turn, all played tiles must be in valid sets. ; Shifting a run : Players may add the appropriate tile to either end of a run and remove a tile from the other end for use elsewhere. If red 3, 4, and 5 have already been played, a player may add the red 6 to the end and remove the 3 for use elsewhere. ; Splitting a run : Players may split long runs and insert the corresponding tiles in the middle. Thus, if blue 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are already a run, the player may insert his own 8 to make two runs: 6, 7, 8 and 8, 9, 10. ; Substituting in a group : Players may replace any of the tiles in a three-tile group with a tile of the fourth color and the same value. If blue 6, red 6, and orange 6 are already a group, the player may add the black 6 and remove any one of the other three for use elsewhere. ; Removing tiles : So long as the remaining tiles form a valid run, tiles can be removed from the ends of runs. Any one tile may be removed from a four-tile group. ; Joker substitution :A joker may be retrieved before the initial meld. A joker can be retrieved from a set by replacing it with a tile of the same numerical value and colour it represents. The tile used to replace the joker can come from the player's rack or from the table. In the case of a group of 3, the joker can be replaced by the tile of either of the missing colours. A joker that has been replaced must be used in the player's same turn as part of a new set. A set containing a joker can have tiles added to it, be split apart or have tiles removed from it. The joker can be moved or replaced in any possible way as long as you maintain a set of at least three tiles. The joker can be moved or replaced by any missing tile in all possible ways as long as player maintain a set of at least three tiles. The joker has a penalty value of 30 points if it remains on a player's rack at the end of the gameOfficial Rummikub Manual(2017), https://rummikub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2600-English.pdf ; Harvested tiles : In the course of a turn, a tile that is \\"harvested\\" from an existing set must be played during the turn; it cannot be kept for later use. Example: if there is a 3, 4, 5 run on the table, the 3 can be harvested by putting down the appropriately colored 6, but the 3 must be used during that turn, not kept in the player's hand for later use. =Scoring= Once a winner has been declared, the losing players must add up the values of the tiles remaining in their racks (their score for the game). The joker has a penalty value of 30. A player's score for the game is subtracted from his current cumulative score. Once calculated, each of the losing players' scores for the game is added to the winners current cumulative score. For example- suppose in a game player A wins, player B has a score of 5, player C has a score of 10 and player D a score of 3. Player A will now have a cumulative score of 18, player B will be ‚àí5, player C will be ‚àí10 and player D will be ‚àí3. Should the game result in no winner, the player with the lowest number of tiles in their rack is the winner. Scoring is then carried out in the normal manner. If one person never had the required points to make a meld and the game is over, their points are added to the score of each of the other players. The person with the least number of points is the winner. =Winning= Game play continues until a player has used all of the tiles in the rack, at which point they should call out \\"Rummikub,\\" and are declared the winner. If the pool runs out of tiles, play continues until there is a winner or no player can make a valid play.

The game's plot follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S., as they investigate the outskirts of Raccoon City following the disappearance of their team members. They soon become trapped in a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. The player, having selected to play as Chris or Jill at the start of the game, must explore the mansion to uncover its secrets. First conceived by producer Tokuro Fujiwara as a remake of his earlier horror game Sweet Home (1989), the development of Resident Evil was led by Shinji Mikami. It went through several redesigns, initially conceived as a Super NES game in 1993, then as a fully 3D first-person PlayStation game in 1994, and then finally a third-person game with pre-rendered backdrops. Gameplay consists largely of third-person action with added emphasis on inventory management, exploration, and puzzle solving. Resident Evil establishes many conventions seen later in the series, including the control scheme, inventory system, save system, and use of 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. Resident Evil was very well received critically and commercially, and is often credited for defining the survival horror genre. Beyond video games, Resident Evil has been credited with re-popularising zombies in mainstream popular culture from the late 1990s onwards (along with The House of the Dead), leading to a renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. Resident Evil has since been hailed as one of the most influential and greatest video games of all time. Its success has spawned a multimedia franchise including video games, films, comics, novels, and other merchandise. The game has received dedicated ports to the Sega Saturn, Windows, and Nintendo DS. In 2002, a remake of the same name was released for the GameCube featuring updated graphics, sound, and changes to the gameplay and story. A high-definition remaster of the GameCube game was released in 2015 for modern platforms. A sequel, Resident Evil 2, was released in 1998, and a prequel, Resident Evil Zero, in 2002. Gameplay A screenshot of a puzzle that has to be solved at the beginning of the game. The environmental graphics are pre-rendered, whereas the characters and the objects that can be interacted with are real-time polygonal models The player's character is a member of a special law enforcement task force who is trapped in a mansion populated by dangerous mutated creatures. The objective of the game is to uncover the mystery of the mansion and ultimately escape alive. The game's graphics consist of real-time 3D polygonal characters and objects, superimposed over pre-rendered backdrops with fixed camera angles. The player controls the character by pushing the D-pad or analog stick left or right to rotate the character and then move the character forward or backwards by pushing the d-pad up or down (tank controls). To fulfill the game's objective, the player uncovers various documents that provide exposition about the game's narrative, as well as clues that help them solve various puzzles within the mansion. Key items are also available that give the player access to other items or new areas. The player can arm their character with weapons to defend themselves from enemies, although the ammunition available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to conserve the ammunition they have for situations where they will really need it. To restore the character's health, the player uses first-aid sprays or three types of healing herbs that can be mixed together in different combinations for different healing effects. The carrying capacity of the player is limited depending on the character and items that the player does not wish to carry at the moment can be stored into an item box to be retrieved for later use. To save their progress, the player must pick up an ink ribbon and use it on any of the typewriters scattered through key locations in the game. However, the supply of ink ribbons the player can acquire is limited much like the player's ammo and healing supplies. Players will encounter and fight various infected creatures as flesh-eating zombies, undead dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters. Synopsis =Setting= A series of bizarre murders have occurred on the outskirts of Raccoon City, with signs of cannibalism on the victims' remains. The Raccoon Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) are assigned to investigate the murders. S.T.A.R.S. is divided into two teams: Alpha and Bravo. Bravo Team is sent first, but after contact with them is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. =Characters= Players can choose between the two Alpha Team members Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, each with their own unique differential abilities. Jill has more firepower and possesses a lock-pick that enables her to access areas and items easily, as well as an inventory large enough to hold up to eight items, while Chris has limited firepower but is more durable in terms of taking damage from enemies, and a smaller inventory that can hold only six items. The game's supporting characters include Barry Burton, Alpha team's weapons expert who provides Jill with additional firepower; Rebecca Chambers, a surviving member of Bravo team who supports Chris with her medical expertise; Albert Wesker, the captain of S.T.A.R.S. and leader of Alpha team; and Brad Vickers, the helicopter pilot who sends transmissions to them as he tries to find them in the helicopter. The other members of S.T.A.R.S. include Joseph Frost, the sixth member of Alpha team whose sudden death sets the story into motion, Enrico Marini, the leader of Bravo team who gives the player the game's most critical plot twist, Richard Aiken, who gives the player a radio used to receive Brad's transmissions, Kenneth J. Sullivan, a member of Bravo team killed just after Alpha team arrives, and Forest Speyer, whose corpse is found on the balcony by the player. =Story= On July 24, 1998, when a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City, the Raccoon City Police Department's S.T.A.R.S. team are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing team member Joseph Frost. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker, and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. Depending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus. Eventually, the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed, and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction, at which point the player may be confronted by Tyrant one last time. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points over the course of the game. =Endings= Each character has four endings, with the outcome being determined on whether they rescued the other two S.T.A.R.S. survivors or not. The character who is not chosen by the player will be imprisoned in a solitary cell in the mansion's underground lab. In order to access the cell, the player must collect a set of MO Discs distributed within the mansion and use them in different decoding devices to unlock the door. To get the best ending, the player must rescue the other protagonist in addition to their assigned partner. * The best ending has Chris and Jill escaping the mansion alongside a third S.T.A.R.S. member (Rebecca or Barry, depending on who is the player character) after defeating the Tyrant and destroying the mansion. * The second best ending has the player character (Chris or Jill) escaping with his or her partner (Rebecca or Barry) after defeating the Tyrant and destroying the mansion. * The second worst ending has Jill and Chris escaping as the two only survivors, with the mansion still intact and the Tyrant set loose on the forest. * The worst ending has the player character as the sole survivor, with the mansion still intact and the Tyrant set loose on the forest. Development =Production= Resident Evil was created by a team of staff members who would later become part of Capcom Production Studio 4. The project's development began in 1993, and the game took three years to develop.Resident Evil Creator Shinji Mikami Reflects on the Series' Roots , GameSpot (March 22, 2016) The roots of the project can be traced back to a horror game Koji Oda was working on for the Super NES before moving development to the PlayStation in 1994. The inspiration for Resident Evil was the earlier Capcom horror game Sweet Home (1989). Shinji Mikami was initially commissioned to make a game set in a haunted mansion like Sweet Home, which Resident Evil was originally intended to be a remake of.Time Machine: Sweet Home , Computer and Video Games The project was proposed by Sweet Home creator Tokuro Fujiwara, who was Mikami's mentor and served as the game's producer.Shinji Mikami, ¬´ Resident Evil ¬ª et la source du jeu d'horreur , Le Monde (October 10, 2014) Resident Evil was based on Sweet Homes gameplay system, adopting many elements from the game, including the limited item inventory management, the mansion setting, the puzzles, the emphasis on survival, the door loading screen, the use of scattered notes and diary entries as storytelling mechanics, multiple endings depending on how many characters survive, backtracking to previous locations in order to solve puzzles later on, the use of death animations, individual character items such as a lockpick or lighter,Before Resident Evil, There Was Sweet Home, 1UP, 2012 restoring health through items scattered across the mansion, the intricate layout of the mansion, and the brutally horrific imagery.Time Machine: Sweet Home, Computer and Video Games Fujiwara said the \\"basic premise was that I‚Äôd be able to do the things that I wasn‚Äôt able to include\\" in Sweet Home, \\"mainly on the graphics front\\", and that he was \\"confident that horror games could become a genre in themselves.\\" He entrusted Mikami, who was initially reluctant because he hated \\"being scared\\", with the project, because he \\"understood what‚Äôs frightening.\\"The Man Who Made Ghosts‚Äôn Goblins: Tokuro Fujiwara Interview , CONTINUE, Vol. 12, 2003 During the first six months of development, Mikami worked on the game alone, creating concept sketches, designing characters, and writing over 40 pages of script. Several of the Resident Evil mansion's pre-rendered backdrops were inspired by The Overlook Hotel, the setting for the 1980 horror film, The Shining.\\"Resident Evil: A Retrospective\\". Play. February 2000. Mikami also cited the 1979 film Zombie as a negative inspiration for the game. The game was initially conceived as a fully 3D first-person update of Sweet Home (influenced by the game's first- person battles), with action and shooting mechanics. A first-person prototype was produced, and initially featured a supernatural, psychological Japanese horror style similar to Sweet Home, before opting for an American zombie horror style influenced by George Romero films. During production, Mikami discovered Alone in the Dark (1992), which influenced him to adopt a cinematic fixed-view camera system. Mikami said that, if it wasn't for Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil would have had a first-person view instead. Mikami was initially reluctant to adopt Alone in the Darks fixed-view camera system, saying it \\"had an effect on immersion, making the player feel a bit more detached\\", but eventually adopted it because the use of pre-rendered backdrops allowed a higher level of detail than his fully 3D first-person view prototype, which \\"didn't get along so well with the original PlayStation's specs.\\" Only a single concept art of the original first-person prototype has been available since the 1990s, showing more similarity to Doom rather than Alone in the Dark.What Resident Evil Could Have Been , Shacknews A first- person perspective was not used again for the mainline Resident Evil series until Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.Resident Evil 7's Haunted Homecoming , Den of Geek A later prototype featured cooperative gameplay, but this feature was eventually removed, as Mikami said it \\"technically...wasn't good enough.\\" Early footage of this co-op prototype was revealed in 1995. At this stage of development, a local co-op mode was present, along with different outfits. A later demo made for the 1995 V-Jump Festival presentation in Japan featured real-time weapon changes, with the co-op mode removed and rudimentary character models and textures. An early 1996 preview in Maximum Console magazine featured a graveyard and a slightly different version of the final boss. The graveyard, which was removed from the final game, eventually made it into the 2002 remake. Also featured in the game until late in development were guest houses and a tower, which were replaced by the guard house and the lab respectively. Another feature that was removed from the final game was the real-time weapon changing, from the earlier 1995 V-Jump demo. Capcom did not use any motion capture in the game, despite having their own motion capture studio; instead, the animators referred to books and videos to study how people, spiders, and other animals encountered in the game move. In pre- production, other characters were conceived. Dewey, an African-American man, was intended to perform a comic relief role, while Gelzer, a big cyborg, was a typical \\"strongman\\" character. Both were later replaced, by Rebecca and Barry, respectively. Almost all development was done on Silicon Graphics hardware using the software program Soft Image. The PlayStation was chosen as the lead platform because the development team felt it was the most appropriate for the game in terms of things such as the amount of polygons. The development team had upwards of 80 people towards the end of the game's development. According to Akio Sakai, head of Capcom's consumer software division, Capcom were hesitant to port Resident Evil to the Saturn because the hardware was not as ideally suited to the game as the PlayStation, ensuring the port would take a long time. A Saturn version was finally unveiled at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show, at which Capcom also showed a demo for the sequel on PlayStation. The live action full motion video sequences were filmed in Japan with a cast of American actors. All Japanese releases contain English voice acting with Japanese captions and text. However, Japanese voice performances were also recorded but were left unused,Bio Hazard: Complete disc, bundled with Bio Hazard: Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver. as Mikami found the quality of the performances inadequate., The True Story Behind BIO HAZARD, page 157. However, lead programmer Yasuhiro Anpo later said that, due to all of the development staff being Japanese, they were unaware of the \\"poor localization\\" that apparently \\"hindered the realism and immersion of the title\\" for the international release, which was one of the reasons for the re-dub in the 2002 remake. The original Japanese PlayStation version also features a vocal ending theme, , performed by Jpop band Fumitaka Fuchigami, that is not in any other versions of the game. Fujiwara said the game was originally targeted towards a core audience and he only expected it to sell around 200,000 copies, before the game went on to sell millions. Mikami said he was \\"a little worried about how well a horror game would really sell.\\" Anpo said that Capcom did not expect the game to be successful. =English localization= Bio Hazard was renamed for the North America and Europe markets after Chris Kramer, Director of Communications at Capcom, pointed out that it would be impossible to trademark the name in the United States. Among others, the 1992 video game Bio-Hazard Battle and the New York alternative metal band Biohazard were already using the name. Capcom therefore ran an internal company contest to find a new name. The name Resident Evil was settled upon since the game takes place in a mansion. Kramer thought the name \\"was super-cheesy; [I] can't remember what I felt was a better alternative, probably something stupid about zombies ‚Äì but the rest of the marketing crew loved it and were ultimately able to convince Capcom Japan and Mikami-san that the name fit.\\" The cover artwork for the American and European release was done by artist Bill Sienkiewicz.Resident Evil: 1: 12 (April 1996), Marvel The original PlayStation version of Resident Evil went through several considerable changes between its original Japanese release and its international counterparts. The North American and European versions of the intro were heavily cut from the one featured in the Japanese releases. Shots of mangled corpses, a \\"Cerberus\\" zombie dog being shot, and Joseph's death were edited out, as well as scenes featuring the character Chris Redfield smoking a cigarette. Despite these tweaks, the game was ultimately released on the PlayStation as one of the first games to receive the Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board. In the game itself, the auto-aiming function was disabled and the numbers of ink ribbons found by the player were reduced. Capcom also planned to eliminate the interconnected nature of item boxes, meaning that items could only be retrieved from the locations where they were originally stored. This change made it in preview copies of the US version, but was removed from the retail release. This particular game mechanic would resurface in its remake as part of an unlockable difficulty setting. Shinji Mikami noted that they made the American version harder at the request of the American staff so that the game could be rented and not be completed in a few days. Mikami said that this version proved fairly difficult for Capcom staff, who had to play very carefully to complete it. Release =Director's Cut= An updated version, Resident Evil: Director's Cut, was released for PlayStation in September 1997, a year and a half after the original game. Director's Cut was produced to compensate for the highly publicized delay of the sequel, Resident Evil 2, and was originally bundled with a playable pre-release demo of that game. The Japanese version of the demo disc also included a pre- release demo of Rockman Neo, later retitled Rockman DASH (Mega Man Legends outside Japan), and a trailer for the newly released Breath of Fire III. The main addition to Director's Cut is an \\"arranged\\" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well, along with a new \\"beginner\\" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto- aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls. The North American and European releases of the Director's Cut were marketed as featuring the original, uncensored footage from the Japanese releases. However, the full motion video (FMV) sequences were still censored, and Capcom claimed the omission was the result of a localization mistake made by the developers. The game's localization was handled by Capcom Japan instead of Capcom USA, and when submitted to Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), it was rejected because of one line of copyright text. Rather than remove the individual line, Capcom Japan decided to save time and simply swap in the cinematics from the U.S. release of the original Resident Evil. SCEA then approved the game and manufactured a full production run without Capcom USA having any idea that the uncensored scenes had been cut. Three days after the game's release, the uncensored intro was offered as a free download from their website. The French and German PAL versions of Director's Cut do feature the uncensored intro FMV in color, though they lacked the uncensored Kenneth death scene. Although the PC version of Resident Evil was not billed as the director's cut version of the game, it is the only version of Resident Evil that has all of the uncensored FMVs, which includes the uncensored introduction, Kenneth's death scene in its entirety, and ending as well. =Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver.= A third version for the PlayStation, Dual Shock Ver, co-produced by Keiji Inafune, was released in August 1998. It features support for the DualShock controller's analog controls and vibration functions, as well as a new symphonic soundtrack, replacing the original soundtrack by Makoto Tomozawa, Koichi Hiroki, and Masami Ueda. The symphonic music was credited to composer Mamoru Samuragochi, although he admitted in 2014 that he directed his orchestrator Takashi Niigaki to ghostwrite the new soundtrack. The Japanese Dual Shock Ver. came packaged with a bonus disc that contained downloadable save data, footage of the unused Japanese dubbed versions of the live-action cutscenes, along with brief gameplay footage of the canceled original version of Resident Evil 2. In North America, Resident Evil: Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver. was later released as a downloadable game available from the PlayStation Network, although the game is advertised with the original Director's Cut box art. In Japan and Europe, the original Director's Cut was instead made available from the PlayStation Network. =Sega Saturn = The Sega Saturn version added an unlockable battle mode in which the player must traverse through a series of rooms from the main game and eliminate all enemies within them with the weapons selected by the player. It features two exclusive enemies not in the main game: a zombie version of Wesker and a gold-colored Tyrant. The player's performance in the battle mode is graded at the end. The game's backgrounds were touched up to include more detail in this version. The Japanese version is the most gore-laden of all the platforms; after decapitating a crawling zombie with a kick, the head remains on the floor, and Plant 42 can cut the character before the game over screen. The Saturn version also features exclusive enemy monsters, such as a re- skinned breed of Hunters known as Ticks and a second Tyrant prior to the game's final battle. Exclusive outfits for Jill and Chris were added as well. This version was published in Europe by Sega instead of Capcom's usual European publisher, Virgin. =Windows = The Windows version featured the uncensored footage from the Japanese version, and the opening intro is in full color rather than black and white. Support for 3D accelerator cards was added as well, allowing for much sharper graphics. Two new unlockable weapons were added, a MAC-10 for Jill and an FN Minimi for Chris. New unlockable outfits for Chris and Jill were added as well including skipping door animations. =Game Boy Color version= A Game Boy Color version of the game, developed by the Software House HotGen, was supposed to be released in late 1999 or early 2000, until Capcom decided to cancel this project citing that the port was poor quality due to the Game Boy's limited hardware. This version contains every room, cutscene, and almost all the items that were present in the original PlayStation version. In January 2012, an anonymous individual claimed to have an EPROM cartridge of the GBC version and requested $2,000 before he was willing to leak the playable ROM. The goal was met in February and the ROM files containing an unfinished build of the game were subsequently leaked. =Deadly Silence= A Nintendo DS port, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence, was released in Japan as , and was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. Deadly Silence includes a \\"Classic Mode\\", the original game with minimal enhancements and touch-screen support, and a \\"Rebirth Mode\\", containing a greater number of enemies and a series of new puzzles that make use of the platform's specifications. The game makes use of the dual screen display with the top screen used to display the map, along with the player's remaining ammunition and health (determined by the color of the background); while the bottom screen displays the main action, and can be switched to show the player's inventory. The DS version also includes updated play mechanics: the 180-degree turn introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, along with the knife button and tactical reload from Resident Evil 4. The updated controls are applicable to both Classic and Rebirth modes. Just like the PC version, the door animations can be skipped as well as the cut scenes. The live-action footage was still censored, even in the game's Japanese release; however, the scene showing Kenneth's severed head was kept. In \\"Rebirth\\", new puzzles are added that use the system's touch-screen. \\"Knife Battle\\" sequences, viewed from a first-person perspective, are also added, in which the player must fend off incoming enemies by swinging the knife via the stylus. One particular puzzle requires the player to resuscitate an injured comrade by blowing into the built-in microphone. The player can also shake off enemies by using the touch screen, performing a melee attack. The game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes. The first is a cooperative mode in which each player must help each other solve puzzles and escape the mansion together. The other is a competitive mode in which the objective is to get the highest score out of all the players by destroying the most monsters, with the tougher monsters being worth more points. There are three playable multiplayer stages and nine playable characters. Reception The PlayStation game became a best seller in North America. It was also a bestseller in the UK.Gallup UK Playstation sales chart, October 1996, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 11 According to Capcom's Investor Relations website, the original Resident Evil has sold over 2.75 million units. The Director's Cut version, including the Dual Shock edition, sold an additional 2.33 million copies. Shortly after release it became the best-selling PlayStation game at the time. The original PlayStation version of Resident Evil was critically acclaimed, receiving an aggregated rating of 91 out of 100 at Metacritic based on eight reviews. Among of those who praised the game was GameSpot, describing it as \\"one of those rare games that's almost as entertaining to watch as it is to play\\". Famitsu gave it ratings of 9, 10, 10 and 9 out of 10, adding up to 38 out of 40. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1996, along with Super Mario 64 (which scored 39/40) and Tekken 2 (which scored 38/40). Resident Evil was also one of only ten games to have received a Famitsu score of 38/40 or above up until 1996. GamePro described the storyline and cinematics as \\"mostly laughable\\", but felt the gameplay's \\"gripping pace\\" and the heavy challenge of both the combat and the puzzles make the game effectively terrifying. They reassured readers that the unusual control system becomes intuitive with practice and applauded the realism instilled by the graphics and sound effects. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly also commented on the realistic graphics and sounds, and additionally praised the selection of two playable characters. Sushi-X remarked that it, \\"at first glance, may appear to be a clone of Alone in the Dark, but in reality, it is a totally new experience\\". Mark Lefebvre particularly remarked, \\"The element that really grabs a player here is fear. After trading blows with the first zombie, you'll quickly become hesitant to turn down any uncharted corridors in the mansion.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation said it \\"manages to be as genuinely scary as a good horror film - no small achievement. There are a lot of things that work around games being this frightening ... In this case, however, the fine character work, creepy and well-executed sound effects, and just the right music in just the right places all have a subtle, cumulative effect ...\\" While criticizing the \\"laughable\\" dialogue and voice acting, he felt they were overridden by the game's positive aspects. He pointed out that the lack of genuinely confounding puzzles allows the game to move at a good pace, and the use of prerendered backgrounds allowed the PlayStation to handle much more detailed characters. Yasuhiro Hunter of Maximum stated that \\"The game has the greatest atmosphere of any other game in existence - naming a game that makes you jump as much as when encountering your first pair of Cereberos in this title would be very difficult.\\" He also praised the heavy difficulty of the puzzles, the great care required in combat, the 3D graphics, and the exceptionally high replay value. Computer Gaming World gave a more mixed review for the Windows version, explaining that they \\"tried to hate it with its graphic violence, rampant sexism, poor voice acting and use of every horror clich√©, however...it's actually fun.\\" The Saturn version was also very well-received. While most remarked that Capcom had taken too long to bring Resident Evil to the console (the game had been out on the PlayStation for well over a year, and hype had built up for Resident Evil 2, which would be released in just a few months), critics agreed that the game was still as stunning as it had been on its initial release and had been accurately recreated for the Saturn. Computer and Video Games, for example, commented that \\"With all the talk about the Saturn being inferior in this department, the [graphics] quality cannot be surpassed. All of the rooms, the enemies and the animation are almost identical.\\" GamePro, which gave it identical scores to the PlayStation version (a 4.0 out of 5 for control, and a perfect 5.0 for graphics, sound, and funfactor), summarized that \\"It would have been nice to have it on the Saturn sooner, but this is as close to a sure thing as you could ask for.\\" Sega Saturn Magazine said that \\"the intense feeling of terror heightened by the chilling music and eerie silences ... sets Resident Evil apart from any other adventure game you may care to mention.\\" Critics also widely praised the Saturn-exclusive Battle Mode. The Director's Cut was positively received as well, with most critics regarding the advanced mode and the bundled Resident Evil 2 demo as the highlights. However, all four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly decried it, arguing that a handful of changes and a demo disc were not enough to justify the price. Resident Evil was the first game to be dubbed a \\"survival horror\\", a term that it coined for the genre. It was ranked as the 91st top game of all time by Next Generation in 1996, for having \\"successfully redefine[d] the genre which started with Infogrames' Alone in the Dark.\\"Next Generation 21 (September 1996), p.38-39. Game Informer referred to the original Resident Evil as \\"one of the most important games of all-time\\" in 2007. In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. That same year, the game ranked as one of G4tv's top video games of all time for how it has \\"launched one of the most successful series in gaming history and provided one of its most memorable scares.\\" In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Resident Evil as the 37th top retro game, with the staff calling it \\"one of the finest horror-themed games ever\\" and adding that \\"full of shocks, surprises and perfectly poor B-movie dialogue, Resident Evil is the gaming equivalent of Night of the Living Dead.\\"Retro Gamer 8, page 67. It entered the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008 for the \\"Worst Game Dialogue Ever.\\" Stuff ranked it as the 3rd best PlayStation game of all time. Sequels The game's success resulted in a media franchise that has since branched out into comic books, novels and novelizations, sound dramas, a non-canonical series of live-action films and animated sequels to the games, and a variety of associated merchandise, such as action figures. The series has become Capcom's biggest franchise. The events of the game were also revisited in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, originally released for the Wii in 2007. =Novelization= Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy is a 1998 novelization of the game, was written by S. D. Perry as the first book in her series of Resident Evil novels. The novel combines Jill's and Chris scenarios into one narrative and features all five of the main characters (including Barry, Rebecca and Wesker). The book also takes liberty with some of the original source materials; the most notable difference being the inclusion of an original character named Trent, an insider from the Umbrella Corporation who provides Jill with information about the Spencer Mansion prior to the events of the mansion incident. Since the book was written a few years before the Nintendo GameCube remake, the novelization lacks the presence of Lisa Trevor in the mansion. However, the book does allude to the original version of George Trevor's journal from The True Story Behind Bio Hazard, as well as the short story it contained, \\"Bio Hazard: The Beginning\\", which involved the disappearance of Chris Redfield's friend, Billy Rabbitson. Another notable difference in the novels is moving the location of Raccoon City from the Midwest to Pennsylvania, apparently about an hour's drive from New York. Overall, despite having been written before the retcon introduced in the Resident Evil remake and Resident Evil Zero, the book still maintains overall similarity to what the story warped into in the early 2000s. =Remake= In 2002, Resident Evil was remade for the GameCube as part of an exclusivity agreement between Capcom and Nintendo that spanned three new games. The remake includes a variety of new gameplay elements, environments, and story details, as well as improved visuals and sound. The game was also later ported for the Wii in 2008. A remastered version of the remake, featuring high definition graphics, was released as a download for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, Xbox One in 2015, with a limited edition PlayStation 3 version released at retail in Japan. Cultural impact GameSpot listed Resident Evil as one of the fifteen most influential video games of all time. It is credited with defining and popularizing the survival horror genre of games. It is also credited with taking video games in a cinematic direction with its B-movie style cut-scenes. Its live-action opening, however, was controversial; it became one of the first action games to receive the \\"Mature 17+\\" (M) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), despite the opening cutscene being censored in North America. Resident Evil is credited with sparking a revival of the zombie genre in popular culture since the late 1990s, leading to a renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. In 2013, George Romero said it was the video games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead \\"more than anything else\\" that popularised zombies in early 21st-century popular culture. In a 2015 interview with Huffington Post, screenwriter-director Alex Garland credited the original Resident Evil video game as a primary influence on his script for the horror film 28 Days Later (2002), and credited the first Resident Evil game for revitalizing the zombie genre. Shaun of the Dead (2004) star and co-writer Simon Pegg also credits the original Resident Evil game with starting the zombie revival in popular culture. After the original Resident Evil video game sparked a renewed interest in the zombie genre, it was followed by zombie films such as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Shaun of the Dead, 28 Weeks Later (2007), Zombieland (2009), Cockneys vs Zombies (2012), and World War Z (2013), as well as zombie-themed graphic novels and television shows such as The Walking Dead and The Returned, and books such as World War Z (2006), Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009) and Warm Bodies (2010). The Resident Evil film adaptations also went on to become the highest-grossing film series based on video games, after they grossed more than worldwide. The zombie revival trend was popular up until the mid-2010s, before zombie films declined in popularity by the late 2010s.

As chief of staff, McConnell served in a dual capacity. He was a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which, as a body, acts as the principal military adviser to the President of the United States, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. In his other capacity, he was responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force for managing the vast human and materiel resources of the world's most powerful aerospace force. Early life and education John Paul McConnell was the son of Dr. Samuel Paul McConnell, a medical doctor, and Desseau M. (Dorsey) McConnell. A native of Booneville, Arkansas, McConnell graduated magna cum laude from Henderson Brown College at Arkadelphia, Arkansas, with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1927. He entered West Point a year later and, at the time of his graduation in 1932, was First Captain of the Corps of Cadets. After taking flying training at Randolph and Kelly Fields, Texas, he received his pilot wings in 1933. Military career A fighter pilot during his early years in the then-Army Air Corps, later Army Air Forces, McConnell gained broad experience through a variety of operational and administrative assignments, including duty as assistant executive in the Office of the Chief of Air Forces in Washington. Subsequently, he served in key Air Force positions in both Asia and Europe. In 1943 McConnell became chief of staff of the China-Burma-India Air Force Training Command at Karachi, India (later part of Pakistan), and remained in Asia for the rest of World War II. While senior air staff officer, Air Command Southeast Asia, and deputy commander of the Third Tactical Air Force in 1944, he participated in combat operations against the Japanese in Burma. In 1946 he was named senior air adviser to the Chinese government and, at the same time, commanded the Air Division, Nanking Headquarters Command. McConnell returned to Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. in 1947 to become chief of the Reserve and National Guard Division and, the next year, was appointed chief of the Air Force's Civilian Components Group. Assigned to England in 1950, he served as deputy commander and later, commander of the Third Air Force. He then took command of the 7th Air Division of the Strategic Air Command, commanding the Third Air Force at the same time. This was followed by a four-year tour as director of Plans at Headquarters Strategic Air Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. In 1957 he was named commander of Second Air Force, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and four years later returned to Strategic Air Command to become vice commander in chief. In 1962 McConnell was assigned to Europe as deputy commander in chief of the United States European Command and promoted to the rank of general. He was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in August 1964, and assumed the position of Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on 1 February 1965, relieving General Curtis E. LeMay. His appointment as chief of staff was extended to July 1969. McConnell's decorations included the Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit with three oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, and numerous foreign awards, including Commander of the Order of the British Empire and the Legion of Honor ‚Äì Degree of Commandeur (France). In June 1965, McConnell was presented an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Akron, Akron, Ohio. He also received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville in June 1966. McConnell retired from the Air Force on July 31, 1969 and died November 21, 1986 in Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland. A funeral service was held on November 25 in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. with burial in the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The public library in his hometown of Booneville, Arkansas is named in his honor and contains many items of memorabilia from his years of service to the US Air Force, including service medals, decorations and commendations. Postscript McConnell's role as Chief of Staff of the Air Force, as well as that of the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Vietnam War, specifically under the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, has recently been the subject of significant historical research in the area of the relationships between senior military leaders (e.g., the JCS) and the civilian political leadership (e.g., the National Command Authority)Dereliction of Duty, McMaster, H.R., Harper Collins Publishers, New York, NY, c1997, and has increasingly become a topical discussion issue and object lesson for officers attending the nation's senior service colleges (i.e., Air War College, Army War College, Naval War College and National War College). The Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted McConnell into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1985. McConnell's son, Dorsey W. M. McConnell, is bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh.

Because of his restless behaviour, he was regarded as a loose cannon. At the end of 1916, he participated in the killing of Grigori Rasputin.  Early career  Born as the son of a poor nobleman in Bessarabia, now Moldova, Purishkevich graduated from Novorossiysk University with a degree in classical philology.Ronald C. Moe, Prelude to the Revolution: The Murder of Rasputin, p. 232. (Aventine Press, 2011). Around 1900, he moved to Saint Petersburg. He became a member of the Russian Assembly group and was appointed under Vyacheslav von Plehve. Vladimir Purishkevich During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he helped organise the Black Hundreds as a militia to aid the police in the fight against left-wing extremists and to restore order. After the October Manifesto, he was one of the founders of the Union of the Russian People and its deputy chairman. Following a disagreement with Alexander Dubrovin on the influence of the State Duma, he founded his own organisation, the Union of the Archangel Michael, in 1908. The popular Purishkevich, described by Vladimir Kokovtsov as a charming, unstable man who could not stay a single minute in one place,Out of My Past: Memoirs of Count Kokovtsov, p. 170. was elected as a deputy of the second, third and fourth Imperial Dumas for the Bessarabian and Kursk province. He gained fame for his flamboyant speeches and scandalous behaviour such as speaking on the 1st of May with a red carnation in his fly. He was a hardline supporter of sacerdotal autocracy, and of Russification to create a unity. Purishkevich's hostility to the Jews was caused by his perception of them to be the \\"vanguard of the revolutionary movement\\". He wanted them to be deported to Kolyma. He believed that the \\"Kadets, socialists, the intelligentsia, the press and councils of university professors\\" were all under the control of Jews.Langer, Jack Fighting The Future: the doomed anti-revolutionary crusade of Vladimir Purishkevich Revolutionary Russia (journal) Vol. 9, No. 1 June 2006 P42 During the war, Purishkevich became critical of the performance of the government and the role of Alexandra and Rasputin but not of the Tsar. Criticism of Rasputin On 3 November 1916, Purishkevich went to Mogilev and talked with Tsar Nicolas II on Rasputin.Pim van der Meiden (1991) Raspoetin en de val van het Tsarenrijk, p. 71. On 19 November, Purishkevich gave a speech in the Duma and coined the phrase \\"ministerial leapfrog\\" to describe the seemingly continuous government reshuffles.Rabinowitch, Alexander Prelude to Revolution: The Petrograd Bolsheviks and the July 1917 Uprising Indiana University Press (1991) p22 He compared Rasputin with the False Dmitri. The monarchy was becoming discredited:O. Figes (1997) A People's Tragedy: A History of the Russian Revolution, p. 278. The Cambridge History of Russia: Volume 2, Imperial Russia, 1689-1917, p. 668 by Maureen Perrie, Dominic Lieven, Ronald Grigor Suny Rasputin and the Imperial couple. Anonymous caricature in 1916 Purishkevich stated that Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina had made him a threat to the empire: \\"an obscure moujik shall govern Russia no longer!\\"The Russian Provisional Government, 1917: Documents, Volume 1, p. 17 by Robert Paul Browder, Aleksandr Fyodorovich Kerensky \\"While Rasputin is alive, we cannot win\\". Killing of Rasputin Prince Felix Yusupov was impressed by the speech. He visited Purishkevich, who quickly agreed to participate in the killing of Rasputin. Also, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich joined the conspiracy. Purishkevich talked to Samuel Hoare, the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service in Petrograd. A wealthy person, Purishkevich organised a medical aid that went up and down to the Eastern Front to deliver wounded soldiers to the hospitals in Tsarskoye Selo. On the evening of 16 December 1916, the conspirators gathered in the Moika Palace and eventually killed Rasputin. A curious policeman on duty on the other side of the Moika had heard the shots, rang at the door and was sent away. Half-an-hour later, another policeman arrived, and Purishkevich invited him into the palace. Purishkevich told him that he had shot Rasputin and asked him to keep it quiet for the sake of the Tsar. Medical aid train in 1916 They had planned to burn Rasputin's possessions. Sukhotin put on Rasputin's fur coat, rubber boots and gloves. He left with Dmitri and Dr Lazovert in Purishkevich's car, which suggests that Rasputin had left the palace alive.J.T. Fuhrmann, p. 211. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots in her small fireplace in the ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the larger items. Yusupov and Dmitri were placed under house arrest in the Sergei Palace. The Tsarina had refused to meet them but said that they could explain to her what had happened in a letter. Purishkevich assisted them and left the city to the Romanian front at ten in the evening. Because of his popularity, Purishkevich was neither punished nor banned. Revolutionary Russia Moika Embankment with the former hotel \\"Russia\\" During the February Revolution in 1917, many right-wingers were arrested but Purishkevich was tolerated by the government and so was \\"virtually the only former national Black Hundred leader to maintain an active political life in Russia after the Tsar's downfall\\".Langer, Jack Fighting The Future: the doomed anti- revolutionary crusade of Vladimir Purishkevich Revolutionary Russia (journal) Vol 19, No.1 June 2006 P45 However, the revolution meant that Purishkevich initially had to moderate his politics. He called for the abolition of the Soviets, who were, in turn, calling for the abolition of the Duma. In August 1917, he wanted a military dictatorship; he was arrested over the Kornilov Affair but was released. Following the failure of the putsch, he collaborated with Fyodor Viktorovich Vinberg in forming an underground monarchist organisation.Kellogg, Michael The Russian Roots of Nazism: White √âmigr√©s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 Cambridge University Press (2005) p44 During the October Revolution, he organized the \\"Committee for the Motherland's Salvation\\". He was joined by a number of officers, military cadets, and others. At the time, Purishkevich lived in hotel \\"Russia\\" on Moika 60, and he had a false passport under the surname \\"Yevreinov\\". On 18 November 1917, Purishkevich was arrested by the Red Guards for his participation in a counterrevolutionary conspiracy after the discovery of a letter sent by him to General Aleksei Maksimovich Kaledin in which he urged the Cossack leader to come and restore order in Petrograd.Andrew Kalpaschnikoff, A Prisoner of Trotsky's, 1920 He became the first person to be tried in the Smolny Institute by the first Revolutionary Tribunal. He was condemned to eleven months of 'public work' and four years of imprisonment with obligatory community service, and won the admiration of his fellow prisoners in the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul by his courageous bearing.Irene Zohrab, \\"The Liberals among the forces of the Revolution: from the unpublished papers of Harold W. Williams\\". New Zealand Slavonic Journal, 20, (1986), 63-64. He was given an amnesty on May 1 after the mediation of Felix Dzerzhinsky and Nikolay Krestinsky, as he refrained from any political activity. In jail, he had written a poem describing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as 'The Trotsky Peace'. White Russia Union of the Archangel Michael emblem After his release, he moved to White Army controlled Southern Russia. There, during the Russian Civil War he published the monarchist journal Blagovest and returned openly to his traditional political stance of support for the monarchy, a unified Russia and opposition to the Jews. In some of the towns occupied by the Volunteer Army, he gave lectures in which he denounced the British policy towards Russia. In 1918, he formed a new political party, the People's State Party, and called for an \\"open fight against Jewry\\";Kellogg, Michael The Russian Roots of Nazism: White √âmigr√©s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 Cambridge University Press (2005) pp102-3 the party collapsed after his death. Vladimir Purishkevich died from typhus that raged Novorossiysk in 1920, just before the final evacuation of Denikin's Army. Reputation In 1925, Soviet writer Liubosh would describe Purishkevich as the 'first' fascist.Liubosh, S. B., Russkii fashist V. M. Purishkevich, Leningrad: Byloe Publishing House, 1925Shenfield, Stephen Russian Fascism: Traditions, Tendencies and Movements Routledge, 2015, p. 31 He was subsequently referred to as a \\"leader of early Russian fascism\\" by Semyon Reznik, who also claimed that Purishkevich participated in numerous pogroms and was a significant proponent of the blood libel against Jews.

Tropomyosin and the actin skeleton All organisms contain organelles that provide physical integrity to their cells. These type of organelles are collectively known as the cytoskeleton, and one of the most ancient systems is based on filamentous polymers of the protein actin. A polymer of a second protein, tropomyosin, is an integral part of most actin filaments in animals. Tropomyosins are a large family of integral components of actin filaments that play a critical role in regulating the function of actin filaments in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. These proteins consist of rod-shaped coiled-coil hetero- or homo-dimers that lie along the Œ±-helical groove of most actin filaments. Interaction occurs along the length of the actin filament, with dimers aligning in a head-to-tail fashion. Tropomyosins are often categorised into two groups, muscle tropomyosin isoforms and nonmuscle tropomyosin isoforms. Muscle tropomyosin isoforms are involved in regulating interactions between actin and myosin in the muscle sarcomere and play a pivotal role in regulated muscle contraction. Nonmuscle tropomyosin isoforms function in all cells, both muscle and nonmuscle cells, and are involved in a range of cellular pathways that control and regulate the cell's cytoskeleton and other key cellular functions. The actin filament system that is involved in regulating these cellular pathways is more complex than the actin filament systems that regulates muscle contraction. The contractile system relies upon 4 actin filament isoforms and 5 tropomyosin isoforms, whereas the actin filament system of the cytoskeleton uses two actin filament isoforms and over 40 tropomyosin isoforms. Isoforms and evolution In direct contrast of the 'one gene, one polypeptide' rule, we now know from a combination of genomic sequencing, such as the Human Genome Project and EST data of expressed proteins that many eukaryotes produce a range of proteins from a single gene. This plays a crucial role in the functionality of higher eukaryotes, with humans expressing more than 5 times as many different proteins (isoforms) through alternative splicing than they have genes. From a mechanistic point of view, it is much easier for an organism to expand on a current gene/protein family (creating protein isoforms) than it is to create an entirely new gene. From an evolutionary point of view, tropomyosins in higher eukaryotes are notable in retaining all 4 of the potential genes produced by the dual genomic duplication event that took place in early eukaryotic evolution. Genes and isoforms (isoform complexity) Within mammals, four genes are responsible for generating more than 40 different tropomyosin isoforms. In terms of structure, the genes are very similar, suggesting that they arose through gene duplication of an ancestral gene. In humans, these genes are no longer linked and are widely dispersed. In humans, the Œ±-, Œ≤-, Œ≥-, and Œ¥-genes are formally known as TPM1, TPM2, TPM3, and TPM4 and are located at 15q22, 9p13, 1q22 and 19p13, respectively. Isoforms are defined as highly related gene products that perform, in essence, similar biological functions, with variations existing between the isoforms in terms of biological activity, regulatory properties, temporal and spatial expression, and/or the intercellular location. Isoforms are produced by two distinct mechanisms, gene duplication and alternative splicing. The former mechanism is a process by which multiple copies of a gene are generated through unequal crossing over, through tandem duplication, or by translocation. Alternative splicing is a mechanism wherein exons are either retained in the mRNA or targeted for removal in different combinations to create a diverse array of mRNAs from a single pre-mRNA. Splicing A vast array of tropomyosin isoforms are generated by using a combination of different genes and alternative splicing. In mammals, regardless of the gene, transcription is initiated at the start of either exon 1a or exon 1b. Depending on which promoter and initial exon used, the tropomyosin isoforms can be categorized as either high-molecular-weight (HMW, 284 amino acids) or low-molecular-weight (LMW, 248). HMW isoforms express exon 1a and either 2a or 2b, while LMW isoforms express exon 1b. To date, all known tropomyosins contain exons 3-9. Alternative splicing can occur at exon 6, with the mutually exclusive choice of exon 6a or 6b. At the c-terminus, the transcript is spliced again at exon 9, with the choice of exon 9a, 9b, 9c, or 9d. Evolution of isoform generation In terms of structure, the genes are very similar, suggesting that they arose through gene duplication of an ancestral gene. The most highly related genes are the Œ±- and Œ≥-genes, utilizing two promoters and differing only with the presence of the unique 2a exon in the Œ±-gene. Although substantial differences between alternative exons from the same gene have been revealed by sequence comparison (1a and 1b, 6a and 6b, and the exon 9s), most exons are, however, highly conserved between the different genes. For example, exon 1a and 1b from the Œ±-gene vary considerably in sequence; however, the sequence from exon 1a from the Œ±-, Œ≤-, Œ≥-, and Œ¥-genes is highly conserved. Due to the conservative nature of the genes, it is believed that the genes evolved from a common ancestral gene, giving rise to over 40 functionally distinct isoforms. The expression of these isoforms is highly regulated and variable throughout development. The diversity of tropomyosin expression, both in space and in time, provides the potential not only to regulate actin filament function but to create specialised actin filament populations. Spatial sorting of tropomyosin isoforms Numerous reports detail that tropomyosin isoforms are sorted to different intracellular locations, often associating with actin filament populations that are involved in specific processes. Direct visualization of spatial segregation of isoforms was initially observed by Burgoyne and Norman and soon after by Lin and co- workers. They observed that specific isoforms were associated with distinct cellular structures. Using specific antibodies, they were able to identify the presence of both HMW and the LMW isoforms of the Œ≥-gene in stress fibers; however, only LMW isoforms were detected in ruffling membranes. These studies have been extended to a number of cell types with similar results. Extensive studies in neuronal cells, fibroblasts, skeletal muscle and osteoclast cells has further highlighted the complex association tropomyosin isoforms have with cellular structures. These studies have led to the realization that the regulation of isoform sorting is extremely complex and highly regulated. =Regulation of sorting= Sorting of tropomyosin isoforms in discrete intracellular locations is developmentally regulated. Initial studies reported that the sorting of isoforms changed through development, where Tropomyosin 4 was initially localized to the growth cone of growing neurons, but in mature neurons it was relocated to the somatodendritic compartment. These observations have been supported by studies on different tropomyosin isoforms, showing how tropomyosin populations were relocated during neuron maturation. This evidence is supportive of the notion that tropomyosin isoforms are subject to temporal regulation. Additional studies have identified the role the cell cycle plays in isoform sorting. A study that screened a range HMW products from the Œ±- and Œ≤-genes and compared localisation with LMW products from the Œ≥-gene found that the HMW and LMW products are mutually exclusively segregated during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. PDB: 1C1G Tropomyosin chain A,B,C,D =Mechanism of sorting= While studies suggest that tropomyosin sorting may be influenced by the sorting of mRNAs, there is no absolute correlation between mRNA and protein location. In neurons, Tropomyosin 5NM1 mRNA was found to sort to the pole of the neuron elaborating an axon prior to morphological differentiation. The sorting of Tropomyosin 5NM1/2 mRNA to this location correlated with the expression of the Tropomyosin 5NM1/2 protein. In contrast, the mRNA encoding the Tropomyosin Br2 protein was excluded from the pole of the neuron. The link between mRNA sorting and protein location has been tested in transgenic mice models. The models were created so that the coding regions of Tropomyosin 5NM1/2 and Tropomyosin 3 were expressed under the control of the Œ≤-actin promoter with the a Œ≤-actin 3'-untranslated region lacking targeting information. The study found that Tropomyosin 3, an isoform that is not normally expressed in neuronal cells, was broadly distributed throughout the neuron, while exogenous expression of the neuronal isoform Tropomyosin 5NM1/2 was found to sort to the growth cone of neurons as does the endogenous Tropomyosin 5NM1/2. As these two transgenes differ only in the tropomyosin coding region yet are localized in two distinct areas, the findings suggest that, in addition to mRNA sorting, the proteins themselves contain sorting information. Studies suggest that tropomyosin isoform sorting may also be influenced by the actin isoform composition of microfilaments. In myoblasts, overexpression of Œ≥-actin resulted in the down- regulation of Œ≤‚Äìactin and the removal of Tropomyosin 2 but not Tropomyosin 5 from stress fibers. It was later found that, when cells were exposed to cytochalasin D, a chemical that results in the disorganization of actin filaments, tropomyosin isoform sorting was disrupted. Upon the washing out of cytochalasin D, tropomyosin isoform sorting was re-established. This is suggestive of a strong relationship between the process of tropomyosin isoform sorting and the incorporation of tropomyosin isoforms into organized arrays of actin filaments. There is no evidence for active transport of tropomyosin isoforms to specific locations. Rather, it appears that sorting is the result of local assembly of preferred isoforms at specific intracellular site. The mechanisms that underlie tropomyosin isoform sorting appear to be inherently flexible and dynamic in nature. Isoforms are not functionally redundant Many studies have led to the understanding that tropomyosins perform essential functions and are required in a diverse range of species from yeast, worms, and flies to complex mammals. The essential role of tropomyosins was discovered in the Bretscher laboratory, where researchers found that, by eliminating the TPM1 gene of budding yeasts, growth rates were reduced, the presence of actin cables disappeared, defects in vesicular transport were observed, and mating of the yeast was poor. When a second yeast gene, TPM2, was deleted, no observable changes in the phenotype were recorded; however, when deleted in combination with TPM1, it resulted in lethality. This suggests that TPM1 and -2 genes have overlapping function; however, TPM2 cannot fully compensate of the loss of TPM1, indicating that some functions of TPM1 are unique. Similar results have been observed in flies, worms, amphibians, and mammals, confirming previous results and suggestive of tropomyosin's being involved in a wide range of cellular functions. However, the three co- expressed TMP1, 2, and 4 genes cannot compensate for deletion of the TPM3 gene in embryonic stem cells and preimplantation mouse embryos. Results from gene knockout experiments can be ambiguous and must be carefully examined. In studies in which the deletion of a gene leads to lethality, it can at first appear that the gene product had a truly unique role. However, lethality can also be the result of the inability of the compromised cell to express other isoforms to rescue the phenotype because the required isoform is not naturally expressed in the cell. Specific roles and functions =Influencing binding of actin binding proteins to actin filaments= The actin microfilament system is the fundamental cytoskeletal system involved in the development and maintenance of cell morphology. The ability of this system to readily respond to cellular cues and undergo structural re-organisation has led to the belief that this system regulates specific structural changes within different cellular regions. Within humans, there are only six actin isoforms, and these isoforms are responsible for an array of unique and complex cellular structures and key cellular interactions. It is thought that the function and form of the actin cytoskeleton is controlled largely by actin-binding proteins (ABP) that are associated with the actin polymer. ABP are a group of proteins that bind to actin. Although tropomyosin is sometimes included as an ABP, it is not a true ABP. The tropomyosin dimer has very low affinity for an actin filament and forms no van der waals contacts with actin. It is only the formation of a tropomyosin polymer's winding around the actin filament that provides stability to the tropomyosin-actin filament interaction. Many studies suggest that the binding of tropomyosin isoforms to an actin filament may influence the binding of other ABPs, which together alter the structure and convey specific properties and ultimately specific functions to an actin filament. This is demonstrated in neuroepithelial cells, where increased expression of Tropomyosin 5NM1 increases the recruitment of myosin IIB, a myosin motor protein to the growth cone area. However, the over-expression of Tropomyosin Br3 had the opposite effect, decreasing myosin activity in the same region. In a pioneering study by Bernstein and Bamburg, it was observed that the actin-binding protein actin depolymerisation factor (ADF)/cofilin, a factor that promotes actin filament depolymerisation, competed with tropomyosin for binding to the actin filament. The expression of Tropomyosin 5NM1 in neuronal cells eliminated ADF/cofilin from the growth cone region, leading to more stable actin filaments. However, the increased expression of Tropomyosin Br3 was observed to recruit ADF/cofilin to actin filaments bound to the Tropomyosin Br3 isoform within the lamellipodium, which led to the disassembly of actin filaments. This phenomenon, whereby a specific tropomyosin isoform directs specific interactions between actin-binding proteins, and the actin filament has been observed in a variety of model systems with a range of different binding proteins (reviewed in Gunning et al., 2008). These interactions, under the influence of tropomyosin isoforms, allow actin filaments to be involved in a diverse range of cellular functions. =Function in skeletal muscle contraction= Skeletal muscle is composed of large, multi-nucleated cells (muscle fibers). Each muscle fiber is packed with longitudinal arrays of myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating protein structures or sarcomeres, the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle. The sarcomere is a highly structured protein array, consisting of interdigitating thick and thin filaments, where the thin filaments are tethered to a protein structure, the Z-line. The dynamic interaction between the thick and thin filaments results in muscle contraction. Myosin belongs to a family of motor proteins, and the muscle isoforms of this family comprise the thick filament. The thin filament is made of the skeletal muscle isoforms of actin. Each myosin protein 'paddles' along the thin actin filament, repeatedly binding to myosin-binding sites along the actin filament, ratcheting and letting go. In effect, the thick filament moves or slides along the thin filament, resulting in muscle contraction. This process is known as the sliding filament model. The binding of the myosin heads to the muscle actin is a highly regulated process. The thin filament is made of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin. The contraction of skeletal muscle is triggered by nerve impulses that in turn stimulate the release of Ca2+. The release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes an increase in the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol. Calcium ions then bind to troponin, which is associated with tropomyosin. Binding causes changes in the shape of troponin and subsequently causes the tropomyosin isoform to shift its position on the actin filament. This shifting in position exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament, allowing the myosin heads of the thick filament to bind to the thin filament. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the position of tropomyosin and troponin on the thin filament regulates the interactions between the myosin heads of the thick filament and the binding sites on the actin of the thin filament. X-ray diffraction and cryoelectron microscopy suggest that tropomyosin sterically blocks the access of myosin to the actin filament. Although this model is well-established, it is unclear as to whether the movement of tropomyosin directly causes the myosin head to engage the actin filament. As such, an alternative model has emerged, whereby the movement of the tropomyosin in the filament functions as an allosteric switch that is modulated by activating myosin binding but does not function solely by regulating myosin binding. =Regulation of contraction in smooth muscle= Smooth muscle is a type of non-striated muscle, and, unlike striated muscle, contraction of smooth muscle is not under conscious control. Smooth muscle may contract spontaneously or rhythmically and be induced by a number of physiochemical agents (hormones, drugs, neurotransmitters). Smooth muscle is found within the walls of various organs and tubes in the body such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, bronchi, urethra, bladder, and blood vessels. Although smooth muscles do not form regular arrays of thick and thin filaments like the sarcomeres of striated muscles, contraction is still due to the same sliding filament mechanism controlled by myosin crossbridges interacting with actin filaments. The thin filament of smooth muscle is made of actin, tropomyosin, caldesmon, and calmodulin. Within this type of muscle, caldesmon and calmodulin control the tropomyosin-mediated transition between on and off activity states. Caldesmon binds to actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, and myosin, of which its interactions with actin are most important. The binding of caldesmon is strongly influenced by tropomyosin. Caldesmon is an inhibitor of actinomyosin ATPase and motility, and both actin binding and caldesmon inhibition are greatly enhanced in the presence of tropomyosin. Smooth muscle contraction is initiated by the release of Ca2+. Ca2+ binds to and activates calmodulin, which then binds to caldesmon. This binding causes the caldesmon protein to disengage from the actin filament, exposing the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament. Myosin motor heads are phosphorylated by myosin light-chain kinase, allowing the myosin head to interact with the actin filament and cause contraction. =Role in cytoskeleton function= The cytoskeleton is an elaborate network of filaments required for the proper functioning of a range of cellular processes including cell motility, cell division, intracellular trafficking, and the maintenance of cell shape. The cytoskeleton is composed of three distinct filament systems: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments (also known as the actin cytoskeleton). It is the dynamic interactions between these filaments that provide cells with unique structures and functions. A number of regulatory mechanisms, employing many actin-binding proteins, have evolved to control the dynamics of the actin filament system. It is believed that tropomyosins play a pivotal role in this regulatory system, influencing the associations the actin filament has with other ABPs. Together, these associations confer specific properties on the filament, allowing these structures to be involved in a wide range of cellular processes, but also to rapidly respond to cellular stimuli. Role in diseases =Cancer= Many studies have shown that there are specific changes to the repertoire of tropomyosins expressed in cells that are undergoing cellular transformation. These highly reproducible results suggest that, during the process of cellular transformation, a process whereby a normal cell becomes malignant, there is a decreased synthesis of HMW tropomyosin isoforms. In the initial studies, transformation of rat embryo fibroblast cell line REF-52 and of normal rat kidney cells led to decreased synthesis of HMW tropomyosins. In both of these systems, the down regulation was contributed to a decrease in the mRNA levels. These early results suggested that tropomyosins played a critical role in facilitating certain processes that occurred during cell transformation, such as actin filament re- organisation and changes in cell shape. These studies have been reproduced in other laboratories and in other cell lines, with similar results (reviewed in Gunning et al., 2008). Furthermore, studies have highlighted a link between tropomyosin isoform expression and the acquisition of metastatic properties. A study compared isoform expression between a low- and highly-metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma cell line. The study found that as cells become more metastatic, there is a marked decrease in the expression of HMW tropomyosin 2 protein and mRNA levels. These results have been confirmed in primary tumors and human models. Studies in colon and bladder cancer found increased expression of the LMW tropomyosin Tropomyosin 5NM1. The elevated expression of this isoform has also been seen in transformed rat fibroblasts, and it is thought that this isoform is required for the motility of highly metastatic melanoma. In addition, elevated expression of Tropomyosin 4 has been linked with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. All of these studies suggest that changes in the expression and complement of tropomyosin isoforms are integral to cancer and cancer progression. The consensus is that, in general, cancer cells become more reliant on LMW tropomyosins as HMW tropomyosins disappear with increasing malignancy. This discovery has led to the development of novel anti-tropomyosin compounds as potential anti-cancer agents. =Autoimmunity= Tropomyosins have been implicated in the autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis, a disease of the colon that is characterised by ulcers or open sores. The link between this disease and tropomyosin was first acknowledged in a study that found blood serum taken from 95% of patients with ulcerative colitis contained antibodies that reacted positively to tropomyosin. Additional studies have confirmed these results, but also identify Tropomyosin 5 and Tropomyosin 1 as the primary tropomyosins involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Tropomyosin 5 has been related to the development of pouchitis in the ileal pouch following surgery for ulcerative colitis. The elevated number of IgG-producing cells in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients is largely committed to producing IgG against Tropomyosin 5-related epitopes. Tropomyosin 5 is, therefore, capable of inducing a significant T-cell response. A physicochemical analysis of common structural motifs present in 109 human autoantigens revealed that tropomyosins have the highest number of such motifs, and thus a very high propensity to act as autoantigens. In addition to the role tropomyosins play in ulcerative colitis, tropomyosin antibodies have also been reported in acute rheumatic fever and the inflammatory disorder Behcet's syndrome. In both instances, it is unclear as to whether these antibodies play a direct role in the pathogenesis of these human conditions or reflect the high antigenicity of tropomyosins released from compromised cells. =Muscle diseases= Nemaline myopathy is a muscle disease that is characterised by the presence of electron-dense rod bodies in skeletal muscle fibers. These electron-dense rod bodies are composed mainly of Œ±-actinin and actin. The disorder is often clinically categorized into several groups, including mild (typical), intermediate, severe, and adult-onset; however, these distinctions are somewhat ambiguous, as the categories frequently overlap. Causative mutations have been detected in skeletal Œ±-actinin, tropomyosin, nebulin, and troponin. Within humans, mutations in both the Œ≥-Tropomyosin and Œ≤-Tropomyosin genes have been identified. No mutations in the Œ±-Tropomyosin gene have been identified in this condition for humans. =Shellfish allergy= 'Shellfish' includes crustaceans and molluscs. Tropomyosin is the protein primarily responsible for shellfish allergy. Tools and technologies to study tropomyosins =Antibodies= Within the scientific community, there is great interest in tropomyosin isoforms, and, given the vast array of processes that this protein has been reported to be involved with, it is not surprising. One way in which this protein and, what is more important, specific isoforms can be studied in detail is through the use of antibodies. These specific antibodies can be used in protein-blotting experiments and applied to cells or tissue sections and observed under a microscope. This allows researchers not only to determine the level or concentration of an isoform or a group of isoforms but also to identify the cellular location of a particular isoform and associations with other cellular structures or proteins. At the present time, there are many commercially available antibodies; however, many of these antibodies are sold with minimal information regarding the antigen used to raise the antibody and, therefore, the isoform specificity, as such some research groups develop their own antibodies. Before these antibodies can be used, they must be extensively characterised, a process whereby the specificity of the antibody is examined to ensure that the antibody does not cross-react with other tropomyosins or other proteins.

The film follows a highly fictionalized version of San Te, a legendary Shaolin martial arts disciple who trained under the general Chi Shan. The 36th Chamber of Shaolin is widely considered to be one of the greatest kung fu films and a turning point in its director's and star's careers. It was followed by Return to the 36th Chamber, which was more comedic in presentation and featured Gordon Liu as the new main character with another actor in the smaller role of San Te, and Disciples of the 36th Chamber.  Plot  A young student named Liu Yude is drawn by his activist teacher into the local rebellion against the Manchu government. The government officials, headed by the brutal General Tien Ta, however, quickly discover and suppress the uprising, liquidating the school and killing the students' friends and family members. Yude decides to seek vengeance and liberation for the people, and heads for the Shaolin temple to learn kung fu. Wounded by Manchu henchmen during an escape, Yude reaches the temple and seeks sanctuary. Initially the monks reject him, since he is an outsider, but the chief abbot has mercy on the young man and lets him stay. One year later, Yude - now known as San Te - begins his martial arts training in the temple's 35 chambers, in each of which the temple's novices are trained in one aspect of the kung fu fighting arts. The chambers shown in San Te's training are as follows (names of the chambers, if given, are from the subtitles and in quotation marks): * \\"Top Chamber\\": This is considered the highest-level chamber, where the monks are reciting the Buddhist sutras from memory. When the head master of the chamber tells San Te to leave due to his ignorance of the sutras, San Te protests, only for the head master to knock him down from a distance. San Te flees the chamber, and agrees to start at a lower level. * \\"35th Chamber\\": This chamber teaches lightness and balance. Monks in training must jump on a bundle of sticks floating in a pool of water to reach the dining hall. Falling in the water requires the monk to dry his clothes off before entering the dining hall (by which time the food is all gone). * Third Chamber: This chamber trains arm strength. Monks must carry water in buckets with blades attached to their arms to keep the arms held straight out. The chamber also serves as the monastery's laundry. * Fourth Chamber: This chamber trains wrist strength. Monks must strike a gong with a weighted pole to the rhythm of the head master's striking his wooden fish. * Fifth Chamber: This chamber trains eyesight. Monks must follow a light without turning their heads, or risk getting burned by large sticks of incense. * Sixth Chamber: This chamber trains head strength. Monks must headbutt their way through a corridor of sandbags and then place incense sticks on an altar. This is the last conditioning chamber; after passing this chamber, San Te is allowed to learn kung fu techniques. * Seventh Chamber: This is the chamber for training empty-hand forms and techniques. * \\"Leg Chamber\\": This chamber trains kicking techniques. * \\"Sword Chamber\\": This chamber trains broadsword techniques. * Ninth Chamber: This chamber trains staff techniques. San Te advances more rapidly than any previous student, reaching the rank of deputy overseer within the space of six years. Challenged by the monastery's Discipline Chief, who thinks him unfit for his role, San Te has several exhibition matches with him, only to be beaten each time. However, after inventing the three section staff, San Te finally prevails and gains the chief abbot's permission to become overseer of one of the chambers. When San Te professes that he wants to create a new chamber where he can train ordinary people in the basics of kung fu so they can defend themselves against their oppressors, the temple officially banishes him in a surreptitious way to allow him to carry out his mission. He returns to the outside world, namely to his hometown, and assists the people, gathering several young men who loyally follow him and become his first students. Before the political revolution where his aspirations reach completion, he is forced into conflict with Tien Ta. A fierce duel ensues, where San Te is victorious. Finally, he returns to the Shaolin temple, where he establishes the 36th chamber, a special martial arts class for laypeople to learn kung fu.

The film aired on the El Rey Network in 2016, and is now available on Netflix. = Reception = 36th Chamber of Shaolin has received massive universal acclaim and is widely considered to be one of the greatest kung fu films ever made and a highly influential entry in the genre. According to the Harvard Film Archive, the film is an \\"exhilarating rendition of the legendary dissemination of the Shaolin martial arts\\" and an \\"absorbing account of [an] initiation into the vaunted Shaolin style, ... depicted here [as] an inner voyage of discovery.\\" In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. The 36th Chamber of Shaolin was listed in 22nd place on this list. Influences The Wu-Tang Clan's debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) got the latter part of its name from The 36th Chamber of Shaolin. In addition, Wu-Tang Clan member Masta Killa takes his name from one of the film's alternate titles.

Although she is recognized as the second First Lady of the Philippines, she was actually the first spouse of a Philippine president to be addressed as such, the honorific being unknown in the Philippines prior to Manuel Quezon's presidency. Much beloved by Filipinos, Quezon was known for involvement with humanitarian activities and served as the first Chairperson of the Philippine National Red Cross. Five years after her husband's death, she and her daughter \\"Baby\\" were assassinated while they were en route to open a hospital dedicated to her husband. The province of Aurora was named in her memory. Early life Do√±a Aurora Aragon- Quezon replica house (corner of San Luis and Rizal St., Poblacion, Baler, Aurora), owned by her father Pedro Arag√≥nhttp://batangbaler.net/2009/06/14/the-new-aragon-house/ Aurora Arag√≥n was born on February 19, 1888, to Pedro Arag√≥n and Zenaida Molina, in the town of Baler in Tayabas province.Filipinos in History, p. 117 During the Philippine Revolution, her father was imprisoned by the colonial authorities for being suspected as being a member of the Katipunan; he would die in captivity. Among her tutors during her youth was her mother's sister, Mar√≠a Dolores Molina, who was the mother of her first cousin and future husband Manuel Luis Quezon. After her father's imprisonment, she was taken in by her aunt Mar√≠a Dolores and uncle Lucio, and she lived for a time under the same roof as her future spouse.Filipinos in History, p. 117. \\"Quezon's mother took her under her wings. As a consequence, she became the favorite of Manuel's father. Living in the same roof, Manuel and his first cousin shared a joyful company.\\" After Manuel's own parents had died, he would stay with the Arag√≥n family whenever he was in Baler. After Pedro Arag√≥n's death, his survivors, including daughter Aurora, had been cast into extreme poverty, surviving on subsistence farming.Martinez, p. 138 This experience was said to have shaped young Aurora's lifelong attitude of according equal treatment to everybody, no matter their status in life. The Arag√≥n family later moved to Lucena where Manuel was then serving as the provincial fiscal of Tayabas.Filipinos in History, p. 118 Aurora, who had wanted to become a school teacher, enrolled at the Philippine Normal College in Manila at the expense of her future husband, but had to stop her studies after two years due to her poor health. Marriage and family Manuel In 1907, Manuel Luis Quezon was elected to the Philippine Assembly. By 1916, he was elected to the Philippine Senate and as that chamber's President. Aurora often visited Quezon in Manila. In December 1918, they were married in Hong Kong. They had four children: Mar√≠a Aurora \\"Baby\\" (September 23, 1919 ‚Äì April 28, 1949); Mar√≠a Zenaida \\"Nini\\" (April 9, 1921); Luisa Coraz√≥n Paz (February 17, 1924 ‚Äì December 14, 1924); and Manuel Lucio, Jr. \\"Nonong\\" (June 23, 1926 ‚Äì September 18, 1998). Luisa would die in infancy. The marriage lasted until Quezon's death in 1944. It withstood despite Quezon's reputation as a libertine; the author Stanley Karnow described Aurora Quezon as finding \\"solace in prayer and the Philippine law against divorce\\". Still, Aurora has also been described as \\"a devoted wife and a strict but understanding mother\\".Filipinos in History, p. 119 Quezon himself publicly extolled his wife as \\"my friend, companion and partner\\".Martinez, p. 146 Political wife and First Lady Aurora Quezon in Malaca√±an Palace Within the first seventeen years of the marriage, Manuel Quezon emerged as a dominant figure in Philippine politics. His career reached its apex in 1935, when he was elected President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. During her husband's political life, Aurora stayed in the background, involving herself with women's organizations such as the National Federation of Women's Clubs, of which she was the honorary chairperson. Time described Aurora as \\"dignified and portly\\". The Quezons were the first presidential couple to reside in Malaca√±an Palace, but she spent as little time as possible there, preferring to stay in a \\"nipa house\\" in Malaca√±ang Park or in her farm, Kaleidan, in Arayat, Pampanga. She nevertheless was an active First Lady, engaging herself in the campaign to give Filipino women the right of suffrage, which was achieved in 1937. She was particularly involved in managing the family's Arayat farm to demonstrate how social justice could be applied to landlord- tenant relationships in an agrarian setting. She was involved in the Girl Scouts of the Philippines and the Associaci√≥n de Damas Filipinas, a noted orphanage in Manila. She was also the honorary president of another orphanage, the White Cross, located in San Juan. President Quezon was re-elected in November 1941, but his presidency was immediately beset with crisis when Japan invaded the Philippines in the following month. Aurora accompanied her husband to Corregidor in December 1941, where the President was sworn in by Chief Justice Jos√© Abad Santos for his second term on December 30, 1941. For the next two months, the Quezon family remained in Corregidor where, despite the difficult living conditions, Aurora was said to have maintained her poise and kept up with a daily mass. In February 1942, they began their long journey via Australia to escape the Japanese and establish the Government in exile of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, finally reaching the United States in June 1942. While in exile, Aurora devoted her time to the care of her ailing husband, who died in Saranac, New York from tuberculosis on August 1, 1944. She then moved to California to await their return to the Philippines. She and her daughters volunteered as nurses for the Red Cross. Postwar activity When Aurora Quezon returned to the Philippines, she was voted a pension of 1,000 pesos a month by the Philippine Congress. She returned the check, explaining: \\"I feel that on account of ... countless war widows and orphans ... I should waive collection of a pension . . . I cannot, in good conscience, receive ... Government assistance when so many of my less fortunate sisters and their children are not yet taken care of. . . I know [if I accepted] I would not be keeping faith with the memory of my beloved husband. . . .\\" This act, it was said, \\"demonstrated why thousands of Filipinos regard her as a combination queen-mother and patron saint\\". Quezon was offered a slot in the Liberal Party senatorial slate for the 1946 elections, which she declined. She, however, endorsed the presidential candidacy of Manuel Roxas, who defeated her husband's vice-president and successor, Sergio Osme√±a, to win the presidency. In 1947, with the active support of Quezon, the Philippine National Red Cross was established as an independent Red Cross organization. She became the first Chairperson of the Philippine National Red Cross, holding the position until her death. She also was named as honorary vice-president of the Philippine Tuberculosis Society. She continued to be involved in civic work, such as the efforts to rebuild the Antipolo Church. She received honorary doctorates from the University of Santo Tomas, and from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. She was likewise bestowed the Ozanam Award from the Ateneo de Manila University, and the Pro Ecclessia et Pontifice Cross from Pope Pius XII. Assassination On the morning of April 28, 1949, Quezon left her home to travel to her husband's hometown of Baler to open the Quezon Memorial Hospital. She had been cautioned about this trip beforehand due to the frequent insurgency activities in Central Luzon of the Hukbalahap, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines. She shrugged off the threat, remarking on the morning of the trip, \\"[Hukbalahap Supremo] Taruc knows my white hair and he will not hurt me.\\"Martinez, p. 149 Nonetheless, a convoy of thirteen vehicles, including two military jeeps full of armed soldiers, accompanied Quezon.Martinez, p. 148 Together with Quezon in her Buick sedan were her daughter \\"Baby\\", then a law student at the University of Santo Tomas, her son-in-law Felipe \\"Philip\\" Buencamino (husband of \\"Nini\\"), Quezon City mayor Ponciano Bernardo and retired Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Rafael Jalandoni. They traveled along the Baler-Bongabon Road connecting Baler with Nueva Ecija, which Quezon herself inaugurated in 1940. At Quezon's request, her vehicle led the caravan, and it soon sped away from the military jeep immediately behind it. As Quezon's vehicle traversed the mountain road, it was blocked by a group of armed men.Martinez, p. 150 The men ignored the protestations from General Jalandoni and Mayor Bernardo that Quezon was in the vehicle, and machine-gun fire erupted from the side of the road and from the mountain slopes. It was later estimated that between 100 and 200 armed men had participated in the attack. Mrs. Quezon, her daughter, and Bernardo were killed instantly, while her son-in-law was mortally wounded. The soldiers in the convoy soon arrived at the scene and exchanged fire with the assailants, who were able to seize the valuables of the victims before fleeing the scene. In all, twelve members of the Quezon party and ten of the assailants were killed. Manuel Quezon and his wife Aurora at Museo ni Quezon, Quezon Memorial Circle, Quezon City Quezon Memorial in Quezon City. There was national and international condemnation of the massacre. United States President Harry Truman was shocked and simply declared, \\"It was awful.\\"Martinez, p. 151 A nine-day national mourning period was declared, and President Elpidio Quirino openly wept during the funeral. Quezon was buried at Manila North Cemetery. The mourners included her two surviving children, Manuel, Jr., and Nini, who herself was widowed by the massacre. While no Philippine President has ever been assassinated, Aurora Quezon is one of three presidential spouses to have been murdered. (The other two were Alicia Syquia- Quirino and Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., both of whom died before their spouses were elected president.) It was widely believed that the Hukbalahap was responsible for the killings. In preparation of the attack, the insurgents had blockaded the road and rounded up passengers from passing vehicles, and one of those passengers claimed seeing a former employee of his who had joined the Huk as among the armed men. While General Jalandoni, who survived the attack, tagged the Huks as responsible, the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary laid blame instead on bandits. President Quirino blamed the Huks and responded by calling for \\"a people's war on the dissidents\\".Martinez, p. 152 Luis Taruc, Supremo of the Hukbalahap, denied that his group was responsible for the crime, though he also claimed that the Huk were conducting an investigation of their own if one of the group had breached ranks and participated in the killing. Nonetheless, after Taruc's surrender in 1954, he was formally charged for the murder of Quezon and other members of her party; these charges would be dropped before they could be heard on trial. Throughout the 1950s, several other captured Huk members would be charged for participation in the assassination, with five of them being sentenced to death by a Cabanatuan City trial court. Luis Taruc later wrote the killings were discussed as an agenda item at the Dec. 1949 to Jan. 1950 Politburo meeting,\\"...the accidental killing in a Huk ambush of Mrs. Quezon, widow of the late President Quezon, and her daughter. The majority took a characteristic Communist attitude toward this deplorable event. The victims had been 'class enemies', and that settled everything.\\"Taruc, L., 1967, He Who Rides the Tiger, London: Geoffrey Chapman Ltd. On April 28, 2005, exactly fifty-six years after her death, the remains of Quezon were transferred from North Cemetery for interment in a black crypt beside her husband's sarcophagus at the Quezon Memorial in Quezon City. The re-interment rites were attended by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the Quezons' sole surviving child, Zenaida \\"Nini\\" Quezon-Avance√±a. Legacy Aurora Boulevard The Manila Provincial Road that traverses Quezon City to Manila was renamed Aurora Boulevard in her honor in 1951. In the same year, Elpidio Quirino created the Aurora sub-province comprising Baler and surrounding areas in the adjacent Quezon Province. In 1978, Aurora became a separate province. Manuel and Aurora Quezon are the only spouses to have respective provinces in the Philippines named after them.Martinez, p. 147 The first major building erected on Aurora Boulevard (also called Aurora Avenue), that is, the Aurora Tower at the Araneta Center in Cubao, was named after her. Her foremost legacy in the field of education was Mount Carmel College of Baler (formerly called Mount Carmel High School), a Catholic mission school founded in 1948 by American Carmelite missionaries who came to this town upon her invitation. The Concerned Women of the Philippines named the Aurora Aragon Quezon Peace Awards after her. Aurora A. Quezon elementary school at San Andres Malate, Manila is also named for her. According to folktales, Do√±a Aurora Quezon wished to have a flower entitled to her, thus the 'Do√±a Aurora' (Mussaenda philippica) flower.

It is the oldest functioning temple in the country.  History  The temple site was founded since the era of Dutch Malacca by the Chinese Kapitan of Tay Kie Ki @ Tay Hong Yong in 1645. Additional structures was then constructed in 1673 under the led of Kapitan Li Wei King @ Koon Chang with materials imported from China. The temple served as the main place of worship for the local Hoklo (Hokkien) community. Kapitan Chan Ki Lock construct a main hall for the temple in 1704. In 1801, the temple structures was renovated under the led of Kapitan Chua Su Cheong @ Tok Ping who is the father of Choa Chong Long, the first Kapitan of Singapore, with the addition of additional structures. In 1962, then abbot Seck Kim Seng ordained Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a Zen nun from England and the future founder of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives, at this temple. The temple was awarded a UNESCO award for outstanding architectural restoration in 2003.  Features  The temple is situated close to Jalan Tukang Emas, also known as \\"Harmony Street\\" because of its proximity to the Kampung Kling Mosque and Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, covering an area of 4,600 m2. Featuring a magnificent main gate along Jalan Tokong, the temple consists of a complex of several prayer halls with a large main prayer hall dedicated to the goddess of mercy, Guan Yin. Additional smaller prayer quarters were added later. One of these is dedicated to the Buddhist gods of wealth, longevity and propagation, while another houses ancestral tablets. One of the main features of the temple is the seven-metre red flag-pole facing the left wing of the main prayer hall, which houses the remains of two of the three Kapitans who contributed to the construction of the temple. Across the road is a traditional opera theatre which forms a part of the temple complex. The building conforms to the principles of feng shui where the complex is laid out to ensure a view of the river and high ground on either side.

Kappa has a total membership of more than 260,000 women, with 140 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada and 307 alumnae associations worldwide. Kappa Kappa Gamma is considered a women's fraternity because it was founded before the term \\"sorority\\" was created, but is commonly referred to as a sorority because it only admits women. The fraternity is a founding member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), an umbrella organization that includes 26 American sororities. History 530 E. Town St. headquarters, 1952-2018 In 1869, two Monmouth College students, Mary Louise Bennett and Hannah Jeannette Boyd, were dissatisfied with the fact that, while men enjoyed membership in fraternities, women had few equivalent organizations for companionship, support, and advancement, and were instead limited to literary societies. Bennett and Boyd decided to create a women's fraternity and sought members \\"not only for literary work, but also for social development\\", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.Tessier, Denise, \\"History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years\\". 2000 Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members, to plan their new society.William Urban et al., Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century. Monmouth College, 1979 They recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.The left The six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on establishing the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. They chose a golden key as their badge and had badges crafted by Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter for the fraternity was drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth Chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted to recognize October 13, 1870 as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined. In 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby St. Mary's Seminary. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at Indiana University. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was temporarily closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years. In 1882, Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly journal,The Key. Today, it is published triennially through Watkins Printing Company. In 1890, the Beta Alpha chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma became the first sorority at the University of Pennsylvania, led by president Martha Bunting = Moves Toward Panhellenic = In 1891, Kappa Kappa Gamma invited the other women's fraternities to Boston for a discussion on the challenges they collectively faced ‚Äì thus the precursor to the National Panhellenic Conference. However, no major movements occurred from this meeting, and none would occur for another decade when Alpha Phi invited Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Chi Omega, and Chi Omega to a conference in Chicago on May 24, 1902, to set standards for collegiate sororities. This meeting resulted in the organization of the first inter- fraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses. In the 1960s, G. William Domhoff, writing in Who Rules America?, listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of \\"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\\" From 1929 to 1952, the organization was headquartered in the Law and Finance Building in Downtown Columbus, Ohio. In 1952, Kappa Kappa Gamma purchased its first headquarters at 530 East Town Street, now part of the East Town Street Historic District. On January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved from the building to 6640 Riverside Drive in Dublin, Ohio. Symbols Kappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the owl as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the fleur-de-lis, combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the iris is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue sapphire. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity Coat of Arms combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva. Kappa Kappa Gamma used \\"Tradition of Leadership\\" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to \\"Aspire to Be\\". In June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line \\"Dream Boldly, Live Fully\\". =Badges= The badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with sapphires, pearls or diamonds. On the front of the key are the Greek letters ŒöŒöŒì (on the stem) and ŒëŒ©Œü (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as opals. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership by initiated members. The fraternity encourages badges to be returned to the headquarters upon a member's death. New, uninitiated members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge, which is a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the initiating chapter.  Programs  =Philanthropy= Kappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as \\"Philanthropy 1-2-3\\". * The first branch of philanthropy supports the \\"Kappa family\\" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need. * The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions. * The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, Reading is Fundamental (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004. Local KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually. =Leadership= Collegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers. The national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio. In 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an outdoor education facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at Heartland Conference Retreat Center in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters. =The Monmouth Duo= The women's fraternity Pi Beta Phi was founded as I.C. Sorosis at Monmouth College in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called \\"The Monmouth Duo\\". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events. Controversies =Hazing= In 1997 the television show 20/20 featured an expos√© on hazing in the sorority system that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at DePauw University and a local sorority Lambda Delta Sigma at Concordia College. The three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, on November 6, 1997, were accused of branding three pledges with cigarettes in a family hazing rite after a night of heavy drinking. After being burned, the pledges were encouraged to streak across campus and to grovel for cigarettes at a fraternity house. The result was severe enough to send one of the pledges to the hospital with minor burn injuries. The discovery of the incident caused investigations by the sorority and campus to be launched. The members who were involved with the incident were not charged by the state of Indiana with criminal recklessness under the hazing statute, as had been reported. They did, however, face a possible trial for alcohol possession but due to difficulty proving who provided the alcohol, the members were given community service instead. DePauw's reaction to the hazing for the chapter was to put the chapter on social probation until Fall 1999 and cut its pledge class in half for two years. The thirteen members who had either been involved with the incident or had known about it were given one-semester suspensions and social probation for their participation, and were voted by their chapter to retain membership within the chapter. In 2014, the Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter at the University of Connecticut was kicked off campus until 2017 for forcing pledges to drink until they passed out, act like animals, and wiggle on the floor like \\"sizzling bacon\\". In 2015, the Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter at The Ohio State University was suspended for initiation rituals that involved heavy consumptions of alcohol.http://wcbe.org/post/osu- sorority-suspended-amid-hazing-allegations =Bruce Ivins= Bruce Ivins, the senior bio-defense researcher at United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), before allegedly being driven to suicide by the allegations that he was the \\"sole perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax attacks\\", reportedly had a \\"long and strange obsession\\" with Kappa Kappa Gamma, as well as with other sororities such as Chi Omega. Ivins reportedly became obsessed with Kappa when he was rebuffed by a woman in the sorority during his days as a student at the University of Cincinnati. The letters containing anthrax spores (which eventually killed 5 people and injured dozens more) were mailed from a drop box approximately 300 feet from a KKG storage facility at Princeton University, and only 60 feet from the KKG office. A US Government investigative panel, called the Expert Behavioral Analysis Panel, issued a report in March 2011 which detailed more of Ivins' obsession with the sorority. According to the panel's report, Ivins tormented sorority member Nancy Haigwood at the University of North Carolina. Ivins stole her notebook, which documented her research for her doctoral studies, and vandalized her residence. Membership University of Illinois chapter house, listed in the National Register of Historic Places In order to join Kappa Kappa Gamma, potential new members (PNMs) must be enrolled at a college or university with an active chapter of the fraternity. They must also have a minimum grade point average to be considered eligible. Women must participate in sorority recruitment and if they are issued an invitation to join, they enter the New Member period, the first of three phases of membership. After six to eight weeks, New Members are initiated and enter the second phase of membership as active collegiate members. Upon graduation, members enter the third and final phase of membership and become alumnae. Alumnae have the opportunity to join local alumna associations and remain active participants in fraternity life by engaging in social and philanthropic events, volunteering as advisers to collegiate chapters, and serving as fraternity council officers. =Collegiate chapters= * Kappa Kappa Gamma has chartered a total of 161 chapters, 30 of which the fraternity has closed.

Fellow students and friends there included Victor Willing, Keith Sutton, Diana Cumming, Euan Uglow and Craigie Aitchison. In 1953 he spent six months in Italy after receiving a Rome Scholarship in Painting. From 1958 he taught at the Slade and Chelsea School of Art. He held a fellowship at the Digswell Arts Trust between February 1958 and June 1960, in that period he shared a studio with Patrick Swift. In 1959 his painting A Man Who Suddenly Fell Over was acquired by the Tate Gallery. In the 1960s he painted works showing parties; later, the \\"Lights\\" series presented views from the air. Andrews was much impressed by a visit to Ayers Rock in 1983, but the works he produced toward the end of his life are of scenes from Scotland and London. In 1981 he moved to the village of Saxlingham Nethergate in his home county of Norfolk. He was a member of the Norwich Twenty Group. He painted Sax AD 832Sax AD 832 Retrieved 14 November 2007 in 1982 to celebrate 1,150 years of the village's history.

Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being banned or penalized on major search engines either temporarily or permanently.Irrelevant keywords, Google Keyword Quality Guidelines The repetition of words in meta tags may explain why many search engines no longer use these tags. Nowadays, search engines focus more on the content that is unique, comprehensive, relevant, and helpful that overall makes the quality better which makes keyword stuffing useless, but it is still practiced by many webmasters. Many major search engines have implemented algorithms that recognize keyword stuffing, and reduce or eliminate any unfair search advantage that the tactic may have been intended to gain, and oftentimes they will also penalize, demote or remove websites from their indexes that implement keyword stuffing. Changes and algorithms specifically intended to penalize or ban sites using keyword stuffing include the Google Florida update (November 2003) Google Panda (February 2011)The Panda That Hates Farms: A Q&A; With Google‚Äôs Top Search Engineers, Wired.com, March 3, 2011 Google Hummingbird (August 2013)All About the New Google \\"Hummingbird\\" Update, SearchEngineLand.com.com, September 26, 2013 and Bing's September 2014 update.Bing URL Stuffing Spam Filtering, Bing.com Blogs, September 10, 2014 History Keyword stuffing had been used in the past to obtain top search engine rankings and visibility for particular phrases. This method is outdated and adds no value to rankings today. In particular, Google no longer gives good rankings to pages employing this technique. Hiding text from the visitor is done in many different ways. Text colored to blend with the background, CSS \\"Z\\" positioning to place text \\"behind\\" an image ‚Äî and therefore out of view of the visitor ‚Äî and CSS absolute positioning to have the text positioned far from the page center are all common techniques. By 2005, many invisible text techniques were easily detected by major search engines. \\"Noscript\\" tags are another way to place hidden content within a page. While they are a valid optimization method for displaying an alternative representation of scripted content, they may be abused, since search engines may index content that is invisible to most visitors. Sometimes inserted text includes words that are frequently searched (such as \\"sex\\"), even if those terms bear little connection to the content of a page, in order to attract traffic to advert- driven pages. In the past, keyword stuffing was considered to be either a white hat or a black hat tactic, depending on the context of the technique, and the opinion of the person judging it. While a great deal of keyword stuffing was employed to aid in spamdexing, which is of little benefit to the user, keyword stuffing in certain circumstances was not intended to skew results in a deceptive manner. Whether the term carries a pejorative or neutral connotation is dependent on whether the practice is used to pollute the results with pages of little relevance, or to direct traffic to a page of relevance that would have otherwise been de-emphasized due to the search engine's inability to interpret and understand related ideas. This is no longer the case. Search engines now employ themed, related keyword techniques to interpret the intent of the content on a page. In online journalism Headlines in online news sites are increasingly packed with just the search- friendly keywords that identify the story. Puns and plays on words have gone by the wayside. Overusing this strategy is also called keyword stuffing. Traditional reporters and editors frown on the practice, but it is effective in optimizing news stories for search.On Language, The Web Is At War With Itself, Linton Weeks, for National Public Radio, July 15, 2010.

The four structures are the busiest multi-span bridge crossing in North America, surpassing the Brooklyn Bridge. Don Valley in Toronto is the busiest multi-structure bridge in North America, surpassing the Brooklyn Bridge  Description  The Hoggs Hollow Bridge has a 14-lane cross section: 6 collector lanes, 8 express lanes. The road surface and bridge decks require constant maintenance due to the wear and tear from high traffic volumes. Since 2001, an Ontario tall-wall concrete barrier has replaced the steel guide‚Äìrail in the median separating eastbound and westbound traffic. The late 1960s conventional truss lights have been replaced by high-mast lighting. Starting from 2002, the westbound collector lanes on the outer north bridge have also undergone rehabilitation (replacing road surface, guard rails and/or concrete barriers). The westbound collector traffic has been rehabilitated; the project included the north side outer bridge and the Yonge Street overpass. Additional high mast lighting was added in late 2009. From 2006 to 2008, the eastbound collector lanes were rebuilt and the reconstruction stretched from east of Avenue Road all the way to Bayview Avenue, encompassing the south side outer bridge and Yonge Street overpass. This did not include the on‚Äìramp junction with Lord Seaton Road. The inner eastbound express lanes will be next on the reconstruction process. Once completed, the entire bridge will use the Ontario tall-wall barrier system. Due to land constraints of the Valley and the need to accommodate the bridges, the adjacent interchange with Yonge Street is of a modified Parclo design instead of the typical Parclo A4 configuration used on most Ontario freeway junctions. The interchange is also one of the narrower points of Highway 401's collector-express system, not just because of the bridges but also because of the suburbs east of Yonge Street (which forced the province to expropriate land in order to expand that segment of Highway 401). Although there are a total of 14 lanes of traffic on the four bridges, there are only 12 through lanes that cross Yonge Street, as the off‚Äìramps and on‚Äìramps default onto the main lanes instead of being additional deceleration and acceleration lanes. At the foot of the bridges is the Earl Bales Park and Ski Centre in the north and Don Valley Golf Course to the south, both owned by the City of Toronto. An access road branches off from the westbound on-ramp and travels downward to the valley below and ends in a cul-de-sac just south of the eastbound collector lanes. It is closed to regular vehicular traffic and used by Ontario Ministry of Transportation maintenance crews (and their contractors) as well as housing the Macdonald-Cartier Emergency Service building of the Toronto Transit Commission used for both emergency access to/from track level of the subway but also as an access point for maintenance crews. The bridges can be clearly seen from Yonge Street looking northwest and north of York Mills Road and Wilson Avenue.  History  The inner under deck truss bridge was constructed beginning in early 1928, and opened on January 5, 1929, providing a much needed bypass of the deep ravine. It also provided a path between Wilson Avenue and York Mills Road. Wilson Avenue's eastern limit was just east of Yonge Boulevard (it was extended to meet York Mills at Yonge St. after 1972). The collector road merged traffic from both Avenue Road and Yonge Boulevard to the bridge to Yonge Street. The Toronto Bypass, today's Highway 401, was routed over the bridge (with an additional south truss bridge added) in December 1952. The collector (outermost) spans are steel girder bridges, and were opened in December 1965 during the widening of Highway 401 to a collector-express system. The older inner bridge's balustrade railing was replaced with retaining walls (since replaced with tall walls). A conventional lighting system with truss-neck poles was added to the bridges (and the rest of the widened 401) around this time. = Bridge rehabilitation = Hoggs Hollow Bridge is situated on what is considered to be the most sensitive segment of Highway 401, averaging around 400,000 vehicles a day on weekdays. Given the importance of this segment of Highway 401 through the GTA, the Ministry of Transportation was particularly concerned with the development of construction staging plans and the mitigation of traffic during the rehabilitation of the Hoggs Hollow Bridge. \\"The impact of delays on passenger and commercial traffic resulting from construction activities on this section of highway were an important consideration,\\" says Ron Klatt, Department Manager, Contract Administration Group with Morrison Hershfield Ltd., the engineering and management company that designed the project. In 2008, Morrison Hershfield was retained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) as the lead consultant for a Total Project Management (TPM) Detailed Design assignment for the rehabilitation of Highway 401 at Hoggs Hollow Bridge. This is deemed to be the most complex portion of the Ministry‚Äôs 401 Strategic Rehabilitation Program. Morrison Hershfield carried out the structural rehabilitation of a total of 12 structures including complete deck replacements at the Hoggs Hollow Bridge, rehabilitation of the pavement structure including concrete base repairs, and was responsible for extensive construction staging and traffic management over multiple construction seasons including provision for winter staging and construction shutdown. The rehabilitation of Hoggs Hollow Bridge is estimated to be an $86-million construction project. Barricade Traffic Services Inc. were in charge of traffic control. The safety needs of the traveling public and workers within the construction zone were met, with minimal disruption to commuters and commercial carriers. Work on the Hoggs Hollow Bridge saw most of the lane closures required done at night to minimize congestion on Canada‚Äôs busiest section of highway. The impact of delays on traffic from construction activities on this section of the highway would have been significant if it was not for the detailed construction staging plans and the planned mitigation of traffic impacts that were in place prior to the beginning of the bridge rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of Hoggs Hollow Bridge was completed in 2012 with transfer from collectors to express restored full access to all lanes in both directions.

Life Genette was born in Paris, where he studied at the Lyc√©e Lakanal and the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, University of Paris. After leaving the French Communist Party, Genette was a member of Socialisme ou Barbarie during 1957‚Äì8. He received his professorship in French literature at the Sorbonne in 1967. In 1970 with H√©l√®ne Cixous and Tzvetan Todorov he founded the journal Po√©tique and he edited a series of the same name for √âditions du Seuil. Among other positions, Genette was research director at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales and a visiting professor at Yale University. Work Genette is largely responsible for the reintroduction of a rhetorical vocabulary into literary criticism, for example such terms as trope and metonymy. Additionally his work on narrative, best known in English through the selection Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method, has been of importance. His major work is the multi-part Figures series, of which Narrative Discourse is a section. His trilogy on textual transcendence, which has also been quite influential, is composed of Introduction √† l'architexte (1979), Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree (1982), and Paratexts. Thresholds of Interpretation (1997).Macksey, Richard (1997) Foreword to Genette Paratexts, p.xiii, note 3 His international influence is not as great as that of some others identified with structuralism, such as Roland Barthes and Claude L√©vi-Strauss; his work is more often included in selections or discussed in secondary works than studied in its own right. Terms and techniques originating in his vocabulary and systems have, however, become widespread, such as the term paratext for prefaces, introductions, illustrations or other material accompanying the text, or hypotext for the sources of the text. Important concepts in Genette's narratology This outline of Genette's narratology is derived from Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method. This book forms part of his multi-volume work Figures I-III. The examples used in it are mainly drawn from Proust's epic In Search of Lost Time. One criticism which had been used against previous forms of narratology was that they could deal only with simple stories, such as Vladimir Propp's work in Morphology of the Folk Tale. If narratology could cope with Proust, this could no longer be said. Below are the five main concepts used by Genette in Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method. They are primarily used to look at the syntax of narratives, rather than to perform an interpretation of them. =Order= Say a story is narrated as follows: the clues of a murder are discovered by a detective (event A); the circumstances of the murder are finally revealed (event B); and lastly the murderer is caught (event C). Add corresponding numbers to the lettered events that represent their order chronologically: 1, 2, and 3. If these events were described chronologically, they would run B1, A2, C3. Arranged in the text, however, they run A2 (discovery), B1 (flashback), C3 (resolution). This accounts for the 'obvious' effects the reader will recognise, such as flashback. It also deals with the structure of narratives on a more systematic basis, accounting for flash- forward, simultaneity, as well as possible, if rarely used, effects. These disarrangements on the level of order are termed 'anachrony'. =Frequency= The separation between an event and its narration allows several possibilities. *An event can occur once and be narrated once (singular). ** 'Today I went to the shop.' *An event can occur many times and be narrated once (iterative). ** 'I used to go to the shop.' *An event can occur once and be narrated many times (repetitive). ** 'Today I went to the shop' + 'Today he went to the shop' etc. *An event can occur many times and be narrated many times (multiple). ** 'I used to go to the shop' + 'He used to go to the shop' + 'I went to the shop yesterday' etc. =Duration= The separation between an event and its narration means that there is discourse time and narrative time. These are the two main elements of duration. *\\"Five years passed\\", has a lengthy narrative time, five years, but a short discourse time (it only took a second to read). *James Joyce's novel Ulysses has a relatively short narrative time, twenty-four hours. Not many people, however, could read Ulysses in twenty-four hours. Thus it is safe to say it has a lengthy discourse time. =Voice= Voice is concerned with who narrates, and from where. This can be split four ways. *Where the narration is from ** Intra-diegetic: inside the text. e.g. Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White ** Extra-diegetic: outside the text. e.g. Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles *Is the narrator a character in the story? ** Hetero-diegetic: the narrator is not a character in the story. e.g. Homer's The Odyssey ** Homo-diegetic: the narrator is a character in the story. e.g. Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights =Mode= Genette said narrative mode is dependent on the 'distance' and 'perspective' of the narrator, and like music, narrative mode has predominant patterns. It is related to voice. Distance of the narrator changes with narrated speech, transposed speech and reported speech. Perspective of the narrator is called focalization. Narratives can be non-focalized, internally focalized or externally focalized.

The Paxton Boys were frontiersman of Scottish Ulster Protestants origin from along the Susquehanna River in central Pennsylvania who formed a vigilante group to retaliate in 1763 against local American Indians in the aftermath of the French and Indian War and Pontiac's War. They are widely known for murdering 20 Susquehannock in events collectively called the Conestoga Massacre. The creation of the Paxton Boys was a culmination of anger from Pontiac's rebellion, and the lack of action taken by the Pennsylvania government. Although the Paxton Boys were violent and hostile, the state of Pennsylvania in which they reside was known as a Quaker state, and Quakers are known to have a very pacifist worldview. Following attacks on the Conestoga, in January 1764 about 250 Paxton Boys marched to Philadelphia to present their grievances to the legislature. Met by leaders in Germantown, they agreed to disperse on the promise by Benjamin Franklin that their issues would be considered. Attack on Susquehannock 1841 lithograph of the Paxton Boys' massacre of the Indians at Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1763. In the aftermath of the French and Indian War, no Europeans had yet settled in the frontier of Pennsylvania. A new wave of Scots-Irish immigrants encroached on Native American land in the backcountry often in blatant violation of previously signed treaties. These settlers claimed that Indians often raided their homes, killing men, women and children. Reverend John Elder, who was the parson at Paxtang, became a leader of the settlers. He was known as the \\"Fighting Parson\\" and kept his rifle in the pulpit while he delivered his sermons. Elder helped organize the settlers into a mounted militia and was named captain of the group, known as the \\"Pextony boys.\\" Although there had been no Indian attacks in the area, the Paxton Boys claimed that the Conestoga secretly provided aid and intelligence to the hostiles. At daybreak on December 14, 1763, a vigilante group of the Scots-Irish frontiersmen attacked Conestoga homes at Conestoga Town (near present-day Millersville), murdered six, and burned their cabins. The Susquehannock tribe had lived on the land which was ceded by William Penn to their ancestors in the 1690s. Many Conestoga were Christian, and they had lived peacefully with their European neighbors for decades. They lived by bartering handicrafts, hunting, and from subsistence food given to them by the Pennsylvania government. Because of a snowstorm, most of the Conestogas had been unable to reach home the previous evening and spent the night with neighbors. Those at the camp were scalped, or otherwise mutilated, and their huts were set on fire. Most of the camp burned down. The colonial government held an inquest and determined that the killings were murder. The new governor, John Penn offered a reward for capture of the Paxton Boys. Penn placed the remaining sixteen Conestoga in protective custody in Lancaster but the Paxton Boys broke in on December 27, 1763. They killed, scalped and dismembered six adults and eight children. The government of Pennsylvania offered a new reward after this second attack, this time $600, for the capture of anyone involved. The attackers were never identified. Many of the residents of where they lived had sympathy towards the paxton boys and their efforts, therefore no prosecutions were put into act. The Rev. Elder, who was not directly implicated in either attack, wrote to Governor Penn, on January 27, 1764: March on Philadelphia In January 1764, the Paxton Boys marched toward Philadelphia with about 250 men to challenge the government for failing to protect them. Benjamin Franklin led a group of civic leaders to meet them in Germantown, then a separate settlement northwest of the city, and hear their grievances. After the leaders agreed to read the men's pamphlet of issues before the colonial legislature, the mob agreed to disperse. Many colonists were outraged about the December killings of innocent Conestoga, describing the murders as more savage than those committed by Indians. Benjamin Franklin's \\"Narrative of the Late Massacres\\" concluded with noting that the Conestoga would have been safe among any other people on earth, no matter how primitive, except \\"'white savages' from Peckstang and Donegall!\\"Silver, Peter. Our Savage Neighbors, p. 203 Lazarus Stewart, a former leader of the Paxton Boys, was killed by Iroquois warriors in the Wyoming Massacre in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. In the Wyoming Valley event, one of three famous massacres during many scattered Tory- Amerindian staged attacks on colonial settlements that year in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, Mohawk chief Joseph Brant led a group of Loyalists, Mohawk and other warriors against rebel colonial settlers in the area along the North Branch Susquehanna River. The raids resulted in the Sullivan Expedition the next year which effectively broke the power of the Six Nations of the Iroquois below Canada; and forced the British Colonial powers in Canada to shelter the Amerindians they'd incited into the attacks.

Its Broadway premiere, directed by Arthur Hopkins, is considered one of the highpoints of Expressionist theatre on the American stage. Synopsis A young woman works as a low-level stenographer and lives with her mother. She follows the rituals that society expects of a woman, however resistant she may feel about them. She subsequently marries her boss, whom she finds repulsive. After having a baby with him, she has an affair with a younger man who fuels her lust for life. Driven to murder her husband, she is convicted of the crime and is executed in the electric chair. Production Produced and directed by Arthur Hopkins, Machinal opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on September 7, 1928, and closed on November 24, 1928, after 91 performances. The scenic design was by Robert Edmond Jones, who used an open stage with a permanent background and made scene changes primarily with lighting. The play is presented in two parts, with ten scenes in the first and four in the second. The production is notable for featuring Clark Gable in his Broadway debut. =Cast= * Zita Johann as A Young Woman * Millicent Green as A Telephone Girl * Grace Atwell as A Stenographer * Leopold Badia as A Filing Clerk * Conway Washburn as An Adding Clerk and A Reporter * Jean Adair as A Mother * George Stillwell as A Husband * Otto Frederick as A Bellboy and A Court Reporter * Nancy Allan as A Nurse * Monroe Childs as A Doctor * Hal K.

Reception \\"It was unfortunate that word was sent broadcast before the first performance of Machinal that its theme and characters grew out of the notorious Snyder-Gray murder case,\\" wrote Perriton Maxwell, editor of Theatre Magazine. \\"The play bears no likeness to the sordid facts of that cheap tragedy ‚Ä¶ Machinal transcends the drab drama of the police court; it has a quality one finds it difficult to define, a beauty that cannot be conveyed in words, an aliveness and reality tinctured with poetic pathos which lift it to the realm of great art, greatly conceived and greatly presented.\\" Calling Machinal \\"the most enthralling play of the year,\\" Maxwell attributed the play's success to \\"three remarkable persons: Sophie Treadwell, Arthur Hopkins and Zita Johann.\\" \\"From the sordid mess of a brutal murder the author, actors and producer of Machinal ‚Ä¶ have with great skill managed to retrieve a frail and sombre beauty of character,\\" wrote theatre critic Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times. \\"Subdued, monotonous, episodic, occasionally eccentric in its style, Machinal is fraught with a beauty unfamiliar to the stage.\\" Atkinson describes the play as \\"the tragedy of one who lacks strength; she is not adaptable; she submits. ‚Ä¶ Being the exposition of a character, stark and austere in style, Machinal makes no excuses for the tragedy it unfolds.\\" Adaptations Adapted for television by Irving Gaynor Neiman, Machinal was presented January 18, 1954, on NBC-TV's Robert Montgomery Presents. Reviewing the starring performance of Joan Lorring, Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote that \\"her interpretation of the mentally tortured young woman in Machinal, Sophie Treadwell's expressionistic and bitter poem for the theatre, must rank among the video season's finest accomplishments.\\" The cast also included Malcolm Lee Beggs as the husband. An adaptation of Machinal aired August 14, 1960, on ITV the United Kingdom in the ABC Armchair Theatre series. Joanna Dunham starred, with Donald Pleasence portraying the husband.

Munro (1919‚Äì1942), the only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Douglas Munro was commissioned on September 27, 1971, at Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, Louisiana. The tenth of twelve cutters, she was the first to be named after a Coast Guard hero. The previously commissioned 378-footers had been named for former secretaries of the Treasury, a tradition that began in 1830 when a cutter was named for Alexander Hamilton. Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe and Douglas Munro's mother, Edith, were on hand to commission Douglas Munro. The ship's original complement included 17 officers and 143 enlisted men, under the command of the ship's first commanding officer, Captain John T. Rouse. 1970s The dedication of the ship took place on April 15, 1972, at Douglas Munros first homeport of Boston, Massachusetts. Secretary Volpe attended the ceremony. The first commanding officer was Captain John T. Rouse. While operating out of Boston, the ship's original missions included ocean station patrol and search and rescue. The stay in Boston was not to last long, however, as Douglas Munro shifted to a new homeport of Seattle, Washington, on August 29, 1973. The Seattle Post- Intelligencer hailed the arrival of \\"Two (Douglas Munro and ) of the newest, finest ships in the Coast Guard fleet.\\" Seattle was also especially receptive to Douglas Munro because Douglas Munro himself had been a resident of Cle Elum, a small town in Washington State. While operating out of Seattle, Douglas Munro became more active in the fisheries enforcement mission and less active in the ocean station mission, which was quickly being made obsolete by technological advances. Alaskan fisheries were especially busy and controversial at this time. In 1971, for instance, the combined Japanese, Russian, Canadian, and South Korean fishing fleets had caught about ten times as many fish as the U.S. fleet did. Coast Guard action was badly needed to regulate the practices of these foreign fleets. Douglas Munro performed this mission with great success, including the seizure of the Korean longliner Dong Won No. 51 in June 1979. 1980s In 1980, the ship moved to yet another new homeport: Honolulu, Hawaii. While conducting training with the Japan Coast Guard in 1983 Douglas Munro was called upon to aid in the rescue and salvage operations for Korean Air Flight 007 in the Sea of Japan. In 1986, Douglas Munro interdicted the motor vessel Line Island Trader, which had been attempting to enter the U.S. with 4.5 tons of marijuana. Later that same year, the ship underwent an extensive three-year Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. Weapons systems were upgraded and many portions of the cutter were remodeled. Upon being re-commissioned in November 1989, Munro was homeported at Coast Guard Island in Alameda, California. 1990s and 2000s In 1997, the cutter seized the Russian fishing trawler Chernyayevo in the Bering Sea for violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976, setting an important precedent for law enforcement along the U.S./Russia maritime boundary. In 1998, Douglas Munro intercepted the Chinese vessel Chih Yung, carrying 172 people attempting to illegally enter the U.S. In 1999, the cutter interdicted the fishing vessel Eduardo I, carrying 83 illegal Ecuadorian migrants. Also in 1998, Douglas Munro interdicted the Mexican vessel Xolescuintle, seizing 11.5 tons of cocaine, one of the largest drug seizures in Coast Guard history. In 1999, the cutter seized the motor vessel Wing Fung Lung, carrying 259 illegal Chinese migrants. In 2003, the cutter interdicted the fishing vessel Candy I with 4 tons of cocaine. In 2003, the cutter interdicted two \\"go-fast\\" boats with 2 tons of cocaine using warning shots across the bow of one with an MH-68 \\"Stingray\\" Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON). The other was dead reckoned based on its course and speed while Douglas Munro was on turbines for 16 hours before interdicting the second. The second \\"go-fast\\" then proceeded to light itself on fire to destroy the bales on board the vessel, but Douglas Munros crew quickly sank the vessel and later recovered approx 139 bales of cocaine. Four traffickers were recovered with two needing medical assistance from Douglas Munros corpsman. From December 2004 to June 2005, Douglas Munro operated in the Persian Gulf with the Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group. During the Out of Hemisphere patrol Douglas Munro contributed in the relief efforts of the 2004 tsunami providing food and water to Indonesia and later seizing a vessel overtaken by pirates off the Horn of Africa. In 2006 the cutter interdicted two \\"go-fast\\" boats working in tandem with 2 tons of cocaine using disabling shots with an MH-68 \\"Stingray\\" HITRON. As of September 4, 2007, Douglas Munro was home-ported in Kodiak, Alaska. On March 23, 2008, Douglas Munro rescued survivors of FV Alaska Ranger when it sank west of Dutch Harbor.National Transportation Safety Board Maritime Accident Report. 2009. \\"Sinking of U. S. Fish Processing Vessel Alaska Ranger, Bering Sea, March 23, 2008.\\" NTSB/MAR-09/05. Washington, DC. Archived from the original on 2011-10-22. Douglas Munro deployed its HH-65 Dolphin helicopter to the sinking site, and received 20 of the surviving fishermen. The story of this rescue is detailed in Deadliest Sea: The Untold Story Behind the Greatest Rescue in Coast Guard History by Kalee Thompson. As Aviation Week & Space Technology states, \\"The USCG deems the operation the largest cold-water rescue in its history.\\"Aviation Week & Space Technology 12 January 2009, \\"Laureates 2009\\", p. 57 Douglas Munro also made an appearance in an episode of the Discovery Channel series Deadliest Catch, conducting search and rescue operations following the loss of the fishing vessel Ocean Challenger. Douglas Munro continues to serve in the surrounding area. It was also featured in the BBC series Full Circle with Michael Palin in 1997, as the presenter was on the ship at the end of his documentary circumnavigation of the Pacific Rim.

Six lanes of traffic are carried across the bridge, which is in length and at its tallest point. It is the tallest and largest single structure along the entire QEW; the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, which is also part of the QEW, is actually two separate and smaller four-lane bridges. Among all the bridges spanning the present Welland Canal, the Skyway is numbered Bridge 4A (the Homer Lift Bridge is Bridge 4). Construction began in January 1960, with the main span crossing the Welland Canal hoisted into place in July of that same year. The bridge was open to traffic on October 18, 1963. During construction, the bridge was referred to as the Homer Skyway, taking its name from the lift bridge that the new skyway was to replace. Upon dedication, the bridge was officially named the Garden City Skyway, using the nickname of St. Catharines, \\"Canada's Garden City.\\" Tolls were charged on the bridge until 1973. Should the Garden City Skyway be closed due to a traffic accident or weather conditions, traffic is diverted along frontage roads (Dieppe Road, Dunkirk Road, Glendale Avenue, Queenston Road, Taylor Road and York Road) to cross the canal at the Homer Lift Bridge, re-connecting to the QEW on the opposite side. The construction work included an Ontario \\"tall-wall\\" concrete median barrier, new bridge parapets, and the installation of shaded high- pressure sodium lights using the existing truss poles. In 2015, the high- pressure sodium lights on the bridge were replaced with bright white LED lights on the existing truss poles. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) is actively pursuing studies with the goal of twinning the Skyway.

It consisted of one main line, with no branch lines and remained privately owned until its closure. History From the time that the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway (L&ER;) was completed in 1859 there was a number of proposals to connect the line with Sligo. A \\"Londonderry, Enniskillen and Sligo Railway\\" was proposed that would have run west from via Manorhamilton direct to Sligo. The Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway (E&BR;) was incorporated in 1862, was opened from on the L&ER; to Bundoran on the Atlantic coast in 1868 and had Parliamentary powers to continue from Bundoran to Sligo, but failed to do so. Poster advertising special trains on the SL&NCR; for the 1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. The SL&NCR; Company was incorporated in 1875, and its construction started at a junction with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Enniskillen and proceeded westwards. The E&BR; accepted defeat and in 1878 Parliament passed an Act allowing it to abandon its commitment to extend to Sligo from Bundoran. The SL&NCR; adopted as its company seal a picture of two steam locomotives colliding, with one derailed and the other remaining on the track. This commemorated the SL&NCR;'s success in reaching Sligo and the E&BR;'s failure to do the same. The SL&NCR; opened as far as in 1879, in 1880, Collooney in 1881 and Carrignagat Junction on the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) opened in 1882, completing a line of about . Beyond Carrignagat Junction the SL&NCR; exercised running powers over the MGWR to and from Sligo. In 1895 the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway (WL&WR;) was extended to Collooney, forming junctions with the MGWR and SL&NCR.; This gave access to a larger area of western Ireland, whose cattle exports formed a significant part of the SL&NCR;'s traffic. In 1878 a stationmaster‚Äôs house and six houses were built for SL&NCR; workers and their families at Belcoo, County Fermanagh. Belcoo station opened in 1879, serving both Belcoo and Blacklion, County Cavan. The last trains through the station ran on 20 September 1957. The SL&NCR; was one of the railways that the Irish Free State's Great Southern Railways did not absorb in 1925 because it crossed the border with Northern Ireland. It became the last privately owned railway undertaking to survive in Ireland (although the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway still existed as a road transport firm). The company never prospered since the countryside it crossed was poor and sparsely populated, although at one time intermittent heavy cattle traffic used the line. Governments on both sides of the border subsidised the railway in its later years, but the SL&NCR; closed on 1 October 1957 as a result of the Government of Northern Ireland making the GNR Board close its line through Enniskillen. Motive power SL&NCR; locomotives had names, but were not numbered. The company had the use of only two turntables: its own at and the Midland Great Western Railway one at , and so tank engines were the preferred option. =Pioneer and Sligo= Its first two main line locomotives were a pair with an 0-6-2T wheel arrangement, Pioneer and Sligo, built by the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol, England and delivered in 1877. These were unsteady riders on the SL&NCR;'s light track, but the company kept them in service until 1921. =Leitrim class= After the disappointment of the Pioneer class, the SL&NCR; turned to the 0-6-4T wheel arrangement. In 1879 Beyer, Peacock and Company of Gorton Foundry, Manchester, England had supplied the South Australian Railways K class, which was built to the Irish gauge and designed to run on lightweight track. As a result, the SL&NCR; ordered an enlarged version of this design which became the SLNCR Leitrim class. Beyer, Peacock delivered the first two of this class, Fermanagh and Leitrim, in 1882. Proving reliable, the SL&NCR; obtained further examples from Beyer, Peacock in 1895, Hazelwood and 1899, Lissadell The SL&NCR; started withdrawing the class from service in 1947 and one of the class survived until the closure of the line in 1957. =Sir Henry class= In 1904 Beyer, Peacock delivered Sir Henry, an enlarged and modernised 0-6-4T design, the SLNCR Sir Henry class. Enniskillen was delivered in 1905 and \\"Lough Gill\\" in 1917. All three survived until the closure of the line in 1957. =Lough class= Further enlargement and modernisation of the design resulted in the SLNCR Lough class. There were only two locomotives of this type, Lough Melvin and Lough Erne, and they were built by Beyer, Peacock in 1949. When the line was closed in 1957 they were sold to the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA), with whom they remained in service until the 1960s. One of them, Lough Erne, is now preserved by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead, County Antrim. =Railbuses and railcars= The SL&NCR; was an early adopter of railbuses and railcars, which it introduced in the 1930s and 1940s. One of the latter, Railcar B, was built in 1947 and is now preserved by the Downpatrick and County Down Railway at Downpatrick.

The order started in 1822 and is known as the Buffs to members. The RAOB organisation aids members, their families, dependents of former members and other charitable organisations. The Order's motto is \\"No Man Is At All Times Wise\\" (Latin: Nemo Mortalium Omnibus Horis Sapit) and it has the maxim of \\"Justice, Truth and Philanthropy\\". The Order has a Rule Book, Manual of Instruction and Ceremony Lectures issued and revised by the Grand Lodge of England. The 'lodge' description for branch organisation and headquarters was adopted in imitation of Freemasonry. History =Origin in London= The RAOB was begun in the Harp Tavern (opposite the Drury Lane Theatre) by the artist Joseph Lisle and comedian William Sinnett, along with stage hands and theatre technicians, in August 1822. It drew its then name of The Buffaloes from a popular song of the time: We‚Äôll chase the Buffalo. This first meeting is historically the Harponian Lodge. As members toured the country with various shows, lodges were opened in other towns. During the 19th century the Order spread throughout the British Commonwealth and lodges now exist in Britain, Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Middle East, India, Africa, Gibraltar and Cyprus. =New lodges= As the Order spread through the United Kingdom, when a lodge opened in a new area, it became a Mother Lodge, from which subsequent Minor Lodges would be opened. The Mother Lodge would support and advise new lodges on rules and administration of membership. These Mother Lodges developed into the body responsible for administration and organisation, and as the Order grew District Grand Lodges and later Provincial Grand Lodges were opened. =Grand Lodge= In April 1866 a Grand Lodge (later known as the Grand Lodge of England) was formed to control the Order, to set laws, to establish procedures and manage administration. Divisions within the Order led to break-ups and the Grand Lodge of England fractured into smaller 'Banners' between which there was often rivalry. One Banner became the Grand Lodge of England Ltd, wrongly believing that by forming as a company they could gain exclusive usage of the name. The 'Grand Surrey Banner' proclaimed itself Mother Lodge of the World. Dozens of Banners were created around London, and many more elsewhere. =Name changes= The Order's honorifics of \\"royal\\" when it did not have royal patronage nor a royal charter, and \\"antediluvian\\" when its foundations are of historical record, or that it is a chivalric order although it had no standing nor recognition from any house of nobility, are meant to add mock solemnity to its fellowship status and have no more veracity than its having anything to do with the buffalo. The Seditious Meetings Acts of the 19th century affected the gatherings of clubs throughout Britain. To overcome this and show the Buffaloes were not subversive to the interest of the state, the Order described itself as the \\"Loyal Order of Buffaloes\\"'. The word \\"loyal\\" was often mispronounced as royal, and soon stuck. The addition of \\"antediluvian\\" (meaning before the time of the flood in the Bible, and referring to the Order's principles) occurred in the 1850s. The Royal Warrant Act required any organisation using the 'royal' prefix to register with the Lord Chamberlain's Office and to desist from using the title if permission was not granted. Since the Buffaloes had been using the title from the 1840s, the Lord Chamberlain agreed that no objection would be raised to continued use of the title on the grounds of long usage, provided no act by the Order arose that would disgrace its use. =Twentieth century= First World War RAOB GLE Ambulance c. 1916 The First World War led to temporary or even permanent closure of many Lodges due to the enlistment of members. The Buffs supported the war effort through supplying ambulances to bring wounded soldiers back from the front lines. Initially six motorised ambulances were purchased, and sent with each one manned by 'Volunteer Buffs'. More followed and, on their return after the war, the ambulances formed the first ambulance service in England. In 1926, Lord Alverstone succeeded in persuading the Order to purchase Grove House, Harrogate, for use as an orphanage to which every active member contributed a ha'penny (half of one old penny). When the orphanage was no longer a requirement after the state took over responsibility for orphans, the Order began a new charity fund which is still in place today. Ingham, Queensland, 1935 During the Second World War, the Order offered Grove House for use as a military hospital. In 1949, an international convention in Glasgow reported over 1000 attendees from around 4000 lodges, and was to celebrate 130 years of the Order. Sir Andrew Murray, the Lord Provost, addressed the conference. =Present day= Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes Civil and Military Lodge, Whittington, Staffordshire, c. 1920 The RAOB continues its work in the local community, helping those its members promise to assist in times of difficulty or need. Minor Lodges throughout the United Kingdom and the rest of the world raise money for charities and charitable causes. As with many organisations dating from the pre-Victorian period, there has been a noticeable decline in membership since a boom in the 1970s. By 2012 Scotland's oldest lodge, the Royal Edinburgh Lodge No. 854, was down to 25 members.Edinburgh Evening News 16 January 2012 Membership Membership is open to all males over the age of 18 who are willing to declare that they are \\"true and loyal supporters of the British Crown and Constitution\\". Discussion of politics or religion is strictly forbidden at gatherings, as is gambling. Structure The Order has three tiers: Minor (Private) Lodges, Provincial Grand Lodges (under a local governing body) and the Grand Lodge. Each Province may also have a Knights Chapter and Roll of Honour (ROH) Assembly, the minimum entry requirement being that the member has attained the appropriate degree to be admitted. Charitable funds exist at Lodge, Province and Grand Lodge levels to assist members of the Order and/or their dependents requiring assistance. The Grand Lodge used to own and operate two convalescent homes to provide rest and recuperation facilities for members, but due to financial difficulties these were sold. =Office and Degree= There are four degrees within the RAOB: :#Brother (1st degree) (Kangaroo) :#Certified Primo (2nd degree) :#Knight of the Order of Merit (Knight Sir) (3rd degree) :#Roll Of Honour (Right Honourable Sir) (4th degree) In a Minor Lodge, there are 12 officers: :#Worthy Primo :#City Marshall :#City Secretary :#City Treasurer :#City Chamberlain :#City Tyler :#City Constable :#City Registrar :#City Minstrel :#City Waiter :#Alderman of Benevolence :#Lodge Trustees x 3 References External links * Fraternal orders Fraternities 1822 establishments in the United Kingdom Organizations established in 1822 Friendly societies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes"},{"id":"1789178","title":"George Scratchley Brown"},{"id":"1789180","text":"Paul A.

Political career Before his service as State Senator, Sarlo spent one term in the General Assembly, the lower house of the New Jersey Legislature, from 2002 to 2003. He and Wallington, New Jersey mayor Walter Wargacki sought to unseat Republican incumbent Paul DiGaetano and take the second seat that was vacated when John Kelly decided to challenge for the State Senate (which he lost). Although the Democrats did not gain both seats Sarlo was able to finish second in the voting and won a seat. After he was appointed to the State Senate he was replaced by Frederick Scalera. As an Assemblyman, he served as Vice Chairman of the Labor Committee and as a member of the Appropriations Committee. Additionally, he was a member of the Assembly Light Rail Panel and the Assembly Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility. While in the Assembly, Sarlo was the prime sponsor of the bill creating a $29 million grant to establish a statewide bio-terrorism response plan. He also sponsored legislation to restore the Office of Public Advocate and to provide benefits and incentives for members of volunteer fire departments and rescue squads. He has also taken leading roles on legislation related to the health and welfare of women and children.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to- beat interval. Other terms used include: \\"cycle length variability\\", \\"RR variability\\" (where R is a point corresponding to the peak of the QRS complex of the ECG wave; and RR is the interval between successive Rs), and \\"heart period variability\\". Methods used to detect beats include: ECG, blood pressure, ballistocardiograms, and the pulse wave signal derived from a photoplethysmograph (PPG). ECG is considered superior because it provides a clear waveform, which makes it easier to exclude heartbeats not originating in the sinoatrial node. The term \\"NN\\" is used in place of RR to emphasize the fact that the processed beats are \\"normal\\" beats. Clinical significance Reduced HRV has been shown to be a predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction although others have shown that the information in HRV relevant to acute myocardial infarction survival is fully contained in the mean heart rate. A range of other outcomes and conditions may also be associated with modified (usually lower) HRV, including congestive heart failure, diabetic neuropathy, post‚Äìcardiac-transplant depression, susceptibility to SIDS and poor survival in premature babies. Psychological and social aspects A simplified representation of the neurovisceral integration model There is interest in HRV in the field of psychophysiology. For example, HRV is related to emotional arousal. High-frequency (HF) activity has been found to decrease under conditions of acute time pressure and emotional strain and elevated anxiety state, presumably related to focused attention and motor inhibition. HRV has been shown to be reduced in individuals reporting to worry more. In individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), HRV and its HF component (see below) is reduced whilst the low-frequency (LF) component is elevated. Furthermore, PTSD patients demonstrated no LF or HF reactivity to recalling a traumatic event. The neurovisceral integration is a model of HRV that views the central autonomic network as the decision maker of cognitive, behavioral and physiological regulation as they pertain to a continuum of emotion. The neurovisceral integration model describes how the prefrontal cortex regulates activity in limbic structures which act to suppress parasympathetic activity and activate sympathetic circuits. Variation in the output of these two branches of the autonomic system produces HRV and activity in the prefrontal cortex can hence modulate HRV. HRV is the measure of the inconsistent gaps between each heartbeat and is used as an index for different aspects of psychology. HRV is reported to be an index of the influence of both the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous systems. Different aspects of psychology represent the balance of these two influences. For example, high HRV is shown proper emotion regulation, decision-making, and attention, and low HRV reflects the opposite. The parasympathetic nervous system works quickly to decrease heart rate, while the SNS works slowly to increase heart rate, and this is important because it applies to the different psychological states mentioned above. For example, someone with high HRV may reflect increased parasympathetic activity, and someone with low HRV may reflect increased sympathetic activity. Emotions stem from the time and impact of a situation on a person. The ability to regulate emotions is essential for social environments and well-being. HRV has provided a window to the physiological components associated with emotional regulation. HRV has been shown to reflect emotional regulation at two different levels, while resting and while completing a task. Research suggests that a person with higher HRV while resting can provide more appropriate emotional responses compared to those that have low HRV at rest. Empirical research found that HRV can reflect better emotional regulation by those with higher resting HRV, particularly with negative emotions. When completing a task, HRV is subject to change, especially when people need to regulate their emotions. Most importantly, individual differences are related to the ability to regulate emotions. Not only is emotional regulation necessary, but so is attention. Previous research has suggested that a large part of the attention regulation is due to the default inhibitory properties of the prefrontal cortex. Top-down processes from the prefrontal cortex provide parasympathetic influences, and if for some reason, those influences are active, attention can suffer. For example, researchers have suggested that HRV can index attention. For example, a group of researchers found that groups with high anxiety and low HRV have poor attention. In line with this research, it has also been suggested that increased attention has been linked to high HRV and increased vagus nerve activity. The vagus nerve activity reflects the physiological modulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. The activity behind the prefrontal cortex and the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system can influence heart activity. However, people are not all affected the same. A systematic review of HRV and cognitive function suggested that resting HRV can predict individual differences in attentional performance. Even in psychological concepts such as attention, HRV can index individual differences. Furthermore, HRV has been able to index the role of attention and performance, supporting high HRV as a biomarker of increased attention and performance. Both emotion and attention can shed light on how HRV is used as an index for decision making. Decision-making skills are found to be indexed by HRV in several studies. Previous research has suggested that both emotion and attention are linked to decision making; for example, poor decision making is linked to the inability to regulate or control emotions and attention and vice versa. Decision making is negatively affected by lower HRV and positively affected by higher levels of HRV. Most importantly, resting-state HRV was found to be a significant predictor of cognitive functions such as decision making. HRV, accompanied by a psychological state, such as anxiety, has been found to lead to poor decisions. For example, a group of researchers found that low HRV was an index of higher uncertainty leading to poor decision- making skills, especially those with higher levels of anxiety. HRV was also used to assess decision-making skills in a high-risk game and was found to be an index higher sympathetic activation (lower HRV) when making decisions involving risk. HRV can index psychological concepts, such as the ones outlined above, to assess the demand for the situations that people experience. The polyvagal theory is another way to describe the pathways in the autonomic nervous system that mediate HRV. The polyvagal theory highlights three main ordinal processes, inactive response to an environmental threat, the active response to an environmental threat, and the fluctuation between the connect and disconnect to an environmental threat. This theory decomposes heart rate variability based on frequency domain characteristics with an emphasis on respiratory sinus arrhythmia and its transmission by a neural pathway that is distinct from other components of HRV. There is anatomic and physiological evidence for a polyvagal control of the heart. Variation Variation in the beat-to-beat interval is a physiological phenomenon. The SA node receives several different inputs and the instantaneous heart rate or RR interval and its variation are the results of these inputs. The main inputs are the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and humoral factors. Respiration gives rise to waves in heart rate mediated primarily via the PSNS, and it is thought that the lag in the baroreceptor feedback loop may give rise to 10 second waves in heart rate (associated with Mayer waves of blood pressure), but this remains controversial. Factors that affect the input are the baroreflex, thermoregulation, hormones, sleep-wake cycle, meals, physical activity, and stress. Decreased PSNS activity or increased SNS activity will result in reduced HRV. High frequency (HF) activity (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), especially, has been linked to PSNS activity. Activity in this range is associated with the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a vagally mediated modulation of heart rate such that it increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration. Less is known about the physiological inputs of the low frequency (LF) activity (0.04 to 0.15 Hz). Though previously thought to reflect SNS activity, it is now widely accepted that it reflects a mixture of both the SNS and PSNS. Phenomena There are two primary fluctuations: * Respiratory arrhythmia (or respiratory sinus arrhythmia). von Haller A. Elementa Physiologica. Lausanne, Switzerland: 1760; T II, Lit VI, 330 This heart rate variation is associated with respiration and faithfully tracks the respiratory rate across a range of frequencies. * Low-frequency oscillations. This heart rate variation is associated with Mayer waves (Traube‚ÄìHering‚ÄìMayer waves) of blood pressure and is usually at a frequency of 0.1 Hz, or a 10-second period. Artifact Errors in the location of the instantaneous heart beat will result in errors in the calculation of the HRV. HRV is highly sensitive to artifact and errors in as low as even 2% of the data will result in unwanted biases in HRV calculations. To ensure accurate results therefore it is critical to manage artifact and RR errors appropriately prior to performing any HRV analyses. Robust management of artifacts, including RWave identification, interpolation and exclusion requires a high degree of care and precision. This can be very time consuming in large studies with data recorded over long durations. Software packages are able to assist users with a variety of robust and tested artifact management tools. These software programs also include some automated capability but it is important that a human review any automated artifact management and edit accordingly. Analysis The most widely used methods can be grouped under time-domain and frequency-domain. A joint European and American task-force described standards in HRV measurements in 1996. Other methods have been proposed, such as non-linear methods. =Time-domain methods= These are based on the beat-to-beat or NN intervals, which are analysed to give variables such as: * SDNN, the standard deviation of NN intervals. Often calculated over a 24-hour period. SDANN, the standard deviation of the average NN intervals calculated over short periods, usually 5 minutes. SDNN is therefore a measure of changes in heart rate due to cycles longer than 5 minutes. SDNN reflects all the cyclic components responsible for variability in the period of recording, therefore it represents total variability. *RMSSD (\\"root mean square of successive differences\\"), the square root of the mean of the squares of the successive differences between adjacent NNs. *SDSD (\\"standard deviation of successive differences\\"), the standard deviation of the successive differences between adjacent NNs. *NN50, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms. *pNN50, the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs. *NN20, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 20 ms. *pNN20, the proportion of NN20 divided by total number of NNs. *EBC (\\"estimated breath cycle\\"), the range (max-min) within a moving window of a given time duration within the study period. The windows can move in a self-overlapping way or be strictly distinct (sequential) windows. EBC is often provided in data acquisition scenarios where HRV feedback in real time is a primary goal. EBC derived from PPG over 10-second and 16-second sequential and overlapping windows has been shown to correlate highly with SDNN. =Geometric methods= The series of NN intervals also can be converted into a geometric pattern such as: Geometric Measures HRV triangular index: integral of density distribution / maximum of density distribution maximum HRV triangular index = Number of all NN intervals / maximum number. Dependent on the length of the bin -> quote the bin size+ relative insensitive to the analytic quality of the series of NN intervals - need of reasonable number of NN intervals to generate the geometric pattern (in practice 20 min to 24 h)-not appropriate to assess short-term changes in HRV * the sample density distribution of NN interval durations; * sample density distribution of differences between adjacent NN intervals; * a scatterplot of each NN (or RR) interval with the immediately preceding NN (or RR) interval Parameter aus dem Lorenz-Plot (Parameters from the Lorenz-Plot brain & heart, \\"Parameter der Herzratenvariabilit√§t\\" (Parameters of HRV), by Dr. Egon Winter, Austria. Accessed 2016-11-20. In German. ‚Äî also called \\"Poincare plot\\" or (apparently in error 'LORENZ CURVE' command in online user manual for 'Dataplot' software, published by NIST, U.S.A.

A simple formula is then used that judges the variability on the basis of the geometric and/or graphics properties of the resulting pattern. =Frequency- domain methods= Frequency domain methods assign bands of frequency and then count the number of NN intervals that match each band. The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, and the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz. Several methods of analysis are available. Power spectral density (PSD), using parametric or nonparametric methods, provides basic information on the power distribution across frequencies. One of the most commonly used PSD methods is the discrete Fourier transform. Methods for the calculation of PSD may be generally classified as nonparametric and parametric. In most instances, both methods provide comparable results. The advantages of the nonparametric methods are (1) the simplicity of the algorithm used (fast Fourier transform [FFT] in most of the cases) and (2) the high processing speed. The advantages of parametric methods are (1) smoother spectral components that can be distinguished independent of preselected frequency bands, (2) easy postprocessing of the spectrum with an automatic calculation of low- and high-frequency power components with an easy identification of the central frequency of each component, and (3) an accurate estimation of PSD even on a small number of samples on which the signal is supposed to maintain stationarity. The basic disadvantage of parametric methods is the need of verification of the suitability of the chosen model and of its complexity (that is, the order of the model). In addition to classical FFT-based methods used for the calculation of frequency parameters, a more appropriate PSD estimation method is the Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram. Analysis has shown that the LS periodogram can produce a more accurate estimate of the PSD than FFT methods for typical RR data. Since the RR data is an unevenly sampled data, another advantage of the LS method is that in contrast to FFT-based methods it is able to be used without the need to resample and detrend the RR data. Alternatively, to avoid artefacts that are created when calculating the power of a signal that includes a single high-intensity peak (for example caused by an arrhythmic heart beat), the concept of the 'instantaneous Amplitude' has been introduced, which is based on the Hilbert transform of the RR data. A newly used HRV index, which depends on the wavelet entropy measures, is an alternative choice. The wavelet entropy measures are calculated using a three-step procedure defined in the literature. First, the wavelet packet algorithm is implemented using the Daubechies 4 (DB4) function as the mother wavelet with a scale of 7. Once the wavelet coefficients are obtained, the energy for each coefficient are calculated as described in the literature. After calculating the normalized values of wavelet energies, which represent the relative wavelet energy (or the probability distribution), the wavelet entropies are obtained using the definition of entropy given by Shannon. =Non-linear methods= Given the complexity of the mechanisms regulating heart rate, it is reasonable to assume that applying HRV analysis based on methods of non-linear dynamics will yield valuable information. Although chaotic behavior has been assumed, more rigorous testing has shown that heart rate variability cannot be described as a low dimensional chaotic process. However, application of chaotic globals to HRV has been shown to predict diabetes status. The most commonly used non-linear method of analysing heart rate variability is the Poincar√© plot. Each data point represents a pair of successive beats, the x-axis is the current RR interval, while the y-axis is the previous RR interval. HRV is quantified by fitting mathematically defined geometric shapes to the data. Other methods used are the correlation dimension, symbolic dynamics, nonlinear predictability, pointwise correlation dimension, detrended fluctuation analysis, approximate entropy, sample entropy, multiscale entropy analysis, sample asymmetry and memory length (based on inverse statistical analysis). It is also possible to represent long range correlations geometrically. =Long term correlations= Sequences of RR intervals have been found to have long-term correlations. However, one flaw with these analyses is their lack of goodness-of-fit statistics, i.e. values are derived that may or may not have adequate statistical rigor. Different types of correlations have been found during different sleep stages. =Cross correlation with other systems= The question of how heartbeat rhythms are correlated with other physiologic systems such as lung and brain was studied by Bashan et al . It is found that while during wake, light and REM sleep the correlation between heartbeat with other physiological systems are high, they almost vanish during deep sleep. Duration and circumstances of ECG recording Time domain methods are preferred to frequency domain methods when short-term recordings are investigated. This is due to the fact that the recording should be at least 10 times the wavelength of the lowest frequency bound of interest. Thus, recording of approximately 1 minute is needed to assess the HF components of HRV (i.e., a lowest bound of 0.15 Hz is a cycle of 6.6 seconds and so 10 cycles require ~60 seconds), while more than 4 minutes are needed to address the LF component (with a lower bound of 0.04 Hz). Although time domain methods, especially the SDNN and RMSSD methods, can be used to investigate recordings of long durations, a substantial part of the long-term variability is day‚Äìnight differences. Thus, long-term recordings analyzed by time domain methods should contain at least 18 hours of analyzable ECG data that include the whole night. Physiological correlates of HRV components =Autonomic influences of heart rate= Although cardiac automaticity is intrinsic to various pacemaker tissues, heart rate and rhythm are largely under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The parasympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated via release of acetylcholine by the vagus nerve. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors respond to this release mostly by an increase in cell membrane K+ conductance. Acetylcholine also inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated \\"pacemaker\\" current. The \\"Ik decay\\" hypothesis proposes that pacemaker depolarization results from slow deactivation of the delayed rectifier current, Ik, which, due to a time-independent background inward current, causes diastolic depolarization. Conversely, the \\"If activation\\" hypothesis suggests that after action potential termination, If provides a slowly activating inward current predominating over decaying Ik, thus initiating slow diastolic depolarization. The sympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated by release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors results in cAMP- mediated phosphorylation of membrane proteins and increases in ICaL and in If the end result is an acceleration of the slow diastolic depolarization. Under resting conditions, vagal tone prevails and variations in heart period are largely dependent on vagal modulation. The vagal and sympathetic activity constantly interact. Because the sinus node is rich in acetylcholinesterase, the effect of any vagal impulse is brief because the acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed. Parasympathetic influences exceed sympathetic effects probably through two independent mechanisms: a cholinergically induced reduction of norepinephrine released in response to sympathetic activity, and a cholinergic attenuation of the response to an adrenergic stimulus. =Components= The RR interval variations present during resting conditions represent beat-by-beat variations in cardiac autonomic inputs. However, efferent vagal (parasympathetic) activity is a major contributor to the HF component, as seen in clinical and experimental observations of autonomic maneuvers such as electrical vagal stimulation, muscarinic receptor blockade, and vagotomy. More problematic is the interpretation of the LF component, which was considered by some as a marker of sympathetic modulation (especially when expressed in normalized units) but is now known to include both sympathetic and vagal influences. For example, during sympathetic activation the resulting tachycardia is usually accompanied by a marked reduction in total power, whereas the reverse occurs during vagal activation. Thus the spectral components change in the same direction and do not indicate that LF faithfully reflects sympathetic effects. HRV measures fluctuations in autonomic inputs to the heart rather than the mean level of autonomic inputs. Thus, both withdrawal and saturatingly high levels of autonomic input to the heart can lead to diminished HRV. Changes related to specific pathologies A reduction of HRV has been reported in several cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases. =Myocardial infarction= Depressed HRV after MI may reflect a decrease in vagal activity directed to the heart. HRV in patients surviving an acute MI reveal a reduction in total and in the individual power of spectral components. The presence of an alteration in neural control is also reflected in a blunting of day-night variations of RR interval. In post-MI patients with a very depressed HRV, most of the residual energy is distributed in the VLF frequency range below 0.03 Hz, with only a small respiration-related variations. =Diabetic neuropathy= In neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus characterized by alteration in small nerve fibers, a reduction in time domain parameters of HRV seems not only to carry negative prognostic value but also to precede the clinical expression of autonomic neuropathy. In diabetic patients without evidence of autonomic neuropathy, reduction of the absolute power of LF and HF during controlled conditions was also reported. Similarly, diabetic patients can be differentiated from normal controls on the basis of reduction in HRV. =Cardiac transplantation= A very reduced HRV with no definite spectral components has been reported in patients with a recent heart transplant. The appearance of discrete spectral components in a few patients is considered to reflect cardiac reinnervation. This reinnervation may occur as early as 1 to 2 years after transplantation and is assumed to be of sympathetic origin. In addition, a correlation between respiratory rate and the HF component of HRV observed in some transplanted patients also indicates that a nonneural mechanism may generate a respiration-related rhythmic oscillation. =Myocardial dysfunction= A reduced HRV has been observed consistently in patients with cardiac failure. In this condition characterized by signs of sympathetic activation such as faster heart rates and high levels of circulating catecholamines, a relation between changes in HRV and the extent of left ventricular dysfunction was reported. In fact, whereas the reduction in time domain measures of HRV seemed to parallel the severity of the disease, the relationship between spectral components and indices of ventricular dysfunction appears to be more complex. In particular, in most patients with a very advanced phase of the disease and with a drastic reduction in HRV, an LF component could not be detected despite the clinical signs of sympathetic activation. This reflects that, as stated above, the LF may not accurately reflect cardiac sympathetic tone. =Liver cirrhosis= Liver cirrhosis is associated with decreased HRV. Decreased HRV in patients with cirrhosis has a prognostic value and predicts mortality. Loss of HRV is also associated with higher plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and impaired neurocognitive function in this patient population. =Sepsis= HRV is decreased in patients with sepsis. Loss of HRV has both diagnostic and prognostic value in neonates with sepsis. The pathophysiology of decreased HRV in sepsis is not well understood but there is experimental evidence to show that partial uncoupling of cardiac pacemaker cells from autonomic neural control may play a role in decreased HRV during acute systemic inflammation. =Tetraplegia= Patients with chronic complete high cervical spinal cord lesions have intact efferent vagal neural pathways directed to the sinus node. However, an LF component can be detected in HRV and arterial pressure variabilities of some tetraplegic patients. Thus, the LF component of HRV in those without intact sympathetic inputs to the heart represent vagal modulation. =Sudden cardiac death= Victims of sudden cardiac death have been found to have had lower HRV than healthy individuals. =Cancer= HRV correlates with the progression of disease and outcome of cancer patients, according to a systematic review of published studies. Modifications by specific interventions Interventions that augment HRV may be protective against cardiac mortality and sudden cardiac death. Although the rationale for changing HRV is sound, it also contains the inherent danger of leading to the unwarranted assumption that modification of HRV translates directly into cardiac protection, which may not be the case. Despite the growing consensus that increases in vagal activity can be beneficial, it is not as yet known how much vagal activity (or HRV as a marker) has to increase in order to provide adequate protection. =Œ≤-Adrenergic blockade= The data on the effect of Œ≤-blockers on HRV in post-MI patients are surprisingly scant. Despite the observation of statistically significant increases, the actual changes are very modest. In conscious post-MI dogs, Œ≤-blockers do not modify HRV. The unexpected observation that before MI, Œ≤-blockade increases HRV only in the animals destined to be at low risk for lethal arrhythmias after MI may suggest novel approaches to post-MI risk stratification. =Antiarrhythmic drugs= Data exist for several antiarrhythmic drugs. Flecainide and propafenone but not amiodarone were reported to decrease time domain measures of HRV in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmia. In another study, propafenone reduced HRV and decreased LF much more than HF. A larger study confirmed that flecainide, also encainide and moricizine, decreased HRV in post-MI patients but found no correlation between the change in HRV and mortality during follow-up. Thus, some antiarrhythmic drugs associated with increased mortality can reduce HRV. However, it is not known whether these changes in HRV have any direct prognostic significance. =Scopolamine= Low-dose muscarinic receptor blockers, such as atropine and scopolamine, may produce a paradoxical increase in vagal effects on the heart, as suggested by a decrease in heart rate. In addition, scopolamine and low dose atropine can markedly increase HRV. However, though the heart rate slowing in proportional to the (low) dose of atropine, the increase in HRV varies widely across and within individuals. This suggests that even for vagal activity to the heart, HRV may be a limited marker. =Thrombolysis= The effect of thrombolysis on HRV (assessed by pNN50) was reported in 95 patients with acute MI. HRV was higher 90 minutes after thrombolysis in the patients with patency of the infarct-related artery. However, this difference was no longer evident when the entire 24 hours were analyzed. =Exercise training= Exercise training may decrease cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death. Regular exercise training is also thought to modify cardiac autonomic control. Individuals who exercise regularly have a 'training bradycardia' (i.e., low resting heart rate) and generally have higher HRV than sedentary individuals. =Biofeedback= The technique called resonant breathing biofeedback teaches how to recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased. A first overall meta-analysis by Goessl VC et al. (24 studies, 484 individuals, 2017) indicates HRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety, while mentioning that more well-controlled studies are needed. =Wind instruments= One study that surveyed the physiological effects of playing Native American flutes found a significant HRV increase when playing both low-pitched and high-pitched flutes. Normal values of standard measures Even though there are no widely accepted standard values for HRV that can be used for clinical purposes, The Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and Heart Rhythm Society (formerly called North American Society of Pacing Electrophysiology) provided initial normative values of standard measures of HRV  See also  * Heart rate turbulence * Sinus rhythm  References   External links  * Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback * Biofeedback Federation of Europe * 1996 guidelines * Review on the mechanisms of cardiovascular variability in the Journal of Physiology *Courses and educational materials * Heart Rate Variability and Ayurveda Medical statistics Cardiology Statistical signal processing Medical signs ","title":"Heart rate variability"},{"id":"1789199","text":"\\"Megalomaniac\\" is a song by industrial rock band KMFDM from the album commonly referred to as Symbols.

Electromagnetic wattmeters are used for measurement of utility frequency and audio frequency power; other types are required for radio frequency measurements. A wattmeter reads the average value of the product v(t)i(t) = p(t), where v(t) is the voltage with reference polarity in the ¬± terminal with respect to the other terminal of the potential (pressure) coil, and i(t) is the current with reference direction flowing into the ¬± terminal of the current coil. The wattmeter reads P = (1/T) ‚à´0T v(t)i(t) dt, which in sinusoidal steady-state reduces to Vrms Irms cos(œÜ), where T is the period of p(t) and œÜ is the angle by which the current lags the voltage.

HauptmannBarry and M. Pressman patent Electronic wattmeter. This device is made up from power, current and voltage transformers, who measure the average power.US3959724A - Electronic wattmeter Electrodynamic Early wattmeter on display at the Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in Pachuca, Mexico The traditional analog wattmeter is an electrodynamic instrument. The device consists of a pair of fixed coils, known as current coils, and a movable coil known as the potential coil. The current coils are connected in series with the circuit, while the potential coil is connected in parallel. Also, on analog wattmeters, the potential coil carries a needle that moves over a scale to indicate the measurement. A current flowing through the current coil generates an electromagnetic field around the coil. The strength of this field is proportional to the line current and in phase with it. The potential coil has, as a general rule, a high-value resistor connected in series with it to reduce the current that flows through it. The result of this arrangement is that on a DC circuit, the deflection of the needle is proportional to both the current (I) and the voltage (V), thus conforming to the equation P=VI. For AC power, current and voltage may not be in phase, owing to the delaying effects of circuit inductance or capacitance. On an AC circuit the deflection is proportional to the average instantaneous product of voltage and current, thus measuring active power, P=VI cos œÜ. Here, cos œÜ represents the power factor which shows that the power transmitted may be less than the apparent power obtained by multiplying the readings of a voltmeter and ammeter in the same circuit. The two circuits of a wattmeter can be damaged by excessive current. The ammeter and voltmeter are both vulnerable to overheating‚Äîin case of an overload, their pointers will be driven off scale‚Äîbut in the wattmeter, either or even both the current and potential circuits can overheat without the pointer approaching the end of the scale. This is because the position of the pointer depends on the power factor, voltage and current. Thus, a circuit with a low power factor will give a low reading on the wattmeter, even when both of its circuits are loaded to the maximum safety limit. Therefore, a wattmeter is rated not only in watts, but also in volts and amperes. A typical wattmeter in educational labs has two voltage coils (pressure coils) and a current coil. The two pressure coils can be connected in series or parallel to change the ranges of the wattmeter. The pressure coil can also be tapped to change the meter's range. If the pressure coil has range of 300 volts, the half of it can be used so that the range becomes 150 volts.

For each sample, the voltage is multiplied by the current at the same instant; the average over at least one cycle is the real power. The real power divided by the apparent volt-amperes (VA) is the power factor. A computer circuit uses the sampled values to calculate RMS voltage, RMS current, VA, power (watts), power factor, and kilowatt-hours. The readings may be displayed on the device, retained to provide a log and calculate averages, or transmitted to other equipment for further use. Wattmeters vary considerably in correctly calculating energy consumption, especially when real power is much lower than VA (highly reactive loads, e.g. electric motors). Simple meters may be calibrated to meet specified accuracy only for sinusoidal waveforms. Waveforms for switched-mode power supplies as used for much electronic equipment may be very far from sinusoidal, leading to unknown and possibly large errors at any power. This may not be specified in the meter's manual. Precision and accuracy There are limitations to measuring power with inexpensive wattmeters, or indeed with any meters not designed for low-power measurements. This particularly affects low power (e.g. under 10 watts), as used in standby; readings may be so inaccurate as to be useless (although they do confirm that standby power is low, rather than high).US Lawrence Livermore laboratory, Standby Power, measuring standby The difficulty is largely due to difficulty in accurate measurement of the alternating current, rather than voltage, and the relatively little need for low-power measurements. The specification for the meter should specify the reading error for different situations. For a typical plug-in meter the error in wattage is stated as ¬±5% of measured value ¬±10 W (e.g., a measured value of 100W may be wrong by 5% of 100 W plus 10 W, i.e., ¬±15 W, or 85‚Äì115 W); and the error in kW¬∑h is stated as ¬±5% of measured value ¬±0.1 kW¬∑h.Data listed in text from manual for inexpensive plug-in electricity meter Brennenstuhl PM230. The lowest measurable current is given as 0.02 A, which corresponds to about 5 W at 230 VAC If a laptop computer in sleep mode consumes 5 W, the meter may read anything from 0 to 15.25 W, without taking into account errors due to non-sinusoidal waveform. In practice accuracy can be improved by connecting a fixed load such as an incandescent light bulb, adding the device in standby, and using the difference in power consumption. This moves the measurement out of the problematic low-power zone. Radio frequency Instruments with moving coils can be calibrated for direct current or power frequency currents up to a few hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a transmission line; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts only a portion of the RF power through the detector. Thermistors and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power.Joseph J. Carr, RF Components and Circuits, Newnes, 2002 pages 351-370 A bolometer power sensor converts incident radio frequency power to heat. The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current. The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power. Watthour meters Itron OpenWay wattmeter with two-way communications for remote reading, in use by DTE Energy An instrument which measures electrical energy in watt hours is essentially a wattmeter which accumulates or averages readings. Digital electronic instruments measure many parameters and can be used where a wattmeter is needed: volts, current,in amperes, apparent instantaneous power, actual power, power factor, energy in [k]W¬∑h over a period of time, and cost of electricity consumed.

Mueller and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) pushed for and achieved a major reorganization, focused on creation of the new Office of Intelligence at the FBI.Neil A. Lewis F.B.I.

Another 59 agents would be reassigned to counterterrorism from white-collar crime investigations and an additional 59 from the violent crimes unit.\\" This reorganization was supported with a significant expansion of FBI personnel with counterterrorism and language skills. In February 2003, Rowley wrote a second open letter to Mueller, in which she warned her superiors that the bureau would not \\"be able to stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq\\". In April 2003, Rowley stepped down from her legal position to return to being a FBI Special Agent. At the end of 2004 she retired from the FBI after serving for 24 years.

At the time of her announcement, she had been living in Apple Valley, Minnesota for 15 years. Rowley had formerly voted and identified as a Republican, but on June 27, 2005, she announced that she was entering the race as a DFLer, and on July 6 officially kicked off her campaign at her home.Mark Zdechlik Kline, Rowley provide clear choice on Iraq Minnesota Public Radio, 26 July 2006 On August 18, 2005, Rowley attended a vigil in Crawford, Texas, outside President George W. Bush's ranch requesting that the president meet with Cindy Sheehan to answer Sheehan's questions about the War in Iraq and the death of Sheehan's son, Casey. On January 3, 2006, an unauthorized professionally retouched image appeared on Rowley's campaign website. This image depicted Kline, a retired Marine Corps colonel, as Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes. Kline objected to the photo, and the Rowley campaign removed the image the same day and initiated an investigation. Rowley apologized quickly. Representative John Murtha (D-PA) endorsed Rowley. He visited the district during the campaign and held a rally for Rowley at the local VFW in Rosemount, while veterans protested outside. The Rowley campaign subsequently focused efforts on veterans' groups and others with direct experience of the war in Iraq. Financing her campaign proved difficult. Opposing an incumbent conservative such as Kline in a conservative district did not attract money from the most robust Democratic resources, such as the DNC. Kline's campaign achieved a 2‚Äì1 advantage in raising funds, and he easily retained his seat. =Civil liberties and peace activism= Since 2003 Rowley has spoken publicly on ethics and ethical decision-making to various groups.University of Iowa News Service Rowley To Discuss Patriot Act, Ethics At UI Lectures University of Iowa, 9 February 2004 She is a writer and blogger.

He retired after 15 years on the force after a shooting incident that left him traumatized. During his recovery from the shooting incident, Walls met Ken Williams, who was then a developer for Sierra On-Line. Williams asked Walls to his house for a game of racquetball, and over drinks after the game, Ken told Walls of his idea of starting an adventure game series with a police genre. Williams told Walls that all he needed was a real police officer to be involved with the design in order to maintain realism. Following that meeting, Walls went on to become a game designer for Sierra On- Line (now Sierra Entertainment). Walls stated \\"When I first sat down in front of a computer to begin the design story of the original Police Quest I had to be shown where the on/off switch was. I typed the entire story with two fingers (after all, the only skills I had at the time were chasing people down and throwing them in jail).\\" Walls' best-known works were the first three Police Quest games (1987's Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel, 1988's Police Quest II: The Vengeance, and 1990's Police Quest III: The Kindred). Walls also created an espionage game called Codename: Iceman in 1989, but this sold poorly in comparison to the Police Quest titles. The games included real situations that he had lived through in his career. The later games in the Police Quest series (Police Quest IV: Open Season, Police Quest: SWAT and Police Quest: SWAT 2) were designed by Darryl F. Gates after Walls left Sierra. Walls also created Blue Force, another adventure game featuring a police officer, in 1993 for Tsunami Games. He is also credited on Earth & Beyond and Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat , in 2002, for Electronic Arts, and had a cameo in the adventure game Blade Runner in 1997, for Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc. Walls is sometimes credited as James Walls. Early life Walls was born raised and schooled in California. Prior to joining the California Highway Patrol, he began a career as an optician in Fresno. For several years he worked for various optometrists and ophthalmologists. Around 1969, Walls met the husband of a co-worker who, at the time was one week shy of graduating the CHP Academy. While speaking with him, Walls was overcome with the man's enthusiasm for his new career and sought a career for himself in police enforcement. In December 1971, he graduated the academy and began his career as a CHP Officer in the Southern California town of Van Nuys. Police career and 1984 shooting incident Walls served as CHP Officer in various assignments throughout the state for the next thirteen years. In January 1984, while making an enforcement stop, he became involved in a shootout with a parolee. Approximately a year later, he began to experience complications related to the shootout. The department placed Walls on administrative leave in order to evaluate his condition and determine the cause. Career change and Sierra years While still on administrative leave in 1985, Walls' then wife Donna, who worked as a hair stylist for a salon in Oakhurst, introduced him to Ken Williams, then president of Sierra. Ken Williams would occasionally visit the hair salon to have his hair cut by Donna. It was during one of these sessions that the focus of conversation turned from hair style to Ken Williams‚Äô idea of creating a police oriented adventure game. He also conveyed that he wanted a genuine policeman to be involved with the design in order to capture the realism. He gave Donna his business card and asked Jim Walls to call him. Walls officially quit the police force in 1986.http://techzwn.com/2013/08/walking-the-beat- with-jim-walls/ The Police Quest journey began in 1987 when Williams invited Walls to his house to play a few rounds of racquetball. Although Walls was an avid handball player, it would be his first experience at racquetball. Walls would soon learn the difference between the two games as Williams handed him a thorough beating. Afterwards, they moved to the game room for beverages and to discuss Williams' idea of a police adventure game. Williams asked if Walls could take some of his experiences as a CHP Officer and put them into a short story about two pages long. He did so, and after a couple days they met again. Williams read the story, commented on it and asked Walls to go home and detail it into 4 or 5 pages, which he subsequently did. This process went on until the first full blown story of Police Quest was complete. From that point the story was converted into a design document and broken into game components. Walls was initially skeptical and a bit nervous, wondering if it was viable to make a living designing computer games. In time he overcame his hesitation, with Ken Williams' wife Roberta Williams giving Walls pointers from time to time as well. Al Lowe came onto the project near the end. Walls would eventually serve as a designer and programmer at Sierra and while most notable for the Police Quest (PQ) series, he also developed Codename: ICEMAN in 1989. Walls recalls the design theme from PQ through PQ3 as being constant. However, after PQ3, circumstances developed causing him to resign from Sierra. Post Sierra years In 1992, Walls joined newly formed Tsunami Media, which largely consisted of former Sierra employees and was housed in Sierra's original locality. Walls' time with Tsunami Media would be brief however, resulting in only one game, Blue Force, which was coincidentally also a police adventure. After Tsunami Media, Walls contracted with two other companies on titles which were never published. The first was Tachyon Studios, yet another splinter group from Sierra. The second was Phillips Interactive Media. In 1996, Walls settled in with Westwood Studios in Las Vegas, where he worked on Blade Runner. He was subsequently offered a full-time design position, which involved work with other titles such as Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat and Earth & Beyond. Westwood Studios was eventually bought out by Electronic Arts and later phased out. Walls's employment with Westwood Studios ended in 2003. Future plans On February 2, 2013 Jim did a live audio podcast with Co- Founder of Guys From Andromeda LLC, Chris Pope. Jim announced live that he has plans to create a new adventure game similar to Police Quest. This will be a new IP for Jim. The announcement also included plans to use Kickstarter as the funding method for the new game. On July 16, 2013, the new game proposal was finally announced. Precinct is a spiritual successor to the classic Sierra franchise Police Quest. Sierra veteran Robert Lindsley has been signed on as the game's executive producer. The game will be developed by newly established studio Jim Walls Reloaded, where Lindsley also serves as the company's president. The game aspires to follow the classic Sierra adventure game formula with a \\"modern feel\\". It has a funding goal of $500,000, with a fundraising period stretching from Jul 16, 2013 - Aug 16, 2013. However, this project was not successful and Walls cancelled the Kickstarter fundraising on August 6, 2013. Subsequently, Walls and Lindsley announced that they would instead launch an alternative fundraising campaign for Precinct, which they called \\"new and unique\\". The new crowdfunding campaign would not have the same time restrictions as Kickstarter has and the game will be launched once the funding from its backers is secured. However, this campaign was also unsuccessful and was shut down two weeks later as Lindsley explained: \\"We simply don't have the momentum needed to meet the requirements of this project\\". Nevertheless, Walls and Lindsley still remain hopeful to realise Precinct sometime in the future.http://fund.precinctgame.com As August 2014, Walls was living in retirement. Although Walls has yet to be approached by a game developer, he remains hopeful of making Precinct in the future.

It is in the Flinders Ranges Council, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey. At the 2016 census, the locality had a population of 341 of which 237 lived in its town centre. History The town was surveyed during March 1880 and was proclaimed on 1 July 1880. It was named after G. C. Hawker who was a member of the South Australian Parliament for the years 1858-1865 and 1875-1883. The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Towns of Wonoka, Hawker and Chapmanton. Portions of Hawker were added to the adjoining localities of Flinders Ranges and Shaggy Ridge on 26 November 2013. Hawker was a thriving railway town from the 1880s until 1956 as it was on the Central Australia Railway, until the route was moved further west when the Marree railway line was opened. =Establishment and Naming= The State Library of South Australia Place Names list gives this account of the naming of the town. \\"Hawker - George Charles Hawker was born in London, in 1819, the second son of Admiral Edward Hawker and, after his arrival in South Australia in the Lysander in September 1840, ran sheep in the Nuriootpa district and, in 1841, established the ‚ÄòBungaree Run‚Äô with two brothers. Entering parliament in 1858, he became Speaker in 1860, returned to England in 1865 and, apart from a short return visit, remained there until 1874. Upon his return to the colony he re-entered the political arena in 1875, retiring in 1883. Hawker Hill, west of Lake Frome, was named by John McDouall Stuart on 2 June 1859; Mount Hawker, South-West of Lake Eyre South, was named by John McDouall Stuart on 1 July 1861. The town of Hawker was proclaimed on 1 July 1880 and its sale occasioned very spirited bidding particularly for ‚Äòblocks near the railway station favourably placed for hotels and shops‚Äô: The supreme site was the large corner (Lot 470) on which the Royal Hotel (now Hawker Hotel) was erected later, and this brought the top price of ¬£246. Lot 473 on which William Powell erected a hotel later named the ‚ÄòWonoka‚Äô brought ¬£147. The storekeepers H. Gadd and G. Jackson paid, respectively, ¬£72 (Lot 415) and ¬£100 (Lot 391) for good sites facing the railway close to the station. While most of Hawker remained simply pegged-out blocks of bluebush, the ‚Äòtop end‚Äô of the town, where business activity was concentrated, must have been as animated as an ant colony. Hammering could be heard all day long for initially all of the buildings were of wood and iron. There was keen competition to be first with any business service to the public. Constantly teams of horses, bullocks, donkeys, and even camels converged upon, or radiated from, the town, raising the dust in that dry year of 1880.\\" http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/digitalpubs/placenamesofsouthaustralia/H.pdf =Heritage listings= Hawker has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 20 Cradock Road: St Philip and St James Catholic Church * Hawker-Wilpena Road: Mount Desire Dyke * Wonoka-Hawker Road: Hawker railway station * 1885 Hawker Dam Economy The main economic activities in the area are tourism and pastoral runs of sheep and increasingly cattle. Due to the arid environment, the stocking rates are low, at about one sheep per three to four hectares. Hawker is south of Wilpena Pound, a unique natural dish- shaped range of hills popular with tourists, as well as the spectacular scenery of the Flinders Ranges. Tourism Hawker Racing Club holds a once a year Thoroughbred horse racing meeting which includes the Hawker Cup in late May which attracts many people from around the area. Climate Hawker has a semi-arid climate with hot summers and cool winters. Rainfall is very sparse throughout the year, but more reliable in the winter months. {  } See also *Hawker (disambiguation) References  External links  * Official Hawker website * Flinders Ranges website - Hawker * Aussie Towns - Hawker Towns in South Australia Flinders Ranges Far North (South Australia) ","title":"Hawker, South Australia"},{"id":"1789231","text":"Harvard Heights is a densely populated, mixed-income neighborhood of 20,000+ people in Central Los Angeles, California.

In some traditions, they are conceived as an aspect of deity. Although the number of tattvas varies depending on the philosophical school, together they are thought to form the basis of all our experience. The Samkhya philosophy uses a system of 25 tattvas, while Shaivism recognises 36 tattvas. In Buddhism, the equivalent is the list of dhammas which constitute reality. Etymology Tattva () is a Sanskrit word meaning 'thatness', 'principle', 'reality' or 'truth'.\\"tattva - of the truth\\" from BG 2.16 Jainism Jain philosophy can be described in various ways, but the most acceptable tradition is to describe it in terms of the tattvas or fundamentals. Without knowing them one cannot progress towards liberation. According to major Jain text, Tattvarthsutra, these are: # Jiva - Souls and living things # Ajiva - Non-living things # Asrava - Influx of karma # Bandha - The bondage of karma # Samvara - The stoppage of influx of karma # Nirjara - Shedding of karma # Moksha - Liberation or Salvation Each one of these fundamental principles are discussed and explained by Jain scholars in depth.Mehta, T.U. Path of Arhat - A Religious Democracy, Volume 63 Page 112, Faridabad: Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, 1993. There are two examples that can be used to explain the above principle intuitively. * A man rides a wooden boat to reach the other side of the river. Now the man is Jiva, the boat is ajiva. Now the boat has a leak and water flows in. That incoming of water is Asrava and accumulating there is Bandha. Now the man tries to save the boat by blocking the hole. That blockage is Samvara and throwing the water outside is Nirjara. Now the man crosses the river and reaches his destination, Moksha. * Consider a family living in a house. One day, they were enjoying a fresh cool breeze coming through their open doors and windows of the house. However, the weather suddenly changed to a terrible dust storm. The family, realizing the storm, closed the doors and windows. But, by the time they could close all the doors and windows some of the dust had been blown into the house. After closing the doors and the windows, they started clearing the dust that had come in to make the house clean again. This simple scenario can be interpreted as follows: # Jivas are represented by the living people. # Ajiva is represented by the house. # Asrava is represented by the influx of dust. # Bandha is represented by the accumulation of dust in the house. # Samvara is represented by the closing of the doors and windows to stop the accumulation of dust. # Nirjara is represented by the cleaning up of already collected dust from the house. # Moksha is represented by the cleaned house, which is similar to the shedding off all karmic particles from the soul. Buddhism In Buddhism the term dhamma/dharma is being used for the constitutional elements. Early Buddhist philosophy used several lists, such as namarupa and the five skandhas, to analyse reality. The Abhidhamma tradition elaborated on these lists, using over 100 terms to analyse reality. Samkhya The Samkhya philosophy regards the Universe as consisting of two eternal realities: Purusha and Prakrti. It is therefore a strongly dualist philosophy. The Purusha is the centre of consciousness, whereas the Prakriti is the source of all material existence. The twenty-five tattva system of Samkhya concerns itself only with the tangible aspect of creation, theorizing that Prakriti is the source of the world of becoming. It is the first tattva and is seen as pure potentiality that evolves itself successively into twenty-four additional tattvas or principles. Theistic traditions =Kashmir Shaivism= In Kashmir Shaivism the tattvas are inclusive of consciousness as well as material existence. The 36 tattvas of Shaivism are divided into three groups: ;Shuddha tattvas :The first five tattvas are known as the shuddha or 'pure' tattvas. They are also known as the tattvas of universal experience. ;Shuddha-ashuddha tattvas :The next seven tattvas (6-12) are known as the shuddha-ashuddha or 'pure-impure' tattvas. They are the tattvas of limited individual experience. ;Ashuddha tattvas :The last twenty-four tattvas (13-36) are known as the ashuddha or 'impure' tattvas. The first of these is prakriti and they include the tattvas of mental operation, sensible experience, and materiality. =Gaudiya Vaishnavism= Within Puranic literatures and general Vaishnava philosophy tattva is often used to denote certain categories or types of being or energies such as: ;Krishna-tattva :The Supreme personality of Godhead.

In Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy there are a total of five primary tattvas described in terms of living beings, which are collectively known as the Pancha Tattva and described as follows: Tantra Air is blue circle. Earth is yellow square. Fire is red triangle. Water is silver crescent. Spirit is the black egg.

A common scenario is where the two individuals function in proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension does not have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it. Sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had sexual relations and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship. Sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.  In fiction  Sexual tension is a common feature in works of fiction. This longing is often suggested by incidents of intimacy; for example, when two characters are alone and in proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction. Sexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.

It is one of two Hannay novels set during the First World War, the other being Greenmantle (1916); Hannay's first and best-known adventure, The Thirty-Nine Steps (1915), is set in the period immediately before the war started. The title refers to a character in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, to which there are many other references in the novel; Hannay uses a copy of Pilgrim's Progress to decipher coded messages from his contacts, and letters from his friend Peter Pienaar. Plot introduction During the later years of the First World War Brigadier- General Hannay is recalled from active service on the Western Front to undertake a secret mission hunting for a dangerous German agent at large in Britain. Hannay is required to work undercover disguised as a pacifist, roaming the country incognito to investigate a German spy and his agents, and then heads to the Swiss Alps to save Europe from being overwhelmed by the German army. Plot summary = Part One = Dick Hannay, under forty and already a successful Brigadier-General with good prospects of advancement, is called out of uniform by his old comrade, spymaster Sir Walter Bullivant, and sent to Fosse Manor in the Cotswolds to receive further instructions. He must pose as a South African, an objector to the war, and once more takes on the name Cornelius Brand (an Anglicisation of the name he had used on his adventures in Germany in Greenmantle). He is upset by the idea of such a pose, but comforted by thoughts of his friend Peter Pienaar, briefly a successful airman and now a prisoner in Germany, and by the beauty of the Cotswold countryside. At Fosse, he meets two middle-aged spinsters, their cousin Launcelot Wake, a conscientious objector, and their niece Mary Lamington, a girl whose prettiness had struck Hannay earlier, while visiting a shell- shocked friend in the hospital where she works. It emerges that she is his contact, but she can tell him little more than that he must immerse himself in the world of pacifists and objectors, picking up \\"atmosphere\\". She gives him a label to paste inside his watch, an address where he will be staying, and advises him to pick up a copy of Pilgrim's Progress. However, Mary gives Hannay some inkling of the gravity of his mission; \\"You and I and some hundred others are hunting the most dangerous man in all the world\\". Hannay heads to Biggleswick, a small town full of artists and writers. He buries himself in their pacifist community, attending meetings at a local hall, and meets Moxon Ivery, a local bigwig who seems vaguely familiar; he also sees Mary about the place. He hears of his old comrade John Blenkiron, and one day the American appears at one of the town's meetings; he passes a message to Hannay, arranging to meet in London. Blenkiron reveals that he has been hard at work for some time, around the world and undercover around England, on the track of a huge network of German spies and agents, with their head somewhere in Britain, leaking vital information to the enemy. He believes Ivery to be the spider at the centre of the web, but cannot prove it, and wants to use Ivery to feed misinformation to the Germans. He tells Hannay to try and head for Scotland and an American called Gresson, as he believes the information is being sent that way. Hannay goes to Glasgow, and contacts a trade union man named Amos, through whom he moves into Gresson's circles. He speaks at a meeting which descends into violence, and finds himself in at Gresson's side in a street fight. He saves the day, but makes an enemy of a big Fusilier named Geordie Hamilton. He later learns that Gresson makes regular boat trips up the coast, and plans to tag along. He rides the foul boat, but realises he needs a passport to go all the way north, and must follow it on shore, dodging the law. He has a hint from his contact that a mine at a place called Ranna may be what he seeks, and hears the boat stops at an iron mine, so he resolves to head that way. He leaves the boat and treks inland, but soon finds he is wanted by the law, and is caught by some soldiers. He claims to be a soldier too, and their Colonel takes him home with him, to meet his son to check his story; the son confirms all Hannay's army knowledge, and suspicions are allayed. He moves on, staying overnight with peasants, making his way onto Skye and towards Ranna. Arriving there, he meets Amos, who goes to fetch supplies, and sees the boat and Gresson, who meets a stranger on the hill. Hannay tracks the foreign-looking stranger, who Hannay describes as 'The Portuguese Jew', to a rocky bay, where the man disappears for a time before heading back. Hannay stays there overnight, and next morning fetches his provisions and searches the beach, finding the deep water of the bay ideal for submarines. He finds a hidden cave, and while preparing to lay in wait there sees Launcelot Wake climbing in. They fight and Hannay ties the other man up, but they soon realise they are on the same side. They stake out the cave, and in the night the man Hannay followed returns, meeting with a German from the sea; they exchange pass-phrases, and Hannay sees the hiding place they plan to use to pass messages. Wake identifies some of their talk as extracts from Goethe, and is sent back with messages for Amos and Bullivant, while Hannay ponders the phrases he overheard - Bommaerts, Chelius, Elfenbein ('Ivory', homophone of 'Ivery'), Wild Bird and Caged Bird. He heads for home, but Amos warns him the police are still after him, and gives him a new disguise, as a travelling bookseller. On the way south he takes up with another salesman, a man named Linklater who Amos had seen with Gresson. In a small town, Hannay is recognised by Geordie Hamilton, the big soldier he fought with in Glasgow, and flees once more with half the town, including Linklater, on his tail. He hides out in a troop train heading south; he gets off when it stops, is seen by Linklater, but at the station hooks up with his old pal Archie Roylance, a pilot who flies him on southwards. The plane breaks down, and Hannay, still pursued, flees afoot once more, upsetting a film set, stealing a bicycle and making his way into another town. On the verge of capture, his watch is stolen, and he is dragged off the streets by a man who recognises the badge he carries there; he is given a soldier's outfit and sent on his way. He arrives in London in the midst of an air raid; in a tube station he sees Ivery, the spymaster's guard down in fear, and Hannay finally recognises him as one of the \\"Black Stone\\" men he had tangled with in The Thirty-Nine Steps. Hurrying to tell his colleagues, he is arrested as a deserter and delayed. He eventually gets word through to Macgillivray at Scotland Yard, but his enemy has two hours start and evades capture. Hannay is encouraged by a letter from Peter Pienaar, and at a meeting with Bullivant, Blenkiron and Mary, he pushes for them to hound the man down. They discuss the clues Hannay overheard on the beach, and Ivery's fear of the bombing, and Mary reveals that Ivery has proposed to her. = Part Two = Hannay returns to the war in Europe for several months. He finds Geordie Hamilton, and employs him as his batman; he runs into Launcelot Wake, working as a support labourer behind the lines; he sees several adverts in English and German newspapers, which he suspects may be some kind of coded communication. Hamilton reports having seen Gresson in a party of touring visitors, and Hannay learns he had stayed behind in a small village for a time; he later hears a story of mysterious goings-on at a chateau near the same village. Flying with Archie Roylance on a reconnoitre, they get lost in fog and land near the chateau in question, where Hannay sees a mysterious old woman in a gas mask. Finding the castle is in a vital strategic spot, he returns to investigate, and learns the place is leased by a man named Bommaerts, one of the words he had overheard on the beach in Skye. Sneaking into the house at night, he finds Mary there too, and learns she has seen Ivery, now calling himself Bommaerts, who is in love with her. They find anthrax powder and a newspaper with one of the adverts deciphered, and then Ivery arrives. Confronted by Hannay, he flees, and Hannay shoots after him; the chateau burns down. A few days later, in January 1918, Hannay is withdrawn from the front for more special duties. Blenkiron gives dinner for Hannay and Mary, now engaged, where he learns that the newspaper advert scam has been broken up and its operatives, led by Gresson, arrested. Blenkiron has found a second code in the messages, used by Ivery and his masters, and has identified Ivery as the Graf von Schwabing, a former high-flyer unseated by scandal. He hears of the Wild Birds, a ruthless and deadly band of German spies, of whom Ivery is a leading member, and learns that they plan to head to Switzerland to pin Ivery down, using Mary as bait. Hannay makes his way south to Switzerland, where he poses as an injured Swiss, servant to the crippled Peter Pienaar, who has been released there. The two catch up, swap stories, and await instructions, keeping an eye on the nearby Pink Chalet, believed to be the base of the Wild Birds. Finally receiving Blenkiron's instructions, Hannay goes one night to the chalet, where he meets his contact, but is betrayed and taken prisoner by von Schwabing. The German tells Hannay he plans to capture Mary too, and send them both back to Germany to deal with at his pleasure, while the German army attacks and crushes their enemies. Von Schwabing leaves him pinned in an ancient rack, but he breaks free. He runs into the man he followed across Skye, and, using the pass-phrases he overheard there, poses as a conspirator. He is provided with a car and chases after von Schwabing, sending Peter to alert the others. After a long drive through the mountains, he crashes the car and runs the rest of the way, but arrives to find Mary already gone and Launcelot Wake waiting for him. Learning that von Schwabing is returning to the chalet the long way, they resolve to head over the mountains on foot, cutting out much of the road. Wake, an experienced mountaineer, leads a tough climb through snow and ice, exhausting himself in the process. Hannay drags him to the safety of a cottage, then continues by train and again on foot. He arrives at the house, and staggers in, to see von Schwabing gloating over Blenkiron, who appears to have walked into the same trap Hannay had the night before. However, Blenkiron was warned by Hannay's message, and has the house in his command; Geordie Hamilton and Amos emerge and take von Schwabing prisoner. At Hannay's suggestion, von Schwabing is sent to the front to see battle, while the others head to Paris, just as the Germans begin a mighty attack. As they near the front, they hear the defenses are crumbling beneath the onslaught, with Hannay's men at the heart of things. He resumes his command, and holds a thin line against the German advance, with Wake running messages for him, Blenkiron engineering the reserve trenches and Mary nursing in a nearby hospital. Amos and Hamilton guard von Schwabing, whose mind has gone strange. A long and hard battle ensues, in the course of which Wake dies heroically, von Schwabing runs into No Man's Land and is shot by his countrymen, and Blenkiron joins the fray with a party of Americans. At the last, with reinforcements due any moment, a party of German planes overflies Hannay's position, and are sure to bear news of the weak point if allowed to return; British planes fly against them, but one, flown by flying ace Lensch, evades them. Peter Pienaar, flying Archie Roylance's plane despite his bad leg, flies into him, bringing him down and killing himself in the process, but the day is saved.

It is a key tributary of the Godavari. The river flows south in a winding course through the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, roughly . After joining the Wardha River, the united stream, which is known as the Pranahita River, empties into the Godavari River at Kaleshwaram, Telangana.  Course  The main stream of the Wainhanga originates at Mahadev hills near Gopalganj, Seoni District, on the southern slopes of the Satpura Range of Madhya Pradesh. The river has developed extensive floodplains characterized by sweeping graceful meanders, low alluvial flats, and slip-off slopes. The river has high banks, which measure from to on either side. The northern part is surrounded by the Mahadeo hills and Satpura Range, with an average elevation of 625 m (2,051 ft) above sea level. The valley of the Wainganga River is forested and sparsely populated. Balaghat and Bhandara are the major cities located on the bank of the Wainganga River, while Pauni and Desaiganj are smaller urban centers on the smallest of the river banks. The Wainganga River is the water lifeline of these cities and their primary source of water. The Government of Maharashtra is developing a protection wall for Bhandara to protect it from heavy flooding. This flood protection wall encircles Bhandara from east to south. = Tributaries = The Wainganga river receives numerous tributaries on both sides and drains the western, central, and eastern regions of the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia, and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra. The main tributaries of the Wainganga River are the Thel, Thanwar, Bagh, Chulband, Garhavi, Khobragadi, and Kathani, which meet on the left bank; and the Hirri, Chandan, Bawanthari, Kanhan, and Mul joining on the right bank. Thanwar The Thanwar River joins the Wainganga at the Nainpur Forest Range, at the border of the Seoni District and Mandla District, before the Dhuty Dam on the Wainganga. It originates from the forest of Chiraidongri in the Mandla District. There is a medium-sized dam at the village of Bejegaon on the bank of this river, which opened in 1980. River water stored in the dam is used to irrigate the farmland of 50 villages. The Halon River\\"Web page of Govt. Of India Website:india-wris.nrsc.gov.in\\" and the Chakor River (catchment from Nainpur Forest Range) are some of the well-known tributaries to this small, fully utilized river. Geographically, this river misses a few miles due to a Satpura foothill to become the Narmada's first major tributary. The main towns on this tributary are Nainpur and Pindrai. The river has been in recreational use since ancient times, as it was on the route of pilgrimage from South to North India. The village Jhulpur,\\"Govt. Museum at Mandla District\\" on the bank of this river, was a stoppage and temple town. The major bridge over the river is at the town Pindrai by Indian Railway (Jabalpur-Gondia rail track). Kathani The Kathani River originates in the Pendhri Hills at Dhanora and joins Wainganga near Gadchiroli city. Hirri The Hirri River originates in Moondapar, Seoni District and flows through Jeonara. It joins Wainganga near the Dhuty Dam. Chandan The Chandan River is an important river of the Balaghat District. It flows through Waraseoni. The Nahalesara dam is built upon the Chandan River. One of the major features along the river is the Rampayali's temple.his meet in vainganga river in Maharashtra mahalgaon (Murdara) village Bawanthadi The Bawanthadi River is an important river which originates in the Kurai plateau of Seoni District in Madhya Pradesh. It divides Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra near Mowad and Bonkatta. The Bawanthadi River joins Wainganga after flowing 48 km south, near Mowad, Madhya Pradesh.There is a middle size dam over this river which irrigate farm lands of M.P. and Maharastra. Kanhan The Kanhan River is Wainganga's longest tributary, at 275 km (171 mi). It rises in the hills at the southern edge of the Satpura Range in the north-western region of Chhindwara District.  River modifications  By 2012, there were about 149 dams built in the Wainganga basin. Gose Khurd Dam on Wainganga River is being built by the Water Resources Department (WRD) of the Government of Maharashtra. One of the major features along the river is the Bheemgarh Dam (the biggest mud dam in Asia), which is located in the Seoni District. Economy The river is used for shipping both goods and passengers under the National Waterways Project (NAWAD). The first river port is likely to have been established in Bhandara City.thumb Literature Wainganga River was used in The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book (1894‚Äì1895) by Rudyard Kipling, featuring in the \\"Mowgli stories.\\" In the books, it is the primary source of water for all the people of the jungle, the location of the \\"Peace Rock,\\" and the place where Shere Khan vows to place Mowgli's bones once he has killed him. It is also the final battleground in the \\"Red Dog,\\" written by Kipling. The forests of the Kanha National Park, which grew around the Wainganga, have tiger, leopard, and bear populations, as featured in Kipling's stories.

This RCA Victor CD features most of the songs recorded by Mario Lanza for the 1954 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Student Prince. These include several that would become closely identified with the tenor: \\"Serenade,\\" \\"Drink! Drink! Drink!,\\" \\"Beloved,\\" and \\"I'll Walk With God.\\" The last two selections are not by Sigmund Romberg, the original composer of The Student Prince, but were written especially for the film version by Nicholas Brodszky and Paul Francis Webster. Generally regarded as being among Lanza's finest renditions of English-language songs, The Student Prince was recorded in 1952, with one remake (\\"Beloved\\") in May 1953. For contractual reasons, the singing of soprano Ann Blyth (who originally sang with Lanza on two of the numbers) has been replaced by that of Elizabeth Doubleday on this disc. Constantine Callinicos was appointed Mario Lanza's musical director for the film, and most of the soundtrack recordings were made with Constantine Callinocos conducting the MGM Orchestra. The second half of the CD consists of highlights from another Romberg operetta, The Desert Song. Recorded in Rome in August and September 1959 at a time when Lanza was recovering from a bout of double pneumonia, these are the tenor's final recordings. He died on October 7, 1959, shortly after the recordings were made. Lanza is accompanied here on several selections by soprano Judith Raskin, who recorded her contributions in New York a year after the tenor's death.

It confirmed that Salic Law was to operate in favor of all the agnatic lines of the family, specifically the two senior surviving lines which had originated in the Middle Ages, the Walramian and the Ottonian. The pact chiefly provided that in case of one of these lines becoming extinct, the other would succeed in its hereditary Nassau lands (\\"the main concept of the pact was that if either the Ottonian or Walramian male line would become extinct the other line would succeed\\"). There was a clause to provide for a so-called Semi-Salic continuation to the dynasty in an undefined way if both the lines were to die out in the male line (\\"also arranged for that in the absence of all male successors, females could succeed\\"). In case of the extinction of all male lines, the closest heir to the last male will succeed and in turn will be succeeded by the heirs of that closest one. If the closest heir happens to be a woman, the pact was silent about whether her husband receives rights or not. There was no precise stipulation as to what precisely was to happen after that closest heir: would the succession evolve to heirs general, or only to heirs male, and what would happen if that line also died out. The pact was agreed to be applied to \\"Imperial fiefs\\" which meant those territories owned or acquired in the then Holy Roman Empire. The pact thus in 1890 determined the succession of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a territory acquired into the dynasty only after the pact was sealed, but in exchange for the handing of some of the Nassau-lands of the Ottonian branch to Prussia and that at the time became a member of the German Confederation, a body that was regarded as the successor to the Holy Roman Empire. The pact did not apply to the succession in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a state not regarded as formerly imperial. Luxembourg was thus inherited by the Weilburg branch, the only extant branch from that date onward. In 1907, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, William IV, head of the House of Nassau, determined that the branch of the Count of Merenberg was, as morganatic, incapable to succeed to the sovereignty of the House of Nassau. This effectively meant that the Grand Duke himself was then the only surviving agnate of the House. Having himself only daughters, he felt the need to organize the succession further and remedy some of the undefined points. In April 1907 the Grand Duke decreed (approved in July 1907 by legislature of Luxembourg and thereafter enacted) amendments to the house law of Nassau. The succession law thus amended governs the current succession in Luxembourg, and apparently the succession specifically provided by the pact itself is fulfilled and its impact is exhausted. Marie-Ad√©la√Øde succeeded according to the 1907 law, an outcome that was identical with the stipulations of the pact. Were any successions of the House of Nassau outside Luxembourg to need to be adjudicated afterwards, it is unclear what the pact would provide ‚Äî whether a line identical with that of modern Luxembourg's, or different.

Originally an ethnic slur, the term has been embraced by a subculture related to prison gangs and outlaw motorcycle clubs. The term originates in Jive and was in use as an inversion of woodpecker by the 1830s, with the sense referring to white people documented from the 1850s. African- American folklore in the 1920s contrasted the white \\"peckerwood\\" bird with the African-American blackbird. History Use of the term, an inversion of woodpecker, dates to the early 19th century. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the earliest printed use to an Alabama newspaper in 1835. Peckerwood was in use in reference to white people by 1859; it often suggested a white person who was rustic or poor. The shortened form peck was in use in the same sense in the 1920s. In African-American folklore during the 1920s, the woodpecker symbolically represented white people, in contrast to the blackbird that represented African-Americans. Subculture Historically, the term \\"peckerwood\\" was commonly applied to white prisoners in general. The cemetery at Leavenworth Penitentiary, officially known as Mount Hope, is informally known as \\"Peckerwood Hill\\" by prisoners and guards. In the later half of the 20th century the term narrowed to apply to a white subculture associated with street gangs and prison gangs, such as the Aryan Brotherhood. This subculture is also known as PW, P-Dub, or collectively as \\"the Woodpile\\". Men in this group are called \\"peckerwoods\\" and women \\"featherwoods\\". The woodpecker is often used as a general symbol for the group, such as in prison tattoos. It is usually drawn with a long beak, sometimes drawn to resemble Woody Woodpecker or Mr. Horsepower. Sometimes the letters \\"PW\\" or \\"APW\\" (Peckerwood and American Peckerwood) are used. The term is also used for entry-level recruits of the Aryan Brotherhood. Within the prison system, peckerwoods may advance in the social hierarchy and become formal members of the gang, or similar gangs such as the Nazi Lowriders. Becoming a higher-ranking member involves the act of committing more and more serious crimes. Peckerwood is also used by some prison systems as a generic name for any white supremacist threat group, which has sometimes been a source of confusion. In and out of prison, the peckerwood subculture is most common in California, Texas and the U.S. south and southwest, but less in the midwest and northeast. Much of the peckerwood prison subculture had its beginnings in the desegregation of United States prisons. Aryan Brotherhood had its beginnings in the San Quentin State Prison in 1964 as a response to the newly formed black prison gang Black Guerilla Family.Coverson, Laura. \\"Aryan Brotherhood Tried for 40 Years of Prison Mayhem\\". ABC News. March 15, 2006. Retrieved October 27, 2006.David Grann. \\"The Brand\\", The New Yorker, February 16, 2004, collected in The Devil and Sherlock Holmes (2010). The San Quentin State Aryan Brotherhood uses the gang Family Affiliated Irish Mafia (FAIM) for its street-operated activity. The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was formed in the 80s after the dismantling of the \\"building tender\\" system in which groups were segregated. ABT originally formed as a hybrid of the two gangs Aryan Society and Aryan Brothers. In 1985, the Aryan Circle formed out of peckerwoods who didn't join the newly formed Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. Aryan Circle members believed ABT didn't truly stand for white supremacy. Fronted by Mark \\"Cowboy\\" Gaspard, the group was originally called Aryan Christians but changed its name due to members' varying beliefs. A group known as the \\"International Peckerwood Syndicate\\" has been listed by in the Oregon Department of Justice as operating in Oregon prisons. According to the ADL, the group, also known as the \\"Insane Peckerwood Syndicate\\", formed in 2005 and also has a presence in Washington State. Other prison gangs using the term \\"peckerwood\\" as part of their name have been documented in Connecticut, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico. On May 4, 2013, Charles Gaskin, who was a member of the gang according to his probation report, was sentenced for 26 years to life for the murder of registered sex offender Neil Lee Hayes. According to the report, Gaskin was required to physically harm a white person with a history of child molestation under \\"peckerwood law\\". =Street gangs= The peckerwood subculture has established street gangs that mix elements from white power skinhead culture and conventional street gang activity, such as illegal drugs. These \\"Peckerwood\\" street gangs generally form in lower-income white neighborhoods. These gangs are the manifestation of a modern \\"white power\\" subculture that combines the elements of California Latino culture, extreme sports and cannabis subculture. Stylistically these gangs combine elements of Latino gang culture (Pendleton flannel and baggy pants) and skinhead culture (Doc Marten boots, bomber jackets, and shaved heads). As well, Peckerwood gang members identify with the color white and are known for wearing white caps and handkerchiefs. The most common gang sign for Peckerwoods is forming the thumb, index finger and middle finger of the right hand to form the letter \\"P,\\" and the four fingers of the left to form the letter \\"W\\". Many of these Peckerwood gangs in California are subservient to the authority of Nazi Lowriders, which includes the punk gangs Vicious Circle and La Mirada Punks, as well as Insane White Boys, Independent Skins, Orange County Skins, and a rigid alliance with Southern California Skinhead Alliance (SoCal Skins). Leading the alliance with Nazi Lowriders, the Peckerwood gang Public Enemy No. 1 (PEN1) was established in Long Beach, California during the late 80s, and known for recruiting middle-class \\"latchkey kids\\" within the Southern California punk scene. PEN1 also known by its derivative Peni Death Squad, gained establishment as a Peckerwood gang in the late 90s in Orange County, being recruited by the Nazi Lowriders. Members of PEN1 also established a regional chapter of the straight edge street gang FSU (Fuck Shit Ups) in Huntington Beach as well. In 1993, the gang Insane White Boys (IWB) was incepted in Orange County and came into prominence being recruited by the Nazi Lowriders as well. The smaller gangs such as Public Enemy No. 1 and Insane White Boys are considered \\"kids\\" within the Peckerwood gang world, where as Nazi Lowrider groups are led by \\"seniors\\" who induct \\"kids\\" into membership. A kid can become a \\"junior\\", and a junior can become a senior if elected by three other seniors. Within the U.S. court system, membership within a Peckerwood group has not always been accepted as indicating the existence of a larger Peckerwood gang. Peckerwood groups tend to lack a constitution, and to be more loosely organized than formal gangs. The Smalltown Peckerwoods, a gang of about a hundred members on the U.S. West Coast, was not ruled to be part of a larger Peckerwood organization in the 2008 People v. Williams case, as the main commonalities were ideology and the name, rather than organizational. is also the name of a Santee, California- based outlaw motorcycle club formed in 1987. According to local police, the club's patches and clothing include Nazi imagery, and members have been associated with hate crimes, although the club has denied that it is racist.

It emerged from the dance parties of S√£o Paulo's lower-class black communities after they had been exposed to rock and roll and African-American music in the late 1950s. As a development of 1960s m√∫sica popular brasileira, the genre was pioneered by recording acts such as Jorge Ben, Tim Maia, and Trio Mocot√≥. It gained a wider popularity in the following decades after breaking through into discotheques. By the 2000s, samba rock had grown into a broader cultural movement involving dancers, disc jockeys, scholars, and musicians, who reinvented the genre in a modernized form.  Origins  A street in the S√£o Paulo favela of Heli√≥polis Samba rock's origins lie in the predominantly black favelas of S√£o Paulo during the late 1950s, when Brazilian radio and dance halls were reached by the global spread of American rock and roll and related African-American music such as blues and jazz. Its first incarnation was as a dance phenomenon at community block parties that began to play these styles alongside traditional samba and bolero music. These parties eventually moved to larger venues hosted by disc jockeys. The first known samba-rock deejay Osvaldo Pereira‚Äîknown by his stage name \\"Orquestra Invis√≠vel (Invisible Orchestra) Let‚Äôs Dance\\"‚Äîdebuted in 1958 in downtown S√£o Paulo. \\"The parties started to get crowded, and the rooms for the parties started to get larger\\", Pereira recounted. \\"Then, I thought of building my own equipment, which had to be powerful, and faithful to the sound of the live orchestras.\\" His early equipment included a 100-watt sound system featuring a rudimentary version of a crossover, which allowed Pereira to control the frequencies of the music.  Dance culture  In the earliest samba-rock parties, deejays played music from a number of genres, including Partido Alto sambas and Italian rock, while attendees joined in pairs and engaged in rock and roll (Lindy Hop, Rockabilly) and samba dances (Samba de Gafieira). In 1957, Brazilian pianist Waldir Calmon recorded a samba version of Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\", which was a turning point for the events; according to Brazilian journalist Beatriz Miranda, \\"gradually, partygoers turned all the rock and samba moves into one single dance style, later named samba rock.\\" The dances of samba rock honor an exchange between the original music and a variety of other styles, according to Mestre Ataliba, one of S√£o Paulo's first samba-rock dance instructors. \\"Dance wise, samba rock is about relaxation and concentration, all at once\\", he said. \\"It blends the African 'ginga' (body flow from Capoeira), which is present at the feet and the hips, and the European reference of the ballroom etiquette. We can dance it to the sound of Rita Pavone, samba pagode, reggae, R&B.; It really embraces every music culture\\".  Musical development  Jorge Ben in 1972 The samba-rock genre developed during the 1960s with popular Brazilian recording musicians who fused samba with American rock, soul, and funk influences.; . This development occurred alongside the Tropic√°lia artistic movement within mid-1960s m√∫sica popular brasileira (MPB), which itself had modernized traditional bossa nova rhythms with influences from other Brazilian and international pop rock sounds. Originators of samba rock included Trio Mocot√≥, Tim Maia, and Jorge Ben, who has been considered the \\"father of samba rock\\".; ; . Ben's early music contributed significantly to the genre's rhythmic identity. Departing from bossa nova's European musical influences, the singer drew on African- American styles‚Äîsuch as jazz, rhythm and blues, and eventually soul, funk, and rock music‚Äîto develop a unique rhythm, which he called \\"sacundin sacunden\\". Stylistically, Ben combined samba with instruments and features from rock and roll, including the electric guitar, drum kit, and reverberation. According to Impose magazine's Jacob McKean, \\"the horn-heavy big band sound\\" on the song \\"Take It Easy My Brother Charles\\" (from Ben's 1969 self-titled album) is a key element of the genre. His 1970 album F√¥r√ßa Bruta, recorded with Trio Mocot√≥, was also pioneering of samba rock in its fusion of the band's groove-based accompaniment and the more rockish rhythms of Ben's guitar. Their instrumental set-ups during the 1970s often featured guitar, the pandeiro, and the timbau, a traditional drum. Many other musicians emulated and expanded on Ben's style. Their sound became known as samba rock; it has also been referred to as samba soul, samba funk, and sambalan√ßo (a portmanteau of samba and balan√ßo, meaning swing or beat in Portuguese).; ; . The genre became defined by the drum kit, bass guitar, keyboard, brass instruments, a strong groove, and \\"tumxicutumxicutum\\", an onomatopoeia referring to samba rock's distinctive rhythm. According to Clube do Balan√ßo vocalist and guitarist Marco Mattoli, \\"the song must always be good to dance to, otherwise it does not make sense. It does limit the composing process, but creates a cultural identity to our band. Today, we cannot see it as rock, samba, soul or funk anymore. Samba rock turned into an original thing.\\"  Popularity and modernization  Samba rock reached mainstream audiences in the late 1960s. It became more popular during the 1970s and 1980s, especially in discotheques. This gave more exposure to Ben, Trio Mocot√≥, and other acts from S√£o Paulo's black music scene, although none of them declared themselves samba-rock artists. Ben's songs in particular became enduring favorites at traditional samba-rock parties. In subsequent years, samba rock developed from a dance phenomenon and music style into a complex cultural movement, involving musicians, producers, DJs, dancers, visual artists, and scholars. The parties eventually came to include big bands and hip hop, alongside samba music. In the early 2000s, the genre was refashioned in a more modernized form featuring electronic samples, departing from the traditional set-up of Ben and Trio Mocot√≥'s 1970s music. This newer form was typified by the bands Sand√°lia de Prata and Clube do Balan√ßo, who first played middle-class areas of S√£o Paulo. The new wave of artists deliberately created music that would suit samba-rock dances. In 2001, Universal Music Brasil capitalized on this resurgence of samba rock with the \\"Samba Soul\\" reissue series, re-releasing albums by Ben and other 1970s performers of the style. Ben, who still performed at this time, was recognized by Time Out as an \\"aging maestro\\" representative of the \\"favela samba rock\\" contingent in the contemporary MPB scene. Samba rock's modernization has seen its incorporation into dance academy curriculum, gym classes, party productions, dance collectives, and other events.; . Samba-rock dance forms of the past were revisited in the 2000s by black Brazilian and dance-club culture, as well as Brazilian hip hop groups such as Soul Sisters. Samba-rock culture has also faced debates surrounding gender equality. An advocacy project, \\"Samba Rock Mulheres\\" (), was created in response to the marginalization of women as supporting dancers to the predominantly male stars at dance events. In 2010, three figures associated with the samba-rock movement‚Äîdancer Jorge Yoshida, musician Marco Mattoli, and producer Nego J√∫nior‚Äîstarted a grassroots campaign to have samba rock registered as a cultural heritage of S√£o Paulo. The campaign eventually attracted the participation of various artists, musical groups, producers, political leaders, and citizens of S√£o Paulo. In November 2016, the Municipal Council of Historic, Cultural and Environmental Preservation of the City of Sao Paulo (CONPRESP) finally declared samba rock a cultural heritage of the municipality.

American Baptist Quarterly. 28, no. 4: 421-440. She served as the association's president from 1887 to 1904; during this time the association made progress in advancing the rights of Native Americans. They supported passage of the Dawes Severalty Act by Congress in 1887, which provided individual households of Native Americans in Indian Territory with portions of land for farming, and United States citizenship. Senator Henry Dawes (R-Massachusetts), sponsor of the act, later said that \\"the new government Indian policy was born of and nursed by this women' association.\\"  Life Amelia Stone was born on July 31, 1833, in Jamesville, New York, near Syracuse, to Mary (n√©e Bennett) and Jacob Thompson Stone. She was tutored by Samuel B. Woolworth in Homer. After Stone married Reverend James Franklin Swanson, they lived in Georgia for several years for his work. He died before her. The widow Stone married Richard L. Quinton in London, who was an astronomy and history lecturer. She took his surname. Stone taught for a year in a Georgia seminary. Following her husband's death, she returned to the North and taught for a year in the Chestnut Street Seminary of Philadelphia. Next she turned to religious and philanthropic work. At first her volunteer work was among the poor of New York City, where she had weekly engagements in various institutions. She served one day of the week was spent in the prison, the almshouse, or the workhouse, and another in some infirmary or reformatory for women. She also provided a weekly Bible-class for sailors. During the first temperance crusade in Brooklyn, she joined the band of workers. She was invited to go out and represent the work, to organize unions, and, a little later, was elected by the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union as State organizer. She went to Europe for a year's rest. After a few months on the continent, she was drawn into temperance work in England and addressed drawing-room and church meetings in London and other cities. On the voyage to England, she met Professor Richard Quinton, a native of London and a lecturer on historical and astronomical subjects. A year later they married in London, where they continued to reside for some months. She returned to America in the autumn of 1878, and together the couple lived in Philadelphia, where Prof. Quinton resumed his lecturing. In April 1879, her friend, Mary L. Bonney, became deeply stirred on the subject of national wrongs to Indians, especially allowing European-American settlement in Indian Territory. She presided over a missionary society which sought to circulate a petition on the subject. The anniversary occasion was already overcrowded with topics, and the petition was not presented or read. A few weeks later Bonney presented more information to Quinton, and they began to plan together. Bonney agreed to supply the means needed for printing, and Quinton to plan and work; she studied in libraries, prepared literature and petitions and circulated them through the sympathizers and helpers she gained in many States. The first petition was enlarged and she prepared a leaflet of facts and special appeal, and sent those out widely to leading citizens, and to women in many kinds of Christian and philanthropic work. Signatures to the petition were returned from thirteen States, and were collected in a roll three hundred-feet-long. This was presented to Congress in February 1880. At the end of that year the pair had organized a committee of eight. At their first meeting Quinton was elected as secretary of the committee. Three months later Bonney was elected chairman. In June 1881 they adopted the constitution drafted by Quinton. was adopted, and the society that day elected an executive board, nominated at her request by the pastors of the churches, and became known as the Indian Treaty- keeping and Protective Association. Quinton began the work of wider organization and organized thirteen associate committees in five states before the close of the year. In the memorial letter which she wrote to accompany the petition of 1881, she petitioned Congress to bring Indians into voluntary citizenship by making that to their interest, rather than by the coercion of acts of Congress. In her petition for January 1882, universal Indian education, lands in severalty, and the full rights of citizenship for Indians were addressed. At that date the society had sixteen State committees, all of which she revisited and reorganized as permanent auxiliaries. A memorable discussion in the Senate over that third petition, which had signatures of a hundred thousand citizens, was closed by Senator Henry L. Dawes. Now known as the Women's National Indian Association, the organization established branches, officers or helpers in forty states. It had founded more than twenty missions in Indian tribes since 1884. During 1891, its missionary work was done in fifteen tribes. After Bonney retired from the presidency of the association, in November 1884, Mary Lowe Dickinson was elected to the office. In 1887 Quinton as unanimously elected president. She bore a government commission and did service also on behalf of Indian education.

A variant of this platform, known as the FN10 (Full-Sized North American Project #10), was used for the 1993‚Äì1998 model year Lincoln Mark VIII from 1992 to 1998. Each car based on this platform had a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout with an independent rear suspension.  Development  1996-1997 Mercury Cougar The roots of the MN12 program began in 1984 when Ford sought to build on the success of the then-current, Fox body-based Thunderbird and Cougar. Going beyond unique styling, Ford wanted to produce a Thunderbird and Cougar that could compete with more sophisticated and higher performing cars from European automakers such as BMW. To accomplish this, Ford needed to develop a new platform since the existing Fox platform couldn't satisfy the requirements of the MN12 program. Heading the program was Anthony \\"Tony\\" S. Kuchta, who was appointed to the position by Ford management in 1986, when formal production program began. Kuchta decided to retain a rear-wheel drive layout for the MN12 platform as a basis for delivering better road performance, as opposed to following the Thunderbird and Cougars' front-wheel drive-based rivals from General Motors, such as the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Regal. Kuchta also approved an independent rear suspension for the MN12 platform, something that would make the Thunderbird and Cougar the only rear- drive domestic cars other than the Chevrolet Corvette (and the later Dodge Viper RT/10) to feature this. Ford engineers working on the MN12 program also explored the use of all-wheel drive for the platform with Ford going so far as paying German automaker Porsche to study the feasibility of its use, but Kuchta ultimately decided against it out of cost concerns.  Overview  1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC MN12 cars had a 113\\" wheelbase and were available with a 3.8L V6 engine, a 3.8L V6 supercharged engine from 1988 to 1995 (1988-1990 in Cougar), a 5.0L V8 engine from 1991 to 1993, and a 4.6L V8 engine from 1994-1997. A 4.6L DOHC V8 engine was used for the FN10 platform Lincoln Mark VIII from 1993 to 1998. = Suspension = The front suspension consists of upper and lower control arms with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform is that the front end has struts; however, since there is an upper control arm they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and lower control arms with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird. All MN12 cars shipped from the factory with a 5 x 4.25\\" (5x108mm) lugnut bolt pattern.

It was founded in 1930 and laid down its arms in 1989. It is most known for its role in the Malayan Emergency. https://www.newmandala.org/chin-peng-an- obituary/ History =Formation= In April 1930 the South Seas Communist Party was dissolved and was replaced by the Communist Party of Malaya.O'Ballance, p.23. While its primary responsibility was Malaya and Singapore, the party was also active in Thailand and the Dutch East Indies, which did not then have their own Communist parties. =Growth= The party operated as an illegal organisation under British colonial rule. In June 1931, many party leaders were arrested after a Comintern courier was intercepted by the police, sending the party into disarray. Information extracted from the courier indicated at this point there were 1,500 members and 10,000 sympathisers.O'Ballance p.24 Despite this setback, the MCP gained influence in the trade union movement and organised several strikes, most notably at the Batu Arang coal mine in 1935. They also set up workers' committees at some workplaces. These committees, and the strikes, were promptly crushed by troops and police. Many ethnic Chinese strikers were deported to China, where they were often executed by the Chinese Nationalist government as Communists.O'Ballance p 25 After Japan invaded China in 1937, there was a rapprochement between the Malayan Kuomintang and Communists, paralleling that in China. Under the wing of the Kuomintang, the MCP was able to operate more easily. Anti-Japanese sentiment among Malayan Chinese gave the party a great opportunity to recruit members and raise funds under the banner of defence of China.O,Ballance, p 28. At this time, the party was infiltrated by an apparent British agent, Lai Teck, who became Secretary-General in April 1939. Despite this severe security breach, the Party continued to operate effectively. By mid-1939 it claimed about 40,000 members, about half in Singapore. =Structure= The MCP was headed by a Central Executive Committee of twelve to fifteen members. About six of these were appointed to the Political Bureau (Politburo) which ran the party when the C.E.C was not in session. Each State had State Central Executive Committee and was in turn subdivided into several Districts. The smallest unit of organisation was the Party cell, which typically consisted of the members from one workplace or village. Large Party Congresses were held on an occasional basis. =World War II= On 8 December 1941, the Japanese Empire invaded Malaya. The British colonial authorities now accepted the MCP's standing offer of military co-operation. On 15 December, all left-wing political prisoners were released. From 20 December the British military began to train party members in guerilla warfare at the hastily established 101st Special Training School (101st STS) in Singapore. About 165 MCP members were trained before the British defences collapsed. These fighters, scantily armed and equipped by the hard-pressed British, hurriedly dispersed and attempted to harass the occupying army. Just before Singapore fell to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, the party began organising armed resistance in the state of Johore. Soon four armed groups, which became known as 'Regiments', were formed, with 101st STS trainees serving as nuclei. In March this force was dubbed the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) and began sabotage and ambushes against the Japanese. The Japanese responded with reprisals against Chinese civilians. These reprisals, coupled with increasing economic hardship, caused large numbers of Malayan Chinese to flee the cities. They became squatters at the forest margins, where they became the main source of recruits, food, and other assistance for the MPAJA. The MPAJA consolidated this support by providing protection. O'Ballance estimates that in mid-1942 the regimental strengths were about 100 in the first Regiment, 160 in the 2nd, 360 in the 3rd, and 250 in the 4th.P. 44. At this time a 5th, 6th, and 7th Regiment were formed. This army, which included women, was conceived as both a military and political force, along Maoist lines. When Singapore fell, Lai Teck was arrested by the Japanese and became their agent. On 1 September 1942, acting on his information, the Japanese launched a dawn raid on a secret conference of more than 100 MCP and MPAJA leaders at the Batu Caves just north of Kuala Lumpur, killing most. The loss of personnel forced the MPAJA to abandon its political commissar system, and the military commanders became the heads of the regiments.O'Ballance, p 49. Following this setback the MPAJA avoided engagements and concentrated on consolidation, amassing 4,500 soldiers by Spring 1943.O'Ballance, p 50. From May 1943, British commandos from Force 136 infiltrated Malaya and made contact with the guerillas. Early in 1944 an agreement was reached whereby the MPAJA would accept some direction from the Allied South East Asia Command (SEAC) and the Allies would give the MPAJA weapons and supplies. It was not until the spring of 1945, however, that significant amounts of material began to arrive by air drop.Cheah,pp 74, 5; Short, p 24. =The war's aftermath= Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945 caught the combatants in Malaya by surprise. The first British contingent of reoccupation troops did not arrive until 3 September; Singapore was reoccupied only on the 8th. The Japanese garrison withdrew from the countryside, leaving a power vacuum that was filled by the MPAJA. In many places, especially Chinese areas, they were greeted as heroes as they emerged from the forest. The British recognised the MPAJA's authority, paying its soldiers for the role in the reoccupation. The guerillas, meanwhile, seized Japanese arms and recruited freely, forming an 8th Regiment and lifting their armed strength over 6,000.O'Ballance, p 61. At the same time they launched reprisals against collaborators in the Malay police force and the civilian population and began to forcibly raise funds.See Cheah, pp 252, 253, 261, 262. Many in the rank and file advocated revolution.O'Ballance, pp 62, 3. The cautious approach which was favoured by Lai Teck and a majority of the leadership prevailed‚Äîa decision which was later viewed as a major missed opportunity.O'Ballance, p 63. On 12 September the British Military Administration (BMA) was installed at Kuala Lumpur. Later that year MPAJA reluctantly agreed to disband. Weapons were handed in at ceremonies where the wartime role of the army was praised.O'Ballance, p. 65. Six thousand eight- hundred soldiers were officially disbanded, but a proportion of weapons were withheld, particularly handguns.Shortp 36. The party was still not legal but able to operate without repression. The MCP adopted a 'National Front' policy, building a broad coalition to work for national independence within legal means. Due to bad economic conditions, the BMA was immediately faced with strikes and demonstrations in which the Communists played an active part. Several were put down by armed force and leaders banished. The MCP also exerted influence through parliamentary parties such as the Malayan Democratic Union (MDU) and the Malay Nationalist Party (MNP).Cheah, p248. In 1946, amid a discontent with the leadership's cautious line, an investigation commenced into rumours of Lai Teck's treachery.Short, p. 39. Before he could be questioned in March 1947, Lai Teck fled the country with party funds.Short, p 39 Badly shaken, the Central Executive Committee kept the defection secret for a year while they struggled to come to terms with it.O'Ballance, p 73, Short,p 41. The 26-year-old Chin Peng was chosen as the new Secretary General. A senior officer in the MPAJA 5th Regiment in Perak, he had been the party's principal liaison with Force 136. The party's stance became more resolutely anti-British. =Malayan Emergency= 200pxAmid a rising atmosphere of tension, the government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations on 12 June 1948. Then on 16 June they declared a state of emergency after three European planters were murdered by Communists in Perak state. The police were given sweeping powers of arrest, and punishments including the death penalty could be administered without an ordinary trial. In the two weeks following hundreds of MCP members were arrested, and the party was declared illegal on 23 July. Party militants regrouped in the jungle as the Malayan Peoples' Anti- British Army (MPABA), many ex-MPAJA personnel. The initial commander, Lau Yew, was killed in action on 16 July. Chin Peng narrowly escaped arrest and rejoined his comrades with difficulty. During this period the MCP also engaged in intimidation, including assassination, of civilians with the aim of coercing material aid, information, and silence. This policy contributed to a loss in popular support and was repudiated by the CEC in September 1951. On 1 February 1949 the MPABA changed its name to 'Malayan Peoples' Liberation Army' (MPLA) and The party began to campaign for a Peoples' Democratic Republic of Malaya, which included Singapore.O'Ballance, p 89. The MPLA had a General Headquarters controlled by a Central Military Committee which consisted of the politburo and some of the MPLA's regimental commanders and political officers. The most influential members of the politburo were Chin Peng, Yeung Kwo and Lau Lee. At this point the army had about 4000 soldiers, about 10% women. It was divided into ten Regiments, nine of which were predominantly Chinese and one of which was composed mostly of Malays and Indians. The latter was successfully eliminated by the British who wished to confine the insurgency to the Chinese community.O'Ballance, p 100; Short, pp 208, 209. A civilian organisation called the Min Yuen supported the MPLA, collecting supplies and information.O'Ballance, p 92. The MPLA lived in jungle or forest camps similar to‚Äîor even the same as‚Äîto those which the MPAJA had used.P 104. By mid 1950 they, with the help of the Min Yuen, had acquired uniforms. These were of either khaki or jungle green British pattern.\\"O'Ballance, pp 105, 6. The MPAJA and MPLA usually wore three stars on their caps, signifying the three races of Malaya. Road or rail ambushes were favoured by the guerrillas, averaging about 17 per month from September 1949 to February 1950, and 56 per month from then until September 1950, peaking at 100 in the latter month.Short, pp 206, 211, 12(Short, p 211.) To prevent peasants, particularly squatters, from aiding the guerrillas, the British commenced relocation, which became a major component of British strategy under the Briggs' Plan of 1950. By the mid-1950s about 500,000 people (roughly 10% of Malaya's population) had been moved into compounds, termed 'New Villages', which were surrounded by high barbed wire fences and guarded by police. On mines and estates, employees did not face relocation but merely 'regroupment' into guarded compounds on site. About 650,000 people were regrouped in this manner. In addition, in June 1951, a general food-control program called 'Operation Starvation' was instituted. In 'food restricted areas', eating was only permitted at home, not at cafes and restaurants or workplaces. Shop keepers had to keep strict account of all food sold, and canned goods had to be punctured at time of sale to necessitate their being used promptly.O'Ballance, pp 112, 121. Widespread burning of villages suspected of Communist sympathies was also common in the early years.Short, pp 110, 153,4 163‚Äì8. As a military strategy, these restrictive measures were highly successful. By 1953 the MPLA was often short of food and its numbers declined.O'Ballance, p 136, Short, p 350. Coates, Suppressing Insurgency, p 55. Faced with failure to establish any 'Liberated Areas', MCP renewed its work with trade unions and political parties.O'Ballance, pp 112, 113, 140, 141. The MPLA, for its part, began to increasingly rely on Malaya's aboriginal population for support. Internment of Aborigines was abandoned after mass deaths, and the government instead adopted strategy of offering the aborigines' aid and building forts in aborigine territory.Sandhu, pp 166, 7. In July 1955 Malaya's first general elections took place, with Tunku Abdul Rahman becoming Chief Minister.O'Ballance, p 150. One of his first acts was to declare a partial amnesty. The amnesty remained in place until 8 February 1956 but resulted in only 73 surrenders.O'Ballance, p 154. On 24 September 1955 Chin Peng wrote to Rahman offering to negotiate peace. This was accepted and on 17 October two government representatives, Too Joon Hing, an Assistant Minister of Education, and I.S. Wylie, the Deputy Commissioner of the Federation police, met Chin Peng and another member of the MCP Central Executive Committee at Klian Intan.O'Ballance, p 152. Two further meetings followed in November. On 24 December the MCP released a new 'Eight Point Program' which called for an end to the Emergency Regulations, a cessation of hostilities, reform of Malaya's political system, democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production. The negotiations culminated in the Baling meeting on 28 and 29 December 1955. Representing the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Cheng Lock Tan, leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). For the MCP were Chin Peng Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. Chin Peng wanted legal recognition of the MCP and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The Government demanded the dissolution of the MCP, and the talks broke down. In 1956 Chin Peng wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. In April 1957, Hor Lung, a Politburo member in charge of the Southern operations of the MPLA since 1953, was bribed to surrender to the security forces.O'Ballance, p 160. By July 1957, about 30,000 square miles (approximately 78,000 km¬≤) out of Malaya's total area of 50,850 square miles (approximately 130,000 km¬≤) had been declared by the government as 'White Areas' ‚Äì areas where the MPLA had essentially been eliminated and the Emergency Regulations withdrawn.O'Ballance, p 158. In August 1957, Kuala Lumpur and district were declared 'White'. By mid 1958 the MPLA existed mainly in Perak and the Southern part of Johore.O'Ballance, p 161. By early 1959 the MPLA was active only around the Thai border. Meanwhile, on 31 August 1957, Malaya became independent from Britain. Tunku Abdul Rahman became Prime Minister. The Director of Operations against the insurrection, however, remained a British General, namely Lieutenant-General Archibald Cassels. On 31 July 1960 the government formally declared that the 'Emergency' was over. However, Emergency restrictions remained in place in the area near the Thailand border. =Post-1960 period= In the mid 1960s the US State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 2000.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122. The Communist guerrilla force, with a strength of about 500, continued to subsist on either side of the Thailand border. Meanwhile, Chin Peng and other cadre in China had limited contact with the jungle bases. From 1969 they launched a radio station in Hunan called \\"Suara Revolusi Malaya\\" (Voice of the Malayan Revolution), broadcasting to supporters in Malaysia and Singapore. This was shut down in 1981 at the request of Deng Xiaoping.Chin Peng, My Side of History, pp 450, 457‚Äì460. Also in 1969, in response to the intensification of the Vietnam War and the Cultural Revolution in China, the party stepped up armed struggle. In 1970, however, the bases in Thailand were convulsed by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions formed which condemned the purge. Chin Peng subsequently denied involvement and rehabilitated his accused comrades.Chin Peng, My Side of History, pp 466‚Äì469,499. In 1989, the CPM finally laid down its arms. On 2 December, at the town of Had Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Abdullah C. D. met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the CPM and both governments. MCP manifestos From time to time the MCP released policy statements or manifestos to the public. * 1940.

MCP put six proposals to the BMA. At least one of them went beyond 27 August points: a demand for self-government.

Geography Map of Jefferson Park boundaries as delineated by the Los Angeles Times Jefferson Park is a 1.28-square-mile neighborhood. It is bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, South Western Avenue and Arlington Avenue on the east and Jefferson Boulevard and Obama Boulevard on the south.The Thomas Guide, 2006, pages 633 and 673 According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, The neighborhood touches Arlington Heights to the north, Adams- Normandie to the east, the Exposition Park residential neighborhood on the southeast, Leimert Park on the south and West Adams to the west. Jefferson Park contains within it a smaller neighborhood called West Adams Terrace. History With development commencing around the turn of the 20th century, Jefferson Park began as one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. On the hills rising west of Western Avenue, wealthy white Angelenos built luxury Edwardian, Craftsman, and Art Deco mansions, with churches and commercial buildings of commensurate expense. In 1903 there were trolley cars running down Jefferson and Adams Boulevard. Some wealthy blacks moved into the area as well, leading the neighborhood to be dubbed \\"Sugar Hill\\" by many African- Americans of the day. To the south, in the flatter areas along Jefferson Boulevard, a low-rise commercial corridor developed, with small single-story homes and low-rise apartment buildings in the blocks behind. After the 1948 Supreme Court ruling that banned segregationist covenants on property, most of Jefferson Park's white population decamped to other parts of the region, in turn being replaced by upper-middle and upper-class blacks whose descendants still reside in many of the district's spectacular homes. The Jefferson Park and Jefferson Boulevard area saw an influx of Creole peoples to the Los Angeles area in the post-World War II period. The resulting area was dubbed \\"Little New Orleans\\" and saw a large population of Creole people and Creole owned businesses such as the Big Loaf Bakery and Harold and Belle‚Äôs, an upscale creole restaurant. The area and its Creole influence has been mentioned in the 2007 book One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life--A Story of Race and Family Secrets by Bliss Broyard. The area is undergoing gentrification as young professionals are purchasing the craftsman homes that surround the area, and new shops and restaurants are opening up. Population A total of 23,130 people lived in the neighborhood's 1.42 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census‚Äîaveraging 16,300 people per square mile, among the highest population density in the city as a whole. The median age was 31, about the same as the rest of the city.

The school serves a mostly low-income and minority population, and it failed to meet the state's educational standards in English and mathematics. The parents voted to take control of what had been a chronically underperforming school, and they chose to organize it as a hybrid charter school, with the Los Angeles Unified School District operating kindergarten through 5th grade and a private entity, Crown Prep Academy, running grades 5 through 8.

Until being overtaken by Catherine Martin in 2014, he was Australia's most prolific Oscar winner, having won three Academy Awards for Best Costume Design. Biography =Early life= Orry-Kelly was born in Kiama, New South Wales, Australia, and was known as Jack Kelly. His father William Kelly was born on the Isle of Man and was a gentleman tailor in Kiama. Orry was a name of an ancient king of the Isle of Man. Orry-Kelly was sent to Sydney at age 17 to study banking, and there he developed his interest in theatre. =Move to the U.S.= Orry-Kelly journeyed to New York City to pursue an acting career and shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with Charles Phelps (also known as Charlie Spangles) and Cary Grant, with whom, he wrote, he had an on-again, off-again relationship until the 1930s.Orry-Kelly. Women I've Undressed. 2015. Random House Australia. A job painting murals in a nightclub led to his employment by Fox East Coast studios illustrating titles. He designed costumes and sets for Broadway's Shubert Revues and George White's Scandals. He served with the United States Army Air Corps during World War II until being discharged for alcohol problems.\\"Fashion Expert Stationed with Air Forces Here\\", St. Petersburg Times, 20 December 1942 =Hollywood= Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca (1942) Nina Foch in An American in Paris (1951) After moving to Hollywood in 1932, Orry-Kelly was hired by Warner Bros. as their chief costume designer and he remained there until 1944. He was encouraged to hyphenate his name for film credits in order to appear more exotic. Later, his designs were also seen in films at Universal, RKO, 20th Century Fox, and MGM studios. He won three Academy Awards for Best Costume Design (for An American in Paris, Les Girls, and Some Like It Hot) and was nominated for a fourth (for Gypsy). In addition to his film work he was also a portrait artist and was permitted to undertake private commissions for gowns and ready to wear dresses. Orry- Kelly worked on many films now considered classics, including 42nd Street, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, Arsenic and Old Lace, Harvey, Oklahoma!, Auntie Mame, and Some Like It Hot. He designed for all the great actresses of the day, including Bette Davis, Kay Francis, Ruth Chatterton, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Dolores del R√≠o, Ava Gardner, Ann Sheridan, Barbara Stanwyck, and Merle Oberon. Orry-Kelly was known for his ability to \\"design for distraction\\" to compensate for difficult figure shapes. When Orry-Kelly was first assigned to films with Kay Francis they would dissect her parts. She would be dressed in opposition to the role, with the traditional femme fatale or manipulative character in frills and the honest heroine in a tailored, classic suit. Orry-Kelly would apply this aesthetic in the creation of gowns for a number of Bette Davis's characters as well. Orry-Kelly also had the job of creating clothes for the cross-dressing characters played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in Some Like It Hot. His skill is shown by the fact that while Some Like It Hot was in production, Curtis and Lemmon would go into the ladies' room after eating lunch without being spotted as men. He wrote that when he finished draping Dolores del R√≠o in white jersey, \\"she became a Greek goddess ... she was incredibly beautiful\\". The elegant clothes he designed for Bergman's character in Casablanca have been described as \\"pitch perfect\\". In addition to designing, Kelly wrote a column, \\"Hollywood Fashion Parade\\", for the International News Service, owned by William Randolph Hearst, during the years of World War II. Kelly's memoirs, entitled Women I've Undressed were discovered in the care of a relative, as a result of publicity surrounding Gillian Armstrong's 2015 documentary on Kelly, Women He's Undressed.\\"Gillian Armstrong on her Orry-Kelly film: friendship, fame and homophobia\\" by Alexandra Spring, The Guardian, 13 June 2015 The memoir was published for the first time in 2015. =Death= A longtime alcoholic, Orry-Kelly died of liver cancer in Hollywood in 1964 at the age of 66 and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. His pallbearers included Cary Grant, Tony Curtis, Billy Wilder and George Cukor and his eulogy was read by Jack L. Warner. He had no living relatives when he died so his personal effects and Academy Awards were stored by Ann Warner, wife of his friend and former boss, Jack. The Oscars were among the items in an exhibition entitled Orry-Kelly: Dressing Hollywood, at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in August 2015.

Bonney and Quinton united in the 1880s against the encroachment of white settlers on land set aside for Native Americans in Indian Territory. They drew up a petition that addressed the binding obligation of treaties between the United States and Native American nations. The petition was circulated for signature in sixteen states and was presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes at the White House and in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1880. Amelia Stone Quinton (1833-1926) The Association changed its name to National Indian Association, and was voluntarily dissolved in 1951.  History  Concerned about European-American encroachment on lands reserved for tribes in Indian Territory, Mary Bonney and Amelia Stone Quinton gathered signatures for petitions to demonstrate support among American people to honor the treaties made with tribes by the United States. They submitted the first such petition to the President and Congress in 1880. and Initially The Association first began as a petition drive to persuade Congress to uphold Indian treaties. Initially founded in 1879 in reaction to the prospect of opening Oklahoma Indian Territory to white settlement, additional branches quickly expanded in the 1880s. At its peak the Association supported 98 branch organizations in 28 states and sustained 56 missions on Indian reservations. The first crusade was a five-year mission devoted to gaining political rights for Indians to vote as United States citizens. Soon, chapters in sixteen states participated in the movement. In 1882, the male-dominated Indian Rights Association commandeered the lobbying functions of the Association. In response to this, the Association shifted toward a \\"maternalist\\" approach and focused on missionary work. The missionary efforts included tasks such as home building, hospital, and educational work on the reservations. Bonney retired from the presidency of the WNIA in November 1884; she was succeeded by Mary Lowe Dickinson, who was elected to the office. In 1887, Anna Stone Quinton was unanimously elected president in 1887. The Association underwent several name changes, first named the Central Indian Committee (1879), switching to the Indian Treaty-Keeping and Protective Association (1881-1882), then the Women's National Indian Association (1882-1901). That year they took the name of National Indian Association (1901). The Association was voluntarily dissolved in 1951 due to funding cuts and policy shifts.  Goals of the movement  The Association's aims were to gain assimilation of American Indians into mainstream society, including to encourage their becoming Christian. It maintained missions, produced several publications, and influenced national policy, including the passing of the Dawes Act in 1887. Its main objectives were to assimilate Indians through Christian education and missionary work, and abolish the reservation system. Quinton described the Association's foundation as a \\"united effort to move our government to grant a legal status to Indians, the protection of law, lands in severalty, and education.\\" She wrote a pamphlet that criticized the greed of settlers and the unfaithfulness of the United States government toward Indians. Quinton explained the work of the WNIA as \\"the work of informing the public of the needs, capabilities, and progress of our native Indians, and also it is the work of moving the Government, by direct appeals, to render just to help them.\\" The WNIA focused on reservation-based communities located west of the Mississippi River. It also supported missions among the Seminole in Florida and the Chiricahua prisoners of war confined in Alabama. During the next decade, the WNIA battled local, state, and federal officials to secure land for them. The WNIA did not believe that the Indian peoples should govern themselves independently but that they should be included in United States mainstream society. In response to the \\"maternalist\\" approach taken by the WNIA, the women tried to teach Native American women about middle-class, European-American practices and roles. They provided materials and resources to enable the women to conform to these \\"new gendered expectations.\\" Children were taught to read and write in English in mission schools. Mothers were to be taught to make \\"comfortable and attractive homes\\" and \\"cook the foods of civilizations,\\" and both women and children were taught \\"redeeming Christian truths.\\"  Legislative influence  The Association supported passage of the Dawes Act in 1887. This provided for the allotment of communal reservation land to individual households of tribal members, in order to extinguish Indian land rights in Indian Territory. This was required in order for the territory, together with Oklahoma Territory, to be admitted as a state. In addition, giving households individual plots of land to farm was seen as key to producing subsistence farmers. The Act also granted Indians US (and state) citizenship. It would enable them to vote, but also made them subject to state and federal taxes. While many of the Association's members considered the Dawes Act an achievement, they did not realize the adverse effects it would have for many Indians. During the subsequent decades, the Five Civilized Tribes lost 90 million acres of former communal lands, which were sold to non-Natives. Many Indians were unfamiliar with land ownership and were targeted by criminals, losing their already small plots of land. Furthermore, the Dawes Act complicated the social structures of the tribes and contributed to their decline in later years.

It offers an idealistic view of the scientific work ethic, as reflected in the title which suggests that the scientists' weekends are nonexistent. Their idealism is contrasted by an inept administration and a dishonest, show-horse professor. The \\"Scientific Research Institute of Sorcery and Wizardry\\" (or, in Andrew Bromfield's 2002 translation \\"the National Institute for the Technology of Witchcraft and Thaumaturgy\\", abbreviated to \\"NITWITT\\"), located in the fictional Northern Russian town of Solovets, is portrayed as a place where everyone either works diligently, or else their loss of honesty is symbolized by their ears becoming more and more hairy. These hairy-eared people are viewed with disdain by the idealistic scientists. The more morally backward specimens are the most self-aggrandizing and sure of their own significance, while conducting the more ridiculous and nonsensical pseudo-research, to justify their position. Tale of the Troika, which describes Soviet bureaucracy at its worst, is a sequel, featuring many of the same characters.  Characters and events  The novel is written from the point of view of Aleksandr Ivanovich Privalov (usually called Sasha), a young programmer from Leningrad, who picks up two hitchhikers during a road trip north through Karelia. After the two find out that he is a programmer, they convince him to stay in Solovets and work together with them in the Scientific Research Institute of Sorcery and Wizardry (abbreviated NIIChaVo in Russian, which sounds very close to \\"–ù–∏—á–µ–≥–æ\\", the word for \\"nothing\\"). The book contains a large number of references to well-known Russian fairy tales and children's stories: Baba Yaga makes an appearance as does Zmey Gorynych and the Learned Cat from Pushkin's \\"Ruslan and Lyudmila\\", who turns out to be a slightly demented bard. Some figures from mythology also appear, such as genies and Cain. The authors portray these persons and concepts (such as magic) either as objects of scientific inquiry or members of the Institute. Merlin, for example, is described as an incompetent boaster and is in charge of the Institute's Department of Predictions. The Technical Helpdesk is headed by one Sabaoth Baalovich Odin, also described as the most powerful wizard in the universe, while the vivarium is staffed by Alfred, a vampire. The novel is remarkable for its colorful characters. For example, Crist√≥bal Josevich Junta was formerly a Grand Inquisitor, and is now the head of the Department of the Meaning of Life. He is also a talented taxidermist. It is rumored that his collection includes a Standartenf√ºhrer of the SS, an erstwhile friend of Junta's and also a taxidermist. Crist√≥bal Josevich, so goes the rumor, was equally skilled, only faster. Fyodor Simeonovich Kivrin, the head of the Department of Linear Happiness, is a stuttering big guy, an eternal optimist, an apprentice programmer, a fan of Erle Stanley Gardner, and a mentor of sorts to Privalov. Modest Matveevich Kamnoedov (whose surname translates to \\"stone- eater\\") is an archetypal administrator and bureaucrat who does not understand the \\"Monday begins on Saturday\\" work ethic. On New Year's Eve, he directs Privalov to turn off the lights and lock all doors, but Privalov soon finds out that everyone is still at the Institute and research continues. For example, the archetypically rude Viktor Korneev (usually called Vitka) claims to have left his clone to work in his lab, which Privalov recognizes to be Korneev himself, because clones never sing or show any emotion. Much of the action centers on the laboratory of Amvrosiy Ambroisovich Vybegallo (roughly \\"one who runs out\\", a fictional surname based on ancient Polish-Lithuanian names like Jagiello), a professor whose gargantuan experiments are spectacularly wasteful and crowd-pleasing but utterly unscientific. In his quest for an \\"ideal man\\" he creates a model of \\"partially satisfied man\\" (allusion to Soviet dogma that under Communism all people will be perfect and will have all their needs satisfied, and that Soviet socialism is an intermediate state on the path to full Communism) which eats inordinate amounts of raw offal achieving ever shortening periods of lethargic \\"full satisfaction\\", until it begins eating without ever stopping and eventually bursts, literally. On a New Year's Day Vybegallo hatches up his ultimate creation, a \\"model of a completely satisfied man\\" who can instantly satisfy all of his wants. Immediately upon hatching the model attempts to consume the whole universe, but Roman Oyra-Oyra manages to stop him by throwing at him a genie in a bottle, clear allusion to a Molotov cocktail. Vybegallo is modeled in large part on Trofim Lysenko, the charlatan and politico responsible for many setbacks in the science of genetics in USSR. The final part of the book concerns the mystery of Janus Poluektovich Nevstruev, the director of the institute, who is known to be one man in two personas, called A-Janus and U-Janus.  Translations  The first English translation was published by DAW Books in 1977.The DAW translation In August 2005, Seagull Publishing, London, published a translation by Andrew Bromfield titled Monday Starts on Saturday ().The Seagull translation The publisher described it as \\"the Russian equivalent of Harry Potter, written 40 years earlier\\". The book features illustrations by Evgeny Migunov, one of the best illustrators of the works of the Strugatsky brothers. Puns and hints * The Russian language abbreviation for the institute, NIICHAVO, sounds like a colloquial pronunciation for the word \\"nichevo\\" (\\"it doesn't matter\\" or \\"nothing\\"). In the English translation by Andrew Bromfield, the name of the Institute has been translated as NITWITT (National Institute for the Technology of Witchcraft and Thaumaturgy). * The place of \\"Solovets\\" hints at Solovetsky Islands, with their historical and mythological associations. * \\"A-Janus and U-Janus\\" is a hint to Janus Bifrons. In Russian, the word \\"litso\\" means both \\"person\\" and \\"face\\" (hint to Janus). * Vybegallo with his pseudo-commoner appearance and radical pseudoscientific ideas is a hint to Trofim Lysenko.\\"Before and After the 'Tale'...\\" . Plans for adaptation * In 1965, a TV play was staged, based on the book. * Charodei (Sorcerers) TV film (1982) was initially written by Strugatskys as adaptation of the second part of the novel. But director Konstantin Bromberg turned down the script due to its serious tone and social commentary, and the Strugatskys had to rewrite their script as a light-hearted romantic comedy. As a result, the movie bore almost no resemblance to the book besides the similar setting and several characters' names. * In 2015, Teterin Films studio has obtained the rights to adaptation, with plans to release a feature film based on the book. As of 2018, the project was still in development hell. References Sources *Byron Lindsey, \\"On the Strugackij Brothers‚Äô Contemporary Fairytale Monday Begins of Saturday\\".

It depicts the harvest time, in the months of July and August or late summer. Nicolaes Jonghelinck, a merchant banker and art collector from Antwerp, commissioned this painting. Painting The painting is one in a series of six (or perhaps twelve) works, five of which are still extant, that depict different times of the year. As in many of his paintings, the focus is on peasants and their work and does not have the religious themes common in landscape works of the time. Notably, some of the peasants are shown eating while others are harvesting wheat, a (relating to phenomena such as ideas, language, or culture, as they occur or change over a period of time) depiction of both the production and consumption of food. Pears can be seen on the white cloth in front of the upright sitting woman who eats bread and cheese while a figure in the tree to the far right picks pears. The painting shows a large number of activities representative of the 16th-century Belgian rural life. For example, on the far right a person is shaking apples from the tree. In the center left of the painting, a group of villagers can be seen participating in the blood sport of cock throwing. The painting has been at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City since 1919. The Metropolitan Museum of Art calls this painting a ‚Äúwatershed in the history of Western art‚Äù and the ‚Äúfirst modern landscape‚Äù. A sense of distance is conveyed by the workers carrying sheaves of wheat through the clearing, the people bathing in the pond, the children playing and the ships far away.

She is considered to be the most important woman in the Native American movement to protect their tribal lands. She was also involved in the early movement to provide for girls' education. With fellow teacher Harriette A. Dillaye, in 1850 she founded a female seminary in Philadelphia. It became known as the Ogontz School for Young Ladies after it moved to a suburban estate of that name. After a second move, the last campus was developed after 1950 as Penn State Abington. In collaboration with Amelia Stone Quinton, Bonney founded the Women's National Indian Association, which worked initially to defend Native American land rights against settler encroachment. They eventually supported assimilation of Native Americans to the majority culture, including support for the Dawes Act of 1887. This proposed allotment of lands in Indian Territory to individual Indian households, the end of tribal governments, and support for the tribes to take up subsistence farming.Mathes, V.S. 2009. \\"Mary Lucinda Bonney and Amelia Stone Quinton, Founders of the Women's National Indian Association,\\" American Baptist Quarterly. 28, no. 4: 421-440.  Early life & education  Mary Bonney was the fourth child of six in her family, who were devoted Baptists. After her parents started her education at Ladies Academy in Hamilton, New York, she transferred to the Emma Willard School in Troy. Here she found a classical curriculum that was nearly identical to that provided in men's colleges. After two years at Emma Willard School, Bonney graduated in 1835 and began her teaching career. She taught in a variety of cities and states, ranging from Jersey City and other places in New Jersey, New York City, South Carolina, Providence, Rhode Island; and Philadelphia, among others. She first taught in New Jersey. Next she moved to New York City, where she became the principal of academy in De Ruyter, before she took a temporary teaching spot at her alma mater. In 1842 she moved to the South in order to be in charge of a girls' school in Beaufort, South Carolina. After six years, she returned to the North, teaching in Providence, Rhode Island. A year later she moved to Philadelphia to take another teaching position. Ogontz School for Young Ladies In 1850, Bonney wanted to provide her widowed mother a house. She co-founded the Chestnut Street Female Seminary in Philadelphia, with Harriette A. Dillaye, a fellow teacher at Troy Female Seminary (Emma Willard School). As the school prospered, its student body expanded. To accommodate the growth, in 1883 Bonney leased the Ogontz Estate, former home of banker Jay Cooke, in suburban Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, for $15,000 annually. This enabled Cooke to recover from financial setbacks in that period. The school was renamed as Ogontz School for Young Ladies after the estate. The school offered girls, ages 13 through 18, (both boarders and day students) a liberal art education, which included science, humanities, and physical education. As the school became more successful, it needed more space. Ownership changed hands and, in 1916 owner and president, Abby A. Sutherland, purchased a 54-acre plot for the school in Rydal, Pennsylvania, in Abington Township about eight miles from Philadelphia. After operating the school for several more decades, in 1950 she donated this facility to Pennsylvania State University. The campus was developed as Penn State Abington, classified in 1997 as one of several colleges in the commonwealth system.  Activist  In 1878 Congress proposed to take away land reserved under treaties to tribes that had been removed to Indian Territory. Bonney was outraged and started a petition in opposition. She decided to ask for help from her missionary circle. With their help, she started a campaign that collected about 13,000 signatures. The petition was presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes and Congress. They organized signatures for a second petition, with 50,000 signatures and presented it in 1881 to the Senate through Senator Henry L. Dawes (R-Massachusetts), sponsor of the act that bears his name. That same year Bonney and leading followers decided to form an association. They called themselves Indian Treaty-Keeping and Protective Association, and Bonney was elected as president. In 1882 they presented the government with a third petition, numbering nearly 100,000 signatures. These were in support of a proposal to grant tribal lands to Native Americans.  Marriage & death  After Bonney resigned from the presidency in November 1884, she reduced her role in the Association. But she always supported these causes financially. In 1888 she married Reverend Thomas Rambaut, whom she had met 40 years before while teaching in Robertville, South Carolina. In 1888 both took part in the World's Missionary Convention in London and married there. After the couple returned to the US, they settled in Bonney's hometown of Hamilton, New York. Reverend Rambaut died on October 15, 1890. The widowed Bonney moved in with her brother in Hamilton. She died in 1900. References Bibliography *Graves, K.

Created by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck for Fawcett Comics, Mister Mind the character made a cameo appearance in Captain Marvel Adventures #22 (March 1943) before making his full first appearance in Captain Marvel Adventures #26 (August 1943). He is considered one of Captain Marvel's greatest enemies. One of Shazam/Captain Marvel's primary villains and archenemies, Mister Mind is a two-inch alien worm of high intelligence with telepathic powers. Mind usually carries out his villainous plans through an organization called the Monster Society of Evil. The Monster Society of Evil made its debut in Captain Marvel Adventures #22, and the resulting \\"Monster Society of Evil\\" story arc continued for two years in Captain Marvel Adventures, ending with issue #46 (May 1945). Mister Mind appeared as a cameo in the DC Extended Universe film Shazam! portrayed in CGI and voiced by the movie's director David F. Sandberg. Publication history =Fawcett Comics= After a brief appearance in issue #26, Mister Mind is eventually revealed in Captain Marvel Adventures #27 to be a cartoonish alien worm with spectacles and a talkbox around his neck to amplify his voice. Despite his small size, Mister Mind continues to use his powers of intellect and telepathy to battle Captain Marvel in subsequent chapters of the serial, eventually recruiting numerous other allies from Alligator-Men to Adolf Hitler and all of the Axis Powers. \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" serial concluded with Captain Marvel Adventures #46 (1945), in which Mind is finally captured, tried, and executed. =DC Comics= Fawcett ceased publication of Captain Marvel comics after settling a lawsuit from DC Comics in 1953. Twenty years later, DC acquired the rights to publish its own Captain Marvel stories under the title Shazam!, as well as the reprint rights to the Fawcett material. Mister Mind was reintroduced in a new story in Shazam! #2 (1973), which explained that he had survived his execution and hid while Captain Marvel and his allies were stuck in suspended animation for 20 years. Mister Mind would appear regularly as part of Captain Marvel's rogues gallery in his adventures in Shazam and World's Finest Comics through the 1970s and early 1980s. Mind also appeared, often with some form of the Monster Society of Evil, as a guest villain in other DC publications such as Justice League of America and DC Comics Presents. The final appearance of Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil in the original DC/Fawcett continuity was in All-Star Squadron #51‚Äì54 (November 1985 to February 1986), an arc written by Roy & Dann Thomas that was chronologically Mind's first appearance and revealed the origin of his hatred of humans and superheroes. DC reset its comics' continuity with the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985‚Äì86, and Mister Mind disappeared from DC publications for a decade. He re-emerged in The Power of Shazam! #13 (March 1996), now a more realistically depicted caterpillar-like being from the planet Venus possessing powers which include mind control, telepathy, and mental image projection. This Mind was the main villain of The Power of Shazam!'s second major story arc, and was depicted as the lead scout of a race of Venusian worms looking to conquer the Earth. Even though Captain Marvel eventually destroys the other worms, Mind survives and becomes a recurring villain in The Power of Shazam!, JSA, and other DC publications, often forming a Monster Society of Evil to do his bidding as in the original serial. The weekly maxiseries 52 (2006-2007) featured Mister Mind as the series' final major adversary. In this story, Mind gains the ability to evolve into a gigantic \\"Hyperfly\\", able to eat space and time and inadvertently creating a new DC Multiverse in the process. Following 52, Mind appeared irregularly as a supervillain in DC comic series such as Action Comics, Booster Gold, and more. In 2007, cartoonist Jeff Smith, the creator of Bone, wrote and illustrated a four-issue miniseries, Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil, which offered an updated take on the classic Fawcett story. In 2011, DC again reset its continuity with The New 52. In subsequent stories, Mister Mind has appeared sparingly, mostly in cameo appearances as in Justice League #21 (2013) and Convergence: Shazam! #2 (2015). He currently appears as one of the villains in DC's current Shazam! ongoing comic series, with his first appearance in Shazam! #2 (March 2019). Fictional character biography (chronological) =Pre-Crisis= Earth-Two Mister Mind came to Earth during World War II, drawn by its radio broadcasts; he especially loved Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy. Upon learning that his beloved Charlie was not real, he decided to conquer the world instead. To this end, he formed the first Monster Society of Evil, which was merely a shadow of what was to come. He gathered known villains like Dummy, Mister Who, Nyola, Oom the Mighty, and Ramulus to make up the Monster Society of Evil. They succeeded in capturing Hawkgirl. Not long after its founding, the other villains tried to kill him and Mister Mind retreated to Earth-S. Without his leadership, the team was quickly defeated in battle by the All-Star Squadron.All-Star Squadron #51-54. DC Comics. Captain Marvel Adventures: \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" (Earth-S) As a side-effect of the reality-altering Crisis on Infinite Earths, Mister Mind arrived in the universe of Earth-S (where Fawcett's former characters dwelled) sometime around 1846 (it was mentioned in this story that he had been working on a weapon for 97 years). His brilliant intellect, telepathic powers, and ruthlessness allowed him to conquer much of space, establishing bases on many different worlds as well as varied locations on Earth. He recruited supervillains, armies, and entire alien species to aid him in his attempt to conquer the Earth, and first relayed his information from the planetoid Punkus via radio. He began his reign of terror on Earth in 1943, boasting that he and the Monster Society of Evil would give Captain Marvel \\"nightmares from now on\\". This formed the basis of the plot for \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" serial in Captain Marvel Adventures #22‚Äì46 (March 1943 to May 1945). Mind was not revealed as a worm until Captain Marvel Adventures #26. Mind had many and varied plans to conquer Earth, and to destroy Captain Marvel and/or his teenaged alter-ego, Billy Batson. But Captain Marvel stopped all of Mind's plans, dismantled all of his resources, and arrested, frightened away, or accidentally killed all of his henchmen. Reverse cliffhangers were used in the Monster Society stories, such as Mister Mind about to be crushed under a careless heel or about to be crushed in a paper roller. Finally, a desperate Mister Mind attacked Captain Marvel's alter ego Billy Batson with ether and left him unconscious. But he then realized that without his henchmen, he was practically helpless and unable to kill him. Captain Marvel soon captured the world's wickedest worm and had him tried and executed for killing 186,744 people. Shazam!: Return of the Society Shazam! #2 was Mister Mind's first appearance in a DC comic, and depicted his return to villainy. Although he had been sentenced to death in the electric chair, Mister Mind's alien physiology proved resistant to the high voltage, and he entered a state of suspended animation that was mistaken for death. On the verge of being stuffed for display in a museum, he awakened, hypnotized the taxidermist into creating a duplicate, and escaped. Shortly after Captain Marvel's own return from suspended animation, he countered Mister Mind trying to destroy the country with an expanding balloon-like weapon in St. Louis. With intelligence from a reformed Herkimer, Marvel succeeds in thwarting Mind's plan and capturing the worm.Shazam #2 (1973). DC Comics. Several future issues of Shazam! depict Mister Mind attempting to recruit new henchmen and reform the Monster Society of Evil, at one point even recruiting a displaced Lex Luthor from Earth- One.Shazam #15 (1974). DC Comics. The Monster Society of Evil was briefly reformed in Shazam! #14 (September‚ÄìOctober 1974). An escaped Mister Mind, hungry for revenge, assembled a new, smaller group which included Doctor Sivana, his evil children Georgia and Sivana Jr, and Ibac. They attempted to attack the Marvel Family - Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr. - with a death ray that created \\"dream\\" monsters using first evil thoughts and later the nightmares of Uncle Marvel. The Marvels end up defeating the Monster Society by convincing Uncle Marvel to dream up \\"dream\\" versions of the Marvels to fight the monsters. World's Finest Comics: The Monster Society Strikes Back Mister Mind reformed his Monster Society of Evil one last time in the classic continuity, in World's Finest Comics #264‚Äì267 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1980 to February‚ÄìMarch 1981). Almost the entire Marvel Family had to unite in order to stop them‚ÄîCaptain Marvel, Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and the three Lieutenant Marvels: Tall Marvel, Fat Marvel, and Hill Marvel. Their wicked plans were wide-ranging, beginning with an assault on Egypt, expanding to a scheme to reverse the entire Earth's topography, Oggar raising an evil army from the sands and dusts of Egypt for Black Adam to lead, and conquering hundreds of planets and using them to build an army of spaceships. Their plans culminated in a massive assault on the Rock of Eternity, home of the Marvels' benefactor, the wizard Shazam. World's Funnest In the Elseworlds story Superman & Batman: World's Funnest (November 2000), the two near-omnipotent imps Mister Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite engage in a tremendous duel that destroys many planes of reality. One of these appears to be a version of Earth-S. During their time there, they run into a version of the Monster Society of Evil that is slightly different from any other, featuring many of Captain Marvel's enemies. Mxyzptlk easily destroys them (with a tentacled beast labeled Mr. Mxyzptlk's Anti-Social Monster) when they begin to annoy him, along with the rest of the universe; however, by the end of the book, all is returned to what it was. =Post-Crisis= Shazam! A New Beginning Mister Mind's return to the DC Universe in wake of Crisis was first hinted at in Roy Thomas' Shazam! A New Beginning. It closed with a defeated Dr. Sivana hiding out and drinking tequila in a Mexican dive bar. He ponders how he will defeat Captain Marvel when he sees a worm in the bottle and has the idea of using it as a weapon against the hero. Thomas' idea of Mister Mind being a mutated tequila worm was not followed up on and he was given a different origin in his next appearance. The Power of Shazam! Mister Mind was fully re-introduced into the DC Universe in Jerry Ordway's The Power of Shazam! series in 1996. Mind was one of a race of millions of mind-controlling worms from the planet Venus, who had plans to invade and take over the Earth, which they claim to have once ruled around the Ice Age. Appointed as the go- ahead agent, Mind arrived on Earth during World War II, by means of an indestructible green Venusian space suit, but was captured by Bulletman, Starman, and Green Lantern Abin Sur before enacting his plan. Mind eventually escaped, stowing away on the Magellan space probe, and decades later forced Doctor Sivana to join forces with him, needing Sivana's scientific prowess to facilitate the Venusian worms' plans. He took control of the wealthy Sinclair Batson in order to finance those plans. The worms' plans to invade the Earth were thwarted by Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, who succeeded in killing all of the worms by sending them into deep space where they froze, save for Mister Mind, whom they placed in the custody of Sergeant Steel and the Department of Metahuman Affairs. Mind eventually escapes, takes over Steel's mind, and programs the robot Mister Atom, another Marvel Family villain in Steel's custody, to destroy the town of Fairfield, where Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) and Mary Bromfield (Mary Marvel) lived with their adopted parents. After Mister Atom's nuclear blast destroys the city and kills nearly all of its residents, the Marvels arrive in Washington, DC seeking revenge. Mister Mind's plot to set off a nuclear holocaust included using clones of himself to take over the minds of several regular American citizens, who were to make their ways to nuclear bomb facilities and initiate a nuclear holocaust. However, Mind's plan was foiled by the Marvel Family and Green Lanterns Kyle Rayner and Hal Jordan. 52 Mister Mind played an integral role in DC's year-long 2006-2007 weekly comic, 52, although the importance of his role in the series was revealed gradually over time and involved the concepts of time travel and temporal paradoxes. The day following the end of the Infinite Crisis event, Dr. Sivana discovers Mister Mind lying in a crater in the desert and pockets him, sealing him in a specimen jar and taking it back to his laboratory to prevent him from interfering with his plans to take over the world.52 #52: Week 1, Day 1. Each of these footnotes represents a timestamps from the 52 comic book, depicting when events happened during the 52-week timeline of the series. As the story involves time travel, several of the events were presented in the comic out of sequence. Sivana bombards Mind with particles of Suspendium, a time-altering element introduced in the 1970s Shazam! title. Although Sivana is then kidnapped by Intergang and forced to join their Science Squad, the Suspendium induces Mister Mind's delayed metamorphosis. As Sivana is dragged off, Mind observes a televised memorial for the heroes lost in the Infinite Crisis, and takes particular note of Skeets, the robotic companion of the time-traveling superhero Booster Gold.52 #01: Week 1, Day 6 With his metamorphosis beginning, Mind proceeds to weave a cocoon around himself, which doubles as a matter transporter that he uses to beam himself inside Skeets in Dr. Magnus' lab,This is seen in 52 #52: Week 2, Day 1; whilst we the readers first see the cocoon in 52 #03: Week 3, Day 6, and Magnus shows it empty to Dr. Morrow in 52 #10: Week 10, Day 6.

Destroying Skeets from within, Mind adopts his identity and makes plans to consume the Multiverse, which had returned to existence as a result of Infinite Crisis. Discovering that Rip Hunter is aware of his plans, Mind, as Skeets, attempts to hunt him down and draw him out, to no avail. Eventually, he discovers Hunter hiding in the bottle city of Kandor, but when Hunter turns the Phantom Zone projector on him, Mind overpowers it and \\"eats\\" the Phantom Zone itself. At the end of the year, Mind tracks Hunter and Booster down to the lab of T. O.

Also during the series, unrelated to Mind's activities, a new incarnation of the Monster Society was formed, consisting of the Four Horsemen of Apokolips, creatures engineered by Intergang's Science Squad (including Sivana). Of particular note is Sobek, a humanoid crocodile not unlike the beings who were members of the Pre-Crisis Monster Society. This Monster Society attacked the Black Marvel Family for not joining the Freedom of Power treaty, and killed Isis and Osiris, only to be destroyed by Black Adam, save for Death, who flees. In his hunt for Death, Black Adam destroys the nation of Bialya, before defeating the final Horseman, torturing it for information, and killing it.52 #52: Week 43-47. DC Comics. =Shazam!

Shazam confronts Mister Mind inside C.C.'s head and engages him in a magic battle. To prevent Mister Mind from casting spells, Shazam punches his talkbox enough to emit energy that knocks out the Monster Society of Evil. After using the Corpus Magnum spell to grow, Shazam works to undo Mister Mind's spell only for Superboy-Prime to interfere. He was able to undo the spell after he and Black Adam defeated Superboy-Prime.Shazam (vol. 3) #11 (September 2020). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Mister Mind is one of Earth's most formidable telepaths. He is able to take control of an individual's mind. He also possessed many insect-related abilities, like the ability to spin very strong silk at speeds faster than the eye can see, so quickly he can encase a human in a cocoon within seconds. Apparently very long-lived, Mister Mind's current body is only the larval stage of his breed: during the 52 miniseries he briefly reaches maturity, becoming a Hyperfly with increased time- and space-bending abilities, feeding over the timelines of singular universes. By this ability, he is able to transform the 52, exactly identical, universes of the current DCU Multiverse into vastly different worlds, literally eating away portions of their history. After being forcibly rejuvenated in his larval stage, Mister Mind apparently retains the ability to reproduce asexually, using a host to breed his identical siblings. Other versions * In Mark Waid and Alex Ross's 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come, Dr. Sivana was credited by Lex Luthor for creating a breed of mind-controlling worms before his death. Also in Superman's gulag, many of the prisoners were members of the Pre-Crisis Monster Societies, such as Jeepers, Mister Banjo, King Kull, the Crocodile Men, Ibac, and Goat-Man. * In Jim Krueger, Doug Braithwaite and Alex Ross's series Justice, Dr. Sivana uses mind-controlling robots based on Mister Mind.Justice #9 In other media =Television= * Mister Mind appeared in The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam! animated series voiced by Lou Scheimer. In one episode, he is strangely stricken with an inferiority complex as bigger villains never take him seriously, despite his historical ability to organize and direct villains far more powerful than himself. * Mister Mind debuts in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Malicious Mister Mind!\\" voiced by Greg Ellis. He ends up usurping leadership of the Monster Society of Evil from Doctor Sivana who formed the group from Mister Atom, Kru'll the Eternal, Ibac, Jeepers, Oom the Mighty, and an unnamed Crocodile-Man (presumably Herkimer). When it came to fighting Batman and the Marvel Family, Mister Mind goes inside the minds of the Marvel Family members, making them turn against each other. When Doctor Sivana tries to eliminate Mister Mind with the death ray he was constructing, it ends up turning Mister Mind into a giant insectoid creature (similar to his Hyperfly form) as he reveals that he reprogrammed the ray to become a growth ray while telling Sivana he was improving the death ray. The infant Batman manages to fire the growth ray on Mister Mind, reducing him back to normal size. The Growth Ray is then used to restore Batman to his rightful age. * Mister Mind appears in the DC Nation short SHAZAM!: Stamina. He challenges Captain Marvel to a staring contest with his challenger Evil Eye. * Mister Mind appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Oliver Vaquer. He is depicted as wearing a radio around his neck that he uses to talk. In \\"Follow That Space Cab!\\", Mister Mind is on the run from a debt to a space crime lord named Boss Kack. Superman already had him in custody while avoiding Lobo and receives help in getting away by the Space Cabbie. During a fight between Lobo, Hawkman, and Superman, Mister Mind gets out of his containment and is lured out of the engine by the Space Cabbie wanting a picture of him. After exiting the Space Cabbie's space cab, Mister Mind ends up near where Superman and Hawkman were fighting Lobo. Lobo accidentally steps on Mind, squashing him. Reasoning that there is enough of his body to collect the bounty from Boss Kack, Lobo wipes his remains off his boot and cheerfully takes his leave without realizing that Mind had the ability to regenerate. Mister Mind's remains are taken into captivity and Mister Mind regenerates inside a prison cell within the Justice League Watchtower. In \\"The Brain Buster\\" Mister Mind, disguised via a hologram, uses a robot to kidnap Batman, Mr. Terrific, Lex Luthor, Calculator, and Brain, and forces them to participate in a series of challenges to determine which one is the smartest. He traps anyone who loses a challenge in a prison cube. When Luthor is the last one standing, Mister Mind reveals himself and his plan: to place his mind in their body, and add their genius intellect to his own I.Q. Mr. Terrific breaks Batman out of the prison cube, and Batman stops Mister Mind's plan. * Mister Mind appears in the episode \\"Little Elvis\\" of Teen Titans Go!, voiced by Scott Menville. In this iteration, Mister Mind is portrayed as more childlike and goofy compared to his previous media appearances, in tune with the series' tone. After the Teen Titans fail to take Shazam and his feud with Mister Mind seriously, he escapes and conjures up the Seven Deadly Sins in a vacuum cleaner and plots to unleash their powers on the world. He is defeated when Shazam destroys the Seven Deadly Sins and throws him into outer space. After this, he is struck by a meteor. =Film= * Mister Mind appears in Shazam! voiced by director David F. Sandberg who was not credited for the role. He is first seen as a captive of the Wizard Shazam at the Rock of Eternity at the time when a younger Doctor Sivana is brought to the sanctuary. He is able to escape his imprisonment after Doctor Sivana's attack on the Wizard. In the mid-credits scene, Mister Mind approaches Doctor Sivana in his prison cell stating to him that there are other ways to gain magic. Mister Mind proposes a future alliance with him while stating that the Seven Realms will be theirs to take over. * Mister Mind appears as the secondary antagonist in the film Lego DC: Shazam!: Magic and Monsters, voiced again by Greg Ellis. He has the Monster Society of Evil consisting of Doctor Sivana, Dummy, Jeepers, Oom the Mighty, and Herkimer the Crocodile-Man gather food for him so he can undergo metamorphosis into a giant moth. When the Justice League consisting of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash (Barry Allen), and Green Lantern (Jessica Cruz) show up to stop him, he uses Sivana's formula to change the League into kids, and then he brainwashes them, except Batman, into his servants. After he eats enough, he transforms and chases the League with Shazam to the Rock of Eternity where he releases Black Adam who drains his power and flings him into space. During the mid-credits scene, Lobo catches him and takes him to collect a $1,000,000,000,000 bounty for him.

Dalton (born May 7, 1847) was superintendent of the St. Louis City Hospital from 1886 to 1892, and later a professor of abdominal and clinical surgery at Marion Sims College of Medicine (now part of the St. Louis University School of Medicine) . He is noted for being the first American to perform the suturing of the pericardium on record. Spanish surgeon Francisco Romero was documented with performing two successful surgeries in 1801 and French surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey was documented as successfully performing surgery on a woman's pericardium in 1810. Suturing of the pericardium The operation occurred on September 6, 1891 at the City Hospital, on a twenty-two- year-old man who had been stabbed in the chest. Upon arrival of the patient, Dalton cleaned the wound and applied a dressing of antiseptic gauze. After several hours, the patient's condition worsened: the left side of his chest became dull to percussion; his temperature and pulse rate rose; his breathing became shallow; and he complained of considerable pain. He was taken to the surgical amphitheatre, where Dalton made an incision over the fourth rib and removed about of it. After tying the severed intercostal artery to control bleeding and removing the blood from the pleural cavity, Dalton observed a transverse wound of the pericardium about in length. With a sharply curved needle and catgut, he closed the wound by continuous suture, overcoming great difficulty caused by the heart pulsations. The pleural cavity was then irrigated and the chest incision closed without drainage. The patient made \\"an uninterrupted, rapid recovery.\\" The published report of the operation appeared in the state medical association's journal and another local periodical in 1894, and in the Annals of Surgery the following year. Legacy On July 10, 1893 African American surgeon Daniel Hale Williams became the first on record to mimic Dalton's success, repairing the torn pericardium of knife wound patient James Cornish. In the mid-1890s, attempts were made to further improve cardiac surgery. The first successful surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.Absolon KB, Naficy MA (2002).

History of Cardiac Surgery, 1896‚Äì1955. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. p. 5. Despite these new accomplishments, Dalton and other early cardiac surgeon received little recognition for the successful surgeries they performed and surgeons still thought they should not perform surgery on the heart.The Impossible: Heart and Brain Surgery Accessed November 29, 2013 Heart surgery would not be widely accepted among surgeons until World War II broke out and forced battlefield surgeons to improve their methods of surgery in order to repair severe war wounds. Despite the earlier lack of recognition for his accomplishments, Dalton later received good recognition for his role in revolutionizing cardiac surgery.  References  * Henry C. Dalton.

The incident sparked a controversy over the use of deadly force by the Portland Police Bureau in Portland, Oregon. James was a passenger - who also had an outstanding warrant for her arrest - stopped by Portland police officers Rick Bean, Kenneth Reynolds, and Scott McCollister. The driver, Terry Jackson, was arrested and placed in a squad car after he was discovered to have an outstanding warrant.Nick Budnick. \\"Anatomy of a Police Shooting.\\" Willamette Week. 2003-10-04.

McCollister then made several unsuccessful attempts to remove James while partially within the vehicle through an open door. He claimed to have tried to pull James out by her hair, and also attempted to use a Taser. He said that he had also attempted to use pepper spray to subdue James, but was unable to operate the canister; an investigation by the Portland Police Bureau found McCollister's pepper spray canister was operational, but no traces of spray were found.\\"Questions Regarding the Shooting of Kendra James.\\" Portland Police Bureau. Retrieved 2014-02-01. McCollister drew his firearm and held it to James' head, demanding she exit the vehicle. McCollister said he then felt the car move and, concerned that he could have fallen out and been run over, fired a single shot. The James family's lawyers questioned whether evidence existed regarding James attempting to move the car, and whether the tactics McCollister used, especially his attempt to enter the car (McCollister said that he was 80% in the car), were consistent with police training. Several witnesses alleged that McCollister did not fire while within the car; powder residue testing indicated that McCollister's handgun was at least 30 to 48 inches away from James when discharged, a fact which lawyers for James' family alleged was inconsistent with McCollister's version of events.

In the early 20th century, he was \\"one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory and American Indian affairs.\\" Eastman was of Santee Dakota, English and French ancestry. After working as a physician on reservations in South Dakota, he became increasingly active in politics and issues on Native American rights, he worked to improve the lives of youths, and founded thirty- two Native American chapters of YMCA. He also helped found the Boy Scouts of America. He is considered the first Native American author to write American history from the Native American point of view. Early life and education Eastman was named Hakadah at his birth in Minnesota; his name meant \\"pitiful last\\" in Dakota. Eastman was so named because his mother died following his birth. He was the last of five children of Wakantakawin, a mixed-race woman also known as Winona (meaning \\"First-Born Daughter\\" in the Dakota language) or Mary Nancy Eastman. She and Eastman's father, a Santee Dakota named Wak-anhdi Ota (Many Lightnings), lived on a Santee Dakota reservation near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. Winona was the only child of Seth Eastman, a U.S. Army officer and illustrator, and Wakh√°≈ã In√°≈æi≈ã Wi≈ã (Stands Sacred), who married at Fort Snelling in 1830.A. LaVonne Brown Ruoff, \\"Eastman's Maternal Ancestry\\", Studies in American Indian Literature, Series 2, Vol. 17, No.2, Summer 2005, accessed 4 April 2011. This post later developed as Minneapolis. Stands Sacred was the fifteen-year-old daughter of Cloud Man, a Santee Dakota chief of French and Mdewakanton descent. Seth Eastman was reassigned from Fort Snelling in 1832, soon after the birth of Winona. Winona was later called Wakantakawin. In the Dakota tradition of naming to mark life passages, Hakadah was later named Oh√≠ye S'a (Dakota: \\"always wins\\"). He had three older brothers (John, David, and James) and an older sister Mary. During the Dakota War of 1862, Oh√≠ye S'a was separated from his father Wak-anhdi Ota and siblings, and they were thought to have died. His maternal grandmother Stands Sacred (Wakh√°≈ã In√°≈æi≈ã Wi≈ã) and her family took the boy with them as they fled from the warfare into North Dakota and Manitoba, Canada. Fifteen years later Oh√≠yesa was reunited with his father and oldest brother John in South Dakota. The father had converted to Christianity, after which he took the name of Jacob Eastman. John also converted and took the surname Eastman. The Eastman family established a homestead in Dakota Territory. When Ohiyesa accepted Christianity, he took the name Charles Alexander Eastman. His father strongly supported his sons getting an education in European-American style schools. Eastman and his older brother John attended mission then a preparatory school, Kimball Union Academy from 1882-1883, and college. Eastman first attended Beloit College and Knox colleges; he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1887. He went on to medical school at Boston University, where he graduated in 1889 and was among the first Native Americans to be certified as a European-style doctor. His older brother became a minister. Rev. John (Ma»üpiyawaku Kida) Eastman was a Presbyterian missionary at the Santee Dakota settlement of Flandreau, South Dakota. Career Dr. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) Charles Eastman worked as an agency physician for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Indian Health Service on the Pine Ridge Reservation and later at the Crow Creek Reservation, both in South Dakota. He cared for Indians after the Wounded Knee massacre. He later established a private medical practice after being forced out of his position, but was not able to make it succeed. As they were struggling financially, his European-American wife, Elaine Goodale Eastman, encouraged him to write some of the stories of his childhood. At her suggestion (and with her editing help), he published the first two in 1893 and 1894 in St. Nicholas Magazine. It had earlier published poetry of hers. These stories were collected in his first book. Between 1894 and 1898, Eastman established 32 Indian groups of YMCA, and established leadership programs and outdoor youth camps. In 1899, he helped recruit students for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, which had been established as the first Indian boarding school run by the federal government. In 1902, Eastman published a memoir, Indian Boyhood, recounting his first fifteen years of life among the Dakota Sioux during the later years of the nineteenth century. In the following two decades, he wrote ten more books, most concerned with his Native American culture. In the early 20th century, he was \\"one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory and American Indian affairs.\\" According Ruth Ann Alexander, Elaine is not given enough credit although she worked intensively on Charles's stories as way to share his life and use her literary talent as both his typist and editor. Carol Lea Clark claims that the books should be seen as a collaboration: \\"Together they produced works of a public popularity that neither could produce separately.\\"Carol Lea Clark, \\"Charles A. Eastman (Ohiseya) and Elaine Goodale Eastman: A Cross-Cultural Collaboration\\", Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, 1994, , accessed 3 February 2011 These views, however, are contested by other Eastman scholars because of their bias toward a European American influence in his publications. Some of these assumptions are based the fact that Eastman stopped publishing in the years following the couple‚Äôs separation. While it is plausible that Elaine may have helped Eastman edit his work, Ruth J. Heflin argues that Elaine's later claims that she actually wrote his works ring false, as she did not come forward with until after Eastman's death.Heflin, pp. 53‚Äì58 However, it can be more safely assumed that Elaine was her husband's typist; Eastman apparently did not learn to type, and was reported to have lost his government position because he could not type his reports. Some of Eastman's books were translated into French, German, Czech and other European languages, and sold well enough to undergo regular reprints. More recently, a selection of his writings was published as The Essential Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa) (2007). Inspired by his writings, Ernest Thompson Seton sought Eastman's counsel in forming the Woodcraft Indians, which became a popular group for boys. New York YMCA asked both Seton and Eastman to help them design YMCA Indian Scouts for urban boys, using rooftop gardens and city parks for their activities. In 1910, Seton invited Eastman to work with him and Daniel Carter Beard, of the Sons of Daniel Boone, to found the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Luther Gulick also consulted with Eastman to assist him and his wife Charlotte to develop the Camp Fire Girls. With his fame as an author and lecturer, Eastman promoted the fledgling Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls. He advised them on how to organize their summer camps, and directly managed one of the first Boy Scout camps along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. His daughter, Irene, worked as a counselor at a Camp Fire Girl camp in Pittsburgh. In 1915, the Eastman family organized their own summer camp at Granite Lake, New Hampshire, where the whole family worked for years. Charles served as a BSA national councilman for many years. =National spokesman= In 1911, Eastman was chosen to represent the American Indian at the Universal Races Congress in London. Throughout his speeches and teachings, he emphasized the importance of seeking peace and living in harmony with nature. He was active in national politics, particularly in matters dealing with Indian rights. He served as a lobbyist for the Dakota between 1894 and 1897. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt assigned Eastman the job of help Sioux (Dakota, Nakota, Lakota) tribal members to choose English legal names to prevent individuals and families from losing allotted lands due to confusion over cultural naming conventions and spellings. Eastman was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians (SAI), which pushed for freedom and self-determination for the American Indian. From 1923 to 1925, Eastman served as an appointed US Indian inspector under President Calvin Coolidge. The Calvin Coolidge administration (1923-1929) invited Eastman to the Committee of 100, a reform panel examining federal institutions and activities dealing with Indian nations. The committee recommended that the government conduct an in-depth investigation into reservation life (health, education, economics, justice, civil rights, etc.). This was commissioned through the Department of Interior and conducted by the Brookings Institution, resulting in the groundbreaking 1928 Meriam Report. The findings and recommendations served as the basis of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration's New Deal for the Indian, including the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, which encouraged tribes to establish self- government according to constitutional models. In 1925, the Bureau of Indian Affairs asked Eastman to investigate the death and burial location of Sacagawea, the young woman who guided and interpreted for the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. He determined that she died of old age at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming on April 9, 1884. More recently discovered contemporary records, however, have led modern historians to believe that Sacagewea actually died in 1812 as a result of an illness following childbirth at Fort Lisa (North Dakota).Drumm, Stella M., ed. (1920). Journal of a Fur- trading Expedition on the Upper Missouri: John Luttig, 1812‚Äì1813, St. Louis: Missouri Historical Society. Personal life In 1891, Eastman married the poet and Indian welfare activist Elaine Goodale, who was serving as Superintendent of Indian Education for the Two Dakotas. She had first taught at Hampton Institute, which then had about 100 Native American students, in addition to African Americans, and at an Indian day school in South Dakota. She supported expanding day schools on reservations for education, rather than sending Native American children away from their families to boarding schools. The Eastmans had six children together: five daughters and a son. The marriage prospered at first, and Elaine was always interested in Indian issues. Eastman's many jobs, failure to provide financially for the family, and absences on the lecture circuit, put increasing strain on the couple.Ruth Ann Alexander, \\"Elaine Goodale Eastman and the Failure of the Feminist Protestant Ethic\\", Great Plains Quarterly, Spring 1988, accessed 3 February 2011 In 1903, at Elaine's request, they returned to Massachusetts, where the family was based in Amherst. Charles was traveling extensively, and Elaine took over managing his public appearances. He lectured about twenty-five times a year across the country. These were productive years for their literary collaboration; he published eight books and she published three. She and Charles separated around 1921, following the death of their daughter Irene in 1918 from influenza during the 1918 flu pandemic. They never divorced or publicly acknowledged the separation. Theodore Sargent, a recent biographer of Goodale, noted that Eastman gained acclaim for the nine books he published on Sioux life, whereas Elaine Goodale Eastman's seven books received little notice.Ruth Ann Alexander, \\"Review: Theodore D. Sargent, Theodore D., The Life of Elaine Goodale Eastman\\", in Great Plains Quarterly, 26:3 (Summer 2006), accessed 3 February 2011 Others have suggested their differing views on assimilation led to strain. Alexander said the catalyst was a rumor that Eastman had an affair with Henrietta Martindale, a visitor at their camp in 1921 and got her pregnant, after which he and Goodale separated. Although the rumor was said to have been untrue, the couple did not reconcile. Later life Charles Eastman built a cabin on the eastern shore of Lake Huron, where he spent his later-year summers. He wintered in Detroit, Michigan with his only son Charles, Jr., also called Ohiyesa. On January 8, 1939 the senior Eastman died from a heart attack in Detroit at age eighty. His interment was at Evergreen Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9798329/charles_alexander_hakada- _pitiful_last_ohiyesa-eastman Elaine Goodale Eastman was close to two daughters and families who lived in Massachusetts. Another lived in New Hampshire. Goodale Eastman died in 1953 and was buried in Northampton. Legacy and honors * As a child, Ohiyesa had learned about herbal medicine from his grandmother.

Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families. Coburg is also known as the location of Veste Coburg, one of Germany's largest castles. In 1530, Martin Luther lived there for six months during which he worked on translating the Bible into German. Today, Coburg's population is close to 41,500. Since it was little damaged in World War II, Coburg retains many historic buildings, making it a popular tourist destination. Geography =Location= Coburg lies about south of Erfurt and about north of Nuremberg on the river Itz. It is an urban district and is surrounded by the Landkreis Coburg. Coburg lies at the foot of the Thuringian Highland. Coburg, Bavaria was part of West Germany until reunification in 1990, but on three sides it borders Thuringia which was East Germany. The border between Bavaria and Thuringia was also the inner German border. =Subdivisions= Coburg pattern English (London) silver spoons, c. 1830 Coburg is divided into 15 Stadtteile: * Coburg (town proper) *Beiersdorf *Bertelsdorf *Cortendorf *Creidlitz *Glend *Ketschendorf *L√∂belstein *L√ºtzelbuch *Neu- and Neershof * *R√∂gen *Scheuerfeld *Seidmansdorf *W√ºstenahorn History Veste Coburg Ehrenburg Palace, rebuilt after a catastrophic fire in 1690, received its Gothic revival exterior in the 19th century Coburg was first mentioned in a monastic document dated 1056, which marked the transfer of ownership to the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, although there was a settlement at the site that predates it called Trufalistat. The origin of the name Coburg is unclear; the first element may be kuh, which would give a literal meaning of \\"cow borough\\". \\"Coburg\\" initially referred to a property centred on the hill where Veste Coburg was later built. Its oldest remains date to the 12th or 13th century. In 1248, the castle came into possession of the House of Henneberg and in 1353 it passed to the House of Wettin with the marriage of Frederick III with Catherine of Henneberg and was initially regarded by them as a Saxon outpost within Franconia. During the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 reformer Martin Luther spent six months at the castle (located at the southernmost point of the Saxon duchy) while his liege lord, John, Elector of Saxony, attended the Diet. Luther was forbidden to attend by the Elector, who feared that he would be imprisoned and burned as a heretic. While quartered at the castle Luther continued with his translation of the Bible into German. In 1547, the princely residence was moved from the Veste to a former monastery, rebuilt as a Renaissance palace, the Ehrenburg. In 1596, Coburg was raised to the status of capital of one of the dynasty's splintered Saxon-Thuringian territories, the newly created Duchy of Saxe-Coburg under the leadership of Duke John Casimir (ruled 1596‚Äì1633). From 1699 to 1826, it was one of the two capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and from 1826‚Äì1918 it was a capital of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Ernest Frederick, the fourth Duke of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld, moved his capital from Saalfeld to Coburg in 1764. Coburg then became capital of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and later of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In the early 19th century, the town's medieval fortifications were demolished and replaced by parks. The duke also started the collection of copperplate engravings that is today part of the Veste Coburg museum. Under his son, Ernest, the ' with what is today the Landestheater Coburg was created. He also rebuilt the Ehrenburg in Gothic revival style. In the mid-19th century, Duke Ernest II supported national and liberal ideas and Coburg hosted the first meeting of the German National Association, the founding of the ' and the first ' (national sports festival). During the 19th century, dynastic marriages created ties with the royal families of Belgium, Bulgaria, Portugal and Britain. This turned the ducal family from the rulers of a fairly obscure backwater duchy into one playing an influential role in European politics. The era of political influence peaked with Leopold Frederick; born Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, becoming the King of Belgium in 1831 and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, born in Schloss Rosenau, marrying his first cousin, Queen Victoria in 1840. The marriage between Albert and Victoria established the present British royal house, which renamed itself Windsor during World War I. This marriage in turn led to a union with Germany's ruling dynasty, the Hohenzollerns, when the couple's eldest child, Victoria, married the future Kaiser Friedrich III. After her marriage, Queen Victoria said of Coburg: Due to the royal connections among the royal houses of Europe, Coburg was the site of many royal Ducal weddings and visits. Britain's Queen Victoria made six visits to Coburg during her 63-year reign. In 1894 the wedding of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha brought together Queen Victoria, her son Edward (future Edward VII), her second son Alfred (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), her daughter the German Dowager Empress Friedrich (Victoria), and many of her grandchildren, such as future Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia (Alix of Hesse), Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the future King George V of the United Kingdom. Old print image of Coburg, seen from the south Veste Coburg at night, 2007 In November 1918, the last Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Charles Edward, abdicated. The Freistaat Coburg which now came into being had to decide whether to become part of Thuringia or Bavaria. In a November 1919 referendum, the locals voted to join Bavaria with an 88% majority. On 1 July 1920, Coburg joined Bavaria. In 1929, Coburg was the first German town in which the Nazi Party won the absolute majority of the popular vote during municipal elections.Man of the Year, TIME Magazine, 2 January 1939 In 1932, Coburg was the first German town to make Adolf Hitler an honorary citizen. Coburg had Jewish citizens as early as the 14th century. In the 1870s they were granted permission to lease permanently the Church of St. Nicholas for conversion into a synagogue. In 1931 an unofficial boycott was imposed against Jewish businesses. In 1932 the municipal council abrogated the lease of St. Nicholas Church, and a year later the synagogue was closed down (it still remains standing). On 25 March 1933, 40 Jews in Coburg were arrested and tortured. They were not released until the affair became internationally known. On 9 November 1938, all Jewish men were interned and Jewish homes, shops, and the school were destroyed. Coburg's Jewish community numbered 68 in 1869, 210 (1.3% of the total population) in 1880, 316 (1.3%) in 1925, and 233 (0.9%) in 1933. Around 150 managed to leave by 1942, either emigrating from Germany or moving to other German cities. The rest were deported to Riga, Izbica, and Theresienstadt in three transports between November 1941 and September 1942.Encyclopedia Judaica: Coburg, Germany The memorial book of the German Federal Archives for the victims of the Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany lists in particular 63 Jewish inhabitants of Coburg, who were deported and mostly murdered.

After World War II, which Coburg survived largely undamaged, the town faced the challenge of integrating over 15,000 refugees. In addition, whilst the other Saxon- Thuringian principalities were incorporated into the German Democratic Republic, Bavarian Coburg became part of West Germany. As a result, the town spent the Cold War years lying right next to the Iron Curtain, surrounded by East German territory on three sides and cut off from much of its natural back country. In 1946, Polish ambassador Oskar R. Lange alleged that Coburg was a base for the Western Allies to organize a Polish armed insurgency led by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders against the Soviet-backed communists in Poland.The Milwaukee Journal ‚Äì Google News Archive Search Demographics Over two-thirds of Coburg's population live in the core town of Coburg rather than in one of the Stadtteile merged with it in the 20th century. Some of those retain a largely rural character. =Religion= Most residents of Coburg are members of the Evangelical Church (Lutheran). Other Christian communities are Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, the ICF Movement, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Old Catholics and the New Apostolic Church, as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are also three communities of Muslims. Coburg had a large Jewish community until the 1940s. Jews had lived there since the 14th century. The old synagogue was a former church. Today it is used by Old Catholics. Coburg became Protestant after the Reformation. All Catholics were persecuted. A new Catholic community was founded in the 19th century. Economy In 1919 and Ernst J√ºngling established the metal works Max Brose & Co. to manufacture car parts. The company is still in operation today, as Brose Fahrzeugteile. In 1950, the Haftpflicht-Unterst√ºtzungs-Kasse kraftfahrender Beamter Deutschlands a. G. (today ) relocated from Erfurt to Coburg. HUK is today the largest employer and largest payer of ' (local corporate tax) in Coburg. Kapp Werkzeugmaschinen has been a manufacturer of machines since 1953, after taking over the production assets of COMAG (Coburger Maschinenbau GmbH). Coburg has an above-average share of goods- producing employees. In 2013, out of 32,962 employees 10,421 worked in the manufacturing or construction sectors (31% vs. a national average of 24%), 4,853 in trade, transport and tourism, 10,381 in professional services and 7,230 in public and private services. Hotels in Coburg counted over 61,000 overnight visitors in 2014 (of which around 53,000 were from Germany). They stayed for a total of almost 120,000 nights, or close to two nights on average.

In 1934, the coat of arms was replaced with one depicting a sword with a swastika on the pommel; the original coat of arms was restored in 1945. Attractions Coburg has the typical features of a former capital of a German princely state. There are numerous houses from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The most important landmarks include: Eastern choir of Morizkirche Casimirianum Schlossplatz with Landestheater and Palais Edinburgh Town hall Stadthaus (town house) * Ehrenburg, a former Franciscan convent built in 1220 and turned into a palace in 1543‚Äì1549. It was repeatedly renovated until the 19th century. Ehrenburg was gutted by fire in 1690 and rebuilt in a Baroque style, with stucco work by North Italian craftsmen that includes a \\"Hall of the Giants\\" (which contains a plaque that states it was the location of the first meeting between Britain's Queen Victoria and Franz Josef Emperor of Austria in 1860). The internal decoration dates from the late 17th to early 18th centuries. Its Gothic Revival exterior was remodelled by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in the 19th century. It now also houses a museum as well as a library. * Stadtkirche St. Moriz (\\"St. Maurice\\", 14th‚Äì16th centuries), is a Gothic edifice on the Hallenkirche plan with two towers. The interior, remade in the 18th century, include the notable funerary moment of Duke Johann Casimir for his parents, a 13 m-tall alabaster sculpture painted with statue and reliefs (1595‚Äì1598). * The medieval Veste Coburg, one of the biggest castles in Germany, built starting in 1225 (upon the site of an 11th-century chapel). It was mostly rebuilt in the 19th century. It has a triple line of walls with numerous towers. Today the Veste Coburg is home to three museums. One is the F√ºrstenbau (ducal palace), with many furnished rooms of the Dukes of Coburg, including the apartment where Martin Luther lived in 1530. Probably the most notable room in the castle (unique in all of Germany) is the Jagdzimmer (hunting room) of 1632, which is entirely made of marquetry wood inlay, done up with over 60 marquetry panels, deeply coffered marquetry ceilings and a wood paneled floor. Another museum is the R√ºstkammer (armory), containing the largest collection of medieval armour and weaponry in Germany, with over 10,500 items. The third is the Kunstsammlungen, which contains a collection of 300,000 copperplate engravings (Kupferstich-Kabinett), a 20,000 piece coin collection (M√ºnzkabinett), a 7,000 piece documentation collection (Briefe & Urkunden), and a 3,500 piece glassware collection (Gl√§ser-Sammlung). * Gymnasium Casimirianum, a Renaissance building begun in 1601 * Arsenal (1616‚Äì21). * Landestheater Coburg, a Neoclassical theatre on Schlossplatz, whose other landmarks include the Ehrenburg, the Palais Edinburgh (1865), the Arkaden (1840) Reithalle (1852) and Marstall (rebuilt in 1920). * The Coburg Doll Museum is located near the Schlossplatz and the city centre.

The seat of the public administration of Coburg was moved here in 1438. The original Gothic building proved to be too small and after 1570 the town bought additional properties and erected a Renaissance building at the corner with Ketschengasse. In another rebuilding in 1750-2 both structures were merged. The appearance of the town hall changed, only the round bay on the corner remained. The old roofs were replaced by the current garret roof and the colourful paintings were added to the fa√ßade in the 18th century. Another renovation took place in 1903, when the balcony to the market square was added and stairwell and entrance were redesigned. * ', a late Renaissance building from 1597‚Äì9 built under Duke Johann Casimir to house the ducal administration.

Coburg is referred to as \\"Europe's Capital of Samba.\\"DAAD ‚Äì Studieren in Deutschland As a result of the large presence of the US Army prior to German re-unification, Americans and American culture are still present in Coburg and the surrounding area. This influence ranges from American-style pubs and restaurants to two sports clubs sponsoring baseball teams. =Trivia= The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council asserts that Frankfurt is traditionally credited with originating the frankfurter. According to the Council, this claim is disputed and the hot dog was created in the late 17th century by Johann Georghehner, a butcher, living in Coburg.National Hot Dog & Sausage Council A popular local delicacy is the Coburger Bratwurst, a sausage (the official measure of which is denoted by the Marshall's staff held by the statue of the town's patron, Sankt Mauritius, located on the town hall and overlooking the square) roasted over a pine cone fire. The sausage is served in a Semmel (a small bread bun, a third the size of the sausage itself), and is highly popular with locals and tourists alike. According to rumours, the Coburger Bratwurst was first produced in 1530 on the occasion of a stay and boarding of Martin Luther and the Electoral Train.

Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms. The origin of Indian art can be traced to pre-historic settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups. In historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures. Indian artist styles historically followed Indian religions out of the subcontinent, having an especially large influence in Tibet, South East Asia and China. Indian art has itself received influences at times, especially from Central Asia and Iran, and Europe. Early Indian art  =Rock art= Rock painting at one of the Bhimbetka rock shelters Rock art of India includes rock relief carvings, engravings and paintings, some (but by no means all) from the South Asian Stone Age. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines. The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by Archibald Carlleyle, twelve years before the Cave of Altamira in Spain, although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899). Dr. V. S. Wakankar discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the Vindhya mountain range. Of these, the c. 750 sites making up the Bhimbetka rock shelters have been enrolled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the earliest paintings are some 10,000 years old. The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called geru, which is a form of Iron Oxide (Hematite). =Indus Valley Civilization ()= Dancing Girl of Mohenjo Daro\\" Despite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of dance. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. Much the most common form of figurative art found is small carved seals. Thousands of steatite seals have been recovered, and their physical character is fairly consistent. In size they range from inch to 1 inches square. In most cases they have a pierced boss at the back to accommodate a cord for handling or for use as personal adornment. Seals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another, on the Pashupati Seal, sitting cross-legged in a yoga-like pose. This figure has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.Marshall, Sir John. Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilisation, 3 vols, London: Arthur Probsthain, 1931 The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.Keay, John, India, a History. New York: Grove Press, 2000. The most famous piece is the bronze Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-Daro, which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.Harle, 15-19 After the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era. It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.Harle, 19-20 =Vedic period= Symbolic, possibly anthropomorphological artefact. Copper Hoard Culture (2nd millennium CE). Mathura Museum. The millennium following the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, coinciding with the Indo-Aryan migration during the Vedic period, is devoid of anthropomorphical depictions. It has been suggested that the early Vedic religion focused exclusively on the worship of purely \\"elementary forces of nature by means of elaborate sacrifices\\", which did not lend themselves easily to anthropomorphological representations. Various artefacts may belong to the Copper Hoard Culture (2nd millennium CE), some of them suggesting anthropomorphological characteristics. Interpretations vary as to the exact signification of these artifacts, or even the culture and the periodization to which they belonged. Some examples of artistic expression also appear in abstract pottery designs during the Black and red ware culture (1450-1200 BCE) or the Painted Grey Ware culture (1200-600 BCE), with finds in a wide area, including the area of Mathura. After a gap of about a thousand years, most of the early finds correspond to what is called the \\"second period of urbanization\\" in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE. The anthropomorphic depiction of various deities apparently started in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, possibly as a consequence of the influx of foreign stimuli initiated with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, and the rise of alternative local faiths challenging Vedism, such as Buddhism, Jainism and local popular cults. =Mauryan art ()= The Pataliputra capital, an early example of Mauryan stone sculpture, displaying Persian and Hellenistic influences. 3rd century BCE, Patna Museum Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka, circa 250 BCE. Sarnath Museum The north Indian Maurya Empire flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub- continent except the extreme south as well as influences from Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia,Harle, 22-28 as shown by the Pataliputra capital. The emperor Ashoka, who died in 232 BCE, adopted Buddhism about half- way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large stupas at key sites from the life of the Buddha, although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place. There is more from various early sites of Indian rock-cut architecture. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the Pillars of Ashoka, which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development.Harle, 22-26 The famous detached Lion Capital of Ashoka, with four animals, was adopted as the official Emblem of India after Indian independence.State Emblem , Know India india.gov.in Mauryan sculpture and architecture is characterized by a very fine Mauryan polish given to the stone, which is rarely found in later periods. Many small popular terracotta figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles. Both animals and human figures, usually females presumed to be deities, are found.Harle, 39-42 =Colossal Yaksha statuary (2nd century BCE)= \\"Mudgarpani\\" Yaksha, circa 100 BCE.Dated 100 BCE in Fig.88 in Art of Mathura, Mathura Museum Yakshas seem to have been the object of an important cult in the early periods of Indian history, many of them being known such as Kubera, king of the Yakshas, Manibhadra or Mudgarpani. The Yakshas are a broad class of nature-spirits, usually benevolent, but sometimes mischievous or capricious, connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest, treasure and wilderness, and were the object of popular worship. Many of them were later incorporated into Buddhism, Jainism or Hinduism. In the 2nd century BCE, Yakshas became the focus of the creation of colossal cultic images, typically around 2 meters or more in height, which are considered as probably the first Indian anthropomorphic productions in stone. Although few ancient Yaksha statues remain in good condition, the vigor of the style has been applauded, and expresses essentially Indian qualities. They are often pot- bellied, two-armed and fierce-looking. The Yashas are often depicted with weapons or attributes, such as the Yaksha Mudgarpani who in the right hand holds a mudgar mace, and in the left hand the figure of a small standing devotee or child joining hands in prayer.Fig. 85 in It is often suggested that the style of the colossal Yaksha statuary had an important influence on the creation of later divine images and human figures in India.\\"The folk art typifies an older plastic tradition in clay and wood which was now put in stone, as seen in the massive Yaksha statuary which are also of exceptional value as models of subsequent divine images and human figures.\\" in The female equivalent of the Yashas were the Yashinis, often associated with trees and children, and whose voluptuous figures became omnipresent in Indian art. Some Hellenistic influence, such as the geometrical folds of the drapery or the walking stance of the statues, has been suggested. According to John Boardman, the hem of the dress in the monumental early Yaksha statues is derived from Greek art. Describing the drapery of one of these statues, John Boardman writes: \\"It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism\\", and suggests it is possibly derived from the Hellenistic art of nearby Bactria where this design is known. In the production of colossal Yaksha statues carved in the round, which can be found in several locations in northern India, the art of Mathura is considered as the most advanced in quality and quantity during this period.\\"With respect to large-scale iconic statuary carved in the round (...) the region of Mathura not only rivaled other areas but surpassed them in overall quality and quantity throughout the second and early first century BCE.\\" in =Buddhist art ()= Crossbar medallion with elephant and riders, Mathura art, circa 150 BCE. The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives. Some key sites are Sanchi, Bharhut and Amaravati, some of which remain in situ, with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved toranas or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.Harle, 105-117, 26-47 Mathura was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.Harle, 59-70 The facades and interiors of rock-cut chaitya prayer halls and monastic viharas have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at Ajanta, Karle, Bhaja and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and bodhisattvas, which are not found before 100 CE at the least. Buddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of the centuries after the conquests of Alexander the Great. This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially Gandhara in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan.Harle, 105-117, 71-84 on Gandhara The Indian Kushan Empire spread from Central Asia to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty.Harle, 68-70 (but see p. 253 for another exception)  Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE ‚Äì 72 BCE)  The Great Stupa at Sanchi, c. 273 BCE ‚Äì 232 BCE (Mauryan Empire), enlarged c. 150 BCE ‚Äì 50 BCE (Shunga Dynasty) With the fall of the Maurya Empire, control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE ‚Äì 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner. A monumental rock-cut cave, the Great Chaitya at Karla Caves, built circa 120 CE One of the most notable examples of the Buddhist stupa from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE ‚Äì 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire. The Great Stupa was enlarged to its present diameter of 120 feet, covered with a stone casing, topped with a balcony and umbrella, and encircled with a stone railing during the Shunga Dynasty c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE. In addition to architecture, another significant art form of the Shunga Dynasty is the elaborately moulded terracotta plaques. As seen in previous examples from the Mauryan Empire, a style in which surface detail, nudity, and sensuality is continued in the terracotta plaques of the Shunga Dynasty. The most common figural representations seen on these plaques are women, some of which are thought to be goddesses, who are mostly shown as bare-chested and wearing elaborate headdresses. Satavahana dynasty (c. 1st/3rd century BCE ‚Äì c. 3rd century CE)  The Satavahana dynasty ruled in central India, and sponsored many large Buddhist monuments, stupas, temples, and prayer-halls, including the Amaravati Stupa, the Karla Caves, and the first phase of the Ajanta Caves. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on a mandala, a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional circumambulation in ritual settings. Also, ancient Indians considered caves as sacred places since they were inhabited by holy men and monks. A chaitya was constructed from a cave. Relief sculptures of Buddhist figures and epigraphs written in Brahmi characters are often found in divine places specific to Buddhism. To celebrate the divine, Satavahana people also made stone images as the decoration in Buddhist architectures. Based on the knowledge of geometry and geology, they created ideal images using a set of complex techniques and tools such as chisels, hammers, and compasses with iron points. In addition, delicate Satavahana coins show the capacity of creating art in that period. The Satavahanas issued coins primarily in copper, lead and potin. Later on, silver came into use when producing coins. The coins usually have detailed portraits of rulers and inscriptions written in the language of Tamil and Telugu. Buddha, Kushan period, 1st‚Äì2nd century CE, Gandhara, Pakistan: Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum).  Kushan Empire (c. 30 CE - c. 375 CE)  Officially established by Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan emperor who united the Yuezhi tribes, the Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central and southern Asia, including the regions of Gandhara and Mathura in northern India. From 127 to 151 CE, Gandharan reached its peak under the reign of Kanishka the Great. In this period, Kushan art inherited the Greco-Buddhist art.Xinru Liu, The Silk Road in World History, New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, 42. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, and the depictions of Buddha as a human form first appeared in art. Wearing a monk's robe and a long length of cloth draped over the left shoulder and around the body, the Buddha was depicted with 32 major lakshanas (distinguishing marks), including a golden- colored body, an ushnisha (a protuberance) on the top of his head, heavy earrings, elongated earlobes, long arms, the impression of a chakra (wheel) on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, and the urna (a mark between his eyebrows). One of the hallmarks of Gandharan art is its relation to naturalism of Hellenistic art. The naturalistic features found in Gandharan sculptures include the three-dimensional treatment of the drapery, with unregularized folds that are in realistic patterns of random shape and thickness. The physical form of the Buddha and his bodhisattvas are well- defined, solid, and muscular, with swelling chests, arms, and abdomens.Lolita Nehru, Origins of the Gandharan Style, p. 63. Buddhism and Buddhism art spread to Central Asia and the far East across Bactria and Sogdia, where the Kushan Empire met the Han Dynasty of China. =Gupta art ()= The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, and survives in the Ajanta Caves, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and Jain tirthankara figures, these last often on a very large scale. The main centres of sculpture were Mathura Sarnath, and Gandhara, the last the centre of Greco-Buddhist art. The Gupta period marked the \\"golden age\\" of classical Hinduism, and saw the earliest constructed Hindu temple architecture, though survivals are not numerous.  Middle kingdoms and the Late Medieval period () Over this period Hindu temple architecture matured into a number of regional styles, and a large proportion of the art historical record for this period consists of temple sculpture, much of which remains in place. The political history of the middle kingdoms of India saw India divided into many states, and since much of the grandest building was commissioned by rulers and their court, this helped the development of regional differences. Painting, both on a large scale on walls, and in miniature forms, was no doubt very widely practiced, but survivals are rare. Medieval bronzes have most commonly survived from either the Tamil south, or the Himalayan foothills. = Dynasties of South India () = Inscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka mention coexistence of the northern kingdoms with the triumvirate of Chola, Chera and Pandya Tamil dynasties, situated south of the Vindhya mountains. The medieval period witnessed the rise and fall of these kingdoms, in conjunction with other kingdoms in the area. It is during the decline and resurgence of these kingdoms that Hinduism was renewed. It fostered the construction of numerous temples and sculptures. The Shore Temple at Mamallapuram constructed by the Pallavas symbolizes early Hindu architecture, with its monolithic rock relief and sculptures of Hindu deities. They were succeeded by Chola rulers who were prolific in their pursuit of the arts. The Great Living Chola Temples of this period are known for their maturity, grandeur and attention to detail, and have been recognized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. The Chola period is also known for its bronze sculptures, the lost-wax casting technique and fresco paintings. Thanks to the Hindu kings of the Chalukya dynasty, Jainism flourished alongside Islam evidenced by the fourth of the Badami cave temples being Jain instead of Vedic. The kingdoms of South India continued to rule their lands until the Muslim invasions that established sultanates there and destroyed much of the temples and marvel examples of architectures and sculptures = Temples of Khajuraho () = Vishvanatha Temple, part of the Khajuraho group of monuments Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Khajuraho group of monuments were constructed by the Chandela clan of the Rajput dynasties. Apart from the usual Hindu temples, 10% of the sculptures depict twisted bodies of men and women that shed light on the everyday socio-cultural and religious practices in Medieval India. Ever since their discovery, the degree of sexuality depicted in these sculptures has drawn both negative and positive criticism from scholars. The Khajuraho temples were in active use under Hindu kingdoms, until the establishment of the Delhi Sultanates of the 13th century. Under Muslim rule until the 18th century, many of Khajuraho's monuments were destroyed, but a few ruins still remain. =Deccan= Other Hindu states are now mainly known through their surviving temples and their attached sculpture. These include Badami Chalukya architecture (5th to 6th centuries), Western Chalukya architecture (11th to 12th centuries) and Hoysala architecture (11th to 14th centuries), all centred on modern Karnataka. In east India, Odisha and West Bengal, Kalinga architecture was the broad temple style, with local variants, before the Muslim conquest. Early Modern and Colonial Era () = Mughal art = Although Islamic conquests in India were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the Mughal Empire that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. Emperor Humayun, during his reestablishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1555, brought with him Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad, two of the finest painters from Persian Shah Tahmasp's renowned atelier. During the reign of Akbar (1556‚Äî1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the Hamzanama in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s. According to court historian Abu'l-Fazal, Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best. It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of Persian miniatures, the Rajput paintings (including the Kangra school) and the Pahari style of Northern India. They also influenced the Company style watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later. With the death of Akbar, his son Jahangir (1605‚Äì1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably Bishan Das, Manohar Das, Abu al-Hasan, Govardhan, and Daulat. Jahangir himself had the capability to identify the work of each individual artist, even if the work was unnamed.The Razmnama (Persian translation of the Hindu epic Mahabharata) and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named Tuzuk-i Jahangiri, were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by Shah Jahan (1628‚Äì1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the Taj Mahal. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts. As painting declined in the imperial court, artists and the general influence of Mughal painting spread to the princely courts and cities of north India, where both portraiture, the illustration of the Indian epics, and Hindu religious painting developed in many local schools and styles. Notable among these were the schools of Rajput, Pahari, Deccan, Kangra painting. = Other medieval Indian kingdoms = The last empire in southern India, until the Mughals conquered it after 1565, has left spectacular remains of Vijayanagara architecture, especially at Hampi, Karnataka, often heavily decorated with sculpture. These developed the Chola tradition. After the Mughal conquest, the temple tradition continued to develop, mainly in the expansion of existing temples, which added new outer walls with increasingly large gopurams, often dwarfing the older buildings in the centre. These became usually thickly covered with plaster statues of deities and other religious figures, which need have their brightly-coloured paint kept renewed at intervals so they do not erode away. In South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the Bahmani sultanate disintegrated into the Deccan sultanates centered at Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504‚Äì1619) of Bidar saw the invention of bidri ware, which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the colour and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art. =British period (1841‚Äì1947)= British colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art, especially from the mid-19th century onwards. Many old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities. The oldest, the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, was established in 1850. In major cities with many Europeans, the Company style of small paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the East India Company. The style mainly used watercolour, to convey soft textures and tones, in a style combining influences from Western prints and Mughal painting. By 1858, the British government took over the task of administration of India under the British Raj. Many commissions by Indian princes were now wholly or partly in Western styles, or the hybrid Indo-Saracenic architecture. The fusion of Indian traditions with European style at this time is evident from Raja Ravi Varma's oil paintings of sari-clad women in a graceful manner. With the Swadeshi Movement gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the Bengal School of Art, led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of Abanindranath Tagore (1871‚Äî1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art. Other artists of the Tagore family, such as Rabindranath Tagore (1861‚Äì1941) and Gaganendranath Tagore (1867‚Äì1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as Amrita Sher-Gil (1913‚Äì1941) were responsible for introducing Avant-garde western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like Jamini Roy and later S.H. Raza took inspiration from folk traditions. In 1944, K.C.S. Paniker founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the \\"madras movement\\" in art. Contemporary art (-present) Group of Three Girls by Amrita Sher-Gil In 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - K. H. Ara, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and Francis Newton Souza - founded the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, Manishi Dey, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, K. G. Subramanyan, A. Ramachandran, Devender Singh, Akbar Padamsee, John Wilkins, Himmat Shah and Manjit Bawa. Present-day Indian art is varied as it had been never before. Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include Bose Krishnamachari and Bikash Bhattacharjee. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was Ismail Gulgee, who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of Islamic calligraphy with an abstract expressionist (or gestural abstractionist) sensibility. Painting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as Nalini Malani, Subodh Gupta, Narayanan Ramachandran, Vivan Sundaram, Jitish Kallat, they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual. The increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like Geeta Kapur, R. Siva Kumar,Shivaji K. Panikkar, Ranjit Hoskote, amongst others, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India. Material history of Indian art =Sculpture= Chola bronze statue of Nataraja at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300‚Äì1700 BC), found in sites at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from Daimabad.Harle, 17‚Äì20 Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of Ashoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.Harle, 22‚Äì24 Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood.Harle, 26‚Äì38 Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in Kerala throughout all historic periods until recent decades.Harle, 342-350 During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara from what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc. The pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550) which remains a \\"classical\\" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves,Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later.Harle, 124 Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated lost wax bronzes of the Chola dynasty (c. 850‚Äì1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja,Harle, 301-310, 325-327 with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty.Harle, 276‚Äì284 The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.Chopra. et al., p. 186. Among the existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi, Siva saints and many more.Tri. [Title needed]. p. 479. =Wall painting= Fresco from the Ajanta Caves, c. 450-500 The tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with rock-cut art and the use of natural caves during the Mesolithic period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are on the edge of the Deccan Plateau where deep erosion has left huge sandstone outcrops. The many caves and grottos found there contain primitive tools and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day. The oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the Ajanta Caves with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE), although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, Bagh, Ellora, and Sittanavasal caves, the last being Jain of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.Harle, 355 The Chola fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the Nayak period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great. Kerala mural painting has well-preserved fresco or mural or wall painting in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, Ettumanoor and Aymanam and elsewhere. =Miniature painting= Akbar riding the elephant Hawa'I pursuing another elephant Although few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the palm-leaf manuscript probably explain the rarity of early examples.Harle, 361-366 Mughal painting in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the Persian miniature tradition imported by the Mughal Emperor's court. New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.Harle, 372-382 Deccan painting developed around the same time in the Deccan sultanates courts to the south, in some ways more vital, if less poised and elegant.Harle, 400-406 Miniatures either illustrated books or were single works for muraqqas or albums of painting and Islamic calligraphy. The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called \\"sub-Mughal\\", including Rajput painting, Pahari painting, and finally Company painting, a hybrid watercolour style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the British raj. In \\"pahari\\" (\\"mountain\\") centres like that of Kangra painting the style remained vital and continued to develop into the early decades of the 19th century.Harle, 407-420 From the mid-19th century Western-style easel paintings became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools. =Jewellery= Pair of gold earrings, 1st century BCE, Andhra Pradesh. The Indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years.Untracht, Oppi. Traditional Jewelry of India. New York: Abrams, 1997 . p15. Using jewellery as a store of capital remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality gemstones, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners. =Other materials= Wood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as ivory or bone were discouraged by the Dharmic religions, although Buddhist examples exist, such as the Begram ivories, many of Indian manufacture, but found in Afghanistan, and some relatively modern carved tusks. In Muslim settings they are more common. Contextual history of Indian art =Temple art= Obscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the Harappans and the definite historic period starting with the Mauryas, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was Buddhism. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references. Soon after the Buddhists initiated rock-cut caves, Hindus and Jains started to imitate them at Badami, Aihole, Ellora, Salsette, Elephanta, Aurangabad and Mamallapuram and Mughals. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the iconography to match the religion commissioning them.Harle, 59 Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations. Indian art also found its way into Italy, within the context of Indo-Roman trade: in 1938 the Pompeii Lakshmi was found in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE). Buddhist art first developed during the Gandhara period and Amaravati Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the Gupta Periods and Pala Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the Pallava, Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagara Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well. There is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the Shore Temple, a part of the Mahabalipuram World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the Bay of Bengal with finely carved granite rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century. =Folk and tribal art= Warli painting from Maharastra Folk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork,dhokra art paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them. Often puranic gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: Nakashi art from Telangana or Cherial Scroll Painting). Folk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The rural, tribal and arts of the nomads constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, Madhubani Art, Manjusha Art, Tikuli Art and Gond etc. While most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling. A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them. The folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures. =Contextual Modernism= The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included Vivan Sundaram, Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, Bhupen Khakhar, and Nalini Malani‚Äîand which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition ‚ÄúPlace for People‚Äù‚Äîwas definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian R. Siva Kumar's benchmark exhibition and related publication, A Contextual Modernism, restored the Santiniketan artists‚ÄîRabindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee, and Ramkinkar Baij‚Äîto their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they ‚Äúreviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.‚Äù art historian R. Siva Kumar The idea of Contextual Modernism emerged in 1997 from R. Siva Kumar's Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of an alternative modernism in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists. Several terms including Paul Gilroy's counter culture of modernity and Tani Barlow's Colonial modernity have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because ‚Äúthe colonial in colonial modernity does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.‚Äùhttp://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming- polarized-modernities.pdf According to R. Siva Kumar \\"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\\" He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice. Contextual Modernism in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture.

Despite not having yet played for either New South Wales or Australia, Roberts signed a contract with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 1990.

Life outside football Roberts came out as gay in 1995, becoming the first rugby league player in the world to do so. He discussed his sexuality in magazines and on television over the following year. The NRL Footy Show principals Paul Vautin, Peter Sterling and Steve Roach appeared in a poster campaign against homophobia conducted by the Lesbian and Gay Anti-Violence Project. He was praised for helping to question prevailing myths about gays and sport. Paul Freeman wrote a book on Roberts, Ian Roberts ‚Äì Finding Out, which was published in 1997.Paul Freeman (1997) Ian Roberts ‚Äì Finding Out, Random House Australia In 1999 Roberts was taken to court by Garry Jack over an on-field brawl that occurred in 1991. Jack stated he was taking a stand against a beating he received from several Manly players. He attempted to sue Roberts for $100,000 in damages, alleging he suffered shock, traumatic injuries to his face and eyes, cuts, headaches and numbness, and was embarrassed by scarring to his face. Jack and Roberts eventually settled the dispute out of court with Roberts handing over more than $50,000.

It will become weekly on Thursdays effective January 2020. The Tribune is part of the Pamplin Media Group, which publishes a number of community newspapers in the Portland metropolitan area. Launched in 2001, the paper was published twice weekly until 2008, when it was reduced to weekly.Portland Tribune makes more cuts, a July 21, 2009 article from the Portland Business Journal It returned to twice- weekly publication in 2014 and was again reduced to weekly publication in 2020. History =2000‚Äì2007= Portland businessman Robert B. Pamplin Jr. announced his intention to found the paper in the summer of 2000. The first issue of the twice-weekly (Tuesdays and Fridays) paper was published February 9, 2001, joining The Oregonian, the city's only daily general-interest newspaper, and the alternative weeklies Willamette Week and The Portland Mercury. At the time, it was a rare example of the expansion of print news, in a time when many cities were seeing newspapers merge or go out of business. But its launch preceded a significant national downturn in advertising sales, which posed difficulties for a startup newspaper. Eleven months after its launch, the Tribune cut back on home deliveries. The newspaper was reportedly losing money faster than anticipated after its first year. By late 2006, its newsroom staff had been reduced to 27. =2008 to present= Tribune newspaper box On May 5, 2008, the paper announced it would switch, effective immediately, to a once-a-week print format, with a Thursday print edition (in place of Tuesday and Fridays) accompanied by daily updates to its website. In July 2009, \\"difficult economic conditions\\" led to the layoff of two reporters and the resignation of its managing editor, resulting in a newsroom staff of 14. In March 2014, the Portland Tribune resumed twice-weekly publication of its print edition, with reinstatement of a Tuesday edition, while continuing to publish a Thursday edition. As of January 2020, the Portland Tribune has once again returned to once-weekly on Thursdays and online articles have been limited to paid subscribers only. Publication of the print edition shifted from Thursday to Wednesdays in April 2020. Coverage The paper deals almost exclusively with issues local to Portland and the U.S. state of Oregon. The paper is known for its extensive coverage of local high school, college and professional sports teams, with concentration on the NBA, Pac-10, Big Sky Conference and West Coast Conference. A business section was added to the print edition in 2014, along with other coverage expansion, including health and fitness content and more regional coverage. The Tribune sponsors the annual Portland Regional Spelling Bee for middle school students. The champion participates in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C.

Modern city names (in Italian, except from Napoli) are provided alongside the medieval Greek names. The Catepanate (or Catapanate) of Italy ( Katepan√≠kion Ital√≠as) was a province of the Byzantine Empire, comprising mainland Italy south of a line drawn from Monte Gargano to the Gulf of Salerno. Amalfi and Naples, although north of that line, maintained allegiance to Constantinople through the catepan. The Italian region of Capitanata derives its name from the Catepanate.  History  Following the fall of the Exarchate of Ravenna in 751, Byzantium had been absent from the affairs of southern Italy for almost a century, but the accession of Basil I (reigned 867‚Äì886) to the throne of Constantinople changed this: from 868 on, the imperial fleet and Byzantine diplomats were employed in an effort to secure the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raids, re-establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia, and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy. As a result of these efforts, Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873, and Bari, captured from Arabs by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II in 871, passed under Byzantine control in 876. The expeditions of the capable general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder in the mid-880s further extended Byzantine control over most of Apulia and Calabria. These victories were followed up by his successors and laid the foundation of a resurgence of Byzantine power in southern Italy, culminating in the establishment of the theme of Longobardia in c. 892. The regions of Apulia, Calabria and Basilicata would remain firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century. In c. 965, a new theme, that of Lucania, was established, and the stratƒìgos (military governor) of Bari was raised to the title of katepan≈ç of Italy, usually with the rank of patrikios. The title of katepan≈ç meant \\"the uppermost\\" in Greek. This elevation was deemed militarily necessary after the final loss of nearby Sicily, a previously Byzantine possession, to the Arabs. Some Norman adventurers, on pilgrimage to Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano, lent their swords in 1017 to the Lombard cities of Apulia against the Byzantines. From 1016 to 1030 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Byzantine or Lombard, and then Duke Sergius IV of Naples, by installing their leader Ranulf Drengot in the fortress of Aversa in 1030. This gave the Normans their first foothold in southern Italy from which they began an organized conquest of the land. In 1030, William and Drogo, the two eldest sons of Tancred of Hauteville, a noble of Coutances in Normandy arrived in southern Italy. The two joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from the Byzantines, who had lost most of that province by 1040. Bari was captured by the Normans in April 1071, and Byzantine authority was finally terminated in Italy, five centuries after the conquests of Justinian I. The Byzantines returned briefly to besiege Bari in 1156. The title Catapan of Apulia and Campania was revived briefly in 1166 for Gilbert, Count of Gravina, the cousin of the queen regent Margaret of Navarre. In 1167, with his authority as catapan, Gilbert forced German troops out of the Campania and compelled Frederick Barbarossa to raise the siege of Ancona.

A left-leaning populist with little political experience before his mayoral bid, he was one of Portland's most colorful political figures. Early life Born in Nampa, Idaho, Clark's family moved to La Grande, Oregon, and then to Portland when he was 6 years old. He graduated from Lincoln High School in 1949, then enlisted in the Marines and attended college at Vanport College (now Portland State University), Oregon State University, and Reed College where he dropped out in his junior year. In 1967, he opened the Goose Hollow Inn tavern in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland. At that time, the neighborhood name was falling into disuse and Clark is now credited with keeping the Goose Hollow neighborhood identity alive.

In 1984, Clark ran for mayor when no other candidate would come forward to challenge Frank Ivancie.Dietrich, Bill (May 20, 1984). \\"'Whoop, whoop!' Portland's new mayor was no flasher in the pan\\". The Seattle Times, p. 1. He won in the primary, on May 15, 1984, with 54.7% of the vote. Under Portland's rules for municipal elections, Clark's winning more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary meant that there would be no runoff election in the fall, and his name was the only name on the ballot in the November general election. In view of this, he was already being referred to as \\"mayor-elect\\" well before November, but was \\"officially\\" elected mayor on November 6, 1984. His term began on January 2, 1985. Upon taking office, Clark found that Ivancie had reduced the city's reserves of $27 million down to a few thousand dollars. Firefighters and police had just received a 10% wage increase, which meant the budget had to be redone in his first months in office. As mayor, Clark created the nationally recognized 12-Point Homeless Plan, supported the growth of mass transit, including the MAX Light Rail line to Gresham, Oregon, aided downtown development, and initiated and led the campaign to build the Oregon Convention Center. Bud Clark also sanctioned The Mayor's Ball, an annual charity event featuring independent musicians from all over the Pacific Northwest. The Mayor's Ball ended after the election of Vera Katz. A spokesperson for Tom Potter (Portland Mayor 2005‚Äì2009), said that the event cost Bud Clark's office $45,000. Potter later admitted that it also pulled in nearly $80,000. Clark was re-elected in 1988 after defeating 11 candidates in the primary and beating former Chief of Police Ron Still in the general. Due to $71,650 in campaign debt (mostly to U.S. Bank with a $52,000 lien against his personal home) from his 1988 campaign, Clark needed to raise money in 1991. A $100-per-plate fundraising event ended up significantly undersold, and the \\"Oregon Political Party\\" fundraiser in the South Park Blocks actually lost money. Managing the city resources with the Portland City Council, Portland had $20 million in reserves at the end of his second term and earned an award from the AMBAC Corporation as the best managed city of its size in the United States. Clark retired from public life and resumed his career as a tavern owner. In 2011, he wrote the foreword to Portland's Goose Hollow, a book about the neighborhood's history. Legacy Clark speaking in front of the Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider equestrian statue in 2013 Clark has a namesake in the Bud Clark Commons, \\"the apartments for hard- luck addiction cases\\" located in Old Town and completed in 2011. Popular culture Clark is known for his eccentricities. While mayor, he commuted to work by bicycle, and was known for his distinctive cry of \\"Whoop, Whoop!\\" Clark is also known as the raincoat-wearing model for a 1978 poster titled \\"Expose Yourself to Art\\",\\"Expose Yourself to Art\\", The Story .

He worked for thirty years in Moscow, from the 1950s until the late 1980s. He now lives and works on Long Island, United States. Throughout his forty-year plus career, Kabakov has produced a wide range of paintings, drawings, installations, and theoretical texts‚Äînot to mention extensive memoirs that track his life from his childhood to the early 1980s. In recent years, he has created installations that evoked the visual culture of the Soviet Union, though this theme has never been the exclusive focus of his work. Unlike some underground Soviet artists, Kabakov joined the Union of Soviet Artists in 1959, and became a full member in 1962. This was a prestigious position in the USSR and it brought with it substantial material benefits. In general, Kabakov illustrated children's books for 3‚Äì6 months each year and then spent the remainder of his time on his own projects. By using fictional biographies, many inspired by his own experiences, Kabakov has attempted to explain the birth and death of the Soviet Union, which he claims to be the first modern society to disappear. In the Soviet Union, Kabakov discovers elements common to every modern society, and in doing so he examines the rift between capitalism and communism. Rather than depict the Soviet Union as a failed Socialist project defeated by Western economics, Kabakov describes it as one utopian project among many, capitalism included. By reexamining historical narratives and perspectives, Kabakov delivers a message that every project, whether public or private, important or trivial, has the potential to fail due to the potentially authoritarian will to power. Early life Ilya Iosifovich Kabakov was born on September 30, 1933 in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His mother, accountant Bertha Judelevna Solodukhina, and his father, locksmith Iosif Bentcionovitch Kabakov, were Jewish. Ilya was evacuated during World War II to Samarkand with his mother. There he started attending the school of the Leningrad Academy of Art that was evacuated to Samarkand. His classmates included the painter Mikhail Turovsky. =Education= From 1945 to 1951, he studied at the Art School, Moscow; in 1957 he graduated from V.I. Surikov State Art Institute, Moscow, where he specialized in graphic design and book illustration. Career In 1959, Kabakov became a \\"candidate member\\" of the Union of Soviet Artists (he later became a full member in 1962). This status secured him a studio, steady work as an illustrator and a relatively healthy income by Soviet standards. He recalls that he was \\"rich\\" compared to most Soviets. =\\"Official\\" vs. \\"unofficial\\" artists= Kabakov, as a book illustrator and official artist, was able to produce his \\"private\\" artwork in his official studio. Between 1953-1955 Kabakov began making his first unofficial works, which he called \\"drawings for myself.\\" The phrase \\"drawings for myself\\" serves as a title for the works and an explanation. None of these early projects amounted to more than sketches on paper. They were never titled, and they were often similar in style to his book illustrations. Throughout his career the tension between official labor and unofficial art would haunt Kabakov. =The 1960s= = End of the \\"Thaw\\" = In 1962, there was an exhibition at the Moscow Artists‚Äô Union that occasioned Nikita Khrushchev‚Äôs infamous attacks on modern art. The incident ended the Thaw Era that had begun in 1956. That same year Kabakov produced several series of ‚Äòabsurd drawings.‚Äô These were eventually published in a 1969 Prague magazine. Prior to this, however, Kabakov had his first taste of publicly challenging the Soviet regime. In 1965 a member of the Italian Communist Party exhibited a number of works by Soviet artists in L'Aquila, Italy. The goal of the show was to prove that the Soviet Union had a more diverse culture than was known to the West and even to the Soviet people. Kabakov lent a series of drawings titled Shower. The Shower Series In the original Shower series from 1965, a man is depicted standing under a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual who is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else‚Äôs name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov‚Äôs unofficial artwork. =The Sretensky Boulevard Group= A group of artists that lived on Sretensky Boulevard became loosely associated by their like-minded ideas in the late 1960s. Primarily identified as Kabakov, Eduard Steinberg, Erik Bulatov, Viktor Pivovarov and Vladimir Yankilevsky, the group also included Oleg Vassiliev, √úlo Sooster and others with the same pre-occupation. The artist's studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. The majority of visual artists who became part of the 'Sretensky Boulevard Group' worked officially as book illustrators and graphic designers. They were in strong contrast to a group called the 'Lianozovo Group' artists, a loose group around Oscar Rabin, who were primarily abstractionists. This group in particular was often harassed and in some cases imprisoned or exiled. It is apparent that Kabakov and his associates were conformist as a survival strategy, a tactic which began at the art academies. Kabakov reports that during school and throughout his early career he did everything expected of him and, on the surface, accepted the Soviet reality. The Russian Series It was at the studio on Sretensky Boulevard that Kabakov‚Äôs unofficial work took a new turn. Previously, his work consisted of relatively modest-sized drawings of approximately 8 x 11 inches. Here, he began to create considerably larger works. The Russian Series, 1969, consists of three paintings. All are 49 x 77 inches and are covered with a sandy brown. Within each, there are minute details and objects alternatively on the surface or hidden beneath the sandy color. The details interrupt the viewer‚Äôs gaze, which would otherwise be overwhelmed by the color of the brown enamel. The Russian Series is a prototype for Kabakov‚Äôs later works because the paintings are accompanied by text. In all three works of The Russian Series the details are located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the ‚Äúsandy color, that of soil‚Äù is left intact, interrupted in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning his gaze to the middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green enamel paint. thumb Kabakov described the colors of paint in The Russian Series and Three Green Paintings as the main characters. The brown sandy soil color of the first series was the same enamel used in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s to paint everything from roofs to hallways, but most often floors. Kabakov points out that the color of the state is red but the color of the country is gray, due to its ‚Äúhumdrum existence‚Äù. Kabakov assigns these colors a metaphysical meaning of earth and nature as controlled and depicted by the Soviet state. He then suggests that if you mix these two colors you end up with the brown sandy soil color, which signifies both the floors and the ground that support the feet of the populace of the Soviet Union. The green of the second series is enamel that was used to paint the lower part of the walls up to one meter high in order to protect them from dirt and scuffs. For Kabakov, these colors evoke feelings of unavoidable hopelessness. More pertinent to this argument is what these series of paintings do not address. Political ideology is absent and only impersonal colors exist to dominate minor features, all of which are faceless texts and objects. The Fly Throughout the 1960s, Kabakov‚Äôs work became more experimental and irregular. Some of his best-known motifs begin to develop in this decade. For example, Queen Fly of 1965 is a smaller and quite unique work in that a decorative, semi-geometric design covers a plywood base and frame. However the fly, a lone element separate from the painted pattern, is also the main character, and one that reoccurs throughout Kabakov‚Äôs oeuvre. The fly motif is so important that it remained in his work until after he moved to the West. The 1992 installation in Cologne, Life of Flies, consists of several halls in which the economy, politics, culture, and an entire civilization, specifically the Soviet Union, are associated with flies. The civilization has an atmosphere so boring that flies die from it. Throughout Kabakov‚Äôs oeuvre the flies represent two seemingly different themes: human lives and garbage. =The 1970s= In the 1970s, several factors led Kabakov to become more conceptually oriented. The first was the Soviet intelligentsia‚Äôs adoption of the structuralist theory from France, which helped shift interest from art object to its context. Next, perhaps in part due to the influence of structuralism, the intelligentsia began to question the friend-or-foe attitude toward Soviet ideology. Dissident artists and intellectuals began to be seen by Russian structuralists as supporting the gulf within society and between the industrialist societies of the East and West. In the 1970s, rather than be anti-Soviet and pro-Western, many artists took a neutral position that would allow them to question and analyze the perceived gap between the ideologies. The Moscow Conceptualists For Kabakov, these developments led to his friends and colleagues forming a group that became known as the Moscow Conceptualists, which developed out of the Sretensky Boulevard Group. It is problematic to determine exactly who was a member of the group, as the term is fluid, broadly encompassing the Sots artists and the Collective Actions group, which both were influential in the construction of Russian conceptualist art. Albums and Ten Characters Prior to creating the installations for which Kabakov is known worldwide, Kabakov created fictional albums. He has created a total of 50. Each album is a story about one character who is often able to overcome the banality of everyday existence, or, \\"of a small man, possessed by big ideas.\\" The first ten albums is a series called Ten Characters (1972‚Äì75). In the story of the Ten Characters, a man, attempting to write his autobiography, realizes that nothing much ever happened to him, and most of his life amounted to impressions of people, places, and objects. So he creates ten different characters to explain his perception of the world. Each story is text with illustration, demonstrating that Kabakov‚Äôs official work as a book illustrator is a strong presence in his \\"unofficial\\" work as well. In one of the albums from Ten Characters, called The Flying Komarov, average Soviet citizens grasp the wings of undersized versions of airplanes, some being pulled by ropes like water skiers in the sky. The illustrations also depict, in a cartoon-like fashion, the townspeople holding hands and forming large circles while floating in the air. The drawings are highly fanciful and could easily be used for a children‚Äôs book, if not in the Soviet Union then certainly in the West. The written explanation, however, suggests a deeper, perhaps more cynical meaning. Kabakov claims the albums are a genre somewhere between several types of art including literature, fine arts, and cinematography. ‚ÄúMost of all,‚Äù he suggests, ‚Äúthe ‚Äòalbums‚Äô are a type of ‚Äòdomestic theater‚Äô‚Ä¶like old theater conducted on a town square in broad daylight\\". He compares his albums to theater where the viewer is bound by action and darkness, which does not allow for examination and evaluation of the action. The interest in giving the viewer the freedom to interact with and interpret the artwork is central to Kabakov‚Äôs oeuvre. None of his works are didactic or attempt to deliver a political statement. The 1980s Unlike many Soviet artists who emigrated to the West in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kabakov remained in Russia until 1987. His first trip to the West was to Graz, Austria when the Kunstverein gave him an artistic residency. Between 1988 and 1992, Kabakov claimed no permanent home yet stayed in the West, working and living only briefly in various countries. In comparison to many Soviet √©migr√© artists, Kabakov was immediately successful and has remained so ever since. Between 1988 and 1989, he had exhibitions in New York City, Bern, Venice, and Paris. Between 1983 and 2000, Kabakov created 155 installations. Personal life In 1989, Kabakov also began working with his niecehttps://birdinflight.com/ru/pochemu_eto_shedevr/20170706-ilya-kabakov-i- ego-kontseptualnye-zhuki.htmlhttps://24smi.org/celebrity/66598-ilia- kabakov.html Emilia, who would later become his wife https://birdinflight.com/ru/pochemu_eto_shedevr/20170706-ilya-kabakov-i-ego- kontseptualnye-zhuki.html and who emigrated from the USSR in 1975. Exhibitions and collectors Following Mikhail Chemiakin's 1995 show, Ilya Kabakov had one of the first major solo exhibitions of a living Russian artist at the new State Hermitage Museum in 2004. His works are in the collections of the Zimmerli Art Museum, the Centre Pompidou (Beaubourg), Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim, The Hermitage, Tretjakov Gallery (Moscow), Norway Museum Of Contemporary Art, and museums in Columbus, Ohio, Frankfurt, K√∂ln, etc. In 2017 the Tate Modern in London exhibited Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. set up an exhibition Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: The Utopian Projects.

In typical Lanza fashion, the star had encountered the youngster while in Rome and insisted on her appearing in the film. Lanza also performs a sequence of imitations of famous singers of the era -- Perry Como; Frankie Laine; Dean Martin; and Louis Armstrong- \\"When The Saints Go Marching In\\" -- committing to film what was one of his favorite party performances. Opera selections include \\"Questa o quella\\" from Rigoletto. Production The film was directed by Roy Rowland and was the first of only four films produced by Lester Welch. The screenplay was the last written by Art Cohn, who died two months after the film's release in the same airplane crash that killed famed producer Mike Todd, whose biography Cohn was writing at the time. Cohn partnered with Giorgio Prosperi on the script for the Lanza film, which was based on a story by Giuseppe Amato. The Italian title, Arrivederci Roma, was meant to be the American title of a film Lanza was scheduled to make in 1960, until he died in Rome in October 1959. Reception The film performed well at the box office. According to MGM records it earned $680,000 in the US and Canada and $1,275,000 in other countries, resulting in a profit of $162,000 for MGM.

It is covered by the Sai Kung North constituency at the Tai Po District Council. Nai Chung lies in a larger area collectively known as Shap Sze Heung. Features It contains barbecue sites, which are popular destinations of school picnics, and some restaurants that serve Thai and Indian food. Transport Sai Sha Road, which connects Ma On Shan to Sai Kung, is the only road that goes via Nai Chung. Kowloon Motor Bus has bus routes that serve Nai Chung: * Route # 86P: Nai Chung -> Wu Kai Sha station (Tuen Ma line) -> Sha Tin station * Route # 87E: Nai Chung -> Wu Kai Sha station (Tuen Ma line) -> Tsim Sha Tsui * Route # 99: Ma On Shan <-> Wu Kai Sha station (Tuen Ma line) <-> Nai Chung <-> Sai Kung * Route # 99R: University Station <-> Ma On Shan <-> Nai Chung <-> Sai Kung * Route # 299X: Sha Tin Town Centre <-> Nai Chung <-> Sai Kung There are also two green minibus routes go there. * Route # 807B: University Station (East Rail line) <-> Nai Chung <-> Shui Long Wo <-> Mak Pin * Route # 807K: University Station (East Rail line) <-> Nai Chung <-> Tseng Tau External links * Delineation of area of existing village Nai Chung (Sai Kung North) for election of resident representative (2019 to 2022) Places in Hong Kong Tai Po District Populated places in Hong Kong ","title":"Nai Chung"},{"id":"1789612","text":"George's Spaghetti House was a jazz club located at 290 Dundas Street East in Toronto. History In 1956 entrepreneur Doug Cole (1925‚Äì2012) bought the restaurant, keeping the existing name. Cole began to feature jazz at the restaurant on weekend evenings, and starting on 5 September 1960 booked music six nights per week. Saxophonist Moe Koffman served as the booking agent for the club. As a result, Koffman frequently booked himself into the club, giving rise to a running joke amongst Toronto's jazz fans and musicians, who would phone the club and say, \\"I'd like to know who is playing tonight, and I won't take Moe for an answer.\\" Nevertheless, many of Canada's most famous jazz musicians played at the club, including Don Thompson, Ed Bickert, Guido Basso, Doug Riley, Terry Clarke, and Rob McConnell. Cole later opened a restaurant called Castle George on the second floor of the building. He also operated two other clubs in Toronto: Bourbon Street and Basin Street, which occupied the upstairs and downstairs portions of 180 Queen Street West. Cole sold George's in 1983. For his role in the development of jazz in Canada, Cole was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2008. He died June 14, 2012.

Early life and education Rehn was born on 6 April 1935 in Helsinki, Finland. She spent her childhood in M√§nts√§l√§, where her father worked as a community medical doctor. Rehn went to a local school in M√§nts√§l√§ before entering a boarding school in Kauniainen. Rehn received the degree of master of science in economics in 1957 and has honorary degrees in political science from both Hanken School of Economics and √Öbo Akademi University. In the beginning of the 1960s Rehn was known to be the first person in Finland to import and market the plastic Tupperware containers. Career Rehn was the parliamentary leader of the Swedish People's Party from 1987 to 1990. She was appointed defence minister in 1990 and held the post until 1995. In addition, she served as the minister of equality from 1991 to 1995. Next she was a member of the European Parliament from 1995 to 1997. In the 1994 and 2000 presidential elections, she ran for the office. She had a high profile as the first female Minister of Defence of Finland and Europe.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/19/europes- defence-minister-roles-become-female-stronghold-sylvie-goulard In 1995, during Rehn's term as minister of defence, a law on voluntary female enlistment was enacted.

Generally, dewetting describes the process of retraction of a fluid from a non-wettable surface it was forced to cover. The opposite process‚Äîspreading of a liquid on a substrate‚Äîis called wetting. The factor determining the spontaneous spreading and dewetting for a drop of liquid placed on a solid substrate with ambient gas, is the so-called spreading coefficient S: Surface tension diagram of a liquid droplet on a solid substrate. The surface of the liquid has the shape of a spherical cap, due to Laplace pressure S\\\\ = \\\\gamma_\\\\text{SG} - \\\\gamma_\\\\text{SL} - \\\\gamma_\\\\text{LG} where \\\\gamma_\\\\text{SG} is the solid-gas surface tension, \\\\gamma_\\\\text{SL} is the solid-liquid surface tension and \\\\gamma_\\\\text{LG} is the liquid-gas surface tension (measured for the mediums before they are brought in contact with each other). When S>0, the spontaneous spreading occurs, and if S<0, partial wetting is observed, meaning the liquid will only cover the substrate to some extent. The equilibrium contact angle \\\\theta_\\\\text{c}is determined from the Young-Laplace equation. Spreading and dewetting are important processes for many applications, including adhesion, lubrication, painting, printing, and protective coating. For most applications, dewetting is an unwanted process, because it destroys the applied liquid film. Dewetting can be inhibited or prevented by photocrosslinking the thin film prior to annealing, or by incorporating nanoparticle additives into the film.Carroll, Gregory T.; Turro, Nicholas J.; Koberstein, Jeffrey T. (2010) Patterning Dewetting in Thin Polymer Films by Spatially Directed Photocrosslinking Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 351, pp 556-560 Surfactants can have a significant effect on the spreading coefficient. When a surfactant is added, it's amphiphilic properties cause it to be more energetically favorable to migrate to the surface, decreasing the interfacial tension and thus increasing the spreading coefficient (i.e. making S more positive). As more surfactant molecules are absorbed into the interface, the free energy of the system decreases in tandem to the surface tension decreasing, eventually causing the system to become completely wetting. In biology, by analogy with the physics of liquid dewetting, the process of tunnel formation through endothelial cells has been referred to as cellular dewetting.  Dewetting of polymer thin films  In most dewetting studies a thin polymer film is spin-cast onto a substrate. Even in the case of S<0 the film does not dewet immediately if it is in a metastable state, e.g. if the temperature is below the glass transition temperature of the polymer. Annealing such a metastable film above its glass transition temperature increases the mobility of the polymer-chain molecules and dewetting takes place. The process of dewetting occurs by the nucleation and growth of randomly formed holes, which coalesce to form a network of filaments, before breaking into droplets. When starting from a continuous film, an irregular pattern of droplets is formed. The droplet size and droplet spacing may vary over several orders of magnitude, since the dewetting starts from randomly formed holes in the film. There is no spatial correlation between the dry patches that develop. These dry patches grow and the material is accumulated in the rim surrounding the growing hole. In the case where the initially homogeneous film is thin (in the range of ), a polygon network of connected strings of material is formed, like a Voronoi pattern of polygons. These strings then can break up into droplets, a process which is known as the Plateau-Rayleigh instability. At other film thicknesses, other complicated patterns of droplets on the substrate can be observed, which stem from a fingering instability of the growing rim around the dry patch. File:100nm hole (2).jpgCircular hole formed in a 100 nm thick film of polystyrene. The blue color of the film is due to Structural coloration and depends on the film's thickness. File:AFM height profile for 100nm hole.jpgAFM height profile of a dewetting hole's rim. Notice that the material that is removed by dewetting is accumulated at the rim around the hole; initial film thickness (height): 100 nm. File:100nm tessellation.jpgVoronoi tessellation pattern of polygons achieved by the coalescence of dewetting holes. File:100nm droplets.jpgIf given enough time, this network of polygons decays into separate droplets. File:200nm unstable.jpgRim instability in the case of a thicker (200 nm) polystyrene film.  Dewetting of metal thin films  Solid- state dewetting of the metal thin films describe the transformation of a thin film into an energetically favoured set of droplets or particles at temperatures well below the melting point. The driving force for dewetting is the minimization of the total energy of the free surfaces of the film and substrate as well as of the film-substrate interface. The dedicated heating stage in SEM has been widely used to accurately control sample temperature through a thermocouple to observe the in-situ behaviour of the material, and can be recorded as a video format. Meanwhile, the two-dimensional morphology can be directly observed and characterised. ie. the partially dewetted Ni film is itself a workable fuel electrode for SOCs as it provides long TPB lines if the structure is fine enough, the connectivity of the nickel and pore phases as well as the TPB lines can be used for SOFC characterisation.

A small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park is geographically part of the Monaro. While the Australian Capital Territory is not considered part of the region, some towns in the Monaro have close links with Canberra. The Snowy Monaro Regional Council was established in 2016 which comprises the former Bombala, Cooma-Monaro and Snowy River Local Government Areas. The area was traditionally inhabited by Ngarigo, Walgalu, Bidawal and Southern Ngunnawal people. It boasts of snowfields, expansive timber forests and the Snowy River. Location and features The Monaro region is a plateau area lying about 1000 metres above sea level, extending from the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north to the Errinundra Plateau in the south, and dropping rather sharply to the coast on its eastern side. Much of the region is an ancient highland, but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel that produce the only true chernozems in the whole continent, which are some of the best soils in Australia. Elsewhere the granitic soils are heavily leached and very infertile, supporting a dry forest vegetation before clearing for pastures. Because it is located east of the Snowy Mountains, the rain-bearing westerly winds deposit rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow. Annual rainfall ranges from 430 millimetres (17 inches) around Dalgety to 700 millimetres (26 inches) at the eastern edge of the plateau, where occasional cyclonic storms can produce extremely heavy rainfall - in one day in June 1975 Nimmitabel received 256 millimetres (over 10 inches) of rain. Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm, with average maxima ranging from 28 ¬∞C (82 ¬∞F) around Canberra and Queanbeyan to 22 ¬∞C (71 ¬∞F) on the highest parts of the plateau. Nights in summer can be cool, but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps, with July minima averaging -0.3 ¬∞C (31.5 ¬∞F) in Canberra and -1.5 ¬∞C (29.3 ¬∞F) in Bombala. The Monaro region is characterised by rolling hills that rise to extremely rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains and to shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee. The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages. Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for really reliable cropping (Nimmitabel has had frosts in January), the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle. The Monaro Highway is the main State highway which runs from Canberra south through the Monaro region. Other major roads in the region are the Snowy Mountains Highway which crosses the Monaro between Tumut and Bega, the Kosciuszko Road from Cooma to Jindabyne, and the Snowy River Way from Bombala to Jindabyne. The main towns in the region are Cooma, Jindabyne, Berridale and Bombala, whilst other towns and villages include Adaminaby, Delegate, Dalgety, Nimmitabel, Bredbo, Michelago, Maffra, Numeralla, and Cathcart. Larger localities within the Monaro include Shannons Flat, Yaouk, Eucumbene, Bunyan, Jerangle, Countegany and Kybeyan.

Its design goal is to be lightweight and portable. NetSurf provides features including tabbed browsing, bookmarks and page thumbnailing. The NetSurf project was started in April 2002 in response to a discussion of the deficiencies of the RISC OS platform's existing web browsers. Shortly after the project's inception, development versions for RISC OS users were made available for download by the project's automated build system. NetSurf was voted \\"Best non-commercial software\\" four times in Drobe Launchpad's annual RISC OS awards between 2004 and 2008. NetSurf supports both mainstream systems (e.g. macOS and Unix-like) and older or uncommon platforms (e.g. AmigaOS, Haiku, Atari TOS and RISC OS). The browser was ranked in 2011 as in an article highlighting 10 browsers for Linux published in TechRepublic and ZDNet. It was referred to in 2010 as a superior CLI browser to w3m.  Features  NetSurf's multi-platform core is written in ANSI C, and implements most of the HTML 4 and CSS 2.1 specifications using its own bespoke layout engine. As of version 2.0, NetSurf uses Hubbub, an HTML parser that follows the HTML5 specification. As well as rendering GIF, JPEG, PNG and BMP images, the browser also supports formats native to RISC OS, including Sprite, Draw and ArtWorks files. It was suggested by developer John-Mark Bell in 2007 that support for JavaScript could be added. This feature did not make it into NetSurf v2 back in 2008, nor into NetSurf v3 of 2013, but as of December 2012 there are some NetSurf preview-builds available which contain early-stage JavaScript support (later much improved). On April 20, 2013, NetSurf 3.0 was released.  History  NetSurf began in April 2002 as a web browser for the RISC OS platform. Work on a GTK port began in June 2004 to aid development and debugging. It has since gained many of the user interface features present in the RISC OS version. The browser is packaged with several distributions including Ubuntu, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. After five years of development, the first stable version of the browser was released on 19 May 2007 to coincide with the Wakefield RISC OS show. Version 1.0 was made available for download from the project's web site and the software was sold on CD at the show. After the release of NetSurf 1.0 there were two point-releases, which largely comprised bug fixes. NetSurf 1.1 was released in August 2007 and in March 2008 the NetSurf 1.2 release was made available. NetSurf participated in Google Summer of Code in 2008 as a mentoring organisation, running four projects. These included improving the GTK front end, adding paginated PDF export support and developing the project's HTML 5 compliant parsing library, Hubbub. All NetSurf development builds since 11 August 2008 have used Hubbub to parse HTML and it is available for use in other projects under the MIT license. NetSurf was again accepted as a mentoring organisation into Google Summer of Code 2009. The projects they ran included development of LibDOM, the project's Document Object Model, and improvement of NetSurf's user interface. The interface work included moving previously RISC OS-only functionality to the multi-platform core, including bookmarks, global history, cookie management and page search features. A port to the Windows operating system was also started. In 2010 the NetSurf project did not apply to participate in Google Summer of Code due to the developers having other commitments. * NetSurf 2.0 was released in April 2009 for RISC OS, Linux and other Unix-like platforms, BeOS, Haiku, and AmigaOS 4. This was the first version to use the project's HTML5 parsing library, Hubbub. * In May 2009 a maintenance release, NetSurf 2.1, was issued to users. It incorporated bug fixes and some improvements to page layout. * NetSurf 2.5 was released in April 2010. This was the first release to use the project's library for CSS parsing and selection, LibCSS and a new internal cache for fetched content. * September 2010 saw the release of NetSurf 2.6, which included a number of fixes and improvements. * NetSurf 2.7 was released in April 2011, and added treeview support for features including bookmarking (called the Hotlist manager in NetSurf), history management, and cookie management. It was also the first version to be released for Mac OS X. * In September 2011 NetSurf 2.8 was released. It added support for frames and iframes in the browser's core rendering engine, making them available to all front ends. The release also included support for MIME type sniffing and improved the performance of loading the images used by a web page. * In April 2012 NetSurf 2.9 was released. The most significant changes were new multi-tasking behaviour, optimised URL handling, fetcher optimisations, cache optimisations, and faster CSS selection. * In April 2013 NetSurf 3.0 was released. The biggest difference was the use of the new Document Object Model library, LibDOM. This new library is a foundation that paves the way for NetSurf developers to implement a fully dynamic layout engine in the future. Other improvements in NetSurf 3.0 include completely new textarea support, ability to fetch and parse CSS in parallel with HTML documents, extensive behind-the-scenes refactoring, and a host of smaller changes and fixes. * In April 2014 NetSurf 3.1 was released, containing many improvements over the previous release. The highlights include much faster CSS selection performance, faster start up time, new look and feel to the treeviews (hotlist/bookmarks, global history and cookie manager), improved options handling, undo/redo support in textareas, and general improvement of forms. Also included are many other additions, optimisations and bug fixes. * In July 2019 NetSurf 3.9 was released, with support for CSS Media Queries (level 4) and improvements to JavaScript handling.  Ports  GTK NetSurf running under Linux A native BeOS/Haiku port has been developed. Since the GTK version was built for AmigaOS, using Cygnix which provides an X11 environment, a native AmigaOS port has also been developed. In January 2009, NetSurf was made available on MorphOS, an operating system that is API-compatible with AmigaOS. A Windows port is also available for download. A framebuffer port was created in September 2008. Unlike the other ports, it does not use any GUI toolkit, but instead renders its own mouse pointer, scrollbars and other widgets. The framebuffer front end has been used to create a web kiosk on embedded systems. In January 2010, the NetSurf Developers announced the release of what they expected at the time to be the last release for RISC OS. Lead developer John- Mark Bell said at the time \\"Realistically, the people qualified to maintain the RISC OS port are up to their necks in other stuff.\\" Subsequently, Steve Fryatt volunteered himself as maintainer. January 2011 saw the announcement of a Mac OS X port. A port to Atari 16-bit and 32-bit computers was also started in January 2011.

They were executed during the two months at the end of 1888 that his artist friend Paul Gauguin spent with him at The Yellow House in Arles, France. Les Alyscamps Following months of correspondence, Paul Gauguin joined van Gogh in Arles in October 1888. Both were intent on depicting a \\"non-naturalist landscape\\". The paintings are among the first works that the pair painted following Gauguin's arrival. Van Gogh and Gauguin visited an ancient Roman necropolis, Les Alyscamps, which had been built outside the city walls. Over time the grounds were overtaken by factories and the railroad. The city relocated some of the sarcophagi in a long alley lined with benches and poplar trees that led to a Romanesque chapel which became known as the All√©e des Tombeaux. It quickly became a lover's lane celebrated throughout France.Gayford pp. 76-8Naifeh and Smith pp. 667-8 The paintings During a period of bad weather van Gogh worked on a second pair of \\"Les Alyscamps\\" paintings, which were taken from a vantage point above the lane and looking through the poplar trees, made in the studio. The yellow- orange of the leaves contrast with the violet-blue trunks of the poplar trees. This painting, made shortly after Gauguin's arrival in Arles, was unique in van Gogh's body of work and representative of the artistic achievements realised by two great artists working together. To √âmile Bernard, van Gogh described the collaborative process as a pooling of thoughts and techniques where each artist creates their own unique work that is different, yet complements one another. Van Gogh believed that his pair of paintings Falling Autumn Leaves was just such a collaborative effort influenced by his own ideas as well as those of Gauguin and Bernard.Gayford p.72 The paintings were made on Gauguin's jute which with Van Gogh's brushstroke made a finished tapestry- like texture. The high vantage point represented in the work resembled that of Gauguin's Vision After the Sermon. Creating a composition of a landscape viewed through the trunks of trees was something used previously by Bernard. Van Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to intensify the effect of each color. The blue poplar trunks against the yellow path of leaves. Green used against red. Violet was paired with apricot. To his sister, Vincent wrote of selection and placement of colors \\"which cause each other to shine brilliantly, which form a couple, which complete each other like man and woman.\\"Gayford pp. 72-4 Van Gogh's imagination created the figures in the paintings. In one, a couple of a thin man with an umbrella is paired with a large woman, much like van Gogh's image of a woman he might settle down with. On the lane is also a red-dressed woman. The other painting holds a couple who walk along the lane between stone sarcophagi, a yellow sunset at their backs. Van Gogh's other Les Alyscamps paintings Van Gogh made another pair of paintings at Les Alyscamps.

The working title was Running Scared.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19331/The- Ghost-and-Mr-Chicken/notes.html The title is presumably a humorous variation of the film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947). Plot Luther Heggs is a typesetter for the Rachel Courier Express in Rachel City, Kansas who lives at the Natalie Miller boarding house and aspires to be a reporter. But Luther is not taken seriously, being mocked by his peers when an assumed murder near the supposedly haunted house known as the Simmons Mansion was actually a local drunk who had merely been knocked unconscious by his irate wife. The next morning, Heggs overhears full-time reporter Ollie Weaver making light of his mistake. Ollie happens to be dating Alma Parker, a young woman Luther has a crush on. While at work, asked to add some \\"filler\\" to the paper, Luther learns from the newspaper's janitor Mr. Kelsey, who was a gardener at the Simmons Mansion, that the haunted house was the site of a murder-suicide committed by Mr. Simmons who killed his wife with a bladed instrument before jumping to his death from the organ loft. Legend has it that the ghost of Mr. Simmons can still occasionally be heard playing the organ at midnight. Luther is encouraged by Kelsey to write about the Simmons Mansion with his article a hit with the public, resulting in him being assigned to spend the night in the manor on the 20th anniversary of the murder-suicide. Luther musters the courage to enter the mansion, finding a hidden passage in the book shelf leading to the organ loft. At midnight, Luther runs down stairs when the old organ begin to play by itself, finding pruning shears stabbed in a portrait of Mrs. Simmons. His eerie story gets the town abuzz and causes a delay in the agenda of Nicholas Simmons, the nephew of the deceased couple who intends to demolish the mansion. With the bank unable to complete the arrangements due to his spiritualist wife, Nicholas decides to discredit Luther by taking him and Rachel Courier Express to court for libel. Luther's credibility is questioned when Nicholas's attorney brings in the former's grade school teacher as a character witness, Luther's testimony then twisted to make it appear that he concocted the story in the Simmons Manor to win a job as a full-time reporter. Luther's dramatic denial prompts the judge to order the jury and all interested parties to reconvene at the Simmons house before midnight to confirm the story. But nothing happens with everyone concluding that Luther made it all up, Alma having separated from the group prior to them reaching the organ loft. Everyone leaves the mansion, with Luther about to walk home when he hears the old organ and finds it played by Kelsey. Kelsey confesses of being responsible for the mysterious happenings Luther witnessed, unable to help Luther confirm his story as he was kept out of the mansion by officer Herkie taking his job as a security guard seriously. Kelsey explains that he needs Luther's help to expose the true case of Mr. Simmons's death before they hear a scream from the secret passage, finding Nicholas holding Alma captive. Kelsey confronts Simmons for his attempt of implicating him in the murder of the Simmons couple, the murder weapon used to killed Mrs. Simmons revealed to be Kelsey's shears. Nicholas is revealed to be tearing down the Simmons Mansion to destroy the hidden passage he used as his alibi. Luther rescues Alma by knocking Nicholas unconscious with a full body lunge from behind, the murderer is tied up to be arrested by the police with Kelsey explaining everything. Alma takes Luther's hand, grateful for his heroic act in saving her as they later marry at a small ceremony. At the end of the wedding, the wedding's organ music suddenly changes to the spooky organ music of the Simmons' mansion. Everyone turns to see the small organ's keys moving by themselves, hinting that there really is a ghost after all.

Knotts was best known at the time of the film's production for his Emmy Award-winning five seasons on the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show as small town deputy sheriff Barney Fife. Andy Griffith, Knotts' co-star on The Andy Griffith Show, suggested expanding on an episode from the television series involving a deserted house (the old Rimshaw house in the episode \\"Haunted House\\" aired October 1963) in which Barney, Gomer, and Andy retrieve a baseball of Opie and his friend from the house. Another Andy Griffith Show connection is a small role played by Hal Smith, who had a recurring role on the show. Knotts left the television series at the end of the 1964‚Äì65 season in order to pursue a film career. He had already starred in The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964). Knotts' popularity prompted a multiple-movie deal with Universal, starting with this movie, and followed by The Reluctant Astronaut (1967), The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), The Love God? (1969), and How to Frame a Figg (1971). The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was directed by Alan Rafkin with a screenplay by Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum; all three men had been associated with the success of The Andy Griffith Show. Several players from the television series also appear in the film including Lurene Tuttle, Burt Mustin, Hal Smith and Hope Summers. Viewers will also recognize several actors and actresses who had appeared or were then appearing on other sitcoms of the time. The movie boasts one of the largest collection of character actors/actresses assembled in a single movie. Universal contract star Joan Staley was known by Alan Rafkin from their work together on the sitcom Broadside. Normally a blonde, she had to wear a dark wig because the producers felt she was \\"too sexy\\" as a blonde (she was actually Playboys \\"Miss November\\" 1958, but was photographed very modestly, being only partially nude) and the role called for a brunette. She wore the same wig previously worn by Claudia Cardinale in Blindfold (1966).p.62 Lisanti, Tom Fantasy Femmes of Sixties Cinema: Interviews with 20 Actresses from Biker, Beach, and Elvis Movies McFarland, 2001 Al Checco, Knotts' Army-days comedy partner, had an uncredited appearance in the film. The \\"Simmons Mansion\\", a three-story Second-Empire Victorian house, stands on Colonial Street on the Universal Studios lot in California and was built for the film So Goes My Love (1946). It appeared as the Dowd house in the film Harvey (1950), and, with several alterations to the architecture, served as the home of Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives (2004-2012). The Studio Tour.com ‚Äì Colonial Street The \\"Simmons Mansion\\" is not the Munster house, although they are next door to each other on the new (relocated) Colonial street, with the Munster house on the right. Originally they were on the old Colonial street, which was located next to New York street and Courthouse Square, with the Munster house to the left of the \\"Simmons Mansion\\". The old Colonial Street is where The Ghost and Mr Chicken movie was filmed. Knotts personally called the Bon Ami company president to get permission to mention the cleaning product's name in one of the film's running gags. The original cut of the film included a scene where the portrait stabbing was explained. Kelsey had printed a copy of the portrait and placed on the back side of the one on the landing of the staircase. When pressing a secret button, the portrait turned to reveal the shears stuck in the throat with red paint. This scene was cut from all other prints and has only been seen a few times in theaters and on some television showings. Home media The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was released on VHS on April 30, 1996. Universal released the film on DVD September 2, 2003 and again on January 9, 2007, and on Blu-ray on October 4, 2016.http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Ghost-and-Mr- Chicken-Blu-ray/162487/ Soundtrack On July 12, 2005, Percepto released the soundtrack on Compact Disc.

Ports for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation and Windows were released in 1997. In the game, players control one of ten fighters who have been given great power by a mysterious ore that crashed-landed on Earth from outer space. The object of the game is to defeat all the other fighters to become the most powerful warrior on the planet. The game was heavily influenced by Midway's Mortal Kombat series, and features controls similar to the Mortal Kombat games, as well as the series' signature fatalities. Unique to War Gods is the \\"3D\\" button, allowing users to use the background/foreground for additional attacks and evasive maneuvers. The game's graphics were created using a technology by Midway called \\"digital skin\\", which mapped photographs onto 3D models. War Gods received mixed reviews, with particular criticism being directed at the game's character design and animations. Gameplay The game plays similarly to Mortal Kombat 4, using an almost identical button layout of high/low punches and kicks. The \\"Run\\" button was replaced with a \\"3D\\" button that, when held down while using other joystick and button combinations, allows the player to perform different attacks/evasions utilizing the background or foreground.\\"War Gods.\\" Computer and Video Games. May 1996. p.12 To prevent situations where opponents end up on different playing fields for prolonged periods of time, each character has a teleport move which moves them close to their opponent. Just as in the Mortal Kombat games, players select a character and fight a series of opponents. War Gods also features combos which can be used through series of button presses. Like the Mortal Kombat games, the game has fatalities that are used to finish off opponents. Development Released by Midway as the first of its new 3D software prior to the release of Mortal Kombat 4, War Gods was developed by a team led by Joe Linhoff and George Petro. The arcade game utilized a hybrid of the hardware used for Cruis'n USA with a hard drive for data storage. All the moves were recorded using motion capture with just two actors. The in-game characters were created using a technology called \\"digital skin\\", which involved digitizing reference photographs of live actors and mapping them onto 3-D models. Developer credits include: Joe Linhoff (Project Lead, Systems Design), George Petro (Co-Lead, Game Play), Matt Booty (Systems / DCS2), Ed Keenan (Systems, DCS2), Jim Gentile (Art Direction, Character Design / Models), Jim Rohn (Lead Animator, Character Design), Dave Zabloudil (Background Designs, Models / Effects), Tom Brierton (Character Animation), Eric Kinkead (Additional Art), Vince Pontarelli (Music / Speech, Sound Effects), Jeff Morrow (Voice of Exor).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro8icXuBkP8#t=1195 War Gods was first unveiled at a trade show in March 1996. In response to suggestions and complaints about the gameplay, several months were devoted to refining the game's programming, delaying the arcade release to the third quarter of 1996. War Gods adopted Mortal Kombat's fighting style, but was created independently and never achieved the success of Mortal Kombat. The game boasted a \\"3D button\\" that lets fighters dive around the ring, in a circular arc, as part of their attacks and defensive moves. The orbiting camera smoothly follows the fighters, working to maintain the left/right \\"fighting line\\" needed for coherent two-player joystick control on the arcade cabinet. The Nintendo 64 version was delayed in order to tone down the difficulty level and add additional moves. A Panasonic M2 version of War Gods was in development and slated to be one of its launch titles, but it never happened due to the system's cancellation. Plot Many, many years ago, a spaceship carrying precious life-giving ore crashes to Earth. The chunks of ore scatter across the planet, and over the years, ten humans each find a stone of the ore, and are transformed into powerful beings, War Gods. And now, they are fighting each other to possess all the stones and become the ultimate super-warrior. To do this the player must beat the other 9 fighters, and a clone of the character the player has chosen, before going on to fight the sub-boss, Grox, and the main boss, Exor. =Characters= *Ahau Kin - an evil high priest who, after having a vision, sent his slaves to their death diving into his tribe's sacrificial well to reach the Ore, before retrieving the Ore himself. *Anubis - after uncovering a hidden burial chamber guarded by the Ore in the Valley of the Kings, his body was captured by the Ore and his soul was cursed to return as Anubis. *CY-5 - a cyborg from the future implanted with the Ore by scientists who are unaware of the Ore's true power, CY-5 seeks additional Ore to achieve greater human consciousness. *Kabuki Jo - a medieval samurai who seeks to master the power of the Ore after it causes him to slaughter his own men in a rage of fire and fury. *Maximus - a gladiator who killed his opponent in battle and his masters, escaping with the Ore and fighting for all who have been enslaved. *Pagan - a mistress of the black arts who finds the Ore, which increases her hunger for power and destruction. *Tak - a stone idol brought to life by the Ore as the avenger of a lost civilization. *Vallah - a warrior princess who stumbles upon a piece of the Ore while taking shelter during a storm; it transforms her into a Viking goddess who rules the realm of ice. Her physical likeness was portrayed by Kerri Hoskins, who portrayed Sonya Blade from early Mortal Kombat titles. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SphAlVqDndk&list;=PLZfaeGTZ03RUEZSap-17WtuvcULWq1zBI&index;=4 *Voodoo - an evil Caribbean witch doctor who is killed and thrown into a swamp containing some of the Ore, which brings him back to life as Voodoo, god of the undead. *Warhead - a former soldier who was the product of an explosion due to a failed attempt by the government to merge nuclear weapons with The Ore. His physical likeness was portrayed by Brian Glynn, the physical actor for Shao Kahn from early Mortal Kombat titles.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovX9F10t7k8&list;=PLZfaeGTZ03RUEZSap-17WtuvcULWq1zBI Reception The response to War Gods was lukewarm. One of the biggest criticisms the game received was for its cast of characters. Computer and Video Games reported that while the arcade game was being exhibited at the 1996 American Coin Machine Exposition, showgoers believed that the character designs would hurt the game's chances for success. Matt Casamassina of IGN called the character designs \\"uninspired\\", while a reviewer for Next Generation called them \\"mildly embarrassing Ringling Brothers' character design\\". Game Revolution, however, said the character designs were \\"pretty cool\\" and complimented the variety in the available fighters. The response to the game's graphics was mixed. Computer and Video Games had a positive impression of the in-game models with \\"digital skin\\". Next Generation said the digital skin technique is genuinely innovative and different, but the end result is characters which look jagged, move stiffly, and generally lack the smoothness of the polygonal fighters seen in contemporary games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Commenting on the Nintendo 64 version, Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot called it \\"probably the first N64 fighting game to hit the market that actually shows off some of the power of this system.\\" However, most reviewers said the game makes poor use of the N64 hardware, citing choppy character animations, a low frame rate, poorly detailed characters, and slowdown. Casamassina wrote that the while the digital skin textures were \\"initially nice\\", the \\"animation and terrible character design detract greatly from the whole experience.\\" IGN said they were \\"pleased with the control in the game, but not overly excited by it.\\" GamePro remarked that \\"The 3D button, while innovative, really doesn't enhance the gameplay\\" and is too easily confused with low guard on the N64 controller. Reviewers also commented that the game's controls were ill-suited for the N64 controller, though Next Generation contended that the controls are more intuitive with the N64 controller than they were in the arcade. The Nintendo 64 version was also criticized for having imbalanced A.I. Reviewers highlighted the fact that the game plays very similarly to the Mortal Kombat games. Gerstmann commented that there was \\"just enough of the MK feel to give it familiarity\\" calling it \\"an interesting footnote to the MK legacy.\\" After seeing the game demoed at the American Coin Machine Exposition, a Next Generation writer said it was \\"the next step forward for Midway's Mortal Kombat series (though it's not technically Mortal Kombat).\\" The magazine's later review of the game, however, criticized that too many of the fighters' moves are obvious parallels to moves seen in the Mortal Kombat series. Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) likewise judged that the overt similarity to Mortal Kombat makes the game \\"horribly unoriginal.\\" EGM named it the 1997 \\"Game That Should've Stayed in the Arcades\\" in their 1998 Video Game Buyer's Guide, commenting that \\"an average arcade game doesn't make for a great home game, War Gods is no exception.\\" Next Generation and Crispin Boyer of EGM noted that the Nintendo 64 version was actually enhanced over the arcade version, with faster gameplay, better anti-aliasing, and bosses which were tuned to present a more reasonable challenge, but both felt these enhancements were not enough to make the game good. GamePro assessed that the game compared unfavorably, not only to the top tier fighting games on the Saturn and PlayStation, but even to middling N64 fighters such as Killer Instinct Gold and Mortal Kombat Trilogy. War Gods flopped in arcades, owing chiefly to limited distribution and unfavorable word of mouth.

Opel Jahrbuch 2005, Brilon: Podszun (), 35 ff. The car was first presented in February at the 1935 Berlin Motor Show; production got under way later during that year. The Olympia was named in anticipation of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The pre- war Olympia was made in two versions: From 1935 to 1937 the Olympia had a 1.3-litre engine; for the OL38 version made from 1937 to 1940 this was replaced by a 1.5-litre overhead valve unit. Between 1935 and 1940, over 168,000 units were built. The car was also Opel's first post-war automobile when it re-entered production in 1947. This time it was built until 1953. The name Olympia was revived for a second time in 1967 for a luxury version of the Opel Kadett B. Opel Olympia (1935‚Äì1937) At 2500 Reichsmark it offered a true four-seater with 1.3-litre, four-cylinder, side-valve, 24 hp (18 kW) engine capable of 100 km/h (62 mph). Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox but a four-speed unit became available in 1937. The car had independent front suspension with a live axle at the rear and semi- elliptic leaf springs. This car was also assembled in Tanjung Priok, near Jakarta, in the then-Netherlands East Indies. Assembly there began in 1938 and the car was marketed as the \\"Opel 1.3\\". The car was made available in two versions, as a two-door saloon and as a two-door soft-top convertible: * LZ 2-door 5-window saloon, costing 2500 Reichsmark * CL 2-door 5-window cabriolet Opel Olympia OL38 (1937‚Äì1940, 1947‚Äì1949) Opel Olympia (1937), four-door saloon (rear view) A new engine was introduced in 1937 with a capacity of 1488 cc and overhead valves. It produced 37 PS (27 kW) and the top speed of the car was 112 km/h (70 mph). The car's body received a facelift. It was available in the same versions as its predecessor with the addition of the 6-light LV: * LZ 2-door 4-light saloon, 2675 Reichsmark * LV 4-door 6-light saloon, 2950 Reichsmark * CL 2-door 4-light cabriolet, 2750 Reichsmark Due to World War II, production came to a halt in late 1940. During the war, the Opel plant in R√ºsselsheim was severely damaged by allied bomb attacks. After reconstruction, production of the Olympia was announced in November 1947 and restarted the following month. Opel had been building the six-cylinder Blitz truck since July 1946; it would have made sense to restart production of the Kapit√§n before the Olympia, since it used the same engine. However, occupation regulations prohibited civilian sales of passenger cars of over 1.5 liters' displacement at the time. Externally, the OL 38 was unchanged to the pre-war car, but the fragile and complex Dubonnet front suspension was replaced by a more conventional control arm and coil spring one. Only the two-door sedan was produced. Until the end of 1949, 25,952 of these were made. Opel Olympia (1937), four-door saloon (front view) Opel Olympia 1950 (1950‚Äì1953) In January 1950 the Olympia got a modernized body, but the car was still based on the pre-war Olympia. One change was the seemingly retrograde change to a column-shifted three-sped manual from the floor-mounted four-speed used before.Ludvigsen, p. 61 The following bodies were offered: * 2-door saloon, 6400 Deutsche Mark * 2-door cabrio-coach, 6600 Deutsche Mark * 2-door kombi (estate), 7350 Deutsche Mark The kombi was built by . In February 1951, the Olympia was upgraded with more modern 15- rather than 16-inch wheels and a trunk compartment which enclosed the spare tyre. In just over three years of production (until March 1953), about 160,000 cars were made. Opel Olympia Berline (saloon/sedan) 1952 First successors: Opel Olympia Rekord (1953‚Äì57), later Opel Rekord (1957‚Äì86) In March 1953, the 18-year-old design of the Olympia was finally replaced by a completely new car, the Opel Olympia Rekord, with a modern pontoon body. Name revival: Opel Olympia (1967‚Äì1970) Opel Olympia A (1968) In August 1967 Opel revived the Olympia name with the new Olympia A. The name had last been used, until 1959, for a reduced specification version of the Opel Rekord, but now it was applied to a luxury derivative of the Opel Kadett B, readily distinguishable from the outside (at least in respect of the saloon/sedan version) by reason of its \\"black vinyl\\" roof-skin, together with the word \\"Olympia\\" appearing on the body sides behind the front wheels. Giving the Olympia its own name may have distanced it from the Kadett in the Opel showrooms and enabled the manufacturer to charge a premium price, but in other respects the new Olympia did not convincingly fill the gap in the range that had opened up between small family cars and big family cars, the Rekords having grown ever larger with each new generation.Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3), p. 213 The Olympia was available in saloon/sedan and coup√©-bodied versions. The saloon/sedan, available with 2 or 4 doors, shared the fast-back \\"Limousine\\" body of the \\"Kadett LS\\", while the Olympia coup√© used the same body as the \\"Kadett coup√© F\\". The Olympia was fitted with the \\"1100 SR\\" twin carburettor engine, and could also be ordered with any one of the three high-compression Camshaft in Head (CIH) engines also fitted in the Kadett and providing , or, in those export markets where the 1.5-litre version was available, . The Olympia A was withdrawn in August 1970, by when 80,637 had been produced.Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3), p. 216 The Olympia's demise cleared the way for the Opel Ascona, produced from August 1970 and introduced to the market in November 1970. The Ascona filled the gap between the smaller Kadett and the larger Rekord more obviously and, in terms of the sales figures, more persuasively than the Kadett-based Olympia, defining in the German auto-market a new mid-weight family car class where it would be joined by the Ford Taunus TC and, a couple of years later, by the Audi 80 and the Volkswagen Passat.Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3), pp. 244 & 251 The Olympia design did live on in a manner, as the front design was used on United States-bound Kadetts from the 1968 model year until replaced by the next generation, and on South African Opel Kadetts beginning with the 1971 model year.

The station is a major interchange point on the Brighton Main Line, measured from . It is managed by Southern, and is also served by Thameslink and GWR.  History  The local topography determined that it was cheaper to build and operate a railway line between London and Brighton which by-passed the parliamentary borough and long-established market town of Reigate and instead passed through the nearby Redstone or Red Hill gap in the Reigate Foreign (countryside) parish. According to the Acts of Parliament establishing railways between London and Brighton, and London and Dover, the line was to be shared between Croydon and Red Hill after which these two would deviate. The London and Brighton Railway (L&BR;) constructed the new line during 1840 and 1841, with the South Eastern Railway (SER) contributing half of the construction cost and taking ownership of the section between Croydon and Red Hill. (The SER had however been running services over the line since 1842.) The inevitable and continuing conflict between the two railway companies over the use of this joint line gave rise to the construction of four railway stations at the site of what was then a hamlet on the eastern side of Reigate. =Red Hill and Reigate Road (London & Brighton Railway) station= Red Hill and Reigate Road railway station in 1841. The original station was opened by the London and Brighton Railway on 12 July 1841 on a site to the south of the proposed junction with the South Eastern Main Line to Dover. The nearby market town was served by a horse-drawn omnibus service operated by the railway. This station was designed by the architect David Mocatta, and was one of a series of standardised modular buildings used by the railway. It closed on 15 April 1844, when the LBR began to share the SER Redhill and Reigate station and was demolished soon afterwards. =Redhill/Reigate (SER) stations= On 26 May 1842 the SER opened what was originally called 'Redhill', but later misleadingly renamed 'Reigate' station, on their own stretch of line just beyond the junction. Passengers transferring between the two railways did so at the old Merstham station further up the line. The SER wanted to replace their 'Reigate' station with a joint station immediately before the junction, but the L&BR; opposed the plan. As a result, the SER forced the issue by ending the arrangements at Merstham, thereby forcing passengers to transfer between the two stations at Redhill by foot. =Redhill and Reigate station= Redhill and Reigate station c.1853On 15 April 1844 the SER built a new station at the present site, named 'Redhill and Reigate' which was to be used by both railways as the interchange station. On the same day the two existing stations were closed. The branch line to Reigate was opened in 1849 with a new station called Reigate Town.Butt, R.V.J. (1995). The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford, , p. 196. Nevertheless, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (the successor of the L&BR;) continued to operate the omnibus service for its own passengers.Eborall, C.W. & Smiles, S. (1863). Report of the General Manager and Secretary on the relations of the South Eastern and Brighton Companies, McCorqudale & Co. [for the South Eastern Railway], p. 3. =Redhill Junction station= A 1905 Railway Clearing House junction diagram, including the two lines between Purley and Redhill (original line of 1841 in pink; \\"Quarry Line\\" of 1899 in green) The SER 'Redhill and Reigate' station was rebuilt and enlarged on the same site in August 1858 when it was renamed 'Redhill Junction'. The chronic congestion at the station was however eased after 1 May 1868 when Redhill ceased to be on the South Eastern Main Line to Dover following the opening of the 'Sevenoaks cut off' line between St Johns and Tonbridge railway station.H.P. White, A regional history of the railways of Great Britain. Vol. 2 Southern England, Phoenix House, 1961 p. 44. A ten-year agreement between the SER and the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR the successor to the L&BR; after July 1846) over the use of the station and lines to Coulsdon was signed 1 February 1869 and renewed ten years later.Turner, (1977) pp. 112‚Äì3. However, during the 1880s, as traffic increased the disputes over the use of line and Redhill station re- occurred. This became known as the 'Southern Lines Controversy' and ultimately led to the construction of the Quarry Line by the LB&SCR; in 1899, which avoided Redhill. The LB&SCR; diverted many of its Brighton main line trains to the new line, but retained running powers over the original line and the use of Redhill station. These were continued until both the SER and the LBSCR came under the ownership of the Southern Railway 1 January 1923 and the name of the joint station was changed to Redhill in July 1929. =Electrification= The Brighton main line and the line from Redhill to Reigate were both electrified under the Southern Railway in 1 January 1933. The Redhill to Tonbridge Line was electrified under British Rail in 1993. View northward from the Down platform in 1955  Description  Redhill station is at the junction of the Brighton Main Line, which runs north to London and south to Gatwick Airport and Brighton, with the ex-SER North Downs Line, which runs west to Guildford and Reading, and the Redhill to Tonbridge Line, to the east. Platforms 1a/1b (far side) and 2a/2b at Redhill, with the through lines and the edge of Platform 3 visible. The disused parcels bridge is in the background. Platform 0 was not yet built when this photo was taken. The station has four passenger platforms and a parcels bay (which is now out of use). From west to east: platform 0 is the most recently built (which accounts for its unusual numbering) and serves destinations including Bedford, Reading, London Victoria and Reigate; platforms 1 and 2 are an island; there are two through lines between platforms 2 and 3; platform 3 and the old parcels dock are on the eastern side with a secondary entrance/exit. All passenger platforms are of 12 car length, and all are subdivided into 'a' (north end) and 'b' (south end). Platform 1 is a bay platform with no northbound access; otherwise all platforms have access to all routes. There is no access from either through line to or from the North Downs Line - all traffic from this direction must pass through a platform. Platforms are linked by a subway, and by an out-of use parcels/staff bridge. There are lifts from the platforms to the subway and a level entrance from the Platform 3 exit, with a further lift between the subway and the main entrance, which is at street level. The main entrance faces the town centre, and is opposite Redhill bus station. The ticket office is staffed and also has ticket machines, and there are ticket barriers. There is a coffee shop in the ticket hall, and a takeaway-only coffee shop on platforms 1 and 2.  Services  First Great Western 166204 arrives with a Reading-Redhill stopping service on 17 March 2007. The sidings furthest from the platform have since been replaced by platform 0. 2018 Layout looking southwards with the new Platform 0 to the right Trains at Redhill are provided by Southern, Thameslink, Great Western Railway. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: Southern * 2 tph to London Victoria * 2 tph to * 1 tph to Thameslink * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to * 2 tph to via Gatwick Airport Great Western Railway * 2 tph to via (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping) * 1 tph to Gatwick Airport There are also varying freight services, mostly consisting of stone trains to Crawley or Ardingly, and engineering workings to and from Tonbridge Yard.  Oyster extension  On 11 January 2016, payment using Oyster and contactless payment cards was introduced at Redhill, as part of the Oyster extension from Merstham to Gatwick Airport. The station is outside of the London Fare Zone area, and special fares apply. Motive power depot Class 166 First Great Western service to Reading at platform 1 as Third rail electrification is not installed on all of the North Downs Line. Platform 0 was not yet built when this photo was taken. An engine shed, turntable and locomotive coaling and servicing facilities were installed by the South Eastern Railway in 1855 in the area between the Brighton and Tonbridge lines. These facilities were rebuilt by the Southern Railway in 1924 and lasted until the end of steam in the area in 1965.Hawkins, Chris and Reeves, George. (1979). An historical survey of Southern sheds, Oxford Publishing Co., , p. 70. The site of the depot remained in use as a stabling point for many years after this. Further sidings to the west and south-west of platform 1 were removed during the construction of platform 0 in 2016‚Äì17.

SolO is intended to perform detailed measurements of the inner heliosphere and nascent solar wind, and perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from Earth, both serving to answer the question \\"How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere?\\" SolO makes observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ‚âà60 solar radii (RS), or 0.284 astronomical units (au), placing it inside Mercury's perihelion of 0.3075 au. During the mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 24¬∞. The total mission cost is US$1.5 billion, counting both ESA and NASA contributions.https://spacenews.com/atlas-launches-solar-orbiter-mission/ - 11 February 2020 SolO was launched on 10 February 2020. The mission is planned to last 7 years. A comparison of the size of the Sun as seen from Earth (left, 1 au) and from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft (0.284 au, right). The Solar Orbiter structural thermal model shortly before leaving the Airbus Defence and Space facility in Stevenage, UK. Spacecraft The Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion. The spacecraft provides a stable platform to accommodate the combination of remote-sensing and in situ instrumentation in an electromagnetically clean environment. The 21 sensors were configured on the spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in situ or remote-sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from the BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). The solar arrays can be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun. A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys. The Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth in X-band. The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-Gain Antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and now function as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable Medium- and High-Gain Antennas are in use. The High-Temperature High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient volumes of data. Its design was adapted from the BepiColombo mission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to Earth at the earliest possible opportunity. The ground station at Malarg√ºe (Argentina), with a 35-m antenna, is used for 4 to 8 hours/day (effective). ESA's Malarg√ºe ground station will be used for all operations throughout the mission with the ground stations in New Norcia, Australia, and Cebreros, Spain, acting as backup when necessary. Mission operations During nominal science operations, science data is downlinked for eight hours during each communication period with the ground station. Additional eight-hour downlink passes are scheduled as needed to reach the required total science data return of the mission. The Solar Orbiter ground segment makes maximum reuse of ESA's infrastructure for Deep Space missions: * The ground stations, which belong to ESA's space tracking station network (ESTRACK) * The Mission Operations Centre (MOC), located at ESOC, Darmstadt, Germany * The Science Operations Centre (SOC), located at ESAC, Villanueva de la Ca√±ada, Spain * The communications network, linking the various remotely located centres and stations to support the operational data traffic The Science Operations Centre was responsible for mission planning and the generation of payload operations requests to the MOC, as well as science data archiving. The SOC has been operational for the active science phase of the mission, i.e. from the beginning of the Cruise Phase onwards. The handover of payload operations from the MOC to the SOC is performed at the end of the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). ESA's Malarg√ºe Station in Argentina will be used for all operations throughout the mission, with the ground stations of New Norcia Station, Australia, and Cebreros Station, Spain, acting as backup when necessary. During the initial cruise phase, which lasts until November 2021, Solar Orbiter will perform two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft's trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System. At the same time, Solar Orbiter will acquire in situ data and characterise and calibrate its remote- sensing instruments. The first close solar pass will take place in 2022 at around a third of Earth's distance from the Sun. The spacecraft's orbit has been chosen to be 'in resonance' with Venus, which means that it will return to the planet's vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet's gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. Initially, Solar Orbiter will be confined to the same plane as the planets, but each encounter of Venus will increase its orbital inclination. For example, after the 2025 Venus encounter, it will make its first solar pass at 17¬∞ inclination, increasing to 33¬∞ during a proposed mission extension phase, bringing even more of the polar regions into direct view. Scientific objectives The spacecraft makes a close approach to the Sun every six months.https://www.esa.int/ScienceExploration/SpaceScience/SolarOrbiter/SolarOrbiterfactsheet - 10 February 2020 The closest approach will be positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere. Solar Orbiter will be able to observe the magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerful solar flares or eruptions. Researchers will also have the chance to coordinate observations with NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission (2018-2025) which is performing measurements of the Sun's extended corona. The objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its inner heliosphere. The new understanding will help answer these questions: * How and where do the solar wind plasma and magnetic field originate in the corona? * How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability? * How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere? * How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? Instruments The science payload is composed of 10 instruments: ; ;Heliospheric in-situ instruments (4) * SWA - Solar Wind Plasma Analyser (United Kingdom): Consists of a suite of sensors that measures the ion and electron bulk properties (including density, velocity, and temperature) of the solar wind, thereby characterizing the solar wind between 0.28 and 1.4 au from the Sun. In addition to determining the bulk properties of the wind, SWA provides measurements of solar wind ion composition for key elements (e.g. the C, N, O group and Fe, Si or Mg)https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/51217-instruments - 22 January 2020 - 10 February 2020 * EPD - Energetic Particle Detector (Spain): Measures the composition, timing and distribution functions of suprathermal and energetic particles. Scientific topics to be addressed include the sources, acceleration mechanisms, and transport processes of these particleshttps://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/51217-instruments - Update 22 January 2020 * MAG - Magnetometer (United Kingdom): Provides in situ measurements of the heliospheric magnetic field with high precision. This will facilitate detailed studies into the way the Sun's magnetic field links into space and evolves over the solar cycle; how particles are accelerated and propagate around the Solar System, including to the Earth; how the corona and solar wind are heated and accelerated * RPW - Radio and Plasma Waves (France): Unique amongst the Solar Orbiter instruments, RPW makes both in situ and remote-sensing measurements. RPW measures magnetic and electric fields at high time resolution using a number of sensors/antennas, to determine the characteristics of electromagnetic and electrostatic waves in the solar wind ; ;Solar remote-sensing instruments (6) * PHI - Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (Germany): Provides high-resolution and full-disk measurements of the photospheric vector magnetic field and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity as well as the continuum intensity in the visible wavelength range. The LOS velocity maps have the accuracy and stability to allow detailed helioseismic investigations of the solar interior, in particular of the solar convection zone high- resolution and full-disk measurements of the photospheric magnetic field * EUI - Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (Belgium): Images the solar atmospheric layers above the photosphere, thereby providing an indispensable link between the solar surface and outer corona that ultimately shapes the characteristics of the interplanetary medium. Also, EUI provides the first-ever UV images of the Sun from an out-of-ecliptic viewpoint (up to 33¬∞ of solar latitude during the extended mission phase) * SPICE - Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (France): Performs extreme ultraviolet imaging spectroscopy to remotely characterize plasma properties of the Sun's on-disk corona. This will enable matching in situ composition signatures of solar wind streams to their source regions on the Sun's surfacehttps://web.archive.org/web/20110511231002/http://www.mps.mpg.de/en/projekte/solar- orbiter/spice/}} * STIX - Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (Switzerland): Provides imaging spectroscopy of solar thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission from 4 to 150 keV. STIX provides quantitative information on the timing, location, intensity, and spectra of accelerated electrons as well as of high-temperature thermal plasmas, mostly associated with flares and/or microflares *Metis \\\\- Coronagraph (Italy): Simultaneously images the visible and far ultraviolet emissions of the solar corona and diagnoses, with unprecedented temporal coverage and spatial resolution, the structure and dynamics of the full corona in the range from 1.4 to 3.0 (from 1.7 to 4.1) solar radii from Sun centre, at minimum (maximum) perihelion during the nominal mission. This is a region that is crucial in linking the solar atmospheric phenomena to their evolution in the inner heliosphere * SoloHI - Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (United States): Images both the quasi- steady flow and transient disturbances in the solar wind over a wide field of view by observing visible sunlight scattered by solar wind electrons. SoloHI provides unique measurements to pinpoint coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

From 1722 until his death Trenchard was also a member of Parliament for Taunton. He died on 17 December 1723. Works As he inherited considerable wealth, Trenchard was able to devote the greater part of his life to writing on political subjects, his approach being that of a Whig and an opponent of the High Church party. With Walter Moyle he wrote An Argument, Shewing that a Standing Army is Inconsistent with a Free Government (1697) and A Short History of Standing Armies in England (1698 and 1731). He developed anticlerical lines of argument in The Natural History of Superstition (1709), and The Independent Whig, a weekly periodical published in 1720‚Äì21 with Thomas Gordon.The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought, ed. Mark Goldie & Robert Wokler, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 780 From 1720 to 1723, Trenchard, again with Thomas Gordon, wrote a series of 144 weekly essays entitled Cato's Letters, condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny. The essays were published as Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious, first in the London Journal and then in the British Journal. These essays became a cornerstone of the Commonwealthmen tradition.

Displaying the arms of Trenchard impaling Speke Sir John Trenchard (30 March 1649 ‚Äì 27 April 1695) was an English politician and landowner. Life He belonged to an old Dorset family. He was born on 30 March 1649 at Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, to Thomas Trenchard of Wolverton (1615‚Äì1671), and his wife Hannah n√©e Henley (d. 1691). His grandfather was Sir Thomas Trenchard of Wolverton (1582‚Äì1657), who was knighted by James I in 1613. He was educated at Winchester (1661-1665) and at New College, Oxford (1665-1667). In 1667, he entered the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1674. John Trenchard entered parliament as member for Taunton in 1679. He associated himself with those who proposed to exclude the Duke of York from the throne, and attended some of the meetings held by these malcontents. It is possible he was concerned in the Rye House Plot. In fact, he was arrested at all of the events in July 1683, but no definite evidence was brought against him so he was released. When Monmouth landed in the west of England in June 1685, Trenchard fled from England to Groningen, Netherlands.IGI: Baptism of Maria Trenchard to John and Philippa on 18 Mar 1687 at Nederlands Hervormde Kerk, Groningen, Netherlands Around 1687-1688, he was pardoned through the good offices of William Penn, and able to return home. Again he entered parliament, but he took no active part in the Revolution of 1688, although he managed to secure the good will of William III. On 29 October 1689, he was knighted by the king, and made Chief Justice of Chester. In 1692, he was appointed Secretary of State. He and the government incurred much ridicule through their failure to prove the existence of a great Jacobite plot in Lancashire and Cheshire in which they had been led to believe. Family On 10 November 1682, he married: Philippa Speke (1664‚Äì1743), daughter of George Speke of White Lackington, Somerset, with 4 sons and 3 daughters including: # George Trenchard (d. 1758) # Maria Trenchard (1687-) # William Trenchard (12 October 1694-) Sir John died on 27 April 1695 at Kensington, London, and is buried at Bloxworth, Dorset.

Mapping and Modelling Landscape Ecosystems. Canberra: The Murray-Darling Basin Commission It aims to aid ecological restoration, the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Humans use ecosynthesis to make environments more suitable for life, through restoration ecology (introduced species, vegetation mapping, habitat enhancement, remediation and mitigation.) Holmgren, David (2002) Permaculture. Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability. Hepburn, Victoria: Holmgren Design Services. Restoration ecology Ecological restoration aims to recreate, initiate, or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.K. J. Vaughn Restoration Ecology, (2010) Revegetation: the establishment of vegetation on sites where it has been previously lost, often with erosion control as the primary goal. Habitat enhancement: the process of increasing the suitability of a site as habitat for some desired species. Remediation: improving an existing ecosystem or creating a new one with the aim of replacing another that has deteriorated or been destroyed. Mitigation: legally mandated remediation for loss of protected species or an ecosystem. Through restoration ecology, humans can help ecosystems that we have either caused harm to or disturbed be brought back to functional state. Trophic cascade Gray wolf in YellowStone National Park A clear example of humans ecosynthesiszing would be through the introduction of a species to cause a trophic cascade, which is the result of indirect effects between nonadjacent trophic levels in a food chain or food web, such as the top predator in a food chain and a plant.Christina Eisenberg, (2010), The wolf's tooth : keystone predators, trophic cascades, and biodiversity, The most famous example of a trophic cascade is that of the introduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, which had extradionary effects to the ecosystem. Yellowstone had a massive population of elk because they had no predators, which caused the local aspen population and other vegetation to significantly decrease in population size. However, the introduction of wolves controlled the elk population and indirectly affected the aspen and other vegetation, bringing the ecosystem back to sustainability.C. A. White, .. C. Feller, S.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 9, 2003. In the episode, Homer sues the church and ends up receiving the deed to own it. Under his ownership, the church becomes a hangout for townspeople. Plot At a WNBA game which the Simpson family are attending, the announcer offers a $50,000 prize for successfully shooting a half-court basket. Ned Flanders kneels and prays before shooting the basket, and makes it. He declares he will donate the money, much to Homer's dismay. The following day, Homer asks Ned what his secret is, and Ned replies it is hard work, clean living, and prayer; since the first two would require effort on his part, Homer focuses on prayer. Later, Homer could not find the remote control and prays to God to help him find it. He finds it under the couch and sees that his prayers are working. After noticing his excessive praying, Marge tells Homer that he should not ask God to do everything for him, which he bluntly refuses to consider. On a Sunday, Homer is walking towards the church and looking up, talking to God. Not looking where he is going, he falls into a shallow hole. A lawyer convinces Homer to sue the church. In court, the jury finds in Homer's favor and he receives the deed to the church. Despite Marge's objections, he moves the family there, displeasing Reverend Lovejoy, who eventually leaves town. The church becomes a bar and hangout for the townspeople, and Ned observes that they have violated all Ten Commandments. As Marge worries that Homer is incurring God's wrath, a rainstorm begins and Homer is struck by lightning in the mouth (God's way of smiting him for his blasphemy, sacrilege and heresy). The town begins to flood, and the townspeople flee to the roof of the church. Just as the townspeople are about to enact revenge on Homer, Reverend Lovejoy returns in a helicopter and leads everyone in prayer, asking God to forgive them. The flood subsides, and afterwards Lisa gives logical reasons for the cause of the events that had happened, with the storm and flood caused by bonfire and trees being cut down, but when questioned about why the rain suddenly stopped, Lisa just says \\"I don't know. Buddha?\\". The camera then pans to God, Buddha and Colonel Sanders watching from Heaven, rationalizing that the humans have suffered enough. Production The show has delved into religious themes many times in its history. In this episode, the theme of prayer is given center stage. The episode had a freelance pitch. O'Neal and Boushell wanted to ensure they came up with a unique idea that had never been done before, as they knew the episode was near the show's 300th anniversary. The original pitch was based on an NPR story about the \\"gospel of prosperity\\".The Simpsons staff (2003). Commentary for \\"Pray Anything\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. This episode opens with a WNBA game because many NBA players had turned them down for a guest spot a couple of years before in the episode \\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\".Jean, Al (2003).

Commentary for \\"Pray Anything\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Al Jean explained that a valid point made in the episode was why God should care about the average man's first world problems when there are natural and man-made disasters that could use his help. Castellaneta did a longer falling noise at the table read than the one that appeared in the final cut of the episode. Jean explained that due to the loss of Phil Hartman ‚Äì and therefore Lionel Hutz ‚Äì it was tough to introduce new lawyers to the show. This episode includes one such attempt. The staff had a fight with the broadcast standards over Homer dancing around the church in his underwear. In regard to the sunset shot, up until this point in the show's history, there was not much graduated shading used because it had to be painstakingly drawn. In contrast, it is very quick and easy using computers, which is why Polcino prefers digital over the hand painted; many more color and shading options are made available. Reception The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the thirteenth best episode of the show with a sports theme. Bringing in the Sheaves is hummed by Homer Simpson, and I Was Made for Lovin' You by Kiss is played in the background.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701199/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd Polcino said Pray Anything was a \\"well-written show\\", and \\"one of his favourite scripts\\" as he loves addressing religious themes.

The museum was founded, and first opened to the public, in the early 1980s. The museum is the largest independent air museum in Britain. It is also the only Allied Air Forces Memorial in Europe and has established branches in Canada and France and the support of over 4,000 registered \\"friends\\" across the world. The museum is a Corporate Member of Friends of the Few (Battle of Britain Memorial) and the Royal Aeronautical Society. The Museum's principal activity is in education and the history of flight, through which it is involved with aerospace manufacturers and organisations via its long term \\"Reach for the Sky\\" project. This delivered the first KS2 History of Aviation educational resource book to all 26,000 primary schools in UK, supported by RAeS and the Ministry of Transport. History The parkland site includes buildings and hangars, some of which are listed. It incorporates a managed environment area and a DEFRA and Environment Agency supported self sustainability project called \\"Nature of Flight\\". The museum is situated next to a 10,000 ft runway, which is privately owned. Whilst the Royal Air Force carried on using the runway for aircraft landing and take off training until 1992, the buildings and hangars had long been abandoned. In 1983, a group started clearing the undergrowth and the site was ready to be unveiled as the Yorkshire Air Museum in 1986. Events The Museum undertakes several annual events each year within the general attraction / entertainment area as well as educational / academic events for specific audiences, plus several corporate events in association with companies such as Bentley, Porsche, banking, government agencies etc. The unique annual Allied Air Forces Memorial Day takes place in September. Exhibits The Museum has 49 aircraft spanning the development of aviation from 1853 up to the latest GR4 Tornado. Several aircraft including Victor, Nimrod, Buccaneer, Sea Devon, SE5a, Eastchurch Kitten; DC3 Dakota; are kept live and operated on special \\"Thunder Days\\" during the year. Over 20 historic vehicles and a Registered Archive containing over 500,000 historic artefacts and documents are also preserved at the Museum, which is also the Official Archive for the National Aircrew Association and National Air Gunners Association. It is nationally registered and accredited through DCMS/Arts Council England and is a registered charity.

The Latin name means literally \\"more human literature\\" and was in contrast to the other main field of study when the university began, i.e. res divinae (or lit. div.), also known as theology. Lit. hum. is concerned with human learning, and lit. div. with learning that came from God. In its early days, it encompassed mathematics and natural sciences as well. It is an archetypal humanities course. Lit. hum. at Oxford The University of Oxford's classics course, also known as greats, is divided into two parts, lasting five terms and seven terms respectively, the whole lasting four years in total, which is one year more than most arts degrees at Oxford and other English universities. The course of studies leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on first hand study of primary sources in the original Greek or Latin. In the first part (honour moderations or mods) students concentrate on Latin and/or Greek language; in the second part students choose eight papers from the disciplines of classical literature, Greek and Roman history, Philosophy, Archaeology, and Linguistics. The teaching style is very traditional and consists of weekly tutorials in each of the two main subjects chosen, supplemented by a wide variety of lectures. The main teaching mechanism remains the weekly essay, one on each of the two main chosen subjects, typically written to be read out at a one-to-one tutorial; this affords all students plenty of practice at writing short, clear, and well- researched papers. Changed in the late 20th century, a strong emphasis remains on study of original texts in Latin and Greek, assessed by prepared translation and by gobbet (a short commentary on an assigned primary source). In a typical \\"text\\" paper candidates will be expected first to translate into English three or four long passages selected by the examiners from the set books; and secondly to comment on each of an extended set of short paragraphs or sentences from the same set texts; marks are awarded for recognising the context and the significance of each excerpt. =Mods= The mods (moderations ‚Äì exams conducted by moderators) course runs for the first five terms of the course. The traditional aim was for students to develop their ability to read fluently in Latin and Greek. The works of Virgil and the two Homeric epics were compulsory, and other works had to be chosen from a given list. There were also unseen translations from both languages, and compulsory translation into prose, and voluntary into verse, in both languages. The course has now changed to reflect the continuing decline in the numbers of applicants who have had the opportunity to study Greek and Latin at school. Since the early 1970s, it has been possible to begin learning Greek during the preparation for mods (an option originally called mods-B, the brainchild of John G. Griffiths of Jesus). More recently, due to the omission of Latin and Greek from the National Curriculum since 1988, options have been added for those also without Latin. There are now five alternative paths through mods. * Students with both Latin and Greek at A-level or equivalent take the traditional route, Mods IA. * Those with one such language do mods IB (Latin plus beginners' Greek) or mods IC (Greek plus beginners' Latin). * Students with a strong aptitude for languages who have not learned Latin or Greek can take either mods IIA (beginners' Latin only) or mods IIB (beginners' Greek only). Language tuition is now organized centrally within the university by the Faculty of Classics; this leaves the colleges free to concentrate on teaching classical literature/rhetoric, history and philosophy. The mods examination has a reputation as something of an ordeal: it evolved in the 21st century from 11 or 12 three-hour papers across seven consecutive days into 10 or 11 three-hour papers across seven or eight days. Candidates for classical mods thus still face a much larger number of exams than undergraduates reading for most other degrees at Oxford sit for their mods, prelims or even, in many cases, finals. Students who successfully pass mods may then go on to study the full greats course in their remaining seven terms. Those choosing the 'Course II' version are expected to read as many of their finals texts in the original of their chosen language as those on Course I; there is, moreover, the option of studying the second classical language as two papers at finals. =Greats= The traditional greats course consisted of Greek and Roman history on the one hand, and philosophy on the other. The philosophy included Plato and Aristotle, and also modern philosophy, both logic and ethics, with a critical reading of standard texts. In 1968 an elective 'Latin and Greek Literature' was added; students chose two of the three. Since then, various combined courses have also been developed including: *Classics and modern languages; *Ancient and modern history; and *Classical archaeology and ancient history. In 2004 the full lit. hum. course was revised; students examined since 2008 now choose eight papers from a wide range of subject areas: * Ancient history ‚Äî \\"period\\" papers ranging from the pre-history of Greece to the first Flavian emperors in Rome; or \\"topic\\" papers, on such subjects as Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World or Athenian democracy. * Philosophy ‚Äî from Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics to more modern philosophers, such as Kant and Wittgenstein * Ancient literature ‚Äî including \\"core\\" papers on mainstream Greek and Latin texts, plus various individual authors and other topics * Philology (classical linguistics) ‚Äî including such papers as 'Greek from Linear B to the Koine', 'Oscan & Umbrian' and 'General Linguistics and Comparative Philology' * Classical art and archaeology from vases to buildings * Second classical language ‚Äî for those who only offered one language at mods * Optional special thesis as a ninth paper; theses can be offered within each of the first five options The regulations governing the combinations of papers are moderately simple: students must take at least four papers based on the study of ancient texts in the original Latin or Greek; otherwise they can choose what they want, provided only that if they offer literature papers, they must offer the appropriate \\"core\\" papers too, and if they choose to offer \\"period\\" papers in history then they must offer one of the approved combinations. In the past it was compulsory also to offer papers in unprepared translation from Latin and Greek into English; these papers counted \\"below the line\\" ‚Äî candidates were required to pass them, but they did not otherwise affect the overall class of the degree. This requirement has now been dropped, and it is possible to pass greats without offering any unprepared translation papers. The formerly optional prose and verse composition papers (English into Latin and Greek) have been removed from the greats syllabus entirely. Distinguished graduates in mods and greats * G. E. M.

Ishii led the development and application of biological weapons at Unit 731 in Manchukuo during the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, including the bubonic plague attacks at Chinese cities of Changde and Ningbo, and planned the Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night biological attack against the United States. Ishii and Unit 731 engaged in forced human experimentation on civilians and prisoners of war that resulted in the death of over 10,000 people, and were responsible for some of the most notorious war crimes of Imperial Japan during the Pacific War. Ishii and Unit 731 were granted immunity in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East by the United States in exchange for information and research for the U.S. biological warfare program. Biography =Early years= Shir≈ç Ishii was born on 15 June 1892 in Shibayama in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the fourth son of Katsuya Ishii, a local landowner and sake maker. Ishii attended the Chiba Imperial School in Chiba City and the Fourth High School in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture before studying medicine at Kyoto Imperial University. In 1921, Ishii was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army as a military surgeon with the rank of Army Surgeon, Second Class (surgeon lieutenant). In 1922, Ishii was assigned to the 1st Army Hospital and Army Medical School in Tokyo, where his work impressed his superiors enough to gain him post-graduate medical schooling at Kyoto Imperial University two years later. During his studies, Ishii would often grow bacteria \\"pets\\" in multiple petri dishes, and his odd practice of raising bacteria as companions rather than as research subjects made him notable to the staff of the university. In 1925, Ishii was promoted to Army Surgeon, First Class (surgeon captain). =Biological warfare project= By 1927, Ishii was advocating for the creation of a Japanese bio- weapons program, and in 1928 began a two-year tour of the West where he did extensive research on the effects of biological warfare and chemical warfare developments from World War I onwards. Ishii's travels were highly successful and helped win him the patronage of Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of the Army. Ishii also received the backing of Araki's ideological rival in the army, Major-General Tetsuzan Nagata, who was later considered Ishii's \\"most active supporter\\" at the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials. In January 1931, Ishii received promotion to Senior Army Surgeon, Third Class (surgeon major). In 1935, Ishii was promoted to Senior Army Surgeon, Second Class (surgeon lieutenant-colonel). On August 1, 1936, Ishii would be given formal control over Unit 731 and its research facilities. In these facilities Ishii and his men would perform heinous experiments on the living, including but not limited to, breeding of plague rats and subsequent infection of living subjects, forced pregnancies, inducing frostbite by inducing and trying to cure it without anesthetics, and open vivisections on fully aware subjects with little to no pain medication. Towards the end of the war Ishii would develop a plan to spread plague fleas along the populated west coast of the US, known as Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night. This plan was not realized due to the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945. Ishii and the Japanese government attempted to cover up the facilities and experiments, but ultimately failed with their secret university lab in Tokyo and their main lab in Harbin, China. The Japanese Army's Unit 731 War Crimes Exhibition Hall (731ÁΩ™ËØÅÈôàÂàóÈ¶Ü) in Harbin stands to this day as a museum to the unit and the atrocities they committed. =War crime immunity= Ishii was arrested by United States authorities during the Occupation of Japan at the end of World War II and, along with other leaders, was supposed to be thoroughly interrogated by Soviet authorities. Instead, Ishii and his team managed to negotiate and receive immunity in 1946 from Japanese war-crimes prosecution before the Tokyo tribunal in exchange for their full disclosure. Although the Soviet authorities wished the prosecutions to take place, the United States objected after the reports of the investigating US microbiologists. Among these was Dr. Edwin Hill, the Chief of Fort Detrick, whose report stated that the information was \\"absolutely invaluable;\\" it \\"could never have been obtained in the United States because of scruples attached to experiments on humans,\\" and \\"the information was obtained fairly cheaply.\\" On 6 May 1947, Douglas MacArthur wrote to Washington D.C. that \\"additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as 'War Crimes' evidence.\\" Ishii's immunity deal was concluded in 1948 and he was never prosecuted for any war crimes, and his exact whereabouts or occupation were unknown from 1947. Richard Drayton, a Cambridge University history lecturer, claimed that Ishii later went to Maryland to advise on bioweapons. Another source says he stayed in Japan, where he opened a clinic where he did examinations and treatments for free. Ishii kept a diary but it did not make reference to any of his wartime activity with Unit 731. =Death= Ishii died on 9 October 1959 from laryngeal cancer at the age of 67 at a hospital in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Ishii's funeral was chaired by Masaji Kitano, his second-in-command at Unit 731. According to his daughter, Ishii converted to Catholicism shortly before his death.

Biography He was born in Bel√©m, Lisbon, into a modest family. He later changed his family name from Esp√≠rito Santo to the more aristocratic Sequeira. He studied art first at the academy of Lisbon, before moving to Rome, where he was Antonio Cavallucci\`s pupil. By the age of thirteen, he had evinced such marked talent that F. de Setubal employed him as an assistant in his work for the Jo√£o Ferreiras Palace. Sequeira resided in Rome from 1788 to 1794, when he was made honorary member of the Academy of St Luke. After another two years and further study in Italy, he returned to his native country with such a great reputation that important commissions for churches and palaces were immediately entrusted to him: scriptural subjects, large historical compositions and cabinet pictures. In 1802, he was appointed first court painter and, in this role, executed many works for the prince regent, for Dona Maria Teresa, and for members of the court. He designed the valuable silver service which was presented by the Portuguese nation to Wellington, and a monument that was erected in 1820 in the Rossio square at Lisbon. In 1823, he visited Paris where he is known to have tried his skill in lithography and etching. In 1825, he painted the \\"Death of Cam√µes\\", which was considered by many to be the first proto-romantic or romantic Portuguese painting. The last years of his life he spent in Rome, devoting himself chiefly to devotional subjects and to his duties as head of the Portuguese Academy. He saw a Turner exposition in the late 1820s, that served as inspiration for some of his best paintings, like the \\"Adora√ß√£o dos Magos\\" (1828). He died in Rome in 1837. Works Among his best-known pictures are the Miracle of Ourique, Prince John Reviewing the Troops at Azumbuja, and The Adoration of the Magi. Numerous paintings by Sequeira are held at the Mafra National Palace, the Ajuda National Palace, and in the principal palaces and churches of Lisbon. The Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (National Museum of Ancient Art), in Lisbon, has one of the best collections of his paintings.

The Greystone campus, located on State Route 29/128 in St. Helena, California, offers associate degrees and two certificate programs in culinary arts and baking and pastry arts. The CIA at Greystone and the Culinary Institute of America at Copia make up the school's California branch. The campus' primary facility is a stone building, known as Greystone Cellars and built for William Bowers Bourn II as a cooperative wine cellar in 1889. Hamden McIntyre designed the gravity flow winery along with other wineries of the decade. The building changed ownership several times, and was notably owned by the Christian Brothers as a winery from 1945 to 1989. It was used as a winery until its sale to the school in 1993, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History =Establishment of Greystone Cellars= Greystone Cellars in 1889 The Greystone campus is situated in and around the Greystone Cellars building, which William Bowers Bourn II conceived as a business concept. His father, William Bowers Bourn Sr., was wealthy from ownership of the Empire Mine gold mine, as well as co-ownership of a shipping company. Bourn II was a businessman with business interests and residences around California, although he had spent his summers during his youth at White Sulphur Springs Resort in St. Helena, before his parents bought Madro√±o, an estate in the town. Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were purchasing wine from Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus were able to purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; he was in his early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the fa√ßades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A large number of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The cornerstone was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, a copy of a St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars. The building cost $250,000 ($ in ). At its completion, architect George Percy described Greystone Cellars as the largest wine cellar in California, if not the world. Greystone was also the first California winery to be operated and illuminated by electricity, produced by a boiler and gas generator located in a mechanical room below the building's central front wing. In the spring of 1894, a long-lasting phylloxera scourge made Bourn decide the winery was no longer profitable. The former Carpy residence =Subsequent uses= Greystone from its farms at the Charles Krug Winery He sold the building at a low price that year, to Charles Carpy, who deeded the property to the California Wine Association. The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia brothers of San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced sacramental wine under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of the winery. The house burned down around 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school. In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, purchasing it in 1945, and using it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, and the costs of seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable. =Culinary Institute campus= In 1993, Heublein sold the property at about 10 percent of its $14 million ($ in ) valuation, $1.68 million ($ in ), to the Culinary Institute of America, which used $15 million ($ in ) to renovate the building and give it a seismic retrofit. After completing the work in August 1995, the school established the property as a branch campus. After initially offering certificate courses, in autumn 2006, the campus began offering associate degrees. In 2015, the college put in motion plans to purchase a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa that operated from 2001 to 2008. The college intends to open a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which will house the CIA's new Food Business School. The school, which was outgrowing the Greystone campus, purchased the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million (it was recently assessed for $21.3 million). Architecture alt=Interior of a large building with a staircase and elevator The Greystone Cellars building stands on a terraced hillside site on the west side of 29/128, about a mile north of St. Helena's central business district. It has , three stories, and a basement, and is around long, wide, and tall, with thick walls. As a wine cellar, it held 3.5 million gallons. The building was designed in the Richardson Romanesque style, with an arched entranceway and tower, stone mullions and transoms, a low sweeping roof, well- fitted stonework, and a large and simple stone fa√ßade. The building's exterior is made of local light gray volcanic stone put together with Portland cement; the trimmings are of a red stone. Bourne had insisted that gray stones were used in the east fa√ßade of the building (its main fa√ßade), with darker or other colored stones usable for the other sides of the building. The roof originally used black slate roof tiles. The building has a front projection measuring , which held the main entranceway and an office and sample room. The former office has walls and ceilings of quartered oak, and includes a stone fireplace and vault door. The former sample room has paneled mahogany walls and ceilings, a parquet floor, open bottle racks on walls, and two lockers of mahogany. The windows are polished plate glass with stained glass transoms. The tasting and sales rooms are still preserved in their original form. The projection also includes a stone tower that extends one story above the roof and was built to hold a large water tank. A driveway wraps around the front and back of the building, where it is nearly level with the third floor. The interior has two distinct wings with a large hallway between them, originally with an iron staircase and a hydraulic ram elevator both leading to the third floor. Each side of the hallway on each floor had three doors wide. iron pipes were placed through the walls and floors every thirty feet in order to pipe wine from one part of the building to another, and into and out of the building. Property changes since the original construction include the front terrace, entranceway and landscaping. The former front lawn and flower beds were paved over, and a new driveway was cut into the stone wall north of the original large stone arch over the first driveway. Programs The campus' programs include associate degrees in culinary arts and in baking and pastry arts, a master's degree program in wine management, and a 30-week culinary arts certificate program. Of the campus' 300 students, approximately 60 percent are in the culinary arts degree program, 23 percent in the baking and pastry arts degree program, and 17 percent in a certificate program, as of 2013. School facilities The primary school building is the Greystone Cellars building, which houses teaching kitchens, the Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant, the Bakery Caf√© by illy, the Spice Islands Marketplace (the campus store), the De Baun and Ecolab Theatres (auditoriums and cooking demonstration facilities, also used as lecture halls), and administrative offices. Adjacent to the teaching kitchens is the Margie Schubert Library. =Teaching kitchens= alt=Rows of cooking suites within a commercial-style kitchen The teaching kitchens at Greystone are on the third floor of the primary building. The space was designed without interior walls in order to facilitate ease of movement and open exchange of ideas. The kitchens vary from common stainless steel commercial kitchens by using materials including granite, stone, tile, and wood. The kitchens use Bonnet stoves and have a variety of cooking appliances, including rotisseries, appliances for induction cooking, a stone hearth oven, convection ovens, combi steamers, French tops, and numerous large mixers. The baking and pastry kitchen has flecked granite and solid oak tables for pastry and dough preparation. On the first floor, the Viking Teaching Kitchen is designed for 36 to 40 students at a time. Its appliances and equipment were donated by Viking Range Corporation's founders and installed as part of a comprehensive redesign of the building's first floor in 2010. The redesign also involved the completion of a chocolate-making facility and the campus store and Flavor Bar. =Restaurants= alt=The restaurant's dining room The Gatehouse Restaurant, staffed by the school's degree program students, is a casual restaurant serving contemporary food with local ingredients. The Bakery Caf√© by illy is run by Baking and Pastry Arts Certificate students. The caf√© has sandwiches, salads, soups, and fresh pastries and breads, and also serves coffee, espressos, and teas. Two former restaurants operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led by students of the Farm-to-Table concentration in the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run by students in the associate degree program in culinary arts. The restaurant focused on using local and seasonal ingredients, and the dining room had open cooking stations to give diners a full view of the working kitchen. The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led to lunch service staffed by students and dinner service staffed by employees. The restaurants closed around 2016 with the campus' reorganization after purchasing Copia. =Residence halls= The campus offers housing for 130 students, and has three residence halls: the 18-room Guest House, the 41-room Vineyard Lodge I, and the 30-room Vineyard Lodge II. The residence halls have single, double, and triple-occupancy rooms. The Guest House is located on- campus and the Vineyard Lodges are about from the campus, with shuttle service to and from the buildings. The campus' newest residence hall, Vineyard Lodge II, was built around 2009 as the campus expected to double its enrollment. The building has two-stories, 31 dorm rooms, a kitchen, an activity room, an outside deck and two manager's rooms. The school planned for an environmentally-oriented dormitory, with solar panels to cover some of the building's electrical needs, as well as a membrane system for waste water. The building also has board and batten siding, which lasts longer than wooden siding. The building, on Pratt Avenue in St. Helena, is the first building in the city to be metal-framed rather than wood-framed, to better prevent termites, mold, and fire. The school estimated costs of $4 million for a Napa- based construction company to construct the building. The company demolished a laundry and facilities building in what was described as a green-oriented process. At the time of construction, the school annually enrolled 104 students; the new residence hall would allow the campus to enroll another 100 students. =Other facilities= alt=A two-story stone building and parking spaces * The De Baun Theatre is a 48-seat demonstration kitchen that hosts cooking demonstrations for the public. * The Ecolab Theatre is a 125-seat amphitheater-style demonstration auditorium that rises through the first two levels of the building. It is designed for cooking demonstrations, lectures, food and wine tastings, and other special events. The auditorium's demonstration kitchen has a cooking center, large video monitors, and fixed tables at every seat. * The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies, a two- story distillery building dating to around 1889, is used for the Professional Wine Studies program and was named after the Rudd family of Rudd Farms. The building has sensory analysis classrooms with wireless keypad response systems, built-in light boxes, and expectoration stations. The Rudd Center contains a pantry, a 4,000-bottle wine cave and private dining room, and a terrace. Karen MacNeil is the creator and chairman of the center. The building opened in 2003 for a wine professional credential; the school began its wine and beverage certification program in 2010. In 2013 the school began a wine, beverage, and hospitality concentration in its bachelor's degree program. * The Spice Islands Marketplace is the campus store, and offers culinary-related items (cooking equipment, cookbooks, uniforms, and food ingredients). Next to the store is a flavor bar that holds tasting exercises for guests. * The Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development has of classrooms, a theater- style kitchen, and interactive audience response audio technologies. * The Williams Center for Flavor Discovery, in the former gatehouse, is used by students for the study of flavors and flavor development in food and wine. The results of tasting panels at the building are shared with members of the culinary industry to enhance understanding of flavor in food, cooking, and wine.

The university was founded on July 18, 1962 by the Landtag of Bavaria as the fourth full-fledged university in Bavaria. Following groundbreaking in 1965, the university officially opened to students during the 1967‚Äì1968 winter semester, initially housing faculties in Law and Business Sciences and Philosophy. During the summer semester of 1968 the faculty of Theology was created. Currently, the University of Regensburg houses eleven faculties. The university actively participates in the European Union's SOCRATES programme as well as several TEMPUS programmes. Its most famous academic, the previous Pope Benedict XVI, served as a professor there until 1977 and formally retains his chair in theology. History Attempts to establish a university in Regensburg had been advocated since the late 15th century. In 1487, Duke Albrecht IV of Bavaria and the Regensburg city council sent a petition to Pope Innocent VIII to establish a university within the city. The idea was rejected, failing for economic reasons. In 1562, Croatian Protestant reformer Matthias Flacius again advocated the creation of a university in the city, arguing that a university in Regensburg would spread the ideas of the Protestant Reformation to Slavic lands. Protestant intellectuals again tried to establish a university in 1633, though their attempts were blocked by the arrival of imperial troops from orders of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. Following the end of the Second World War, a group of concerned intellectuals and academics in Eastern Bavaria established the Association of the Friends of the University (Verein der Freunde der Universit√§t Regensburg e. V.) in 1948, advocating the creation of a university for Regensburg and the Upper Palatinate region. The association's advocacy proved successful in 1962 when the Bavarian Landtag authorized the creation of the university. Campus and library Construction began with the official groundbreaking ceremony on November 20, 1965. The first lectures began during the 1967 winter semester, with the faculties of Law and Business Sciences and Philosophy as the first schools for students. The following year, the faculty of Catholic Theology opened to students. Since 1967, the university has expanded to twelve faculties, including medicine, biology, psychology, and chemistry. The German Research Association has deeply supported a number of research projects in the university, including the fields of biochemistry and microbiology. The university's most famous faculty member is Pope Benedict XVI, who taught from 1969 until he was appointed Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich in 1977. In 2006, one year following his election to the papacy, Benedict XVI returned to the University of Regensburg to make a highly controversial lecture that garnered the university international attention. The Pope is still listed as a Professor of the university. Another famous former faculty member, Karl Stetter, worked as head of the Archaea Center and the Department of Microbiology between 1980 and 2002. Among his discoveries were Pyrococcus furiosus in 1986, Aquifex aeolicus, Aquifex pyrophilus, and Nanoarchaeum equitans, discovered in 2002. Location and staff Situated entirely on one central campus, the university is located south of Regensburg's inner city on a small incline south of the Danube River, and directly adjacent to the Regensburg University of Applied Sciences and the A 3 autobahn. The university itself consists of 150 hectares (280 acres) of land. Including the affiliated university hospital, the University of Regensburg has approximately 4,200 employees including 312 professors, and teaches more than 20,000 students (summer term 2015). The university's reputation and attractiveness is enhanced by the 2,000-year-old town of Regensburg, its scenic countryside, the Donautal (Danube Valley), a high density of bars and the nearby heights of the Bavarian Forest. Brisk cultural life both in the city and on campus provide great recreational opportunities, enhanced by a number of nearby lakes. Faculties Faculty of physics The university is structured into eleven faculties: *Faculty of Catholic Theology *Faculty of Law *Faculty of Business, Economics and Management Information Systems *Faculty of Medicine *Faculty of Philosophy, Art History, History, and Humanities *Faculty of Psychology, Education, and Sport Science *Faculty of Languages, Literature, and Cultures *Faculty of Mathematics *Faculty of Physics *Faculty of Biology and Pre-Clinical Medicine *Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy On March 31, 2010, the mayor of Regensburg made an official application to the Bavarian government that an additional Technical University suggested by the government should go to Regensburg. Moreover: preceding to the necessary measures the existing university could simply get an additional Technical Faculty as some universities in Bavaria have, e.g. the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. In any case, the addition of such a faculty would also make sense for the Regensburg university, since in the city and its surroundings there exists a lot of engineering industry.

The university was one of the first German universities to introduce modularized study programs following the Bologna model.Report on first Bachelor's degrees awarded in 2000, http://www.uni-protokolle.de/nachrichten/id/66689/ Since 2000, most study programs have introduced bachelor's as well as master's degrees in recent years. Doctoral degrees can be obtained in most subjects as well. Cross-disciplinary co-operation, the strengthening of key competences, project orientation, and a flexible study programme are the hallmarks of these new degree programmes, preparing students for many modern career options. For international students of law, the university offers an LL.M. course in German Law. All students, irrespective of their specialisation, are offered a number of programmes which can be taken to complement their main field of study. Among these are data processing, general language courses, specialised language courses (business, law etc.), courses in oral presentation and communication, and a programme in intercultural communication. Research Key fields of activity include the Natural Sciences (Mathematics, Physics, Bio-Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy), the Humanities (History, Philologies) and Medicine. The German Research Association (DFG) currently sponsors two collaborative research centres (the SFB 1085 \\"Higher Invariants -interactions between Arithmetic Geometry and Global Analysis\\" of the Faculty of Mathematics and the CRC/Transregio 55 \\"Hadron Physics from Lattice QCD\\" of the Faculty of Physics), four research units and five interdisciplinary graduate colleges. The university participates in well over 30 EU projects. In detail: according to a recent documentation of the DFG, the physics faculty of the university in 2009 held the first place in Bavaria, and the third one in Germany, concerning the financial support. Moreover, the high-energy physicists of the faculty form the center of a large international cooperation on a basic theory in the field, the Quantum Chromodynamics, with a large special computer, called QPACE.As for the \\"QPACE\\" project, see the following video-representation Due to its geographical location near the former Iron Curtain border of the Czech Republic, the university considers itself a bridge.The bridge function of the university is also expressed by the above-mentioned seal between East and West. Working with partners in Europaeum, the University of Regensburg has set up an interdisciplinary centre for research and teaching on all aspects pertaining to Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries. As part of the focus on Eastern Europe the University of Regensburg offers degrees like Suutheastern-European Studies and Eastern European studies. The university is also home for the Bavarian University Centre for Central, East and Southeastern Europe (BAYHOST) which works on deepening cooperation between universities of the region and the state of Bavaria. The university closely cooperates with other institutions focusing on Eastern Europe in the city like the Institute for Eastern and Southeastern European studies, the Ostrecht institute (institute for Easteuropean legal studies) and the Hungarian institute among others. These institutions are all part of the centre for competence on Eastern Europe Regensburg. Rankings The University of Regensburg is ranked among the best 400 universities worldwide: * QS World University Ranking 2014: 395th * Academic Ranking of World Universities 2013: 301-400th * Center for World University Rankings 2014: 338th The Handelsblatt Ranking 2014, one of the most relevant rankings for business administration in Germany, ranked the university's Department of Business Administration among the best 25 in German-speaking Europe. Service On campus, students are provided with a large central cafeteria (Mensa) and several smaller ones, a pizzeria, a bank, a bookshop as well as various other shops. The open-access University Library, with its modern online catalogue and loan system, holds over 3.15 million books and periodicals. All students receive a PIN code for the computers, which grants free access to e-mail services and the Internet in all computer rooms throughout the campus. Students also have access to the services provided by the University‚Äôs Computer Centre in any one of the more than 20 computer pools on campus and in most of the student dormitories. Student residences, a number of which cater to students with special needs, are located in close proximity to the campus as well as in the city centre itself. In addition to its academic function, the University of Regensburg encourages numerous extracurricular activities on campus. Various choirs, musical ensembles and art exhibitions (drawings, prints, sculpture and photography) testify to a dynamic cultural life on campus. Every year, more than ten student drama groups stage their productions in the theatre on campus. Well equipped audiovisual studios cater to students with an interest in film and music production. The Sports Centre provides recreational courses for students. The choice of courses ranges from aikido to capoeira, and from kayaking to volleyball. The University‚Äôs International Office offers international students well developed orientation and integration programmes. Points of interest * Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t Regensburg, the university's botanical garden Partner Universities The university currently maintains links with over 130 European academic institutions.

It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now. It is heavily used in military training. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved. Military training Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing obstacles, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence. Military Assault Courses help develop: Physical Fitness: Strength; Stamina; Mobility. Technique: Such as how to climb over wall and lower oneself safely. Teamwork: Especially on obstacles that can only be crossed as a team such a high walls. Mental Ability: Overcoming challenges and fears by determination. Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten- foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised. However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a rifle range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford. This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork. Obstacles can be for general fitness, of for quite specific task such as cargo nets which simulates soldiers climbing down nets into Landing Craft for Beachhead Landings. Climbing through windows is a useful skill when operating in built-up areas, and climbing ladders and over walls has proved useful in operations in Afghanistan. Worldwide common assault course obstacles include barbed wire or nets to crawl under, pipes or tunnels to crawl through, walls to climb over, beams, walls or planks to balance on, steps to climb up, walls with window size holes to climb through, and mazes to negotiate. Overhead traverse (monkey bars) are popular. International Military Obstacle Course Competitions use a standard pattern Assault Course with 20 obstacles over 500m, including 2 m deep pits to climb into and out of, ladders to climb up and down, balance beams, and walls. Naval Obstacle Course Competitions are similar and have additional naval type task such as closing and securing hatches. Russian Federation Army Assault Courses have: a maze; walls with holes; steps; balance beams; tunnels and often include throwing a dummy Hand Grenade from the final trench. Russian Assault Courses' often have monkey bars in an inverted V shape, higher in the middle. The standard French Assault Course is 1640 feet long and has 20 obstacles. The British Army has two standard designs. Type A, for trained soldiers and Type B for training establishments. The design for trained soldiers has 18 different obstacles (usually in 2 or 3 lanes). The design includes: 4 steps up to 1.7m; monkey bars 5.4m long and 2.8m high; stepping-stones; 5.8m high cargo net; 10m long pipe crawl; rope swing over a 6.7m wide ditch; 8ft high OBUA (Operations in Built Up Area) double wall with ladders up and between the walls with window openings; and 8m high climbing ropes. The design for training establishments has 9 different obstacles, in 3 lanes. One lane has the easiest set of obstacles, the middle lane harder, the third lane is the hardest. This allows the recruit to progress form easier to more challenging versions of the same obstacle as they progress through their training. The design includes: a vault with heights of 1.2m, 1.5m, and 2m; a high wall of 2.1m, 2.5m and 3m; ditches wet and dry; ropes and ladders to climb 4.8m and then cross a gap of 7.3m; and a 5m long maze. Both designs are adjusted to fit the available space and terrain features, obstacles are between 5 and 10 yards apart, and not all obstacles are always used, for example the Assault Course used by British Army recruits at Pirbright has 10 obstacles, including 2 dry ditches and a cargo net, whilst the Assault Course at Worthy Down Camp has only 8 obstacles. The Royal Air Force uses the British Army designs, and has Assault Courses at RAF Honnington, RAF Halton, and the Royal Air Force College at RAF Cranwell. Whilst the primary role of a military assault course is to improve fitness, they are also used for the assessment of personnel to see if they are suitable for a specific role. Two examples are the British Army‚Äôs Parachute Regiment‚Äôs Trainasium which soldiers have to complete as one of the test to be allowed to progress to Parachute Training, and the Royal Marine‚Äôs Bottom Field Assault Course which has to be completed as one of the test for the award of the Commando Green Beret. Both of these assault courses have specific obstacles which provide a physical and psychological challenge to those completing them, the Trainasium has a lot of high obstacles and Bottom Field include a lot of obstacles with water. Trim trail The term \\"trim trail\\" has also been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination. They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercises. A key difference between a Trim Trail and an Assault Course is that at each exercise station the exercise is usually repeated multiple times as an exercise set, on an Assault Course the obstacle is only crossed once.

Zajdel. Limes inferior, one of Zajdel's best-known works, is a dystopia showing a grim vision of a future society resulting from a merger of the two systems competing at the time - communism and capitalism. It is a seemingly free society, which is in fact tightly controlled through a system of electronic biometric ID cards (Keys), censored media and other forms of social control. It was recognized as the best science fiction novel in Poland in 1982.Tales From The Planet Earth, Notes about authors Setting The story is set in a fictional 'Argoland'. All citizens in Argoland are divided into 7 social classes (numbered from 0 to 6) based on their IQ. 'Zeroes' are the top, governing class. The class of a citizen determines what job he gets, and his pay ('red, green and yellow points'). Only people with class between 0 and 4 get any jobs, any promotion is depending on the class more than achievement. This is further true because the economy seems to be centrally controlled government run socialism, that is private property is limited and small private enterprises operate only on the fringes of the general economy. 'Argoland' has an awkward monetary system - its currency are green, red and yellow points. Their value is different - red points are almost valueless - only basic items like basic food can be bought for them, green points have a bit higher value and only yellow points have real value. Conversely, only employed are paid any yellow points, the more the higher their class. That means only those with class over 4 (and practically 3 because there is a shortage of jobs for class 4 and no jobs for lower classes) can get any yellow points officially. Therefore, a black exchange market for points flourishes. The 'points' are kept on a 'Key' which serves as an electronic wallet. The Key displays the class of its bearer and its other functions are activated by owner's touch on a built-in fingerprint reader. The Key is similar to modern PDAs serving as an ID card, credit card, a watch, a calculator and a biometric reader. Argoland is a city-state, located on the shores of lake Tibigan. The countryside is said to be uninhabited with farms operated by robots. The novel alludes that the whole humanity lives in such cities and leaving a city is not possible (vehicles used by the citizens of Argoland cease to operate at the city borders). Travel between city-states is possible but restricted and therefore not available to general population. However, people at large seem not interested in leaving their city being sure that life in other city-states is exactly the same as in theirs. Official government or economic structure of Argoland is not discussed in the book. Religion of any kind is also totally absent. However many aspects of social control like stupidators added to cheap food to keep lower classes under control, tracing people through their 'points' transactions etc. are discussed in detail. Plot summary The hero, Adi Cherryson, also known as Sneer (named after one of Zajdel's fellow science fiction writers Adam Wi≈õniewski- Snerg), is a lifter who \\"helps\\" people cheat during the computer controlled IQ exams by giving them the correct answers through a micro-radio communicator or taking the exam for them. Sneer, who is officially only a level 4, could easily become the top level 0, but he prefers his medium level which doesn't attract much attention. In addition to lifters a whole gallery of black market figures is presented - there are downers (who use their low IQ to provide realistic 'stupid' answers for those who want to keep their class artificially low like Sneer), chameleons (black market point dealers), key-makers (providing all sorts of illegal, special purpose Keys). The story starts when Sneer is questioned by an undercover police agent on the street and unintentionally reveals his intelligence by his answers (or so Sneer thinks). As a result, a few hours later his Key is locked and he is told to report to a testing station for an IQ test. Knowing that in such situation \\"electro- hipnosis\\" is used to prevent subjects from hiding their true intelligence, he solicits help of a \\"downer\\". He finds a suitable specialist through another \\"lifter\\" - Karl Pron. He goes to the testing station with the \\"downer\\", who takes his Key and goes inside, leaving Sneer waiting outside. A few minutes later Sneer sees the \\"downer\\" arrested. Without his Key he faces the reality of not having a shelter and being able to even find anything to eat without points. Wandering through the city, he sees some of the misery of life in Argoland he didn't notice before. Finally, he meets mysterious Alice, who gives him shelter and some mysterious clues about a singer and a song about the lake Tibigan. In the morning he meets the \\"downer\\" and learns how he secured his release through a ruse - he reported Sneer's Key as found on the street. Sneer goes to the central police station and retrieves his Key, but the experience makes him uncomfortable, and he starts to look at his world in a different way. He visits his parents and an old friend, a doctor, revealing to the reader the history of this world and some further facts about it. He also tries to listen to the song Alice told him about and discovers that theoretical freedom of press is in fact a fiction as some songs etc. can be prohibited. Meanwhile, Sneer is hired by a government official (a 'zero') to monitor the scientific lab dealing with Keys - The Key Institute. Working undercover as a doorman, Sneer discovers to his amazement that the Key Institute that should know everything about the Keys, having designed them, is in fact studying them as if they were an alien object. Meanwhile, his \\"lifter\\" friend Karl Pron tests a new counterfeited Key, which gives the owner an unlimited amount of yellow points. This Key was ordered by the group of '0's ‚Äì who in fact work in the lab on which Sneer is now spying upon. When Sneer obtains the super Key, he is taken to the meeting with top officials of the local government, where he learns that the social system of 'Argoland' is, in fact, an experiment imposed upon the humanity by the Aliens. The 'over-zeroes' form a ruling class, which suppresses dissent fearful of the Aliens but permits all kinds of irregularities which they see as preserving the human nature of people. The end is largely mystical, but it suggests that, with the help of Alice, Sneer succeeds in saving humanity, though it is not clear exactly how he achieves that.  Interpretation  As with much utopian and dystopian fiction in the former Soviet bloc countries, where open criticism of the government was dangerous and subject to censorship, this book was interpreted by many as in fact a criticism of the system disguised as an SF novel to evade censorship (the \\"aliens\\", who are military superpower and are simultaneously enforcing a social system invented by them and thought by them to be the best one for the entire universe, actually look strongly, from such a description made in the book, like the Soviets themselves). However, it can be interpreted more broadly as a novel on how would a system resulting from a mix or convergence of the main systems then competing - communism and capitalism - look like. Some argue that many of the author's visions - for example possibility of totalitarian control on a large scale through digital systems without tracking any single individual in particular - can be seen as existing in the current world. Many aspects of the 'Argoland' society, seemingly fictional to the book's Western readers, represented an everyday situation in communist countries. For example, in the shortage economy, luxury goods were available from a state-run chain of shops (like Pewex) selling products only for hard-to-obtain foreign currency.

He was influenced by Friedrich Hayek, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michael Polanyi and Ludwig Lachmann. He wrote two books on the problem of economic calculation. His first book on this subject was Rivalry and Central Planning (Cambridge University Press 1985). This book stressed the importance of the process of competitive rivalry in markets. His second book was National Economic Planning: What Is Left? (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1985). This book dealt with the problem of non- comprehensive planning. Early life and education Lavoie earned a BS in computer science in 1973 from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He then earned a PhD in economics in 1981 from New York University under Israel Kirzner.Don Lavoie Curriculum Vitae 2001 His thesis was entitled Rivalry and central planning: a re-examination of the debate over economic calculation under socialism. Career Don Lavoie joined the faculty of the economics department of George Mason University as an assistant professor in 1981. He was co-founder of the interdisciplinary unit known as the Program on Social & Organizational Learning at George Mason University. As a young professor, he worked on the philosophy and practice of electronically mediated discourse. He knew the importance for organizations of new ways of cultivating interactive learning environments (groupware and hypertext software environments) in order to enhance communicative processes. He showed the fundamental nature of social learning processes, whether in market exchanges, in verbal conversations, or in hypertext-based dialogue. As a scholar, he studied the philosophy of the social sciences (especially the application of hermeneutics to economics) and Comparative economic systems (especially Marxian theories of socialism). Along with Richard Ebeling, Lavoie pioneered the attempt to merge Austrian Economics with philosophical hermeneutics in the late 1980s, and in particular with the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer. His influence here extended to many of his students mentioned above. His effort drew criticism from several members of the Austrian School associated with the Mises Institute, especially Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe. In the book Culture and Enterprise: The Development, Representation and Morality of Business (New York: Routledge, 2000) written with Emily Chamlee-Wright, they take into account the important role of culture in a nation's economic development.

These words exist in \\"several different languages as a result of simultaneous or successive borrowings from the ultimate source\\" (I.V.Arnold). Pronunciation and orthography are similar so that the word is understandable between the different languages. It is debated how many languages are required so that a word is an internationalism. Furthermore, the languages required can also depend on the specific target language at stake. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the most important languages that should include the same lexical item in order for it to qualify as an internationalism in Hebrew are Yiddish, Polish, Russian, French, German and English.Pages 187-188 in Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew, by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. The term is uncommon in English, although English has contributed a considerable number of words to world languages, e.g., the sport terms football, baseball, cricket, and golf. Origins European internationalisms originate primarily from Latin or Greek, but from other languages as well. However, due to English being the main lingua franca of the Western world, an increasing number of internationalisms originate from English. Many non- European words have also become international. Diffusion Internationalisms often spread together with the innovations they designate. Accordingly, there are semantic fields dominated by specific languages, e.g. the computing vocabulary which is mainly English with internationalisms such as computer, disk, and spam. New inventions, political institutions, foodstuffs, leisure activities, science, and technological advances have all generated new lexemes and continue to do so: bionics, cybernetics, gene, coffee, chocolate, etc.. Some internationalisms are spread by speakers of one language living in geographical regions where other languages are spoken. For example, some internationalisms coming from the English in India are bungalow, jute, khaki, mango, pyjamas, and sari. Use in constructed IALs Due to their widespread use, internationalisms are often loaned into international auxiliary languages. Many constructed IALs borrow vocabulary that is already known by learners, so that they are as easy as possible to learn. Internationalisms that occur in many languages are usually eligible to be included in Interlingua. Early internationalisms, such as those from French and German, tend to be part of Interlingua's basic vocabulary. Later internationalisms, often from English, tend to be Interlingua loanwords. Among Asian languages, Arabic most often provides basic vocabulary, while Japanese contributes recent loanwords.

Zajdel. It is a dystopian novel similar to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. The space colonies are more or less federated with the Earth. Human rights are observed and respected everywhere, but Paradise has not been verified for sure. The main hero, writer Rinah Devi, is sent from Earth to Paradise to research that and the tragic death of a Terran sent to Paradise ten years before. Officially, though, the purpose of his visit is to write about Paradise. It was recognized as the best science fiction novel of the year in Poland in 1984.Tales From The Planet Earth, Notes about authors In the Polish People's Republic, it was widely understood as a metaphor for the USSR: omnipotent state security services and propaganda, single state ideology and forced labour. Plot Paradyzja (from \\"paradise\\") is the story about the human colony on a space station orbiting a distant and mineral rich star system. The colony is controlled by a totalitarian regime. All human activity is tracked by electronic devices. It had been primarily devised as a ring in which the gravity force is simulated by the centrifugal force exerting upon all objects inside a ring tube in the direction opposite to the centre of the ring. The space station was built accidentally. The expedition had to settle on the planet Tartar in order to live there and exploit the natural goods. But General Cortazar, the leader of settlers, decided that Tartar was not suitable for settling because of a lack of good conditions for living, so the living place had to be built as a space station on the Tartar's orbit. On Paradise, living rooms are made of transparent material and to get to some of them, one must pass through other living rooms. Personal watches are not allowed there; the only clocks are those in living rooms. Rinah Devi's first impression is that all people strictly adhere to the regime law, but he then discovers that they had devised various ways to work around the system. One of them is \\"the only language of truth\\", Koalang, an artificial poetic language invented by the inhabitants of Paradise to evade the electronic eavesdropping system. The government and the safety service is trying to suppress every possible knowledge of physics, which could allow a verification of the statements about what Paradise is as presented to Paradisians. That is why every research in physics is blocked, especially every research about Coriolis force. The main hero discovered it when he was trying to check whether the forces really differ on every floor: all things that would be used to make such an experiment, even such as a spring from his ballpen, have been taken from him by the customs officers and no other things that would make such a simple experiment possible are accessible. Then, he discovers that minutes on clocks in living rooms are not equal in length. Finally, he finds out that Paradise is not a ring-tube space station but a train of buildings lying on the surface of the planet. In addition, Tartar is a planet quite well suitable for settlement, and the group in charge built some buildings and gardens for itself and kept the majority of settlers in the fictional Paradise and made them believe that it was an artificial planet.

Schermerhorn as the \\"...degree to which the people affected by decision are treated by dignity and respect\\" (Organizational Behavior, 2013). The theory focuses on the interpersonal treatment people receive when procedures are implemented. Interactional justice, a subcomponent of organizational justice, has come to be seen as consisting of two specific types of interpersonal treatment (e.g. Greenberg, 1990a, 1993b). The first labeled interpersonal justice, reflects the degree to which people are treated with politeness, dignity, and respect by authorities or third parties involved in executing procedures or determining outcomes. The second, labeled informational justice, focuses on the explanations provided to people that convey information about why procedures were used in a certain way or why outcomes were distributed in a certain fashion. Where more adequacy of explanation is prevalent, the perceived level of informational justice is higher (Sam Fricchione, 2006). Within an organization It is important that a high degree of interactional justice exists in a subordinate/supervisor relationship in order to reduce the likelihood of counterproductive work behavior. If a subordinate perceives that interactional injustice exists, then the subordinate will hold feelings of resentment toward either the supervisor or institution and will therefore seek to \\"even the score\\". A victim of interaction injustice will have increased expressions of hostility toward the offender which can manifest in actions of counterproductive work behavior and reduce the effectiveness of organizational communication. Abuse directed toward a subordinate from a supervisor often stems from displaced aggression. In this case, the individual (supervisor) is unwilling to retaliate against the direct source of mistreatment and will therefore abuse a less threatening target such as a subordinate since the subordinate is incapable of retaliation. Thus, interactional injustice can essentially trickle-down from the top of an organization to the bottom due to displaced aggression that exists in the top ranks of the hierarchy.

Music career =Early bands= Steinbl√≥m (Stone Flowers) (1969) was his first group. It was a trio formed by Gu√∞laugur (electric and acoustic guitars), Haraldur Johannessen (acoustic guitar) and Gunnar Magn√∫sson (acoustic bass). Steinbl√≥m played punk versions of artists such as Bob Dylan and Donovan, Gu√∞laugur originals and folk songs. At that time, he was experimenting with homemade electro-acoustic guitars and amplifiers. Steinbl√≥m played gigs in Reykjav√≠k and the suburbs. L√≥tus was created while he was at Laugarvatn high school in 1972. In 1974 and 1975 and played all over Iceland in 1974 when the country celebrated its 1,100th anniversary. L√≥tus was basically a rock band whose members were Gu√∞laugur, Gu√∞j√≥n Sigurbj√∂rnsson, both on electric guitars, B√∂√∞var Helgi Sigur√∞sson (electric bass), Gu√∞mann √ûorvaldsson (drums) and Sigur√∞ur Ingi P√°lsson (vocals). Lotus' music was in the jazz-rock style of Dave Brubeck and Gu√∞laugur originals, including arrangements to Mozart and Beethoven in a rock style. L√≥tus did not release any record, but they did some two-track recordings believed to be lost. He joined Sextettinn (Sextet) (1977) when he was at University. He joined Sveinbj√∂rn Baldvinsson (guitarist), Gunnar Hrafnsson (bass), Stef√°n Stef√°nsson (saxophone), Gu√∞j√≥n Hilmarsson (drums), and Krist√≠n J√≥hannsd√≥ttir (vocals). The music of Sextettinn was original themes performed in several different styles from country-rock and pop-rock to pop-jazz. Sextettinn gigged throughout Iceland and had a presentation at the local TV station. Gu√∞laugur stayed for a short time, as his studies were taking most of his time. The remaining members of the group continued under a different name: Lj√≥sin √≠ B√¶num, (The Lights of the City) and released an album still popular in Iceland. Gu√∞laugur then joined a group called Galdrakarlar & Wilma Reading (The Wizards & Wilma Reading) (1977). This band consisted of brass, keyboards, guitars, bass and drums. The band toured Iceland and gave around 30 concerts. Wilma Reading (vocals), was the group leader. She was an Australian singer and actress with roots in Broadway and Hollywood. Their music style was mainly jazz-oriented ith influences from George Gershwin, Louis Armstrong, Oscar Hammerstein II to Duke Ellington. The other members of Galdrakarlar & Wilma Reading, besides were: Birgir Einarsson (trumpet), Hl√∂√∞ver Sm√°ri Haraldsson (keyboards), Hrei√∞ar Sigurj√≥nsson (clarinet and saxophone baritone), P√©tur Hj√°lmarsson (electric bass), S√≥fus J√≥n Bj√∂rnsson (drums) and Stef√°n Stef√°nsson (saxophone soprano and flute). =√ûeyr= In January 1981, Gu√∞laugur joined √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson on guitar, Hilmar √ñrn Agnarsson (electric bass), Magn√∫s Gu√∞mundsson (lead vocals) and Sigtryggur Baldursson, (drums/percussion). By spring 1981 their first single was on the streets. It was \\"Life Transmission\\", the band's first work sung in English. By autumn they came up with I√∞ur til F√≥ta, a four-track EP. Its cassette version featured \\"Brennu-Nj√°lssaga\\", the soundtrack to the eponymous film by Fri√∞rik √û√≥r Fri√∞riksson about Nj√°l's saga. In late 1981 √ûeyr released an album titled Mj√∂tvi√∞ur M√¶r. In 1982, √ûeyr released their last album with the title of As Above.... This work contains English versions of the group‚Äôs hits. The most notable song of this record was \\"Killer Boogie\\" since it is considered as an attempt to achieve an international position. In 1982 the group performed on a concert in Reykjav√≠k that was recorded and went out as a live concert release named Rokk √≠ Reykjav√≠k (Rock in Reykjav√≠k). This concert gathered some of the important Icelandic bands including Purrkur Pillnikk and Tappi T√≠karrass. √ûeyr appeared in this compilation with two songs: \\"Killer Boogie\\" and \\"R√∫dolf\\". That year the group released an EP titled The Fourth Reich. In 1982, Jaz Coleman, the singer of Killing Joke, had moved to Iceland because he feared that the end of the world was looming. He collaborated with several music bands, but above all with √ûeyr, and created a group originally called Iceland, but subsequently renamed Niceland. Although this group was formed by Coleman and √ûeyr‚Äôs musicians, it did not include √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson, the other guitarist. After rehearsing, Niceland was ready to record 5 songs in 1983, but two were not finished; the three recorded songs were: \\"Guess Again\\", \\"Catalyst\\" and \\"Take What‚Äôs Mine\\". They have never been released officially and still remain as unpublished material. In 1983, √ûeyr released the last single: \\"Lunaire\\". In 2001, thanks to the support of family and friends, he released a CD to commemorate √ûeyr‚Äôs 20th anniversary. This CD contained newly discovered mixes of I√∞ur til F√≥ta y Mj√∂tvi√∞ur M√¶r, and was named Mj√∂tvi√∞ur til F√≥ta. =Kukl and the Elgar Sisters= Following √ûeyr, Gu√∞laugur and Sigtryggur joined Einar √ñrn Benediktsson, the vocalist of Purrkur Pillnikk, Einar Arnaldur Melax keyboardist from Med√∫sa, Bj√∂rk Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir, vocalist of Tappi T√≠karrass and bassist Birgir Mogensen from Spilaf√≠fl when √Åsmundur J√≥nsson from Gramm (then Iceland's most important record company) wanted to create a band with cutting- edge artists to perform for the last edition of the radio program √Åfangar which had been cancelled. After composing and rehearsing for two weeks the group appeared under the name of Kukl (\\"Sorcery\\", in Medieval Icelandic). Although Kukl's style was a type of dark gothic rock in the style of Killing Joke and innovative references to the Fall's post-punk, it was later defined by Bj√∂rk as \\"existential jazz-punk-hardcore\\". While touring Iceland, they performed with the pro-anarchy group Crass and subsequently visited the United Kingdom in a series of gigs with Flux of Pink Indians. Their first release was the single \\"S√∂ngull\\" in 1983, a version of \\"Dismembered\\", corresponding to their following release of The Eye, an album released in 1984. With respect to this work, Sounds magazine gave it 5 stars (excellent) for expanding the music imposed by Crass Records. With decaying metals, disrupted rock sounds and vocal inflections of \\"Assassin\\" that show the essence of this album. Other songs include \\"The Spire\\" that stands out with central phrases overlapped to background lines and the song \\"Anna\\", maker of a threatening environment. On September 14, 1984, Kukl performed in Paris, where they recorded a cassette edited by French independent record label V.I.S.A. with the title of KUKL √† Paris 14.9.84. Kukl continued with another album titled Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought) in 1986. It was released through Crass Records. This work is far more complex and all wind instruments were replaced by keyboards and bells. Songs like \\"A Mutual Thrill\\" are a m√©lange of pop and experimental post-indie music. √û√≥r Eldon J√≥nsson, the guitarist of Med√∫sa had been dating Bj√∂rk when she became pregnant, so Kukl became an exhausting task. Einar √ñrn was studying in London and when he came back to Iceland in summer 1986 decided that Kukl was over and a new project should be set up in order to deal with the group‚Äôs expenditures. The Sugarcubes band soon followed, ending Kukl. Gu√∞laugur and Birgir Mogensen were the only musicians who did not continue on the new project. Gu√∞laugur and Bj√∂rk created the Elgar Sisters, which coexisted with Kukl, although it lasted longer. This group released no albums, but did record 11 songs from 1984 to 1986. Gu√∞laugur (electric and acoustic guitarist) and composed most of the songs. Bj√∂rk (vocals), composed three songs (two with Gu√∞laugur). The Elgar Sisters could be seen as their duo project. The other musicians were Birgir Mogensen (electric bass), Einar Melax (keyboards), Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson (H√ñH) (keyboards and synthetic drums), Sigtryggur Baldursson (drums/percussion and √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson (electric guitar). A few songs recorded by the Elgar Sisters came to light via Bj√∂rks‚Äôs solo career and on Gu√∞laugur's solo album released in late 2005. =Other music projects= H√¶ttuleg Hlj√≥msveit (\\"The Dangerous Orchestra\\") was a group in which he participated along Magn√∫s √û√≥r J√≥nsson (Megas), Bj√∂rk, Birgir Baldursson, and Haraldur √ûorsteinsson. This group, which was active from 1990-1991 was established after the release of H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit & gl√¶pakvendi√∞ Stella, an album by Megas in 1990. The band did many concerts in southwestern Iceland, in the outskirts of Reykjav√≠k and later in rural areas of Northern Iceland. By this period Bj√∂rk was no longer a member. H√¶ttuleg Hlj√≥msveit never released a record. M√ñK Trio was a group formed by bassist T√≥mas Magn√∫s T√≥masson (mainly known by his work in Stu√∞menn), Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson and Gu√∞laugur. In fact, the name stemmed from the initials corresponding to the middle name of each member. Their first gig was approximately in 1992. M√ñK Trio did not play regularly and they never released an album. Their last presentation was in August 2001 at Galdrah√°t√≠√∞in √° Str√∂ndum, Reykjav√≠k. INRI was a project of Magn√∫s Jensson. Gu√∞laugur joined Magn√∫s and played extensively through Iceland in irregular periods from 1993. Some tracks were recorded in 1995. Gvdl was a group created in 2001 with Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson and bassist Georg Bjarnason for the arrival of the American band Fuck. In fact, the sequence Gvdl corresponds to Fuck with each letter switched to the next one in the alphabet. =Collaborations=  Psychic TV  In 1984 Gu√∞laugur added guitars on Psychic TV‚Äôs album Those Who Do Not. This work was produced by Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson and Gu√∞laugur and used one of his inventions, the P-Orridgemeter. It was a device that could be programmed with any given frequency and was activated to make an identical structure and pattern for other sampled sound. By this means, digital or sound samples were \\"played\\" by individuals who were not physically present. For instance, a vocalist could activate a bell sound. This could be recorded as an identical pattern and then the voice was erased. In 1987 these tracks were reissued with a different name, Live in Reykjavik, an album that was released by Temple Records, the record label owned by Genesis P-Orridge.  Megas  Gu√∞laugur contributed to multiple albums by Megas, the Icelandic rock father, as a guitarist, arranger and composer. His first contribution was in 1987 for the album Loftmynd and in 1988 he appeared again on H√∂fu√∞lausnir, which featured Bj√∂rk and Rose McDowell as backing vocalists. In 1990 Gu√∞laugur added guitars on H√¶ttuleg Hlj√≥msveit & Gl√¶pakvendi√∞ Stella, an album featuring The Sugarcubes. In 1992 appeared on √ûr√≠r Bl√≥√∞dropar, an album with the addition of Bubbi Morthens, M√≥ei√∞ur J√∫n√≠usd√≥ttir, and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson. Dr√∂g a√∞ Upprisu followed in 1994. In 2002, Gu√∞laugur's contributions were featured on the compilation Megas 1972-2002. The same year he joined Megas playing the song \\"Edge and Over\\" for F√°lkar, the soundtrack to Fri√∞riksson‚Äôs film Falcons. =Bubbi Morthens= In 1989 Gu√∞laugur worked with singer Bubbi Morthens for the 10 track album N√≥ttin Langa. Part of this work is featured on Bubbi‚Äôs S√∂gur 1980-1990, a 1999 compilation. =Bj√∂rk= In August 1993 Bj√∂rk released Venus as a Boy featuring an Elgar Sisters song, \\"St√≠g√∞u Mig\\" on the second CD. In November Big Time Sensuality went out featuring other Elgar songs, \\"S√≠√∞asta √âg\\" and \\"Glora\\". On November 4, 2002 Bj√∂rk released a CD box titled Family Tree, containing three songs featuring Gu√∞laugur, \\"S√≠√∞asta √âg\\" and \\"Fuglar\\". =Other artists= In 1987 he worked on Crowleymass, an album by Current 93, the band led by David Tibet (ex Psychic TV), with the collaboration of H√ñH who at that time was in Nyarlathotep's Idiot Flute Players. It was a single edited by Maldoror in a limited edition of 2,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In 1990 Gu√∞laugur played on Crusher of Bones, an album released by Reptilicus. Produced by H√ñH, it was an example of darkwave/industrial of the early 1990s. In 1994 he worked with Neol Einsteiger on the album Heitur Vindur and by 1995 added guitars on the song \\"Eftirm√°li og √Ålyktarnir\\" which appeared on Kj√∂ttromman, an album released by EXEM, the band led by Einar Melax and poet √ûorri J√≥h. In 1998 he played on Ull by S√∫kkat, a band formed by Haf√æ√≥r and Gunnar √ìlafsson. In 2003 Gu√∞laugur played with Graveslime on their album Roughness and Toughness. He played on the song \\"American Sleeper\\". =Solo career= With a free style and influences from Frank Zappa and Duke Ellington he performed on national TV and radio stations accompanied by other musicians or just solo concerts. In 2002 he released an album called Alone with Guitar that contained arrangements to five pieces of Bach. It was followed by another CD containing tracks from the Elgar Sisters and some of his live performances. On October 23, 2004, he was asked to compose a song to be performed by the belfry of Hallgr√≠mskirkja (the Icelandic cathedral). The song was performed by the church organist during the Iceland Airwaves festival. On December 9, 2005, he released Dense Time, his first solo album. It is a review of his music work, including new songs and featuring Icelandic musicians including Bj√∂rk, Megas, Agnar Wilhelm Agnarsson, Ragnhildur G√≠slad√≥ttir, Gu√∞mundur J√≥nsson (an operatic singer and Gu√∞laugur's stepfather), Gu√∞munsson, and others. It was produced by Gu√∞laugur with Arni Gu√∞j√≥nsson (leader of the band Leaves), and guitarist Gu√∞mundur P√©tursson. In mid-October, he broke his left arm in an accident and several shows had to be canceled. On December 16, Pronil Holdings is (a company in charge of his music royalties and scientific patents) was officially registered. Dense Time was reissued by Bad Taste in late 2017. Personal life Gu√∞laugur Kristinn √ìttarsson has two daughters: Ellen Svava Gu√∞laugsd√≥ttir (1973) and Hera √û√∂ll Gu√∞laugsd√≥ttir (1981).

Together these villages form a civil parish situated beside the River Thames south of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. The river forms the parish boundary to the east and south, and also the county boundary between Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The villages have two discrete centres separated by agricultural land. The largest is Lower Shiplake, centred around Shiplake railway station on the Henley Branch Line. It is the economic centre of the parish and contains a store & post office, butcher shop, The Baskerville pub as well as most of the homes in the parish. southwest of Lower Shiplake are the older, contiguous settlements of Shiplake and Shiplake Cross. Shiplake village is the historic and religious centre of the parish and contains Shiplake Farm, the Parish church of SS Peter & Paul on Church Lane, Shiplake House, Plowden Arms pub and Shiplake College independent boarding school. The College occupies the building and site of the historic Shiplake Court. Shiplake village contains numerous Grade II* and II listed buildings and monuments. Shiplake Cross is the sporting and community centre of the parish. It consists of just five roads: Memorial Avenue, Orchard Close, Plough Lane, Plowden Way and Schoolfields. It contains the Shiplake Memorial Hall, Shiplake Village Bowling Club (founded 1920) and Shiplake Tennis & Social Club as well as Shiplake CE Primary School and Nursery. Historically, the parish also included Binfield Heath, west of the historic Shiplake village. Since 2003 it has been a separate civil parish. The 2011 Census records the parish (on its adjusted scale) population as 1,954 and containing 679 homes. The A4155 main road linking Henley with Reading, Berkshire passes through the parish. Toponym The earliest known surviving records of the toponym \\"Shiplake\\" are from the 13th century. The Book of Fees records Sciplak in 1236 and the Taxatio Ecclesiastica records Schipelak in 1292. It is derived from Old English and means \\"stream where sheep were washed\\". The other supposed origin is a mix of Saxon (Scip=ship) and Danish (Lack= to want or not to possess) 'lack of ships' and may relate to a Viking practice of sinking boats as a cache. Vikings raided the Thames and attacked Reading in 871. The Viking option was preferred by Emily J Climenson in her 1894 tome, 'The History of Shiplake'. Parish church The Church of England parish church of SS Peter and Paul dates from at least the 13th century and is the centre of the Church of England parish of Shiplake. In 1869 the church was restored and enlarged to designs by the Gothic Revival architect GE Street. The chancel, north aisle and parts of the south aisle were rebuilt and the tracery of all its windows were replaced. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The church tower has a ring of eight bells, all recast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 2009. Shiplake Church also has a Sanctus bell cast by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon in 1929. The earliest reference to Shiplake‚Äôs bells is in an inventory dating from the reign of Edward VI (1547‚Äì53): \\"Item ‚Äì Three belles in ye steeple\\".http://www.shiplakedunsdenharpsden.org.uk/shiplake/ The church bells were rung for Alfred Lord Tennyson's wedding on 13 June 1850. The ceremony was performed by the Reverend Robert Rawnsley who was Vicar from 1849-62. Tennyson gave the vicar a poem in lieu of payment for the ceremony: Vicar of that pleasant spot, Where it was my chance to marry, Happy, happy be your lot, In the vicarage by the quarry: You were he that knit the knot. Shaft cross in the parish churchyard In the churchyard is a Gothic Revival shaft cross. It was erected in 1908 as a monument to a member of the Phillimore family. It is Grade II listed. Economic and social history In 1773 the Thames Navigation Commission built Shiplake Lock on the River Thames about downriver from the main village. About 1830 Shiplake House was built. It is a three-storey early 19th-century Regency house just east of what is now Shiplake College. Part of the rear and side has a decorative wrought iron verandah. In 1857 the Great Western Railway opened the Henley branch line between and , crossing the Thames on Shiplake Railway Bridge, about downstream from Shiplake Lock. The GWR built Shiplake railway station at Lower Shiplake, northeast of the older part of the village. Lower Shiplake has since grown into the largest settlement within the parish. The original railway bridge was of timber. In 1897 the GWR replaced it with the present iron bridge. In 1889 the author Jerome K. Jerome featured Shiplake in his novel Three Men in a Boat. Houses by the Thames at Lower Shiplake Most homes in Shiplake were built or rebuilt after the railway arrived. These include Shiplake Court, an historic estate and country house beside the parish church that overlooks the Thames. Shiplake Court was re-built between 1890 and about 1905. In 1959 it became Shiplake College, an independent boarding school.Shiplake College Some of the college buildings are Grade II listed, including its \\"extraordinary\\" water tower. In 2003 the village of Binfield Heath and hamlet of Crowsley were separated from Shiplake civil parish to form the new civil parish of Binfield Heath.Binfield Heath, Oxfordshire Binfield Heath and Crowsley remain part of the Church of England parish of Shiplake, as does Eye and Dunsden to the south.

Originally one organisation, it split in 1982. One Libertarian Alliance was renamed \\"Mises UK\\" in 2017; the remaining Libertarian Alliance holds regular meetings in London. Early history The Libertarian Alliance was founded to advocate the abolition of taxation and government intervention in economic and social life. With ancestral ties to the Liberty and Property Defence League of Lord Elcho and Sir Ernest Benn's Society of Individualists, the LA was founded in the 1970s by Mark Brady, Judy Englander, David Ramsay Steele and Chris Tame in Woking. It was an alliance of libertarians, minarchists, anarchists, and classical liberals. The LA was perceived to be the continuation of the Radical Libertarian Alliance founded by Brady and Tame in late 1971, or the earlier Young Libertarians founded by David Myddelton in the late 1960s.\\"About\\", Libertarian Alliance. The principles of the LA were formulated by the founding members, and written out by David Ramsay Steele in its first Tactical Note.\\"Purpose and Strategy of the Libertarian Alliance\\" Libertarian Alliance, Tactical Note Number 1 At its founding, the LA had no official leader, but had a chairperson, secretary, and a treasurer.

Microsoft Photo Story for Windows FAQs The software uses the Ken Burns Effect on digital photos and allows adding narration, effects, transitions and background music to create a Windows Media Video movie file with pan and zoom effects. Once a photo story has been made, it can be played on a PC using Windows Media Player. Since the .wmv format is used, Windows Media Video Image (a sub-set of Windows Media Video) is incompatible with domestic DVD players, users wishing to create a DVD or CD will need to use third-party tools to convert into DVD compatible (e.g. MPEG 2) format first. Version 2 was included in Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition and Microsoft Digital Image Suite versions 9 and 10. It supported exporting the photo story as a Video CD. Version 3.0, although still a free download from Microsoft, removed direct Video CD burning, but supported a paid-for add-on from Sonic Solutions for exporting and burning the photo story to DVD. The final free download version (3.0) includes the ability to randomly generate background music which is composed on the fly from a combination of themes and also includes basic photo editing and touchup features. Paul Thurott's SuperSite for Windows: Photo Story 3 Review The last version of Photo Story (3.1) was included with the discontinued Microsoft Digital Image 2006. It restored the ability to burn a Video CD using the Sonic Burning engine. To burn CDs or DVDs from files generated by version 3.0, users may purchase Sonic MyDVD DVD burning software or the Sonic DVD for Photo Story 3 for Windows Sonic DVD for Photo Story 3 for Windows plug in (which burns one DVD per Story). Third party tools, such as Media Coder, often do a very poor (low quality) job of converting Photo Story wmv files - Windows Movie Maker does a far better job of converting into an intermediate .avi format (although this will be some 30 times larger than the original wmv) which many DVD Authoring packages will accept as input. The final DVD compatible MPEG2 file size will typically be 5 to 6 times larger than the original .wmv file (or about 6 times smaller than the avi). History Photo Story originally was based on a Microsoft Research project in photo sharing. Bill Gates Speech Transcript: Future Forum The chief finding of that research was that people narrated better stories when they moved their hands, made gestures and pointed at their images. Early Photo Story prototype versions encouraged people to point at their images using the mouse, as the pointing would affect the algorithm that generated the pans and zooms. The same research showed that users did not like the sound of their voice and tended to record their narration over and over again. PhotoStory: Preserving Emotion in Digital Photo Sharing This made the narration less spontaneous and the resulting stories less interesting if people were unable to express themselves clearly. Therefore, the early prototype had only one button, called the \\"Oops!\\" button. The research showed that if there was an OOPS! button available to undo their actions, people would be assured by its presence but would not use it unless they truly made a mistake during narration. Photo Story was not included with Windows XP, though it was and continues to be made available as a free download to authenticated users. Vista and Windows 7 both include Photo Story type applications (Windows Movie Maker and Windows DVD Maker), however some users still prefer the flexibility offered by the original. Limitations The maximum number of images that may be imported in a single batch is 200. The maximum image size is 72,300 (width) x 7,200 (height) pixels. The maximum output resolution offered by Microsoft is 1024 x 768, however 3rd parties have developed new output .prx 'profiles' that, if placed in your \\\\Photo Story 3 for Windows\\\\Profiles\\\\1033 sub-folder, can be selected at output time. The single supported video output format is .wmv (using the Windows Media Video 9.1 Image codec, a subset of Windows Media Video). The single supported audio output format is AAC (Advanced Audio Coding). The 'crop' and 'zoom' tool is fixed at 4:3 aspect ratio. To support 16:9 wide screen output (which is possible to obtain at output time using a third-party profile), it is necessary to 'pre-distort' all your imported images by adjusting the image height to 133.33%. The chargeable 'Roxio' plug- in (now owned by Sony) allows users to 'burn' their completed 'story' direct to a DVD or CD. Sonic MyDVD (v5.5 or higher) is required if you want to edit the disc and add more stories or movies, thus more available storage. Users should avoid any 'crop' or 'zoom' size below their intended output resolution - ideally, stop at twice the output size. If a smaller crop or zoom is required, significantly better results will be achieved by resizing the original in some third-party application (e.g. PaintShop Pro, PhotoShop) first. Photo Story is not officially supported on the Vista or Windows 7 platform, although it downloads and installs fine on both Vista and Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit.

Plot summary Having achieved fame and financial security, Captain Sir Horatio Hornblower has married Lady Barbara Leighton (n√©e Wellesley) and is preparing to settle down to unaccustomed life as the squire of Smallbridge in Kent. He still yearns to serve at sea and accepts with alacrity when the Admiralty appoints him a commodore, puts him in command of a squadron and sends him on a diplomatic and military mission to the Baltic. His primary aim is to bring Russia into the war against Napoleon. Hornblower is shown dealing with the problems of squadron command, and using naval mortars (carried on special ships known as bomb vessels) to destroy a French privateer. This leads to the French invasion of Swedish Pomerania. Later his squadron calls at Kronstadt, where he meets with Russian officials, including Tsar Alexander I, who is favourably impressed by Hornblower and his squadron. Hornblower narrowly averts a major diplomatic incident when his interpreter, a Finnish refugee assigned to him by the Admiralty, attempts to assassinate the Tsar at a court function. After Russia enters the war, Hornblower's squadron takes an important role in the defence of Riga, which is besieged by French forces. The bomb vessels again take an important role, and so do amphibious operations under the protection of the squadron. The siege is finally broken, and Hornblower negotiates the defection of Prussian troops forced to accompany Napoleon's army into Russia. At this point it becomes clear to the accompanying Brown that Hornblower is gravely ill, apparently with typhus. In some editions of the novel the story ends here with the hallucinating Hornblower imagining himself being greeted in Hampton Court by Lady Barbara and his infant son. C.S. Forester however provided an additional chapter in which the convalescent Hornblower returns safely to Smallbridge in time for Christmas. During the siege and pursuit, Carl von Clausewitz, a German officer in Russian service, who is later to become famous as a military theorist and writer, is a character. Discussion The novel was first published as a serial in the Saturday Evening Post, and occasioned controversy with Hornblower in an implied sexual encounter with a married Russian Countess as the Post's first adulterers. As Forester says in his Hornblower Companion, \\"...it really caused quite a flutter\\". Forester wanted to give Hornblower the opportunity to catch typhus, although he does comment that he believes that Hornblower caught typhus during the siege rather than in bed. The historical accuracy of this book is limited: Forester later wrote that he did not know what British naval forces, if any, were engaged at the siege of Riga. (Historically they were commanded by Thomas Byam Martin.) The technical detail of the bomb vessels is incorrect in almost every respect. British bomb vessels had not been ketch-rigged since the 1780s; the mortars were crewed not by the bomb-vessels' officers and men but by specialist detachments of the Royal Marine Artillery; and many other points. Ivan Essen is presented as the governor of Riga throughout the campaign, but he was actually replaced by Filippo Paulucci delle Roncole a few months before victory was achieved. The date of publication (1945) reveals Forester's preoccupation in The Commodore-- he parallels the political situation with that in the Second World War. In both cases, Russia was originally allied with a continental dictator (Hitler/Napoleon) but changed sides after being treacherously invaded. In both cases, Sweden remained neutral and traded with both sides. Russia similarly occupied other Baltic territories (Finland, Lithuania etc.) raising doubts about the correct response among the British government. In The Commodore (but not in the real Napoleonic period), as in the Second World War, the Royal Navy offered substantial help to Russia: at the siege of Riga, and by guarding the Arctic convoys. Less obviously, Forester draws parallels between the early 19th century and his own time in one or two of the other Hornblower novels.

It is found in most Cuban genres, for example son and son montuno, rumba, cha-cha-ch√°, timba, and many more. Origins The practice of call and response singing probably stems from traditional African music and was brought to Cuba by slaves. It can still be found in its ancient form in Cuban religious music. Vocal improvisations are also based on market vendors' chants, called preg√≥n. Preg√≥n The lead singer usually improvises both melody and lyrics (although most singers have some standard lines which they use quite frequently). This is called gu√≠a or preg√≥n. The term preg√≥n also refers to a vocal improvisation without coro, and a genre in which such vocal improvisation is very important. The main language for gu√≠as is Spanish, but other languages like Bant√∫, Dahome, Lukum√≠ and Congolese are sometimes featured as well, either for complete gu√≠as or as single words within a Spanish gu√≠a. In timba music, English and Spanglish are sometimes used as a special effect. Many singers have a special word or phrase that they insert into their improvisation as a trademark. The most famous example is Celia Cruz's \\"¬°Az√∫car!\\" (\\"Sugar!\\") or another being Antony Santos' \\"¬°El Mayimbe Otra Vez!\\". In timba and other more recent styles, the preg√≥n is sometimes replaced by a rap section. Coro The coro has fixed melody and lyrics. These can change during a piece, though, and are often made up on-the-fly, but within one section, they are repeated unchanged. Coros are usually homophonic, but not necessarily in unison. Most coros feature two or three parts, rarely more, moving in parallel lines. The parts may or may not be doubled, according to the artist's preference and possibilities. Some genres like rumba prefer a more massive coro sound and double parts whenever possible, while other genres like salsa dura prefer the clean sound of a small coro. The lyrics are generally based on the theme of the song (called the son); frequently the coro resolves the tension built up in the theme, or gives a new twist to it. The coro can also be based on the main idea of the theme, or a part of the theme's lyrics. Singing coro requires great accuracy, both rhythmically and harmonically. The coro singer's function in a band is more like an instrumentalist's than a singer's. Function Coro-preg√≥n forms the framework of the montuno section in most of the genres using it. It alternates with mambo (also known as mo√±a) sections, instrumental solos, percussion breaks and, depending on genre, other sections. In traditional genres, changing the coro requires changing the mambo, and vv. A coro-preg√≥n section traditionally starts and ends with a coro, although certain situations may require an exception. There are several ways of introducing the first coro-preg√≥n section: *Start directly from the theme. Often, the coro is the last line of the theme, and will introduce itself. *Instrumental estribillo or break. The theme ends with a short instrumental break or estribillo, which introduces the coro. *Solo-coro. Instead of the lead singer, an instrumentalist (typically a trumpetist) takes a few solos to get the montuno going. After that, the gu√≠as are enforced by adding the campana bell. Some songs do not have a (vocal) theme but rather contain only coro-preg√≥n. This form is often found in genres like montuno and descarga. Similarly, the danz√≥n-ch√° (derived from danz√≥n often features an instrumental theme (the danz√≥n), followed by a montuno section (the ch√° or cha-cha-ch√°) with coro-preg√≥n. Timba music and other related genres also employ a breakdown of the rhythm section while the coro-preg√≥n and the piano continue. This effect is also called timba, sometimes \\"presi√≥n\\".

A blaze in the beginning meant \\"a mark made on a tree by slashing the bark\\" (The Canadian Oxford Dictionary). Originally a waymark was \\"any conspicuous object which serves as a guide to travellers; a landmark\\" (Oxford English Dictionary). There are several ways of marking trails: paint, carvings, affixed markers, posts, flagging, cairns, and crosses, with paint being the most widely used. Types of signage =Paint= Painted marker in SwitzerlandA painted marking of a consistent shape or shapes (often rectangular), dimension and colour or combination of colours is used along the trail route. The system by which blazes are used to signify turns and endpoints in trails (see below) strongly favors the use of paint blazes. Basic Marker ‚Äì red, used in Central Europe for difficult or summit trails European countries usually use systems of painted bars or shapes in more than one colour. The Central European Hiking Markers System uses three bars - usually one color in between two white bars, with different meanings attached to different colours - in a 10 cm x 10 cm square. Red is often used to mark difficult or summit trails. Arrows of similar design signal a change of direction. Originally created in Czechoslovakia, this system is used in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia, Bosnia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Georgia, Brazil and other countries. French, Italian, Austrian and Swiss trails use a similar system of white and coloured stripes. In the United States and Canada, a single colour is used, usually white, red, blue or yellow. Trails in South Africa are often marked by yellow footprints painted on trees and rocks. Blazes may also be painted on obvious rock surfaces or on posts set into the ground (or on utility poles, fences, or other handy surfaces) where the trail follows a road or goes through fields and meadows. =Carvings= Carved marker ‚Äì wooden marker using a stylized thistle to mark the Southern Upland Way, Scotlandin North America, Australia and New Zealand, there are trails blazed by cuts made in bark by axe or knife, usually the former. Most often these are informal routes made by loggers or hunters, or trails descended from those routes. Originally a tree would be blazed by hatchet chops (still the dictionary definition) but today other methods have become more common, with environmental and aesthetic concerns sometimes playing a part in the choice of blazing method. Other navigational aids, such as cairns, are used where blazes are unsuitable. In 1902 the miners of Idaho created and marked the Three Blaze \\"shortcut\\" Trail with a series of three distinctive blazes cut on the trees, usually with an axe, to define the specific route to the Thunder Mountain Mines of Central Idaho. =Affixed markers= NZ) Alternatively, more long lasting plastic, metal or even sometimes wooden markers may be affixed to trees, usually with nails. The placement of these markers requires more skill and labor than paint, as well as an area with an abundant supply of trees to which to attach them. =Flagging= Flag marker ‚Äì a rare use of a tape flag as a blaze on an official trail in the US, here indicating where the trail re- enters the woods after crossing an open ledge Surveyor's tape hung from branches or tied around trees is sometimes used to indicate trail routes, but usually only for temporary or unofficial trails, most commonly when a trail route has been selected but the trail itself is under construction. Flags are sometimes used for permanent trails, but they are the most vulnerable to the elements of any trail blazing method and may be more difficult to see. Trail flagging is the predominant method to mark a mountain hiking trail in Japan. Red ribbons usually indicate an ascent route while yellow ribbon indicate a descent route. On some mountains, a non-standard ribbon colour (white or blue) is used to identify a specific trail. =Poles= Pole marker on an Alpine route at Piz Uccello, Switzerland Poles, colored or not, are often used to keep the trail visible during winter and under snow cover. Poles are standard trail markers in Austria, Canada, USA, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Slovakia. =Cairns= Inuksuit - a cairn in northern Canada were markers used for wayfinding and to locate caches of food or other stores. Cairns are carefully arranged piles of stones. Cairns are most commonly used to indicate trails in open areas, such as higher-elevation alpine areas, where no trees are available, or where conditions may make blazes hard to see. An ancient example is the inuksuk (plural inuksuit), used by the Inuit, Inupiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America. These structures are found from Alaska to Greenland. This region, above the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks. Below the tree line, cairns are used less frequently, often like flagging to indicate informal or unofficial paths or just their junctions with official trails. They may become obscured by snow in areas with heavy winters and may be easily knocked over. In some areas the recreational building of numerous cairns has obscured the proper use of cairns to mark junctions and crossings. In some areas of the United States, park rangers and land managers must disassemble excess cairns when they become eyesores or when they mislead navigation. Where rocks are scarce poles can be used. Poles are also frequently used to mark ski and snow shoe trails. Trail ducks Duck is a term used in some parts of the US, generally for a much smaller rock pile than a cairn, typically stacked just high enough to convince the observer it is not natural. For most, two rocks stacked could be a coincidence, but three rocks stacked is a duck. In some regions, ducks also contain a pointer rock (or a couple of stacked rocks) to indicate the direction of the trail. =Crosses= A wayside cross is a cross by a footpath, track or road, at an intersection, along the edge of a field or in a forest, which often serve as waymarks for walkers and pilgrims or designate dangerous places. They are particularly common in Europe, for example in Germany, Galicia and the Alps. It can be made of wood, stone or metal. Most wayside crosses are designed as crucifixes. Prominence In US wilderness areas, whether state or federal, the US Wilderness Act requires that the land seems \\"untrammeled by man,\\" and so blazes are often kept to a minimum. By contrast, in a typical municipal, county, or state park, or any land open to a wide variety of users, or in a well-developed metropolitan area, blazes will be more frequent. Single-track hiking trails also receive more blazes than those that follow old roads or other more obvious routes. Systems A National Cycle Network (NCN) milepost in Scotland On a large piece of land, there is likely to be more than one trail. While it might seem obvious that, at minimum, trails should at least take different colours, this is not always done. In Mount Greylock State Reservation, which contains the highest mountain in Massachusetts, all trails other than the Appalachian Trail use the same blue blaze. Blaze type might also be mixed when different user groups (i.e., snowmobilers, horse riders, mountain bikers) are allowed on trails. For users of faster vehicles, blazes are often larger in order to be seen better at high speeds, and sometimes affixed markers best communicate who may and may not use a trail besides those on foot. Another possible distinction is by season. In Norway, it is common to use blue for summer routes and red for winter routes. Red routes may traverse lakes and swamps, which are flat and well suited for cross-country skiing in winter, but impassable on foot in summer. Colours are often assigned simply with an eye toward making sure that no two trails that intersect use the same one, but it can go further than that. On all state land in New York's Catskill Park, for instance, primary trails, especially longer \\"trunk trails\\" that go great distances, use red markers if they go in a generally east‚Äìwest direction and blue if they go north‚Äìsouth. Shorter spur, loop or connector trails generally use yellow blazes. On occasions when two trails run concurrently, usually at a slightly staggered junction, only one trail may be signed, often with the longer or more heavily trafficked trail's blaze predominating. In other cases, such as southern Vermont where the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail follow the same path, both trails may use the same white blaze. A quite different blazing system, called mute blazes was created in the Czech part of Krkono≈°e. The blazes, cut out of sheet metal and painted red, are suspended on high poles, thus being visible to both hikers and skiers. Unlike in classic systems, they do not refer to paths or trails, but show the way to the nearest mountain huts and adjacent towns and villages with the possibility of overnighting and catering. National Trails in England and Wales generally use an acorn symbol. The National Cycle Network in the United Kingdom is signposted using a white bicycle symbol on a blue background, with a white route number in an inset box, but with no destination names or distances. National Route numbers have a red background, Regional Route numbers have a blue background. The system of symbols is based on that used by the Danish National Cycle Route network. The colour used may also indicate the status of the route, for example on rights of way in England and Wales yellow marks are used for footpaths, blue for bridleways, and red for byways open to all traffic. Meaning of trail signs Symbols commonly used in trail blazing in the United States. Turn signals are often non-directional--one blaze is placed directly above the other. In addition to reassuring the trail user that they are on the trail, the signage can alert them to imminent turns, particularly if there is some confusion about what might be the trail, and where trails begin and end. Harriman State Park in the USA Offset blazes is a system whereby a vertically stacked pair of blazes with the upper one offset in the direction that the trail turns. This system was first used in 1970 on the Beech Trail in Harriman State Park. This system was further refined to where a triangular pattern of blazes would indicate a terminus, its point up or down depending on whether that was the beginning or the end. These began to be used elsewhere and are now fairly common throughout North America, though variations of this system exist. Some trails instead use two blazes painted together at an angle to form an \\"L\\" shape to indicate a turn, with the angle between the two blazes indicating the angle and direction of the turn. Also, a few trails indicate turns with two stacked blazes, without an offset, but this can cause confusion as the direction is not implied. In addition, other trails may use two non-offset stacked blazes to indicate the trail goes straight at a location where there may be a tempting mis-turn. A triangular pattern with its point to the side was also devised for eventualities like spurs or junctions, but these have not caught on. In some areas, a triangular pattern with its point up indicates that a hiker is at the point of a sharp switchback. In the Netherlands, signage usually consist of two bars above each other: white-red, yellow-red and red-blue are commonly seen blazes. An upcoming turn is indicated by duplicating the blazes: white-red-white-red, yellow-red-yellow- red, etc. Nowadays, stickers are often used, and instead of duplicating the blaze, the rectangle is cut into an arrow, to indicate direction. A diagonal cross is used to indicate a direction should not be taken: the cross will have the same colours as the blazes (each bar will use a different colour).

S. Forester. In 1814, Hornblower is delegated to deal with the Flame, a brig full of mutineers off the French coast, near the mouth of the Seine. It is a tricky situation because the mutineers' demands cannot be met, but they have threatened that if a Royal Navy force tries to force their hand, they will slip into a nearby French port. Plot summary Hornblower alters the appearance of his own vessel, the Porta Coeli, so it can masquerade as the mutinous vessel. As dusk falls, he follows a valuable blockade runner into port, pretending to be the Flame. Then, once the two vessels are moored, he captures it and takes it out to sea. He then pursues the Flame, which retreats to the French port. Believing the mutineers responsible, the French send four gunboats to take her. Hornblower manages to exploit the fighting to capture both the Flame and a gunboat. Seine River Among the French prisoners is Lebrun, the young and ambitious assistant to the mayor of Le Havre. Lebrun asks to speak with Hornblower privately; he proposes to surrender Le Havre to the English fleet. Hornblower and Lebrun arrange a plan: Lebrun's role is to undermine those parties who would resist a British seizure of the city. Overcoming some tense moments with audacity, Hornblower is able to capture the city with a half battalion of Royal Marines and finds himself its military governor. Hornblower finds his new duties different from that of commanding a naval vessel or squadron. He finds his role demanding, in part because he is such a demanding perfectionist. The Duke of Angoul√™me, one of the heirs to the Bourbon dynasty, is sent to assume control of the civil leadership. Hornblower hears that Napoleon has been able to amass a strong force, to be transported by barge down the Seine to retake Le Havre. He sends a force, borne by half a dozen large ship's boats, to try to blow up the barges and ammunition. He puts his best friend, Captain William Bush, in command. The raid is a success and the French force is stopped, but an unexpected explosion kills most of the British, including Bush. Hornblower is raised to the peerage, possibly in part to provide him with more dignity, gravitas, when dealing with the French heir's entourage, as well to reward him for his accomplishments. During the following peace, Hornblower's wife Barbara accompanies her brother, the Duke of Wellington, to the Congress of Vienna, leaving Hornblower at loose ends. He decides to visit the Comte de Gracay, where he resumes his relationship with the Comte's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie. When Napoleon escapes from Elba and raises a new army, Hornblower, the Comte and Marie lead a guerrilla fight against the Imperial forces. They are eventually defeated, and Marie dies from a leg wound. Hornblower and the Comte are captured and condemned to death, but news of the Emperor's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo arrives just in time to save their lives.

Lineage  William FitzRobert was the son of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of King Henry I of England, during whose reign William was born. Thus William was a nephew of the Empress Maud and a cousin of King Stephen, the principal combatants of the English Anarchy period. It also meant that William is the great-grandson of the famed William the Conqueror.  Early career  In October 1141, William looked after the Baronial estates, when his father fell into the hands of partisans at Winchester. His father was exchanged for King Stephen, and during his father's absence in Normandy in 1144 he served as Governor of Wareham. In 1147, he overthrew Henry de Tracy at Castle Cary. In 1154 he made an alliance with Roger de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford, by which they agreed to aid each other against all men except Henry II of England. FitzRobert granted Neath, a town in Glamorgan, a charter. He was Lord of the manor of Glamorgan, as well as Caerleon, residing chiefly at Cardiff Castle. It was there that in 1158 he and his wife and son were captured by the Welsh Lord of Senghenydd, Ifor Bach (\\"Ivor the Little\\") and carried away into the woods, where they were held as prisoners until the Earl redressed Ivor's grievances.  Relationship with King Henry II In 1173 the earl took the King's part against his sons, but thereafter he appears to have fallen under suspicion, for the following year he submitted to the King, and in 1175 surrendered to him Bristol Castle. Because his only son and heir Robert died in 1166, Earl William made John, the younger son of King Henry II, heir to his earldom, in conformity with the King's promise that John should marry one of the Earl's daughters, if the Church would allow it, they being related in the third degree. Earl William was present in March 1177 when the King arbitrated between the Kings of Castile and Navarre, and in 1178, he witnessed Henry's charter to Waltham Abbey. But during the King's struggles with his sons, when he imprisoned a number of magnates of whose loyalty he was doubtful, Earl William was among them. Family and children He was married to Hawise de Beaumont of Leicester, daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester and Amica de Gael and had children: # Robert fitz William (1151, Cardiff, Glamorganshire - 1166, Cardiff, Glamorganshire). # Mabel fitz William, married Amaury V de Montfort, her son Amaury briefly being Earl of Gloucester # Amice fitz William, d. 1220. Married Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford, their descendants eventually inherited the Earldom of Gloucester. # Isabel, Countess of Gloucester. She was married three times: ## John of England ## Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex, Earl of Gloucester ## Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent The earl died in 1183; his wife Hawise survived him. Since their only son, Robert, predeceased his father, their daughters became co-heirs to the feudal barony of Gloucester.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 1994. In the episode, Abe Simpson falls in love with Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier, and they start dating. However, on a night out in town, she is charmed by Mr. Burns. Abe is broken hearted when he learns that Jacqueline is going to marry Mr. Burns. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. It was recorded in October 1993 at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles. The episode features cultural references to films such as The Gold Rush and The Graduate, and songs such as \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" and \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\". Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.0, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot The Simpson family gathers to celebrate Maggie's birthday. After the party, Grampa feels depressed, so Marge sets him up for a date with her mother, Jacqueline. Eventually, the couple falls in love, which enrages Homer, who believes that old people should not date each other ‚Äî especially in-laws ‚Äî and fears that his children will become \\"freaks\\" if the two decide to marry. To impress Jacqueline, Grampa takes her out dancing, but when he does, Mr. Burns steals her from him and breaks his heart. Burns declares that he is in love with Jacqueline, and they are going to get married, against Marge's interest. Meanwhile, Bart buys a $350 Itchy & Scratchy animation cel with one of Homer's credit cards. In order to pay Homer back, Bart blackmails Burns by threatening to ruin his suit before his date. On the day of the wedding, Grampa crashes Burns' and Jacqueline's wedding ceremony and asks that Jacqueline marry him instead. Partly due to Burns' boorish behavior, she decides not to marry either man. Deciding that Jacqueline's decision is good enough for him, Grampa grabs her and they run out of the church and onto on a bus, leaving Burns heartbroken. On the bus, the two sit silently, contemplating what will happen between them now, before Grampa yells at bus driver Otto to turn the music off. After being rebuffed, Grampa talks over the song and credits about why he loves Jacqueline, before being cut off by the Gracie Films logo. Production alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The episode was inspired by the fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long. The episode was recorded at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where the cast and crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was \\"genuine hearty laughter at various points\\" during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: \\"At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements.\\" Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the \\"astounding versatility\\" of the actors became clear; \\"Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities.\\" Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with \\"gravelly voices\\". Cultural references Grampa is hassled by lawyers who claim that he is imitating Jimmy Durante. The episode's title is a play on the 1928 D. H. Lawrence novel Lady Chatterley's Lover. Grampa is hassled twice by lawyers representing the estates of deceased entertainers: the first representing Charlie Chaplin, for his \\"unauthorized imitation\\" of the bread roll dancing scene from the 1925 silent film The Gold Rush, and the second for imitating Jimmy Durante. Grampa banging on the church window while shouting \\"Mrs. Bouvier!\\", and the subsequent getaway on the bus, are references to the film The Graduate, as is the closing song, a parody of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" by Simon and Garfunkel. Mrs. Bouvier says her friends, Zelda Fitzgerald, Frances Farmer and Sylvia Plath, were jealous of her good looks and it drove them crazy. All three women were known for having been institutionalized, Fitzgerald and Farmer for schizophrenia and Plath for a breakdown that resulted in suicide. Mrs. Bouvier's favorite tune‚Äîplayed during the dance at the Springfield Community Center and later by Grampa at the wedding‚Äîis Glenn Miller's song \\"Moonlight Serenade\\". The swing tune played during Mrs. Bouvier and Mr. Burns's dance is the 1936 song \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\", written by Louis Prima and performed by Benny Goodman.. Bart and Lisa sing the 1960s advertising jingle used for Armour and Company's brand of hot dogs. Everyone, except Lisa, then sings the advertising jingle for Chicken Tonight, complete with chicken dance moves. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" finished 50th in the ratings for the week of May 9 to May 15, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 10.0. The episode was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a \\"generally good program, though not one of the year‚Äôs best\\". Jacobson said he dislikes Marge's mother; \\"she‚Äôs one of the series‚Äô less interesting characters, which is probably why she appears so rarely.\\" However, he thinks Grampa is \\"always fun\\", and \\"it‚Äôs nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while.\\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B‚àí grade and said he is \\"never terribly interested in episodes that revolve around [Grampa] Simpson\\". He believes Grampa is \\"great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage\\". He added: \\"I'm also especially uninterested in episodes revolving around Marge's mother. Having said that, this episode does have a number of inspired moments‚Äînotably the subplot involving Bart's pursuit of an Itchy & Scratchy cel, as well as one of the series' many homages to The Graduate.\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"Homer's nightmare vision of Bart, Lisa and Maggie as ordinary kids is a highlight of this especially crazy‚Äîsurreal jokes, flashbacks and dream sequences whizz by at an alarming rate‚Äîinstallment.\\" References External links *\\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" at The Simpsons.com  The Simpsons (season 5) episodes 1994 American television episodes ","title":"Lady Bouvier's Lover"},{"id":"1789981","text":"Alojz Knafelc in the 1920s The Knafelc blaze Alojz Knafelc (23 June 1859 ‚Äì 26 April 1937) was a Slovene cartographer, mountaineer and the inventor of the Slovene trail blaze.

Maniatis carried out postdoctoral studies with Professor Mark Ptashne at Harvard University and with Dr. Fred Sanger at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. Maniatis has held faculty positions at Harvard University, The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the California Institute of Technology, and Columbia University. As a postdoctoral fellow with Mark Ptashne at Harvard University, Maniatis studied the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation in bacteriophage lambda. He identified multiple bacteriophage lambda repressor binding sites in the operators of the virus, and determined their DNA sequences while working in Fred Sanger's lab at the MRC in Cambridge, England. Maniatis was appointed to the position of assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 1975, but carried out his research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory because the moratorium on recombinant DNA research in Cambridge, MA prevented his work on cDNA cloning at Harvard. In 1977, Maniatis moved to the California Institute of Technology, where his laboratory generated the first human genomic DNA library, and cloned the human beta-globin gene cluster. In 1981 Maniatis returned to Harvard where he applied molecular cloning methods to the study of the mechanisms of RNA transcription and splicing in eukaryotes. Maniatis moved to Columbia University in 2009 where he serves as the Isidore Edelman Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. His laboratory currently studies the role of single cell diversity in brain wiring, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). In 1982, Maniatis, along with Joe Sambrook and Edward Fritsch, wrote Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, which made the newly emerging gene cloning technology accessible to a wide range of disciplines in the life sciences.

The main source of information on St Edmund is a contemporary account written by an eyewitness and published a short time after his death. This document, conforming to the ancient style of the \\"Acts of martyrs\\" includes the story of the execution of another 17th-century Recusant martyr, Richard Herst. Life Bryan Arrowsmith was born at Haydock, Lancashire, England, in 1585, the eldest child of Robert Arrowsmith, a yeoman farmer, who had served in Sir William Stanley‚Äôs regiment which fought for Spain in the Low Countries. His mother was Margery Gerard, a member of the Lancashire Gerard family. Among his mother's relations was Father John Gerard, who wrote The Diary of an Elizabethan Priest, as well as another martyr, the Blessed Miles Gerard. He was baptised Brian, but always used his confirmation name of Edmund, after an uncle who trained English priests in France. The family was constantly harassed for its adherence to Roman Catholicism. One of his grandfathers died a confessor in prison. On one occasion, as a child, he was left shivering in his night-clothes by the pursuivants, who carried his parents off to Lancaster jail; he and his three siblings were cared for by neighbours.Ryan, Patrick W.F. \\"Ven. Edmund Arrowsmith.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 17 February 2018 Education In 1605, at the age of twenty, Edmund left England and went to the English College, Douai, to study for the priesthood. He was soon forced to return to England due to ill health, but recovered and returned to Douai in 1607. Ecclesiastical career He was ordained in Arras on 9 December 1612, and sent on the English mission a year later. He ministered to the Catholics of Lancashire without incident until around 1622, when he was arrested and questioned by the Anglican Bishop of Chester. Edmund was released when King James I of England ordered an amnesty for all arrested priests, in furtherance of negotiations to arrange a Spanish marriage for his son Prince Charles. Arrowsmith joined the Jesuits in 1624. In the summer of 1628, Fr. Edmund was reportedly betrayed by a man named Holden, who denounced him to the authorities. Arrowsmith ministered to Catholics of Lancashire at the still-standing Arrowsmith House, located in Hoghton before being arrested and questioned on Brindle Moss where his horse refused to jump a ditch. He was convicted of being a Roman Catholic priest in England. He was sentenced to death, and hanged, drawn and quartered at Lancaster on 28 August 1628. His final confession was heard by Saint John Southworth, who was imprisoned along with Edmund. Veneration Edmund Arrowsmith's beatification occurred in 1929. He was canonized as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales by Pope Paul VI in 1970. His feast days are 28 August alone and 25 October with 39 others. His hand was preserved and kept by the Arrowsmith family as a relic until he was beatified and it now rests in the Catholic Church of St Oswald and St Edmund Arrowsmith, Ashton-in-Makerfield. Stonyhurst College retains the small trunk of vestments and equipment which he carried from house to house. Lancaster Cathedral celebrates St Edmund as one of the Lancashire Martyrs, whose feast is kept throughout the diocese on 7 August each year.

Prior to arriving at the name, Crowley referred to the house as Villa Santa Barbara.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 185. Objectives This idealistic utopia was to be the model of Crowley's commune, while also being a type of magical school, giving it the designation \\"Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum\\", A College towards the Holy Spirit. The general program was in line with the A‚à¥A‚à¥ course of training, and included daily adorations to the sun, a study of Crowley's writings, regular yogic and ritual practices (which were to be recorded), as well as general domestic labor. The object was for students to devote themselves to the Great Work of discovering and manifesting their True Will. Crowley had planned to transform the small house into a global center of magical devotion and perhaps to gain tuition fees paid by acolytes seeking training in the Magical Arts; these fees would further assist him in his efforts to promulgate Thelema and publish his manuscripts. Raoul Loveday Raoul Loveday, who died at the Abbey in 1923 In 1923, a 23-year-old Oxford undergraduate, Raoul Loveday (or Frederick Charles Loveday), died at the Abbey. His wife, Betty May, variously blamed the death on his participation in one of Crowley's rituals (allegedly incorporating the consumption of the blood of a sacrificed cat) or the more probable diagnosis of acute enteric fever contracted by drinking from a mountain spring. Crowley had warned the couple against drinking the water, as reported in biographies by Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski and others. When May returned to London, she gave an interview to a tabloid paper, The Sunday Express, which included her story in its ongoing attacks on Crowley. With these and similar rumors about activities at the Abbey in mind, Benito Mussolini's government demanded that Crowley leave the country in 1923.The well-known Sicilian Novelist, Leonardo Sciascia, has an amusing short story about Crowley's expulsion from Sicily.

Written by Scott Kosar, it is based on the novel The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson and is a remake of the 1979 film from the same name. It is the ninth film in the Amityville Horror film series, which documents the experiences of the Lutz family after they move into a house at 112 Ocean Avenue, Long Island. In 1974, real-life mass murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. killed six members of his family at 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York. The film was released in the United States on April 15, 2005, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Dimension Films. The film received negative reviews from critics, with many feeling it didn't deliver anything new and calling it derivative to the original film. It grossed $108 million on a $19 million budget. Plot In November 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdered his family at their house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York. He claimed that he was persuaded to kill them by voices he heard in the house. One year later, married couple George and Kathy Lutz move into the house along with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage, Billy, Michael, and Chelsea. The family soon begins experiencing paranormal events in the house. Chelsea claims that she has befriended a girl named Jodie, a name belonging to one of the murdered DeFeo children. One night the couple decide to go out, and they hire a babysitter to watch the three kids. When the babysitter, Lisa, arrives, they come to find out that she had previously been hired to babysit for the DeFeos. Lisa tells them about the murders that took place in their house. When she goes to Chelsea's room, Chelsea tells her that she is a bad babysitter, claiming that Jodie told her so. Lisa begins to scold Jodie for being the reason behind her getting fired. Then Billy dares Lisa to go inside the closet (the same closet where Jodie was murdered), and she gets locked inside. After a few seconds she encounters Jodie herself, and begs to be let out. She goes into shock and the paramedics arrive to take her away; on the way to the hospital, Lisa tells Kathy that she had seen Jodie. George's behavior towards Kathy and her children becomes abusive and the paranormal activity continues. One night, George hears Harry barking in the boathouse. Seemingly possessed, he grabs the axe and proceeds to murder the family dog. The children look for Harry the next day, with George denying he knows where he is, despite Billy's suspicions. Kathy asks priest Father Callaway (Philip Baker Hall) to bless the house, as a protective measure to prevent any future paranormal incidents, but Father Callaway flees the house when he encounters such occurrences himself. Kathy discovers that the house once belonged to a cult preacher named Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham, whose evil actions towards Native Americans during his \\"mission\\" in 17th century Amityville are said to be the cause of the haunting at 112 Ocean Avenue. Meanwhile, George, as he is walking through the basement of the house, encounters the apparitions of the various Native Americans who were tortured and killed there by Ketcham centuries ago. Entering a dimly-lit room, George encounters Ketcham himself (though he is not aware of who he is), and the ghostly figure of the evil missionary turns around, picks up a knife, and slits his throat in an act of recreating his suicide, covering George with blood, and causing him to become nearly completely possessed. Kathy becomes convinced that George's abusive behavior is owed to a spiritual possession. Following urgent advice from Father Callaway, Kathy tries to evacuate her children from the house and escort them to safety, but the possessed George attempts to kill her and the children; Kathy knocks him out to prevent him from doing so and transports him away from the residence. Subsequently, George is released from the spirit's control and the family permanently leaves the house. A title card states that the family left within 28 days of arriving and never returned. Jodie is shown standing in the now empty house and screaming in terror while the house rearranges itself. Subsequently, she is pulled beneath the floor by a pair of disembodied hands.

The house used is a real 1800s home that was temporarily converted to add the famous \\"eye\\" windows. The house is in Salem at 27618 Silver Lake Road. The movie facade cost $60,000. After production the movie facade remained on the house for a while and was eventually carefully removed. The famous \\"evil eye\\" windows were preserved in sections of the walls which still have the movie bedroom wallpaper on the inside and siding with old looking movie paint on the outside. The windows were in good shape but were \\"aged\\" to match the house using peeling paint. In 2017 an estate sale was held at the movie mansion and the famous \\"eye\\" windows, which had been in the attic since filming, were sold. The buyer lives in the same neighborhood and has the windows on display. MGM claimed the remake was based on new information uncovered during research of the original events, but George Lutz later claimed nobody ever spoke to him or his family about the project. When he initially heard it was underway, his attorney contacted the studio to find out what they had in the planning stages and to express Lutz's belief they didn't have the right to proceed without his input. Three letters were sent and none was acknowledged. In June 2004, the studio filed a motion for declaratory relief in federal court, insisting they had the right to do a remake, and Lutz countersued, citing violations of the original contract that had continued through the years following the release of the first film. The case remained unresolved when Lutz died in May 2006. Release =Box office= The Amityville Horror opened on 3,323 screens in the United States on April 15, 2005 and earned $23,507,007 on its opening weekend, ranking first in the domestic box office. It eventually grossed $65,233,369 domestically and $42,813,762 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $108,047,131. =Critical reception= The film received negative reviews. It holds a 23% score on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 4.13/10. The site's consensus states: \\"A so-so remake of a so-so original.\\" Metacritic reports a 33 out of 100 rating, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \\"Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, the new Amityville marks a modest improvement over the original, partly because, from acting to bloody effects, it is better executed, and partly because the filmmakers have downgraded the role of the priest, played in all his vein-popping glory by Rod Steiger in the first film and by a considerably more subdued Philip Baker Hall here.\\"New York Times review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film one star and commented, \\"First-time director Andrew Douglas crams in every ghost clich√©, from demonic faces to dripping blood. This house springs so many FX shocks it plays like a theme-park ride. Result? It's not scary, just busy. For the real thing, watch Psycho . . . The Shining . . . The Haunting . . . or The Innocents . . . What all those films have in common is precisely what the new Amityville Horror lacks: They know it's what you don't see in a haunted house that fries your nerves to a frazzle.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle thought \\"the truly shocking thing about the new version is that it's not bloody awful . . . The decision to use minimal computer-generated effects, made for monetary rather than artistic reasons, works to Amityvilles advantage. It retains the cheesy look of the 1979 original, pure schlock not gussied up to appear to be anything else.\\" Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle stated the original film was \\"an effective little tingler whose frights are steady, implied, and cumulative . . . but in the remake the frights are such that you‚Äôre wondering why the stubborn Lutzes don‚Äôt flee after the first night. Obviously, the filmmakers were keen to remake this film exactly because the technological advances of the last 25 years now permit more graphic displays of horrific imaginings and computer enhancements that can render the invisible world visible. Strategically, the new Amityville never intended to go for the subtler, implied horror of the original; this one would be all about scaring the pants off viewers. And in this, the movie generally succeeds as sudden scares and flashes of yucky imagery cause audience members to yelp aloud as if on cue . . . The most irritating aspect of the new movie, however, has nothing to do with comparisons but rather with some of the inherent illogic of the story. Why are we seeing images of a hanged girl when we know she‚Äôs been shot in the head? Images seem to be grafted into the film that have little to do with the actual story. Maybe it‚Äôs a technique that succeeds within quick advertising spots, but it piles confusion onto the art of storytelling.\\" James Christopher of The Times observed, \\"There is something pleasurably batty about the way the family blunders on. The chills are satisfyingly creepy. The gory special effects are lavish and effective. And the wooden house itself is a sinister architectural pleasure. It‚Äôs total nonsense of course, but I left the lights on that night anyway.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD in separate widescreen and fullscreen editions on October 4, 2005. Bonus features include commentary by Reynolds and producers Form and Fuller; eight deleted scenes; On Set Peeks, a seamless branching feature with nine behind-the-scenes vignettes; Supernatural Homicide, with discussions about the murders that are the basis for the film with police and local residents; The Source of Evil, a behind- the-scenes look at the making of the film; and a photo gallery.

He committed suicide by taking an overdose of drugs.  Life and career  Erik was born in Bergen, Norway on December 23, 1969. In 1987 through 1988, he joined the band Hell Awaits. The band was inspired by Slayer and had a gig at the Kronstadt-Festival in 1988 in Bergen, the members were Yngve Eide (vocals), Finn Solemdal (guitars), Dag Nesb√∏ (bass) and Erik Br√∏dreskift (drums). The band broke up and Erik moved on to the Death/Thrash metal band Emptor. Their music was mainly inspired by the American band Sadus. Erik played drums on the demo, which was released in 1988. He used his birth name for his appearance in Emptor and Hell Awaits. After leaving Emptor in 1989, he took the stage name \\"Grim\\" and joined Immortal on the drums in 1993 right after they had recorded the Pure Holocaust album. He appeared on the cover and despite not playing on the album, was still credited. He played with Immortal two tours: ‚ÄúFuck Christ‚Äù Tour and ‚ÄúSons of the Northern Darkness‚Äù Tour, afterwards in 1994, Abbath and Demonaz decided that Erik had to leave the band, because he wasn't useful for the band's later career. In 1995, Grim was a founding member of the band Borknagar and played on the band's first three albums. In 1996 and 1997, he recorded the two albums The Last Tormentor and Under the Sign of Hell by Gorgoroth. Grim also played session drums on the never officially released album Nocturno Inferno in 1996. In 1997, he quit Gorgoroth and in 1998 he also left Borknagar, both due to personal reasons.  Death  Grim committed suicide on October 4th, 1999. He had attempted suicide several times, before finally succeeding with a sleeping-pill overdose. His funeral was held in M√∏llendal Church Cemetery, Hordaland County, Bergen. It is said that his reason for committing suicide was related to his departure from Immortal, as there was a rumor that Grim did not want to deal with it. As a tribute, Nargaroth wrote the song \\"Erik, May You Rape the Angels\\" for him, and Gorgoroth dedicated the album Incipit Satan to him. The first annual Hole in the Sky metal festival took place in Erik Br√∏dreskift's memory and was organised by his memorial fund.

The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. This novel constitutes the first of a five-novel circumnavigation of the globe; other novels in this voyage include The Nutmeg of Consolation, Clarissa Oakes/The Truelove, The Wine-Dark Sea, and The Commodore. Spain hears that England may be supporting the independence of its colonies in South America, while an envoy is needed in the Malay states to gain an ally for England. These two changes alter Aubrey's mission from his private man-of-war, Surprise en route to South America. They learn this at Lisbon, where Surprise parts company under Tom Pullings. Aubrey is reinstated on the Navy List in London and gains command of HMS Diane, carrying the envoy to negotiate a treaty with Pulo Prabang and Maturin gains a stay in a naturalist's paradise. Then the Diane is en route to a rendezvous with Surprise, when shoals and a typhoon challenge the Diane and her crew. Reviews of this novel follow the plot but are more properly reviews of the series to date, as W W Norton began publishing the series of novels in the US. Richard Snow, writing in The New York Times, said they were \\"the best historical novels ever written.\\" Many in the US took note of his article and sought out the novels. Writing about this novel, comments include that \\"the ultimate appeal of the Aubrey/Maturin adventures lies in O'Brian's delicious old-fashioned prose\\" that is \\"sketching with apparent accuracy and truth the early 19th-century world.\\" Another reviewer finds \\"There is a recklessness with plot that is intentionally subversive of the genre\\", while showing \\"a dazzling receptiveness to language, an understanding of period speech so entire\\". O'Brian's style has been compared to that of Jane Austen. As to this novel's plot, \\"the most charming segment is Maturin's idyllic stay in a remote valley, where he blissfully encounters and studies a variety of tame exotic beasts.\\" and \\"twists of plot are swift, drastic, on occasion comic,\\" and sometimes grotesque. Plot summary On land after ceasing his use of laudanum, Stephen Maturin finds he has changed; his naturally \\"ardent\\" temperament returns and alters his relationship with his wife Diana, who is now pregnant with their child. Maturin looks forward to the arrival of the child he is certain is a daughter. As the high level traitor in British intelligence is not yet identified, the time on land raises risks to his friend Jack Aubrey, who agrees to sail immediately. Aubrey, Maturin, and their shipmates prepare for a mission to sail the letter of marque Surprise on a mission to South America. Upon reaching Lisbon, Sir Joseph Blaine intercepts Maturin with news that he and Aubrey are required to carry a diplomat to the Sultan of Pulo Prabang, a piratical Malay state in the South China Sea. Edward Fox is the envoy leading the mission to persuade the Sultan to become an English rather than French ally. The French mission includes the same English traitors - Ledward and Wray - who were responsible for Aubrey's former disgrace. With the Surprise under the command of Captain Pullings, Aubrey and Maturin return with Blaine to England, where Lord Melville, First Lord of the Admiralty, reinstates Aubrey as a Post-Captain in the Royal Navy and gives him command of the recently captured French ship Diane. The voyage south forms the crew, with frequent training on the guns; by the luck of a timely breeze and much hard rowing in the ship's boats, Diane escapes the inshore currents of Inaccessible Island. Sailing through the high forties (south latitude), she first touches land at Java, meeting Lieutenant Governor Raffles near Batavia, where they hear the first word of bank failures in England. Arriving in Pulo Prabang, Maturin meets fellow natural philosopher van Buren and helps the arrogant envoy Fox plot against the French mission. During the leisurely negotiations with the Sultan, Maturin climbs the \\"Thousand Steps\\" to Kumai, a protected valley in the crater of a volcano and home to the orangutans he has been longing to see. Returning to town, he learns that Abdul, the Sultan's cupbearer and catamite has been caught in a compromising position with both Ledward and Wray. Abdul is executed and Ledward and Wray are banished from the court for their indiscretions, effectively ending the French mission. Wray and Ledward are eventually assassinated and Maturin and van Buren dissect their bodies. After a feast to celebrate the treaty, at which Fox and his retinue behave without discretion, the Diane makes for Batavia and to rendezvous with the Surprise. Fox behaves with increasing arrogance during the return voyage, the success of the treaty having gone to his head. After missing their rendezvous, the Diane sails toward Batavia, so Fox can sail to England on another ship. The frigate strikes a hidden reef and the ship cannot be floated again. They set up camp on a small island, but Fox insists on sailing in Diane's pinnace, rather than waiting until the ship is again afloat. He leaves Edwards aboard with an official duplicate of the treaty. A typhoon destroys the marooned Diane and Aubrey believes that the pinnace, if caught in the same storm, likely did not survive. With the situation growing desperate, Aubrey directs the men to build a vessel to get them to Batavia. Title The title refers to the honour, a thirteen-gun salute from the ship's guns, that is due to Fox as an official envoy and representative of the King.

In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the seventh of eleven novels (beginning with The Surgeon's Mate) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O'Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to The Far Side of the World, the tenth novel in this series). The events of The Yellow Admiral again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did. Continuity This story starts a few months after The Letter of Marque ends, with the Surprise ready for the South American voyage imagined at the time of her letter of marque. The crew aboard Surprise is unchanged, save for those men who use their prize money from the first cruise of the Surprise to set up inns or pubs, collectively called Aubrey's Arms. All but one of the high level spies appear in this novel, specifically Ledward and Wray, who had fled to France in The Letter of Marque and are now arrived in Pulo Prabang as part of Duplessis's mission, as Ledward can translate for Duplessis. After seeing Gough in the French privateer, Maturin reflects on his life since the rising in 1798, rereading old diaries that tell when he began his work with intelligence to the purposes of defeating Napoleon, supporting Irish independence and freeing Catalonia, after meeting Aubrey. Reviews The uneven pace of re-issues in the US is noted by Kirkus Reviews, who listed this thirteenth novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series after their own reviews of two books much earlier in the series (HMS Surprise and The Mauritius Command, third and fourth in the series respectively). Dr Stephen Maturin is described as \\"an intellectual counterpoint to Jack's more physical presence.\\" After a nod to the story, they conclude that \\"the ultimate appeal of the Aubrey/Maturin adventures lies in O'Brian's delicious old- fashioned prose, the wonderfully complex sentences that capture the feel of the sea and the culture of the great warships, all the while sketching with apparent accuracy and truth the early 19th-century world.\\" Publishers Weekly notes that Aubrey is once again a captain in the Royal Navy and \\"even a rotten-borough M.P.\\" Maturin's stay in the valley \\"where he blissfully encounters and studies a variety of tame exotic beasts\\" is called \\"charming\\". They mention that the author's writing style has been compared to that of Jane Austen, and praise the wit of guests at \\"the dinners (in country house, London, ship's mess, sultan's palace, Buddhist monastery)\\". Thomas Flanagan, writing in the New York Times Books was pleased to have discovered the series of novels by virtue of an essay by Richard Snow, \\"who roundly and with polemical extravagance declared them to be \\"the best historical novels ever written.\\" Not quite, perhaps.\\" adding that delayed appreciation of the series of novels \\"is not exclusively American. The British critic Peter Wishart has described the neglect of Patrick O'Brian as a literary wonder of the age, \\"as baffling as the Inca inability to invent the wheel.\\" Why all the fuss?\\" The writing style, structure, and plot are remarked favorably, including many incidents of The Thirteen Gun Salute: \\"The novels display a dazzling receptiveness to language, an understanding of period speech so entire that it never needs to preen itself -- although here and there it does. There is a recklessness with plot that is intentionally subversive of the genre. Climactic scenes are deliberately thrown away, revealed in casual conversation. The narrative pauses to digress on orangutans in Borneo, the cuisine of Portugal, a Mozart quartet. The twists of plot are swift, drastic, on occasion comic, on occasion grotesque: in this novel, Maturin's way of dealing with two English traitors at the Malay court of Pulo Prabang draws casually and lethally on his knowledge of zoology and his skill as an anatomist.\\" Flanagan concludes that \\"It is a pleasure to read a contemporary historical novel written not by machine but by hand. Regarding the re-issue of the entire series after publisher W W Norton became interested for the US market, Richard Snow wrote in 1991 that he had read the novels from Master and Commander to Desolation Island from American publishers twenty years earlier. O'Brian's \\"portrayal of life aboard a sailing ship is vivid and authoritative\\" and O'Brian presented \\"the lost arcana of that hard-pressed, cruel, courageous world with an immediacy that makes its workings both comprehensible and fascinating.\\" He noted too that \\"behind the humor, behind the storms and the broadside duels . . . loomed something larger: the shape and texture of a whole era.\\" As strong as the historical detail was, Snow remarked that \\"in the end it is the serious exploration of human character that gives the books their greatest power\\", and he also referred to the poetry of the writing, saying that O'Brian \\"manages to express, with the grace and economy of poetry, familiar things that somehow never get written down, as when he carefully details the rueful steps by which Stephen Maturin falls out of love.\\" At this time of the re-issues of the novels by W W Norton in the US, Snow recommended that a reader start with the first and keep reading to the last one, then \\"You will have read what I continue to believe are the best historical novels ever written.\\" Allusions to science and history On the voyage to Java, Jack has with him a chart showing Alexander von Humboldt's maximum and minimum sea- temperatures over a vast stretch of ocean.

For instruments, he takes on board the Surprise: *an improved dipping-needle *a very delicate hygrometer of Jack's own invention *an improved azimuth compass *a Geneva cyanograph *thermometers graduated by Ramsden Captain Aubrey's orders to HMS Diane are mentioned as occurring in the \\"fifty-third year\\" of the reign of King George III, thus fixing the year about 1813. The years of his reign began in October, and the story mentions the months of May, June and being in the austral winter after crossing the equator when sailing around Africa on HMS Diane; the author, as promised in the preface to the first book in the series, takes liberties with times of events. May of the 53rd year of the reign of George III might well be May 1814. O'Brian refers to these novels with no precise connection to actual years as 1812a, 1812b (see section above on series chronology). Due to the mental illness of the king, the 53rd year of George III's reign was also the third or fourth year of the Regency, which began in February 1811. The wreck of HMS Diane on an uncharted reef and the subsequent events may be based actual events surrounding the loss of the HMS Alceste. Under command of Capt Murray Maxwell, the ship wrecked on an uncharted reef in the Gaspar Straight in 1817. The crew abandoned the ship and made camp on a nearby island. Murray sent Ambassador Amherst on to Batavia in one of the ship's boats. While awaiting rescue, the crew repulsed an attack by a large group of what sources refer to as \\"Malay pirates\\" or \\"savages\\". Allusions to other literature Lois Montbertrand published an article concerning O'Brian's use of A. E. Housman's poem \\"Bells in the Tower\\" in this novel. She explains how O'Brian uses the fragment of the poem in the plot, as one character wants to get closer to Stephen Maturin, while Stephen Maturin would rather not.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1999. In the episode, Bart floods the school gymnasium and the schoolyard, which prompts the school's principal Seymour Skinner to diagnose Bart with ADHD. Bart is prescribed a psychostimulant drug called Focusyn (a parody of Ritalin), and initially starts paying more attention to his studies. After a while however, Bart starts turning psychotic and is convinced that Major League Baseball is watching over the people of Springfield. The episode was directed by director Mark Kirkland and was the first episode staff writer George Meyer received a sole writing credit for since the season 5 episode \\"Bart's Inner Child\\". Meyer, who was facing some psychological difficulties while writing the episode, felt so dissatisfied with the episode's first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym. The episode satirizes the perceived misdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children, which was a controversial topic at the time the episode was written. The episode's title is a parody of The Rolling Stones song \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", which was also written on the topic of psychological medication. The episode features former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire as himself. Following its broadcast, the episode was positively received by critics. In response to the episode, five months after the episode originally aired, United States president Bill Clinton held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health.  Plot  Principal Skinner holds a Fire Prevention site at the Springfield Elementary Schoolyard. Then a skit featuring Ned and Maude Flanders goes awry. Suddenly, a tidal wave bursts out, which Bart rides a basketball hoop on having flooded the gym, drenching the school yard and saving Ned with Bart laughing hysterically at this display. Furious at the mess Bart made, Skinner has Homer and Marge come to the school, where they learn Bart has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD). Principal Skinner tells Marge and Homer that Bart must take a radical, untested new behavioral medicine called Focusyn or he will have to expel him. After several failed attempts by Homer, Marge convinces Bart to take the medication and his behavior immediately improves, paying attention in school, being respectful to his parents, and tutoring a Navajo boy in his spare time. One night, however, Marge and Homer come home from a date to find Bart in his room wrapped in aluminum foil and coat hangers on the ceiling. Suffering from drug psychosis and paranoia, he claims Major League Baseball is spying on the town using a satellite. The doctors recommend that Bart go off Focusyn, but he refuses, swallows several handfuls of Focusyn and runs away. Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army base and manages to hijack a tank. He cuts a swath of destruction through the town and eventually stops at the school. There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family, due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.  Production  Former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire guest starred as himself in the episode. \\"Brother's Little Helper\\", which was originally called \\"Bart a Go Go\\", was written by staff writer George Meyer and directed by director Mark Kirkland. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1999. After the season 5 episode \\"Bart's Inner Child\\", Meyer got \\"a little burned out on writing scripts\\", so he wrote \\"Brother's Little Helper\\" in order to \\"try [his] hand again\\". While writing the episode, Meyer was going through \\"some psychological problems\\" and found the episode very difficult to write. He was initially so dissatisfied with the first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym; Vance Jericho. Co-producer Tim Long jokingly commented that the script was \\"literally moist with contempt\\" but went on to say that it was in fact \\"an amazing draft\\". The writers discussed what sort of rampage Bart would go on during the second act, and writer Matt Selman suggested that Bart obtain a tank. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Selman stated that he got the idea from watching a news report about \\"a guy\\" who had died while \\"[going] nuts with a tank\\". To show the side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens\\": a cheek line is added just under his eyes to suggest that he is starting to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with \\"mini-pupils\\". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, \\"several model sheets were going back and forth over the fax machines\\" until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely to cause pupils to become bigger (dilated). In the scene where he escapes the laboratory, Bart can be seen swallowing a handful of pills on his way out. Originally, Bart was supposed to \\"upend\\" an entire jar of Focusyn, but, according to Meyer, the censors wouldn't allow it. The scientists who prescribe Focusyn to Bart are based on one of The Simpsons' staff members and his wife. They were voiced by Hank Azaria and Tress MacNeille, respectively. Azaria also voiced Sir Widebottom, one of the clowns in Krusty's car, as well as one of the marine soldiers. Former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire guest starred as himself in the episode. Mike Scully, an executive producer and the show runner for the episode, commented that McGwire was \\"probably the biggest man [he'd] ever seen\\" and that he \\"did a great job for [them]\\".  Themes and cultural references  Focusyn, a fictional drug which is a spoof of Ritalin, (pictured) is prominently featured throughout the episode. According to Genevieve Koski, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Sean O'Neal, Kyle Ryan, and Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club, the '90s saw a \\"dramatic increase\\" in diagnoses of behavioral disorders, such as ADHD, in children, and debates over whether or not to medicate children with concentration difficulties were heated. Meyer, inspired by the debates, decided to write the episode to be about the subject. The episode criticizes how children with school issues are being misdiagnosed as having ADHD, as well as the prescription of psychostimulants to children in general. This in particular is shown in a scene in the Springfield Elementary schoolyard. In the scene, it is revealed that the general populace of the school is medicated for various misdiagnosed behavior disorders. Meyer himself was not entirely sure about his stance on the issue, however. He stated that \\"for all I know, the drugs help [the children] and help the world.\\" However, he went on to say that \\"I just have a feeling they're gonna be a disaster. Down the line.\\" Focusyn, the fictional psychoactive drug that is prominently featured throughout the episode, is based on the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which can be seen in the beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Other things referenced include the film Showgirls (1995), which Homer and Marge go to see. Homer says that, since taking Focusyn, Bart has gone \\"from Goofus to Gallant\\", a reference to the characters Goofus and Gallant from the children's magazine Highlights. When Lou sketches Bart based on Homer and Marge's description he ends up drawing Dennis from the comic strip Dennis the Menace. A shirt at the military base Fort Fragg reads \\"I Went to the Persian Gulf and All I Got Was This Lousy Syndrome\\", a reference to Gulf War syndrome. During Bart's rampage through the town in a tank, he sings the chorus of \\"Don't Stop\\" by Fleetwood Mac.  Reception  In its original American broadcast on October 3, 1999, \\"Brother's Little Helper\\" finished at no. 51 in the ratings, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched television program on Fox that night. Despite being the most watched program of the network, the ratings were considered disappointing by the Deseret News. On October 7, 2008, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Eleventh Season DVD box set. Mike Scully, George Meyer, Mark Kirkland, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman and Tim Long participated in the DVD audio commentary of the episode. Following its broadcast, \\"Brother's Little Helper\\" received positive reviews from critics. About nine years after its original broadcast, Robert Canning of IGN posted a \\"flashback review\\" of \\"Brother's Little Helper\\". Canning, calling the episode \\"funny\\" and \\"a standout episode in this later season\\", was particularly fond of the episode's opening. However, he was less impressed with the third act of the episode, calling it \\"lackluster\\". He felt that the part involving Mark McGwire was \\"a silly cop out\\" and that it wasn't as funny as what was leading up to it. He also stated that he was put off by the writers wanting to come across a message. \\"It's not that I necessarily disagreed with this sentiment\\", Canning wrote, \\"but at the time, I didn't think I needed to be taught a lesson while I watched The Simpsons. I still don't.\\" He did, however, \\"love\\" the \\"tag back\\" to the volunteer fire department seen in the beginning of the episode, and \\"the fact that they can't find how to fight a satellite fire in their handbook\\". In his review of The Simpsons - The Complete Eleventh Season, Brian Tallerico of The Deadbolt considered \\"Brother's Little Helper\\" to be one of the season's best episodes. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was favorable as well, calling the episode \\"pretty good\\" and that it \\"provides some good laughs\\". He especially liked seeing Bart well-behaved. He also appreciated the episode's message, writing that \\"the show offers a clever spotlight on [the] issue\\". He did, however, dislike the characterization of Bart. He wrote that Bart is normally \\"not particularly overactive or distractible\\", and that the writers \\"trie[d] to make [Bart] seem more hyper than normal\\". He concluded by saying that \\"Bart's a behavior problem but not ADHD.\\" Five months after the episode aired, Bill Clinton, who served as president of the United States at the time, held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health. Scripps Howard News Service columnist Deroy Murdock mentioned the timeliness of the conference in connection with the episode as being an instance of The Simpsons \\"clairvoyantly predict[ing] the news\\". In 2007, the fictional word \\"exorcism tongs\\" appeared in Cracked.com's list \\"From Cromulent to Craptacular: The Top 12 Simpsons Created Words\\", ranking in at number 10. The word is used in a scene in which Homer eats a mixture of taffy and Focusyn, which puts him in a \\"mildly hallucinogenic state\\". Seeing this, Todd Flanders asks his father, Ned, \\"Does Mr. Simpson have a demon, daddy?\\" To which Ned replies, \\"Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs.\\" About the word, Mark Peters and Daniel O' Brien of Cracked.com wrote \\"We'd be lying if we said we didn't go out to every Christian-themed general store in the country hoping to acquire our very own set of exorcism tongs the day this episode aired.\\"  References   External links  * \\"Brother's Little Helper\\" at The Simpsons.com The Simpsons (season 11) episodes 1999 American television episodes Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Television episodes about drugs ","title":"Brother's Little Helper"},{"id":"1790032","text":"John Sheepshanks by John Henry Foley, 1866, Victoria & Albert Museum John Sheepshanks (1787-1863), British manufacturer and art collector, was born in Leeds, and became a partner in his father's business as a cloth manufacturer.

The original facility debuted in 1975 and has undergone several significant expansions since opening. The VBC, in addition to the arena, features multiple exhibit halls, a concert hall, a playhouse and many other facilities, for meetings and exhibits. History It is named in honor of Wernher von Braun, the German-American rocket scientist. After von Braun‚Äôs work for Nazi Germany in World War II, he was brought to the United States Army's Redstone Arsenal along with many colleagues via Operation Paperclip. Their work laid the foundation for the United States space program. Planning for the facility began in 1965. The original construction included the sports arena, an exhibit hall space now known as East Hall, a concert hall, a playhouse, and museum space for the Huntsville Museum of Art. The arena as originally built seated about 8,000 for concerts, and included scoreboards and a refrigerated floor for ice events. The concert hall included an orchestra rehearsal room, dressing space for performers, and a lounge for patrons. The facility, originally referred to as the \\"Von Braun Civic Center\\", opened on March 14, 1975. The VBC's first expansion was a west-side addition to the exhibit hall, opened in 1980 and originally referred to as West Hall (the combined space is now called simply East Hall). Expanded kitchen facilities for catering were added in 1983. Originally this was a standalone building, but it became incorporated into the construction of North Hall in 1987. North Hall was constructed as a high-end exhibit and ballroom space, with carpeting and decorative lighting. A second-floor gallery can be opened to the main space or closed off, and it has a variety of meeting rooms and salons attached. In 1993 the city was bidding to host a meeting of the American Bowling Congress, which would require space for bowling lanes and exhibits for six months. In order to supply the space, the city agreed to the construction of South Hall, which opened in 1997. South Hall is the VBC's largest exhibit space at ; it includes a large lobby area, a partitionable ballroom, and an underground parking garage. Its construction involved eliminating a portion of Williams Avenue and re-routing part of Monroe Street. A sky walk connecting South Hall to a newly constructed adjacent hotel was added in 2006. The oldest portions of the facility underwent renovation in 2011. The improvements included new seating for the arena, reconstruction of the arena and concert hall lobbies, and a new exterior facade. Elvis Presley According to The Von Braun Center website, Elvis Presley appeared May 30 through June 1, 1975 for an unprecedented five performances. It was the first time Elvis had played that many consecutive performances in a venue outside of Las Vegas or Stateline, Nevada. Sports The VBC is the home of the UAH Chargers ice hockey team and the Huntsville Havoc of the Southern Professional Hockey League. Former sports teams at the VBC include the Huntsville Lasers and Huntsville Flight basketball teams, the Huntsville Blast and Huntsville Channel Cats ice hockey teams, the Huntsville Fire (EISL) soccer team, the Alabama Vipers arena football team, and the Alabama Hammers of the Professional Indoor Football League.. The arena at one time hosted public ice skating, and youth hockey and figure skating programs, but those activities have since been moved to another facility. On February 10, 2007, the Huntsville Havoc beat the Knoxville Ice Bears 7-6, in front of the largest crowd for a sporting event in the VBC's history, with 7,083 fans. It was the site of the first-ever Total Nonstop Action Wrestling card, which featured in- ring cameos by Toby Keith and Sterling Marlin. All Elite Wrestling (AEW) held their February 5, 2020 episode of AEW Dynamite at the arena. Entertainment and culture The arena has hosted numerous rock, pop, and country music concerts. The VBC Concert Hall has been the home venue for the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra since the facility opened in 1975. The concert hall also hosts the productions of the Broadway Theater League. The playhouse hosts the productions of Theatre Huntsville, the Fantasy Playhouse Children's Theater, and the Jim Parker Songwriters Series, as well as numerous community events. The yearly Panoply of the Arts outdoor festival takes place in Big Spring Park adjacent to the VBC. The VBC provided space for the Huntsville Museum of Art from its opening until 1998, when the museum moved to a nearby facility. The former museum is now used as office space for VBC staff. Expansion On October 23, 2008, it was announced that the VBC Arena would undergo a massive $15M renovation and would be renamed the Propst Arena, after the family that donated $5M to the city for the expansion. On Friday, February 5, 2010 a groundbreaking ceremony was held marking further renovations to what is now known as the Mark C. Smith Concert Hall.

Cap. (1577 - 1622) was a Capuchin friar who was a major figure in the Counter-Reformation, and was martyred by his opponents at Seewis im Pr√§ttigau, now part of Switzerland. Fidelis was canonized in 1746. Early life He was born Mark Roy or Rey in 1577, in Sigmaringen, a town in modern-day Germany, then under the Principality of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen. His father's name was John Rey. He studied law and philosophy at the University of Freiburg. Roy subsequently taught philosophy at this university, ultimately earning the degree of Doctor of Law. During his time as a student he did not drink wine, and wore a hair-shirt. He was known for his modesty, meekness and chastity. In 1604, Roy accompanied, as preceptor (teacher-mentor), three young Swabian gentlemen on their travels through the principal parts of Europe. During six years of travel, he attended Mass very frequently. In every town they came to, he visited the hospitals and churches, passed several hours on his knees in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, and was generous to the poor, sometimes giving them the very clothes off his back. Upon his return, he practiced law as a counselor or advocate, at Colmar in Alsace, France, where he came to be known as the 'poor man's lawyer'. He scrupulously forbore all invectives, detractions, and whatever might affect the reputation of any adversary. Disenchanted with the evils associated with his profession, he determined to join his brother George as a member of the Capuchin friars. Life as a friar Upon entering the Capuchin order, the guardian gave him the religious name of Fidelis, the Latin word for \\"faithful,\\" alluding to that text from the Book of Revelation which promises a crown of life to him who shall continue faithful to the end. He finished his novitiate and studies for the priesthood, presiding over his first Mass at the Capuchin friary in Fribourg (in present-day Switzerland) on October 4, 1612 (the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the order). As soon as Fidelis finished his course of theology, he was immediately employed in preaching and in hearing confessions. He became guardian of the Capuchin friary in Weltkirchen, Feldkirch, (in present-day Austria). During a severe epidemic in a city, Fidelis cared for and cured many sick soldiers. Many residents of the town and neighboring places were reformed by his zealous labors, and several Calvinists were converted. The Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith commissioned Fidelis to preach in the Graub√ºnden region of eastern Switzerland. Eight other Capuchin friars were to be his assistants, and they labored in this mission under his direction. The Calvinists of that territory, being incensed at his success in converting their brethren, loudly threatened Fidelis' life, and he prepared himself for martyrdom. Ralph de Salis and another Calvinist gentleman were both converted by his missionary efforts. Fidelis and his companions entered into Pr√§ttigau, a small district of Graub√ºnden, in 1622, on the Feast of the Epiphany, January 6. The effects of his ardent zeal, about which the Bishop of Coire sent a lengthy and full account to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, enraged the Calvinists in that province. On April 24, 1622, Fidelis made his confession, celebrated Mass and then preached at Gr√ºsch. At the end of his sermon, which he had delivered with more than ordinary zeal, he stood silent all of a sudden, with his eyes fixed upon Heaven, in ecstasy. He foretold his death to several persons in the clearest terms, and began signing his letters, \\"P. Fidelis, prope diem esca vermium\\" (\\"Father Fidelis, in days ahead to become food for worms\\"). After the service at Gr√ºsch he and several companions traveled to Seewis. His companions noted that he was particularly cheerful. Death St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen with St. Joseph of Leonessa (Tiepolo, 1752-1758). On April 24, in a campaign organized by the Habsburgs, Fidelis was preaching under protection of some Austrian imperial soldiers in the Church at Seewis with the aim of reconverting the people of Seewis to Catholicism. During the sermon, his listeners were called \\"to arms\\" by the Calvinist agitators outside. Some of the people went to face the Austrian troops outside the church. Fidelis had been persuaded by the remaining Catholics to immediately flee with the Austrian troops out of Seewis, which he did, but then returned alone to Gr√ºsch. On his way back he was confronted by 20 Calvinist soldiers who demanded unsuccessfully that he renounce the Catholic faith, and when he refused, they subsequently murdered him.

Sadlier, & Company Veneration It is said that a Catholic woman lay concealed near the place of Fidelis' martyrdom as the saint was slain. After the soldiers had left, she came out to assess the incident and found the martyr's eyes open, fixed on the heavens. He was buried by Catholics the next day. The rebels were soon after defeated by the imperial troops, an event which the martyr had foretold. The Protestant minister who had participated in Fidelis' martyrdom was converted by this circumstance, made a public abjuration of Calvinism and was received into the Catholic Church. After six months, the martyr's body was found to be incorrupt, but his head and left arm were separated from his body. The body parts were then placed into two reliquaries, one sent to the Cathedral of Coire, at the behest of the bishop, and laid under the High Altar; the other was placed in the Capuchin church at Weltkirchen, Feldkirch, Austria. Saint Fidelis' feast day in the Catholic Church is celebrated on April 24. See also * Saint Fidelis of Sigmaringen, patron saint archive References Sources *Acts of the canonization of SS.

As of March 2016, the band consists of front-man and co-founder Chris \\"OJ\\" Ojeda (rhythm guitar and vocals), Brian Henderson (guitar), Matt Bowles (drums) and Ryan Postlethwait (bass guitar). The band has released three studio albums on Prosthetic Records along with two independent albums. Byzantine is known for its unique sound and modern, \\"forward thinking\\" musical style which explores different musical territories and song structures. The band split on January 26, 2008, one day after the release of their third album, due to various circumstances, but reunited in 2010. On March 31, 2016, Metal Blade Records announced that they had signed the band to a worldwide deal and that they would be releasing a new album on July 28, 2017.  History  Byzantine was formed in the spring of 2000 by bassist Chris \\"Cid\\" Adams, lead guitarist Tony Rohrbough, drummer Jeremy Freeman, and vocalist/rhythm guitarist Chris \\"OJ\\" Ojeda after their former bands, New Family and Temper, disbanded. Byzantine wrote four songs, then seven more songs were written, and 2000-2001 Demos was recorded and self- released in 2001. Soon after, Byzantine became a part of the local West Virginian heavy metal scene. Subsequently, the band recruited local musician Matt Wolfe as a drummer. Ten songs featuring Wolfe were recorded in 2003 at Broadmoor Studios in Huntington, West Virginia and were released as The Broadmoor Demo, arousing the interest of Lamb of God's drummer Chris Adler. Byzantine then had a short East Coast tour with Lamb of God. This tour helped them obtain new fans and a deal with Prosthetic Records. Soon after Byzantine released their debut album The Fundamental Component in February 2004, which introduced the band's trademark sound. Subsequently, Byzantine toured with Lamb of God and Shadows Fall as well as playing the main stage of New England Metal and Hardcore Festival in 2004 (and later in 2006). Chris \\"Cid\\" Adams was soon fired, and Byzantine returned to the studio to record their second album in 2005: ...And They Shall Take Up Serpents, with Tony Rohrbough taking over bass duties in the studio. The album received high praise both abroad and domestically. A 2007 fan-oriented DVD titled Salvation, featuring exclusive material, scenes, in-studio clips, interviews, the uncut version of the \\"Jeremiad\\" music video and the performance of the never-before released \\"Cradle Song\\", increased the band's popularity. On January 22, 2008, the band's third studio album Oblivion Beckons was released. The band announced its break up one day after the release. In March 2010, the band reunited and played local shows around West Virginia. The band members insisted that they had returned with the intention of carrying on Byzantine. However, it was announced on August 17, 2010, that original guitarist and founding member Tony Rohrbough would leave with the group. Brian Henderson then filled his role. On January 26, 2012, it was announced the band was reunited with original lead guitarist Tony Rohrbough and had plans to record another album, which was to be self-funded. On February 26, 2013, their self-titled album was released. Bassist Michael \\"Skip\\" Cromer left the band due to finding religion. On May 29, 2014, it was publicized that Byzantine would be recording their fifth album that September when producer Jay Hannon returned to West Virginia with new guitarist Brian Henderson and new bassist Sean Sydnor. On April 7, 2015, the studio album To Release Is to Resolve was released independently by Byzantine for the second time. In March 2016, the band announced on media that they had signed a 4 record contract with metal powerhouse label Metal Blade Records. It was announced that the band would begin recording in late summer 2016 for a spring 2017 release. The band finally entered the studio, once again working with Producer Jay Hannon. Byzantine recorded at Byzantine Studios and 7 over 8 Studios. The release date of The Cicada Tree was pushed from spring to June 2 and ultimately was released on 28 July 2017. Byzantine then set out on their 1st true North American tour from mid September to October 2017, in support of thrash metal legends Sacred Reich. Byzantine also introduced a new level of crowd interaction as a Tier on their Pledge Music drive. They gave 1 fan the option to buy a tier that allowed them to pick 75% of that nights set list. The Byz Boss was well received by concert goers.  Musical style, influences and lyrical themes  Byzantine plays progressive thrash, which was compared by Decibel Magazine to Testament and Megadeth, with power groove moves comparable to Meshuggah or Lamb of God, and occasional clean vocals. The band's former record label, Prosthetic Records, has also compared them to Pantera. Byzantine plays technical metal and retro-minded Bay Area thrash. Their music has been described as simultaneously melodic and aggressive. Byzantine also occasionally incorporates instrumental parts in their songs and spoken word vocals. The guitar solos alone move from fast parts to progressive to jazz. The band also uses acoustic guitar and tribal- esque drum beats. Byzantine plays very modern metal, exploring different musical territories or song structures, and has been labeled as a \\"forward- thinking\\" band. Growing up in West Virginia has helped Byzantine develop a unique sound. \\"We are quite alienated from any big scene\\", explains Ojeda. \\"Therefore, we tend to think for ourselves a lot more when writing material.\\" The Gauntlet states \\"The Fundamental Component is characterized by long songs, melodic thrash and Tony Rohrbough's scathing guitar solos while still embracing technical chaos and the violent groove of bassist Chris Adams and drummer Matt Wolfe.\\" Byzantine singer/guitarist Chris Ojeda says \\"I think we have a knack for achieving a good balance of chaos and melody\\". Liz Ciavarella from Metal Maniacs magazine uses formulations such as \\"Scrupulous time-shifts and placed off-beats; forever infectious grooves, breakdowns (Thrashdowns?) and ceaseless experimentation that end in intricate catchy Metal mantras\\" to describe Byzantine's style. Byzantine frontman Chris Ojeda, who plays guitar while singing, is considered to be in the tradition of James Hetfield, Dave Mustaine, Max Cavalera, Mikael Akerfeldt, and Chuck Schuldiner. Lyrically the band is influenced by such bands as Meshuggah, Carcass and Opeth and focuses on problems indigenous to their home, such as religion in American society.

Gabriel Bonnot de Mably (Grenoble, 14 March 1709 ‚Äì 2 April 1785 in Paris), sometimes known as Abb√© de Mably, was a French philosopher, historian, and writer, who for a short time served in the diplomatic corps. He was a popular 18th-century writer. Biography thumbleft150px alt=An official dressed as a 'noble of the robe'An official dressed as a Noblesse de robe; Gabriel Bonnet came from this class Gabriel Bonnot was born at Mably, Loire into a family that belonged to the Noblesse de robe or Nobles of the robe. This class formed the Second Estate whose rank derived from holding judicial or administrative posts and were often hard- working professionals, unlike the aristocratic Noblesse d'√©p√©e or Nobles of the Sword. He and his older brother Jean added \\"de Mably\\" to their names; his younger brother √âtienne used another family property, at Condillac, Dr√¥me. As 'Condillac', he also became a noted writer and philosopher. Gabriel and his brothers were educated in an institution run by the Society of Jesus or Jesuits; he enrolled in a seminary at Saint-Sulpice. In 1742, he became a confidant of Cardinal Tencin, then Minister of State without Portfolio, for whom he carried out various diplomatic roles during the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession. They included negotiating an alliance with Prussia in 1743 and preparing terms for the 1746 Congress of Breda, which sought to agree a separate peace with Britain. However, he fell out with Cardinal Tencin and thereafter focused on scholarly pursuits. Based on the recommendation of Fran√ßoise-Louise de Warens, in April 1740, Mably's older brother Jean employed the 28 year old Jean-Jacques Rousseau as tutor for his two oldest sons. Rousseau produced two short works addressed to Jean de Mably: ‚ÄúMemorandum Presented to Monsieur de Mably on the Education of Monsieur His Son‚Äù and the shorter ‚ÄúPlan for the Education of Monsieur de Sainte-Marie.‚Äù These outline a proposed system of education for Jean de Mably's sons and also present one of his earliest public self-reflections and self-justifications. By summer 1741, Rousseau realized he was ill-suited to the position and the two agreed to end his employment, parting on friendly terms. The historian Leo Damrosch explains that at this time, Abb√© de Mably > \\"had just published a treatise comparing Roman institutions of government > with French ones and celebrating the progress of civilization...Conversing > with Mably, Condillac, [and friends he had met at Lyon's reading club] > Parisot, Bordes, and their friends, Rousseau found himself in a stimulating > intellectual milieu, and the studies he had put himself through in Chamb√©ry > suddenly came to life.\\" Rousseau would remain lifelong friends with Mably and his family. Both Mably and his brother Condillac visited Rousseau when he moved to Montmorency, Val-d'Oise. Rousseau later reflected upon his experience tutoring Jean de Mably's sons in The Confessions. Writings Engraving of Gabriel Bonnot de MablyMably's most well-known work is Entretiens de Phocion, a dialogue first published in 1763, which introduced themes of his mature thought. Two of his works were published posthumously and they had a profound effect on the early deliberations on the assembly of the Estates-General of 1789: an enlarged version of his Histoire de France (first published in 1765), which was published in May 1789 to great acclaim. Authorities tried unsuccessfully to suppress it by confiscating many copies. Secondly, Des droits et des devoirs du citoyen, written in 1758, was also published after his death. He warned against events that later developed during the French Revolution. These two works were seen to contribute to the later concepts of both communism and republicanism. He advocated the abolition of private property, which he saw as incompatible with sympathy and altruism, and conductive only to one's antisocial or egotistical instincts. Mably's writings contain a paradox: he praises elitist Plato, but also the enlightened Stoic views on natural human equality. Mably went further than the traditional Stoic argument that all men possessed a divine spark. He also went beyond the liberal concept of equality before the law, and argued for the equality of needs. He argued that virtue was more valued than the acquisition or possession of material wealth, and criticized idleness. He found an audience among those who were critical of the inherited wealth and privilege of the nobility, who did no work. Mably's complete works were published in 15 volumes in 1794‚Äì1795, with an obituary/biography by Gabriel Brizard.

The village is within the civil parish of Seneley Green. The parish was historically part of Ashton-in-Makerfield township. History Historically within Lancashire, Garswood is from Old English wudu \\"wood\\" with an uncertain first element. The name was recorded as Gratiswode (undated). Garswood has seen, along with extensive farming, much coal mining activity in its past, due to strata running up to an adjacent fault causing much outcropping of coal seams. Mining has taken place using (comparatively) shallow shafts and many drifts. The last drift mine in the Garswood area, Quaker House Colliery, closed in 1992. Extensive opencast mining has taken place in more recent times and still continues in the area. The village contains the Railway Hotel, the Stag Hotel and the Simms Road Inn public houses. It also has a Labour Club,a Conservative Club, and Garswood United Football Club. Education In 1588 Seneley Green (as it was then known) became the site of Ashton-in-Makerfield Free Grammar School, the area's first free grammar school, founded by Robert Byrchall on land granted for the purpose by Sir Thomas Gerard. Whilst the original building has long since demolished, today the site is used as Garswood Public Library. Ashton-in- Makerfield Free Grammar School was attended by Saint Edmund Arrowsmith,http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OJJB0hbD4tgJ:www.archive.org/stream/MN41798ucmf_2/MN41798ucmf_2_djvu.txt+life+of+blessed+john+southworth&cd;=2&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=uk one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.

It was home of the Birmingham Barons of the Southern League from 1988 to 2012, replacing historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham. The stadium also serves as the home for the SEC Baseball Tournament, as well as the primary home for Hoover High School football. It is located in the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area near Interstate 459 at Exit 10 just off Alabama State Route 150. The stadium is located three miles from the Riverchase Galleria, one of the south's largest shopping centers. The seating capacity is 10,800 for baseball and can accommodate up to 16,000 when the patio, banquet, and grassy side areas are used. The stadium also houses 12 suites and state-of-the-art dressing and training rooms. The stadium also features a meeting/banquet room named for Michael Jordan, who played for the Barons during his brief foray into professional baseball, during which time the stadium experienced its largest crowds for professional baseball. (The Barons were at the time an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, which Jordan's business interests with owner Jerry Reinsdorf were related. Also, the Southeastern Conference games are very widely attended) The City of Hoover operates the stadium and an adjacent recreational vehicle (RV) park. The Hoover Met hosted the AVP Birmingham Open on July 13‚Äì16, 2006, the first beach volleyball tournament to ever be played in Alabama. The feature court was above the baseball diamond as well as eight other courts on the field, made of 222 tons of sand per court. The stadium also played host to the 2011 and 2012 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship. Along with Birmingham city officials, the Barons announced plans in November 2010 to return to Birmingham with a new field to be constructed downtown, near the University of Alabama at Birmingham campus. Pending contract negotiations and construction, play at the new field was originally expected to begin with the 2012 season. Due to site selection, financing issues, and problems obtaining all of the land sought by the developers the move was delayed until the 2013 season. On December 20, 2012, the City of Hoover announced a change in name changing the name of the ballpark back to its original name, \\"The Hoover Metropolitan Stadium\\". The name change took effect on January 1, 2013. The Hoover Met hosted the Alabama Crimson Tide during the 2015 season while its on-campus stadium in Tuscaloosa, Sewell‚ÄìThomas Stadium, underwent major renovations. As part of the agreement, outfield fences were moved in to more closely match the dimensions of TD Ameritrade Park Omaha, home of the College World Series. The new configuration remained in place for the 2015 Southeastern Conference Baseball Tournament.

The specials are often taped in places such as cheese factories and restaurants to play on the name \\"Fromage\\". \\"Fromage\\" is French for \\"cheese\\". The format has changed from year to year; in 1999, rather than looking back at the previous year's videos, the special focused on the worst videos of the 20th century. From then to 2003, the awards were given according to categories nominated in, then counted down from least to most votes. 2001 was the last year the show was seen on MuchMusic USA, after that network decided to end simulcasting MuchMusic and eventually become fuse. In 2004, the format was changed to a top 40 cheesiest video countdown, where any video can be nominated. This has caused videos to be voted that Ed has not agreed with. These are usually due to the videos being intentionally cheesy, whereas Fromage is supposed to deal with videos that are not aware of their own cheesiness. Such videos included: * The Darkness‚Äî\\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\" (2004) * Franz Ferdinand‚Äî\\"Do You Want To\\" (2005) * Crazy Frog‚Äî\\"Axel F\\" (2005) In December 2006, it was announced that no Fromage special would air on MuchMusic, but a 30-minute special entitled \\"Ultra Fromage 2006\\" would air exclusively on Citytv. In order to differentiate itself from the previous Fromage specials, it covered aspects of show business and pop culture, with a short segment on the cheesiest music videos at the end of the program. Ed the Sock maintained hosting duties and was joined by Liana K, his co-host on the Citytv show, Ed & Red's Night Party. This was the last Fromage as Ed's relationship with Citytv ended when new owners re-branded the channel, but the Ultra-Fromage style was a template for what would become I Hate Hollywood on CHCH TV.Much Ado About Ed by Sam Tweedle In 2008, the MuchMusic program Video on Trial, itself a show that critiques music videos with a rotating panel of comedians, presented the \\"Best of the Worst 2008\\" special in December 2008, counting down the worst 20 music videos of the year in a format similar to that of Fromage 2004 and 2005. It was followed up with editions in each subsequent year. The show was revived after an eight-year hiatus with \\"Fromage 2013\\", albeit with a shorter run-time similar to \\"Ultra Fromage\\", which is featured on the XSNetwork's channel on YouTube. It is once again hosted by Ed the Sock and counts down the nine cheesiest videos of the year, as chosen by Ed personally (as opposed to being chosen by viewers in previous years). It was originally intended to be a one- hour special, like previous Fromage specials, but production was cut due to a power outage caused by the Toronto Ice Storm in late December 2013. = Fromage number ones = *1993: \\"Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Techno\\" by BKS featuring Don Cherry *1994: \\"Cotton Eye Joe\\" by Rednex *1997: \\"Electric Barbarella\\" by Duran Duran *1998: \\"Do for Love\\" by Tupac Shakur *1999: \\"Just the Way I Planned It\\" by Philip Michael Thomas (voted cheesiest video of 20th century) *2000: \\"The Hampsterdance Song\\" credited to \\"Hampton the Hampster\\" *2001: \\"Not Too Young, Not Too Old\\" by Aaron Carter *2002: \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" by Kelly Osbourne *2003: \\"Me Against the Music\\" by Britney Spears featuring Madonna *2004: \\"My Prerogative\\" by Britney Spears *2005: \\"Do Somethin'\\" by Britney Spears *2006: \\"Lose Control\\" by Kevin Federline *2013: \\"Bound 2\\" by Kanye West See also *Video on Trial, a currently-running MuchMusic series featuring comedic reviews of music videos References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20051125034504/http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/specials/fromage2005/ (Internet Archive) *https://web.archive.org/web/20041117021453/http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/specials/fromage2004/ (Internet Archive) *https://web.archive.org/web/20031203050640/http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/specials/fromage2003/ (Internet Archive) Much (TV channel) original programming 2005 Canadian television series endings Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Ed the Sock 2000s Canadian music television series ","title":"Fromage"},{"id":"1790119","text":"North Elmham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

The village is about north of East Dereham on the west bank of the River Wensum. North Elmham was the site of a pre-Norman cathedral, seat of the Bishop of Elmham until 1075.  History  St Mary's church, North Elmham The name North Elmham comes from the Old English, meaning \\"village where elms grow\\" and is first mentioned in 1035.Ekwall, E. Concise Dictionary of English Place-names Only ruins now survive of a Norman Chapel which is now looked after by English Heritage.http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/north-elmham- chapel/ The chapel is on the site of an earlier Anglo Saxon timber cathedral which housed the episcopal throne of the bishops of Elmham from around 672 until the episcopal see was moved to Thetford in 1071. A mid 9th-century copper-alloy hanging censer was discovered at North Elmham in 1786. The earthworks and ruins at North Elmham stewarded by English Heritage are thought to be the remains of Bishop Herbert de Losinga's late 11th-century episcopal church and the late 14th-century double-moated castle built on this by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich. Henry came from a powerful family who had strong links with the House of Plantagenet and the notorious 'favourites' of King Edward II. To the north of the village was the Norfolk County School which on closing in the 1890s was taken over for the Watts Naval School. The fine buildings have now been demolished. The village is also the birthplace of the actor John Mills. The County School railway station served the school, and today is preserved by the Mid-Norfolk Railway as a small visitor centre. The village once had its own railway station, North Elmham railway station, on the line from Wymondham to Fakenham. The building still exists but is now a residential home, although the railway line remains and is under restoration to use. A section of the line, between North Elmham and County School station, includes a permissive footpath. North Elmham Mill, known locally as Grint Mill, had two breastshot waterwheels until the early 20th century when they were replaced by two turbines. By the 1970s the milling machinery was driven by mains electricity while the turbines were used to drive a sack hoist and two mixing machines. The mill continued to produce animal feed into the late 20th century.  Notable residents  * John Mills, actor, was born in the village.

In 2010, he became host of BBC Television's Match of the Day 2 on BBC Two, while still anchoring shows on BBC Radio 5 Live, including 5 Live Sport and Fighting Talk and was still presenting on BBC Radio Ulster. He has previously hosted regular Channel 5 television and BBC Radio 1 shows. In 2007, he was named 'Music Broadcaster of the Year' at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. Born and raised in Dundonald, east of Belfast, Murray first trained and worked as a news journalist. With a passion for both music and sport, he later moved into music journalism and publishing, before making his national radio debut in 1999 on Radio 1 in a short spell co-hosting The Session music show. This was followed by a television debut in 2002 as one of six co-presenters on Channel 4's short- lived morning show RI:SE. From 2003 onwards Murray established himself as a music radio presenter on the weekday daytime Colin and Edith show, alongside Edith Bowman. In 2006 Murray began his first role on BBC Radio 5 Live, hosting the sports-themed Saturday morning comedy panel game Fighting Talk, and also began presenting Channel 5's live UEFA Cup football coverage on midweek evenings. In 2006, he moved shows on Radio 1, departing Colin and Edith to front the late-night weekday evening music vehicle, The Colin Murray Show. In 2008, he also began presenting The Late Show with Colin Murray, a once-a-week late-night music show for Radio Ulster. The next year, he left Radio 1 to take on additional roles at 5 Live, hosting Kicking off with Colin Murray on Friday nights, and 5 Live Sport on Sunday afternoons. In 2010, he moved from presenting live football on Channel 5 to fronting the BBC's Match of the Day 2 Sunday night highlights show. In 2013, he announced he was leaving BBC Radio 5 Live to move to commercial rival Talksport, taking up the 10am1pm slot vacated by Richard Keys and Andy Gray. Murray announced via Twitter in July 2016 that he was to leave Talksport in September 2016, following the takeover of the station by News Corp. He stated that the concomitant business links between Talksport and The Sun meant that, after the scandal of the Hillsborough disaster and of its coverage by The Sun, his position would be untenable owing to the feelings of Liverpool fans (including himself) towards that newspaper. Since August 2017, Murray has hosted the Saturday night EFL television highlights show, first for Channel 5 in the 2017/18 season and since August 2018 for Quest on EFL on Quest. Life and career =1977‚Äì1993: Early life= Murray was born in 1977 in the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, a suburb of East Belfast, Northern Ireland, and grew up in Dundonald's Ballybeen estate.TV Interview: Early riser Belfast Telegraph, 8 June 2002 He was educated at the Regent House Grammar School in Newtownards, and later at Dundonald High School, leaving after GCSEs. Hyperactive since childhood, Murray was asked to leave the grammar school due to what was perceived by teachers as a tendency to disruption ‚Äì always asking awkward questions or telling jokes ‚Äì traits he later identified as ideal for his future career in presenting, and which he felt should really have been nurtured by teachers. =1994‚Äì2002: Early career and radio debut= After leaving school, Murray went on to study journalism full-time. He started work as a news journalist, working both in Northern Ireland as a trainee for The News Letter, before in 1994 moving to Toronto, Canada, for a year, working on a fellowship for the Toronto Sun.Our Colin is going back to his roots Belfast Telegraph, 26 January 2008 After returning from Toronto he moved into music journalism, writing for newspapers about rock and pop bands, including establishing a long-standing column in the Irish Sunday People, before moving into the music magazine business with a new title called BLANK. After Murray set it up and acted as co-publisher, Blank became the highest circulating music magazine in Ulster. After Blank was merged with another title, Murray left the magazine. Next, Murray joined BBC Radio 1 on 2 September 1999 to co-presented the weekly live music programme Session in Northern Ireland on BBC Radio 1, alongside BBC Radio Ulster presenter Donna Legge, broadcast only in Northern Ireland. He had initially thought the audition was for a show on BBC Radio Ulster. That was followed by six months in 1999 presenting the main national The Session programme from Tuesdays to Thursdays. Spells deputising for hosts of other major Radio 1 shows also followed. By 2002, Murray's work in radio and television earned him an audition as one of six co-presenters of Channel 4's new national breakfast television show, RI:SE. Having initially auditioned as the entertainment presenter, Murray was instead chosen as a news presenter. While at RI:SE he continued to co-host the evening session in Northern Ireland with Donna Legge one day a week, commuting between the province and the Channel 4 studios near Heathrow. His time with RI:SE was brief and unhappy, with Murray later stating it \\"scared me off TV for a long time\\". =2003‚Äì2008: Radio career= By 2003 Murray had teamed up with Edith Bowman (his former co- host from RI:SE) to work together on Radio 1, presenting their own Colin and Edith show. It began in September 2003 in the weekend late-morning slot, but from March 2004 it was moved to the weekday afternoon slot. The partnership increased the listener figures to a decade high of 5.5 million. In 2006 Murray became the new presenter of BBC Radio 5 Live's Saturday morning comedy sports panel quiz show, Fighting Talk, his first regular show on 5 Live. His first show was on 4 February. Also in February 2006, Murray became the anchor for Channel 5's midweek evening live European UEFA Cup football television coverage, with former anchor John Barnes acting as a roving reporter. That year Murray left the Radio 1 Colin and Edith show to start The Colin Murray Show, a new music show on the same station beginning in September, showcasing new and alternative music in the Mondays-to-Thursdays 10pmmidnight slot, with Bowman remaining in the lunchtime slot. He was inevitably compared with the late holder of the slot, John Peel; Murray stated \\"What I like is that it's always represented honesty, and never been influenced by what's supposed to be cool at the time. Peel played music he liked; I just play music I like\\". In 2007, there was a year-on-year increase in listeners to the slot of 160,000. From February 2008 Murray also began presenting a weekly late-night music show on BBC Radio Ulster in Northern Ireland. After failing to find a suitable sound location, he actually presents the show from his own house, in his bedroom, drawing on his extensive music collection as well as new music downloaded onto iTunes. It began as a Saturday night show, but later moved to Fridays. =2009‚Äì2013: Departure from Radio 1, move to 5 Live and television career= In 2009 Murray resigned from his Radio 1 late night show to expand his work at BBC Radio 5 Live, becoming the new presenter of 5 Live Sport on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons, in time for the start of the 2009/10 football season. The Friday slot was a weekend preview show, Kicking Off with Colin Murray, while the Sunday show comprises six hours of live sports coverage. Kicking Off saw an increase in listeners after its first year of almost 20 per cent, according to 5 September 2011 figures.Match of the Day 2 Scores Highest Ever Rating, Murray's personal website, 30 August, 2011 .

At the end of the 2013 season, Colin Murray announced he was leaving BBC Radio 5 Live to host a new mid-morning show from 10am to 1pm on its commercial rival Talksport, replacing Richard Keys and Andy Gray, and therefore he would be leaving his Kicking Off show and Fighting Talk. His departure from Fighting Talk was the result of a controversy after he joked on the programme about being able to \\"turn\\" Claire Balding. Murray expressed deep regret for the line and stated that he did not come up with it, but that it had been written on his autocue. In an interview with the Guardian, he said, \\"The second I said it, I knew it was too much.\\" The episode concerned was a special live outside broadcast, as opposed to the usual recorded studio format; consequently, the habitual advance checks on content had not been performed. Had it been an ordinary studio broadcast, Murray would have not have approved the joke and would have removed it from the script. The episode has been removed from all online playback sources. Murray made his Talksport debut on 12 August 2013 on a new show entitled Colin Murray and Friends. Murray hosted alongside Stuart Pearce and Perry Groves on Monday (previously Mike Tindall), Des Kelly and Michael Gray on Tuesday, Steve Bunce and Didi Hamann on Wednesday, Daley Thompson and Danny Murphy on Thursday (previously Kelly Sotherton), and Bob Mills and Perry Groves on Friday.

Murray's decision to leave was triggered by the purchase of Talksport by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, who in turn owns The Sun. Murray, a Liverpool fan, stated that he was concerned by the \\"inevitable closer association of the Station with the Sun newspaper\\". On September 12, Murray announced via his Twitter feed that he would be returning to BBC Radio 5 Live to host Fighting Talk.

Today the state has broad gauge suburban railways in Adelaide, a number of country freight lines, as well as key standard gauge links to other states. Gauge In 1847, the South Australian Parliament passed an act confirming the adoption of the standard gauge of for Australia. South Australia was the first state to do so. In 1848 the Colonial Secretary in London, Lord Grey, recommended the Australian colonies all adopt standard gauge. However, this advice got muddled up. The first of the main line railways in Adelaide was built in 1856 between the city and the port, in the broad gauge, to maintain compatibility with Victoria after a change from by New South Wales' which changed back before it built its railways. The main line to Melbourne was opened after a bridge was built at Murray Bridge in 1886. It was the first railway line between colony capitals to not have a break-of-gauge. It was also the last of these to be converted to standard gauge in 1995. =Narrow gauge= Influenced by Queensland Railway's successful adoption of the narrow gauge for cost reasons (opened 1865), and influenced by the advocacy of people such as Abraham Fitzgibbon South Australia changed the gauge of the Port Wakefield line in the middle of construction. The Port Wakefield line, opened 1870, was originally horse drawn. Because the narrow gauge lines of started out as isolated lines from independent ports at Port Wakefield, Port Pirie, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Broughton, Beachport, Kingston SE and Wallaroo, and a private tramway from Whyalla, the problems of the nascent break of gauge was not immediately apparent. When the broad and narrow systems finally met at Hamley Bridge, Terowie, Wolseley and Mount Gambier endless complaints started. There may have been even more breaks of gauge, as the original bridge at Murray Bridge was designed for narrow gauge. The horse-drawn narrow gauge line at Port Broughton on the Yorke Peninsula was never connected to the main system. The lines on the Eyre Peninsula Railway and throughout the mid-north were built to narrow gauge. Once the narrow gauge from Port Pirie to Broken Hill was converted to standard gauge, the narrow gauge from Terowie was converted to broad gauge to Peterborough. Peterborough became the change of gauge station for Broken Hill Adelaide express. The narrow gauge line was retained north from Peterborough to Quorn. The main interstate links from Adelaide to Perth, Darwin, Melbourne, and Sydney are all of standard gauge. Operators The country railways were initially owned by South Australian Railways. The narrow gauge lines north and west of Quorn were handed over to the Commonwealth Railways in 1926, though the Commonwealth had had financial responsibility for these lines since 1911. The Commonwealth Railways later merged with the SAR to become the Australian National Railways Commission (ANR) in 1978. The metropolitan railway lines are now owned and operated by Adelaide Metro, interstate passenger services operated by Journey Beyond, intrastate freight by One Rail Australia, and interstate freight by a number of companies including Bowmans Rail, One Rail Australia, Pacific National and SCT Logistics. Passenger services TransAdelaide 3000 class railcar as used on Adelaide suburban services The Indian Pacific from Adelaide to Sydney near Hawker Street, Bowden Passenger services in South Australia have declined since the days of the South Australian Railways, today the only services are the Adelaide Metro suburban services; and the Journey Beyond operated The Overland between Adelaide and Melbourne, the Indian Pacific between Perth and Sydney via Adelaide, and The Ghan from Adelaide to Darwin, via Alice Springs.

History The first railway in colonial South Australia was the horse-drawn tramway from Goolwa to Port Elliot opened in 1854, providing a rail link from the port of Goolwa on the Murray River to an ocean harbour at Port Elliot. It was later extended to a safer harbour at Victor Harbor. This line was used to move freight between the shallow-draft vessels navigating the Murray, and coastal and ocean-going vessels, without either having to traverse the narrow and shallow mouth of the river with unpredictable currents. The first of the Railways in Adelaide was built in 1856 between the city and the port. The Adelaide railways were all built as broad gauge of . Gradually, a network of lines spread out from Adelaide. These were initially built to carry ore, particularly copper, then later freight from the Murray River, and grain from the broadacre lands. In the first half of the 20th century, most of these lines carried passengers as well as freight. The main line to Melbourne was opened after a bridge was built at Murray Bridge in 1886. It was the first railway line between colony capitals to not have a break-of-gauge. It was also the last of these to be converted to standard gauge in 1995.

This line is now part of the Adelaide suburban network and has been proposed for standardisation and conversion to light rail. It was extended as the Outer Harbor line to Outer Harbor in 1908. A branch was built to Grange in 1882. It was extended as the Henley Beach line to Henley Beach in 1894 and closed in 1957. Development of the lines Map of railways extant and proposed in 1910 in South Australia =Southern Lines= The South Line, through the Adelaide Hills, was opened to Aldgate, Nairne in 1883, Murray Bridge in 1884 and Bordertown and Serviceton, Victoria, connecting with Victorian Railways in 1887. This line was standardised in 1995. A branch line was built to Marino in 1913, and extended to Willunga in 1915. The section from Hallett Cove to Willunga was closed in 1969. In the 1970s the line was extended south from Hallett Cove, becoming what is now the Adelaide Metro Seaford railway line. It reached Christie Downs in 1976, Noarlunga Centre in 1978, with a further extension to Seaford in 2014. The beginnings of the Victor Harbor line was a horse-drawn broad () gauge tramway built from the port of Goolwa on the Murray River to an ocean harbour at Port Elliot in 1854. This line was used to move freight between the shallow-draft vessels navigating the Murray, and coastal and ocean-going vessels, without either having to traverse the narrow and shallow mouth of the river with unpredictable currents. It was later extended from Port Elliot to Victor Harbor in 1864 and from Goolwa to Strathalbyn in 1869. It was extended to Mount Barker Junction on the South Line in 1884 and strengthened to carry steam trains. A branch from the South Line between the Mount Lofty Ranges and Murray River was built to Monarto and Cambrai in 1886. It was shortened to Apamurra near Palmer before being closed due to the standardisation of the Adelaide ‚Äì Melbourne line in 1995. In the Murray Mallee, the Pinnaroo line was built from Tailem Bend to Pinnaroo in 1906. This was connected with the Victorian Railways at the Victorian border and Ouyen by 1915. The South Australian part of this line was converted to standard gauge in 1998 to reconnect it with the Adelaide ‚Äì Melbourne line. This created a break-of-gauge at Pinnaroo. The last traffic on the line was transporting grain from silos to Port Adelaide. Viterra announced that no more grain would be carried by rail on this line after 31 July 2015, with the 2015 harvest to be entirely transported by road. The Barmera railway line opened from Tailem Bend through Karoonda to Wanbi on 6 January 1913, extended to Paruna on 1 May and Meribah on 7 May 1913 (both in the Brown's Well district). Even while this line was still being built, the Government of South Australia approved several spur lines from it to open up over a million acres of farmland. These were:pp74-75 * Waikerie railway line Karoonda north to Waikerie (opened December 1914)closed 14 March 1990 to Galga, 4 March 1994 to Karoonda *Alawoona north to Loxton (opened February 1914) closed 2015 * Brown's Well north to Paringa (opened October 1913), closed to Alawoona December 1990 then Tailem Bend August 2015 * The Peebinga railway line east from Karoonda covering the gap between the Pinnaroo and Brown's Well lines, opened 18 December 1914, closed 7 December 1990. The government expected these lines to not recover the cost in the short term, but to open up land for farming wheat to \\"strengthen the backbone of South Australia\\". They were built using second-hand rails, and were the first in the state to use steel sleepers. Later, the Moorook railway line was opened from Wanbi to Yinkanie (near Moorook) in September 1925, but closed in 1971.The Yinkanie Line Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December 2002 pp443-448 In 1928 the line was opened from Paringa to Renmark and Barmera; it closed in 1990. The last of these lines was the Loxton railway line which was converted to standard gauge in 1998. It closed with the transfer of the grain traffic to road after July 2015. Viterra announced that no more grain would be carried by rail in the region after 31 July 2015, with the 2015 harvest to be entirely transported by road. Southern narrow gauge lines South Australian Railways V class No. 9 commenced service on the Kingston-Naracoorte railway (3‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥) in early 1877. Transferred to northern division of S.A.R. in 1888, retired in 1953 (on display in Naracoorte). In 1876 a narrow gauge line known as the Kingston- Naracoorte railway line was built from Kingston SE to Naracoorte. In 1879, a railway was built between Beachport, Millicent and Mount Gambier. In 1887 they were linked by a line from Mount Gambier to Naracoorte and Wolseley on the broad gauge Melbourne‚ÄìAdelaide railway, creating a break-of-gauge junction at Wolseley. It later had a branch line added from Wandilo to Glencoe.A Pastoral Railway ‚Äì Narrow Gauge Railways in the South-East of South Australia Callaghan, W.H. Australian Railway History, August to December 2004 pp302-315;331-339;376-387;424-432;463-466 January to March 2005 pp15-26;68-77;83-103. The Mount Gambier-Heywood railway line, a broad gauge line, was opened between Mount Gambier and Heywood near Portland in 1917. From 1953 to 1956, the southeastern lines were converted to broad gauge, with the exception of the Beachport ‚Äì Millicent and the Wandilo ‚Äì Glencoe line, which were closed down in 1957. The Kingston ‚Äì Naracoorte was closed on 28 November 1987. The other southeastern lines, including the line to Heywood, have been out of use since the standardisation of the Adelaide ‚Äì Melbourne and Maroona ‚Äì Portland lines on 12 April 1995. There are regular calls for their standardisation. =Northern lines= Broad gauge lines In 1857 the 42 km Gawler line was built to Gawler station, which was rural at the time, and extended to Roseworthy, Kapunda in 1860. The main line left the Kapunda branch at Roseworthy and proceeded to Hamley Bridge, Riverton, Burra in 1870. The Kapunda branch was extended to Morgan in 1878. The Burra line was extended to Terowie in 1880. The Barossa Valley railway line was built from Gawler Junction, north of Gawler station, through what is now Gawler Central station, to Nuriootpa and Angaston in the Barossa Valley in 1911. A further branch was constructed from Nuriootpa to Stockwell and Truro. The Penrice branch to the quarry from near Stockwell was the last destination to operate beyond Gawler Central. A branch line was built from Riverton to Clare in 1919 and Spalding in 1922. This line was lifted in the early 80s and parts of it have been restored as the Rattler Trail (Riverton to Auburn) and Riesling Trail (Auburn to Clare), a bicycle and walking trail through the Clare Valley. In 1925, a broad gauge line was built from Salisbury to Redhill and in 1937, it was extended to Port Pirie to meet the extension of the standard gauge from Port Augusta. This line was converted to standard gauge in 1982, including a deviation at the northern end to move the rail junction from Port Pirie to Crystal Brook. =Western Division narrow gauge lines= The lines in the Mid North (generally north of Goyder's Line, which is the limit of 10\\" annual rainfall) were built to narrow gauge . Upper Yorke Peninsula lines Broad-gauge tracks at the abandoned cargo rail station near the port in Wallaroo. The first narrow gauge line ran from Port Wakefield to Hoyleton, opened in 1870 and branched from Balaklava to Hamley Bridge in 1878, creating Australia's first break-of-gauge on the government railways. A horse-drawn tramway was built by the Kadina and Wallaroo Railway and Pier Company between Wallaroo and Kadina in 1862 and extended to Moonta in 1866. This was acquired by the South Australian Railways in 1877 and a new narrow gauge line was built along its route and connected to Port Wakefield in about 1878. A line was built from Brinkworth to Snowtown, Bute and Kadina in 1879. These lines were converted to broad gauge in 1927. All the lines west of the Adelaide-Crystal Brook standard gauge line and the line from Snowtown to Brinkworth were closed after the Adelaide ‚Äì Crystal Brook line was opened in 1982, despite proposals to convert some of them to standard gauge. There are calls to convert the Wolseley to Mount Gambier line to standard gauge. This partly reflects the lifting of restriction on the road transportation of grain Australia-wide that followed recommendations of the 1986-88 Royal Commission into grain storage, handling and transport. This particularly affected South Australian railways because of the short distances between the growing areas and its various wheat exporting ports. The Snowtown to Wallaroo Broad Gauge was converted to Dual Gauge (Standard/Broad) during the late 1980s. North Mount Lofty Ranges lines A line was built from Balaklava to Brinkworth and Gladstone by 1880 and later extended to Wilmington. The Hamley Bridge ‚Äì Balaklava ‚Äì Brinkworth ‚Äì Gladstone line was converted to broad gauge in 1927, making Gladstone a break- of-gauge junction. In 1969, when the line from Port Pirie to Broken Hill was converted to standard gauge, Gladstone became a three-gauge break-of-gauge junction (together with Peterborough and succeeding Port Pirie, which had been reduced to two gauges). In the 1980s, the broad gauge line north of Balaklava and the narrow gauge line were closed, leaving Gladstone as a purely standard gauge station. A narrow gauge line was built from Terowie to Peterborough in 1881, creating a break-of-gauge at Terowie, although the enforced train change created an opportunity for General Douglas MacArthur to deliver his famous line \\"I shall return\\" at Terowie station on 20 March 1942. The break-of-gauge was not overcome until the Terowie ‚Äì Peterborough line was converted to broad () gauge in 1970, to meet new the standard gauge from Port Pirie to Broken Hill, but it was abandoned by 1988. The narrow gauge line was extended to Orroroo also in 1881 and Quorn in 1882, connecting with the new line from Port Augusta. This line has now been abandoned. A narrow gauge railway was built from Port Pirie to Gladstone, Peterborough and Broken Hill, in 1888 to serve the Broken Hill silver and lead mine, which was becoming the largest and richest of its kind in the world. Since the New South Wales Government would not allow the South Australia railway to cross the border, the last 30 km was built by a private company as a tramway, the Silverton Tramway from Cockburn to Silverton and Broken Hill. In 1970 the line was converted to standard gauge, completing the standard transcontinental gauge line from Sydney to Perth. =The Great Northern Railway= The Great Northern Railway was completed from Port Augusta across the Pichi Richi Pass to Quorn in 1879, Hergott Springs (now known as Marree) in 1883 and Oodnadatta in 1891. It was extended to Alice Springs by the Commonwealth Railways in 1929, when it was renamed the Central Australia Railway. In 1957, the new standard gauge line was built from Stirling North (near Port Augusta) to Marree on a new alignment west of the Flinders Ranges and the narrow gauge line between Hawker and Marree was abandoned. The remainder of the narrow gauge line between Stirling North, Quorn and Hawker was abandoned in 1972, although the Stirling North ‚Äì Quorn section has been taken over by the Pichi Richi tourist railway (with a more recent extension into the town of Port Augusta completed in 2001). The narrow gauge line from Marree to Alice Springs was abandoned with the opening of the new standard gauge railway from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980, which forms part of the Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway. The standard gauge line from Stirling North has since been abandoned north of the Leigh Creek Coalfield. = Eyre Peninsula lines = The Eyre Peninsula Railway was built to narrow gauge as their primary purpose was to promote the development of the area. Construction started with a railway between Port Lincoln and Cummins, opened in 1907. Growth of the network continued through until the 1950s. The system covers some 800 route kilometres, of lightly built permanent way.The Railways of South Australia's West Coast Buckland, J.L. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May 1979 pp93-112 BHP developed two separate systems. The BHP Whyalla Tramway from the Whyalla Steelworks () for ore haulage, and the Coffin Bay Tramway, a standard gauge from Proper Bay to Coffin Bay on Southern Eyre Peninsula for mineral sand haulage. The tramway operated from 1966 and was closed in 1989, with the tracks being removed in 2000. =Northern Territory railway= NSU class diesel locomotive on display at Marree station The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911, when it was transferred to Commonwealth control. The Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway was a narrow gauge railway and ran from Darwin, once known as Palmerston, to Pine Creek. The John Cox Bray Government in South Australia introduced the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Bill in 1883. The ¬£959,300 contract went to C & E Millar of Melbourne on the proviso that they could use coolie labour. The line reached Pine Creek in 1888 and was officially opened on 30 September 1889. Singhalese and Indian gangs did the grubbing and earthwork and 3,000 Chinese labourers laid over 1 km of track per day. A total of 310 bridges and flood openings were built. The Commonwealth Government took over the line in 1911 and renamed it the Northern Territory Railway. The line was extended to Katherine in 1917. Further extensions in the 1920s saw it eventually reach Birdum, just south of Larrimah, in 1929, when it was further renamed the North Australia Railway, to distinguish it from the Central Australia Railway, which reached Alice Springs from the south in the same year. Although a railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin had been discussed for many years, the North Australia Railway was closed in 1976. However eventually the standard gauge Adelaide to Darwin Railway was finally completed on 17 September 2003 with the line between Alice Springs and Darwin. The first freight train reached Darwin on 17 January 2004. =Adelaide suburban network= Adelaide's metropolitan rail network was the last of Australia's five major cities to be electrified. Almost $500 million in funding has been provided in the 2008-09 State Budget for electrification and gauge conversion. However, not all lines have finished electrification, and at this stage, the Belair line will not be electrified. In Adelaide, concrete sleepers, installed since the 1990s are of a slightly more expensive gauge convertible type to facilitate the conversion.

The town lies on the stream Ruiten Aa, which has the valley that together with the Ter Apeler forest belongs to the national network of nature reserves, the Ecologische Hoofdstructuur. An accommodation centre for refugees is located at Ter Apel, functioning as a \\"departure centre\\" for rejected refugees and a registration point, operated by the Centraal Orgaan opvang Asielzoekers. Ter Apel lies on the roads N366, N976 and N391. It forms the southern point of the border between Groningen and Drenthe, the Semslinie.  History  The town was founded at a monastery, which from the thirteenth century was a chief work of the Premonstratensians and from 1465 an institution of the Order of the Holy Cross. It was closed in 1594 due to the Protestant Reformation. In 1619 ownership of Westerwolde passed to the city of Groningen, with the monastery and its grounds included. Over time the city planted forests on these grounds. In 1931-1933 the remaining parts of the monastery were restored. In 1976 ownership of the monastery and the forests passed to the state forest managers, Staatsbosbeheer. The agricultural land was also purchased after 1976. Since the 19th century, built-up strips have also formed due to Peat production from bogs along the Stads-Ter Apel canal in the direction of Stadskanaal, the Weerdingermond in the direction of Nieuw-Weerdinge, and in the direction of Emmer-Compascuum. In 1916 the Ruiten Aa canal was completed, which as of 2004 is again navigable for recreational boating. In the first half of the 20th century it was a hub for the rail and tram routes operated by the Eerste Drentsche Stoomtramweg Maatschappij (EDS), the Eerste Groninger Tramway-Maatschappij (EGTM), the Dedemsvaartsche Stoomtramweg-Maatschappij (DSM), the Stoomtramweg-Maatschappij Oostelijk Groningen (OG), and the Groningsch-Drentsche Spoorweg Maatschappij (Stadskanaal - Ter_Apel - national border) (STAR).

Most of the species are native to eastern Asia in China, Japan, Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, with two (S. malacodendron, S. ovata) in southeast North America, from Virginia and Kentucky south to Florida and Louisiana.Li, J., Del Tredici, P., Yang, S., & Donoghue, M.

They are shrubs and trees, mostly deciduous, though some species (e.g. S. pteropetiolata) are evergreen; the evergreen species form a genetically distinct group and are split into a separate genus Hartia by some botanists, but others retain them within Stewartia.Flora of China draft account of Theaceae The Asian species include both shrubs and trees, growing to 3‚Äì20 m tall, while the American species are shrubs growing 3‚Äì5 m tall, rarely becoming small trees. The bark is very distinctive, smooth orange to yellow-brown, peeling in fine flakes. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, serrated, usually glossy, and 3‚Äì14 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 3‚Äì11 cm diameter, with 5 (occasionally 6-8) white petals; flowering is in mid to late summer. The fruit is a dry five-valved capsule, with one to four seeds in each section. The species are adapted to acidic soils, and do not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. They also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought. Etymology The genus was named in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus to honour John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Owing to a transcription error, Linnaeus was given the name as 'Stewart', and consequently spelled the name \\"Stewartia\\" (and continued to do so in all his subsequent publications).

The different dual topologies for a given dual pair are characterized by the Mackey‚ÄìArens theorem. All locally convex topologies with their continuous dual are trivially a dual pair and the locally convex topology is a dual topology. Several topological properties depend only on the dual pair and not on the chosen dual topology and thus it is often possible to substitute a complicated dual topology by a simpler one.

Together with David Ruelle, he predicted that fluid turbulence could develop through a strange attractor, a term they coined, as opposed to the then-prevailing theory of accretion of modes. The prediction was later confirmed by experiment. Takens also established the result now known as the Takens's theorem, which shows how to reconstruct a dynamical system from an observed time-series. Takens was born in Zaandam in the Netherlands. He attended schools in The Hague and in Zaandam before serving in the Dutch army for one year (1960‚Äì1961).

S&H; Green Stamps was a line of trading stamps popular in the United States from the 1930s until the late 1980s. They were distributed as part of a rewards program operated by the Sperry & Hutchinson company (S&H;), founded in 1896 by Thomas Sperry and Shelley Byron Hutchinson. During the 1960s, the company promoted its rewards catalog as being the largest publication in the United States and boasted that it issued three times as many stamps as the U.S. Postal Service. Customers would receive stamps at the checkout counter of supermarkets, department stores, and gasoline stations among other retailers, which could be redeemed for products in the catalog. Top Value Stamps, acquired by Tom Ficara in 1990 and now a division of TVS Television Network, and S&H; are the only two surviving legacy stamp programs. S&H; Green Stamps had several competitors, including Greenbax Stamps offered by Piggly Wiggly, Gold Bell Gift Stamps (in the Midwest), Triple S Stamps (offered by Grand Union Supermarkets), Gold Bond Stamps, Blue Chip Stamps, Plaid Stamps (a project of A&P; Supermarkets), Top Value Stamps, Quality Stamps, Gunn Brothers given by Safeway, Buccaneer, and Eagle Stamps (a project of several divisions of the May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis, Missouri and offered, notably, by May Company stores, supermarkets, drug stores, gas stations, and dry cleaners in the Cleveland, Ohio, area).

Shows the stamps and gives a description of the programs and offers. =Beginnings= Sperry & Hutchinson began offering stamps to U.S. retailers in 1896. The retail organizations that distributed the stamps were primarily supermarkets, gasoline filling stations, and stores. They bought the stamps from S&H; and gave them as bonuses to shoppers based on the dollar amount of a purchase. The stamps were issued in denominations of one, ten, and fifty points, perforated with a gummed reverse. As shoppers accumulated the stamps, they moistened the reverse and mounted them in collector's books, which were provided free by S&H.; The books contained 24 pages and filling a page required 50 points, so each book contained 1,200 points. Shoppers could then exchange filled books for premiums, including housewares and other items, from the local Green Stamps store or catalog. Each premium was assigned a value expressed by the number of filled stamp books required to obtain it. =Classification= Green Stamps were one of the first retail loyalty programs, by which retailers purchased the stamps from the operating company and then gave them away at a rate determined by the merchant. Some shoppers would choose one merchant over another because they gave out more stamps per dollar spent. =International= The company also traded overseas. During the early 1960s, it initiated S&H; Pink Stamps in the United Kingdom, having been beaten to their green shield trademark during 1958 by Richard Tompkins's Green Shield Trading Stamp Company. =Decline= Economic factors The program had its greatest popularity during the mid-1960s, but a series of recessions during the 1970s decreased sales of green stamps and the stamp programs of their competitors. The value of the rewards declined substantially during the same period, requiring either far more stamps to get a worthwhile item or spending money for an item that was barely discounted from the price at regular stores, creating a general downward spiral as fewer and fewer people saw them as worth the trouble. Legal issues In 1972, the company was brought before the United States Supreme Court for violating the unfairness doctrine. In FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co., the court held that restricting the trade of the stamps was illegal. Sperry and Hutchinson was sold by the founders' successors in 1981. In 1999, it was purchased from a holding firm by a member of the founding Sperry family. At that time, only about 100 U.S. stores were offering Green Stamps. On-line factors Eventually, with the rise of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the company modified its practices, and offered \\"greenpoints\\" as rewards for online purchases. The Greenpoints could be earned and redeemed at only a few stores, such as Foodtown in New York state and New Jersey. =Renaissance= Anthony Zolezzi, founder of Pet Promise and Greenopolis Recycling, reportedly purchased the company in 2013 with plans to relaunch it. Furniture division Between 1969 and 1971, Sperry & Hutchinson bought four furniture companies, which became part of a Richmond, Virginia-based furniture division in 1974. While S&H; bought other furniture companies, the first four became a High Point, North Carolina-based division called S&H; Furniture in 1976. In 1981, S&H; executives bought the division along with other investors, forming LADD Holding Co. in 1981 and LADD Furniture Inc. in 1983.See International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 12.

He spent time with his uncle, who managed the estate of his extended family. After finishing his secondary studies, Fernow spent a year in the Prussian forest service. He then studied at the University of K√∂nigsberg and the Royal Prussian Academy of Forestry at M√ºnden, his studies being interrupted for military service in the Franco-Prussian War. Before graduating from college, he met Olivia Reynolds, an American woman accompanying her brother during his studies in Germany. They got engaged, and he followed her to the United States. Married in 1879, the couple had five children. Olivia actively helped him in the many aspects of his work.https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HOSMER60.pdf  American forester  He emigrated to the United States in 1876, leaving an upset family in Germany who had been expecting him to manage the family estate. He found little market in the United States for his skills as a professional forester, and worked various odd jobs until 1878 when he got a job in Pennsylvania managing the 15,000 acres of woods which were used to obtain charcoal for the foundry of Cooper-Hewitt and Co. Fernow's observation and works like Report on the Forests of North America (Charles S. Sargent, 1884) showed him the need for proper forest management in the U.S., and he lectured on the subject. Through his job and trade connections, he got to know Abram S. Hewitt, who was influential in President Grover Cleveland's decision to give Fernow a job at the USDA.  USDA Division of Forestry  Fernow became chief of the USDA's Division of Forestry in 1886. His main policy goals were the establishment of a national forest system and introduction of scientific forest management. He produced many scientific reports while working toward the creation of national forests to protect watersheds. Displays that Fernow prepared for the forestry exhibit at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair played a prominent role in generating public support for establishing a Prussian-style national forest service and system for educating professional foresters in the United States.Twight, B.W. 1990. Bernhard Fernow and Prussian forestry in America. J For 88(2):21-25  Academic career  = Cornell University = In 1898 Fernow left the Division of Forestry to become the first dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell, the first four-year forestry school in the United States. The program's life was short, being closed in 1903 following a veto of state appropriations by New York governor Benjamin Barker Odell, Jr. in response to a conflict over the direction and management of the School's experimental forest in Franklin County, New York. In his veto message Governor Odell said: \\"The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University.\\"Charles Z.

(1963) Education & Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, Cornell University Press, p.161. As the School's director, Fernow played a central role in this controversy. He had organized a plan to demonstrate how the northern hardwood forests of the area, which had previously been logged of their large spruce and white pine timber by former owners, the Santa Clara Lumber Company, could be replanted with higher-value conifers, especially white pine. The plan drew criticism from adjacent landowners who successfully lobbied the State to oppose it because it involved clearcutting a total of of forestland at the rate several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers.Lassoie, J, R. Oglesby, and P. Smallidge. 1998. Roots of American forestry education: Trials and tribulations at Cornell University. Forest History today (1998):21-25.R.T. Ogelsby and H.B. Brumsted. ca. 1998.

Logging railroads of the Adirondacks. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks flying from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on logging slash.

Black River in the North Country, p.89, Prospect Books,1963 Nevertheless, Fernow had a long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The management plan had the backing of Cornell's president Schurman, and was found to be technically sound, if imperfectly carried out, by Fernow's contemporaries who practiced forestry in Europe and America.Anonymous. 1905.

Still, the controversy resulted in Fernow's most notable professional failure, and has been seen in retrospect as evidence of his weakness at operating in the public arena to gain public and political support for forest management.Maunder, E.R. 1960. Oral history interview with Ralph S. Hosmer. Forest History Society. Durham NC. = Subsequent positions = After leaving Cornell, Fernow became the nation's first consulting forester, with an office in New York City. In 1907, he became the first professor of forestry in a four-year baccalaureate degree program at the Pennsylvania State University, in State College. After teaching the 1907 spring semester at Penn State, Fernow left to become the first head of the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Toronto. He gave as a reason for leaving Penn State an argument with Joseph Rothrock, head of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy, over the future of that school. In 1907, Fernow became the founding Dean of the University of Toronto's Faculty of Forestry, Canada's first university school devoted to forest science. He served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Forestry, which he had started at Cornell in 1902, until his death in 1923.Hosmer, R.S. 1923. Dr. Fernow's life work. J Forest 21:320-323. He became a member of the Commission of Conservation of Canada on its organization in 1910.  Harriman Expedition  In 1899, Fernow was recruited as a member of New York's E. H. Harriman expedition to Alaska along with fellow Cornellian Louis Agassiz Fuertes. The expedition set sail from Seattle on May 31, 1899 aboard the refitted steamer, the George W. Elder. \\"His research on the expedition was hampered by the fact that the coastal itinerary never gave him a look at the inland forests. His overview thus limited, he concluded that Alaska would never be a great source of timber: the wood was inferior and the conditions of lumbering too difficult. Some say that history has proven him wrong, but his opinion did have an effect: for a time, it discouraged commercial interests from prospecting for timber in the Alaskan forests.\\"  Legacy  Fernow's reputation and legacy may have suffered because of the success and efforts of Pinchot and others who did not share Fernow's Prussian-style vision for professional forestry in America;Lewis, J.G. 2000.

Other Power Shift Conferences are also being organised by members of the International Youth Climate Movement including Africa, Japan and India. The focus of the events is on climate change policy.  History  Logo of the 2009 Power Shift conference The first Power Shift conference was held from November 2 to 5, 2007 in Washington D.C., and was organised by the Energy Action Coalition. The second American conference occurred two years later on February 27 to March 2, 2009. Following on from the success of the American format, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition organised a Power Shift event in Sydney, Australia, on July 11 to July 13, 2009. Similarly, the UK Youth Climate Coalition has scheduled the first British version of the event to run from October 9 to October 12, 2009. The first New Zealand Power Shift will be run between the 7th and 9 December 2012 in Auckland. The aim of the Power Shift Conferences is to build the youth climate movement in their respective nations, which is achieved through workshops, expert panel discussions, keynote speakers, and a lobby day or a \\"Day of Action\\" as it is alternatively known.

The first Power Shift Conference took place from November 2 to 5 in 2007 with between 5,000 and 6,000 students and young people in attendance. It is claimed that due to the number of young people who attended the conference, it became the largest activist youth event on climate change in history. At the University of Maryland, College Park, a rally of between 2,000 and 3,000 people on the steps of the Capitol building and a Lobby Day. The event was also attended by a number of keynote speakers which included Al Gore. The main aim of the first conference was to urge elected officials to pass legislation which would include three planks taken from the platform of the climate advocacy coalition 1Sky: *The creation of a 5 million-strong Clean Energy Job Corps *The reduction of greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, which scientists say is the baseline for mitigating the worst effects of global warming *A moratorium on new coal plants and divestment from fossil fuel and highway subsidies. On February 27 to March 2, 2009, the second American Power Shift Conference took place. Similarly to the first summit, it included workshops, panel discussions, and speakers focusing on addressing climate change and environmental justice. Casper ter Kuile the co-director of the UK Youth Climate Coalition states that it is more than a youth movement, it is \\"social movement\\" . This time, keynote speakers included Van Jones, Bill McKibben of 350.org, Ralph Nader, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The third American Power Shift took place April 15 to 18, 2011, in Washington, D.C., at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The conference had over 10,000 attenders. People came to support various environmental movements, many in protest of President Barack Obama's alleged weakness on environmental issues. Guest speakers included former U.S. vice-president Al Gore, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford, and environmental advocate Van Jones. The fourth Power Shift conference in the US was also the first outside of Washington. It was instead held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center on October 19‚Äì21, 2013. Keynote speakers included Gasland director Josh Fox, Sierra Club director Michael Brune, and Kandi Mossett of the Indigenous Environmental Network. The program included a rally against coal production and the organization of protests against the Keystone XL Pipeline. = The 2006 PowerShift Conferences = In 2006, a series of student conferences on energy security were organized under the name PowerShift by the 20/20 Vision Education Fund, a 501(c)3 organization based out of Maryland. (They were not affiliated with the 2007 and later Power Shift conferences organized by the Energy Action Coalition.) Over 250 people participated in the first conference which took place in Kalamazoo, MI on April 1, 2006, and featured former Central Intelligence Agency director Jim Woolsey giving a keynote speech on U.S. oil dependence and national security. The conferences also featured a simulated energy wargame called Oil Shockwave, developed by non-profit groups Securing America's Future Energy (SAFE) and the National Commission on Energy Policy. The website for the conference series has been taken down, but is viewable using the Internet Wayback Machine.  Australian Power Shift conferences  Two years later in 2009, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, in partnership with the University of Western Sydney, GetUp and Greenpeace, organised the Australian Power Shift Conference on July 11 to 13, 2009. Approximately 1,500 young people attended the summit. Guests included former Vice President of the United States Al Gore, the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the actress Brooke Satchwell. The event concluded with a flashmob action outside the Sydney Opera House. In 2010, the AYCC held three regional Power Shift Conferences in Adelaide, Canberra and Geelong. In 2011, the AYCC organised Power Shift Conferences in Perth and Brisbane with over 1,000 young people. Speakers included Bill McKibben, Kumi Naidoo, Anna Rose, Dick Smith and Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki. In 2013 the AYCC will hold Australia's largest ever Power Shift, in Melbourne from the 13‚Äì15 July.  Canadian Power Shift conference  The first Canadian Power Shift event was held from October 23 to October 26, 2009, in Ottawa, Ontario, by the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition. Subsequent summits were held in Ottawa, ON in 2012; Victoria, BC in 2013; Halifax, NS in 2014; and Edmonton, AB in 2016.  New Zealand Power Shift summit  A collaboration between 350.org Aotearoa and Generation Zero, a student environmental movement, and other individuals, will bring \\"Power Shift NZ-Pacific\\" to New Zealand for the first time between the 7th and 9 December 2012 at the University of Auckland. Confirmed speakers so far include; American Environmentalist Bill McKibben, Mayor of Auckland Len Brown and Xena: Warrior Princess actress Lucy Lawless.  UK Power Shift conferences  From 9‚Äì12 October 2009, the UK version of Power Shift was held at the Institute of Education in London. Modelled on a similar event to one organised by the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and carrying the same name as the Energy Action Coalition event in the US, the event intended to develop the youth climate movement and provide young people with training on public speaking. The training was based on the techniques developed by Marshall Ganz, a civil rights activist who is credited with devising the successful grassroots organizing model and public narrative training for 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign. The Power Shift event intended to serve as a feeder to the International Day of Action organised by 350.org on October 24. A PowerShift UK event scheduled in 2011 was cancelled, but large-scale youth climate movement events have been taking place annually under the name Shared Planet since 1999, organised by the UK's largest student-led climate campaigning network People & Planet. On 3‚Äì4 May 2014 a Power Shift UK event was held in London, titled 'Breaking Down the Barriers and Diversifying the Climate Movement'. Open to people from all walks of society who want to contribute to action on climate change, the event brought people across the UK together for a weekend of discussions and workshops, to share stories and ideas for action, and to challenge assumptions about diversifying the climate movement.

History The company was founded in 1852 by Macgregor Laird, the younger son of the shipbuilder William Laird, and based in Birkenhead. The main focus of the company at first was trading with the Niger River area and other west African ports, bringing west-African palm oil back to Britain. The monthly mail steamer to the then Gold Coast (now Ghana), appointed by Royal Charter, came with a subsidy of 30,000 pounds sterling per year from the British government, starting from 1852. In 1864 the African Steamship Company was taken over by Fletcher & Parr of Liverpool and, in turn, in 1891 absorbed into Elder Dempster & Co.. The company proved sufficiently successful that in 1869 a rival company, the British and African Steam Navigation Company, was founded, but both companies later came to an arrangement on sailing times. The business of the African Steamship company was purchased by Elder, Dempster and Company, Limited in 1891, who had bought the British and African Steam Navigation Company two years earlier, although both companies continued operating as distinct organisations. Further expansion began with a transatlantic route using large cargo vessels, trading from Liverpool to the St Lawrence River and from Liverpool to the southern ports of the United States. A later route from Bristol to St Lawrence was also established. The company also diversified into a number of businesses related to the trade, including a bank, oil-mills for processing the palm oil, a hotel in Grand Canary for tourists, and a fruit brokerage in London to deal with the banana trade. Trade with the West Indies began in 1901, with a direct, fortnightly service from Avonmouth to Jamaica, subsidised by the Colonial Office. As part of Elder Dempster, the company was bought by Sir Owen Philipp's Royal Mail Group in 1909.

He was also named president of the general council of the French d√©partement of Mont-Blanc by Napoleon I. The son of shopkeepers, Leborgne was a career military man. He was trained in European regiments and then became a success in India in the service of Mahadaji Sindhia of Gwalior in central India, who ruled over the Maratha Empire. Sindhia entrusted him with the creation and organization of an army. He became its general, and trained and commanded a force of nearly 100,000 men organized on the European model, which allowed the Maratha Empire to dominate north India and be the last native state of Hindustan to resist the British Empire. Along with his career in the army, Beno√Æt de Boigne also worked in commerce and administration. Among other titles, he became a Jaghirdar which gave him enormous land holdings in India. After a turbulent life, Beno√Æt de Boigne returned to Europe, first to England, where he married a French emigrant after having repudiated his first, Persian wife; then to France during the Consulate, and finally back to Savoy (then an independent kingdom). He devoted the end of his life to charity in Chamb√©ry, where he was born. The king of Sardinia gave him the title of Count. Early life He was born at Chamb√©ry in Savoy on 24 March 1751, the son of a fur merchant. His paternal grandfather, born at Burneuil in Picardy, moved to Chamb√©ry, in the Dukedom of Savoy, at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1709 the grandfather married Claudine Latoud, born in 1682. They had thirteen children, of whom only four reached the age of twenty, and opened up a fur shop on rue Tupin in Chamb√©ry. Fur shop of the time This shop made an impression on the young Beno√Æt Leborgne. In his M√©moires, he wrote that he was fascinated by the exotic sign outside the shop. It was brightly colored and featured wild animals including lions, elephants, panthers and tigers, with the motto underneath: \\"You can go ahead and try something else, you will all come to Leborgne, the fur dealer.\\" The child's imagination was stimulated, and he kept asking his parents and grandparents about the animals. He wanted to know more about the far-off countries where they lived. His father, Jean-Baptiste Leborgne, born in 1718, frequently traveled on business to wild-fur markets and brought back bearskins, fox, beaver, and marten furs, and many other animal pelts. Sometimes he traveled as far as Scotland, and he dreamed of going to the Indies. His wife was against this, but he passed his dream on to his son. His mother, H√©l√®ne Gabet, born in 1744, was born into a family of notaries who worked closely with the Savoy Senate. Although her family was not happy about her marriage to a fur merchant, they accepted it. Beno√Æt was the third of the couple's seven children ‚Äì three boys and three girls. One of his brothers, Antoine-Fran√ßois, became a monk at the monastery of Grande Chartreuse, but influenced by ideas of the French Revolution, he left and later married. His son Joseph became a notable lawyer in Turin. Beno√Æt, who had been destined for the law, was not the only adventurer in his family. His brother Claude went to Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic. Claude was imprisoned in Paris during the Reign of Terror, and later became a deputy for the island of Santo Domingo (now called Hispaniola) in the Council of Five Hundred under the French Directory. During the first empire (of Napoleon) he was named to office in Paris and took the title of Baron. This title was given to him, like the title of Count given to his brother Beno√Æt Leborgne, by the king of Sardinia, in 1816. At the age of 17, Beno√Æt Leborgne fought a duel with a Piedmont officer and wounded him. This cost him his chance to join the Brigade de Savoie. He therefore enlisted in the French Army. Early military career Portrait engraving of de Boigne by Gouti√®re, 1835. Leborgne began his military career in the north of France in 1768, as an ordinary soldier in Louis XV's Irish Regiment, directed by Lord Clare and quartered in Flanders. This regiment was made up mostly of Irish emigrants who did not want to serve the British; at this time Irish Catholics were disenfranchised in their own country under the anti-Catholic penal laws. During this period, many Irishmen left Ireland for the Catholic countries of Europe or for North America. Here Beno√Æt Leborgne learned English and the rudiments of army life. He listened to the military tales of his superior officers, especially those of Major Daniel Charles O'Connell about India. Many years later, he met O'Connell again in England and was introduced through him to his future wife Ad√®le. While in the Irish Regiment, Leborgne took part in several campaigns which took him across Europe, as well as to islands in the Indian Ocean, including Bourbon Island (now called R√©union). In 1773, at age 22, Beno√Æt Leborgne resigned from the army. Lord Clare and Colonel Meade had died, bringing changes to the Regiment. Europe was at peace and his chances of promotion had become slim. The Russian-Turkish war As he was leaving the Irish Regiment, young Leborgne learned from the newspapers that Prince Fyodor Grigoryevich Orlov of Russia was raising, in the name of Empress Catherine II of Russia, a Greek regiment to attack the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Russia was attempting to extend its territory to acquire a port on the Black Sea, and was using the anti-Turkish sentiments of people under Ottoman domination to aid its project. Leborgne saw a chance of advancement and adventure. He went back to Chamb√©ry for a short time and got a letter of recommendation to Prince Orlov through the cousin of a client of his mother's, who was a close acquaintance of the prince. First Leborgne went to Turin, which was then the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, where he met the cousin. Afterwards, he went to the Veneto, then crossed to the Aegean Sea. He arrived in Paros, where Prince Orlov was forming his Greek- Russian regiment. The prince accepted him and he joined the ranks. Leborgne quickly saw that his enlistment was a mistake. The prince confided to him his doubts on the future military campaign and its chances of victory. These pessimistic forecasts were quickly confirmed. On the island of Tenedos, the Turks were victorious, and the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) ended for Leborgne with his capture by the Turks, although some members of his regiment succeeded in escaping. He was taken to Constantinople and became a slave, where he had to do menial work for many weeks. However, his owner soon noticed that he could speak English and put him to work dealing with the British Lord Algernon Percy. Percy, surprised to see a European slave, was able to procure Leborgne's freedom after a week of negotiations, with the aid of the British embassy. Preparations for India Warren Hastings, engraving from a portrait by Joshua Reynolds Lord Percy took Leborgne as a guide through the Greek islands back to Paros, where Leborgne officially resigned from his regiment. He was free again, but had only his last pay received from before his resignation. He travelled to Smyrna (now Izmir), which at the time was a prosperous, booming city. There, Leborgne met merchants from many countries, including India, which was believed to hold much wealth, like the diamonds of Golconda and the sapphires of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Some of these merchants told him their theories about the existence of trade routes passing north of India, in upper Kashmir or along the glaciers of Karakoram. He also learned that many rajahs regularly sought out European officers to organize and command their armies. These stories persuaded Leborgne to try his chances. Through his friend Lord Percy, he was able to get letters of recommendation to Lord Hastings and Lord Macartney in India. He also asked for letters of recommendation from Prince Orlov in Saint Petersburg, where the prince obtained an audience for him with the Empress Catherine II. Leborgne explained to her he wanted to discover new trade routes to India passing through Afghanistan or Kashmir. The empress, wishing to extend her power to Afghanistan, agreed to help him. At the end of 1777, Leborgne began a journey with many detours. After having tried to travel by land, he gave up and decided to reach India by ship. However, during the voyage to Egypt, a storm washed away all his possessions, including the letters of recommendation. Not wishing to abandon his journey, Leborgne went to the British consulate in Egypt and met Sir Baldwin. After a number of discussions, he was advised to take service in the British East India Company, and he was given a letter of recommendation to this effect. Military glory and fortune in India In the late 18th century, the mighty Maratha Empire was gradually collapsing. The British were triumphing over their Portuguese, French, and Dutch rivals in India, where all the countries had hastened to install trading posts. The British East India Company was the most powerful military and economic force and came to dominate India, including its princes. The British established a powerful colonial administration placed under the direct responsibility of the British Crown. Many Europeans benefited from the political confusion of India, offering their services as mercenaries to Indian princes and becoming rich merchants themselves. The Europeans had the advantage of military experience in the European wars, knowledge of arms production, especially cannons, and of new military strategies. Arrival in India In 1778, Leborgne arrived at the Indian port of Madras (now Chennai). He was poor and to make a living, taught fencing. While teaching, he met a nephew of the British governor of the city, Sir Thomas Rumbold. He was offered a position as an officer in the 6th battalion of sepoys, a troop of local inhabitants raised by the Company. He accepted, and gradually learned the local customs and began training the sepoys. He lived in Madras for four years, but became restless. He was ambitious, and decided to go to Delhi in the north of India, where the Moghul Emperor Shah Alam II held court. The Marathas and Rajputs were employing Europeans and giving them the command of their armies. The new governor, Lord MacCartney, gave Leborgne letters of recommendation to the governor of the province of Bengal, in Calcutta, and Leborgne sailed there. He met governor Warren Hastings, who approved his projects of exploration. Again he was given letters of recommendation, this time to Asaf-Ud-Dowlah, the Nawab of Oudh, in Lucknow. The rajah was a vassal of the British. In January 1783, Leborgne started his trip. He traveled through many extremely poor villages, learning about the culture and religion of India and noted the different Muslim and Hindu neighborhoods in various places. Arrival in Lucknow Image:PolierMartinWombwellZoffany.jpgthumb300pxPainting of Antoine-Louis Polier, Johann Zoffany, Claude Martin and John Wombwell. rect 269 140 344 305 Claude Martin rect 124 147 181 298 Antoine-Louis Polier desc none In Lucknow, Leborgne was received by the nabab Asaf-ud-Daulah and was invited to live with Colonel Pollier, in the service of the Company. As Middleton, an Englishman present when Leborgne met the nabab, explained to him afterward, this invitation was in fact an order; if he refused he would have been thrown in prison. Colonel Antoine Polier, a Swiss, received him warmly. Leborgne discovered that Lucknow had many European residents. He met two who spoke French. The first, Claude Martin, was from Lyons and had made his fortune in India; the second, Drugeon, was from Savoy like himself. The nabab gave Leborgne a kelat, richly decorated with gold and diamonds, along with letters of exchange for Kandahar and Kabul, and 12,000 rupees. The nabab kept Leborgne, with many others, as a privileged captive for five months. Polier explained to Leborgne that although he had been given the letters of exchange, he would have to be patient. While waiting, Leborgne began to learn Persian and Hindi. He also changed his name at this time to sound more aristocratic. From then on he called himself de Boigne, inspired by the English pronunciation of his name (English-speakers could not pronounce the \\"r\\" correctly). Along with Claude Martin, his friend from Lyons, de Boigne occupied himself by selling silver jewelry, silk carpets, and arms enameled in gold. He also went tiger-hunting on elephant-back with Polier and the nabab. Leaving Lucknow for Delhi Portrait of Beno√Æt de Boigne by Boilly, 1823. In August 1783, de Boigne received permission to leave Oudh and went north to search for new trade routes. His journey by horse led him to Delhi in the company of Polier, who also had to go there for business. During the trip, de Boigne saw the Taj Mahal and other Indian sights, including various smaller kingdoms and tribes. In Delhi, an Englishman named Anderson offered to get de Boigne an audience with Emperor Shah Alam, whose court was at the Red Fort. During this audience, de Boigne told the emperor about his proposal to seek new trade routes, but the emperor put off any decision (\\"We'll see\\"). De Boigne waited in Delhi, hoping for a favorable answer. However, circumstances were about to change. The day after the audience, an imperial edict gave Mahadji Sindhia the government of the provinces of Delhi and Agra. In other words, Sindhia became the imperial regent and the real power, while Emperor Shah Alam, without being deposed, was now only a figurehead. In 1790, de Boigne summarized Indian politics of the time: \\"The respect toward the house of Timur [the Moghul dynasty] is so strong that even though the whole subcontinent has been withdrawn from its authority, no prince of India has taken the title of sovereign. Sindhia shared this respect, and Shah Alam [Shah Alam II] was still seated on the Moghul throne, and everything done in his name.\\" In the midst of these political upheavals, de Boigne met Armand de Levassoult, a European friend of Polier. Levassoult was in the service of Begum Joanna Nobilis (Begum Samru of Sardana, d. 1836), an influential woman respected by the emperor, but also by his Maratha adversaries. For a few days, de Boigne found himself in Delhi unable to go north, since the local administration did not give him permission. However, he met Levassoult again and Levassoult invited him to go to Sindhia's camp with him. Doubted by Marathas, betrayed by Jaipur Fort of Gwalior The Marathas had set up camp to besiege the citadel of Gwalior, in which a Scot named George Sangster, whom de Boigne had met in Lucknow, was commanding the garrison. When Levassoult and de Boigne arrived in the Maratha camp, they received a warm welcome. Levassoult presented his friend as the bravest of soldiers, and de Boigne was given a tent. However, while he was away from it, his baggage was stolen, and with it the precious letters of exchange of Hastings and also the letter for Kabul and Peshawar. He soon learned that this theft had been ordered by Sindhia himself, who wanted to know more about this suspect European. De Boigne, wanting revenge, decided to send a discreet message to Sangster in the besieged citadel and proposed an attack on the Maratha camp. But while he was waiting for the answer, he was called by an enraged Sindhia who had discovered the message. De Boigne had to explain that his act was a response to the theft of his baggage and letters of exchange. Sindhia discussed with De Boigne about an expedition to the north of India and a resulting possible invasion by the Afghans. He then offered to de Boigne the command of the camp guard, which de Boigne refused. Vexed, Sindhia dismissed him without returning his precious papers. This misadventure showed de Boigne that his project of exploration was unpopular among Indians, and he decided to abandon it. His argument with Sindhia came to the ears of Sindhia's enemies, first to those of the Rajah of Jaipur, who was looking for a European officer to form two battalions. De Boigne accepted the offer and returned to Lucknow to raise and train the troops. The British, suspicious, asked de Boigne to explain himself to Hastings, who, after hearing his intentions, allowed him to continue. Once the battalions were recruited and operational, de Boigne and his men started for Jaipur. However, en route they were stopped at Dholpur by a local petty lord whose fortress blocked the only passage. After they gave him a ransom, he allowed them to pass. This episode displeased the Rajah of Jaipur, who dismissed de Boigne without any compensation, while keeping the two new battalions. In the service of the Maratha empire After a time wandering, de Boigne again met his friend Levassoult, who introduced him to the Catholic convert Begum Joanna. She confided to him that Sindhia, the Maratha chief wanted him back. Although Sindhia had been mistrustful of de Boigne's projects of exploration, and in spite of their argument over the confiscated baggage, Sindhia had been impressed with de Boigne's two European-trained battalions, which contrasted sharply with his own troops. De Boigne finally agreed to enter the service of the Marathas. He was put in charge of organizing a cannon foundry in Agra, as well as equipping and arming 7000 men in two battalions. De Boigne from this time quickly became an influential man. One of the first actions under his command was the October 1783 capture of the citadel of Kalinjar in the region of Bundelkhand. The rajah of this region ended up parleying with de Boigne, which allowed Sindhia to enter Delhi as its master. The Maratha chief named himself \\"Column of the Empire\\" and Prime Minister. His seizure of power led to many conflicts and betrayals. Over the next few years there were many battles among Marathas, Mughals, Kachwahas and Rathores. At the battles of Lalsot (May 1787) and of Chaksana (24 April 1788), de Boigne and his two battalions proved their worth by holding the field when the Marathas were losing. The year 1788 was especially turbulent. On August 10, Gholam Kadir had the Emperor Shah Alam's eyes torn out. On August 14, the Maratha army, allied with the army of Begum Joanna and of that of her old enemy Ismail Beg, entered Delhi, retaking the town it had once lost. Kadir escaped but was captured, and the Marathas killed him gruesomely, among other tortures putting out his eyes and cutting off his ears and nose. His corpse was then given to the emperor. Once more Mahadji Sindhia had triumphed and was now the true power in India. It was at this time that Beno√Æt de Boigne proposed to Sindhia the creation of a brigade of 10,000 men in order to consolidate his conquest of India. Sindhia refused because his treasury could not afford it, but also because he had doubts about the superiority of the artillery-infantry combination, as opposed to the cavalry that had been the main weapon of the Maratha armies. This refusal caused a new dispute between the two men, and Beno√Æt de Boigne resigned. Once more unemployed, he returned to Lucknow. Commercial life and first marriage Back in Lucknow, Beno√Æt de Boigne found his old friends Antoine-Louis Polier and Claude Martin. Martin persuaded de Boigne to work with him in trade. His military skills were useful, for at the time, Indian trade routes were dangerous, and even warehouses in the cities were sometimes robbed. Claude Martin and Beno√Æt de Boigne built a warehouse inside an old fort. It included saferooms and a trained armed guard to watch it. Quickly, this business became successful. De Boigne also carried on a trade in precious stones, copper, gold, silver, indigo, cashmere shawls, silks, and spices. He became rich and now owned a luxurious house with many servants, a wine-cellar, and valuable horses. At this time, de Boigne fell in love with a young woman from Delhi named Noor Begum (\\"light\\" in Arabic). She was the daughter of a colonel in the Persian Guard of the Great Moghul, whom he had met to discuss a simple lawsuit. The same day, he asked the colonel for his daughter's hand in marriage. After a long discussion, the father accepted, even though de Boigne refused to convert to Islam as was normally required for the husband of a Muslim woman. De Boigne wooed Noor, who could speak perfect English. The wedding lasted several days, first in Delhi, with sumptuous feasts, then more simply in Lucknow. The couple had two children, a daughter born in 1790 and a son in 1791. A general in the service of the Maratha empire, with the title of jaghir Portrait of Beno√Æt de Boigne after the battle of Patan. In 1788, Sindhia sent a discreet message to de Boigne. Sindhia wished to unite north and northwest India. At the time, the Rajputs and the Marathas had a tense relationship. The Marathas were levying the peasants with more taxes. Sindhia succeeded in convincing de Boigne to return to his service. He asked him to organize a brigade of 12,000 men within a year (January 1789-January 1790). De Boigne became commander-in- chief and general, the highest title under \\"rajah.\\" To be able to pay his men, Sindhia gave his new general a jaghir, a fief given for the lifetime of its holder, against a payment in return to the imperial treasury. At the death of its holder, the jaghir reverted to another deserving officer. The revenues from the jaghir allowed the officer to pay his men. Beno√Æt de Boigne received the Doab, a region of plains in Uttar Pradesh. This plain was covered with jungle and included several towns like Meerut, Koal and Aligarh. De Boigne had to use some of his savings to renovate this new land. He built a citadel and stores. The military camp built by de Boigne was very European. To work with the new brigade, he hired Drugeon from Savoy, Sangster from Scotland, John Hessing, a Dutchman, as well as Fr√©mont and Pierre Cuillier-Perron, two Frenchmen, a German named Anthony Pohlmann and an Italian, Michael Filoze. The administrative and military language became French, and the flag of Savoy, red with a white cross, became the ensign of the new brigade. Because of his high rank, Sindhia obliged de Boigne to have a personal guard, and de Boigne chose 400 Sikhs and Persians. The brigade itself consisted of approximately nine battalions of infantry, each with its own artillery and baggage train. The brigade artillery included about fifty bronze cannons, of which half were big- caliber and transported by oxen, and the other pieces by elephants and camels. De Boigne's brigade also invented a weapon composed of six musket-barrels joined together. The brigade was supported by 3000 elite cavalry, 5000 servants, team drovers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and others. A novelty for India was the ambulance corps, in charge of rescuing wounded soldiers, including enemy soldiers. De Boigne also acquired a parade elephant named Bhopal. The brigade was ready in 1790. Military campaigns and victories Starting in 1790, the brigade had to face Rajputs, Ismail Beg, and the rajahs of Bikaner and Jaipur. De Boigne decided to attack this coalition by surprise on May 23. De Boigne demonstrated his military talent by gaining one victory after another. The East India Company began to become concerned about this new Maratha army, dangerous to their domination. Within six months of 1790, in a hostile, hilly terrain, de Boigne's brigade defeated 100,000 men, confiscated 200 camels and 200 cannons, many bazaars, and fifty elephants. The Maratha army attacked and took seventeen fortresses by siege. It won several decisive battles, among which the most difficult were the battles of Patan, Mairtah, and Ajmer. The Rajputs recognized the authority of Sindhia as prime minister. The Marathas were now the masters of northern and northwestern India. During these military campaigns, de Boigne continued his commercial association with Claude Martin from a distance. Sindhia, more powerful than ever, asked de Boigne to raise two more brigades. These were formed and their command was given by de Boigne to Fr√©mont and Perron, assisted by Drugeon. For a while, de Boigne could enjoy his new social position and the respect that his victories had won him, as well as the reforms which he had undertaken in his jaghir. But the calm was of short duration, and military campaigns started up again. The Marathas of central India became a threat. Due to internal differences, a new coalition of Holkar and Sindhia's enemy Ismail Beg, menaced the territory of Sindhia in northern India, and in spite of diplomatic negotiations and promises of imperial titles, there was a battle of Lakhari in 1793 between Holkar-Ismail Beg and Sindhia. De Boigne's brigades won and captured Ismail Beg, but his life was spared because de Boigne admired his brave spirit. De Boigne now attacked Holkar and after a fourth battle, the most exciting and dangerous, according to de Boigne, his troops won another victory. However, de Boigne was weary of war. The rajah of Jaipur, now in a position of weakness, preferred peace. De Boigne was rewarded by Sindhia with an enlargement of the jaghir, and also gave a jaghir to de Boigne's son, only an infant at the time. Trusted by Maratha chiefs. European events Sindhia had become the most powerful man in India, with many enemies. As they were not able to beat him militarily, the Maratha chief faced conspiracies, intrigue and treason. De Boigne was a faithful follower and Sindhia trusted him and made him a confidant. De Boigne now was running imperial affairs for Sindhia in north and northwestern India. The minister Gopal Rao, whose brother had been engaged in a famous plot with Nana Farnavis (Nana Fadnavis), came to Aligarh to visit de Boigne to show his loyalty to Sindhia. But while India was now a confederation under the Maratha authority, the situation in Europe was changing profoundly. The French Revolution had overturned the equilibrium in Europe, and also in Europe's colonial empires. On November 12, 1792, a Savoy assembly proclaimed its unity with France. Until 1815, de Boigne was now considered a Frenchman like any other. The brigades of the Maratha army under de Boigne's command were under European officers now divided by the political situation in Europe: one of the two French officers was a royalist and the other supported the revolution. De Boigne tried to keep his army out of European politics. He was more worried about the situation of Sindhia, who was still in Poona. Sindhia ordered him to send help, as he had to struggle against British intrigues. De Boigne sent him 10,000 men under the command of Perron. On February 12, 1794, Sindhia died of high fever. De Boigne remained faithful to Daulat Rao Sindhia, the nephew and legitimate heir of Sindhia. De Boigne soon realized that the political situation had changed. His ideal of India as a confederation of free states would never come to pass. Sindhia's successor was less capable than his predecessor. In 1795, after twenty years in India, and in worsening health, de Boigne left his command, installing Perron in his place, and prepared his departure for Europe. At the end of his career in India, he was head of an army of almost 100,000 men, organized on the European model. The Maratha confederation was therefore the last indigenous state of Hindustan to resist the British. In November 1796 de Boigne left India, accompanied by his family and his most faithful Indian servants. He sold his personal guard to the British, with the consent of his men, for a price equivalent to 900,000 Francs Germinal. Return to Europe and second marriage Beno√Æt de Boigne left for England, where he installed his household near London. Although he had been born a Savoyard, the Revolution had made him a Frenchman, and therefore a potential enemy of the British. His wealth and his letters of credit were held in abeyance at the bank. However, his military prowess was known to many British who had campaigned in India, some of whom had dined with him in India. This sympathy allowed de Boigne to take British nationality on January 1, 1798. The nationality was conditional upon his remaining in Britain or its colonies. Wishing to leave London, de Boigne acquired a house in the English countryside, in Dorsetshire. He considered going back to Chamb√©ry, his native town, but the political situation was too uncertain. He also thought of entering politics, but his position was not good enough for the British parliament, since the parties expected candidates to have gone to the best British schools, have well-connected friends, and also to have a wife who could carry on diplomatic conversation and organize parties and receptions. De Boigne had his family christened, and Noor became H√©l√®ne. Although his seat was in the country, he was near London and went there often. He met many French emigrants, all waiting to be able to go back to France. In 1798, de Boigne met a Mademoiselle d'Osmond, sixteen years old. He repudiated his first wife, who had not been able to adapt to British customs and had become more and more distant, returning to her Indian habits. De Boigne was now completely taken by his new love. Not being legally married to H√©l√®ne under British law, he agreed to give her alimony and engaged a tutor for their children. On June 11, 1798, he married Ad√®le d'Osmond. Unhappy second marriage; discovery of France under the Consulate His second wife, born in 1781, was an emigrant from a penniless, though noble, old family from Normandy. De Boigne did not reveal his own lowly origins before the marriage. He seems to have wished, after his adventurous life, to start a family and establish himself in Europe through the help of his wife's high-placed relations. But from the beginning, the marriage was not a success. De Boigne had a hard time adapting to European manners after so long in India, and the 30-year difference in age between him and his wife added to the difficulty. He was jealous. He also now took opium to assuage the pain of his dysentery, and his wife and her family claimed he abused it. During this period, France was under the Consulate, and many French emigrants returned to France. De Boigne decided to go back as well, and in 1802 he settled in Paris, where the consul Napoleon Bonaparte was enjoying great popularity. De Boigne's wife went back to live with her parents. On April 30, 1802, de Boigne discovered from Drugeon, who had stayed in India, that Perron had become an important person there, but that Perron was greedy for money and seized his friend's property to get de Boigne's money and accelerate its decline. In Paris, de Boigne became friends with General Paul Thi√©bault, who asked him several times to meet Napoleon so that he could become an officer in the French army. However, de Boigne, who was now in his fifties, did not want to return to his former rank of colonel, under the orders of younger men. Although he refused, the offer was renewed. In 1803, Napoleon offered a new proposition to Beno√Æt de Boigne. He asked him to take command of Russian and French troops who would reach India through Afghanistan and chase off the British. But nothing came of this. Beno√Æt de Boigne bought the Ch√¢teau de Beauregard, La Celle-Saint-Cloud for his wife, and she moved in on November 2, 1804. The property was ceded to Francesco Borgh√®se, Prince Aldobrandini of the House of Borghese, on November 14, 1812, in exchange for a house in Ch√¢tenay (now Ch√¢tenay-Malabry). Final return to Savoy Statue of Beno√Æt de Boigne in Chamb√©ry. ch√¢teau de Lucey was one of de Boigne's properties. Beno√Æt de Boigne returned to Savoy definitively in 1807. There, he had himself called \\"General de Boigne.\\" He lived alone in the ch√¢teau of Buisson-Rond near Chamb√©ry, which he had bought in 1802 and appointed luxuriously for his young wife. But she continued to live in the Paris region, where she lived in the ch√¢teau of Beauregard and then of Ch√¢tenay. In this Parisian life she found the material for her celebrated M√©moires, which were published in 1907. The Comtesse de Boigne rarely came to Buisson-Rond, although she occasionally gave urbane receptions during the summer on her way home from taking the waters at Aix, in the company of her friends Madame R√©camier, Madame de Sta√´l, Adrien de Montmorency (Anne Adrien Pierre de Montmorency-Laval), and Benjamin Constant. Having returned from the isle of R√©union, Beno√Æt de Boigne received the title of Field Marshal on October 20, 1814, and the Croix de Saint-Louis (Order of Saint Louis) on December 6. His wife was pleased. On February 27, 1815, Louis XVIII gave him the Legion of Honor for services rendered as President of the Conseil g√©n√©ral du d√©partement du Mont-Blanc. De Boigne was a fervent royalist, and ardent partisan of the Savoy government. Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, king of Sardinia and Savoy, gave him the title of Count in 1816, and Charles Felix of Sardinia conferred upon him the Grand Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. In 1814 and 1816 he was named General in France and in Savoy. During the last years of his life, Beno√Æt de Boigne occupied himself in managing his immense fortune. He bought much land in the vicinity of Chamb√©ry and of Geneva, and also in the west of the modern d√©partement of Savoie, including, in 1816, the ch√¢teau de Lucey. He spent much of his time on the development of his native city. He was a member of the city council of Chamb√©ry in 1816. Although he no longer served in the military, he received the title of lieutenant-general in the armies of the king of Sardinia in 1822. On December 26, 1824, he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Belles-Lettres of Savoy, with the academic title \\"Effectif.\\" From 1814 until his death, de Boigne made many donations to the city of Chamb√©ry, financing public and religious organizations, for welfare, education, and public works. He had no children with Ad√®le d'Osmond, so he made the decision to legitimize and naturalize his son Charles-Alexandre from his first marriage to H√©l√®ne (Noor). On June 21, 1830, Beno√Æt de Boigne died in Chamb√©ry. He was buried inside the church of Saint-Pierre-le-L√©menc. A funeral oration was given for him on August 19, 1830, in the metropolitan church of Chamb√©ry, by the Canon Vibert, pro-vicar-general of the diocese and member of the royal academic society of Savoy. Descendants of Beno√Æt de Boigne Charles-Alexandre de Boigne was born in Delhi, India in 1791. He married C√©sarine Viallet de Montbel in 1816. The marriage had been encouraged by his father. C√©sarine Viallet de Montbel was from a large Savoy family who had been parliamentarians and later ennobled. They had thirteen children. Charles-Alexandre, educated in England, had studied law, but spent most of his life as a minor courtier at the Savoy court, managing his land and inheritance. He was assisted by Thomas Morand, a Chamb√©ry notary who had been chosen by Beno√Æt de Boigne. Charles-Alexandre also had to liquidate the foundations and donations of his father. Charles-Alexandre died on July 23, 1853. His son Ernest acceded to the title. Ernest married Delphine de Sabran- Pontev√®s. Ernest de Boigne became captain of the firemen of the city of Chamb√©ry, but soon became involved in politics. He was elected to the Savoy parliament, then became a deputy to the legislative body in 1860. He was twice reelected, as a conservative, in 1863 and 1869. He was decorated with the Legion of Honor. At the fall of the Second Empire, he lost his election in 1877. He became the mayor of Lucey. He died in 1895 at Buisson-Rond. Benefactor of Chamb√©ry Statue of Beno√Æt de Boigne at the old age home Maison Saint-Beno√Æt in Chamb√©ry At his death, Beno√Æt de Boigne left a fortune estimated at 20 million French francs of the time. Altogether, his donations to his native city amounted to about 3,484,850 francs. He left a permanent fund of 6500 pounds yearly to the metropolitan church of Chamb√©ry for, among other things, the choir. He gave a second fund of 1250 pounds to the Compagnie des nobles Chevaliers-Tireurs-√†-l'Arc (Company of noble knight archers). De Boigne gave many donations for charity, including giving beds to hospitals. He donated 22,400 francs for three hospital beds at the H√¥tel-Dieu, a charity hospital, and later gave 24,000 francs for another four beds for poor, sick foreign travelers of any nation or religion. He paid 63,000 francs for the construction of various buildings at the H√¥tel-Dieu of Chamb√©ry, and gave a beggars' home the sum of 649,150 francs. He founded an old age home, the Maison de Saint-Beno√Æt, which cost him 900,000 francs. He also paid for a place in the orphanage for 7300 francs, and ten beds at the charity hospital, for patients with contagious illnesses, who could not be admitted to H√¥tel- Dieu. De Boigne also gave a trust fund of 1650 pounds a year, about 33,000 francs, to help poor prisoners every week with laundry and food. He gave another perpetual trust of 1200 pounds or 24,000 francs to the poor \\"shameful\\" of the city, to be distributed at their homes. Finally, he left a trust fund of 1200 pounds to the firemen of Chamb√©ry to help the sick and wounded. De Boigne gave 30,000 francs to build the church of the Capucins, and 60,000 francs to build a theater. Among his other numerous donations, two were important. One was 320,000 francs for various works, as well as the ownership without usufruct of the property of Ch√¢tenay. The second donation was for 300,000 francs to demolish the cabornes [stone huts] and open up a wide avenue across the city. He also gave 30,000 francs for the repair of the city hall and 5000 francs for the bell-tower of Barberaz. De Boigne also gave four major donations to education. He gave 270,000 francs to reorganize the coll√®ge of Chamb√©ry; he gave a trust fund of 1000 pounds a year, 20,000 francs, to the Soci√©t√© royale acad√©mique de Chamb√©ry for the encouragement of agriculture, arts, and letters; he gave two trust funds of 150 pounds apiece, or 3000 francs, to the Fr√®res des √âcoles chr√©tiennes (Brothers of Christian Schools) and to the Sisters of Saint Joseph. Both of these groups gave a free education to children, the first to poor children, the second to girls. Further reading * This cites H.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 14, 1999. In the episode, Homer becomes a local celebrity after bowling a perfect game, but his fame quickly fades as \\"yesterday's news\\". After a botched suicide attempt, Homer decides to spend time with Maggie after seeing Ron Howard spend time with his children. Howard guest starred as himself in the episode, which also features guest appearances by Penn & Teller, Pat O'Brien, and Nancy O'Dell. Plot Homer is extremely late for work after sleeping for more than a whole day. As punishment for his lateness, Mr. Burns makes Homer eat toxic waste in a dark room. Lenny and Carl come in and invite Homer to go bowling. Homer lies to Marge on the phone, telling her that he was not able to attend a tea party date with Maggie because there was a breakdown at the plant and Lenny was hospitalized. Homer then goes bowling with Lenny and Carl; this scene is noted for the classic line \\"Spare me your guttermouth.\\" Homer bowls a 300 game, and makes the evening news, earning the attention of the entire town. With this accomplishment, Homer becomes a celebrity, appearing on The Springfield Squares. The appearance ends disastrously, with Homer getting into a fight with fellow celebrity guest Ron Howard, leading Kent Brockman to lament inviting a \\"flavor of the week\\" like Homer onto the show. Determined to prolong his moment in the limelight, Homer attempts a walk-on during a Penn & Teller special. This also backfires on him as Penn chases him off the stage with a crossbow (and leaves Teller slowly descending into a tub of shark- filled water). Homer's 15 minutes of fame wanes, and he becomes \\"yesterday's news\\" according to an entertainment news show. Worrying that his life has peaked, he attempts to commit suicide by jumping from a tall building, but Otto, who is bungee jumping, saves him. Thankful for being alive, Homer dedicates his life to his children after seeing Ron Howard take his children to a zoo. He tries, but fails to connect with Bart (who already has a father figure in construction workers, the Internet, and Nelson Muntz) and Lisa (who is too intellectual for him), so he decides to spend more time with Maggie. He tries to teach her how to swim, but she does not trust him and will not go in the water. When Homer takes Maggie to the beach, he gets caught in a rip current and nearly drowns. Maggie swims out and pulls him to shore. For saving him, Homer treats Maggie to a game of bowling--and she bowls a perfect game, but Homer penalizes her for going over the foul line. Production Ron Howard appears in the episode. The episode was written by Al Jean and directed Mike B. Anderson as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). Penn & Teller, Ron Howard, Pat O'Brien, Nancy O'Dell guest starred in the episode as themselves. Howard had previously guest starred on The Simpsons as himself in the season ten episode \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\" (1998). Howard was set to appear in \\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\" (2001), but dropped out for unknown reasons. The author of the 2003 book Ron Howard: From Mayberry to the Moon‚Ä¶ and Beyond, Beverly Gray, noted that by playing himself in these episodes, \\"Howard showed once again that he could laugh at his own public persona. His appearances on The Simpsons also suggest how much he remains an American icon, long after the end of his acting career. It's rare indeed for a director or producer to be as instantly recognizable as most Hollywood stars.\\" Cultural references Several references to popular culture are featured in the episode. The title is an allusion to the novelty song \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\" by comedian Allan Sherman. The song was previously used in \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\". Springfield Squares is a parody of the show Hollywood Squares. The scene in which Homer bowls the strike that wins him the perfect game takes many elements from the Robert Redford film The Natural (1984), including the camera flashes, music and slow-motion. Homer sings The Doors song \\"The End\\" when he walks through the streets considering suicide. Homer plays a Where's Waldo? game on the back of the cereal box he eats his breakfast from. While he is doing this, Waldo walks past the window behind him. After Homer bowls his perfect game, he pulls out a \\"Before I Die I want To-\\" list and checks off the item \\"Bowl a Perfect Game\\". Below that is listed \\"See Stevie Nicks Naked\\", which has been checked three times. Stevie Nicks is a singer and member of the group Fleetwood Mac. Mrs. Krabappel reads a \\"Teacher's Edition\\" of the 1973 novel Fear of Flying. When Homer and Otto descend into the sewers on the bungee rope, they pass three underground societies: the Morlocks (from the 1960 film The Time Machine), the C.H.U.D.s (from the 1984 film C.H.U.D.) and the Mole People (from the 1956 film The Mole People). Release \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 14, 1999. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Al Jean, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"this episode refers to Maggie as 'the forgotten Simpson', and they ain‚Äôt kidding. She rarely gets much attention, and for good reason: she doesn‚Äôt bring much to the series. ['Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder'] has some laughs ‚Äì particularly during a fun bit that spoofs The Natural - but its story feels like it‚Äôs all over the place. Maggie episodes are rare ‚Äì and rarely very good. That holds true for this one as well.\\" However, in his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons, Den of Geek critic Mark Oakley wrote that \\"there are some fine episodes to be found\\", such as \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\", which he described as a \\"highlight\\".

The station is owned and operated by Stony Brook University, with studios located in Stony Brook University's Student Union building. WUSB is a freeform radio station, staffed by more than 150 volunteers who devote their time and energy for the love of music and freeform radio. The station is partially listener-supported. Its transmitter is located in Farmingville, New York, broadcasting at 3600 watts at above sea level, covering most of Long Island.Predicted Coverage Area for WUSB 90.1 FM, Stony Brook, NY  History  The station began in 1962 as a carrier current station, broadcasting only within the confines of the then-new Stony Brook campus on 820 kHz on the AM band. The station was, at the time, an integral part of Stony Brook University's once-lively concert scene, which brought such bands and acts as Simon and Garfunkel, Thelonious Monk, The Grateful Dead (in their first-ever East Coast concert appearance), Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Arlo Guthrie, Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin, the Allman Brothers Band, Pink Floyd, Van Morrison, The Who, Jethro Tull, Cat Stevens, Hot Tuna, Santana, Stony Brook's own Blue √ñyster Cult, the Beach Boys, Frank Zappa, Billy Joel, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Jerry Garcia and more. Many of these musicians paid a visit to the station as well. In its earliest days, the studios were located in a \\"hole in the ground\\" in the Pritchard Gymnasium, before relocating to another cramped space in the basement of one of the dormitories, James College. One of the station's broadcasters, Paul (the Bean) Kornreich, was not only one of the station's DJ's but also its first basketball announcer. In 1975, the studios then moved to the Student Union, Room 240, where they remained until they moved to the second floor of the West Side Dining facility on January 27, 2017. In 1965, New York mandated that all of its campus radio stations across the state make the transition to FM, as part of its master plan for the university system. Since it was up to each individual school to obtain a license on its own, WUSB began a long battle to get a spot on the increasingly crowded FM dial. Efforts to get the station on FM began in 1970, originally with an attempt to purchase a plot of land near campus to build a transmitter. New York regulations, however, prevented that from happening. Ultimately, construction began on a tower at the top of the Graduate Chemistry building, which, at the time, was the tallest building on the Stony Brook campus, and approval for the construction of the new station was received from the Board of Trustees in 1973. However, WUSB's construction permit was challenged by Adelphi University, whose station, WBAU, which at the time broadcast on the first- adjacent frequency, 90.3, out of Garden City on Long Island (but which is no longer on the air), objected to the proposed station, citing potential interference to their signal. However, the FCC overruled WBAU's objections in 1976, and granted WUSB a license to begin broadcasting in 1977. At the time, WUSB was Long Island's most powerful non-commercial radio station, putting out 4,000 watts of power, primarily covering central Suffolk County. The station signed on as an FM station for the first time on June 27, 1977, at 5:30 in the afternoon. The station's first General Manager was Norm Prusslin, a University alumnus, employee, adjunct professor and advisor. He held this position continuously until his retirement in early 2006. He was later succeeded as General Manager by Isobel Breheny Schafer. Many of the station's original volunteers, including its Chief Engineer, Frank Burgert, were students in 1977. Many alumni of Stony Brook remain to this day as WUSB volunteers. Rich Koch was the station's first Program director when the station began broadcasting on FM and he also remains as an active WUSB staffer. The initial location of WUSB's antenna provided excellent coverage to the campus and much of Long Island's north shore, but the high wattage of the station began to have adverse effects on experiments conducted in laboratories of the Chemistry building, as well as those in the nearby Physics building. In the mid-1980s, it was determined that, to eliminate interference, the antenna would either have to be moved or have its power drastically reduced. It was decided to move the antenna to a new off campus location. After many potential locations were examined across Suffolk County, an agreement was reached with the owners of a new tower being constructed at Bald Hill in Farmingville, New York, one of the highest points on Long Island. WBLI had already signed on as a tenant on the new tower, and WUSB leased space on the new tower as well. However, objections were raised again, with first-adjacent stations broadcasting on 89.9 and 90.3 FM on Long Island. WUSB ultimately was able to successfully overcome these objections, and since November 1995 had broadcast from the top of the \\"Mile High\\" tower at Farmingville. The move also resulted in WUSB increasing its geographic coverage of Long Island (within its primary and secondary signal contours) by close to 100%, despite the fact that power was lowered to 3,600 watts as part of the move. An unfortunate byproduct of the move was that reception on campus worsened, due to local topography and structures creating partial barriers between the University and Bald Hill. During normal operations, WUSB's audio signal is sent from its studios to the transmitter site via a T1 line. However, the old antenna location, atop the Graduate Chemistry building, remains as an emergency alternative to the Farmingville transmitter site, as well as an emergency studio-transmitter link to the Farmingville tower. WUSB has traditionally been funded by students through the Undergraduate Student Government (formerly known as Polity). Since 1989, WUSB has held annual radiothons (originally once per year, now twice per year, in the fall and spring) to raise money from listeners to pay for the station's operating expenses. Much of the money raised goes to pay for the station's transmitter lease and fixed operating expenses. = Translator = In 2003, WUSB applied for a translator. If approved by the FCC, it would have allowed the station to rebroadcast its signal on 98.3 FM on the North Shore. It would also improve the signal in other areas, such as the main campus where there are dead spots or interference from other stations. This application was dismissed in 2013. The station applied for another translator to broadcast on 107.3 FM, and received a construction permit from the FCC in 2013. A license to cover was accepted on January 6, 2017.

He has been called the \\"father of the profession\\" in Glasgow. Notable works include Hutchesons' Hall, Nelson Monument in Glasgow Green and Lennox Castle. The Royal Exchange in Queen Street is David Hamilton's best known building in Glasgow. It was completed in 1829, built around an existing mansion house dating from 1778. It now serves as the city's Gallery of Modern Art. In 1835, Hamilton came third in the competition to design the Houses of Parliament (London) and won ¬£500. He was the only Scottish architect to win a prize for his entry. He is known to have been sculpted by both William Mossman and Patric Park.http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=mossman_w Thomas Gildard and John Thomas Rochead were trained by him.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Gildard  Gallery of his work  Image:Wfm goma glasgow.jpgFa√ßade of the Gallery of Modern Art on Queen Street, Glasgow Image:Eglinton Castle & Tournament Bridge 1884.jpgThe Eglinton Tournament Bridge as designed by David Hamilton.

Paull. \\"West Indian Almond Terminalia catappa L. Combretaceae\\" p. 273-276. Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts. 2008, J. Janick and R. E. Paull, editors. CABI, Wallingford, United Kingdom. Common names in English include country almond, Indian almond, Malabar almond, sea almond, tropical almond, beach almond and false kamani.A.K. Kepler. Trees of Hawaii. Description The tree grows to tall, with an upright, symmetrical crown and horizontal branches. Terminalia catappa has corky, light fruit that are dispersed by water. The seed within the fruit is edible when fully ripe, tasting almost like almond. As the tree gets older, its crown becomes more flattened to form a spreading, vase shape. Its branches are distinctively arranged in tiers. The leaves are large, long and broad, ovoid, glossy dark green, and leathery. They are dry-season deciduous; before falling, they turn pinkish-reddish or yellow-brown, due to pigments such as violaxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. The trees are monoecious, with distinct male and female flowers on the same tree. Both are in diameter, white to greenish, inconspicuous with no petals; they are produced on axillary or terminal spikes. The fruit is a drupe long and broad, green at first, then yellow and finally red when ripe, containing a single seed. Pollens size is ~30 microns. The species' epithet is based on the Malay name Ketapang. Habitat and range The tree has been spread widely by humans, so the native range is uncertain. It has long been naturalised in a broad belt extending from Africa to northern Australia and New Guinea through southeast Asia and Micronesia into the Indian subcontinent. More recently, the plant has been introduced to parts of the Americas. Until the mid-20th century, the tree had been used extensively in Brazilian urban landscaping, since being a rare case tropical deciduous, their fallen leaves would give a \\"European\\" flair to the street. This practice is currently abolished, and the \\"amendoeiras\\" are being replaced by native, evergreen trees. Cultivation and uses T. catappa is widely grown in tropical regions of the world as an ornamental tree, grown for the deep shade its large leaves provide. The fruit is edible, tasting slightly acidic. The wood is red and solid, and has high water resistance; it has been used in Polynesia for making canoes. In Tamil, almond is known as nattuvadumai. The leaves contain several flavonoids (such as kaempferol or quercetin), several tannins (such as punicalin, punicalagin or tercatin), saponines and phytosterols. Due to this chemical richness, the leaves (and the bark) are used in different herbal medicines for various purposes. For instance in Taiwan, fallen leaves are used as an herb to treat liver diseases. In Suriname, an herbal tea made from the leaves has been prescribed against dysentery and diarrhea. The leaves may contain agents for prevention of cancers (although they have no demonstrated anticarcinogenic properties) and antioxidants, as well as anticlastogenic characteristics. Extracts of have shown activity against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine (CQ)-resistant (FcB1) and CQ-sensitive (HB3) strains.Hnawia E, Hassani L, Deharo E, Maurel S, Waikedre J, Cabalion P, Bourdy G, Valentin A, Jullian V, Fogliani B. \\"Antiplasmodial activity of New Caledonia and Vanuatu traditional medicines\\". Pharm Biol. 2011 Apr; 49(4): 369-76. Keeping the leaves in an aquarium may lower the pH and heavy-metal content of the water. It has been used in this way by fish breeders for many years, and is active against some parasites and bacterial pathogens. It is also believed to help prevent fungus forming on the eggs of the fish.
