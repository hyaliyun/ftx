In 1970‚Äì71, the Vancouver Canucks joined the NHL, meaning that there were now three possible venues for an HNIC telecast. Year-by-year breakdown =1970= For six seasons, from through , CBS aired a game each week between mid-January until early-mid May in each of those seasons, mainly on a Sunday afternoon, including playoffs. Each American based franchise was paid US$100,000 annually for the first two years of the initial contract and $150,000 for the third. From 1968‚Äì69 through 1971‚Äì72, the intermission studio was called \\"CBS Control,\\" just like with its NFL coverage. In 1970, Pat Summerall and then Boston Bruins' television announcer Don Earle did a short post-game segment from inside the team's dressing room at the end of CBS' coverage of the fourth (and what turned out to be the final game) of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. WSBK-TV, which was the Bruins' television flagship at the time, simulcast the CBS coverage and did a longer post-game locker-room segment after CBS' coverage ended. After Bobby Orr scored the championship-winning goal after just 40 seconds, so the story went, Summerall turned to Bobby's father, Doug Orr (who was reportedly, too nervous to go back to his seat from the Bruins' dressing room for the start of overtime) and yelled over the crowd in the stands above \\"Mr. Orr, your son has scored, and Boston has won the Stanley Cup!\\" Doug Orr is said to have told Summerall, \\"I know Boston scored, but we didn't see it! What makes you think my son scored?\\" Summerall supposedly replied, \\"Because they wouldn't be yelling this loudly if Esposito had scored!\\" The most commonly seen video clip of Bobby Orr's \\"flight\\" is the American version broadcast on CBS as called by Dan Kelly. This archival clip can be considered a rarity, since about 98% of the time, any surviving kinescopes or videotapes of the actual telecasts of hockey games from this era usually emanate from CBC's coverage. According to Dick Irvin, Jr.'s book My 26 Stanley Cups (Irvin was in the CBC booth with Danny Gallivan during the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals), he was always curious why even the CBC typically uses the CBS replay of the Bobby Orr goal (with Dan Kelly's commentary) instead of Gallivan's call. The explanation that Irvin received was that the CBC's master tape of the game (along with others) was thrown away in order to clear shelf space at the network. The clip exists because WSBK-TV in Boston, then an independent station, was the television flagship of the Boston Bruins. WSBK had a weekly program during the season showing highlights of the previous week's games. WSBK got permission from CBS to simulcast the game and to tape the network's telecast and use highlights from that it for the next week's show. WSBK decided to show the entire (however brief) overtime session in the final 1969-70 edition (aired on May 17, 1970) of Bruins Highlights, as well as in Boston Bruins: World Champions, an hour-long documentary featuring highlights of the team's 1969-70 season and Stanley Cup win. Coincidentally, WSBK is now owned by CBS, run as a sister station to WBZ-TV (formerly owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting as an NBC affiliate). =1971= On January 31, 1971, CBS was scheduled to carry a game between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues, a rematch of the 1970 Finals. The game was to begin at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, but NASA announced that the Apollo 14 lunar-landing mission would be launched that afternoon at 3:23 p.m. Eastern Time. CBS decided to air the first period of the game live, then switch to news coverage once the first period ended (at approximately 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time). At about 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, after the launch coverage was due to end, CBS would show the second and third periods of the game on tape delay. But the launch was delayed for over a half-hour, and after the launch took place, CBS had no time to show the rest of the game on tape. Weekend afternoon playoff games were shown by the network; the same pattern continued through the season. CBS did manage to televise the 1971 Stanley Cup Finals clincher on a Tuesday night and the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals clincher on a Thursday night. In 1971, CBS was not scheduled to broadcast Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, but showed the prime time contest (the first ever occurrence of a NHL game being nationally televised in prime time in the United States) between the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Black Hawks after fans reportedly swamped switchboards at network headquarters in New York City asking that the seventh game be televised. Ironically, the game was not telecast by CBS' Chicago owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV, nor on CBS affiliates in most of Illinois, and parts of Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa, due to Blackhawks' owner Arthur M. Wirtz policy of not telecasting home games. While Dan Kelly once again handled all of the play-by-play work, Jim Gordon replaced Bill Mazer in . For the CBS' Stanley Cup Finals coverage during this period, a third voice was added to the booth (Phil Esposito in 1971 and Harry Howell in 1972). =1972= One trivial note however, on January 23, 1972, Jim Gordon was not in Boston for the Buffalo- Boston game. Therefore, Dick Stockton filled-in and did the game with Dan Kelly. Stockton, although doing some work for The NFL on CBS, was also at the time a sports anchor for WBZ-TV in Boston, which ironically was at the time an NBC affiliate (WBZ-TV switched from NBC to CBS on January 2, 1995, after its parent company Westinghouse invested in and later purchased CBS, making WBZ an owned-and-operated station of the network in September 1995 which it has remained as since). In , Hockey Night in Canada moved all playoff coverage from CBC to CTV to avoid conflict with the lengthy NABET strike against the CBC. Eventually, MacLaren Advertising, in conjunction with Molson Breweries and Imperial Oil/Esso, who actually owned the rights to Hockey Night in Canada (not CBC) decided to give the playoff telecast rights to CTV. Initially, it was on a game by game basis in the quarterfinals (Game 1 of the Boston-Toronto series was seen on CFTO Toronto in full while other CTV affiliates, but not all joined the game in progress. Game 1 of the New York Rangers-Montreal series was seen only on CFCF Montreal while Game 4 not televised due to a lockout of technicians at the Montreal Forum), and then the full semifinals and Stanley Cup Finals. Because CTV did not have 100% penetration in Canada at this time, they asked CBC (who ultimately refused) to allow whatever one of their affiliates were the sole network in that market to show the playoffs. As a result, the 1972 Stanley Cup playoffs were not seen in some of the smaller Canadian markets unless said markets were close enough to the United States border to pick up the signal of a CBS affiliate that carried Games, 1, 4, or 6 (Games 2, 3 and 5 were not nationally broadcast in the United States). During the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals between the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, CBS took a rather calculated risk in not televising the Game 5 match on May 9 (CBS aired regular programming, including the original Hawaii Five-O in that time period on that Tuesday night). This was despite the fact that Game 5 was a potential clincher with the Bruins up three games to one on the Rangers. CBS ultimately lucked out (since the Rangers won Game 5 3-2), and televised the clincher (Game 6) on Thursday night, May 11. After CBS lost the American television rights to NBC following the 1971-72 season (CBS was paying less than $2 million a year and NBC jumped to $5.3 million), the network covered the inaugural season of the World Hockey Association. HBO's first sports broadcast was of a New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks NHL game from Madison Square Garden, transmitted to a Service Electric cable system in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on November 8, 1972; the channel continued to air NHL hockey games through the mid-1970s. More specifically, was transmitted over channel 21‚Äîits original assigned channel on the Teleservice system‚Äîthat evening to 325 Teleservice subscribers in Wilkes-Barre (a plaque commemorating this event is located at Public Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre). =1973 & 1974= From ‚Äì, NBC not only televised the Stanley Cup Finals (including a couple of games in prime time), but also weekly regular season games on Sunday afternoons. The previous contract with CBS was paying the NHL less than $2 million a year and NBC jumped in with an offer of $5.3 million. NBC also aired one regular season and a couple of playoff games in prime time during the first couple of seasons. Tim Ryan and Ted Lindsay (with Brian McFarlane as the intermission host) served as the commentators for NBC's NHL coverage during this period. Since most NHL teams still did not have players' names displayed on the backs of jerseys, NBC persuaded NHL commissioner Clarence Campbell to make teams put on players' names on NBC telecasts beginning with the season to help viewers identify them. Peter Puck was introduced during NBC's NHL coverage in the 1970s. The animated character, whose cartoon adventures (produced by Hanna- Barbera) appeared on both NBC's Hockey Game of the Week and CBC's Hockey Night in Canada, explained hockey rules to the home viewing audience. Besides Peter Puck, the 1970s version of The NHL on NBC had a between-periods feature titled Showdown. The concept of Showdown involved 20 of the NHL's greatest players (16 shooters and four goaltenders) going head-to-head in a taped penalty shot competition. After the NHL left NBC in 1975, Showdown continued to be seen on Hockey Night in Canada and local television broadcasts of U.S.-based NHL teams. =1975= When Game 7 of the 1975 playoff series between Pittsburgh and the New York Islanders took place, Bill Hewitt's Toronto Maple Leafs were already eliminated, the team of Danny Gallivan and Dick Irvin Jr. were prepping for the Montreal-Buffalo series and Brian McFarlane was assisting NBC for their Game 1 coverage of the aforementioned Montreal-Buffalo series the next day (April 26). Starting in the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with Hockey Night in Canada. In these games, Dan Kelly, who was the NHL Network's lead play-by-play announcer, was assigned to do play-by-play along with HNIC color commentators. This for example, happened in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Islanders (April 29), where Kelly teamed up with Brian McFarlane. The entire 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers was simulcast as well. NBC did not broadcast the sixth game of the 1975 Finals, in which the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Buffalo Sabres to clinch their second consecutive championship, played in prime time on a Tuesday night. Had the Finals gone to a seventh game, NBC would have pre- empted its prime time lineup on a Thursday night to carry that deciding contest. But by that time, the network had informed the NHL that unless ratings for the Finals spiked, it would drop the sport, which it did at the end of the season. =1976= After being dropped by NBC after the season, the NHL had no national television contract in the United States. In response to this, the league put together a network of independent stations covering approximately 55% of the country. Games typically aired on Monday nights (beginning at 8 p.m. ET) or Saturday afternoons. The package was offered to local stations with no rights fee. Profits would be derived from the advertising, which was about evenly split between the network and the local station. The Monday night games were often billed as The NHL Game of the Week. Viewers in New York City, Buffalo, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Los Angeles got the Game of the Week on a different channel than their local team's games. Therefore, whenever a team had a ‚Äúhome‚Äù game, the NHL Network aired the home team's broadcast rather than their own. Initially, the Monday night package was marketed to ABC affiliates; the idea being that ABC carried Monday-night NFL football in the fall and (starting in May ) Monday-night Major League Baseball in the spring and summer, stations would want hockey to create a year-round Monday night sports block. But very few ABC stations picked up the package. In most U.S. NHL cities, the Hughes NHL affiliate was the same one that aired the local team's games. About a couple of dozen other stations carried the games. The network had 47 stations for the season. By the time that NBC‚Äôs contract with the NHL ended after the , they were getting a 3.8 rating. Meanwhile, the ratings for the NHL Network in its first month of existence were a 3.1 in New York, 1.9 in Los Angeles, and a 1.3 in Chicago. By , the Monday night games were seen by about 1 million viewers; 300,000 of which were in the Boston area. Also in 1978‚Äì79, the 2 p.m. ET version of the Saturday broadcasts (with the first period cut out) was picked up by all participating affiliates except WSBK-TV Boston (which carried the entire game), and often, the cities whose local teams were playing if the local station aired the NHL Network version of a game instead of a locally produced broadcast. During the season, the NHL Network showed selected games from the NHL Super Series (the big one in that package was Red Army at Philadelphia, but the package didn't include Red Army at Montreal on New Year's Eve 1975, which was seen only on CBC) as well as some playoff games. During the season, the NHL Network showed 12 regular season games on Monday nights plus the All- Star Game. By (the final season of the NHL Network's existence), there would be 18 Monday night games and 12 Saturday afternoon games covered. On January 4, 1976, CBS decided to televise the Soviet Wings/Buffalo Sabres Super Series game nationally. They likely didn't expect anybody to watch as the game went head to head with the AFC Championship Game on NBC. The game also had to be over by 3:30 p.m. EST so that CBS could be ready to broadcast the pregame for the NFC Championship Game. So to save two minutes, they cut \\"O Canada\\" much to the dismay of those attending at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The game did extend past 3:30 p.m. Eastern time, so CBS ended the telecast seconds after the final buzzer went off, allowing the network to air as much of an abbreviated NFL Today pregame show prior to the NFC Championship game as possible. CBC announced prior to the preliminary round of the 1976 playoffs that they would not televise any games from the opening round. As a result of this, the rights were sold back to the individual Canadian teams. Since Montreal received a bye into the quarterfinals, this impacted Toronto and Vancouver's television coverage. While CHCH and CITY both televised all three games of the Toronto-Pittsburgh series (with Bill Hewitt and Brian McFarlane on the call), CHAN picked up the Vancouver-New York Islanders series. Game 1 of the Philadelphia-Toronto series was televised locally to Southern Ontario by CHCH. Game 1 of the Philadelphia-Toronto playoff series was televised locally to Southern Ontario by CHCH. For Game 4 of the 1976 quarterfinal playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Black Hawks (April 16), Marv Albert and Brad Palmer called the game. Albert handled play-by-play for the first and third period while Palmer, the Black Hawks' TV host, handled play-by-play for the second period. They in the process, acted as analysts for each other. Played at Chicago Stadium, the game was blacked out in the Chicago area. Meanwhile, Marv Albert also during the 1976 playoffs, teamed with Tim Ryan (who split play-by-play duties with Albert) and George Michael for Game 1 of the New York Islanders-Buffalo Sabres series (April 11) and Terry Crisp for Game 7 of the Toronto Maple Leafs-Philadelphia Flyers series (April 25). Terry Crisp also worked alongside play-by-play men Gene Hart and Don Earle on Game 4 of the aforementioned Toronto-Philadelphia series (April 17). The 1976 Stanley Cup Finals on the NHL Network marked the first time that the NHL's championship series was nationally televised in its entirety in the United States. Starting in the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with Hockey Night in Canada. In these games, Dan Kelly, who was the NHL Network's lead play-by-play announcer, was assigned to do play-by-play along with HNIC color commentators. This for example, happened in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Islanders (April 29), where Kelly teamed up with Brian McFarlane. The entire 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers was simulcast as well. However, had that final gone to Game 7, then that game would have been broadcast on ABC. The analysts for the 1976 Stanley Cup Finals were active players and each game featured a different analyst alongside Marv Albert. These players were Stan Mikita, Garry Unger, Chico Resch and Curt Bennett. This format continued in 1977 with Stan Mikita, Garry Unger, Chico Resch, Don Awrey replacing Curt Bennett, who instead worked with Marv Albert and Dan Kelly on Game 4 of the Philadelphia Flyers-Boston Bruins playoff series (May 1). =1977= Game 1 of the 1977 Pittsburgh-Toronto playoff series was seen regionally in Southern Ontario on CHCH-Hamilton. =1978= Starting in the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with Hockey Night in Canada. In these games, Dan Kelly, who was the NHL Network's lead play-by-play announcer, was assigned to do play-by-play along with HNIC color commentators. This for example, happened in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Islanders (April 29), where Kelly teamed up with Brian McFarlane. The entire 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers was simulcast as well. =1979= 's Challenge Cup replaced the All-Star Game. It was a best of three series between the NHL All-Stars against the Soviet Union national squad. In the United States, Game 2, which was held on a Saturday afternoon, was shown on CBS as part of CBS Sports Spectacular. The network refused to expand CBS Sports Spectacular to carry the game in full so instead, the show came on during the second intermission, showed taped highlights of the first two periods, and then showed the final period live. The lead-in to Sports Spectacular was The World's Strongest Man. The then-CBS affiliate in Boston, the old WNAC-TV, broadcast a local college hockey game that led into Sports Spectacular. The network, the show and their sponsors had a problem with the rink board advertising that the NHL sold at Madison Square Garden, and refused to allow them to be shown on television. As a result, CBS viewers were unable to see the far boards above the yellow kickplate, and could only see players' skates when the play moved to that side of the ice. Games 1 and 3 were shown on the NHL Network, where the advertising was no problem. In , ABC was contracted to televise Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Since the Finals ended in five games, the contract was void. It was also around this time that ABC offered the NHL a limited deal that NHL president John Ziegler quickly rejected. ABC wanted to split the network and show the NHL in the Northeast and Midwest and NASCAR in the South on Sunday afternoons.

The dress was designed by Norman Hartnell, and would prove the first of many collaborations with members of the British royal family, one of which was the wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth in 1947. The dress was made of satin. The colour of the dress was described by Hartnell as \\"glimmer of pearl\\", whilst others have called it \\"blush pink\\" or simply \\"blush-coloured\\". This choice of colour was unusual for a royal bride; however, due to her age, Alice wished to have a \\"less maiden tone\\". Orange blossoms covered the neckline of the dress, and the veil was constructed from tulle instead of the traditional lace. In terms of jewellery, Alice wore a pearl necklace, pearl stud earrings, and a tiara. Her bouquet was a mixture of roses and lilies.

Biography Maurian was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 21, 1838. He was of French descent. His father, Charles A. de Maurian, was a judge, and his mother was named Lasthenie Peychaud before her marriage. He was a classmate of Morphy at Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, and the two remained close friends thereafter. Maurian never played in any public tournaments in his later chess career, but he did win first prize at the New Orleans Chess Club in 1858. Morphy taught Maurian how to play chess. Morphy originally gave Maurian knight odds in their games, and he continued to do so even after Maurian became too strong of a player for this to be necessary. Morphy and Maurian continued to play chess even after Morphy had otherwise essentially retired from play. Maurian edited a chess column in the New Orleans Delta newspaper from 1858 to 1860, and served as co-editor of the chess column in the New Orleans Times-Democrat for many years, beginning in 1883. When Morphy died in 1884, Maurian was one of the pall bearers at his funeral. Maurian moved to Paris, France in 1890, where he continued to live until his death on December 2, 1912.

The Oilers and Flames were featured frequently as the two teams were contenders the 1980s; in contrast, as the Nordiques were owned by Carling-O'Keefe, a rival to the show's sponsor Molson and whose English- speaking fanbase was very small (being located in a near-exclusively Francophone area of Quebec), the Nords were rarely broadcast, and never from Quebec City during the regular-season. After Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, the network began showing occasional double-headers when Canadian teams visited Los Angeles to showcase the sport's most popular player. These games were often joined in progress, as the regular start time for HNIC was still 8 p.m. Eastern Time and the Kings home games began at 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time (10:30 Eastern). Beginning in the 1995 season, weekly double-headers became the norm, with games starting at 7:30 Eastern and 7:30 Pacific, respectively. In 1998, the start times were moved ahead to 7 p.m. ET and PT. Year-by-year breakdown =1980= In , the National Hockey League replaced their syndicated coverage package The NHL Network with a package on USA. At the time, the USA Network was called UA-Columbia. As the immediate forerunner for the USA Network, UA-Columbia, served as the cable syndicated arm of not only MSG Network in New York, but also PRISM channel in Philadelphia, and whatever pay/cable outlets were around in 1979. USA's coverage began as a Monday night series with Dan Kelly doing play-by-play alongside a variety of commentators including Pete Stemkowski, Lou Nanne and Brian McFarlane. Scott Wahle was the intermission host. ESPN initially covered the NHL during the , and seasons by making deals with individual teams. This included eleven Hartford Whalers home broadcasts in 1980‚Äì81 and 25 the following year. During this time, USA also broadcast National Hockey League games. In order to prevent overexposure, the NHL decided to grant only one network exclusive rights. In April 1982, USA outbid ESPN for the NHL's American national television cable package ($8 million for two years). The independent Hughes Television Network broadcast National Hockey League games aired under the title The NHL '80. Hughes broadcast Thursday night games, the All-Star Game, some playoff games, and Games 1-5 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Hughes technically, used CBC's Hockey Night in Canada feeds for the American coverage of the first five games of the Stanley Cup Finals. The first broadcast involved the Atlanta Flames against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 25. On April 9, 1980, CBC carried the ACTRA awards ceremony. This caused Game 2 of Hartford-Montreal and Edmonton-Philadelphia playoff games not to be televised. Meanwhile, the Toronto-Minnesota game was shifted to CHCH in Hamilton while the Vancouver-Buffalo game was televised by CBC regionally in British Columbia as usual. The ACTRA awards show was tape-delayed into prime time on the west coast. During the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals, Bob Cole, Dan Kelly and Jim Robson shared play-by-play duties for CBC's coverage. Cole did play-by-play for the first half of Games 1, 2 and 5. Meanwhile, Kelly did play-by-play for the second half Games 1-5 (Kelly also did called the overtime period of Game 1). Finally, Robson did play-by-play for first half of Games 3 and 4 and Game 6 entirely. In essence this would mean that Cole or Robson would do play-by-play for the first period and the first half of the second period. Therefore, at the closest stoppage of play near the 10 minute mark of the second period, Cole or Robson would hand off the call to Kelly for the duration of the game. CBS only aired one other NHL game following Game 2 of the 1979 Challenge Cup. That would take place on May 24, 1980, with Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Islanders. CBS was mainly influenced by the United States men's Olympic hockey team's surprise gold medal victory (dubbed \\"The Miracle on Ice\\") in Lake Placid several months prior. CBS agreed to pay $37 million to broadcast the sixth game. In return, the NHL happily moved the starting time from prime time to the afternoon. The Saturday afternoon game was the first full American network telecast of an NHL game since Game 5 of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals aired on NBC. As previously mentioned, when CBS broadcast Game 2 of the 1979 Challenge Cup, it was only seen on CBS for the third period. Game 6 was won in overtime by the host Islanders, which captured the first of their four consecutive Stanley Cups. By this time, Dan Kelly was joined by former NHL on NBC commentator, Tim Ryan. Kelly did play-by-play for the first and third periods as well as overtime. Meanwhile, Tim Ryan did play-by-play only for the second period. Minnesota North Stars general manager Lou Nanne was the color commentator throughout the game. Game 6 pulled a 4.4 rating on CBS. After the game ended, except for its owned-and-operated stations in New York City and Philadelphia, CBS discontinued the telecast and went to a previously-scheduled golf telecast. New York and Philadelphia viewers saw a post-game show before the network joined the very end of the golf broadcast. Given that the game went into overtime, CBS cut away from hockey during the intermission between the end of regulation and the start of overtime to present ten minutes of live golf coverage, with the golf announcers repeatedly mentioning that the network would return to hockey in time for the start of sudden-death. As previously mentioned, Game 6 of the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals turned out to be the last NHL game (to date) to be televised on CBS. It was also the last NHL game on American network television until NBC televised the 1990 All-Star Game. =1981= For the season, some Sunday night games were added. Dan Kelly once again, did most of the play-by-play alongside Mike Eruzione. Dick Carlson and Jiggs McDonald also did play-by-play work on occasion. In addition, Don Cherry was a commentator for at least one game. Meanwhile, Jim West was the host for most games. With USA's coverage of the 1981 Stanley Cup Playoffs, it marked the first time that there was \\"blanket\\" American television coverage of the NHL playoffs. In other words, often, whenever a game was played, it was televised on a national outlet (whether it was broadcast or cable). USA however, didn't televise Game 1 of the playoff series between Philadelphia Flyers and Calgary Flames (April 16) because they were instead broadcasting a baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies. Meanwhile, they also skipped Games 2‚Äì6 (on April 17, 22 and 24) of the Philadelphia‚ÄìCalgary series because of their coverage of the NBA playoffs. USA also didn't televise Games 2 and 5 of the playoff series between the Calgary Flames and Minnesota North Stars (April 30 and May 7 respectively) because of baseball games involving the Minnesota Twins vs. the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. the Philadelphia Phillies respectively. =1982= In the season, Al Trautwig took over as studio host. Dan Kelly did play-by-play with either Gary Green or Rod Gilbert on color commentary. For the playoffs, Dick Carlson and Al Albert were added as play-by-play voices of some games. Meanwhile, Jim Van Horne hosted Stanley Cup Finals games played in Vancouver. In April 1982, USA outbid ESPN for the NHL's American national television cable package with $8 million (at least $2 million more than what ESPN was offering). Aside from the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals, CBC's only other nationally televised postseason games (all of the other games were seen regionally) from that year were the April 23 Boston-Quebec game (Game 6), the April 25 Quebec- Boston game (Game 7), and the May 6 Vancouver-Chicago game (Game 5). =1983= Things pretty much remained the same for USA during the season. Dan Kelly and Gary Green called most games, while Al Albert did play-by-play on several playoff games and hosted one game of the Stanley Cup Finals. USA didn't cover any playoff games on April 7, 1983 because they were broadcasting second round highlights of The Masters. This was followed by a West Coast NBA telecast. =1984= In the season, USA covered over 40 games including the playoffs. While Gary Green did all games, Dan Kelly and Al Albert did roughly 20 games each. Meanwhile, Jiggs McDonald helped broadcast one game. Because USA was airing Masters highlights, Game 1 of the 1984 playoff series between the Minnesota North Stars and St. Louis Blues (April 12) and Game 2 of the playoff series between the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals (April 13) were aired on tape delay at 10 p.m. Eastern Time. =1985= In the and seasons, the NHL returned to CTV, with regular season games on Friday nights (and some Sunday afternoons) as well as partial coverage of the playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals. CTV/Carling O'Keefe initially signed a contract well into the 1984-85 season. As a result, they wanted to cram as many games as possible (beginning in February) in the brief window they had. 1985-86's coverage didn't begin until November, so to avoid conflicts with CTV's coverage of the Major League Baseball postseason and the Canadian Football League. While Molson continued to present Hockey Night in Canada on Saturday nights on the CBC, rival brewery Carling O'Keefe began airing Friday Night Hockey on CTV. This marked the first time in more than a decade that CBC was not the lone over-the-air network broadcaster of the National Hockey League in Canada. The deal with CTV was arranged by the Quebec Nordiques (who were owned by Carling O'Keefe) and all 14 U.S.-based NHL clubs, who sought to break Molson's monopoly on NHL broadcasting in Canada. All of CTV's regular season telecasts originated from Quebec City or the United States, as Molson shut them out of the other six Canadian buildings (as Carling did to them in Quebec City). For USA's final full season of NHL coverage in , Dan Kelly and Gary Green once again, did most games, while Al Albert and Green called the rest. In all, USA covered about 55 games, including 33 in the regular season. Also, Hartford Whalers goaltender Mike Liut was added as a studio analyst for the Stanley Cup Finals. Meanwhile, for increased publicity opportunities, the Stroh Brewing Company turned to such sports as hockey‚Äîwhich had been overlooked by Anheuser and Miller‚Äîand sponsored broadcasts of National Hockey League games on the USA cable network. Seldom during the early rounds of the playoffs did USA carry an away game of one of the three New York-area teams (New York Rangers, New York Islanders, or New Jersey Devils) since WOR-TV New York, at the time available on most of the nation's cable television systems, often carried that away game of the New York-area team both locally in New York and on its \\"superstation\\" feed. One exception was a playoff game between two of the New York-area clubs, since WOR was usually barred from carrying it since the home team's cable- television contract superseded the visiting club's over-the-air television deal. In , Dan Kelly and Ron Reusch called the Philadelphia-Quebec Wales Conference Final series on CTV. They also televised Games 3, 4 and 6 of the Montreal-Quebec Adams Division Final and Games 2 and 5 of the Philadelphia-New York Islanders Patrick Division Final. During Stanley Cup Finals, CBC televised Games 1 and 2 nationally while Games 3, 4 and 5 were televised in Edmonton only. CTV televised Games 3, 4 and 5 nationally while games were blacked out in Edmonton. Dan Kelly, Ron Reusch, and Brad Park called the games on CTV. In , CBC only televised Games 1 and 2 in Montreal and Calgary. CBC would go on to televise Games 3, 4 and 5 nationally. When CTV televised Games 1 and 2, both games were blacked out in Montreal and Calgary. Unlike the year prior, Brad Park was not replaced; only Dan Kelly and Ron Reusch called the games for CTV. After the 1984‚Äì85 season, the NHL Board of Governors chose to have USA and ESPN submit sealed bids. ESPN won by bidding nearly $25 million for three years, about twice as much as USA had been paying. The contract called for ESPN to air up to 33 regular-season games each season as well as the NHL All-Star Game and the Stanley Cup playoffs. On New Year's Eve 1985, CTV broadcast one such game between the Montreal Canadiens and CSKA Moscow in Montreal. Although CTV aired the game (as a \\"Special Presentation of CTV Sports\\"), it was not considered an official part of NHL on CTV package, because the broadcast was presented by Molson instead of Carling O'Keefe. However, the regular NHL on CTV on-air talent were still utilized. =1986= As previously mentioned, the contract called for ESPN to air up to 33 regular season games each season as well as the NHL All-Star game and the Stanley Cup playoffs. The network chose Dan Kelly and Sam Rosen to be the network's first play-by-play announcers, Mickey Redmond and Brad Park were selected to be the analysts, and Tom Mees and Jim Kelly were chosen to serve as studio hosts. ESPN designated Sundays as Hockey Night in America, but also aired select midweek telecasts. ESPN aired its first game, an opening-night matchup between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers, on October 10, 1985. ESPN did not have fixed broadcast teams during the 1985-86 season. Sam Rosen, Ken Wilson, Jim Hughson, Dan Kelly, Mike Lange, Jiggs McDonald, Jim Kelly, and Mike Patrick handled the play-by-play and Mickey Redmond, Bill Clement, John Davidson, Phil Esposito, and Brad Park provided color commentary. The Canadian coverage of the All-Star Game was to be provided by CTV. However, CTV had a prior commitment to carry the third and final episode of Sins, a U.S. miniseries. As a result, TSN took over coverage of the game in Hartford. Dan Kelly, Ron Reusch, and Bobby Taylor called the Calgary-St.Louis Campbell Conference Final series on CTV. CTV's coverage was blacked out in Calgary, where CBC provided coverage. For the Calgary Flames-Winnipeg Jets first-round series in , CBC, who initially had the rights to the series, ultimately passed as they were already maxed out with three other series (Montreal-Boston, Chicago-Toronto, and Edmonton-Vancouver). The rights to the Calgary-Winnipeg series were eventually sold to the CTV affiliates in Calgary (CFCN) and Winnipeg (CKY) as well as Carling O'Keefe. Following the 1985-86 season, CTV decided to pull the plug on the venture. Their limited access to Canadian- based teams (other than Quebec, whose English-speaking fan base was quite small) translated into poor ratings. For the next two years, Carling O'Keefe retained their rights, and syndicated playoff telecasts on a chain of local stations that would one day become the Global Television Network under the names Stanley Cup '87 and Stanley Cup '88, before a merger between the two breweries put an end to the competition. =1987= Despite CTV pulling the plug on their two-year-long venture with the NHL, Carling O'Keefe retained their rights (there were two years remaining on the contract with/without CTV). Things became problematic when the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs opened with Carling O'Keefe still without a network of some sort. The problems arguably peaked when the Montreal-Quebec second-round playoff series opened without Molson being allowed to broadcast from Quebec City, leaving Games 3 and 4 off of English-language television altogether. This led to a hastily-arranged syndicated package on a chain of channels that would one day form the basis of the Global Television Network. The deal between Carling O'Keefe and the Canwest/Global consortium (with a few CBC and CTV affiliates sprinkled in for good measure) came just in time for Game 6 of the Montreal-Quebec series on April 30. It must be stressed that Global, technically, didn't become a national network until 1997. During the 1980s, Global consisted of a single station in Toronto with some rebroadcast transmitters through Ontario, CanWest was a chain of independent channels in Western Canada, and the two often combined to carry syndicated programming, such as this NHL package and the Canadian Football Network, which would also begin in 1987. These NHL broadcasts were aired under the names Stanley Cup '87 and Stanley Cup '88, before a merger between Carling O'Keefe and Molson (the presenters of Hockey Night in Canada on CBC as previously mentioned) put an end to the competition. In 1987, coverage also included all five games of the Campbell Conference Final between the Edmonton Oilers and Detroit Red Wings, and Games 3‚Äì5 of the Finals between the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers. =1988= In 1988, coverage included the Smythe Division Final between the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames (which Global carried nationally, except for the Edmonton and Calgary markets, where the CBC retained exclusive rights), Game 5 of the Norris Division Final between the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues, the Campbell Conference Final between the Oilers and Red Wings, and Games 1 and two of the Finals between the Oilers and Boston Bruins. They also had the rights to Games 6 and 7 of the Finals, which were not necessary. On April 18, 1988 (during Game 1 of the Montreal-Boston playoff series) at approximately 8:08 p.m. local time, there was a power outage in the province of Quebec. While darkness enveloped Montreal and the Forum itself, the Forum's reserve generators kicked into gear. The generators were only able to illuminate the rink surface with enough power to keep the game moving. Ultimately, CBC was left with no choice but to abandon coverage following the 1st period. Chris Cuthbert was assigned by CBC to report and provide updates on Game 1 of Washington-New Jersey playoff series. However, when the Quebec blackout affected CBC's coverage of the Game 1 of the Boston-Montreal playoff series, CBC decided to throw to Cuthbert and the solitary camera beside him in his coverage position to work the remainder of game 1. The whole process was totally done off the cuff. In other words, there were no graphics, no replay capabilities, and no analyst. Unlike the split CTV/CBC coverage of and , the Canwest-Global telecasts were network exclusive, except for Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals if they were necessary. When CBC and Global televised Game 7 of the 1987 Stanley Cup Finals, they used separate production facilities and separate on-air talent. =1989= SportsChannel America was the exclusive American broadcaster of the 1989 All-Star Game. The following year, they covered the first ever NHL Skills Competition and Heroes of Hockey game. SportsChannel America would continue their coverage of these particular events through 1992. In 1991, SportsChannel America replayed the third period of the All-Star Game on the same day that it was played. That was because NBC broke away from the live telecast during the third period in favor of Gulf War coverage. In 1989, SportsChannel America provided the first ever American coverage of the NHL Draft. In September 1989, SportsChannel America covered the Washington Capitals' training camp in Sweden and pre-season tour of the Soviet Union. The Capitals were joined by the Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames, who held training camp in Prague, Czechoslovakia and then ventured to the Soviet Union. Each team played four games against Soviet National League clubs. Games were played in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Riga. The NHL clubs finished with a combined 6‚Äì2 record against the top Soviet teams, including the Red Army club and Dynamo Moscow. Five of the eight contests were televised by SportsChannel America. Unfortunately, SportsChannel America was only available in a few major markets, and reached only a 1/3 of the households that ESPN did at the time. SportsChannel America was seen in fewer than 10 million households. In comparison, by the 1991‚Äì92 season, ESPN was available in 60.5 million homes whereas SportsChannel America was available in only 25 million. As a matter of fact, in the first year of the deal (), SportsChannel America was available in only 7 million homes when compared to ESPN's reach of 50 million. When the SportsChannel deal ended in 1992, the league returned to ESPN for another contract that would pay US$80 million over five years. SportsChannel America took advantage of using their regional sports networks' feed of a game, graphics and all, instead of producing a show from the ground up, most of the time. Distribution of SportsChannel America across the country was limited to cities that had a SportsChannel regional sports network or affiliate. Very few cable systems in non-NHL territories picked it up as a stand-alone service. Regional affiliates of the Prime Network would sometimes pick up SportsChannel broadcasts, but this was often only during the playoffs, and often to justify the cost, some cable providers carrying it during the playoffs only carried it as a pay-per-view option. SportsChannel America also did not broadcast 24 hours a day at first, usually on by 6 p.m., off by 12 Midnight, then a sportsticker for the next 18 hours.

Soveral was canonized in 2017 by Pope Francis along with 29 fellow martyrs. Biography Andr√© de Soveral was born in Captaincy of S√£o Vicente, present S√£o Vicente.http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92442 On August 6, 1593, he joined the Society of Jesus (SJ). After completing his studies at the Jesuit college of the Infant Jesus, he entered the novitiate of the Society at the College of Bahia at the age of 21. In 1606 Soveral was sent among the Indians in the Rio Grande do Norte region, but only a year later he left the Society of Jesus to become a diocesan pastor in Cunha. In 1614 he was already a parish priest in Cunha√∫ (near Natal in the state of Rio Grande do Norte), as a diocesan priest. Cunha√∫ was a village of Canguaretama, in Rio Grande do Norte, which was formed around a sugar cane mill, one of the riches of the region, in addition to the mines for the production of parts, since those on the other side of the ocean took too long and were expensive, with the threat of low profitability and loss of input in time to be processed by the transformation center (a kind of expansion of Paraiba and Pernambuco production to the north, which is the economic cradle of Potiguar). Martyrdom On the morning of 16 July 1645, while celebrating Mass at the Parish of Our Lady of the Candles or Purification, the German Jac√≥ Rabe broke into the church, with the excuse of communicating some provisions by the Supreme Dutch Council of Recife. But after the consecration, the Dutch soldiers, accompanied by the Indians of the tribes of the Tapuias and of the Patiguari, rushed into the church and massacred all the faithful, with the same Father Andr√© de Soveral, who died praying the prayers of the dying their corpses were then looted and only five Portuguese faithful were taken hostage and taken to the Dutch Fort of the Magi. Of the 69 martyrs, only the name of the layman Domingos Carvalho is known. Canonization Andr√© de Soveral and Domingos Carvalho were beatified by John Paul II on March 5, 2000, together with Father Ambr√≥sio Francisco Ferro,http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/93258 layman Mateus Moreira and their fellow Martyrs of Natal.Brazylia: Wspomnienie pierwszych mƒôczennik√≥w na wiara.pl [opublikowano: 2009-10-03] On March 23, 2017, Pope Francis signed a decree recognizing the miracle through the intercession of Andr√© de Soveral and his companions, and on April 20, 2017 during the consistory he set the date of their canonization. On October 15, 2017, in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis held the canonization ceremony of the 30 Protomartyrs of Brazil, whose liturgical feast was celebrated on the 3rd of October. Liturgical memorial of Soveral and his companions from Cunha√∫ are celebrated as a moment of death (July 16) and on the day of the death of Ambr√≥sio Francisco Ferro and comrades from Urua√ßu (October 3), who is in the state of Rio Grande a day off work.

Bennett is a San Francisco Bay Area businessman who co-founded Mollie Stone‚Äôs Markets, a family-owned chain of grocery stores. In 1985 Bennett co- founded the first natural foods supermarket in the Bay Area. After his retirement from the grocery business, Bennett became a community volunteer and musician active in the Bay Area music scene.  Co-founding Mollie Stone‚Äôs Markets  Mollie Stone‚Äôs Markets was co-founded in 1985 by partners David M. Bennett and Mike Stone. Bennett and Stone met while they were both attending California State University, Northridge and decided to go into business together. In the early years, grocer Richard Moresco served as a silent partner. Moresco had extensive experience in the grocery industry and mentored both Bennett and Stone. The company adopted the slogan, ‚ÄúBest of Both Worlds.‚Äù The first Mollie Stone‚Äôs Natural Farm Market was located on Woodside Road in Redwood City. This was the first natural foods supermarket in the Bay Area. Although customers were welcoming to this new business model, the company faced some backlash from other natural foods providers. Bennett reported to the publication, Retail Merchandiser, ‚ÄúA lot of health food companies wouldn‚Äôt sell to us,‚Äù Co-owner David Bennett reveals. ‚ÄúA few of the natural vitamin companies felt like we would destroy their brand‚Äôs reputation because we were moving them out of the local pill shop.‚Äù Natural food supermarket stores in Palo Alto and Sausalito quickly followed the initial Redwood City location. The company expanded significantly in 1996 when well known Bay Area supermarket chain Petrini‚Äôs went out of business. That year, Bennett and his co-founder facilitated the purchase of the Petrini stores in Greenbrae, Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco and the Bayhill Shopping Center in San Bruno Progressive Grocer reported that a Tower Market location in San Francisco was obtained in 2005 In 2011 the company expanded into the Castro region of San Francisco. Bennett celebrated this expansion saying, \\"The Castro Market is in one of the finest and most vibrant neighborhoods in California; we believe it will beautifully blend with our Mollie Stone's culture.‚Äù During the years Bennett co-owned the company, Mollie Stone‚Äôs Markets owned 9 stores, all throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The company was celebrated in the press for many unique and family friendly initiatives such as eliminating tobacco sales and offering free childcare inside their San Mateo and San Bruno stores. Bennett spearheaded many of these innovative business strategies and has been widely recognized in the press for his entrepreneurial skills. While involved with Mollie Stone‚Äôs, Bennett prioritized customer service as he had a passion for catering to the needs of his customers.  Kosher food  After a few years of existence, Mollie Stone‚Äôs became an industry leader in kosher food sales. Bennett responded to a growing customer base looking for a diverse set of kosher food offerings. In 2011 he was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWhat we want to do is have a wide variety on a daily basis‚Ä¶we will start with kosher dairy products, lunchmeats, beef, and expand our groceries as we get feedback from customers.‚Äù  Awards  In 2002 Bennett and his co-founder were awarded the Golden Spire Outstanding Business of the Year award from the Marin County Board of Supervisors. In 2008, Bennett was honored with ‚ÄúWall of Fame‚Äù recognition by the San Mateo Library Foundation for his numerous contributions to the community. The foundation recognized that Mollie Stone‚Äôs was the first market in the San Francisco Bay Area to discontinue the sale of tobacco products as well as the first to provide free childcare for children ages 2‚Äì12 inside the store, known as Mollieland. In 2012, The National Association for the Specialty Food Trade chose Mollie Stone‚Äôs Markets as their outstanding specialty food retailer of the year. The company was one of only five food retailers to be chosen nationwide. That same year Unified Grocers awarded Mollie Stone‚Äôs the Ben Schwartz Retail Grocery Visionary award. In accepting that award Bennett recognized the stellar workforce at Mollie Stone‚Äôs. He was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very fortunate that our employees have been...with us for many years...we have a wonderful core group of employees, which obviously is the success of Mollie Stone‚Äôs markets. We‚Äôve been in business for 26 years, and we have many employees that have been with us over 20 of those years.‚Äù  Community involvement  Bennett is a longtime Rotarian and frequently volunteers with the San Mateo Rotary. After his retirement, he became a frequent mentor to many small business owners in the food and beverage space. In 2019 he volunteered to mentor individuals involved in early stage start-ups such as plug and play. He frequently volunteers as a guest speaker for classes on entrepreneurial ship and what it takes to start a business in the city of San Francisco at local universities such as San Francisco State University and Golden Gate University. He also mentors students at the College of San Mateo to teach them about starting a small business.  Musicianship  Bennett is a frequent supporter and participant in the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. He has played with widely regarded musicians such as Eric Maddox from the Timothy Murphy School. Personal life Bennett was born in Los Angeles, California. He spent his youth in Reseda, California and is a graduate of Chatsworth High School. Bennett honed his salesman skills while growing up in his family‚Äôs construction business.

The film tells the story of the skilled pianist Sylvia Str√∏m (Wenche Foss), who is forced by her husband, the unscrupulous hydropower developer Director Str√∏m (Ola Isene), to sacrifice music for electrification. She falls in love with the dam guard Engineer Borg (Knut Wigert), but then the workers begin to sabotage the construction work so that foreign interests can gain control of the waterfall.

The Malaloa Marina was opened for cruisers‚Äô use and has added a customs wharf to handle inbound and outbound clearances. In 1912, a hospital was constructed on the face of the hill overlooking Pago Pago Bay in Malaloa. It also housed the first nursing school in American Samoa. The health center was later relocated to Utulei until the new LBJ Hospital in Faga'alu was completed on June 6, 1968. The school of nursing in Malaloa became the first high school in American Samoa when established in 1946. The American Samoa Senate approved a bill in August 2018 which allocated $1.5 million for the construction of the Malaloa Dock. A designated park area administrated by the Department of Parks and Recreation is located between Burns Philp and the yacht quay. History Sadie Thompson Inn On September 1, 1912, the first Samoan Hospital was completed at Malaloa. The hospital was constructed on a hillside next to the current location of Sadie Thompson Inn. The hospital included a wooden central administration building which contained an examination room, lavatory, dispensary, and dressing room. Outbuildings were erected for a kitchen, baths, a storeroom, and latrine. A windmill was built near the shore to pump water to a 10,000-gallon tank located 60 feet above the level of the main building. With the completion of the 1912 Malaloa hospital, a major step had been taken to improve overall health on American Samoa. While the U.S. Navy approved the hospital project, it clarified that funds from the U.S. Treasury Department could not be utilized for construction. A Samoan fund was created to finance the cost of construction.Shaffer, Robert J. (2000). American Samoa: 100 Years Under the United States Flag. Island Heritage. Pages 135 and 138. . W. Somerset Maugham resided at the Sadie Thompson Inn in Malaloa during his six- week visit to American Samoa in 1916. The building later became the setting of his short story ‚ÄúRain‚Äù, which was published in 1921. At the time when Maugham visited in 1916, Malaloa had a small dock which was used by lighters to carry goods. Passengers boarded ships on the main wharf. The Sadie Thompson Inn building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003. In 1946, American Samoa's first high school was established at Malaloa, which used to be the site of the first hospital. The school was known as the High School of American Samoa.

The youngest brother of international player Shah Razen Said et al., he scored on his professional league debut in 2019 at the age of 16. Club career A student of Rimba II Secondary School, Hakeme followed his brothers' footsteps (eight of them) in getting into football from the age of 13, turning out for Tabuan A in national youth tournaments. Hakeme's team became youth league champions and cup winners in 2017. They were then invited to participate in the 2017‚Äì18 Brunei FA Cup where they managed to reach the quarterfinals, faring better than their two senior teams. At the start of 2019, Hakeme signed a contract to play for DPMM FC in the 2018-19 Brunei Premier League, returning to the local scene after an absence of 14 years. He scored the professional youth team's first goal in the 30th minute against Rimba Star FC on 8 January in a 4‚Äì0 victory. After 7 games, Hakeme scored nine goals to win the league's golden boot. DPMM also became champions of the league. He also managed to score a hat-trick against Rainbow FC in the qualifying round of the 2018‚Äì19 Brunei FA Cup on 27 January. The head coach of DPMM's first team, Adrian Pennock, kept an eye on Hakeme and promoted him to the first team in the second half of the 2019 Singapore Premier League season, perhaps conveniently after the acquisition of a returning Adi Said from his spell at UiTM FC. An injury to striker Andrey Varankow enabled Pennock to give the youngster his first-team debut against Geylang International on 2 August, withdrawing Adi to the bench after a rusty performance against Home United the week before. At the start of the second half, Hakeme stole the ball deep in the Eagles' back line and broke the deadlock with a debut goal, which at 16 years and 175 days of age was only a day longer than Hariss Harun's youngest goalscorer record for the Singapore leagues. The goal helped DPMM to emerge as 3‚Äì0 victors at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium. International career Hakeme's first international tournament with the Young Wasps was the 2017 AFF U-15 Championship held in Thailand in July 2017. Under Stephen Ng Heng Seng, Brunei U15 managed to finish fourth out of 6 teams, with five points in as many games. Hakeme was ever-present for Brunei at the tournament playing at centre- back. Two months later, the same team set off to Chinese Taipei for the 2018 AFC U-16 Championship qualification Group F matches which were hosted there. Hakeme scored a goal in the first match, a 4‚Äì0 victory against Macau on 16 September. Brunei finished third in the group after another win against Hong Kong in their fourth and last match pushed them to 6 points. A day after scoring in his DPMM FC first-team debut, Hakeme was announced to be joining Brunei U18 for the 2019 AFF U-18 Youth Championship held in Vietnam in August 2019.https://www.instagram.com/p/B0pnKwHFpqD/ He played in four matches without finding the back of the net for the Young Wasps. In November 2019 Hakeme was called up to the national under-23 side competing in the 30th SEA Games held in the Philippines at the end of the month.

Reception  The AllMusic review stated: \\"This 1964 release finds versatile pianist Ray Bryant in a crowd-pleasing frame of mind. The 12 tracks provide solid grooves, lyrical ballads, blues, calypso, a bit of boogie- woogie, and more. Supported by a lively, yet unremarkable, rhythm section, the accessible melodies, riffs, and rhythms stream effortlessly from Bryant's fingers.

They are named after the main series event, the Rolex 24 at Daytona. The class made its racing debut at the 2017 24 Hours of Daytona. The Daytona Prototype International will be replaced by a joint IMSA-ACO class known as Le Mans Daytona h (LMDh) for the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2022. Additionally, the LMDh class will also be able to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2022.  Developmental History  On the 2nd of July 2015, IMSA announced the base regulations for its then un-named new for 2017 Prototype class of the WeatherTech Sportscar Championship, which would succeed and replace the Gen 3 Daytona Prototypes, and Le Mans Prototype LMP2 class cars, which would become obsolete due to new global regulations on the LMP2 category. These base regulations would spell out the restricted areas, where custom manufacturer bodywork was disallowed, and the base prototype's parts would be needed to be used. The main restricted areas would be the rear wing, rear wing mount(s), and engine cover fin, in addition to the bottom the car, the splitter, floor, and diffuser. In addition, a control zone for the splitter was defined, to prevent splitter modifications behind the approximate front axle centerline. Restrictions at the front of the bodywork would also prohibit manufacturers from styling the outer regions of the nose, the area traditionally reserved for dive planes on a prototype. Additional restrictions also bar development in the region directly behind the front tyres of the car, while the diffuser section located aft of the rear tire was also prohibited to be developed. In opened areas for development, the creation of Wing Profiles was also prohibited. Production- based engines would be utilised in the class, with the targeted engine weights and maximum engine displacements being released. Turbocharging would be available for 4 and 6-cylinder engines. Sonic air restrictors would be used for Naturally Aspirated engines, but turbocharged engines would operate without restrictors, with boost levels being RPM-based to balance the acceleration advantages of turbocharged engines compared to Naturally Aspirated engines. On 1 October 2015, IMSA confirmed the release of engine and bodywork guidelines, and announced the name of the then unnamed class - Daytona Prototype International. It was also announced that DPi would be homologated for a minimum of four years, from 2017 through 2020, with the aim of allowing competitors to maximise their investments. To achieve performance parity in the top Prototype class of the championship, IMSA also announced a Balance of Performance (BoP) for both DPi and LMP2 specifications. On 11 January 2016, IMSA Director of Racing Platforms, Mark Raffauf confirmed that each manufacturer would be required to commit to both an engine and bodywork package , and would be locked into an alliance with the selected chassis manufacturer, unlike the previous DP formula, which had allowed bodywork such as the Corvette DP outfitted on multiple chassis, and various chassis options for the same engine. Raffauf also stated that manufacturers would be allowed to make changes to the appearance of the bodywork or even debut new engines and/or branding over that period, subjected to approval and homologation by IMSA. Subsequently, Raffauf also confirmed that factory teams would be allowed, and that manufacturers would not be required to sell any chassis to customers. On January 24 2018, IMSA extended the homologation periods for LMP2, DPi and GTE-spec machinery in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship by an additional year, due to the FIA World Endurance Championship‚Äôs transition to a winter calendar, which would delay the homologation periods in the championship by roughly six months. As such, DPi and LMP2 cars, which had been originally confirmed for a four-year period through 2020, would now be eligible for competition, until at least the end of the 2021 season.  Competition at Le Mans  Initially, it was planned that the DPi cars, outfitted with the standard LMP2 bodywork, would being eligible for Le Mans in LMP2, via ACO‚Äôs Balance of Performance process, to be controlled via the ECU. However, following changes to the regulations by IMSA, which saw the spec Cosworth ECU, as well as other data logging systems removed, the ACO President Pierre Fillon voiced his displeasure on the DPi platform, which eventually led to the cars becoming ineligible in LMP2 at Le Mans. The discussions eventually drifted to placing the cars in the LMP1 Privateer class, but did not bear fruit, with the cars being unable to compete at the race.

The painting depicts the common scene of Manjushri cleaning the elephant. The painting depicts 8 foreign grooms, 2 foreign observers, four monks, and two Chinese attired in loose robes. The heavy labor is left to foreign grooms. It is in the collection of the Indiana University Art Museum. There is little literary evidence for the origins of the elephant tale, but researchers speculate a connection with one of the stories of the Nirvana Sutra. The story is the blind man who feels an elephant ()--the elephant in this tale symbolizes the \\"Buddha nature\\". A group of blind men reach touch a different part of the elephant--one feels the tusk and thinks it is a carrot, another mistakes the elephant's belly for an urn, and so on. The king seeks that Shakyamuni illuminate their limited perception (symbolized by blindness in the parable) that permits only partial truths. The earliest record of this theme in art dates from the 6th century. Tang Dynasty paintings of the same theme have a traditional colour scheme of red and white with some green. A Ming Dynasty painting of the same scene by Chen Hongshou in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has an inscription to support that Ming intellectuals considered this scene to represent \\"sweeping away illusion\\". The silk painting attributed to Li Gonglin was at one time in the collection of Xiang Yuanbian (1525-1590), and this and other works were scattered as a result of subsequent military invasions, with some passing into the hands of other collectors.

These games were often joined in progress, as the regular start time for Hockey Night in Canada was still 8 p.m. Eastern Time and the Kings home games began at 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time (10:30 Eastern). Beginning in the 1995 season, weekly double-headers became the norm, with games starting at 7:30 Eastern and 7:30 Pacific, respectively. In 1998, the start times were moved ahead to 7 p.m. ET and PT. Until the 1990s, there was only one game televised on HNIC each Saturday night in any particular locality and up to 1968, regular season games were still not broadcast in their entirety. In the 1950s, the HNIC telecast followed the lead of the radio broadcast by coming on the air at 9 p.m. ET, with the game typically being joined in progress either just prior to the start of or during the early portion of the second period. Year-by-year breakdown =1990= From 1990 through 1994, NBC only televised the All Star Game. NBC reportedly wanted to test the appeal of hockey, having recently lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS. Shortly thereafter however, NBC gained the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus there was a bit of a notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey. Marv Albert, and John Davidson called the action, while Mike Emrick served as an ice-level reporter in 1990. Meanwhile, Bill Clement served as an ice-level reporter in 1991, 1992 and 1994. Also, Hockey Night in Canadas Ron MacLean helped out with NBC's coverage of the 1993 All-Star Game, as would Jim Gray for the 1994 All-Star Game. The Montreal Canadiens were slated to host the 1990 All-Star Game, but the team withdrew their bid to considerations due to the superb hosting by Quebec City of Rendez-vous '87. This had allowed the Pittsburgh Penguins, which wanted to host an All-Star Game in 1993, to move up three years early. For its part, Pittsburgh's organizers added much more to previous games, creating the first \\"true\\" All-Star weekend. Firstly was the addition of the Heroes of Hockey game, a two-period oldtimers' game between past NHL greats. The second was the addition of the National Hockey League All-Star Skills Competition, a competition between the players invited to the All-Star Game. The Skills competition was created by Paul Palmer, who adapted the Showdown feature seen on Hockey Night in Canada from to . All-Star players would be rewarded with US$2,500 for any win in the skills competition. To accommodate the altered activities, the game itself was played on a Sunday afternoon instead of a Tuesday night, as was the case in previous years. This allowed NBC to air the game live across the United States ‚Äì marking (surprisingly) the first time that a national audience would see Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux play. Referees and other officials were also wired with microphones in this game, as were the two head coaches. Finally, NBC was also allowed to conduct interviews with players during stoppages in play, to the chagrin of the Hockey Night in Canada crew, whose attempts to do likewise were repeatedly denied by the league in previous years. =1991= In 1991, NBC broke away from the telecast in the third period to televise a briefing from The Pentagon involving the Gulf War. SportsChannel America included the missing coverage in a replay of NBC's telecast (NBC owned 50% of Rainbow Enterprises, the parent of SportsChannel America). =1992= Unfortunately, SportsChannel America was only available in a few major markets, and reached only a 1/3 of the households that ESPN did at the time. SportsChannel America was seen in fewer than 10 million households. In comparison, by the 1991‚Äì92 season, ESPN was available in 60.5 million homes whereas SportsChannel America was available in only 25 million. As a matter of fact, in the first year of the deal (), SportsChannel America was available in only 7 million homes when compared to ESPN's reach of 50 million. When the SportsChannel deal ended in 1992, the league returned to ESPN for another contract that would pay US$80 million over five years. Shortly after the ESPN deal was signed, SportsChannel America would contend that its contract with the NHL gave them the right to match third-party offers for television rights for the 1992‚Äì93 season. SportsChannel America accused the NHL of violating a nonbinding clause. SportsChannel America argued that it had been deprived of its contractual right of first refusal for the 1992‚Äì93 season. Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court justice Shirley Fingerwood would deny SportsChannel America's request for an injunction against the NHL. Upholding that opinion, the appellate court found the agreement on which SportsChannel based its argument to be \\"too imprecise and ambiguous\\" and ruled that SportsChannel failed to show irreparable harm. =1993= From its debut in 1992 until the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season, weekly regular-season games were broadcast on Sundays (between NFL and baseball seasons), Wednesdays, and Fridays, and were titled Sunday/Wednesday/Friday Night Hockey. Prior to 1999, these telecasts were non- exclusive, meaning they were blacked out in the regions of the competing teams, and an alternate game was shown in these affected areas. Beginning in 1999‚Äì2000 season, ESPN was permitted two exclusive telecasts per team per season. When ESPN started broadcasting NBA games on Wednesday and Friday nights in 2002, the weekly hockey broadcasts were moved to Thursday, and the broadcasts renamed to Thursday Night Hockey. There were reports about NBC making an arrangement to air four to eight regular season games for the season but nothing materialized. NHL officials had arranged a four- to eight-game, time-buy package on NBC, but that fell through when the NHL wanted assurance that all NBC affiliates would carry the games (since 2006, NBC has generally gotten all but a couple of affiliates in the Top-50 markets to carry the games). For instance, in 1990, NBC's affiliates in Atlanta (NBC's coverage of the 1992 All-Star Game aired on the independent station WTLK in that market), Charlotte, Memphis, New Orleans, Indianapolis and Phoenix did not clear the game (Atlanta and Phoenix would eventually receive NHL teams, however the Atlanta franchise relocated to Winnipeg in 2011). Ultimately, roughly 15% of the nation did not have access to the game. In the and seasons, ABC televised six weekly regional telecasts on Sunday afternoons beginning in March (or the last three Sundays of the regular season). This marked the first time that regular season National Hockey League games were broadcast on American network television since (when NBC was the NHL's American broadcast television partner). ABC would then televise three weeks worth of playoff games (or the first three Sundays of the playoffs). The network did not televise the Stanley Cup Finals, which instead, were televised nationally by ESPN and by Prime Ticket in Los Angeles () and MSG Network in New York (). Games televised on ABC were not subject to blackout. These broadcasts (just as was the case with the 1999‚Äì2004 package) were essentially, time-buys by ESPN. In other words, ABC would sell three-hour blocks of airtime to ESPN, which in return, would produce, supply broadcasters and sell advertising. Also as evidence by ABC's Raycom produced college basketball package around the same time period, this arrangement could also be interpreted as a way to avoid union contracts, which require that 100% of network shows had to use crew staff who were network union members. The main difference is that the graphics used for the telecasts were those used by ABC Sports, instead of the ones seen on ESPN National Hockey Night. In later years, the roles would be reversed as ESPN's graphical style would be used on the broadcasts with the exception of intermission reports. ABC even used ESPN's theme music for the 1992‚Äì1994 coverage. During ABC's next stint with the NHL, the network used its own theme music. Overall, ABC averaged a 1.7 rating for those two seasons. =1994= Beginning in 1993-94, up to five games per week were also shown on ESPN2 (dubbed \\"Fire on Ice\\"). During the Stanley Cup playoffs, ESPN and ESPN2 provided almost nightly coverage, often carrying games on both channels concurrently. Games in the first two rounds were non-exclusive, while telecasts in the Conference Finals and Finals were exclusive (except in 1993 and 1994). When the NHL television contract went up for negotiation in early 1994, Fox (which was in the process of launching its sports division after acquiring the rights to the National Football Conference of the NFL) and CBS (which was hoping to land a major sports contract to replace the NFL rights that they lost to Fox and Major League Baseball rights that they lost to ABC and NBC) competed heavily for the package. On September 9, 1994, the National Hockey League reached a five-year, US$155 million contract with Fox for the broadcast television rights to the league's games, beginning with the 1994‚Äì95 season, effectively ending ABC's time-buy deal with ESPN after just two seasons. On the heels of its surprise acquisition of the television rights to the National Football League in December 1993, Fox sought deals with other major sports leagues to expand its newly created sports division, opting to go after the rights to broadcast National Hockey League (NHL) games. CBS, which had just lost its NFL package (which primarily included the rights to regular season and playoff games from the National Football Conference) to Fox, was the network's primary competitor for the NHL package, hoping to replace some of the sports programming it had lost to the upstart network. Nevertheless, in a serious blow to the elder network, Fox outbid CBS for the NHL package as well. On September 9, 1994, the National Hockey League reached a five-year contract with Fox for the broadcast television rights to the league's games, beginning with the 1994‚Äì95 season. The network paid $155,000,000 ($31,000,000 annually) to televise NHL regular season and postseason games, considerably less than the $1,580,000,000 Fox paid for the NFL television rights. The NHL's initial deal with Fox was significant, as a U.S. network television contract was long thought unattainable for the league during the presidency of John Ziegler. For 17 years after the 1975 Finals were broadcast on NBC, there would be no national over-the-air network coverage of the NHL in the United States (except for the 1979 Challenge Cup and Game 6 of the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals on CBS, and NBC's coverage of the NHL All-Star Game from 1990 to 1994) and only spotty coverage on regional networks. This was due to the fact that no network was willing to commit to carrying a large number of games, in turn providing low ratings for NHL telecasts. ABC would eventually resume the network broadcasting of regular NHL games (on a time buy basis through ESPN) for the 1992‚Äì93 season. This continued through the 1993‚Äì94 season, before Fox took over for the next five seasons. =1995= Fox inaugurated its NHL coverage on April 2, 1995, towards the end of the 1994‚Äì95 regular season, with six games (between the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers; St. Louis Blues and Detroit Red Wings; Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals; Chicago Blackhawks and Dallas Stars; Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning; and the San Jose Sharks and Anaheim Ducks). Mike Emrick and John Davidson were the lead broadcast team. Joe Micheletti served as the reporter for national game broadcasts on Fox, while regionally- distributed games were handled by a variety of announcers, in addition to Emrick and Davidson. For the first four years of the deal, James Brown hosted the show and Dave Maloney was the studio analyst from the Fox Network Center studios in Los Angeles. For the fifth and final season, Suzy Kolber served as the studio host and Terry Crisp served as the studio analyst. Occasionally, active NHL players such as Mike Modano would serve as guest analysts. Fox split coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals with ESPN. Game 1 of the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals was the first Finals game shown on network television since 1980 and the first in prime time since 1973. Games 1, 5, and 7 were usually scheduled to be televised by Fox; and Games 2, 3, 4, and 6 were set to air on ESPN. However, from 1995 to 1998, the Finals matches were all four game sweeps; the 1999 Finals ended in six games. The consequence was that ‚Äì except for 1995, when Fox did televise Game 4 ‚Äì the decisive Game 7 was never shown on network television. Perhaps in recognition of this, Games 3 through 7 were always televised by ABC in the succeeding broadcast agreement between the NHL and ABC Sports/ESPN. Game 4 of the 1995 Final was notable because not only did the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup, but also the team's main television play-by-play announcer, Mike Emrick, announced it. KTVU, the Fox affiliate in the San Francisco Bay Area, dropped Game 4 of the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals (June 24) for a San Francisco Giants game. The game between the Giants and Florida Marlins in Miami had a long rain-delay. This allowed for KTVU to broadcast the hockey game after-all. However, the baseball game finally started before the hockey game ended. KTVU got a lot of complaints, so they re-aired the end of the hockey game the following Saturday. =1997= Ron MacLean did not host CBC's coverage of Games 2 and 3 of the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals as he was attending the funeral of co-presenter Don Cherry's wife, Rose. Scott Russell sat in for him. =1998= TSN owned the national cable rights to the NHL in Canada from 1987 through 1998, after which what was then called CTV Sportsnet purchased the national cable rights to NHL games. Prior to this, TSN's NHL coverage was sparse as they only acquired games a la carte. From 1987-88 to 1997-98, they usually showed games twice per week through the regular season and in the first round of the playoffs they provided extensive coverage of series not involving Canadian-based teams. TSN was the first ever holder of cable rights to the NHL in Canada, although the task of acquiring these rights were complicated by contradicting statements by CBC that it did own the cable rights to the NHL, along with the involvement of competing beer company Molson in Canadian NHL rights at the time (TSN was founded by its competitor, Labatt). With the help of a Molson employee who was a friend of TSN's founder Gordon Craig, a deal was reached between TSN, Molson, and the NHL. In August 1998, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 signed a five-year television deal with the NHL, worth a total of approximately US$600 million (or $120 million per year). The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in the 1991‚Äì92 season. As previously mentioned, as was the case with the 1992-1994 deal, ABC's subsequent NHL coverage was in reality, made up of time‚Äìbuys from ESPN. This was noted in copyright beds at the conclusion of the telecasts, i.e. \\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\\" ESPN then signed a similar television rights contract in 2002 so it could produce and broadcast National Basketball Association games on ABC. ABC also televised the National Hockey League All-Star Game and Games 3‚Äì7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time. In the league's previous broadcast television deal with Fox, the network split coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals with ESPN. Games 1, 5 and 7 were usually scheduled to be televised by Fox; Games 2, 3, 4 and 6 by ESPN. However, from 1995 to 1998, the Finals were all four-game sweeps; 1999 ended in six games. The consequence was that ‚Äì except for 1995, when Fox did televise Game 4 ‚Äì the decisive game was never on network television. From 1998‚Äì99 until 2001‚Äì02, Sportsnet aired Labatt Blue Tuesday Night Hockey weekly during the regular season, and covered first-round playoff series that did not feature Canadian teams. The network's first live event was an opening night match between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers. Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson served as the lead broadcast team. Kevin Quinn and Ryan Walter served as the secondary team. Darren Dreger as the studio host and Greg Millen (1998-1999), joined by other personalities such as Nick Kypreos (1998-2002), and Mike Keenan (1999-2000). =1999= Things ended badly between Fox and the league in 1999, when the NHL announced a new television deal with ESPN that also called for sister broadcast network ABC to become the new network television partner (as previously mentioned). Fox challenged that it had not been given a chance to match the network component of the deal, but ABC ultimately prevailed. TSN began airing Toronto Maple Leafs games regionally, presented by Molson as Molson Canadian Leafs Hockey, in the 1998-99 season, when they first lost the national contract. The package was originally for 30 games, but reduced to 17 once TSN re-acquired the national rights in 2002. Ten of those games were ones that TSN acquired from the NHL to air nationally. The other seven, TSN acquired from the Maple Leafs as regional games. However, TSN eventually came to an agreement with the other five Canadian clubs to air these games nationally. Play by play of the regional Leafs games was originally handled by Joe Bowen and Harry Neale, with Glenn Healy serving as \\"Inside the Glass\\" reporter. The deal expired at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season and from the 2007-08 season through 2013-14, every Maple Leafs game on TSN was broadcast as a national NHL on TSN game.

Time of the church construction is still arguable and varies between the 5th, 6th, 11-12th or 13th centuries.  Description  The eastern facade of the church with three convex apsids Following a tradition in Georgian architecture of harmonious relationship of temples with the surrounding natural landscape, Metekhi Church was built to look like a growing continuation of the cliff, visible from many city points. The cross-in-square church occupies an area of 20 √ó 16 meters and is somewhat prolonged vertically. Eastern facade has three convex apsids, with central apsid the largest. Nothing similar is known among the churches of 11-13th centuries, which makes it rather archaic. The dome with tholobate is internally held by four pillars, which is also a more archaic feature (two pillars after 11th century), as well as semicircular projections on pillars. They were renovated in 16-17th centuries. Pointed arches under the dome are also the signs of 16-17th century rebuildings. The tholobate is wall destroyed by lightning in 17th century and restored in 18th. The church has a portal on the northern side, with stairs and entrance from the east. Presumably, the portal also had a western entrance, which is no longer in existence. Position of the portal in the central part of the wall, rather than in the western, is also not typical for the 11th-12th century architecture. . Carvings on the portal arch of the church The walls are made of hewn quadras, not preserved on the southern facade, where they were substituted by bricks in 18th century. Original walls remain on the east and north sides, lower part of the west and eastern part of south side. The entrance on the southern wall was also created in 18th century. Exterior decorations of the church, traditional Georgian rock carvings, are characteristic for the Georgian Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries. The most well-preserved eastern facade with three apsids, and northern facade with the portal contain decorative rock engravings. Rhombic rosettes and convex architraves are the motives commonly used in church decorations of that period. However, also characteristic architecture is missing except for portal passages. Architrave of the central apsid has ornamented cross. Decorations are generally disconnected, rather schematic and miniaturised, which are the characteristics of 13th century style. Interior murals were not preserved. Among various icons one, called \\"100000 martyrs\\", tells about a tragic event that took place in Tbilisi in 1226. The town was taken over by troops of Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din. He ordered that icons from Sioni church were dropped on Metekhi Bridge, and Tbilisi citizens to step on them or beheaded. Church tradition tells about 100,000 inhabitants, who disobeyed and were executed. Their heads were floating downstream of Mtkvari River.  History  Oral tradition attributes construction of the church to the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali in the 5th century, who erected it as his court church, or to his son Dachi in the 6th century, although neither archeological nor written evidence exist about this. Same tradition places the tomb of St. Shushanik into the church sacristy. But no studies confirmed that yet. Some 19th century authors even mention exact year, 455, when the church was founded by Vakhtang I. The name \\"Metekhi\\" was first time mentioned in the Georgian medieval chronicles Kartlis Tskhovreba in connection with suppression of the rebellion against King Demetre I in 1132 (or 1145), and execution of eristavi Ivane Abuletisdze, who was buried in \\"Metekhi\\". It is though unclear, which particular church is mentioned. Except for Tbilisi, a church of Assumption is also found in a small village named Metekhi. The second mention is concerned with The Battle of Shamkor in 1195 (or 1200), when King Tamar, after sending troops, \\"...took off her shoes and arrived barefeet to the Church of Assumption in Metekhi\\". By the fact that royal palace was in Tbilisi, it is often supposed that Metekhi Church was already there in the end of 12th century. Meanwhile, other facts from Kartlis Tskhovreba further confuse the situation. The troops before leaving for the battle were gathered in \\"Somkhiti\\", that is Lower Kartli region, and Tamar was present there. After sending the troops she walked to the church back in Tbilisi, which would be impossible to do barefeet. Further, it is said that she \\"went to the Church of Assumption in Vardzia and prayed before the Virgin Mary of Vardzia... and sent troops from Vardzia, standing there herself barefeet...\\". If Metekhi Church was there, it was destroyed in 1235 during the invasion of the Mongols, and rebuilt some time between 1278 and 1289, under the reign of Demetrius II. The third mention in The Georgian Chronicles tells that \\"The king... built a monastery in Isani Palace for the Virgin Mary of Metekhi.\\" Isani was the original name of a neighbourhood on left bank of Mtkvari River on high cliff that hosted royal palace, and thus this is the earliest clear mention of presence of monastery in Tbilisi on Metekhi Cliff. At least until the end of 14th century the area surrounding the monastery was still covered by forests, which is concluded from 1398 charter of Metekhi church: \\"... A monastery of the Virgin Mary Metekhi in Avlabar, with its manor and Avlabar forests belonging to it.\\" During the reign of Vakhtang V, in 1658, the church became a storage for gunpowder. The monastery was abandoned in the same century. Its first depiction also comes from the same time by French traveller Jean Chardin (1671). King Erekle II. The fortress together with the church were retaken from Turks by Erekle II in 1748. Carving on southern facade tells about this event: \\"The King Erekle II forcely took this fortress from enemy, lead by the Christ's Cross like a shield. Having the church freed, he turned it into his court church. Such are the deeds of Christ loving king. In glory of the God and to the King Erekle.\\" After Georgia was included into the Russian Empire, the fortress became a prison, and prisoners scratched their names on the church facade. In the beginning of Soviet era, in 1921, NKVD camp was on the place. Executions of prisoners were regularly committed here. Fortifications were destroyed in 1937, and the church was also planned to be demolished, but managed to survive due to local protest. In 1940-60s, the church functioned as a depository for collections of the National Museum of Art, and entire eastern part of the interior was separated by thick wall. In 1974, the wall was demolished and the church was made a youth theater. It had a backstage in southern part of interior, a stage under the dome, surrounded by amphitheater with 100 seats. Finally, the church was returned to worship in 1988. First comprehensive measurements and quality drawings and photographs of the church were made by a group of scientists, lead by Vakhtang Beridze in 1942 and subsequent years. The results, including description of church history and analysis, were compiled in a monograph by Beridze et al. (1969).

It is based on Pedro Lemebel's homonymous novel. Production For many years, the idea of adapting to the cinema the only novel by the iconic Chilean artist Pedro Lemebel was being handled. Director Rodrigo Sep√∫lveda and Lemebel himself were strongly involved. There were many reasons that postponed the project, lack of funding, disagreements between parts, copyrights for the cinematographic work, the authorship of the script, etc. There was much speculation about the problems among everyone involved in something that the producer once called his \\"most ambitious project to date.\\" Complications reached a very high point after Lemebel's death in 2015. Finally in 2019 it was announced that after signing a pre-agreement, the filming would begin with director Rodrigo Sep√∫lveda and a cast headed by the renowned Chilean actor Alfredo Castro (according to Lemebel's own wishes). At the same time it was reported that two famous musicians and songwriters from Argentina and Chile would take care of the music, the incidental music would be in charge of Pedro Aznar and the arrangement and selection of songs (a fundamental part of the entire work) would be handled by Manuel Garc√≠a. Subsequently, Mexican actor Leonardo Ortizgris (Museum ) and Argentina's Julieta Zylberberg (Wild Tales) joined the cast, which is completed by Chilean actors Sergio Hern√°ndez (Gloria), Luis Gnecco (Neruda) and Amparo Noguera (Tony Manero).

A regular feature was publication of letters received by people in Britain from friends and relations who had settled in South Australia. The Record ran from 1837 to 1841 under several title changes. Capper published two books addressed to prospective migrants to South Australia, both of which went through several editions. The South Australian Record The Record was at first published monthly A nice potted history of the early colony. (price 5d.) by Capper and John Gliddon from an office at 37 Great Marlborough street, Westminster, from 8 November 1837. A paragraph in the Record of (perhaps) 8 May 1839 contained a candid appraisal of one of the South Australian Company's representatives in the colony, which drew the ire of Robert Torrens, who recommended to the Governor that he publicly disown the statement as an \\"error\\" on Capper's part. Rather than submit to this insult, Capper resigned from his position with the Colonization Office, but continued publishing the Record. The South Australian Record became briefly South Australian Record and Australasian Chronicle in 1840, became the South Australian Record and Australasian and South African Chronicle then in March 1841 the Australasian Record which ran to either late 1843 or early 1844. South Australia books Capper assembled two compendia of advice and useful information for intending emigrants, aimed at two distinct classes of prospective emigrants. *South Australia First edition November 1837 but greatly expanded in second edition May 1838, entitled South Australia: Containing Hints to Emigrants, Proceedings of the South Australian Company, a Variety of Useful and Authentic Information, a Map of the Eastern Coast of Gulf St. Vincent and a Plan of Adelaide This book, which went to at least four editions, is available as a recent (2018) imprint of Sagwan Press. *How to Get to South Australia, being information for Labouring Emigrants respecting the above Colony. First published in October 1839, this publication went through at least four editions, the third being freely available to read here.

In 1845 the firm of Capper and Gole was declared bankrupt. There is no reason to believe Capper ever visited Australasia. Not to be confused with . . .

The broadcast includes hockey-related features all afternoon, leading up to a tripleheader of NHL action featuring the seven Canadian teams (Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, Winnipeg Jets). One exception was the 2008 edition that featured four games including two American teams (Detroit and Colorado) along with the six Canadian teams; this was due to the NHL's schedule format at the time, as there was no inter-conference games between Canadian teams. Lead commentators, Don Cherry and Ron MacLean broadcast from a remote area. The broadcast includes live broadcast segments from smaller communities right across the country and features panel discussions on issues facing \\"Canada's game\\" at both the minor and pro levels. The day is usually in mid-February, but was broadcast in early January in 2002 and 2006 due to the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2006 Winter Olympics, respectively; the 2007 event was also held in January (January 13), though no sporting events key to Canada were scheduled. For years, all playoff games involving Canadian teams were aired by the CBC, though not always on a national basis. From 2008 through 2014, rights to individual series were instead picked using a draft-like setup; in the first round, CBC first, second, fourth, and sixth selections among opening round series, and TSN had the third, fifth, seventh, and eighth selections. CBC tended to select series involving at least one Canadian team and series involving teams with strong Canadian fanbases (such as Boston, Buffalo, Detroit, and Pittsburgh); as a result of this arrangement, if more than two Canadian teams qualified for the playoffs, it was likely that at least one series involving a Canadian team would be broadcast by TSN. Year-by-year breakdown =2000= In August 1998, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 signed a five-year television deal with the NHL, worth a total of approximately US$600 million (or $120 million per year). The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in the 1991‚Äì92 season. As previously mentioned, as was the case with the 1992-1994 deal, ABC's subsequent NHL coverage was in reality, made up of time‚Äìbuys from ESPN. This was noted in copyright beds at the conclusion of the telecasts, i.e. \\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\\" ESPN then signed a similar television rights contract in 2002 so it could produce and broadcast National Basketball Association games on ABC. Beginning in 1999‚Äì2000 season, ESPN was permitted two exclusive telecasts per team per season. When ESPN started broadcasting NBA games on Wednesday and Friday nights in 2002, the weekly hockey broadcasts were moved to Thursday and the broadcasts renamed to Thursday Night Hockey. ABC also televised the National Hockey League All-Star Game and Games 3‚Äì7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time. In the league's previous broadcast television deal with Fox, the network split coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals with ESPN. Games 1, 5 and 7 were usually scheduled to be televised by Fox; Games 2, 3, 4 and 6 by ESPN. However, from 1995 to 1998, the Finals were all four-game sweeps; 1999 ended in six games. The consequence was that ‚Äì except for 1995, when Fox did televise Game 4 ‚Äì the decisive game was never on network television. =2002= From its debut in 1992 until the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season, weekly regular-season games were broadcast on Sundays (between NFL and baseball seasons), Wednesdays, and Fridays, and were titled Sunday/Wednesday/Friday Night Hockey. Prior to 1999, these telecasts were non- exclusive, meaning they were blacked out in the regions of the competing teams, and an alternate game was shown in these affected areas. From 1998‚Äì99 until 2001‚Äì02, Sportsnet aired Labatt Blue Tuesday Night Hockey weekly during the regular season, and covered first-round playoff series that did not feature Canadian teams. The network's first live event was an opening night match between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers. Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson served as the lead broadcast team. Kevin Quinn and Ryan Walter served as the secondary team. Darren Dreger as the studio host and Greg Millen (1998-1999), joined by other personalities such as Nick Kypreos (1998-2002), and Mike Keenan (1999-2000). HDnet's coverage began in the 2001‚Äì02 season with a 65 game schedule.\\"NHL in HD\\" Coverage Begins on HDNet Oct. 4 HDNet produced broadcasts in conjunction with several Fox Sports Net regional outlets, sharing audio and graphics with FSN's standard definition production units. NHL on HDNet prototypically, aired on Tuesday and Friday nights during its early years. =2003= TSN's most recent period as national rightsholder lasted from 2002 to 2014. During this period, TSN usually televised three or four games per week during the regular season, with its flagship broadcast, Wednesday Night Hockey, airing on Wednesdays. During the playoffs, TSN had third, fifth, seventh, and eighth choices of first-round series, second and fourth in the second round, and second in the Conference Finals. These changes allowed TSN to broadcast playoff games involving Canadian teams,TSN signs new broadcast deal with NHL such as at the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs, as TSN televised the Calgary Flames' first-round series against the Chicago Blackhawks, the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs when the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Washington Capitals in seven games, and the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs when the Vancouver Canucks lost in four straight games to the San Jose Sharks. TSN began airing Toronto Maple Leafs games regionally, presented by Molson as Molson Canadian Leafs Hockey, in the 1998-99 season, when they first lost the national contract. The package was originally for 30 games, but reduced to 17 once TSN re-acquired the national rights in 2002. Ten of those games were ones that TSN acquired from the NHL to air nationally. The other seven, TSN acquired from the Maple Leafs as regional games. However, TSN eventually came to an agreement with the other five Canadian clubs to air these games nationally. Play by play of the regional Leafs games was originally handled by Joe Bowen and Harry Neale, with Glenn Healy serving as \\"Inside the Glass\\" reporter. When TSN re-acquired the national cable rights to the NHL in 2002, Pierre McGuire was hired as its lead hockey analyst. After the 2011 NHL Draft, it was announced McGuire had taken a full-time position as a reporter for NBC Sports, effective as of the 2011-12 season. Pierre still makes occasional appearances as an analyst during TSN's hockey coverage and on TSN Radio. In 2003, the Montreal Canadiens announced a deal to license its French-language broadcast rights for all of its preseason, season, and playoff games to RDS. This was controversial as it threatened the longest-running television show in Quebec, Radio-Canada's La Soir√©e du hockey. Days later, an agreement was reached whereby RDS and Radio-Canada would simultaneously broadcast Canadiens games on Saturday nights, saving the show. Within the province of Quebec, this arrangement stopped after the 2003‚Äì04 NHL season, and French-language Canadiens broadcasts now air only on RDS. Simulcasted coverage continued in regions that do not receive RDS on analog TV (all of Canada south/west of the Ottawa Region) on Radio-Canada until the 2006‚Äì07 NHL season. In addition to Canadiens games, RDS also televised a smaller package of Ottawa Senators games, which appear on either RDS or RDS Info as well as other games. RDS also had the French-language rights to the Stanley Cup playoffs and Finals through 2014, regardless of which teams participated. The NHL game broadcasts formerly varied in name depending of the day of the week. Saturday games were known as Le Hockey du Samedi Soir Coors Light (Coors Light Saturday Night Hockey). Tuesday games were known as Les M√©chants Mardis Molson-Ex while all of the other day or night games were known as Le Hockey Subway des Canadiens (Subway Canadiens Hockey). NHL telecasts not involving the Canadiens were simply titled Le hockey Bud Light de la LNH (Bud Light NHL Hockey). Since 2014, games have been known as Le hockey des Canadiens (Bell/Coca-Cola/McDonald's). (Bell/Coca-Cola/McDonald's Canadiens Hockey). The sponsor affiliations change from time to time. 2003 was the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals that involved teams from one city in the same year, as both the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the San Antonio Spurs and the Nets in New Jersey on June 8, Brad Nessler, Tom Tolbert and Bill Walton said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night, also at Continental Airlines Arena. Gary Thorne, Bill Clement and John Davidson mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler, Tolbert and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. =2004= In May 2004, NBC reached an agreement with the NHL to broadcast a slate of regular season games and the Stanley Cup Finals. The plan called for NBC to air at least six weeks of regular season games (three regional games each week) on Saturday afternoons. In addition, NBC was to show one or two playoff games per weekend during the playoffs. Between two and five games from the Stanley Cup Finals would air in prime time (OLN/Versus received the other two as part of its package). NBC's primary game each week, as well as the Stanley Cup Finals, would air in high definition. Unlike previous network television deals with the NHL (like Fox, which had the rights from 1994 to 1999 and ABC, which had the rights from 1999 to 2004), NBC paid no upfront rights fee, instead splitting advertising revenue with the league after meeting its own production and distribution costs. On the other hand, the league avoided the arrangement some minor sports leagues have, in which they pay networks for broadcast time and produce their own telecasts, but keep any advertising revenue. The last time NBC Sports entered a television deal which did not require it to pay any rights fees was in 1994‚Äì1995, when the division was involved in the Major League Baseball joint venture called \\"The Baseball Network.\\" To a lesser extent, NBC also had a similar sort of revenue-sharing agreement with the Arena Football League and, because of their ownership in the XFL, also paid no rights fees for airing that league. Following the 2003‚Äì04 season, ESPN was only willing to renew its contract for two additional years at $60 million per year. ABC refused to televise the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time, suggesting that the Finals games it would telecast be played on weekend afternoons (including a potential Game 7). Disney executives later conceded that they overpaid for the 1999‚Äì2004 deal, so the company's offer to renew the television rights was lower in 2004. =2005= Before the 2004‚Äì05 lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC (who would replace ABC as the NHL's American national broadcast television partner) and ESPN. ESPN offered the NHL $60 million for about 40 games (only fifteen of which would be during the regular season), all on ESPN2, with presumably, only some midweek playoff games, the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final and the All-Star Game airing on ESPN. NBC's deal involved a revenue sharing agreement with the NHL as opposed to a traditional rights fee, and included rights to six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and games 3‚Äì7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. ESPN had a two- year deal that they opted out of after the lockout, leaving the NHL without a cable partner. In August 2005, Comcast (who owns the Philadelphia Flyers) paid $70 million a year for three years to put games (54 or more games each season under the agreement, generally on Monday and Tuesday nights) on OLN, later known as Versus. Due to the abbreviated off-season, the 2005‚Äì06 schedule did not offer OLN exclusivity, which they received in 2006‚Äì07. Versus would also cover the playoffs and exclusively air Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals. During the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, CBC replaced Hockey Night in Canada with a block of Saturday night movies branded as Movie Night in Canada, hosted by Ron MacLean from various junior hockey venues. A labour deal was reached in time to contest the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season. CBC's own on-air talent was also locked out during the summer of 2005, nearly missing the start of the hockey season. Some journalists have suggested that this helped cause TSN and the CFL to end their sublicence deal with CBC after the 2007 season, as games from that league aired without commentary during the lockout. While there was no coverage during the 2004‚Äì05 season due to the lockout, HDNet instead, produced a series called NHL Relived,HDNet Gives Hockey Fans an Instant Replay with \\"NHL Relived\\" a special series featuring the best games from the 2003‚Äì04 season, including the NHL All-Star Game and Stanley Cup Playoff games. =2006= When HDNet's coverage resumed following the lockout, they reduced their schedule from 65 games to 52 games (bumped up to 53 the following year)NHL & HDNet Announce 2006‚Äì2007 HDTV Schedule on Thursday and Saturday nights.NHL & HDNet Announce 2005‚Äì06 HDTV Schedule By this time, it was apparent that HDNet would add games to this broadcast schedule bi-monthly so that they will be able to feature what they would consider hottest players,Two Young NHL Superstars Go Head-to-head This Saturday On HDNet teamsHDNet to present history in the making as the Buffalo Sabres go for new NHL record and match ups at the momentHDNet Announces Second Installment of NHL Season-Long Coverage Every Thursday and Saturday until the February Olympic Break (a flexible scheduleHigh Definition Network maintains a flexible schedule in order to feature top match ups as the race for the Stanley Cup beginsNHL & HDNet Announce \\"Flex\\" Game Schedule For December and JanuaryNHL & HDNet Announce HDTV Schedule for February NHL & HDNet Announce \\"Flex\\" Game Schedule For February and March in other words). NHL games officially returned to NBC under the new agreement on January 14, 2006, debuting with three regional games (New York Rangers at Detroit Red Wings, Colorado Avalanche at Philadelphia Flyers, which is aired on CSN Philadelphia also followed by the Dallas Stars at Boston Bruins) to substantial praise among hockey fans and writers, who often compare the television network's presentation to Hockey Night in Canada, which is broadcast in full on the NHL Center Ice package (although some writers even speculated that NBC's playoff broadcasts were superior to CBC's, largely because of their choice of announcers and the fact that NBC provided HD coverage of games prior to the Finals). Critics of what the show chooses to program allege that Hockey Night particularly favours the Toronto Maple Leafs. On March 11, 2006, CBC did not air the pre-game sweater retirement ceremony for Canadiens legend and credited slapshot inventor Bernard \\"Boom Boom\\" Geoffrion, electing to continue on with its planned broadcast of a Toronto Maple Leafs/Tampa Bay Lightning game. The decision was worsened by the fact that Geoffrion had died earlier in the day. CBC did devote portions of its coverage to Geoffrion, including a pre-game tribute, and acknowledgements during the first intermission and Coach's Corner, while the ceremony was broadcast in full by French-language outlets. A CBC spokesperson explained that the network had only received a \\"handful\\" of complaints surrounding the lack of coverage; if CBC had aired the ceremony in full, it would have pre-empted coverage of the Leafs game for 40 minutes. A writer for the Ottawa Citizen considered the decision to be an example of this perceived bias towards the Maple Leafs by CBC, believing that they did not want to \\"offend\\" their fans by not showing their game in full. Versus averaged a 0.2 Nielsen Media Research household rating, about level with the 2005‚Äì06 regular season NHL numbers and its 2006 prime time average. Beginning with the 2006 playoffs, Versus simulcast the CBC's coverage of some games, generally first and second round matchups from Western Canada, instead of using their own crews and announcers. In the early 1990s, SportsChannel America covered the Stanley Cup playoffs in a similar fashion. Versus continued to use CBC and TSN feeds to augment its own playoff coverage, sometimes even picking up a Canadian broadcast of a game involving two American teams. (NBCSN, Versus' successor, does so as well - even incorporating coverage from Comcast-owned regional sports networks.) In 2006, NBC televised Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Sabres and the Carolina Hurricanes on the same day as the Preakness. Before the game, Bill Clement advised the audience that in the event that the game went into overtime, it would be televised on Versus, or OLN as it was known at the time. The Sabres won the game in regulation. Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals were on OLN, while the remainder of the series was on NBC. NBC's broadcast of Game 7 drew a 3.3 rating, a 21% drop from ABC's 4.2 for Game 7 in 2004. However, some NBC affiliates didn't air Game 7 live. Overall, NBC had an average rating of 2.3 for its five telecasts of the final, down 12% from ABC's 2004 average. =2007= Olympic women's ice hockey champion Cassie Campbell joined Hockey Night in Canada in 2006 as a rinkside reporter, becoming (on October 14, 2006) the first woman to do colour commentary on a Hockey Night in Canada broadcast.Immodest and Sensational: 150 Years of Canadian Women in Sport, p.90, M. Ann Hall, James Lorimer & Company Ltd., Toronto, 2008, She filled in when Harry Neale was snowed in at his home in Buffalo. (Helen Hutchinson was the first woman to appear on HNIC telecasts in 1974, when she did between- period interviews on the Wednesday night CTV telecasts.) NBC's out-of-market games were available on NHL Center Ice through the 2006‚Äì07 season; NBC switched to stand-alone games for the 2007‚Äì08 season. For the 2006‚Äì07 season, NBC broadcast three regional NHL games per weekend of coverage during the regular season. The network also scheduled ten coverage windows during the playoffs (not including the Stanley Cup Finals). The additional broadcasts were expected to replace the Arena Football League, which NBC dropped after the 2006 season. NBC also produced two games per week in high definition, up from one in 2005‚Äì06. The newly titled NHL on NBC Game of the Week returned on January 13, 2007, with three regional games (between the Los Angeles and St. Louis Blues, Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers) at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Games started at various times, ranging from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. during the season (this variation primarily resulted from NBC's commitments to the PGA Tour and other programming). NBC moved its NHL telecasts to Sundays after its season premiere (which occurred on a Saturday) for the final eight dates of the season. The nine weeks of games (totaling 22 regional games) scheduled by the network amounted to the league's most extensive U.S. broadcast television coverage since , during Fox's tenure. A new Sunday Night Football-esque horizontal score banner, designed by Troika Design Group, also debuted during the season. Versus' coverage of the 2007 All-Star Game garnered a .7 rating (474,298 viewing homes and 672,948 total viewers). Ratings were down 76% from ABC's ratings in 2004, the last time the game was played, and down 82% from ABC's coverage in 2000. However, some of that significant drop can be attributed to the game being played on a weeknight (Wednesday) as opposed to the traditional weekend game, and the fact that Versus is a cable television network unlike ABC which is a broadcast network. The 2008 All-Star Game was scheduled for a Sunday. In 2007, Canadians accused the NHL of giving the CBC second billing to Versus' coverage of the playoffs. On May 19, 2007, during the Stanley Cup playoffs, NBC angered many fans and journalists when it pre-empted coverage of the overtime period of the tied Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres, instead going directly to pre- race coverage of the Preakness Stakes horse race. A typical \\"Triple Crown\\" horse racing broadcast generally contains about two hours of pre-race coverage, with the actual races lasting two or three minutes. Coverage of the overtime period was shifted to Versus, the league's cable partner, although viewers in Buffalo and Rochester were able to continue watching the game on local NBC affiliates in the respective markets, WGRZ and WHEC-TV. The move was originally seen not only as a snub of small-market teams (such as the Sabres), but of hockey in general. However, NBC and the NHL later revealed that the Preakness deal had been made several years before and contained mandatory advertising commitments during the pre-race build-up. Both sides could have agreed that the entire game would air only on Versus or begin earlier in the day, but the NHL wanted at least one Eastern Conference Finals game to air on NBC, and said that it does not schedule with the assumption that games will go into overtime. Moreover, an earlier start time could not be arranged because the broadcast window was fixed in advance, and both the NHL and NBC needed the flexibility to pick the Western Conference Finals for that window if they so desired. The 2007 Stanley Cup Final was also notable for its exceptionally poor television ratings in the United States. Games 1 and 2 were carried by cable channel Versus, then a new and little known player on the sports television scene. Game 1 produced a 0.5 national rating or 523,000 households. It was the 58th best rated program of that day. Game 2 produced a 0.4 national rating or 446,000 households, lower than the 2006 WNBA All-Star Game on ESPN which drew 447,000 households. It was the 74th best rated program of that day. The move to NBC did little to compensate for the series' limited drawing power. A perennial last among the Big Four American television networks, NBC was at the time going through an intense period of ratings turmoil, setting lowest rated week records in several viewing categories over the course of Spring 2007. Game 3's coverage on NBC garnered a mere 1.1 rating (approximately 1,205,600 households), making it the lowest rated prime-time broadcast in the network's history. For comparison, Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, broadcast opposite Game 3 on cable channel TNT, achieved a 5.3 rating, approximately 5,808,800 households. Game 4 achieved a 1.9 rating (approximately 2,082,400 households), down 5% from Game 4 the previous year. Game 5 received slightly less, 1.8 (approximately 1,972,800 households). As a whole, NBC's ratings for the championship series were down 20 percent from the previous season, making it the least watched final in the United States. At the time, Versus was only available to 50% of cable-equipped homes in the Los Angeles area, which hurt the buzz around the Ducks' playoff run in a traditionally crowded sports and entertainment market. Versus was the fifth- most watched cable network in the Los Angeles market for Game 1, good only for a 1.7 local rating. Local numbers did improve as the series moved to NBC. The Cup-clinching Game 5 drew a 6.0 and a 12 share for an average audience of 496,000 viewers in the Los Angeles market, twice larger than a high-profile regular season game between baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres on KCAL 9 (3.0/5, 218,000 viewers). This symbolic, if short-lived, victory against one of the region's flagship teams allowed the Ducks to close the series on a relatively high note, with the Los Angeles Times Larry Stewart calling their final ratings performance \\"pretty good\\". At the end of July 2007, RDS and the Montreal Canadiens extended their exclusive broadcasting rights contract through 2013. The deal included all of the Canadiens' 82 regular season games and all of their playoff games, if need be (none of this precludes CBC Sports from televising games in English as part of Hockey Night in Canada). Also, RDS had exclusive rights to French television broadcasting rights for the NHL All-Star Game and Skills Competition, as well as one NHL game per week that did not involve the Canadiens and a minimum of 40 playoff games for either RDS or RDS Info. The Canadiens also granted RDS exclusive rights to 'new media' coverage for the team (i.e., cell-phone TV, podcast and others).RDS - √Ä RDS jusqu'en 2013 Most other broadcast contracts were acquired through TSN and ESPN. =2008= Under the terms of the contract running from 2007‚Äì2011, Versus aired 54 or more NHL games each season, generally on Monday and Tuesday nights, and provided coverage of as many Stanley Cup Playoff games as possible (generally two per night in the first two rounds; the Conference Finals are usually played on alternating days), and two games of the Stanley Cup Finals (Games 3 and 4 in , and ). For the 2007‚Äì08 seasonHDNet to Open NHL Season With the First Game of 2007‚Äì08 Live from London ‚Äì Saturday, September 29 (HDNet's final season of NHL coverage), HDNet premiered the weekly program entitled Inside the NHL.National Hockey League and HDNet Join Forces to Take Fans \\"Inside the NHL\\" Hosted by Dan Moriarty, Inside the NHL featured programming regarding the upcoming game airing on HDNet, in-depth interviews with the biggest stars in the NHL, the latest news from around league, the top highlights from the current week, and unique features showcasing NHL's biggest stars as well as celebrity fans. Inside the NHL was shot on the location of every HDNet Thursday night NHL game. Beginning in , NBC incorporated \\"flex scheduling\\" for its NHL coverage, similar to NFL broadcasts. Through this method, the league selects at least three potential games at the start of the season for most of NBC's regular-season coverage dates. Thirteen days prior to the game, NBC then selects one to air as its Game of the Week, then the other two games move outside of NBC's broadcast window and return to teams' regional carriers. Since the league made network coverage a priority in the 1990s, regionalized coverage had been the norm; NBC is the first network to attempt to regularly present one game to the entire country. Additionally, studio segments began to originate from the game site instead of 30 Rockefeller Center. All game telecasts also began to be produced in 1080i high definition. NBC began its 2007‚Äì08 schedule on January 1, 2008, with the NHL Winter Classic, an outdoor hockey game between the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The game went head-to-head with some of the New Year's Day college football bowl games, but none of the feature Bowl Championship Series games. While never expected to beat or directly compete with football ratings, the timing was designed to take advantage of the large audience flipping between channels to watch the different bowl games. It was the first such game to be televised live by an American network and the NHL's first outdoor regular season game since the Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens played the Heritage Classic, which aired on CBC, which served as the Canadian broadcaster of the 2008 Classic. Although originally maligned as a mere publicity stunt by some in the media, the 2008 Winter Classic drew a 2.6 rating in the U.S. (or about 2.9 million viewers) according to Nielsen, the highest rating for a regular-season contest since February 1996, when Fox was the league's network partner. By comparison, CBS received a 2.7 rating for the Gator Bowl, which also had a 1:00 p.m. start. Beginning that season, all regular season telecasts air mainly on Sunday afternoons, except for those occurring the day after Thanksgiving and on New Year's Day. In April 2008, NBC announced the activation of its option to retain broadcasting rights for the 2008‚Äì09 season. NBC's scheduling for that year was similar to that which it had during the 2007‚Äì08 season (flex scheduling for regular-season games, up to five games of the Stanley Cup Finals ‚Äì changing in 2009 to include the first two and last three games, among others) except that all (or nearly all) of the Sunday-afternoon games now began at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Coverage again included the Winter Classic outdoor game on January 1, 2009, between the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks at Wrigley Field. In 2007‚Äì08, NHL audiences on Versus in the United States remained small, but increased over the previous two seasons. Versus averaged 246,154 viewers a game, up 24 percent from the previous year. Over the year, channel distribution increased to 73.6 million households from 70.8 million. Conference Finals ratings were averaging a 1.2 HH rating. Game 2 between the Flyers and Penguins drew a 1.7 HH rating, 2.3 million viewers; an NHL record on Versus. In June 2008, CTVglobemedia acquired the rights to \\"The Hockey Theme\\" after the CBC failed to renew its rights to the theme song. A re-orchestrated version of the tune, which had been the theme song of Hockey Night in Canada for forty years, has been used for hockey broadcasts on TSN and RDS since the fall of 2008.\\"CTV acquires rights to hockey theme song\\", CTV News, June 9, 2008 TSN announced on the September 24, 2008 edition of SportsCentre the debut date for the song. It began on October 14, when the Colorado Avalanche visited the Calgary Flames. =2009= Beginning with the 2008‚Äì09 season, Hockey Nights main games were simulcast weekly in the United States on NHL Network, complete with pre- and post-game shows. If U.S.-based teams appear in these games, the telecast is blacked out in the markets of the participating teams or is televised instead by the U.S. team's local broadcaster. For example, if the Toronto Maple Leafs host the Boston Bruins in \\"Hockey Night\\"'s main game, the NHL Network's telecast is blacked-out in the Boston area and the game is instead televised by the Boston-based New England Sports Network (NESN). In the 2009-10 season, only the first game of the HNIC doubleheader is simulcast live on NHL Network, with the second game and post-game After Hours program being shown in tape delay on Sunday, the sole exception being the Hockey Day in Canada event. Since the Rogers takeover, however, HNIC games on NHL Network now feature games regardless of broadcaster (either CBC or a Rogers network). NBC broadcast the first two and final three games of the Stanley Cup Final, while Versus broadcast Games 3 and 4. The first two games of the series were played on consecutive nights due to NBC's scheduling. Game 7 was the final major sporting event on analog television in the United States, with the DTV transition finishing less than an hour-and-a-half after the game ended and just one hour after NBC coverage ended. NBC affiliates WDIV-TV in Detroit and WPXI in Pittsburgh ‚Äì who months before the Stanley Cup playoffs began electing to keep their own respective analog signals on until June 12, well past the original February 17 deadline ‚Äì both remained on the air for Game 7 before cutting their analog signals at 11:59 EDT.

The BNP Paribas brand for independent asset managers, fund brokers, investment advisers and institutional clients was founded on 18 January 1994 as the first discount broker in Germany, trading under Direkt Anlage- und Verm√∂gensverwaltungs-GmbH, and started operations in May 1994 as Direkt Anlage Bank GmbH (DAB). As of 1 January 2016, the operating private customer business was transferred to the BNP Paribas S.A. branch Germany. On 12/13 November 2016, the DAB bank's online portal was shut down and all private customers transferred to Consorsbank. Business model The DAB is a direct bank that offers private individuals a free custody account. All common securities can be traded and stored via the bank. In addition, it advertises since February 2013 with a renewed banking offer with a free checking account in the center. As one of the first institutes to operate on the market without its own branch system, the DAB bank is competing with, among others, Comdirect, a subsidiary of Commerzbank. Other direct-bank competitors in Germany include ING-DiBa, Consorsbank, Sparkassen Broker and 1822direkt. Unlike its competitors, DAB has long renounced transaction numbers (TAN) and instead worked with a so-called trader password. Since the beginning of 2010, a system with a transaction number in the form of the mTAN procedure is offered. In addition to its private clients, DAB has also been in charge of financial intermediaries such as asset managers, fund brokers and investment advisers as well as banks and savings banks since its foundation. It offers institutional customers a central depository for securities of all asset classes. The fully integrated securities trading platform enables the trading of all types of securities at home and abroad in all common currencies via a custody account. With more than 9,000 funds of more than 200 CAGs, the DAB is one of the most important fund platforms for institutional investors in Europe. After \\"the stock boom around the turn of the millennium and the significantly decreased order numbers, it had missed the change from pure online broker to digital full bank.\\" In that course, the parent company BNP Paribas reorganized the business model in the context of the 1 January 2016 transfer of the operative business of the DAB bank to the BNP Paribas branch Germany. Deposits of Volkswagen Bank will continue to be held at the DAB BNP Paribas in Munich. Management The company is managed by Kai Friedrich (CEO). Stock market In 1999, the DAB bank was placed on the stock exchange. The company was listed in the Prime Standard. In 2001, the bank was listed as part of the acquisition of the French online broker Selftrade on the Nouveau March√© (New Market) of the Paris Stock Exchange - the delisting in France took place in 2010. As part of the takeover by BNP Paribas, the remaining minority shareholders were resigned and excluded by squeeze-out. The listing ended on 27 July 2015. Affiliation The institute was founded as a subsidiary of Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, which merged with Bayerische Vereinsbank in 1998 to form Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank. In 2005 it was taken over by Unicredit Bank. As of 28 February 2013, Unicredit Bank held 81.39% of the DAB bank shares, with 18.61% in free float. At the beginning of August 2014, the French major bank BNP Paribas, which also owns Consorsbank, acquired an 81.4% stake for ‚Ç¨ 354 million. According to initial planning, it should have come to a fusion of the brands DAB bank and Consorsbank by the end of 2014 in Germany, but the merger with the DAB was completed in early 2016. The DAB bank thus had the same fate as the Consorsbank, it was integrated into the BNP Paribas S.A. branch Germany. DAB was a member of the Cash Group until 31 January 2015. Statistics DAB is currently one of the leading direct banks in Germany in the securities business, in terms of client numbers and client assets. As of 31 December 2012, the DAB Bank Group had 597,128 customers, for which it managed 615,288 accounts with a combined client asset of ‚Ç¨28,38 billion. In 2012, it conducted 4,2 million customer transactions.

Heinrich Landwehr was a businessman-trader in Lohne, a small industrial town between Bremen and Osnabr√ºck in the north-west of Germany. The family were deeply religious. Two of his brothers also became priests and one of his sisters became a nun. When he was 13 he switched from the local middle school to the residential St. Joseph's Dominican Mission school (as the St.Thomas College was known at that time) at nearby Vechta (Oldenburg). He graduated from the school in 1932. =The Dominicans= That same year, on 12 May, he joined the Dominican community at Warburg (Westphalia) where he studied Theology and, in May 1936, made his religious vows. He was ordained into the priesthood by Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Hammels on 27 July 1938. Having concluded his studies he was transferred, in 1939, to the Dominican Monastery at D√ºsseldorf. However, war broke out in September 1939 and on 1 November 1940 Landwehr was conscripted for military service. Between 1941 and the end of the war he served with the army as a medical orderly on the Russian Front, which he was able to combine, unofficially, with extensive pastoral work. He became aware very early on of war crimes committed in the Soviet Union by German soldiers. In his autobiography, which appeared in 1995, he wrote of the mass murder of Jews, because of which his medical unit had not handed Jewish servicemen over to Nazi paramilitary (SS) units accompanying the army. But he would nevertheless bitterly reproach himself that he did not have the courage to protect more people from National Socialist savagery. He took the opportunity to learn Russian. In Minsk, where he was stationed for some time, and the surrounding area, where Catholicism remained (discreetly) the religion of a significant minority, he frequently celebrated Mass with congregations that included both local worshippers and off-duty German soldiers: this was strictly forbidden by the German military. By the end of 1944 the German army was being relentlessly pursued back towards Germany by then Soviet army. Early in 1945 Gordian fled with other German soldiers and civilians from Gdingen to Denmark where, by the time the war ended, he had become a prisoner of war. In the Autumn/Fall of 1945 he was moved to a British prisoner of war camp by L√ºtjenburg, near the coast north of Hamburg. In May 1946, after approximately a year of captivity, he was able to return to his monastery at D√ºsseldorf where he quickly built a name for himself as a particularly effective priest. =German Democratic Republic= At the start of 1951 he received a request from Father Dr. Wunibald Brachth√§user, who at that time was the Dominican Provincial Superior for the \\"Teutonia (German) Province\\", that he should relocate to Leipzig in order to take on a broader pastoral and missionary role. In 1949 the four military occupation zones into which the western two thirds of Germany had been divided in 1945 were relaunched as respectively the German Federal Republic (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1951 moving from west to east still involved a move in the opposite direction to that of the main current of migration across Germany. Landwehr accepted the request and during the first half of 1951 he made the journey from the west to Leipzig, traveling via Berlin. Leipzig was (and remains) traditionally a Protestant city, but with a substantial Roman Catholic minority. In summer 1951 work began on the construction of what became the St. Albert parish church in Leipzig-Wahren. It was the first new church to be built after the war in Saxony. A foundation stone was placed in October 1951 and just over a year later, on 15 November 1952, the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Mei√üen, Heinrich Wienken. At the same time the bishop elevated the existing Roman Catholic pastoral ministry to the status of a full parish, under the sponsorship of the Dominican Order. Gordian Landwehr became one of three priests responsible for the parish of Leipzig-Wahren. At a meeting of the priests of the Leipzig Catholic community (\\"...von Priestern im Leipziger Oratorium\\") it was agreed that a monthly sermon directly expressly at young people should be delivered in the Leipzig deaconate. Father Gordian Landwehr was allocated the first of these. The reaction of listeners to that first sermon was so positive that the next time the priests met together the priest from \\"Leipzig South\\" proposed that Landwehr should take on the entire series of \\"youth sermons\\". The meeting agreed. Landwehr's reputation as a preacher grew rapidly. His regular \\"youth sermons\\" at the university church became a popular institution. Landwehr had always seen his move to East Germany as something of a missionary project. He now began to travel extensively across the south of the country as a missionary-preacher, addressing congregations and listeners at Dresden, Berlin, Chemnitz, G√∂rlitz, Zwickau and a number of smaller towns. Young people seeking guidance remained a particularly important audience. There is an estimate that by the mid-1950s, beyond Leipzig, he was preaching in fifty towns and cities, and was reaching nearly 20,000 older teenagers and young adults a month with his sermons. The approach of the East German ruling party to organised religion was not as relentless as that of sister parties in some of the other Soviet Bloc socialist states. Nevertheless, the ruling parties could not be expected to welcome signs that a church organisation might be presenting itself as an alternative source of ideas or influence. Father Gordian Landwehr's popularity as a preacher did not go unchallenged in the media. An article appeared in the S√§chsische Zeitung describing Landwehr as a \\"NATO preacher in the robes of a Jesuit\\" (\\"Natoprediger im Jesuitengewand\\"). After such an unsubtle rebuke, leaders of the Dominican Order in West Germany expected that Landwehr would be arrested at any moment and requested his return to the Federal Republic. He himself was certain that the East German authorities would have welcomed such an outcome. But with the backing of the recently appointed Bishop of Berlin, Julius D√∂pfner, Gordian Landwehr chose to stay where he was, to the east of the internal frontier between the two versions of Germany. He ignored the preaching ban to which he was subjected and refused to be intimidated. From the perspective of one Christian commentator, \\"He continued to bear witness to the living God before the young people who were faced with a system that poured scorn and ridicule on a God that it tried to present as a fantasy figure\\". Supporters are convinced that, even though no other Catholic preacher was as openly critical of Communist ideology as he was, it was precisely on account of his popularity with his listeners that the party did not move more decisively against Landwehr. In his autobiography he himself later recalled an off-the-record remark from a party official in the late 1970s: \\"Father, here you have the freedom of the fool; you can say anything\\". =Divided Germany= The future division of Germany was implicit in the creation of the four military occupation zones in 1945: it was made explicit with the launch of the US sponsored and Soviet sponsored \\"German Federal Republic\\" and \\"German Democratic Republic\\" in, respectively, May and October 1949. There was no sudden erection of barriers in 1949, however, and through the first part of the 1950s it remained possible for people to pass between West and East Germany. After 1952 the physical barriers became more impenetrable, but for most of the decade it remained possible to cross the border between the \\"two halves\\" of Berlin, although movement restrictions, chiefly from the eastern side, became progressively more obstructive. Neither his high public profile nor the candour of his preaching did anything to earn Landwehr any special travel privileges. Like (almost) all East German citizens, the unexpected appearance of the Berlin Wall during the week of 13 August 1961 meant that for many years he was unable to visit the west. It would be a source of enduring regret that he was not even allowed out in order to be with his mother while she died or for her burial. The authorities also prevented him from attending his brother's funeral in the west. As vicar of the Dominican province covering an East German state that was becoming ever more effectively sealed off from the west Father Gordian became progressively more autonomous in taking on full responsibility for all Dominican activities in the German Democratic Republic. His activities as priest and overseer meant he was master of students and novice priest alike, as well as the order's point of contact for brother friars living and working - often \\"underground\\" - in the country's \\"fraternal neighouring socialist states\\". There were extensive contacts with Dominicans in Poland, and a welcome in Leipzig for any of the small number of Dominican friars from Czechoslovakia who managed to make the trip across the border. (Friars in Czechoslovakia generally had to conceal their religious connections from the authorities and undertake full-time day jobs in the secular world.) Appropriate special powers (\\"...eigenen Vollmachten\\") were delegated to Father Gordian by the Master of the Order. To the extent that travel restrictions permitted, Father Gordian also encouraged the use of his Monastery as an international meeting point for Dominicans from both sides of the \\"Iron Curtain\\". (Travel restrictions for westerners wishing to cross to the east were never as severe as those imposed on most East Germans wishing to visit the west.) =Paulinerkirche= In or before 1964 it became known that the city authorities' plans to redevelop the entire university complex had been approved by Walter Ulbricht. The plans involved blowing up the university church which, miraculously, had survived the wartime air raids almost completely unscathed. Landwehr preached regularly at the church to his youth congregations, and he spoke out against the decision to destroy the church. The decision processes moved slowly, and it was only in January 1968 that the architectural competition for the redevelopment took place. The church was nevertheless dynamited on 30 May 1968. Landwehr's opposition to the destruction of the church was widely supported, and a number of students and concerned citizens ended up in prison following street protests against it: Gordian Landwehr again remained at liberty, however. The redevelopment for which the church had been destroyed finally got under way in 1973 and was completed in 1978. Meanwhile, the venue for father Gordian's sermons to the students and other young people was switched to the city's Protestant St. Nicholas Church, one of the largest churches in Saxony and in the public eye during the late 1989 as the focus of the Monday demonstrations that adumbrated East Germany's return to democracy. =Ecumenist= While welcoming the changes that led to political reunification in 1990, the changes to which Father Gordian became particularly committed during the 1970s were those involving Christian unity. His practical co-operation with pastors from the Protestant churches in Leipzig was a practical demonstration of this. He was always happy to accommodate and Protestant pastors who asked to join the St. Albert Monastery for spiritual retreats and ecumenical training sessions. After reunification he received the Order of Merit (\\"Gro√ües Verdienstkreuz\\"), and was honoured with a laudatory address from the Minister-President of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf. In his brief reply Landwehr referenced the harmony between the church bells of the great Protestant parish church and those at his own catholic St. Albert Monastery: \\"There would be real harmony only if a centuries old yearning could finally be fulfilled: Christian unity in the world\\". =Later years= Father Gordian gave up his parish responsibilities in Leipzig-Wahren on health grounds in 1987, and in 1991 leadership of the St. Albert Monastery passed to a younger generation. After this partial retirement he nevertheless continued to preach at St. Albert and to other Catholic congregations in the city. Commentators assert that his longstanding fearless preaching, and his refusal to \\"keep out of politics\\" where the theme of a sermon incorporated political issues, made him an important prophet for the leaders and participants in the \\"Peaceful Revolution\\" of 1989/90.

The deal includes airings of games on the conventional over-the-air CBC Television network as well as carriage of those broadcasts through digital media, including CBCSports.ca. The deal came after controversy and discussion before and during the 2006-07 NHL season, when private broadcaster CTVglobemedia attempted to acquire exclusive Canadian distribution rights to the NHL for its own networks, including broadcast network CTV and cable channels TSN and RDS. Such a package, which would have left CBC without NHL hockey, would have increased TSN's previously existing coverage of NHL games; the attempt also came at a time when CTVglobemedia had outbid the CBC for Canadian television rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympics (along with Rogers Media), as well as the major television package for curling. Despite the rumours, it always seemed that CTV was unlikely to be interested in the nightly playoff coverage currently provided by the CBC, since weeknight games in April and May would conflict with new episodes of CTV's slate of American programming. As well, the title Hockey Night in Canada could not be used as the name is owned by CBC, unless CTVglobemedia were to pay royalties to CBC for use of the name. The current deal with CBC and Rogers maintains the 65-plus-year tradition of Hockey Night in Canada on CBC, but also allows Rogers to expand its coverage. A caveat of the deal limits CBC to the number of games per Canadian team it can show so that the seven Canadian-based teams, particularly the Toronto Maple Leafs, can distribute more games to regional carriers, thereby increasing the value of their local packages. Year-by-year breakdown =2010= For years, all playoff games involving Canadian teams were aired by the CBC, though not always on a national basis. From 2008 through 2014, rights to individual series were instead picked using a draft-like setup; in the first round, CBC first, second, fourth, and sixth selections among opening round series, and TSN had the third, fifth, seventh, and eighth selections. CBC tended to select series involving at least one Canadian team and series involving teams with strong Canadian fanbases (such as Boston, Buffalo, Detroit, and Pittsburgh); as a result of this arrangement, if more than two Canadian teams qualified for the playoffs, it was likely that at least one series involving a Canadian team would be broadcast by TSN. On July 23, 2010, Trevor Pilling was named the executive producer of Hockey Night in Canada, replacing Sherali Najak. =2011= NBC renewed its rights to the NHL for the 2010-11 season. The network broadcast schedule continued to include the Winter Classic, Sunday-afternoon games at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, six weekends of playoff action, and broadcasts of all but Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals. On February 20, 2011, NBC introduced Hockey Day in America ‚Äì patterned after the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada, it featured eight of the most popular American teams in regional games: the Washington Capitals at the Buffalo Sabres, the Philadelphia Flyers at the New York Rangers, and the Detroit Red Wings at the Minnesota Wild, followed by the Pittsburgh Penguins at the Chicago Blackhawks for the national nightcap. The Flyers-Rangers game was aired in the majority of the country, while the Sabres-Capitals game was only seen in the Buffalo and Washington, D.C. markets; as was the Red Wings-Wild game in their respective markets. The tripleheader would be completed with the 2011 Heritage Classic, for which viewers were redirected to Versus. On April 19, 2011, after ESPN, Turner Sports and Fox Sports placed bids, NBC Sports announced it had reached a ten-year extension to its television contract with the NHL (through the 2020‚Äì21 season) worth nearly $2 billion over the tenure of the contract. The contract would cover games on both NBC and sister cable channel Versus, which became part of the NBC Sports family as the result of Versus parent Comcast's controlling purchase of NBC Universal earlier in 2011. In relation to the contract's announcement, Versus would receive a new name to reflect its synergy with NBC Sports; the channel rebranded as NBC Sports Network on January 2, 2012 (it would later be abbreviated on-air and then officially shortened to NBCSN); NHL coverage on Versus would begin to be produced identically to NBC's NHL coverage beginning in the 2011‚Äì12 season, leading up to the brand change. The terms of the deal included: * A rights fee of roughly US$200 million per year for the combined cable and broadcast rights, nearly triple that of the previous contract; * Increased weekly regular season coverage on Versus/NBCSN (as many as 90 games per season on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights), with Sunday night games also being added by the channel later in the season. * Rights to an annual \\"Thanksgiving Showdown\\" game airing on NBC the day after Thanksgiving (\\"Black Friday\\" afternoon) (the 2012 edition was cancelled due to the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout). The November broadcast is the earliest an NHL regular season game has aired on a broadcast television network in the U.S. since the 1950s, when the league still only had six teams. The 2013 \\"Thanksgiving Showdown\\" game featured the Boston Bruins hosting the New York Rangers; it was widely expected that Boston will remain the home team in future years and launch a holiday tradition for the league and network (Boston has hosted matinee games the day after Thanksgiving since the 1980s), much like Detroit and Dallas traditionally host National Football League games on Thanksgiving Day; however, NBC decided to end this tradition for the 2014‚Äì15 season, with a Black Friday matinee between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers being aired instead, while Boston held a locally televised game on the evening of Black Friday in 2014. Boston resumed hosting the game in 2015, with a second Black Friday game (Chicago at Anaheim) airing later in the afternoon on NBCSN. * Continued coverage on NBC of the NHL Winter Classic, to be played on New Year's Day unless that day lands on a Sunday, in which case the game is moved to January 2 (despite the open time slot on Sunday afternoons, NBC is effectively forbidden via a gentleman's agreement with the NFL which prevents any form of strong counterprogramming against NFL games televised on CBS and Fox). Initially the Classic was expected to be played in primetime, however to date every game has been scheduled for a 1 PM ET start, and due to new competition from the College Football Playoff the game is now expected to remain a daytime game for the foreseeable future. NBC has instead opted to air one prime time game each year, later in the season, since 2014. * A national \\"Game of the Week\\" continuing on NBC as in previous years, beginning each January (January is the start month due to NBC's contract with the NFL). * Hockey Day in America becoming a permanent annual part of the NBC schedule. * Rights to any future Heritage Classics, which would be aired on NBCSN. * Digital rights across all platforms for any games broadcast by NBC or NBCSN. * Increased coverage of Stanley Cup Playoff games, with all playoff games airing nationally on NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, USA and NHL Network. (MSNBC and even Golf Channel have also been used for Stanley Cup playoff games.) Local sports networks can carry their teams' first-round games, but any games on NBC, and any NBC cable games from the second round onward, will be exclusive to NBC. * Continued sharing of the Stanley Cup Final on NBC (which will air Games 1, 2, and all \\"if needed\\" games) and NBCSN (Games 3 and 4). The deal gives NBC the option of moving Games 3 and 4 to the broadcast network. During the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, NBC aired Games 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 while NBCSN aired Games 2 and 3. Currently, NHL regular season games on NBC are exclusive to the network. While most NHL games on NBCSN are exclusive (such as Wednesday Night Hockey), other games carried by the network may be blacked out regionally in favor of television stations or regional sports networks which hold the local broadcast rights to an NHL franchise. Among the games normally blacked out from NBCSN include teams that are carried by their respective NBC Sports Regional Networks (Chicago Blackhawks broadcasts are shared between NBC Sports Chicago and WGN), as well as the Boston Bruins (NESN), Detroit Red Wings (Fox Sports Detroit), New York Rangers (MSG) and Pittsburgh Penguins (AT&T; SportsNet Pittsburgh). =2012= In preparation for the re-launch of Versus as NBC Sports Network (now NBCSN) in January 2012 as part of a major re-launch of the NBC Sports division coinciding with the 2012 NHL Winter Classic, all broadcasts on Versus transitioned to the NHL on NBC branding and presentation beginning in the 2011‚Äì12 season. Since the 2011‚Äì2012 season, NBC Sports and NBCSN have exclusive rights to the entire Stanley Cup playoffs starting in Conference Semifinals, and non-exclusive rights for the First Round, and will air each game nationally. =2013= In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Wednesday night games on NBCSN were rebranded as Wednesday Night Rivalry, primarily featuring rivalry games. For the 2013‚Äì14 season, NBC Sports introduced the series NHL Rivals, which looks back at the participating teams' historic rivalry leading up to the featured Wednesday Night Rivalry game. On November 26, 2013, Rogers Communications publicly announced its 12-year deal to become the exclusive national rightsholder for the National Hockey League beginning in the 2014‚Äì15 season. Valued at $5.2 billion over the length of the contract, and covering television and digital rights to the league (national French rights were sub- licensed to Quebecor Media for TVA Sports), the value of the contract surpasses the league's most recent U.S. rights deal with NBC by more than double. Under the contract, Rogers paid $150 million upfront, and will make annual payments beginning at $300 million, escalating to $500 million over the life of the contract. As part of the deal, Rogers also took over Canadian distribution of the NHL Centre Ice and GameCentre Live services. Rogers Media president Keith Pelley emphasized the increased amount and accessibility of NHL content that Rogers planned to offer under the deal, stating that \\"Canadians will have more games, more content and more choice than they've ever had before.\\" Also of note was Rogers' plans to maintain the long-running Hockey Night in Canada on CBC through a sub-licensing agreement with the league's previous broadcast television rightsholder, but also extend the brand by airing Hockey Night games across its own networks alongside CBC. Critics considered the deal to be a major coup against Bell Media, showing concerns for how its sports networks, particularly TSN, could sustain themselves without what they considered to be a key sports property in Canada. TSN and RDS still retain some NHL coverage as of the 2014-15 season, including TSN's existing rights to the Winnipeg Jets, an extension of French-language rights to the Montreal Canadiens for RDS, along with newly introduced regional coverage of the Toronto Maple Leafs for TSN (which are split with Sportsnet per Bell and Rogers' joint majority ownership of its parent company), and the Ottawa Senators for both TSN and RDS. =2014= As reflected by its influence, Fox Sports Net (Fox also held a minority stake in the channel upon its launch), Sportsnet and its four regional feeds also picked up regional broadcast rights to other Canadian NHL teams. As of the 2013‚Äì14 NHL season, Sportsnet held regional rights to five of the seven Canadian franchises, including the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs (which are jointly owned by Rogers and Bell Canada through a majority stake in MLSE), Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Vancouver Canucks. Rights to the remaining two, the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets, and national cable rights to the league as a whole, were held by the competing network TSN. National broadcast television rights were held by CBC Television, who used its rights to broadcast the long-running Hockey Night in Canada on Saturday nights, and share coverage of the post-season with TSN (including exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals). In the 2013-14 season, Sportsnet lost the Senators to TSN, but acquired rights to the Canadiens to replace them on Sportsnet East under a three-year deal. The contract expired after the 2016-17 season, and the team moved to TSN2 the following season; TSN's owner Bell holds an ownership stake in the Canadiens, as well as its regional French-language rights. Both Rogers and Bell own stakes in the Maple Leafs and split broadcast rights between them. On February 4, 2014 at the NHL's upfronts, Rogers unveiled more detailed plans for its NHL coverage. In preparation for the transition, Rogers and the NHL sought input from viewers via online surveys and a \\"listening tour\\" through locations within Canadian NHL markets, along with Kingston, Sudbury, and Red Deer, Alberta. These efforts focused primarily on gauging how viewers (including \\"core\\" fans, younger viewers, and those new to the country) consume NHL content, and help determine how Rogers would present, market, and distribute its overall coverage to these varying demographics. The hiring of George Stroumboulopoulos‚Äîthe former host of a self-titled CBC talk show and an alumnus of the now-Rogers owned sports radio station CJCL‚Äîas the main on-air host of Hockey Night, was intended to help the telecasts appeal to a younger audience. Rogers also announced plans to use its multicultural Omni Television stations to broadcast a doubleheader of Hockey Night in Canada games with commentary in Punjabi (carrying over from CBC's past digital coverage of games in the language), and ancillary hockey content in 22 languages, such as Hockey 101‚Äîan instructional series explaining the basic rules and concepts of hockey. Rogers sought to increase the prominence of NHL content on digital platforms by re-launching the NHL's digital out-of- market sports package GameCentre Live as Rogers NHL GameCentre Live, adding the ability to stream all of Rogers' national NHL telecasts, along with in- market streaming of regional games for teams whose regional rights are held by Sportsnet. GamePlus‚Äîan additional mode featuring alternate camera angles intended for a second screen experience, such as angles focusing on certain players, net and referee cameras, and a Skycam in selected venues, was also added exclusively for GameCentre Live subscribers who are subscribed to Rogers' cable, internet, or wireless services. Regular-season NHL telecasts on NBC itself usually only feature U.S.-based teams. During the Stanley Cup playoffs, broadcasting a game involving a Canadian team might be unavoidable. NBC has the first choice of games and times on its scheduled broadcast dates. The Canadian broadcasters (currently CBC and Sportsnet) are required to adjust accordingly during the playoffs, even though their rights fee is three times as high as NBC's. There have been a few exceptions to this policy since 2006; in 2008, the Montreal Canadiens became the first Canadian team featured on the NHL on NBC during the regular season (NBC Sports' Dick Ebersol was rumored to have specifically wanted to do a game from Montreal at some point). The Canadiens played the New York Rangers on February 3. The 2014 NHL Winter Classic also featured a Canadian team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, up against the Detroit Red Wings at Michigan Stadium. Due to the revamp of the league's conferences and divisions that season, the cross-border rivalry had become an interdivisional one with the Wings' move to the Eastern Conference. During the first three rounds of the playoffs, the NHL usually gives higher priority to NBC's requests to schedule afternoon games on the weekends, which results in little or no post-season contests on Saturday nights. This may include holding a playoff game on Saturday afternoon even if a Canadian club is the home team (like Game 1 of the 2014 Eastern Conference Final hosted by the Montreal Canadiens). In 2014, NBCSN broadcast Games 3 and 4, while NBC televised the remaining games. NBC Sports originally planned to repeat its coverage pattern from the last few seasons: NBCSN would televise Game 2 and 3, while NBC would broadcast Game 1, and then Games 4 and 5. After the League scheduled Game 2 on the day of the Belmont Stakes, coverage of Games 2 and 4 were switched so NBC's telecast of the horse race would serve as lead-in programming to game two. Due to the death of a family member, NBC lead play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick missed Game 1. Kenny Albert, who was also the New York Rangers radio announcer for WEPN and announced several national games (including the Western Conference Finals) for NBC/NBCSN, filled in for Emrick in the first game. Sportsnet's coverage premiered on October 8, 2014 with an opening night doubleheader of Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey, featuring the Montreal Canadiens at the Toronto Maple Leafs, followed by the Calgary Flames and the Vancouver Canucks. The inaugural game was the most-watched program of the night in Canada, and the most-watched telecast in Sportsnet's history, with 2.01 million viewers (beating the previous record of 1.44 million set by the Toronto Blue Jays' home opener in 2013, but since surpassed by multiple games of the 2015 American League Division Series involving the Blue Jays, which topped out at 4.38 million viewers for game 4). However, viewership was down from 2013's opening night game, which was televised by CBC. =2015= In the lead-up to the 2014-15 season, Rogers began to promote its networks as the new home of the NHL through a multi-platform advertising campaign; the campaign featured advertising and cross-promotions across Rogers' properties, such as The Shopping Channel, which began to feature presentations of NHL merchandise, and its parenting magazine Today's Parent, which began to feature hockey- themed stories in its issues. On May 28, 2014, Rogers announced a six-year sponsorship deal with Scotiabank, which saw the bank become the title sponsor for Wednesday Night Hockey and Hockey Day in Canada, and become a sponsor for other segments and initiatives throughout Rogers' NHL coverage. Beginning in the 2014-15 season, owing to Bell Canada's ownership stake in the Leafs' owner, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment and the loss of TSN's national cable rights, TSN began to air 26 regional games per season, split with Sportsnet Ontario, and aired by TSN4. Also beginning in the 2014‚Äì15 season, TSN Hockey personalities Bob McKenzie, Darren Dreger and Chris Cuthbert joined the NHL on NBC team. This was the result of Rogers Media's ‚Äì the owners of Sportsnet ‚Äì exclusive 12-year deal with the NHL in Canada replacing both TSN and CBC Sports as the rightsholders to the NHL. From 2014 to 2016, George Stroumboulopoulos served as the studio host for Hockey Night in Canada. Jeff Marek hosts Wednesday Night Hockey, while Caroline Cameron hosts Thursday night games along with Hockey Central Saturday. As of the 2018-19 season, Ron MacLean was reinstated as Hockey Night host; he continues to conduct the traditional Coach's Corner segment with Don Cherry. MacLean also serves as the on-location host for Hometown Hockey, accompanied by Citytv Calgary's Breakfast Television host Tara Slone. MacLean, Cherry and Oake were still under contract with the CBC, with Cherry under contract through 2018, and MacLean through at least 2016 for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2015, NBC Sports partnered with the league to expand Kraft Hockeyville into the United States. The annual contest, in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to ice hockey, with the winning community being awarded the opportunity to host a nationally televised NHL preseason game, was first held across Canada in 2006. Similar to what CBC Sports had done in covering Kraft Hockeyville in Canada, NBC Sports began airing regular segments on the separate Hockeyville USA competition for communities in the U.S. On September 29, 2015, NBCSN aired the inaugural Kraft Hockeyville USA game at Cambria County War Memorial Arena, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, marking the first time that the NHL on NBC televised a preseason game since it acquired the American rights in 2005. By January 2015, average viewership for Hockey Night east- coast games fell to 1.69 million viewers, in comparison to the average 1.8 million that CBC brought at the same point in the previous season; the poor performance of the heavily viewed Toronto Maple Leafs was partially blamed for the decline. Ratings for the 2015 NHL All-Star Game also fell sharply, losing over half its viewers in comparison to the 2012 edition. Moore disputed the accuracy of Numeris's numbers, arguing that they did not properly account for multi-platform viewership, and that its ratings panel did not cover enough sports-oriented demographics. Numeris acknowledged that it would look into Rogers' complaints, but noted that its ratings panels were meant to represent a wide array of Canadian demographics, and that, although they are not yet reported separately, its ratings did account for viewership on digital platforms. The Maple Leafs' ratings would fall as low as 743,000 viewers. Aggregate ratings began to recover by March; the March 21 east coast games (which saw the Maple Leafs' game moved to Sportsnet in favor of a Montreal Canadiens game on CBC) drew aggregate ratings of around 2.2 million viewers across CBC, City, and Sportsnet, with the Canadiens bringing 922,000 viewers. As part of a 2011 contract renewal, Comcast's properties earned exclusive national rights for all Stanley Cup playoffs through 2021. Because NBC and NBC Sports Network could not carry all of the games on those two outlets alone, other Comcast properties would need to be used; USA was initially not used, due to the risk of preempting its popular prime time lineup, and the company instead used CNBC and NHL Network as the overflow channels for the first four years of the contract. In 2015, Comcast announced that USA would carry some games in the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, mainly on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, returning the NHL to USA for the first time since 1985. Viewership rebounded for the 2015 Stanley Cup Playoffs, with five Canadian teams involved in the first round; average viewership of first-round games increased over the previous season, with one of the games in the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens' first round series on CBC seen by 3.76 million viewers. However, following the elimination of all Canadian teams from contention, ratings dropped significantly, with Numeris estimating an overall decrease of 8% in average viewership on CBC, and a 14% decrease in average viewership for Sportsnet in comparison to TSN's 2014 playoff coverage. With 2.62 million viewers, Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final was the lowest-rated deciding game since Game 7 in 2003; the game competed against a match of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup involving Team Canada on CTV and TSN (1.8 million), and a Toronto Blue Jays/New York Mets game on Sportsnet (782,000; the team was in the midst of a major winning streak). It was originally announced that Games 2 and 3 of the 2015 Finals were to be broadcast by NBCSN, with the remainder on NBC. Game 2 was moved to NBC to serve as a lead-out for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of Game 4 on NBCSN. As Eddie Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he was absent during Game 2. =2016= During the 2015‚Äì16 season, exclusive Sunday night games on NBCSN were rebranded as Sunday Night Hockey, with the first game under the new brand taking place on January 10, 2016 between the New Jersey Devils and the Minnesota Wild. A weekly recap show, NHL Sunday Shootout, premiered on the same day. NBC also began to air select Game of the Week and Sunday Night Hockey broadcasts under the Star Sunday banner starting with the 2016‚Äì17 season, devoting special coverage to the game's featured players of the week. Like its predecessors, NBC frequently chooses games with a focus on about six teams: New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Boston Bruins, and most recently the Washington Capitals and Chicago Blackhawks. The relation has very little correlation with team success; for instance, the Anaheim Ducks won the Stanley Cup in , and the Buffalo Sabres made it to the conference finals in both 2006 and 2007. Those teams received one and two potential games respectively in the 2008 season, compared to the seven potential games given to the Rangers and the four games which could include the rival Philadelphia Flyers. (Buffalo has fared better in its number of NBCSN appearances, due in part to the channel's relatively high viewership in the Buffalo market; it was noted in 2018 that their appearances on that network were in decline.)https://buffalonews.com/2018/08/13/despite-buzz- sabres-scheduled-to-get-only-five-national-broadcasts-this-season/ The most frequently cited reasons for this relative lack of diversity are low ratings in a market (such as for Anaheim, which competes with the older Los Angeles Kings in its market), market size (such as for Buffalo, where hockey ratings are the highest of any U.S. team, but the market itself is the smallest of any American NHL team), and Comcast's common ownership of both the Flyers and NBC, allowing the network to self-deal and cross-promote the Flyers on national television. Examples of the above trends could be found in NBC Sports' national schedule for the 2015-16 regular season. In a press release announcing this schedule, NBC stated all U.S. teams would make at least one appearance on NBC or NBCSN during the regular season, but hockey writer Greg Wyshynski noted that: * The Chicago Blackhawks (21), Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers (tied at 18), Detroit Red Wings (16), and New York Rangers (13) made the most appearances on the schedule. The Flyers were tied for second despite missing the playoffs during the previous season. * Five U.S. teams (the Arizona Coyotes, Carolina Hurricanes, Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers, and New Jersey Devils) only made 1 appearance each, while the Montreal Canadiens made 6 total appearances. * The Anaheim Ducks, who advanced to the conference finals during the previous season, only made 4 appearances, while the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose Sharks, who both missed the playoffs, appear ed 10 and 11 times, respectively. * The only Canadian teams to be scheduled were the Edmonton Oilers (despite drafting top prospect Connor McDavid with the first pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft) and Toronto Maple Leafs (despite having hired long-time Detroit Red Wings head coach Mike Babcock), both with one appearance each. The four remaining teams, who did each advance to the playoffs during the previous season, did not appear. Due to the revamp of the league's conferences and divisions that season, the cross-border rivalry had become an interdivisional one with the Wings' move to the Eastern Conference. The 2016 NHL Winter Classic had the Montreal Canadiens facing the Boston Bruins in Foxboro, Massachusetts. The Boston/Montreal rivalry is generally considered the fiercest in the NHL; in fact, there were rumblings that if Montreal were not Boston's opponent in the 2016 Classic that Boston would relinquish the game. NBCSN will occasionally feature Canadian teams during the regular season, but primarily only the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs, and only if they are playing a U.S.-based team. The NHL Heritage Classic matchups are the only all-Canadian regular season games that NBCSN has broadcast. On May 27, 2016, NBC Sports announced that if the Finals was tied at 1-1 entering Game 3, then it would have aired on NBC and Game 4 televised on NBCSN. However, if one team led 2-0 (as this eventually happened), Game 3 moved to NBCSN and then Game 4 on NBC. The 2016 season saw major ratings declines, with Hockey Night in Canada down 18%, Hometown Hockey down 34%, and ratings for the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs were down by 61% over the first five days of play, as no Canadian team made the playoffs for the first time since 1970. The lack of Canadian teams resulted in cuts to coverage; Sportsnet used just three dedicated play-by-play crews during the first round (with a fourth used for select games) and only produced its own coverage for games which aired on the CBC (all other games were simulcast from U.S. broadcasters). =2017= Beginning during the 2017 playoffs, NBC began to leverage its regional networks (then primarily-branded as Comcast SportsNet) to originate coverage of first-round games involving teams whose regional rights are owned by an NBC (in this case, Chicago, San Jose, and Washington). These broadcasts used the video footage from the regional broadcaster, overlaid with different commentary. In 2017, five Canadian teams qualified for the first round of the playoffs, which was expected to improve ratings. Scott Moore told The New York Times that he was extremely positive over the large number of Canadian teams in contention‚Äîthis time including the top Canadian media market of Toronto. He warned that \\"there's going to be a year where Edmonton is playing Montreal in the Stanley Cup final, and someone will think I'm a genius.\\" =2018= Prior to the 2017‚Äì18 season, TSN announced that they have reacquired the English-language rights to broadcast Canadiens games, replacing Sportsnet. John Bartlett, who handled play-by-play for Canadiens games on Sportsnet East, also moved to TSN, but returned to Sportsnet the following season. Soon after, long-time TSN talent Bryan Mudryk took over play-by-play duties. As of the 2017-18 season, Sportsnet's regional feeds collectively hold regional broadcast rights to four of the seven Canadian NHL franchises: the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sportsnet Ontario (split with TSN4), the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers on Sportsnet West, and the Vancouver Canucks on Sportsnet Pacific. The Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and Winnipeg Jets have regional television deals with TSN, and the Buffalo Sabres' Canadian regional rights are held by TSN parent company Bell Canada. The NHL refused to allow players to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament. Initially, in response to the NHL's decision, NBC elected not to air any NHL games during the three-week period on either the NBC broadcast network or NBCSN.NBC gives symbolic middle finger to NHL after Olympic call - Larry Brooks, New York Post, 23 September 2017 However, NBC later relented and added three Sunday afternoon games in February as a lead-in to the Winter Olympics. Sportsnet did not give any on-air assignments to Bob Cole during the 2018 playoffs‚Äîan exclusion that caught the veteran commentator off-guard. Over the 2018 off-season, Paul Romanuk departed Sportsnet, while John Bartlett (who called regional Montreal Canadiens games with Sportsnet through the 2016-17 season, and for the 2017-18 season with TSN2) returned to Sportsnet to call national games and regional Toronto Maple Leafs games. In 2018, while only two Canadian teams made the playoffs, they once again included the Maple Leafs, as well as the Winnipeg Jets‚Äîwho ultimately advanced to the Western Conference final, but were defeated by the Vegas Golden Knights in their inaugural season. Sportsnet stated that the Jets' second-round series had an average of 2.2 million viewers. =2019= For the 2018-19 season, NBCSN announced that it would re-brand its Wednesday Night Rivalry broadcasts as Wednesday Night Hockey, with a larger focus on showcasing star players rather than league rivalries. With these changes, the network promoted that its schedule would feature a wider variety of teams, including games between Canadian teams. The October 24, 2018 game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Winnipeg Jets marked the first time that NBC had ever originated its own telecast of a regular season game between Canadian opponents. In March 2019, it was announced that Sportsnet had partnered with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) to simulcast the Montreal Canadiens/Carolina Hurricanes game on March 24 with commentary in the indigenous language of Plains Cree. It was the first-ever NHL broadcast in the language: Clarence Iron of Pinehouse, Saskatchewan's CFNK-FM (who is known locally for his radio broadcasts of indigenous teams in the language) served as the play-by-play announcer, while former NHL player John Chabot and Northern Cree member Earl Wood hosted the studio segments. Alongside the broadcast, Hometown Hockey also originated from the Enoch Cree Nation reserve outside of Edmonton.

She undertook empirical work on poverty and economic development, developed statistical tools to project poverty and inequalities at the local level, and a policy system to provide access to drugs for developing countries without violating drug manufacturers' patents. Biography  Jean Olson Lanjouw was born on April 15, 1962 in Seattle, Washington, to Joann and Bruce Olson. She had one brother, Eric. The family moved to Oxford, Ohio when Lanjouw was a child. She graduated summa cum laude with Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in mathematics and economics from Miami University. Lanjouw garnered an interest in the economics of developing countries while she was attending a year-long master's program at Delhi School of Economics in the mid-1980s. She later earned a master's degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1987, and went on to achieve a doctorate at the same institution five years later. In 1992, Lanjouw moved to Washington, D.C. and was a commuter to her position as economics professor at Yale University. She joined the faculty as associated professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics in July 2003. Lanjouw was a non-resident senior fellow in economic and governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a non-resident senior fellow for the Center for Global Development, and a research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. She focused her time on empirical work on poverty and economic development, on law and economics, and on the economics of changes in technology. Lanjouw studied the role of land titles in Guayaquil's urban squatter communities and emphasized their interaction to informal property rights. She developed statistical tools to combine census and detailed survey data to view poverty and inequality from either the village or neighborhood level. Lanjouw examined the effects of a requirement by the World Trade Organization to require many developing countries to introduce pharmaceutical patents, and developed a policy mechanism to create a patent system to adapt to the development of individual countries and the importance of their product markets. It would provide poor countries with access to drugs at a low cost without violating drug manufacturers' patents. Her work was published in several multiple journals, such as The Review of Economic Studies, Econometrica, Journal of Development Economics, Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, and The Journal of Industrial Economics. Lanjouw also organized conferences on patent reform and statistics, and she consulted for the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and statistical organisations in South Africa and Brazil. In August 2005, she was diagnosed with renal cell cancer, and died on November 1, 2005, at her home in Washington, D.C. Services to commemorate her life were held in Washington, D.C. Personality and personal life Known as \\"Jenny\\" by friends and colleagues, Lanjouw was a popular individual from combining \\"charm, humor, and a keen sense of intellectual curiosity in her interactions.\\" She was enthusiastic, detailed in her work, friendly with students, and treated all equally regardless of seniority. Lanjouw was married to World Bank economist Peter Lanjouw and they had two children. Legacy After her death, a memorial fund called the Jean O. Lanjouw Memorial Fund was established in her honor by the UC Berkeley Foundation. Her husband explained that the fund was established to ensure her work could be continued by future generations via sponsorship.

Asfendiyarov graduated in 1912 from the St Petersburg Military Medical Academy. Serving as a medical doctor early in the war with Germany, he was taken prisoner in East Prussia in December 1914, and held in various concentration camps until December 1915, when he was able to return to St Petersburg via Sweden, during a prisoner exchange organised by the International Red Cross. After the February Revolution in 1917, he was elected to the Bukhara regional soviet of workers' and soldiers' delegates. In 1918, he served with the Red Army in the war against the Emir of Bukhara. He joined the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919. In 1919 ‚Äì 1925, Asfendiyarov worked in the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, as People's Commissar for Health, 1919‚Äì20, and 1923‚Äì24; and for Agriculture, 1921-22, and as a secretary of the Central Committee of the Turkestan Communist Party, and a member of the Central Asian bureau of the All-Russian Communist Party.  Academic career  In 1927 ‚Äì 1928 years S.Zh.Asfendiyarov was Director of the N.N.Narymanov institute of Oriental studies, in Moscow, in 1927-28, and simultaneously a Professor of Moscow State University. From 1928, he was based in Kazakhstan, where he founded the Kazakh teacher training college (now the Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University), and was the first rector of Almaty Medical Institute (1931-1933), now the S.F Asfendiarov Kazakh National Medical University, which is named after him. He did a lot of work on the prevention of infectious diseases, on the rendering free medical care to the population of the republic, and helped with the eradication of tuberculosis, smallpox, plague and skin diseases.  Arrest and execution  Asfendiyarov was arrested in Moscow on August 22, 1937 and was expelled from the Communist Party on September 27, as a \\"cpounter-revolutionary nationalist\\". He was moved to Almaty where he was interned in a temporary insulator. He was sentenced to death by shooting on February 25, 1938.  Rehabilitation  Asfendiyarov was rehabilitated by a decision of the USSR Supreme Court on May 26, 1958. In 1962, Naberezhnaya Street, in Almaty, was renamed S. Afendiyarov Street. On 11 January 1989, the government of the Kazazhstan Republic renamed the Almaty Medical Institute after him.  Published works  S. Asfendiyarov, History of Kazakhstan (1935) S.

The stone-clad courthouse around the corner from it opened nine months later in 1879. The new prison initially accommodated 110 male and female inmates. It was further reconfigured and by 1911 the average occupancy was 198: 162 men in 34 cells and 36 women in 8 cells. It served as a remand prison for people awaiting trial and for holding those convicted of property offences, fraud and violent crime. People were also incarcerated on political charges such as L√®se-majest√© and going on strike. Newspapers editors who published articles in favour of social democracy could also be imprisoned. After World War 1, during the Weimar Republic era, considerable renovation and modernisation work was carried out using prisoners' labour. By 1932 the average number of inmates was 253. = Nazi era 1933‚Äì1945 = Andreasstra√üe 37, Erfurt. The former prison opened in 1878. During the Nazi era there was widespread abuse of police powers. People could be arrested without reason and held in prison indefinitely; they were persecuted for their faith, sexual orientation and political beliefs. The Andreasstra√üe prison was used primarily to hold \\"Andersdenkende\\" (literally: \\"differently-thinkers\\") i.e. anyone who dissented from the views of the Nazi party. In 1939, at the start of World War II, the basement of the prison was altered so that it could be used as an air raid shelter. The prison became so overcrowded that political detainees were also held in a police detention centre at Petersberg Citadel, which is on a hill immediately behind Andreasstra√üe. That prison also became over-crowded. By 1943 the number of inmates in the Andreasstra√üe prison had grown to 350 and at the end of the war, in 1945, it held 400 prisoners. = Soviet occupation 1945‚Äì1949 = Erfurt was liberated by the US 80th Infantry Division on 12 April 1945. The American administration closed the Andreasstra√üe prison. Political prisoners were released and other inmates were transferred to other prisons in Thuringia. As had been agreed at the Yalta Conference, Thuringia was handed over to the Soviet military administration in the first week of July. It confiscated the prison building and used it for storage. Later it was used for the \\"preventative detention\\" of people with \\"unstable lifestyles\\", such as the homeless and alcoholics. Nazis and those suspected of anti- communist activities were interned in Special camp number 2 at the former Buchenwald concentration camp site. Under the Soviet administration many people who were convicted of political crimes were given the death penalty. From 1948 the Andreasstra√üe prison was again used for holding for convicts and remand prisoners. It had 42 single and 36 shared cells; the number of people held fluctuated on a daily basis from 212 to 310.

The Landespolizei, the state police force, were put in charge of the Andreastra√üe prison. Most of the prisoners were being held for crimes such as theft, burglary, or \\"Arbeitsbummelei\\" (being lazy or careless at work). The Ministry of State Security (Stasi) was established on 8 February 1950.The Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (BStU). The Founding of the MfS. Retrieved 21 August 2019 It functioned as the country's secret police, intelligence agency and crime investigation service, all in one. It grew to have around 270,000 people working for it, including about 180,000 informers, or \\"unofficial collaborators\\". The administration of the GDR was centralised in August 1952. The five former East German states were dissolved and the country was reorganised into districts (Bezirke). Thuringia was divided into three districts: Erfurt, Gera and Suhl. The separate state police forces were merged into the centralised Volkspolizei. The Andreasstra√üe prison became a facility shared by the Volkspolizei and the Stasi; the Stasi's Erfurt district headquarters was set up at Andreasstra√üe 38, neighbouring the prison. The Volkspolizei used the basement and ground floor of the prison and the first and second floors were used by the Stasi for holding and interrogating remand prisoners. About 90% of all arrests by the Stasi were on political grounds. Women were held on the first floor and men on the second floor. The Stasi floors were set up to hold a maximum of 96 detainees; by 1962 there were 121, and by 1989, the year the Berlin wall was opened, there were over 300 inmates. The first director of the Stasi part of the prison was Lieutenant Willi Stettner, a former inmate of Buchenwald concentration camp. Between 1952 and 1989 over 5000 political prisoners were held and interrogated in the Andreasstra√üe prison. It is not known precisely how many people were detained on political grounds in the whole of the GDR, but it is estimated that alone during the period when Erich Honecker was General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, May 1971 to October 1989, the number was around 35,000. In October 1972, as part of the celebrations of the 23rd anniversary of the GDR's founding, Erich Honecker announced an amnesty for over 42,000 \\"political and criminal perpetrators\\". It was not a full amnesty, but those who had been convicted and were still in prison had their sentences commuted to three-years probation. This was the first time GDR had publicly acknowledged that it had political prisoners and it caused a sensation in the West. However, it had been known at government level much earlier than that. Political prisoners had been ransomed to the West German government since the early 1960s. According to the historian Andreas Apelt, \\"Between 1964 and 1989 some 33,755 political prisoners and 250,000 of their relatives were sold to West Germany, for a sum totalling 3.5bn Deutschmarks\\".Haines, Gavin (6 November 2014) East Germany's trade in human beings on BBC News Online.

Retrieved 30 July 2019 On the 28 October 1989, to try to calm protests against the government, an amnesty was issued for those being held for border crimes or for participation in the weekly demonstrations that were happening all over the country. After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, the Ministry for State Security was renamed the \\"Office for National Security\\" (German: Amt f√ºr Nationale Sicherheit) on 17 November 1989. It was dissolved on 13 January 1990. Its records are managed by the Stasi Records Agency. On 6 December 1989, the Council of State issued an amnesty for all political prisoners. This is known as the \\"Gerlach Amnesty\\", after Manfred Gerlach, the last Head of State of East Germany. After German reunification on 3 October 1990, the administration of the Federal Republic took over the prison. It closed in 2002. = Reasons for imprisonment = Charges included accusations of spying, sabotage, \\"political diversion\\", \\"underground activities\\" or \\"anti-democratic agitation\\". After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, offences relating to trying to escape to the West became the main political crimes, especially in Thuringia which had the Inner German border on its western and southern perimeters. Examples of detention in Andreasstra√üe prison include: *Johannes H√ºtcher, 20, who in 1960 shouted abuse and threw a plum jam sandwich at a photograph of Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, which was hanging in his workplace staffroom. He was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for \\"State-endangering propaganda and agitation\\". * Rosel Schatz, 30, who in 1981 wrote love letters to her fianc√© in West Germany which were intercepted by the Stasi. In one of these she told him she had applied for an \\"Ausreiseantrag\\" (a permit to leave East Germany). She was accused of \\"treasonous sharing of information\\" and sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment in Hoheneck women's prison. After a year she was ransomed to West Germany. *The H√∂felmayr family from Eisenach in Thuringia, tried to escape over the Czech border to Austria in 1983. The father received one year and 10 months, the mother one year and six months, the daughter, 17, one year and the son, 18, eight months. *Marilene Bornemann, who during the East German uprising of 1953, with her husband Winfried distributed leaflets calling for free elections and a united Germany. In October 1953, Winfried Bornemann was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, and Marilene to four years. While on remand in Andreasstra√üe she realised she was pregnant. She gave birth in a prison hospital at Meusdorf near Leipzig in June 1954 and was separated from her child for two years. She was held in the \\"Roter Ochse\\" prison in Halle until she was released in May 1956. Her husband was released in December 1960. *In November 1976, the sing-songwriter Wolf Biermann was \\"ausgeb√ºrgert\\", i.e. stripped of his East German citizenship and banned from returning to the country, while he was in Cologne on an officially authorized tour of West Germany.Biographische Datenbanken.

After his exile, in 1976 and 1977 there were numerous arrests of people who supported him. In Erfurt, about 30 people who had signed a petition supporting Biermann were interrogated in Andreasstra√üe and sentenced from 1 year to 14 months imprisonment. *Josef Bl√∂sche, a member of the SS who is shown pointing a gun in the direction of a small boy in the iconic 1943 photograph Warsaw Ghetto boy, was arrested by the Stasi in 1967 and held in Andreasstra√üe prison in 1969 while he was on trial in Erfurt for Nazi war crimes. He was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity and executed in Leipzig. =Prison conditions= Shared men's cell, former Andreasstra√üe prison People could be held on pre-trial detention for months. A three-month maximum limit for preliminary investigations was set in the criminal procedures code, but the unit that investigated political cases could extend investigations anytime it wished. The average detention period in the Andresstra√üe prison was 100 days; 64 days on average for the investigation, and if convicted, a further 36 days waiting to be transferred to one of several of prisons that held political convicts. Physical and psychological abuse were common, particularly in the first half of the 1950s. Protestaktion: Ex-H√§ftlinge besetzen ehemaliges Stasi-Gef√§ngnis in Spiegel Online, 2 January 2010. Retrieved 2 August 2019 Interrogations were carried out day and night, with sleep deprivation leading to false confessions being signed. Later, more subtle forms of mental pressure were used. Prisoners were impersonalised by being addressed only by their prison numbers, not by name. They were checked on frequently via spy holes in the cell doors, with lights turned on and off every 20 minutes during the night. The cells had glass brick windows, so that prisoners had no view of the outside. The prisoners were only allowed out of their cells to go to interrogations and for a 30-minute per day visit to the exercise yard, which was divided up into separate, walled spaces. There was a system of \\"traffic lights\\" in the corridors, so that prisoners couldn't see or pass each other when they were being taken outside of their cells. Prisoners who were held in isolation cells developed an alphabetical code for knocking on the walls in order to communicate with each other. Prisoners could write four letters per month, which were checked by prison staff; they were not allowed to contain any comments about the criminal proceedings or prison conditions. One visitor per one month was allowed. = Occupation of the Stasi headquarters and prison = In 1989 and 1990, there were widespread anti-government protests and strikes in towns and cities throughout East Germany, demanding the opening of the borders with the west, human rights protections and genuine democracy. This period, which led to the opening of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and German reunification on 3 October 1990, is known as the Peaceful Revolution. In Erfurt, from early October 1989 the protests usually took place every Thursday in Domplatz, the Cathedral square neighbouring the Andreasstra√üe prison.

More than 500 people gathered outside and vehicles were used to block the exits. Police who were present refused to help the Stasi employees. The protesters went through the building looking for documents. They came across areas which were completely empty, but later found rooms full of shredded paper. In the basement they found a large incinerator, with sackfuls of files and letters ready to be burned, and the ashes of those that had already been destroyed. The occupiers stored some of the material in detention cells in the basement of the building, and also occupied the empty second floor of Andreasstra√üe prison. Over the next few days files from the Erfurt district headquarters and other Stasi offices around the region were stored in cells in the empty men's section.

The action quickly inspired further occupations of Stasi offices throughout East Germany, starting that same evening in other towns in Thuringia as well as in Leipzig and Rostock. The occupations led to the protection of Stasi files and ended the fear East German citizens had of the Stasi, the last bastion of the SED dictatorship. The Stasi was dissolved on 13 January 1990.

In 1939, the owners Franz √ñhler, Richard Kastner (1875‚Äì1959), and Albert Kastner sold the company to their sons-in-law, to avoid confiscation by the Nazi regime. They escaped to Croatia, but √ñhler was arrested and died at Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945.

Marathon Investigation Blog  Murphy became interested in investigating suspected marathon cheats after reading posts on LetsRun.com about Mike Rossi, suspected of cheating at the 2014 LeHigh Valley Marathon. This led him to start the Marathon Investigation website and blog in 2015, and to begin looking at individuals who might have cheated in order to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Over time, he began to look at cheats as well as so-called 'bib bandits' in other events. Murphy compares race times to find likely cheaters, and assesses publicly available Strava data as well as race photos, chip splits and eyewitness statements to determine whether runners have cheated. His investigations are regularly picked up by national and international press, notably in the case of Murphy identifying over 300 cheats at the Honolulu Marathon. An investigation by Murphy and others on running forums of Frank Meza, a \\"lifelong runner\\", also attracted widespread press. Meza supposedly ran \\"faster than the official world record\\" for his age group and was disqualified and banned from multiple races for suspected cheating. He subsequently took his own life, leading some to criticize an online culture that 'hounded' and 'bullied' suspected cheats. = Criticism = Murphy's approach has attracted criticism within the running community and from external commentators who feel his investigations expose people to disproportionate backlash for a relatively minor offense.  Personal Life  Murphy lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he works as a business analyst. He is married with two children and is a former slow hobby runner himself.

She is also known as an associate of Andy Warhol, working with him on Interview magazine. She was born in 1951, in New Mexico, but moved to the United Kingdom that year when her father, an officer with the USAF was posted there. Kwiatkowski describes growing up British. However her family later moved to Paris, when her father was posted to France. She married Joseph Allen, described then as a \\"newsprint entrepreneur\\", when she was 19 and he was 29. Allen bought a share of Interview, which he put in Barbara's name, \\"so she would have something to do\\". Fran Liebowitz, also an associate of Warhol, said her marriage to Allen was essentially over, after Barbara joined the Warhol entourage. After joining the Warhol entourage, and starting a career in modeling, Barbara became someone whose partying became noteworthy. During the next decade, in addition to working with Warhol, Barbara modeled, tried appearing in movies, and rebuffed many ardent admirers. In the mid-1970s she was the girlfriend of Peter Beard, a celebrated photographer. She described one incident where, early one morning, Mick Jagger tried to sneak in her bedroom window, only to sneak into the window of Beard's bedroom. She said the three of them had a good laugh over Jagger's misadventure. In another account Jagger snuck into the window of houseguest Bob Colacello. Other boyfriends and admirers from this period included Taki Theodoracopulos, Philip Niarchos, Ilie Nastase and Warren Beatty. She met Henryk de Kwiatkowski in the mid-1980s, and married him in 1986. Henryk was a wealthy Canadian aircraft broker. He was 31 years older than she was. Barbara and Henryk were married until his death in 2003. Their child, Nicholas, was born in 1989. Warhol published his diaries in 1989. They mentioned Barbara 73 times, and contained many embarrassing details. She described how Henryk's grown children from his first marriage were shocked, and showed the diaries' account of Barbara's wild times to their father. She said he told her he didn't care. The New York Times profiled her again, in August 2019, when she put the 5,000 square foot Manhattan apartment she had shared with her husband up for sale. The article noted that, while she and her husband had used the apartment's large spaces to host parties attended by \\"bold-face names\\", she now lived a more retired life-style, and would be more comfortable in a smaller space.

It is regarded as the first and most successful alternate school for North Korean defector youth, having produced over 160 graduates since its founding. History The Heavenly Dream School (HDS) was founded in March 2003 by Rev. Im Hyangja. In 2015, the school was accredited by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education. In 2017, the school held a 'Night of Thanks' in preparation for its 15th anniversary that involved school donors and graduates. Activities The school focuses on preparing the defected North Korean youth for a successful career in South Korea and as leaders for reconstructing North Korea after unification. Educating the defectors is said to be difficult due to the differences in the South and North Korean educational and political systems. To handle this problem, the school focuses in a specialized program focusing on the student's academics, leadership, spirituality, and career. The students without family in South Korea live in dormitories around the school in small groups and are taken care by a school teacher or a volunteer. The school organizes an annual English Unification Camp (EUC) in the summer where students from Heavenly Dream School and South Korea come together for 5 days. In the camp, they are exposed to the situation in North Korea and gain awareness on the issue of unification. The entire camp is conducted in English and features around 100 volunteer staff from over 10 countries. In the winter, the school hosts a 10-day intensive leadership training in English known as DTS (Discipleship Training School). This camp features students from HDS and seeks to develop their leadership and English skills to help with unification with the help of volunteer staff.

These interstate trains were from Murray Bridge to Serviceton and they also served the northern lines. These locomotives easily reached speeds of 60 M.P.H. which was required to run these services. They were often seen \\"double heading\\" with the S class locomotives on express passenger trains. Q class locomotive No. 90 lingered on a long time after the demise of the rest of its class members. No. 90 worked local trains between Murray Bridge and Tailem Bend and in its final three years of life it spent its time as shunting locomotive at the Islington Railway Workshops.

It was released on various home computers including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Commodore 64, DOS and ZX Spectrum. An Atari ST version was planned by Nathan Software but got no release. The game was released in five different languages including English, Spanish, French, Italian and German. Plot The Alphabet pets have escaped from the toybox is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's bedroom and are roaming around Donald's house. It is up to Donald to catch them and bring them all together. Gameplay The player helps Donald to catch runaway letters. The gameplay is pretty straightforward. In each room of his house, Donald will chase three, four or five letters. The player is required to press a letter on the keyboard which corresponds to the letter that Donald is trying to catch. Educational goals The game was designed on a low budgethttp://svn.dridan.com/sandpit/QA/trecdata/datacollection/sjm/sjm_017 with the ability to teach literacy at a basic level, letter recognition and simple keyboard typing skills as well as reinforcing knowledge on uppercase letters and thus teaching them how to match letters of the alphabet with the letters on the keyboard. The structure of the letters divided into five rooms allows children to understand and learns different letter groups. Children can freely explore the game, while parents can guide them depending on their abilities. Reception =Critical reception= A Computist reviewer gave the Apple II version 3 out of 5 stars, praising the game's animation and decent sound, but deeming it lacking in challenge. Amiga Format gave the Amiga version 4 out of 5 stars, finding the animations hilarious to watch, but finding the use of uppercase letter limiting in teaching material. =Commercial performance= The game along with Mickey's Runaway Zoo and Goofy's Railway Express sold around 400,000 copies in a year of their development. The Amiga version was showcased at the 1990 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. By April 1991, the Amiga version became one of the top 10 selling products in the UK. By October 1991, the game was showcased at the annual Windhoek Show as part of Schoemans Office Systems.

Whatever happened to: The Military Draft. The News-Gazette. January 31. Year 164, No. 186. Upon completing military service in 1971, he enrolled in graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), completing his M.S. degree in 1973. He continued working as a Graduate Research Assistant, receiving a Ph.D. from UIUC in 1976 with his thesis in the area of energy metabolism.  Career  Immediately after completing his Ph.D., Kelley joined Washington State University as an Assistant Professor and conducted research there until 1984. In 1982, he was invited by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) for a one-year research project, which he completed in Paris, France during a sabbatical from Washington State University.Kelley, K.W., R. Dantzer, P. Mormede, H. Salmon and J.M. Aynaud. 1984. Conditioned taste aversion induces immunosuppression in the absence of an immunosuppressive drug. Comptes Rendus des Seances de l‚ÄôAcademie des Sciences. Serie III. 299:123 126. In 1983, he was awarded a fellowship from the French medical research branch, Institut National de la Sant√© et de la Recherche M√©dicale (INSERM), to conduct investigations on catecholamines and immune function. In 1984, on returning to the United States, Kelley left Washington State University to return to the UIUC as a Professor in the Department of Animal Sciences. He was awarded a fellowship by the French government branch, Ecole Practique des Hautes Etudes and INRA in 1987 to conduct investigations on neuroendocrine and immune functions during aging. From 1987 to 1988, Kelley served as the first Program Manager for the USDA Competitive Biotechnology Program in Animal Growth and Development. Kelley joined the Department of Pathology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC) in 2006. There he worked to expand the collaborative efforts of the Integrative Immunology and Behavior (IIB) Program in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and College of Medicine. One of Kelley‚Äôs major scientific efforts was in service of the journal, Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. From 1990 to 2002, Kelley served on the Editorial Board. He was then asked to serve as only the second Editor-In-Chief of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. He served in this capacity from 2003 to 2017, during which time the significance of the journal rose rapidly, as assessed by 3-fold rise in the impact factor of the journal. Under Kelley‚Äôs editorship, the journal was ranked by the ISI Web of Science in the top 15% of all scientific journals in the categories of both neuroscience and immunology, and more recently in psychiatryKelley, K.W. 2017.

He has also been on the Editorial Boards of the International Journal of Medical Sciences and the International Journal of Tryptophan Research. Kelley has been involved with corporations and organizations as a consultant. He has been a consultant to International Minerals and Chemical Corporation (1986-1987), Farmland Industries (1989), Marion Merrell Dow (1990-1993) and the Electric Power Research Institute (1994-1998). He served as a consultant with Pfizer Global Research in 2001 and for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals in 2009. = Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society = Throughout his career, Kelley has been involved in many capacities with the non-profit research organization, the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society, which officially was established in 1993. He was elected as a Scientific Councillor for a two-year term starting in 1992, and then served as the second Secretary-Treasurer of the new Society from 1994 to 1998. He was elected as the President of the society in 1999Kelley, K.W. 2001. Presidential Address: It‚Äôs time for psychoneuroimmunology. Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 15:1-6. and later served on the Web Transition Committee, Finance Committee and Communication Committee and ad hoc as the Editor-in-Chief of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. In 2012, Kelley initiated the first effort of the PNIRS to engage with Chinese scientists conducting research in both traditional and Western medicine. He organized the PNIRS-China Committee and served as the Chair of that committee. The Chinese Government awarded him a grant that helped establish an active regional network of Chinese scientists/physicians conducting research in brain, behavior and immunity. In 2016, the PNIRS-China committee was installed as a standing committee, expanded and renamed as the PNIRS-Asia-Pacific committee. This committee has been quite successful in extending the global outreach of scientific symposia that was initiated by PNIRS-China to many Eastern countries in addition to China, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.  Research  Kelley's research has been focused on discovering interactions between the nervous and immune systems and their relationship between behavior and health. He was among the first scientists to combine immunology and neuroscience in integrative physiology. In 1976, when he completed his Ph.D., the immune system was considered only to protect against infectious diseases. He reshaped that view by applying immunological and neuroscience concepts to biomedical research. Owing to his research and contributions, it is now accepted by the scientific community at-large that there is an active dialogue between the immune system and brain. In his research, he used two approaches to prove the existence of important neuroendocrine-immune communication systems: substances from the brain and neuroendocrine system affect immune responses, and that products from an activated immune system affect the brain. These messengers are hormones and cytokines, respectively. = TNF Inhibition of Cell Function = In early 2000s, Kelley was asked to share his new concept of how TNF affects neurons and other cells for Trends in Neuroscience. In this article, Kelley explained how his group discovered that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF acts in a way that had never before been expected. Up until this time, the p55 receptor for TNF was best characterized by its ability to induce signals that directly trigger cell death. However, Kelley discovered that this is not the only way the TNF receptor inhibits a variety of cell functions. He developed strong evidence for a new concept by which the TNF receptor acts indirectly through the Silencing Of Survival Signals (SOSS). In this view, the TNF receptor acts to inhibit survival signals, such as phosphatidylinositol 3‚Äô-kinase (PI 3-kinase), that are activated by the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.Venters, H.D., R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2000. A new concept in neurodegeneration: TNF Œ± is a silencer of survival signals. Trends in Neurosciences 23:175-180. His group also showed that very low concentrations of TNF act similarly on breast cancer cells to inhibit their growth without killing the cells.Shen, W.H., Y. Yin, S.R. Broussard, R.H. McCusker, G.G. Freund, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2004. Tumor necrosis factor Œ± inhibits cyclin A expression and retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation triggered by insulin-like growth factor-I induction of new E2F-1 synthesis. J. Biological Chemistry 279:7438-7446. His group went on to establish that IL-1 as well as TNF impairs the ability of the growth-promoting peptide, insulin- like growth factor-I (IGF-I), to increase protein synthesis in progenitor muscle cells known as myoblasts.Broussard, S.R., R.H. McCusker, J.E. Novakofski, K. Strle, W.H. Shen, R.W. Johnson, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2004. IL-1ÔÅ¢ impairs insulin-like growth factor I-induced differentiation and downstream activation signals of the insulin-like I growth factor receptor in myoblasts. J. Immunology 172:7713-7720. Subsequent work in his laboratory supported this concept and enabled further characterization of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the paralyzing effects of TNF.O‚ÄôConnor, J.C., R.H. McCusker, K. Strle, R.W. Johnson, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2008. Regulation of IGF-I function by proinflammatory cytokines: At the interface of immunology and endocrinology. Cellular Immunology 252:91-110. This mechanism of intracellular cross-talk is likely to be the most pathophysiologically relevant action of TNF in vivo and is applicable to a broad number of receptors that are localized on the same cell. Kelley later presented evidence for the basic mechanism of TNF-induced resistance of the IGF receptor, which also explains why TNF inhibits the ability of myoblasts to grow and synthesize protein. = Role of IGF-I in survival and differentiation of cells of the immune system = In 1996, Kelley and his students showed that IGF-I is a survival factor for both hematopoietic cells and cerebellar granule neurons. Prior to their research, IGF-I was only known as a peptide that promotes the growth and development of muscle tissue in humans. Their discovery helped in the understanding how white blood cells live, die and develop into mature cells that actively defend the body against infectious diseases. Kelley and his team discovered that IGF-I acts by maintaining cellular expression of a survival protein known as Bcl-2, and this is accomplished by activating the key intracellular enzyme PI 3-kinase.Minshall, C., S. Arkins, R. Dantzer, G.G. Freund and K.W. Kelley. 1999. Phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase, but not S6-kinase, is required for insulin-like growth factor-I and IL-4 to maintain expression of Bcl-2 and promote survival of myeloid progenitors. J. Immunology 162:4542-4549. Differentiation of promyeloid cells into both neutrophils and macrophages is also promoted by IGF-I. Differentiaton of promyeloid cells in the presence of IGF-I causes phosphorylation of a key intracellular signaling molecule utilized by the IGF-I receptor, insulin receptor substrate-2 (formerly known as IL-4 phosphorylated substrate; 4PS), which allows for activation of further downstream pathways. Enhanced differentiation is associated with elevated expression of cyclin E, inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppression and suppression of the p27KIP1 inhibitor.Liu, Q., R.W. VanHoy, J.H. Zhou, R. Dantzer, G.G. Freund and K.W. Kelley. 1999. Elevated cyclin E levels, inactive retinoblastoma protein and suppression of the p27KIP1 inhibitor characterize early development of promyeloid cells into macrophages. Molecular and Cellular Biology 19:6229-6239. = Aging and decline of immune system function = In 1986, Kelley developed a model to study the regulation of immune function based on the fact that the ability of animals and humans to withstand infections declines as they age. He reasoned that the decline in immune function might be directly correlated with the decline in the production and release of pituitary-derived growth hormone. His findings, published that year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated for the first time that the shrunken and atrophic key lymphoid organ, the thymus, could be rejuvenated by growth hormone.Kelley, K.W., S. Brief, H.J. Westly, J. Novakofski, P.J. Bechtel, J. Simon and E.B. Walker. 1986. GH3 pituitary adenoma implants can reverse thymic aging. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:5663 5667. He subsequently showed that growth hormone overcomes a block in the development of T cells in the thymus gland of aged rats, allowing double negative immature thymocytes to complete growth and maturation.Kelley, K.W., D.R. Davila, S. Brief, J. Simon and S. Arkins. 1988. A pituitary thymus connection during aging. In W. Pierpaoli and N.H. Spector (Eds.) Neuroimmunomodulation: Interventions in Aging and Cancer. New York Academy of Sciences. New York, NY. 521:88 98. His early work with athymic nude mice in 1987 was used by the NIH to study T cell differentiation in mice with congenital defects in both T and B cell development.Davila, D.R., S. Brief, J. Simon, R.E. Hammer, R.L. Brinster and K.W. Kelley. 1987. Role of growth hormone in regulating T dependent immune events in aged, nude and transgenic rodents. J. Neuroscience Research 18:108 116. In the early 2000s, his research in this area showed that growth hormone reverses the loss of erythrocytic and myelocytic cells in the bone marrow of aged rats. This recovery is accompanied by a complete reversal of the accumulation of adipocytes in the bone marrow.French, R.A., S.R. Broussard, W.A. Meier, C. Minshall, S. Arkins, J.F. Zachary, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2002. Age-associated loss of bone marrow hematopoietic cells is reversed by GH and accompanies thymic reconstitution. Endocrinology 143:690-699. Growth hormone has now been shown to be beneficial in aged humans. NIH funded Kelley's research on aging, growth hormone and immunity, and the USDA funded Kelley's work for 9 consecutive years. In 1992, Kelley was asked to serve as a Special Editor for an entire, peer-reviewed issue of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (Vol. 6) that was dedicated to the topic of growth hormone, prolactin, IGF-I, and immunity. = Genes involved in neuroendocrine regulation of resistance to infectious disease = In 1991, Kelley and his colleagues published a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that demonstrated a critical role for the neuroendocrine system in protective immunity. His group demonstrated that in the absence of a pituitary gland, rats infected with Salmonella typhimurium die much more rapidly than their sham-operated controls with a hypophysis.Edwards, C.K., III., L.M. Yunger, R.M. Lorence, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 1991. The pituitary gland is required for protection against lethal effects of Salmonella typhimurium. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2274 2277. Further research by Kelley showed that growth hormone significantly improves survival of rats infected with S. typhimurium by increasing the bactericidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. In the late 1980s, Kelley's group showed that this occurs because growth hormone activates macrophages and neutrophils to produce superoxide anion.Kelley, K.W. 1989. Growth hormone, lymphocytes and macrophages. Biochemical Pharmacology 38:705 713. By using a panel of growth hormone variants created by site-directed mutagenesis, Kelley and his colleagues at Genentech showed that human neutrophils use the prolactin rather than the growth hormone receptor to prime phagocytes for free oxygen radical secretion.Fu, Y.K., S. Arkins, G. Fuh, B.C. Cunningham, J.A. Wells, S. Fong, M.J. Cronin, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 1992. Growth hormone augments superoxide anion secretion of human neutrophils by binding to the prolactin receptor. The Journal of Clinical Investigation 89:451 457. = Molecular basis for neural-immune system interactions= Kelley was the first to use a molecular approach to show that a classical pituitary hormone, pro- opiomelanocortin, is actually synthesized by leukocytes.Westly, H.J., A.J. Kleiss, K.W. Kelley, P.K.Y. Wong and P. H. Yuen. 1986. Newcastle disease virus infected splenocytes express the pro-opiomelanocortin gene. J. Exp. Med. 163:1589-1594. In the early 1990s, he expanded these findings with colleagues at Ohio State University to show that leukocytes also synthesize prolactin and IGF-I. Kelley's data helped form the basis for the idea that leukocytes may serve as a sixth sense for humans because they possess the receptors that are needed to recognize pathogens. In 1992, together with his French colleagues, he offered substantial support for this idea by showing that a cytokine produced after a peripheral infection, IL-1, induces a substantial reduction in the motivation of rats to eat. This reduction was inhibited by administration of an antagonist of the IL-1 receptor directly into the lateral ventricle of the brain. This was the first demonstration that cytokines from the periphery induce sickness behavior by acting in the brain.Kent, S., R.M. Bluth√©, R. Dantzer, A.J. Hardwick, K.W. Kelley, N.J. Rothwell and J.L. Vannice. 1992. Different receptor mechanisms mediate the pyrogenic and behavioral effects of interleukin 1. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:9117-9120. Kelley used these data to strongly advance the concept of communication networks between the brain and the immune system. This paper, which was the first to provide unequivocal data that advanced the concept of sickness behavior, is now considered a classic, paradigm-shifting contribution by many experts in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. By helping the Bordeaux group to implement molecular biology techniques for the study of expression of cytokines and their receptors in the brain, he was instrumental for providing the formal proof that specific receptors for both forms of the IL-1 receptor are expressed in the pituitary and in the brain. These experiments paved the way for double-labeling, immunohistochemistry experiments showing that both isoforms of the IL-1 receptor are expressed only on pituitary cells that synthesize growth hormone as well as in the brain. One of these photomicrographs was selected for the September, 1996 cover page of Endocrinology.French, R.A., J.F. Zachary, R. Dantzer, L.S. Frawley, R. Chizzonite, P. Parnet and K.W. Kelley. 1996. Dual expression of p80 type I and p68 type II interleukin-1 receptors on anterior pituitary cells synthesizing growth hormone. Endocrinology 137:4027-4036. Kelley's subsequent research in this area addressed the role of IL-10 in life and death signals of microglia.Strle, K., J.H. Zhou, W.H. Shen, S.R. Broussard, R.W. Johnson, G.G. Freund, R. Dantzer and K.W. Kelley. 2001. Interleukin-10 in the brain. Critical Reviews in Immunology 21:427-449. = Connection between disease, sickness and depression = In the 2000s, Kelley and his research team studied how sickness behaviorKelley, K.W., R.M. Bluth√©, R. Dantzer, J.H. Zhou, W.H. Shen, R.W. Johnson and S.R. Broussard. 2003. Cytokine-induced sickness behavior. Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 17:S112-S118. can develop into depressive-like behavior. He and his team utilized an infectious disease model using Bacillus Calmette‚ÄìGu√©rin (BCG), a mycobacteria that is a potent inducer of interferon (IFN)-gamma. Using this model, they found both BCG and IFN-gamma activate an enzyme in the brain, known as indole 2,3-dioxygenase, that catabolizes tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway rather than serotonin.O‚ÄôConnor, J.C., M.A. Lawson, C. Andr√©, E.M. Briley, S.S. Szegedi, et al. 2009. Induction of IDO by Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin is responsible for development of murine depressive-like behavior. J. Immunology 182:3202-3212. They found that in response to a peripheral infection, innate immune cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on the brain to cause sickness behavior. When activation of the peripheral immune system continues unabated, such as during systemic infections, cancer or autoimmune diseases, the ensuing immune signaling to the brain can lead to an exacerbation of sickness and the development of symptoms of depression in vulnerable individuals.Dantzer, R., J.C.

The epicentre was located 214 km from Bandar Lampung, the capital of Lampung and 147 km west of Sumur, Pandeglang Regency. The earthquake struck with a maximum intensity of V (Moderate). The earthquake prompted a tsunami warning in the area, with authorities urging coastal residents to immediately evacuate to higher grounds. The earthquake was the largest earthquake to have hit Jakarta and West Java since 2009, when a magnitude 7.0 struck Java killing 79 people. In the aftermath, the earthquake damaged a total of 505 structures across Banten and West Java. The earthquake caused 8 deaths, 8 injuries and displaced a total of 33 people. All of the deaths were indirectly caused by the earthquake.  Earthquake  The earthquake struck at 19:03 local time (12:03 UTC) at a moderate depth of 52.8 km (Indonesian BMKG stated that the earthquake struck at a depth of 10 km). The epicentre was located 147 km off the coast of Sumur, an area which had been previously destroyed by another tsunami in December 2018. Indonesian geological agency BMKG recorded the magnitude of the earthquake as 7.4 while the USGS recorded it as a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. BMKG subsequently revised the magnitude to 6.9 and its hypocentre to 48 km. The earthquake struck with an oblique-slip motion. According to experts from the Indonesian BMKG, the earthquake wasn't caused by Sunda megathrust, but rather from a nearby fault, indicated by its north-south motion of the rupture. It was later confirmed that the earthquake was an intraplate earthquake. = Intensity = Moderate shaking were widely reported across Lampung, Banten and West Java. In Jakarta, office workers and apartment residents were evacuated from high rise buildings, citing \\"strong shaking\\". The operation of Jakarta MRT was terminated due to the earthquake. The earthquake could be felt as far away as Mataram, which was located in Lombok Island. In Yogyakarta, residents reported \\"swaying motion\\" from the earthquake. The recorded maximum Mercalli-intensity of the earthquake was VI (strong). The maximum perceived intensity, however, was V (moderate). = Tsunami = A tsunami warning was issued for Lampung and Banten, with an expected maximum height of 3 m. Residents in coastal areas, especially those in Southern Lampung and Pandeglang Regency, were urged by authorities to evacuate to higher grounds. In Lampung, at least 1,050 people evacuated to the governor's office. Initially, there were unconfirmed reports that water levels had receded in several areas in Banten. These reports were considered as hoaxes as observation of tide gauges showed that there were no observed changes in water levels around Banten and Lampung. Nearly one and a half-hour after the warning was issued, it was cancelled by Indonesian BMKG.  Casualties  On 3 August, the Indonesian Government confirmed that 2 people had died during the evacuation, one of whom reportedly died due to heart attack. On 4 August, the death toll later rose to 5 and then stood at 6, specifically 1 in Pandeglang Regency, 3 in Lebak Regency and 2 in Sukabumi Regency. All of the deaths were indirectly caused by the earthquake and none were caused by fallen debris. Additionally, 3 injuries were reported and 33 people were displaced by the earthquake. Finally, on 5 August, a number of eight casualties was confirmed.  Damage  Since most of the buildings located in the region are vulnerable and don't meet with the current criteria for an earthquake-resistant building, significant damages were widely reported across the region. Most of the buildings in the region are considered as unreinforced masonry building. Preliminary reports showed that dozens of structures across Banten and West Java had been either damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. On 3 August, hours after the quake, reports indicated that 21 houses and 1 mosque had been damaged. The number later rose to 200. Cracks were found in several homes in Bandung, the capital of West Java. A total of 7 homes were damaged in Bogor.Pandeglang's Regional Disaster Management Board stated that 42 homes were damaged in Pandeglang, particularly in Mandalawangi. A total of 505 structures, including schools, mosques and public institution, were damaged in the quake. Traditional Baduy settlements with vernacular buildings reported little to no damage The Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, however, stated that no infrastructures had been damaged in the quake.  Response  The Indonesian Ministry of Health stated that the Central Government's medical department will not help with the handling of the healthcare for the survivors, stating that the regional government is 'adequate enough' to handle. The Ministry of Social Affairs stated that it had dispatched personnel of Tagana (Taruna Siaga Bencana) to the affected areas. The ministry stated that those who perished in the quake would be compensated with Rp 15 million each.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. As of 2019, the building was being redeveloped into mixed use commercial space. History Battle Creek was a major center for printing in the late 19th century, with the Seventh-day Adventist Church publishing house located in the city, as well as smaller printing services. With the rise of the cereal industry in Battle Creek, including Kellogg's and Postum Cereal Company, several of the printers established lines to print cereal boxes. One of those was Eugene Cole, who in 1902 reorganized his newspaper publishing company as the Record Printing & Box Company. The company immediately constructed a new factory on Carlyle, and was soon employing 150 people and running presses 22 hours a day to keep up with demand. However, in 1905, Cole resigned due to ill health and the Record Printing and Box Company went into receivership. Although the business continued, in 1907 the plant boiler exploded, resulting in substantial damage. The Record Printing and Box Company was sold to board member W.I. Fell, who relocated the printing equipment to another building and reorganized the company into the Michigan Carton Company. A portion of the now-vacant Carlyle plant was rented out to the W. H. Eldred's Wholesale Saddlery, a maker of fine leather goods. The business thrived, although the rise of the automobile slowly reduced demand for its products. Eldred temporarily retired in 1915, but reopened at the start of World War I to produce goods for the war. After the war, he shuttered the business permanently in 1919. In 1916, the Alsteel Manufacturing Company joined Elred as a tenant in the building, and in 1919 took over the entire structure. Alsteel manufactures a paper baler, meant to compress flammable waste materials and reduce fire risk. The company expanded to produce a range of steel products, including wire baskets, lawn-sprinklers, vegetable slicers, and hose clamps. Alsteel remained in the facility until 1952, when they moved to a larger building. Afterward, the Record Printing and Box Company Building was used as a warehouse and sales office for Hermann Typewriter Service. In 1968, the company was purchased by Fred Crandal and renamed Officeways. Crandal retired in 2000 and donated the building to the Battle Creek Community Foundation. The now-vacant building was sold to the City of Battle Creek in 2003. Redevelopment was planned, but did not come to fruition until 2017, when the building was purchased by Restore (269), a local development company. As of 2019, the company was redeveloping the building as a mixed-use space, housing a brewery and taproom on the first floor, a technology office and shared work space on the second floor, and an event space on the third floor. Description The Record Printing and Box Company Building is a three-story brick timber-framed building with a flat roof, typical of manufacturing plants built at the turn of the century. The external brick is brown. Window openings are arched or flat with keystones. The main entrance is through a double door located in an arched brick opening with semicircle glass window above Brick cornices run atop the building along the street facades.

Francis Hermann (born c. 1856- after 1896) was an English-born American pastor, murderer and suspected serial killer. After being connected to the murder of two female church-goers in Salt Lake City, Utah, Hermann fled the city and was never seen again. He is also suspected of murdering ex-wives and two of his children. Early life and move to America Francis Hermann was born in England to immigrant parents of either Norwegian or Danish origin. Little is known about his years in his native country. What is known is that Hermann was very well-educated in England, and even married at some point, but his wife died under strange circumstances. Hermann moved to the U.S. in 1891, first settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota and marrying Bertha Wagner. However, Bertha was mentally unstable and was set to be moved into an asylum. Curiously, hours before her departure, she also died under mysterious circumstances, but no action was taken to investigate further. A year later, Hermann wooed and married a Miss Lowen of Iowa, with their wedding ceremony being performed in Minneapolis. By this time, he had moved to Superior, Wisconsin, where he had become the pastor of the First Norwegian-Danish Methodist Episcopal Church. Hermann was a respected figure in Scandinavian social circles, and was even a central figure in the Ministers' Association. He and his wife lived in Superior until the fall of 1893, when they decided to relocate to Salt Lake City, Utah. Shortly after their arrival, a baby was born, but both it and the mother died under suspicious circumstances as well. Murders =Henrietta Clawson= Contemporary sketch of Clawson A native of Sweden, Clawson (or Clauson/Clausen) first arrived through Denmark in 1887. Having no relatives in the U.S., she settled in with a family named Johnson in Omaha, Nebraska. However, due to an illness, Clawson was brought over to Salt Lake City by Tillie Anderson. Anderson later returned to Omaha, but Clawson decided to remain, maintaining contact with her friends back in Nebraska through letters. Soon after Hermann arrived in Salt Lake City, her letters frequently contained allusions of their great friendship. In September 1895, while Hermann was attending a church conference in the east, the 25-year-old Clawson was hired to look after his parsonage in the church. When he returned, business went on as usual until a few days later, when Clawson remarked to Mrs. H. H. Peterson that she was going to visit a Mrs. Hanson on Center Street. She also added that she would return in the evening and attend services, before leaving the following day to visit a female acquaintance in the country. However, that was the last time anybody saw Clawson. Clawson's friends made several inquiries of her whereabouts to the church, and some to Hermann himself, to no avail. The case was highly unusual, as Clawson often contacted them through letters. To their surprise, Hermann wrote them a letter claiming that he had solved the mystery: he had seen Mrs. Clawson in a brothel in Butte, Montana. The supposed murder weapons Strangely enough, the church's janitor, Mr. Johnson, recalled that on the day after Clawson's disappearance, Hermann asked of him to clear the pipes of the basement furnace and prepare it for a fire. The old furnace hadn't been used since a big fire it had caused years previously, but the pastor told Johnson he needed to check the pipes. Johnson followed the instructions, and when he was about to start the fire, he was stopped by Hermann, who told him that he wanted to attend to the matter by himself. During the night, Ed Johnson, a young worker who occupied a room upstairs, was overcome by the intense heat and a putrid stench coming from the furnace. He fell into an unconscious state, and had to be splashed with water in order to come back to his senses. His parents complained to Hermann about the fire, but he continued with it until 6 o'clock in the evening, when it was finally put out. Sketch of the murder scene Pieces of clothing from Clawson The incident was soon forgotten, and Hermann suddenly left two weeks after, claiming that he had to visit a religious conference in the east. He called upon a friend from Provo to replace him for the services, but the young man, who was an associate of Clawson, decided to check out the mouldy basement. To his surprise, in the furnace he found several interesting items under the grate in the ash receiver: two razors, an English-made butcher knife which Hermann kept in his kitchen, a garter buckle, a belt buckle and, most shockingly, human bones. Upon further examination, he noticed that there was blood on the furnace door, and the buckles were from Clawson's clothing. Other pieces of clothing from Clawson Authorities were summoned, and while the bones were sent in for an examination, they also found empty charcoal sacks. Mrs. Peterson, an acquiatance of both Hermann and Clawson, remarked that she had been Hermann carrying a large sack down to the basement, but didn't know what it contained. She also alleged that Hermann himself had told her that Clawson had made a marriage proposal to him. Further inquiries revealed that there were two artificial teeth with metallic rivets among the ashes and that Clawson had six artificial teeth similar to the ones found. An examination by a dentist named Keyser proved the connection. Perhaps even more curiously, a trunk belonging to Clawson was found in a pawn shop, which Hermann claimed he had mailed to her by an unknown expressman. In the trunk, articles of Clawson's clothing were discovered. Not only that, it turned out that Hermann had sold the trunk himself, despite secretly receiving money amounting to $300 from the woman, presumably for safekeeping and investment. Since Hermann was known to drink heavily, as he kept various liquors in his study, it is possible that he had spent it on alcohol. On another note, shortly before his departure, the pastor had admitted to embezzling church funds, and was awaiting a verdict from the church. =Annie Samuelson= Not long after the discovery of Clawson's charred remains, Hermann was also implicated in the disappearance and likely death of Annie K. Samuelson. In contrast to Clawson, Samuelson was employed as a nursery governess in a good family, and had an aunt and other relatives in Salt Lake City. A member of Hermann's church, she left her position to work as his housekeeper, under the promise of marrying the pastor. On February 28, 1896, Samuelson told her friends that she was going to Ogden in order to marry Hermann on the following day. However, on the next morning, Hermann was in town as usual, and when inquired about Samuelson's whereabouts by John Hansen, a fellow church-goer, he told the elderly man that she was still in Ogden and did not know when she would return. Samuelson, in fact, never did return. Sketch of the church A few days after the discovery of Clawson's murder, a gold ring and watch belonging to Samuelson were found in a pawnbroker's shop, placed by Hermann shortly before his departure to Kansas City, Missouri. Further developments indicated that the pair were criminally intimate, as not only had Samuelson made several payments for Hermann while they were living together, she had also let him perform an abortion on her in January. Although it is not entirely clear how Samuelson was killed, taking into account that Hermann was heavily interested in the human anatomy and dissection, and that a box of poisonous drugs was found in his room, it is very likely that he poisoned, butchered and subsequently dismembered Samuelson's body in the church basement before disposing of the remains. Authorities noted that a few days prior to Samuelson's disappearance, the pastor had a large box made at a nearby lumber yard. They held to the theory that he stored her remains there, and shipped them off with him to Kansas City. Despite police searching the church grounds and digging out numerous bones, some of them human, none of the remains were positively identified as those of Samuelson. Alas, Hermann's guilt was definitely proven in her murder by two separate letters, written on behalf of Rev. Ellefson and Presiding Elder Mork. In the first case, on May 6, Hermann visited Ellefsons and gave his wife some clothes, claiming they belonged to Hermann's deceased wife. On closer inspection, some of the garments bore the initials \\"A. K. S.\\" - those of Annie K. Samuelson. The same case was for Mork, of Brigham City, whose wife also found the same initials. In addition, Rev. Melby from Butte sent a letter in which he noted that Hermann had actually sold a trunk and a quantity of ladies' clothing while in Montana. =Suspected victims= Aside from killing Clawson and Samuelson, Francis Hermann was also suspected in the deaths of several ex-wives and two of his children: * First wife (England) - Died under suspicious circumstances on an unknown date. No other information is available about her death. * Bertha Wagner and child (Minneapolis, Minnesota) - Married by Hermann after his arrival in 1891. Wagner was determined to be insane, and was about to be shipped off to an asylum when she and her child died mysteriously. * Caroline Crowley (Minneapolis, Minnesota) - Mysteriously disappeared in the spring of 1892. Her sister, Clara, declared that it was most likely Hermann who murdered her, as although he was repulsed by her, he had attempted to marry her nonetheless. * Miss Lowen and child (Salt Lake City, Utah) - Married in Minneapolis, and resided with her in Superior, Wisconsin until 1893. Shortly after, a child was born to the couple, but both it and the mother died under suspicious circumstances. Escape and sightings Not long after both Clawson and Samuelson disappeared, Hermann left Salt Lake City on May 7, his supposed destination being Kansas City, from where he would go on a religious tour to Decorah, Iowa. However, authorities from both cities were unable to locate Hermann, and a reward was announced for his immediate arrest. He was positively traced to a metro in St. Louis, and it was suggested that he was hiding out either in Cincinnati, Ohio or a small town near Indianapolis, Indiana, disguised as a florist. Over the following year, several people were arrested on suspicion of being Hermann, but were later released when it was proven false. There are no reports concerning Hermann after 1897, and it is presumed that he escaped capture. * D. M. Elmenberg - On June 1, 1896, George M. Nolan, reported to be either the employee of a Salt Lake City liquor house, or a California wine company, claimed to have travelled along with Hermann two days prior off the Oregon short line, and that the murderer was hiding out in Idaho. Nolan was absolutely positive the man was the pastor, but refused to give any particulars, as he wanted the $500 prize for himself. He was accompanied by Capt. Donovan and Det. Jenney to St. Anthony, where they found the man. He was actually found to be D. M. Elmenberg, a San Francisco native who bore a striking resemblance to Hermann. * Rev. J. Orris Brown - On June 5, the Rev. J. Orris Brown was arrested in Tennessee on suspicion of being Hermann. He was first detained in Chattanooga and extradited to Cleveland, where it is last reported that he was waiting for a picture of Hermann to arrive in order for identification procedures to continue. No other reports for him exist, suggesting he was released. * Rev. G. Wynne Richmond - In Topeka, Kansas, Richmond was arrested and was awaiting trial for sending obscene material through the mail. He was accused of being Hermann, which he denied vehemently, and was proven that they are not the same person. * Unnamed man - In July 1897, a man was arrested in Pembroke, Ontario, Canada on suspicion of being Hermann. A detective from Salt Lake City was sent out to confirm his identity, but ended up exonerating the man, saying that a mistake had been made. See also * Theodore Durrant * H. H.

Described by Frederick Lillywhite as a \\"brilliant bat, forward in style, combining splendid hitting, with careful defence\\", Bull made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Southgate at Oxford in 1863. He made two further first-class appearances for Oxford in 1863.

The following season he made four first-class appearances, playing one match each for the MCC, the Gentlemen of England, R. D. Walker's XI and Southgate. His final appearance in first-class cricket came ten years later in 1876, for the MCC against Oxford University. Across 21 first-class matches, Bull scored a total of 494 runs at an average of 14.11, with a high score of 46.

He is professor of primary care diagnostics at the University of Exeter. He specialises in primary care diagnostics, with particular expertise in cancer.  Early life and education  Hamilton was born in 1958 in Belfast Northern Ireland. He moved to study Medicine at the University of Bristol, qualifying in 1982, having added an intercalated degree in Medical Microbiology in 1979. Following this, general medical training and 2.5 years as a physician in Malawi, he trained to become a general practitioner in 1989. Hamilton became a member of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) of the United Kingdom in 1986 and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in 1989. In 2001, Hamilton was forced to take a break from his career in general practice due to an infected cochlear implant and began full-time research. He was awarded Fellowship of the RCGP in 2002 and a year later, in 2003, received Fellowship of the RCP. He also received a Doctor of Medicine degree in 2005 with his thesis title of ‚ÄòEarlier diagnosis of colorectal, lung and prostate cancer‚Äô.  Career and scholarly positions  In 1990, Hamilton moved to Exeter to pursue a career as a GP, joining Barnfield Hill Surgery. He practised here for 10 years, when he took a break from working when his cochlear implant became infected, leaving him with insufficient hearing to practice medicine safely. During the enforced break he obtained a NIHR doctoral fellowship, plus a RCGP fellowship, allowing him to study full-time for his MD at University of Bristol. A year later, in 2007, Hamilton was appointed as a Consultant Senior Lecturer in the Department of Community Based Medicine at the University of Bristol. Hamilton became Chief Medical Officer for Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society in 2000 and for The Exeter in 2003, both mutual insurance companies. He later became Executive Director of The Exeter, a post he still holds. He returned to practice as a GP in 2006 at Mount Pleasant Health Centre in Exeter after successful re-implantation. In 2010, Hamilton took up his current role as professor of primary care diagnostics at the University of Exeter Medical School. Since then he has been responsible for leading research into creating resources for GPs to identify patients who may he suffering from each of the 19 main cancers, using their symptoms. He was also clinical lead of the NICE, ‚ÄòReferral for Suspected Cancer‚Äô NG12, published in 2015. 100 of the 210 recommendations in this guidance can be linked back to Hamilton‚Äôs research. Hamilton also created the cancer ‚ÄòRisk Assessment Tools‚Äô or ‚ÄòRATs‚Äô for short. This research identified and quantified the risk of symptoms that were linked to 15 different cancers . This included the discovery that a sore throat is a feature of larynx cancer . Risk Assessment Tools have been part of the effort to increase diagnosis of cancer in the UK A study in BJGP has concluded that the uptake of Risk Assessment Tools have been shown that these aren‚Äôt being used as much as initially anticipated, however, a large study is due to take shape during the second half of 2019 with the aim that there will be a new uptake of these tools to diagnose cancer Through the course of his career, Hamilton has published over 250 papers.. He has won RCGP Research paper of the year overall twice and has received more than 40 research grants, totalling over ¬£20m CBE For his work towards cancer diagnosis, Hamilton was awarded a CBE in the 2019 New Year‚Äôs Honours List. He collected his award at Buckingham Palace 7 March 2019. Personal Life =Northern Ireland= Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland, he has competed in two different disciplines for his country. During the 1970s and 1980s, Hamilton fenced internationally for Northern Ireland. More recently, he competed in Bridge for Northern Ireland, alongside his brother Ian in the Camrose Trophy. They were selected to represent Northern Ireland on two occasions in 2010 and 2011 with England and Wales winning in respective years. =Hearing= During his teens, Hamilton started losing his hearing and was profoundly deaf by the age of 30, after which he wore hearing aids for a number of years. As his hearing deteriorated, he learnt to lip read to be able to continue his work as a GP. He was offered a cochlear implant in 2000, which became infected and he had to take a break from his career. At the third time of asking, in 2016, he had a successful cochlear implant. This has meant that he is now able to hear clearly for the first time in a number of years.

It now houses a museum of ancient mosaics and other archaeological findings from the Palestinian territories, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is sometimes confused with the nearby Khan al-Ahmar (\\"Red Caravaserai\\"), as the Good Samaritan Inn was sometimes also called by this name. Christian tradition According to the Christian tradition, the site may have been the location of the event of the \\"Parable of the Good Samaritan\\" in the Gospel of Luke (, specifically ). The association is made already by Jerome in 385 and continued through the centuries, the British Mandate authorities adopting the name Good Samaritan Inn for the site. There are few inns located between Jerusalem and Jericho, and Khan al-Hatruri is a plausible fit for the location of the story. After 1967 Israel developed the ruins as a tourist site officially called the \\"Good Samaritan Inn\\". However, the identification as the \\"inn of the good Samaritan\\" is neither of Byzantine, nor of Crusader date, when pilgrims saw in the blood-coloured rocks rather the symbolic proof that this was the place where the traveller in the parable was beaten by the robbers. History =Israelites= The Iron Age Israelites called this area Maale Adumim, \\"Red Ascent\\" (), due to the red rocks seen here, and it was part of their road between Jerusalem and Jericho. =Late Roman and Byzantine periods= Eusebius, writing before 324 CE, mentions the Late Roman fort of Maledomni, whose traces have disappeared under the Templar castle of Maldoim. The fort was already standing by 331, and around 400 it was garrisoned by Cohors I Salutaris, a Roman auxiliary unit commissioned with protecting the travellers. Under the protection of the fortified place, a caravanserai was established. In 385, St Jerome accompanied his benefactress, the Roman patrician Paula, on her pilgrimage to Jericho, and at this site recalled the parable of the merciful Samaritan, seemingly hinting at the existence there of a church and road station. He introduces the interpretation that the name Adummim, derived from the Semitic root for blood and the colour red, stems from the blood shed there by the victims of road robbers, an idea later picked up by medieval authors. In the Early Byzantine period there seems to have been a fortress at the site (4th-5th century), replaced in the 6th century by a square-shaped inn, erected around a central courtyard, providing Christian pilgrims with rooms, water from a central cistern, and a large church for worship. =Crusader period= The Templar castle of Maldoim (also Maledoim, Adumim, Castrum Dumi, Turris Rubea, Rubea Cisterna, Rouge Cisterne)Pringle (1998), The Churches... volume II, p.454 preserves the Israelite Hebrew name, Maale Adumim. The castle is mentioned by Theoderic in 1172. Its ruins stand at the hilltop dominating the khan, although now it is separated from it by the modern highway). The protection offered by the castle had as a result the establishment of an inn, a remote precursor of the buildings we are seeing today. =Ayyubid and Mamluk periods= After the Battle of Hattin in 1187, the castle, already deserted by the Knights Templar, was occupied by Saladin's troops. A French author, writing around 1230, identifies the khan as the inn where \\"the Samaritan carried the man\\". Later medieval authors start making a distinction between the khan and the castle. Felix Fabri wrote, after his 1483‚Äì84 pilgrimage to the Holy Land, about the ruined inn of which only the dangerously weathered four walls were still standing around a small well, a rare and important landmark along the steep ascent in an arid landscape.Pringle (1998), The Churches... volume II, p.454 =Ottoman period= In 1767 Giovanni Mariti, a man of culture but not so much of faith, Bombardieri, Luca.

Abstract. writes of the ruin on the hill that it \\"is called Castle of the Samaritan, after the nearby khan...\\". The Palestine Exploration Fund studied the site in 1873 and reported on the ruins of the inn: > \\"Khan Hathrurah ‚Äî A Saracen hostel, standing on high ground, and just north > of the present Jericho road. A few piers and some of the walls are still > standing. On the opposite side of the road are two or three small caves, in > one of which is a stone with an Arabic inscription. Cisterns, well-built and > supported on arches, exist beneath the Khan, and contain water. North-east > of this, on the highest part of the hill, are the remains of a strong > fortress, which commands the road here, ascending through a narrow pass > between walls of rock on the east. On the west also there is a winding > ascent to the neighborhood of the Khan. The rock, especially on the west, is > of a ruddy color like burnt brick, whence the title, Tal'at ed Damm, 'Ascent > of Blood ', is applied to the whole hill, and sometimes to the castle on the > summit\\". The khan was rebuilt in its present shape in 1903. The Good Samaritan Museum of Mosaics In 2010, a Museum of Mosaics was opened at the site. It was initiated by Yitzhak Magen, the Staff Officer for Archaeology at the Israeli Civil Administration for the West Bank. Magen discovered that the site had been rebuilt in several historical periods, and in every phase the site had apparently functioned as an inn for travellers. In the Byzantine period a church was also built at the site, suggesting its importance for early Christian pilgrims. The floor of the church was once decorated by a beautiful mosaic of geometric patterns that had largely disappeared in modern times. Magen decided that he and his team would restore the mosaic based on early photographs taken before the tiles had disappeared. After the successful restoration of the church's mosaic floor, it was decided to take the project further and create a mosaic museum there. The museum contains mosaic floors excavated all across the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with a wing dedicated to the history and customs of the Samaritans.The website of the \\"Good Samaritan Museum\\"The Good Samaritan Inn Mosaic Museum - Israel Nature and Parks Authority References Bibliography * (pp. 172, 207‚àí209) * (grid 1841/1361) (pp. 78‚àí79) * (grid 1841/1386) (pp. 345‚àí 346, 454) See also *Wadi Qelt - the ancient road from Jericho to Jerusalem followed the Ascent of Adummim, along the southern side of Wadi Qelt, past the khan, and on to the Olive Mount ridgeBolen, Todd.

Signs and symptoms Biosynthesis and breakdown of serotonin and the catecholamines, and the metabolic block in AADC deficiency, Wassenberg et al., 2017. Babies with severe AADC deficiency usually present during the first few months of life. Symptoms can include: * Hypotonia (floppiness) * Developmental delay * Oculogyric crises * Difficulty with initiating and controlling movements * Dystonia and dyskinesia * Gastointestinal dysmotility which can present at as vomiting, gastro-oesophageal reflux, diarrhoea and/or constipation * Autonomic symptoms including difficulties controlling temperature and blood sugar, excessive sweating and nasal congestion Some patients may develop cerebral folate deficiency, because O-methylation of the excessive amounts of L-Dopa can deplete methyl donors such as SAM and 5-MTHF. This deviation can be detected by measuring the levels of 5-MTHF in the cerebrospinal fluid, and can be corrected by folinic acid. Genetics AADC deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance AADC deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning an individual needs to have two faulty copies of the DDC gene in order to be affected. Usually, one copy is inherited from each parent. Pathophysiology The AADC enzyme is involved in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin, both of which are important neurotransmitters. Diagnosis Once there is a clinical suspicion of the diagnosis, neurotransmitters can be analysed in cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture. If these show the pattern of abnormalities typical for AADC deficiency, the diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing and/or measurement of enzyme activity. Treatment There is currently no cure for AADC deficiency, but medical and multidisciplinary treatment can relieve some of the symptoms. Patients will require physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy. Some will need enteral feeding (for example, a gastrostomy or jejunostomy) due to difficulties with chewing and swallowing. Various medications can help compensate for the missing neurotransmitters. Dopamine agonists such as rotigotine or pramipexole and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as selegiline are commonly used. Patients may also need to take a range of other medications to control dyskinesia, constipation and other symptoms.

He succeeded his father as Baron Talbot in 1396 when still a minor and was therefore made a ward of the King until 1403. Form 1403 he was in the service of the Prince of Wales guarding the Welsh Border and with his company of esquires and archers defeated a superior Welsh force at Grosmont, Monmouthshire, in 1404. He was summoned to the House of Lords from 1407 and invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1408/09.

He succeeded to his mother's title in 1413, becoming 8th Baron Strange of Blakemere and was appointed Chief Justice of Chester in 1413. He served on a number of commissions and, whilst waiting at Southampton in 1415 to follow Henry V on his French campaign, took part in the trials of the traitors Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and Lord Scrope for their part in the Southampton Plot. Once in France he took part in the siege of Caen (1417) and was made Captain-general of the Normandy Marches.

His special significance lies in the field of constructive art. He is counted among the first artists who did not work figuratively. In the course of his life he produced hundreds of oil paintings, a large number of drawings as well as approximately 2000 to 3000 watercolor and gouache paintings.  Biography  Andr√© Evard was born on 1st June 1876 in Renan (Bernese Jura) as the son of Jean-F√©lix Evard (1849-1879) and Marie Sagne (1852-1921). After the early death of his father, he and his mother moved to La Chaux-de-Fonds, where Marie Evard ran a pastry shop. Initially working as a pastry chef, Andr√© received an inheritance which enabled him to study art. He studied at the √âcole d'Art in La Chaux-de-Fonds from 1905 to 1909 and attended courses in decorative art with Charles L'Eplattenier, a former student of Ferdinand Hodler. Through L'Eplattenier, La Chaux-de-Fonds became a centre of Art nouveau in Switzerland. He was particularly interested in the nature of the Jura and encouraged his pupils to \\"[...] study the nature of the Jura - from the fir trees to the tectonics of the limestone cliffs - analyse their regularities and translate them into abstract ornaments\\" (in German: } Here Andr√© Evard distinguished himself above all in the goldsmith and enamel art with the finest works, which is why the art critic Jean-Marie Nussbaum labeled him a jeweller of painting. At that time Evard was artistically still strongly influenced by Art nouveau. Among his friends at university were Le Corbusier, Conrad Meili and L√©on Perrin, with whom he decorated and painted private villas. With Le Corbusier, for example, he furnished the interiors of the Villa Fallet in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Around 1900 Evard got in touch with Paul Pettavel, a priest in La Chaux-de-Fonds who published a free Sunday newspaper, \\"La Feuille du dimanche\\", in which he propagated social reformist and pacifist ideas. The weekly also focused on the fight against alcoholism. La Chaux-de- Fonds was then a centre of international pacifism. Evard became a member of the Christian Youth Association of the pastor and administered the publication of the weekly newspaper for almost 30 years. Through his activities at Pettavel he got to know the painter , whose daughter he married in 1928. Around the year 1907 Evard shifted his artistic interest almost completely to painting and drawing and in the same year undertook a longer study trip to Italy, where he studied the old Masters. Above all, small-format portraits and atmospheric landscapes were the main characteristics of the works of the following years. His first collages were made in 1908, but they met with strong rejection. The participation in various exhibitions, such as 1909 in Munich or 1914 in Neuch√¢tel, did not lead to any success either. The result was a deep creative crisis and a complete reorientation. Thus from 1913 he undertook the first non-objective, cubist and constructive attempts, which were ultimately to place him in the front rank not only of the Swiss avant- garde. More and more he devoted himself to the principle of the series (an example of this is the painting series Roses), because he was fascinated by the variations of a basic motif and its color variations. From 1912 until the end of World War I, Andr√© Evard used the name \\"Louvrier\\" as a pseudonym. After the death of his mother longer stays in Paris followed from 1923 to 1927, during which he again dealt intensively with the old and modern masters and got to know artists like Georges Braque, Robert Delaunay and Theo van Doesburg, who tried in vain to win him for cooperation in the 'De Stijl' group In addition, he came into contact with African sculpture for the first time, which increased his interest in non-European art. Since then he has attached particular importance to black ‚Äì for him the aristocrat of colors. Some of his abstract, cubist and constructive works created during these Parisian years were exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendents and the Salon d'Automne. Although Andr√© Evard was now at the center of the avant-garde, he responded to requests from the art trade by rejecting them and almost never gave his works to galleries or collectors. He sought recognition almost exclusively in the context of official institutions. Back in La Chaux de Fonds, he married Milca Reguin, the daughter of the painter Louis Reguin in 1928. The following year was a huge one: Due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 he lost his entire fortune. Until the end of his life he now lived in modest circumstances. It was no longer possible to travel to Paris. His sphere of influence was thus limited to his homeland, which he had never left since. Moreover, his avant- garde works were not in demand among conservative audiences. At first he resignedly stopped his production, but from 1932 he changed his style in order to increase the chances of a sale. In addition to other Concrete works, a multitude of traditionally figurative, almost deserted landscapes and still lifes were created, characterized by strong colors: \\"La Chaux-de-Fonds lies at around 1,000 metres above sea level and is therefore one of the highest cities in Europe. From this altitude, Evard was particularly fascinated by the spectacle of light during sunrises and sunsets. The steep valley flanks (C√¥tes du Doubs) are densely wooded and partly crossed by rocky outcrops\\" (in German: } Evard participated in various exhibitions, such as the 1936 exhibition 'Zeitprobleme in der Schweizer Malerei und Plastik' at the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich. In 1937 he also joined the newly founded group Allianz as member no. 10, which offered a platform to avant-garde artists and in which important representatives of abstract and surrealist art participated. But here, too, he did not make use of the advantages of the group, which also met with little public interest in his home country. Since official Swiss art was based on traditional tastes, it became almost impossible to obtain a public contract. Thus Evard slowly fell into oblivion and increasingly withdrew into a self- imposed isolation. His art constantly changed back and forth between a figurative and an abstract style. The numerous landscapes and still lifes were characterized by strong colors, in which his pantheistic vision of nature is expressed. Many sunsets and colourful Jura landscapes were created. Shortly before his death in 1972, he completed his last work ‚Äì a triumphantly luminous cross. Andr√© Evard was largely forgotten until today. In 1978 the collector J√ºrgen A. Messmer acquired a large part of the works of Andr√© Evard's estate and has since made them known through exhibitions in the Kunsthalle Messmer. Since 2007, the Kunsthalle has been awarding the International Andr√© Evard Award for Concrete and Constructivist Contemporary Art every 2-3 years, which is endowed with 10,000 euros.  Artistic work  After completing his studies, Evard initially painted in the French tradition of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Influences of Salon paintings, impressionism and symbolism were mixed with influences van Goghs, but also with those of Far Eastern art, whereby the various artist's styles seemed to merge into a very individual style. In his color compositions, Evard knew how to subject completely opposite colors to absolute harmony. Extreme freedom of feeling, great variety of moods, subtle color modulations and chromatic vivacity characterise his works, as Evard wants to give color its 'spirit'. Step by step he finally detaches himself from the given ornamental or symbolizing forms and reaches the structure via the ornament. In works such as Crocus, Roses, Roses noir, Chardon, Nocturne or Pyramid, for example, the emphasis is on a limited three-dimensional, physical or spatially geometric drawing. The paintings of the 20s are reminiscent of Wassily Kandinsky, Juan Gris and Georges Braque. Again, however, he seems to unite all influences in his very own style. The series of works called Roses are a prime example of the development from representational to constructive painting. Thus, in 1917, the Trois roses, the first version of the motif was created, to which he would devote himself for over a decade. For the first time, the tendency towards variation and an almost obsessive way of working becomes visible: sometimes he barely noticeably changes the colours, sometimes he changes the whole composition. The increasing abstraction of the natural object takes place here in an exemplary manner - from cubism to constructivism. While a certain trueness to color is important to him at first, he gradually abandons it, separates himself from the colors and inserts vertical and horizontal lines into the picture, so that the depicted object can almost be seen as a pure geometric form. Evard reduces the representationalism through spatial and surface tensions - but achieves emotional values such as warm and cold, light and dark, playful and harsh through the choice of color. Andr√© Evard's work is difficult to classify in the categories of art history. He was not committed to any particular style, but rather reverted to the past, mixed styles and invented something new. Art Nouveau, Cubism, and geometric-constructive abstractions all define his work. While in Paris he was part of the avant- garde, he later repeatedly withdrew to representational painting. On the one hand, the play of forms and colors leads to highly expressive representational landscapes, on the other hand, fascinating still lifes emerge from the clear reduction, which show unusual color combinations and completely new object- space relationships. In doing so, he always exposed himself to the risk of a stylistic break, which, however, is the special feature of his artistic oeuvre. He painted abstract when hardly anyone painted abstract and returned to representational painting when Abstract art dominated.  Works Online  * Decorative project for living room.

He acquired legal capacity in 1996. Investigator  Professional career  He took office as Prosecutor General on 18 December 2019 after his election on 14 November 2019. Prior to taking office, Ivan Geshev gained leadership experience over the years through the leading positions he held within the Prosecution ‚Äì Deputy Prosecutor General at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office (July 16, 2018 ‚Äì December 18, 2019) and Head of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office (July 19, 2016 ‚Äì July 16, 2018). Between May 11, 2012 and July 19, 2016 he was Prosecutor at Sofia City Prosecutor's Office. Before that, in the period from April 17, 2006 to May 11, 2012 Ivan Geshev worked as a Prosecutor at Sofia Regional Prosecutor's Office having higher rank of ‚ÄûProsecutor at the Prosecutor\`s Office of Appeal‚Äù and was promoted to the rank of ‚ÄúProsecutor at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor\`s Office and Supreme Administrative Prosecutor\`s Office‚Äù.

He was supported by a wide majority of 20 members of the SJC with only four voting against him. Coming to replace Sotir Tsatsarov, whose tenure expires in January. http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/2095238 At the plenum of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), in October 2019 the justice Minister Danail Kirilov did not nominate a candidate for new prosecutor general. This was the last JSC meeting where the Justice Minister could make a nomination. This leaves Deputy Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev the only candidate for the position. Geshev was nominated for prosecutor general by the SJC Prosecutors Chamber on July 22. He received the support of all eleven members of the Chamber, including that of Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov, whose term expired in January 2020. Kirilov explained that he considers Geshev's nomination as one of the professional circles. In his words, even if there were another nominee, the maximum support they would receive would be within the 14 votes of the SJC members. \\"That would result in no election, no result of the election procedure. It would also mean the creation of a precondition for confrontation between the two chambers of the SJC, which I believe is absolutely undesirable and should not be allowed in any way and for any reason,\\" the Minister said during the sitting. http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/2052962 =Protests= Ivan Geshev's nomination for General Prosecutor and the subsequent refusal of Minister of Justice Danail Kirilov to nominate a second candidate, which guarantees Geshev's appointment, sparked mass protests in Bulgaria in the summer of 2019. Those protesting demand Geshev's withdrawal from the competition for General Prosecutor. ‚ÄúGeshev is a disgrace,‚Äù ‚ÄúResign‚Äù and ‚ÄúMafia should go‚Äù were the slogans of the protests. Political scientist Evgenii Dainov criticized the nomination: ‚ÄúIvan Geshev clearly told us he will prosecute people from a list, without respecting the separation of powers. He will prosecute people who are inconvenient for him. He is extremely dangerous and he has revealed himself as the gravedigger of Bulgarian democracy‚Äù. Before becoming a Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev received both support and critic. With this regard Judge Zdravka Kalaidjieva, former judge at the European Court of Human Rights, is also concerned: ‚ÄúIn his interview with the Bulgarian National Television, Mr. Geshev presented his views on the prosecutor‚Äôs office as a repressive body against pre-selected ideological and economic opponents ‚Äì views which are contrary to the principle of equality before the law, pluralism of opinions and free competition. He believes the prosecution is a body whose main purpose is to arrest and conduct show operations and convict people instead of sending the suspects of a crime before a court which can hand down a verdict‚Äù. In response to the protests, colleagues of Ivan Geshev from the prosecution started a petition in his support. There were many declaration of Regional Prosecutor's Offices and jurists, who written expressed their support and hope about the nomination of Geshev. On the web-page of the Supreme Judicial Council were published also declaration for the nomination of Ivan Geshev, written by lawyers and university professors. https://www.standartnews.com/balgariya-pravosudie/ogromna-podkrepa-za- nominatsiyata-na-geshev-za-gl-prokuror-399970.html Some analysts believe Ivan Geshev may be a rocket carrier for a less public but equally controversial candidate who may be nominated after protests escalate. Prime Minister Boyko Borisov has already expressed his support for Member of European Parliament Emil Radev. Prominent civil society members and NGOs, including the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, asserted that he lacked the professional and moral qualities which are required for the position because of his record of abusing the law and human rights. = Chief Prosecutor of Bulgaria = In November 2019, Bulgaria's Supreme Judicial Council voted to appoint him to the office with 20 votes for and 4 against. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, however, refused to sign the decree formally inaugurating Geshev, remarking that his candidacy had been backed only by government-controlled institutions and that no other alternative was provided. He called on the judicial council to revise their decision. The council, however, voted in favour of Geshev a second time with the same vote margin, which triggred a constitutional requirement for Radev to sign the decree. Stating that he would refuse to violate the constitution, Radev did so following a meeting with Geshev, but called for changes to Bulgaria's constitution. Shortly before taking office, Geshev cancelled a meeting he had appointed with Bulgarian opposition leader Korneliya Ninova, after the latter announced that she would provide additional information to Geshev regarding a water availability crisis affecting Pernik. He accused Ninova of using the institution for \\"political gains\\". Ninova reacted by stating that it was his decision on whether or not to meet with her, but that she would nonetheless send him questions in written format. Investigations carried out by Ivan Geshev and investigations of Prosecutor's Office ruled by Ivan Geshev The main priorities of Ivan Geshev as Prosecutor General of the Republic of Bulgaria are the countering domestic crimes, drug trafficking and combating high corruption. =Sarafovo case= Life sentences without parole were imposed by the Specialized Criminal Court on Meliad Farah and Hassan al-Haj, accused by the Specialized Prosecutor's Office as perpetrators of the attack on Sarafovo Airport in 2012.The court also upheld the civil claims for non-pecuniary damages caused to the dead five Israeli citizens and one Bulgarian citizen, as well as for the many victims during the attack amounting to a total of over BGN 100 million. Meliad Farah and Hassan al-Haj were sentenced also to the maximum conviction of 10 years in prison each for using false official documents - false driving licenses of the State of Michigan and a social security card in order to conceal their identity on Bulgarian territory.The court held that the collected written, oral and physical evidence clearly indicated that Meliad Farah and Hassan al-Haj were the perpetrators of the organized terrorist attack against Israeli tourists on Bulgarian territory. The two defendants owning Australian and Canadian passports, were found to be of Lebanese descent and had links to the radical wing of the Shiite group ‚ÄúHezbollah‚Äù.

Furthermore, some representatives of the state authority, engaged with the monitoring of the gambling activities on national level, were also accused.https://bnr.bg/en/post/101276149/scandal- around-bulgarian-gambling-tycoon-vasil-bozhkov-continues Following an investigation of the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bulgaria for espionage, Russian citizens were forcibly removed because of accusation of their links with the intelligence services of the Russian Federation. Checks and investigations have been commissioned for identifying misuse of European Funds ‚Äì Rural Development Program ‚Äì Family Hotels; in addition, some of those involved were indicted for. =Revision of the Privatization cases= An in- depth review of the 30-years period of privatization of state-owned properties was commissioned based on information on possible harming of the public interest of billions of Euros. https://m.24chasa.bg/region/article/8212298 =Organized crimes cases= At the initiative of the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bulgaria, numerous actions have been taken in the past 4 months, aiming to cease the unregulated incineration of hazardous waste at the Bulgarian Thermal Power Station. Part of the amount waste was imported from European countries, therefor at the end of the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bulgaria this waste was exported back to the country of origin. A few days ago, the largest pollutant incinerating of hazardous waste, which many media have report over the years for, have ceased operations after an order of the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic Bulgaria. =Corporate Commercial Bank case= Ivan Geshev is most known for his role in the Corporate Commercial Bank case ‚Äì he describes himself as ‚Äúthe face of the team which worked on it‚Äù. After a rift between the bank's majority shareholder Tsvetan Vasilev and Delyan Peevski in 2014, the prosecution raided Vassilev's offices and triggered a run on the bank. Vassilev says the bank was attacked because he refused to transfer assets to Peevski ‚Äúfor free‚Äù. The Bulgarian National Bank did not provide a liquidity injection to the bank, put it under conservatorship and revoked its license. Depositors and shareholders were not allowed to appeal the decision ‚Äì there is pending litigation before the European Court of Human Rights and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Clients of the bank have also submitted a claim against Delyan Peevski and Bulgarian institutions in New York under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In 2017, Geshev indicted Vassilev and 17 other people for leading an organized criminal group, which allegedly drained the bank. Geshev compared writing the indictment to ‚Äúlanding on the Moon with a diesel engine‚Äù. When commentators wondered why Peevski was not questioned during the investigation, Geshev said that Putin and Obama were not questioned either. Critics have observed that the main witness against Vassilev, Biser Lazov, became a millionaire after the bank's closure by appropriating assets of the bank. Many believe the bank was purposefully bankrupted, so that its assets could be appropriated by political circles. In December 2018, the Specialized Prosecutor's Office raided the offices of Vassilev's lawyers and confiscated documents. Journalists commented that ‚Äúthe message was clear‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúif lawyers do not want to end in trouble, they should choose their clients carefully and avoid those who the prosecution wants to convict not based on proof, but on bla-bla from 1001 Nights‚Äù. In 2019, the prosecution arrested witnesses in the Corporate Commercial Bank case and raised charges against them. Free Europe reported that the charges have been raised based on unclear documents ‚Äì it was also ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù that the gendarmerie was mobilized and surrounded the court building when the people's measures were examined by the court. =Mladost case= A second case for which Ivan Geshev is known is the arrest and subsequent trial of Desislava Ivancheva and Bilyana Petrova, mayor and deputy mayor of the Mladost municipality of Sofia. The two were held in handcuffs for hours while media were invited to film. The women were held in custody during the trial in conditions which Bulgaria's ombudsman Maya Manolova described as unacceptable. In the summer of 2018, Ivancheva was escorted to hospital with handcuffs, leg cuffs and a protective belt, which human rights experts deemed to be an example of torture. Bilyana Petrova's lawyer Ir√®ne Savova was subjected to prosecutorial pressure as the prosecution opened 11 proceedings against her. Her apartment building was plastered with her obituaries ‚Äì an incident the prosecution refused to investigate even though it looked like a death threat. Ivancheva and Petrova were accused of asking for a bribe to provide a construction permit quickly, but the main witness against them retracted his testimony, arguing he was pressured to provide false statements by the prosecutors. Ivan Geshev said that ‚Äúall gypsies do this‚Äù and this was ‚Äúexpected‚Äù. Media reported that the other witness against Ivancheva and Petrova had common business interests with Ivan Geshev's spouse Detelina Hancheva. The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee argues the arrest of Ivancheva and Petrova in 2018 was a ‚Äúdrastic violation of human rights‚Äù. They also claim: ‚ÄúGeshev‚Äôs behavior either shows his lack of knowledge of human rights or the purposeful violation of human rights. Both hypotheses are inadmissible and their consequences will be examined by the European Court of Human Rights‚Äù. The arrests and abuses in custody of Ivancheva and Petrova were included in the 2018 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State as examples of human rights violations. =First case of preventing terrorism= In June 2019, Bulgaria's Prosecutor's Office arrested a 16-year-old boy with the claim they ‚Äúprevented a terrorist attack‚Äù. Ivan Geshev said this was a ‚Äúclassic case of recruitment by ISIS which lasted for up to a year‚Äù and this was ‚Äúthe first case of prevention of a terror attack‚Äù in Bulgaria. Geshev stated parents had to be vigilant because children get radicalized through the Internet. Shortly after, it turned out the parents of the boy contacted the authorities themselves because they were worried about the child's mental health. Even though the prosecution demanded the child's permanent arrest, the court released him under the condition of being monitored by a child psychologist. Commentators believe this operation is a publicity stunt aimed at improving the image of the prosecution. =Hacking of the National Revenue Agency= In July 2019, the personal data of millions of Bulgarians was distributed to the media ‚Äì it appeared the database of the country's National Revenue Agency was hacked. \\"So, at least for a year, the Bulgarian society, politicians, those who are in charge of the country, they knew quite well about the serious cybersecurity problems in the government infrastructures and they didn't do anything about it\\", a victim was quoted saying. The National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria and its gardens: the prosecution argues the hackers conspired to hack the gardens' sprinklers, spray cars and cause political instability The prosecution initially detained a 20-year old information security worker. However, Ivan Geshev announced that the main lead on which they work is ‚Äúcyber racketeering‚Äù and ‚Äúa conspiracy against the state‚Äù. Geshev also said the prosecution found ‚Äúhorrifying things‚Äù on the security worker's computer: he was searching information about Delyan Peevski, Boyko Borisov and Sotir Tsatsarov. Subsequently, the prosecution modified the charges ‚Äì the head of the company in which the information security expert worked, the commercial director and the expert himself were accused of terrorism. Prosecutor Evgeniya Stankova told the media that the three carried out ‚Äúactivity against the political system‚Äù. She said the three conspired to hack the sprinkler system of the gardens of the Bulgarian Parliament, to spray the cars of guests, and to induce panic among the general population in order to destabilize the whole political system. Free Europe, however, inquired before the Bulgarian National Assembly and found there was no electronic irrigation system: the gardens were watered with water carriers. The water terrorism theory by the prosecution inspired jokes and memes which were covered on national television. Personal views In a wide-ranging interview, Geshev saw the decision to keep churches open to the public for Easter in the midst of the COVID‚Äì19 pandemic in Bulgaria as a \\"sign from God that things will be all right for us [Bulgarians].\\" He went on to question the faith of other Orthodox churches that closed down services to the public, and described opposition to the decision in the country as an \\"anarcho-liberal circle which doesn't like anything Bulgarian or national.\\" Geshev also cited the \\"anarcho-liberal\\" reaction following his nomination as a driving force to continue with the process. He revealed his personal philosophy is that \\"one is not a bad person for doing bad things but for enjoying them,\\" and that he sees himself \\"as an instrument in the hands of God.\\" The Chief Prosecutor attempted to allay fears of an economic crash by sharing he has read that, if need be, the population could be fed fish for a year without any import. Personal life Ivan Geshev has two daughters with his partner Detelina Hancheva. In 2019, media reported that Detelina Hancheva had common business interests with the key witness in the Mladost case in which Geshev was the main prosecutor. Neither the prosecution nor the Supreme Judicial Council opened an investigation to establish if this conflict of interest influenced the proceedings. In August 2019 Bivol established Detelina Hancheva had bought a flat from a company owned by the main witness at below the market price. In July 2020, again the investigative journalists from Bivol.bg published article with the connection of Ivan Geshev and partner Detelina Hancheva to the underground world. The article points out questionable connection between Geshev and the supposed \\"abductor\\" of Hancheva, Yuri Galev. Geshev was prosecutor in the case against Galev and throughout the investigation, evidence mysteriously disappeared, including Hnacheva's name in relation to the case, which eventually lead to Galev's acquittal. as in almost all of Geshev's prosecution cases.https://bivol.bg/en/life-partner-of-bulgarian- prosecutor-general-linked-to-organized-crime-controversial-energy-mogul.html References Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Bulgarian jurists ","title":"Ivan Geshev"},{"id":"61453513","text":"George Hillyard Swinstead by Banister Fletcher George Hillyard Swinstead (1860-1926) was a British artist associated with the Suffolk school.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 20, 2019. Gameplay Rad is a roguelike video game played from an isometric perspective. In the game, players control a teenager whose goal is to explore a procedurally-generated wasteland for effigies known as respirators, items that may restore the human civilizations after a devastating apocalypse. As the character explores the wasteland, their genes will mutate, granting players additional powers and perks. For each character, players can have unlimited passive bonuses and at most three active mutations. If the player character dies, they will be replaced by a new character. Development Lee Petty, the director for Headlander, served as the game's director. The game was inspired by his teenagehood and his love for 1980s aesthetics. In each run, abilities are gained randomly. According to Petty, this creates different combinations, which enables players to better explore the strengths and weaknesses of each mutation. The game was officially announced in March 2019 by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One on August 20, 2019. Reception Rad received generally positive reviews upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Despite the Carosello‚Äôs popularity, its formula (mini-films and cartoons, about two minutes long) is considered obsolete by the advertising agencies, which by now prefer the spots, shorter (thirty seconds) and more effective. *20 January.

RAI begins, after six months of experimentation, the official broadcastings in color. The first shows aired, on RAI 1, are the TV movie The suicide club, of the series Mystery and imagination, and an ABBA concert; the next day, RAI 2 airs the first movie in colors, The arrangement. Then, it's the turn of the first TV journal (21 February) and of the first RAI fiction (The fatal eggs, 27 February, see below). However, the complete switch-off of the black and white will need two years, also because, in a time of deep economic crisis, the color sets are above the means of many Italian families. * 22 April. Fifteen years after the Canzonissima scandal, Dario Fo and Franca Rame come back in RAI with an anthology of their most famous pieces.

It is a restaurant discovery tool that uses various technologies to collect and index restaurant menus and information.  History  Sirved was founded in 2015 by Jonathan Leslie and Kyle Brown. The company was originally designed to be an online food ordering service, similar to Just Eat and GrubHub. However, in 2018 the company re-focused its efforts into making itself a \\"restaurant discovery platform\\" expanding on their searching and discovery features.  Growth and Expansion  After their initial launch in 2015, Sirved began building a database of restaurant menus - starting in Windsor, Ontario. They expanded into more regions, eventually including menus from the rest of Canada and the United States. Their menu database now hosts menus for over 400,000 restaurants. During their expansion into the US market, Sirved was featured in the Start-Up Alley at the 2018 National Restaurant Association show at McCormick Place in Chicago.  Technology  Sirved uses various technologies to analyze restaurant menus. Through this process they use artificial intelligence algorithms and other techniques to index restaurant menus, allowing users to find specific food items on particular menus through a menu-driven search engine.  Rebranding  When Sirved first launched, the branding consisted of a red logo featuring a crossed fork and knife. In 2019 the company decided to rebrand following the 2018 pivot from online ordering to \\"restaurant discovery\\". Sirved rebraded with a new logo featuring a multi-tool with a fork and spoon, and switched their company colour to purple. This rebranding came alongside a redesigned version of their website, IOS and Android mobile apps.  Community Outreach  Sirved has partnered with the Canadian Mental Health Association as part of the Sole Focus Project. As part of the partnership, users of the service could purchase fan event tickets to a Detroit Tigers baseball game, which included a donation to the Canadian Mental Health Association and the Sole Focus Project. Sirved has partnered with Windsors Carrousel of Nations event, acting as a companion app for the event. The app was used to showcase the menus for each of the food villages and the events that took place. This allowed each of the event locations to have their location and menu made accessible on the internet.

It existed during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs, its formation probably influenced by volcanism and faulting. The bed of the former lake had plentiful resources for early humans, and today it is used for agriculture.  Background  It has been known for over a century that large lakes previously existed in the Western United States, most notably Nevada's Lake Lahontan and Utah's Lake Bonneville. Such lakes also formed in eastern Oregon, where present-day Malheur Lake and Goose Lake are remnants of former pluvial lakes. Lake Modoc was so named by Samuel N. Dicken, professor of geography at the University of Oregon. The region of Lake Modoc was first described during the early and mid-19th century.  The lake  Lake Modoc was a pluvial lake that existed during the Pleistocene in basins formed by faulting and volcanism, which left. It covered a length of from south of Tule Lake in California to near present-day Fort Klamath in Oregon, its waters reaching an elevation of about above sea level and covering an area of about with a highly irregular shape. Several islands formed in the lake, such as the Klamath Hills, present-day Miller Hill close to Klamath Falls and Turkey Hill close to Malin. The shoreline of Lake Modoc is well visible close to Tule Lake. = Hydrology = Unlike other pluvial lakes, Lake Modoc had a steady inflow of surface water, owing to its proximity to snow- and glacier-covered mountains of the Cascade Range. Its watershed extended over present-day Modoc and Siskiyou counties (both in California), and Jackson, Klamath and Lake counties (all in Oregon), including the Williamson River, Sprague River and Lost River. Cinder, pumice and volcanic ash from the Cascades filled the lake. Lake Modoc also featured an outflow, at first to the south before a lava flow blocked it, although seepage continued from there to this day. Presently, the Klamath River drains the area. Given that the basin at present cannot hold a lake the size of Lake Modoc, it is likely that its formation and demise was influenced by the existence of outlets.  History  Lake Modoc was probably formed by geologic processes such as faulting or by the Medicine Lake Volcano blocking a former southward-draining outlet. The lake appears to have existed during the Pleistocene and late Pliocene, with some lake deposits estimated to be at least 3 million years old. During marine oxygen isotope stage 4, Lake Modoc was deep and cold. Water levels began to decrease as the Pleistocene ended, as the climate became drier and the outlet to the Klamath River lower. The former lake floor is nearly level, and the shoreline is almost unwarped. Today, Tule Lake, Upper Klamath Lake and Lower Klamath Lake remain from Lake Modoc; Upper Klamath Lake is the largest present-day lake in Oregon by surface area. The floor of the drying lake featured deep soils and abundant vegetation, water and wildlife; thus it was quickly populated by humans who migrated there over 3,000 years ago. The former lakebed is now used as cropland, and agriculture is the most important human land use in the region. Part of the southern shoreline has been covered by lava flows, and geologic processes have continued into the Holocene; the Glass Mountain lava flow was emplaced about 1,000 years ago, and some Holocene lava flows have been faulted.

She belonged to a revival movement marked by Pietistic and Moravian influences, a member of a group known as \\"Readers\\", a background shared by Laestadius' mother. Biography Milla Clementsdotter was born November 1, 1812, in Orrn√§sfj√§ll, F√∂llinge, Sweden. Her parents were Clemmens Andersson and Anna Larsdotter. Because the father was an alcoholic, the family lost all of its property. After her father's death in 1817, his mother remarried Torkel Jonsson. That led to Clementsdotter to having a half- sister, Sara Brita, who was born in 1825. At the age of six, she went to live with a family that farmed, before being removed to various foster families, where she received abusive treatment. She subsequently developed a deep belief in Christianity. In 1840, Clementsdotter married Tomas P√•lsson. Clementsdotter and Laestadius probably met on 1 January 1844 in the municipality of Krokom in J√§mtland during an inspection tour of √Ösele. According to Laestadius, Clementsdotter had previously met the priest Pehr Brandell of the Church of Sweden in the parish of Nora in the municipality of Kramfors in √Öngermanland, where Brandell freed her from the doubt regarding Christianity. She told Laestadius about her spiritual experiences on her journey to a truly living Christianity, and recited various biblical teachings to Laestadius. The meeting between Clementsdotter and Laestadius was a turning point in Laestadius's life. Afterwards, he felt he had come to understand the secret of living faith. He was inspired by her simple tales of \\"experiences in the order of grace,\\" as Laestadius himself called it. After the meeting, he started the proclamation which marked the beginning of Laestadianism. This is how the meeting between Clementsdotter and Laestadius gained historical and spiritual significance for many people.

In 1999, the brand was acquired by Gretsch from McCarty, which owned it until 2019, when Bigsby was sold to Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. An early innovator of solid body electric guitars and accessories, the company was the first to introduce a guitar headstock that had all of its tuning pegs on the same side. This design was later adopted by manufacturers such as Fender for their Telecaster and Stratocaster models. Most well known, however, was the development of the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, a wildly popular vibrato arm for guitars that was installed on their own models, as well as numerous other companies such as Gretsch, Gibson, Ibanez and many others.  History  Eastwood Airline Coronado DLX The company was founded as \\"Bigsby Electric Guitar Company\\" by Paul Bigsby, a motorcycle repairman. Bigsby was friends with several musicians, including Merle Travis and Spade Cooley. He started repairing guitars on the side, and gained a reputation for his innovative modifications. Merle Travis approached Bigsby to repair his Gibson L-10's Kauffman Vibrola arm. Instead, Bigsby came up with a completely new design to replace it, which evolved into the Bigsby tailpiece that became a world-wide standard for electric guitar vibrato arms. Travis later came up with a rough design for a guitar with a unique headstock that had all of its tuning pegs on one side. Bigsby hand-built the guitar for him, and based on its success, started a small workshop next to his house in Downey, California to build electric guitars. Besides solid-body electric guitars, he also custom-manufactured steel guitars, both lap steel and pedal steel varieties. Most famously, in 1948 he built the custom, triple-neck four- pedal model played by Speedy West, one of the first such pedal steel guitars to be used in country music. Bigsby hand-built all of his own instruments, down to hand-wiring his own pickups, though the demand for his custom guitars as well as his popular vibrato tailpiece often meant that there was a waiting list in excess of two years for his guitars. In declining health, and unable to meet demand, he sold the company to Ted McCarty in 1966.Company history on Bigsby website Bigsby kept very poor records of his work, so the company's output of custom guitars under Paul Bigsby's ownership is mostly speculation. Current company historians \\"can document only 47 steels, six standard guitars, one tenor guitar, two double neck guitars, two mandolins and six neck replacements that are still around today\\" that were authentic Paul Bigsby constructions. For many decades, the brand was only used for its vibrato tailpieces, though periodically limited runs of guitars, mostly of replica models of Paul Bigsby's original designs, have been produced. Until recently, the company offered seven different solid body electric guitar models. In January 2019, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation announced the acquisition of the Bigsby brand and its assets from Fred Gretsch Enterprises.FENDER¬Æ MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF BIGSBY¬Æ, Scottsdale, ARIZ, Jan 13, 2019  References   External links  * Official website Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Guitar parts and accessories Category:Fender Musical Instruments Corporation Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in California ","title":"Bigsby Electric Guitars"},{"id":"61454077","text":"Lepidium foliosum, commonly known as leafy peppercress, is a shrubby species of plant found in southern regions of Australia, usually close to the coast.

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, it is a live action/CGI adaptation of the 1989 animated film of the same name, which is itself based on Hans Christian Andersen's eponymous tale. Serving as producers are Marshall, John DeLuca, Marc Platt, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the latter whom will co-write new songs for the remake with the original film's composer/co-songwriter, Alan Menken, with Menken also returning to compose the score. The film will star Halle Bailey, Jonah Hauer- King, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy with Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, and Awkwafina in voice roles. Cast *Halle Bailey as Princess Ariel: A mermaid and King Triton's youngest daughter who is fascinated with the human world. Director Rob Marshall said that \\"Halle possesses that rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance ‚Äî plus a glorious singing voice ‚Äî all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role\\", and that the film is about \\"[Ariel] finding her voice [...] And that immediately just felt like an interesting, timely piece that resonated with [the production crew]\\". Bailey said that she wanted to bring \\"freshness\\" to the character. She also said that \\"[i]t's amazing that the directors have been so forward in asking [her] to show [her] true self... that's been a really fun growing experience\\". Co-star Daveed Diggs said that the remake will give \\"some more power\\" to Ariel than the original film. *Jonah Hauer-King as Eric, a prince whom Ariel falls in love with after saving him from drowning, while he becomes determined to find Ariel. *Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, a sea witch whom Ariel makes a deal with to become a human, which is secretly part of Ursula's plan to take over Atlantica. *Javier Bardem as King Triton, Ariel's overprotective father and the king of Atlantica, who is prejudiced towards humans. *Emily Coates =Voices= *Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, a loyal crab and King Triton's trusted servant who watches over Ariel. *Jacob Tremblay as Flounder, an easily scared tropical fish who is Ariel's best friend. *Awkwafina as Scuttle, a dim- witted diving bird and a friend of Ariel's, to whom she provides inaccurate descriptions of any object Ariel finds. The character will be portrayed as a female diving bird instead of a male seagull as in the original in order to both fit the actress' gender and feature her in underwater scenes. Production =Development= On May 25, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Disney is in early development for a live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid. On August 16, 2016, it was announced that Lin-Manuel Miranda, a fan of the original film, will co-produce the film with Marc Platt. Studio veterans Lindsay Lohan and Chris Evans expressed interest in starring in the adaptation. On December 6, 2017, it was reported that Rob Marshall was being courted by the Walt Disney Company to direct the film, while Jane Goldman will serve as screenwriter. On December 5, 2018, Marshall revealed that he, along with John DeLuca and Marc Platt were hired to begin developing the project for film adaptation, and said that \\"John and [Marshall] have begun our work trying to explore it and figure it out\\", as he felt that \\"it's a very complicated movie to take from animation to live-action. Live-action's a whole other world so you have to be very careful about how that's done, but so we're starting the exploration phase\\". Later in December, Marshall was officially hired as director for the film. During an interview on December 21, 2018, Marshall revealed that the film is in very early stages of development, stating that the studio is trying to explore ways to translate the original film's story into live-action. On July 3, 2019, David Magee, who previously wrote the screenplay for Marshall's Mary Poppins Returns, was revealed to have written the script with Goldman. On February 10, 2020, Miranda revealed that rehearsals for the film had already begun. =Casting= On June 28, 2019, it was announced that Melissa McCarthy was in talks to play Ursula in the film. The next month, Jacob Tremblay, Awkwafina, Halle Bailey, and Javier Bardem joined the cast while Harry Styles was considering the role of Prince Eric. However, Styles was later revealed to have turned down the part. In October, Daveed Diggs, who previously worked on Miranda's play Hamilton, joined the cast. In November 2019, it was reported that Jonah Hauer-King had been cast as Eric. Cameron Cuffe was also in the running for the role, before Hauer-King was cast. On February 18, 2020, McCarthy confirmed her casting as Ursula during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show: \\"I play Ursula, the sea witch. It is so fun, we're just in rehearsals. It's been an absolute blast. Stepping into the world of Rob Marshall, it's like a fever dream, I just went to London for a week, I was like, 'I don't get to go to dance camp for a week.' All day he's like, 'Do you want to slide down this 40-foot clam shell?' I'm like, 'Yes! Of course I do. What are you, crazy?' It's been wildly creative.\\" In July 2020, it was announced that Kacey Musgraves was considered for the part of Vanessa (Ursula's human form), but she turned down the role. In October 2020, actress Emily Coates joined the film in an undisclosed role. Casting controversy Bailey's casting as Ariel was met with a polarized response in social media. By July 5, 2019, the hasthag #NotMyAriel was reported to have become the number one topic after Bailey's casting, though it was noted that only half of its use was to criticize her casting, while the other half was to criticize her protestors. On July 6, 2019, Disney released a statement defending Bailey's casting. On July 15, 2019, a poll revealed that Bailey's casting was met with a mostly positive response. Jodi Benson, Ariel's original voice actress, also defended Bailey's casting, by arguing that \\"[t]he most important thing is to tell the story\\" and that \\"the spirit of a character is what really matters\\". During an interview on August 12, 2019, Bailey said that \\"[she doesn't] pay attention to the negativity\\", while Auli ªi Cravalho, who played Ariel in a musical presentation as a part of The Wonderful World of Disney, expressed excitement at watching Bailey's portrayal of the character. Brandy, the first Black actress to play Cinderella on-screen in the racially diverse TV film of the same name, also praised the casting of Bailey. =Filming= Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin in April 2020, in London. However, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 29, 2020, Tremblay began recording his lines for the film. Filming was then expected to commence on August 10, 2020, but it was delayed yet again to late November/early December 2020 in order to accommodate McCarthy's schedule for the Hulu limited series, Nine Perfect Strangers. Music On March 17, 2017, it was announced that Alan Menken, who previously scored and co-wrote songs for the original film, would return as the film's composer and to write new songs alongside producer Lin-Manuel Miranda. On May 20, 2019, Menken stated that The Little Mermaid would be his next project, following the release of the live-action adaptation of Aladdin, and on July 9, he and Miranda started working on new songs for the film. On replacing the original film's lyricist, the late Howard Ashman, Miranda felt that \\"[he] will definitely fall short\\" to Ashman's work, arguing that \\"no one can write like him\\". On September 17, 2019, it was reported that Menken and Miranda wrote a new song for Prince Eric, which Menken confirmed on October 11, 2019, and revealed that he and Miranda wrote \\"like four or five new songs\\" for the film, including a new song for Eric and Ariel, a new song for King Triton as well as a song for Scuttle. On January 16, 2020, Halle Bailey confirmed that the song \\"Part of Your World\\", from the original film, will appear in the remake. On February 10, 2020, Miranda revealed that he and Menken wrote four new songs for the film. On March 22, 2020, Menken revealed that the songs for the film have already been recorded.

The compromise built on earlier deals like the Massachusetts Compromise to call for the use of the Convention provision written into the newly ratified Constitution in order to get the amendments demanded by New York and other states. Melancton Smith lead the Anti-Federalists at the New York Ratifying Convention in Poughkeepsie. John Jay and Alexander Hamilton were among the leaders of the Federalists. A majority of the Convention were Anti-Federalists. But after New Hampshire and Virginia ratified the Constitution, many felt it was no longer practical to insist on amendments before ratifying. With 10 other States having ratified, the Constitution was clearly going into effect, the debate was whether or not New York would be a part of it. Smith proposed that the States call for a Convention under Article V as a condition of New York's ratification, but Jay and Hamilton altered the proposal to ratification unconditionally, but with the understanding that the Article V Convention procedure would be used. The delegates assigned both Smith and Jay to the committee to draft the letter, though ultimately the draft adopted by the New York Convention was written by John Jay with help from Hamilton and John Lansing, Jr.. The Convention adopted the letter unanimously. Governor of New York and Chair of the Convention George Clinton sent the letter to all of the States and championed the proposal in the New York State Legislature to call for the Convention. Virginia and New York were the only two states to call for the Convention. The response in other states varied from outright rejection to consideration only after giving Congress a chance to propose the amendments first. James Madison opposed the idea of early amendments, advocating a few years of seeing how the Constitution would run first. However, he believed that if amendments were to be proposed early, especially if some of them went to the heart of the function of Congress before Congress had a chance to demonstrate how well it would work, it would be better if they were proposed by Congress. Madison, a member of the first United States House of Representatives, proposed the Bill of Rights partially in response to the Convention effort.

It is not attested before the 13th century, but it is possible that it existed already as part of the middle Byzantine thema of Chaldia, as the medieval administrative districts in the area coincided with geographical regions and have remained consistent to the present day. The boundaries of Matzouka extended south and southwest of Mount Minthrion (modern Boztepe), its southern limit along a line stretching from the Zigana summit of Mount Paryadres in the west and the Pontic Gates (modern Kolabat Bogazi) in the east. Its strategic importance was great, as it guarded the approaches to Trebizond, the capital of the empire, and as Matzouka was the heartland of the Empire of Trebizond. Around the capital of the district were the forests where the emperors had their summer palaces.

Ellis was the pseudonym used by Derek Lindsay (1920‚Äì2000), a British novelist and playwright, to publish his novel, The Rack, and to write two plays, Grand Manouevres and Seagull Rising. Lindsay/Ellis was orphaned as a child and served in the British army in World War II. After the war he went to the University of Oxford and was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was treated in a sanatorium in the French Alps, one of the last people to undergo this form of therapy. The Rack is a detailed account of the experience and received high acclaim when it was published in 1958, from Graham Greene and Anthony Burgess and others. It was favourably compared with The Magic Mountain and has been in print ever since. However, it was the only novel Ellis published. Although there was said to be an unpublished novel left after his death, this has never appeared, although a \\"restored edition\\" of The Rack, with passages removed from the first edition by its editor, James Michie, re-inserted, has been published. He also wrote at least two plays. Grand Manouevres, about the Dreyfus Affair, was produced at the National Theatre in 1974 and received a hostile reception, while Seagull Rising, inspired by Chekhov, was put on at The Questors Theatre in 1977. He was described as \\"saturnine and reclusive\\", but had many friends, including Graham Greene, who compared The Rack with Ulysses in importance, Kenneth Tynan and Andrew Sinclair, who both wrote about him and Cyril Connolly. He had a son, Timon, with Marianne Sinclair, Andrew Sinclair's first wife.

The book is based on Bushnell's real life experiences after divorcing at age 50. The title of the book references Sex and the City, a popular book by Bushnell. Plot This book focuses on a new set of characters: \\"Sassy, Kitty, Queenie, Tilda Tia and Marilyn.\\" The book follows the women as they experience mid-life dating and relationships in the 21st century, occurring between a fictional place called \\"The Village\\" (based on the real life Hamptons) and Manhattan. This includes adoration from a younger man, experimenting with the dating scene on Tinder, and other explorations. About the author Candace Bushnell (born December 1, 1958) is an American author and television producer. She began her career as a freelance journalist.

She is most notable for her creative affiliation with the long running HBO series Sex and the City, which aired from 1998 to 2004, and her novel with the same title. The book \\"Sex and the City\\" was also the basis for two eponymously titled movies. In 1978, at age 19, she moved to New York City.

It was released on Steam early access in January 2020, and will be fully released in October 2020. It is the sequel to Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2.  Gameplay  Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3 narratively follows the previous game in a dystopian America in 2042 that has been ravaged by war, which had caused the destruction of the former restaurant. Two search and recovery androids, Cleaver and Whisk (voiced by Havana Mahoney and Negaoryx, respectively) find the chef (the player- character) still alive, and offer them their truck to use as a food truck to continue the restaurant. They become part of a national food truck championship as the game progresses. As with previous Cook, Serve, Delicious games, the player is challenged to make dishes to customer order at various prep and holding stations within the food truck. Prior to each day, the player assembles a menu of five to eight dishes, each dish having a point value from zero to five representing how difficult it is to prep. Certain days may require a minimum point value or specific number of dishes with a specific point value, or feature foods of a specific type or requiring a specific cooking step. After establishing a menu for the day, the food truck sets off for the day, making two or more stops. Prior to each stop, the player can use holding stations to cook ready-to-serve meals, and make special orders to prepare at the prep stations to serve once at the next stop. At each stop, the player either can serve completed dishes from the prep or holding stations, or make custom orders for certain dishes, but has a limited amount of time to serve all waiting customers. Preparing dishes requires a sequence of keyboard- and-mouse or controller actions, itemized on-screen, though with most dishes the customer may wish for custom preparation on their dish (such as condiments on a hamburger) which the player must follow. The player is ranked based on how many orders they serve both in a fixed time period once the order is placed, and to the custom preparation, and penalized for failing to complete orders or for missing key cooking steps like cooking meat. After completing the day, the player is rewarded with in-game currency that can be used to buy new recipes and improved equipment for the truck. Some gameplay changes are made in Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3 from past titles. With the food truck setting there are no longer any chores that must be completed. The player also has the opportunity to use one of the android drivers to serve off all completed orders while the player completes other orders. Each day can also be run in a \\"Chill\\" mode, reducing the number and rate of orders to be processed but reducing the potential rewards the player earns from completing a run.

ZimmermanThe spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early 1800s, on his Social Security card and Social Security death notice, on his funeral program, and by his daughters (sometimes spelled Zinnerman) was born in Grady, Alabama . He married Ruth Sellers in the late 1920s, and lived with her and their children near Beauregard, Mississippi. He played guitar and harmonica in local juke joints, often practising at night in local cemeteries where he would not disturb others. He became known for his guitar skills, and gave guitar lessons. Robert Johnson, who had been born in nearby Hazlehurst, came back to the area, probably around 1931, and sought out Zimmerman with the intention of improving his fingerpicking and bottleneck guitar skills.

After practising together while sitting on tombstones in Beauregard Cemetery - though to be a contributory factor to the legend of Johnson \\"selling his soul to the Devil\\" in order to play well - the pair toured local lumber camps and juke joints before Johnson began performing on his own. When he returned to his home in Clarksdale, Johnson impressed locals with how much his performing skills had improved during his time away, and, in 1936 and 1937, recorded the songs that eventually secured his status as one of the most important and influential blues performers. Members of Zimmerman's family have claimed that some of Johnson's songs, including \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\", were in fact written by Zimmerman before Johnson stayed with the household, and others including \\"Dust My Broom\\" and \\"Come On In My Kitchen\\" were written by Johnson and Zimmerman together. Zimmerman himself never made any recordings, though he performed widely in Mississippi. He gave up playing blues music, probably in the 1950s, and became a Pentecostal minister. He moved to California around 1960, and died in Compton, Los Angeles, from a heart attack in 1967, aged 60.

Hans Memling, about 1470 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) Vindicta Salvatoris, sometimes known by its translated title The Avenging of the Saviour, is a legendary text which, like other supplements to the Gospel of Nicodemus, is grouped among the New Testament Apocrypha. It includes the story of Saint Veronica's miraculous veil, imprinted with the face of Jesus, which also featured in the slightly earlier Cura sanitatis Tiberii.Remi Gounelle, \\"Les origines litt√©raires de la l√©gende de V√©ronique et de la Sainte Face: la Cura sanitatis Tiberii et la Vindicta Saluatoris\\" in A. Monaci Castagno, ed., Sacre impronte e oggetti ¬´ non fatti da mano d‚Äôuomo ¬ª nelle religioni (Turin: Edizioni dell‚ÄôOrso, 2011) pp. 231-251 Two Latin versions of the Vindicta Salvatoris exist, both dated to the 8th or 9th centuries and thought to have been composed in southern France. The shorter version was published by Constantin von Tischendorf in Evangelia apocrypha, a collection of Greek and Latin texts.Constantin von Tischendorf, Evangelia apocrypha. 2nd ed. (Leipzig: H. Mendelssohn, 1876) pp. 470-486 It relates that Titus was a local ruler under the emperor Tiberius \\"in the region of Equitania in the Libian city called Burdigalla\\" or \\"Burgidalla\\". Titus, suffering from cancer of the face, hears from Nathan, an Arab trader from Judea, about the miracles of Jesus. Accepting Jesus as Lord and condemning the Jews who executed him, Titus is immediately cured. He sends for Vespasian, and together they set out for Judea where they destroy Jerusalem to avenge Jesus. They report to Tiberius, also incurably sick, who sends his minister Velosianus to Judea for more information. He learns of Veronica's veil, and also hears the full story of the crucifixion and resurrection, including Pontius Pilate's part in the story, from Joseph of Arimathea. Joseph and Veronica accompany Velosianus to Rome. Tiberius is cured by Veronica's veil and accepts Christianity. Pilate is imprisoned.Walker (1870); Cowper (1881) The longer version was not fully published until 1996,J. E. Cross et al., eds, Two Old English Apocrypha and Their Manuscript Source. The Gospel of Nichodemus and The Avenging of The Saviour (Cambridge, 1996) pp. 248-292 but a summary appeared in 1932. In this version Titus is sub-king of Bordeaux and Pilate is eventually imprisoned in Vienne (both cities in modern France), where he is kept in darkness and is forbidden any cooked food. Eventually he asks for an apple and a knife with which to peel it, and commits suicide by stabbing himself with the knife. The people of Vienne, after several failed attempts to rid themselves of his body, manage to do so by floating it down the Rhone in a barrel. It strikes a rock, which opens to engulf Pilate's body.E.

Introduced by German automaker BMW as an option for the 2013 BMW X5 (F15), sDrive uses torque-vectoring and displacement mechanisms that optimise agility and efficiency. Today, sDrive is available on all of BMW's utility vehicles, from the X1 through X7. Prior to the introduction of sDrive, the majority of monocoque SUV's came with all-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, or front-wheel drive. The two-wheel drive systems present at the time were generally purpose- built for car applications in terms of handling and durability. Rear-wheel drive was generally only seen on body-on-frame vehicles such as pickup trucks and large SUV's. Prior to the F15 X5, all BMW SUV's came standard with BMW xDrive, the company's symmetric all-wheel drive system. These vehicles proved popular to general consumers but lacked the drivability and steering preciseness of the company's sedans and sports cars. The development of sDrive took approximately eight years, and the internal architecture primarily took cues from BMW's sedan rear-wheel drive over xDrive. However, the slip differential needed to be built more substantially to enable the torque- vectoring system on heavier vehicles. Today, sDrive is a popular option on BMW's SUVs. Nearly 35% of all SUV's sold in North America are optioned with sDrive. Many journalists have compared sDrive's agility to be similar to BMW's smaller sedans, particularly in the case of the BMW X3 (G01).

She wrote two novels in the 1950s, wrote for Liberty magazine and Los Angeles Daily News, edited a collection of short stories with publisher Bennett Cerf, and collaborated with her second husband Arthur Hornblow Jr. on a series of children's books from 1965 to 1974. Biography Hornblow was born Leonora Salmon June 3, 1920 in New York City to Ruby and Sidney Salmon. When she was a baby, Hornblow was given the nickname \\"Bubbles\\" by her mother because Leonora was not considered \\"a baby's name\\", something which she later resented. Her mother married tobacco baron Leon Schinasi and Hornblow became his stepdaughter. She was raised in New York City, and began writing from an early age. In 1939, Hornblow married actor Wayne Morris; the 18-month marriage produced a son, Michael. She subsequently married film producer and writer Arthur Hornblow Jr. at the home of publisher Bennett Cerf in 1945. The following year, she began writing fashion notes for Liberty magazine and later wrote book reviews for Los Angeles Daily News. Hornflow wrote her first novel, Memory and Desire, in 1950, centred on the film community. She joined the Authors Guild soon after. She had her sole appearance in a motion picture as a character actress in the 1952 war drama film Thunder in the East. In 1957, her second novel, The Love Seekers, was published, and she later moved into book editing with Cerf on a collection of short stores entitled Bennett Cerf‚Äôs Take Along Treasury. Hornblow wrote a children's book on the Egyptian queen Cleopatra in 1961. This was followed by a collaboration with her husband on more children's books as Birds Do the Strangest Things in 1965, Fish Do the Strangest Things the next year, Insects Do the Strangest Things in 1968, Reptiles Do the Strangest Things in 1970, and Prehistoric Monsters Did the Strangest Things in 1974. After the death of her husband in 1976, Hornblow returned to New York City and ran a stationary shop. She returned to writing fiction with the publication of her final book, Animals Do the Strangest Things in 1989. Hornblow was unable to write any further books due to the loss of her manuscript while she was moving to North Carolina so that she could be closer to her son in 2003. She died at her home in Fearrington Village, North Carolina on November 5, 2005 after a short undisclosed illness. Personality and legacy Sidney Zion described Hornblow as \\"the sawiest broad in town\\". The personal papers and biographical details of Hornblow and her husband are housed in the Margaret Herrick Library, which is operated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Constituent Mandate 13 was the constitutional norm that Rafael Correa, former president of Ecuador, secured from his country's Constituent Assembly, in order to justify the illegal confiscation of GAMMA VISION, TC TELEVISION and other media companies (over 200 companies illegally seized) owned by The Isaias Group. Mandate 13 was solely dedicated to the Isaias businesses and includes the statement that the administrative resolution used to confiscate their properties. It even contained a clause warning that any judge or magistrate in Ecuador who ruled in favor of the Isaias brothers would be removed from the bench and open to criminal prosecution: > \\"... is not subject to actions for the protection of constitutional rights > or to any other actions of a special nature.

This is a challenge due to the fact that the line would need to cross the Guanabara Bay, presumably underwater.  Background  The plan to build a subway line connecting Rio de Janeiro to its sister municipality, Niter√≥i, has existed since at least 1968. In the 1968 plan, it was estimated that hte line would've been built by 1990. However, that deadline was never met. Throughout the following years, many more promises were made ‚Äì and subsequently not kept ‚Äì by a multitude of governors of Rio de Janeiro regarding the construction of Line 3: * In 2002, the project was divided into two parts: part 1, with a length of , extending underneath Guanabara Bay from Carioca Station (Rio de Janeiro) to (Niter√≥i); and part 2, with a length of roughly , extending from (Niter√≥i) to Guaxindiba (S√£o Gon√ßalo), with segments above ground. * In 2006, a seminar called \\"Rio de Janeiro on Rails ‚Äì Subway Line 3\\" () was held by the Brazilian Association of the Railway Industry (, shortened as ABIFER) to discuss the implementation of the project of Line 3. * In 2011, the Brazilian Ministry of Works announced that construction on the line would begin that year for a 2014 opening. The line would feature an existing suburban rail alignment in Niter√≥i, S√£o Gon√ßalo and Itabora√≠ being upgraded to metro standard, and a tunnel under Guanabara Bay to Rio de Janeiro. Federal funds for the construction, totalling R$ 1.2 billion, were initially intended to be granted in 2012, but were barred by Congress in late 2011. * In September 2013, governor S√©rgio Cabral and president Dilma Rousseff announced a partnership between the federal and state governments, with the goal of collecting R$ 2.57 billion in total to be put towards the construction of Line 3. * In October 2014, governor Pez√£o stated his intent in starting the construction of Line 3 before the end of the year. Eight months later, in June 2015, Pez√£o explained that the state's government didn't have the necessary funds to build it, which had an estimated cost of R$ 3.9 billion. The Director Plan of Urban Transportation of 2015 () estimated that construction of its many projects should be done by 2036, but that it would be ideal for them to be finished by 2021. * In July 2019, governor Wilson Witzel guaranteed that, during his administration, the construction of Line 3 would begin. Six months later, in January 2020, Witzel stated that the administration was considering whether building more boat stations would be more effective than building Line 3.

At the age of two, Lewton moved with his family to Winter Park, Florida. He studied from 1886 to 1890 at Rollins College. After attending an engineering school in Philadelphia for a year, he transferred to Drexel University. For some time he worked in Florida and briefly worked in Baltimore. From October 1895 to June 1896 he worked at Drexel University as an instructor in chemistry and a laboratory assistant in both chemistry and physics. In June 1896, Lewton became an economic botanist at the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. There he investigated over 500 specimens of gums and resins to determine their chemical compositions, solubilities, and botanical affiliations. This research was published in German and American scientific journals. Lewton and his first wife, Emilie Hempel Lewton (1875‚Äì1929), were married for thirty years and had four daughters. He and his second wife moved to Florida. From 1954 until his death in 1959 he worked as a part-time archivist and historian at Rollins College.

It was developed by Emerald Software and published by Grandslam Entertainments for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. Gameplay The Running Man is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game based on the 1987 film of the same name. Set in Los Angeles in 2019, the player takes control of former policeman Ben Richards, who was framed for the murder of innocent civilians. He is chosen by host Damon Killian to compete for his survival on the television game show known as The Running Man. The player can crawl, kick, and run. The game is played across five levels, each one featuring a primary enemy. The first four enemies are \\"stalkers,\\" who are tasked with killing Richards. As in the film, the stalkers include Subzero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, and Fireball. The final enemy is Killian, who is confronted by Richards in the TV studio. Other enemies throughout the game include dogs and guards. Energy can be regained by kicking the dogs. In between levels is a time-limited puzzle game, which restores full energy if it is solved. The puzzle game presents two images side by side, with the left one being jumbled. The player is tasked with arranging the image on the left side to match the image shown on the right. Development and release The Running Man was developed by Emerald Software and published by Grandslam Entertainments. The game includes an introduction sequence that makes use of digitized images. The sequence is set before Richards starts The Running Man as he tells Killian \\"I'll be back\\", suggesting he will succeed in surviving the game. The Amiga version of the game was released as a two-disk set, with the introduction sequence getting its own disk of the two. For the ZX Spectrum version, each character has a minimum of 20 frames, and some use up to 30; to overcome memory constraints, special encryption methods were used. The game was released in Europe in 1989, for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (C64), and ZX Spectrum. Reception Tony Dillon of Commodore User wrote that the game \\"is fun for a while. But behind all the glitz is still a run of the mill beat em' up.\\" Julian Rignall of Computer and Video Games also considered it \\"a barely average beat 'em up\\", expressing disappointment with the game considering its film license. Gordon Hamlett of Your Amiga considered it a \\"substandard\\" beat 'em up, while Zzap!64 stated that the game consisted of \\"repetitive beat-'em up action with very few moves to choose from.\\" Crash praised the game and considered it to be a good film tie-in, while mentioning its difficulty, particularly during the puzzle aspect. Mark Higham of ST/Amiga Format stated that because the game has only five levels, \\"the whole thing can get ridiculously hard ridiculously quickly.\\" Rignall also criticized the difficulty, writing that the first two opponents \\"are relatively easy, and then the difficulty is hoisted right up and the third one is very difficult to beat, resulting in frustration and annoyance.\\" Hamlett wrote that when a dog knocks the player down and inflicts damage, \\"there is a fair chance that it will turn and do the same again before you have a chance to respond.\\" Some were critical that only a small portion of the screen is used for gameplay. The graphics received some praise, along with the sound. The game's introduction sequence was mostly praised. Dillon wrote that it was \\"probably the most impressive part of the game,\\" calling it \\"nothing short of amazing.\\" Rignall considered the sequence to be among the best he had seen on a computer, but wrote that \\"from then on things go downhill alarmingly swiftly.\\" Zzap!64 criticized the game's \\"dull\\" graphics and wrote, \\"Following the impressive intro sequence the game itself comes as something of a disappointment.\\" Higham felt that the graphics and gameplay speed needed improvement, writing, \\"An opening sequence of brilliant sampled music and digitised pictures just isn't enough to sustain your interest when you get into the game.\\" Several critics disliked the controls and sluggish gameplay. Reviewing the Amiga version, The Games Machine wrote, \\"The makings of a good game are there, but they have been spoiled by frustrating gameplay and poor control.\\" The Games Machine later wrote that the Atari ST version \\"plays just as badly as the Amiga game.\\" The magazine stated that the ZX Spectrum version had slightly improved control but negatively noted that it was still the same basic game. Hamlett criticized the Amiga version for its poor joystick response. Zzap!64 stated that the C64 version had slightly better playability than the Amiga version but that it was just as sluggish.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also: list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States. __NOTOC__  Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are re-purposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986‚Äì2001, 2002‚Äì2009, and 2010‚Äì2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation- reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1994: * 1994 In January, a pipeline ruptured, dumping almost of oil in a river, the Marais des Cygnes River in Osawatomie, Kansas. In addition to a $804,700 fine, BP Amoco agreed to spend at least $145,300 on a supplemental environmental project involving reconstruction improvements to Osawatomie's water intake. * 1994 On January 16, a pipeline burst, at a tank farm in Saint Louis, Missouri, spilling gasoline during a transfer operation. The company knew that some gasoline was missing, but, waited until January 18 to confirm and report the loss. About 240,000 gallons of gasoline was spilled, with about 100,000 gallons entering the Mississippi River. * 1994 The January 17 Northridge earthquake caused a crude oil pipeline to crack near Piru, California, spilling about 173,000 gallons of crude into the Santa Clara River. The cleanup took more than 600 workers six weeks to complete and cost more than $14 million. * 1994 On February 1, the third explosion in 7 years hit a LPG/NGL pipeline Terminal in Iowa City, Iowa. 11 workers at the Terminal escaped injury, and 6 families within 1 1/2 miles of the Terminal were evacuated. The 2 previous explosions were in 1987 and 1989. * Edison, New Jersey natural gas explosion: March 23, 1994, previous damage caused a 36-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline to rupture at Edison, New Jersey. Several apartment buildings and a number of automobiles were destroyed in the massive fire. One woman died of a heart attack, and at least 93 others had minor injuries. Delays in shutting off one of the pipeline's valves was cited as contributing to the damage. * 1994 On May 8, a Sunoco pipeline leaked gasoline in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, forcing the evacuation of 50 homes. About 537 barrels of gasoline were spilled. * 1994 On June 2, a Koch Industries pipeline spilled gasoline in Wichita, Kansas. About 79,000 galons were spilled, and, some of it caused interruptions in local water supply. * 1994 A 2-inch steel gas service line that had been exposed during excavation separated at a compression coupling about from the wall of a retirement home in Allentown, Pennsylvania on June 9. The escaping gas flowed underground, passed through openings in the building foundation, migrated to other floors, and exploded. The accident resulted in 1 fatality, 66 injuries, and more than $5 million in property damage. * 1994 A resident near O'Fallon, Missouri detected a petroleum smell, early on September 22. The local Fire Department was called several hours later, and noticed an oily mist in the area, and found a leaking pipeline. The owner of the 10-inch petroleum products later claimed the spill volume was less than , but later calculations and batch volume measurements indicate a spill of 29,000 to . EPA officials later admit someone lied about the spill volume. Over the next 10 years, 8 attempts at remediation were made, before the O'Day Creek was cleaned of all petroleum products. * 1994 On October 8, a lightning strike shut a valve on a Koch Industries crude oil pipeline crossing Gum Hollow Creek, while oil was flowing, triggering a pressure buildup that ripped a 50-square-inch hole in a section of the pipe that was already weakened by corrosion. Pipeline employees ‚Äî unaware of the rupture in the pipe ‚Äî turned the pipeline pumps back on after the pipeline shut down automatically, sending oil pouring into the creek for about an hour. The spill created a -long slick on Nueces and Corpus Christi bays along the Texas Gulf Coast. Nearly seven years later, delicate coastal marshes that serve as a nursery for shrimp, flounder, crabs and other marine life had not fully recovered. The estimated spill size was , but that was debated as being too small a size. The pipeline eventually agreed to pay more than $45 million in damages. Koch reported to PHMSA that the spill cost zero dollars in property damage. * 1994 In October, record high flooding along the San Jacinto River in Texas lead to the failure of 8 pipelines crossing that river. Due to the flooding many other pipelines were also undermined. More than of petroleum and petroleum products were released into the river. Ignition of the released products resulted in 547 people receiving (mostly minor) burn and inhalation injuries. Spill response costs exceeded $7 million, and estimated property damage losses were about $16 million. * 1994 A natural gas explosion and fire destroyed a one-story, wood frame building in Waterloo, Iowa on October 17. The force of the explosion scattered debris over a radius. 6 persons inside the building died, and one person sustained serious injuries. 3 persons working in an adjacent building sustained minor injuries when a wall of the building collapsed inward from the force of the explosion. The explosion also damaged nine parked cars. A person in a vehicle who had just exited the adjacent building suffered minor injuries. Additionally, two firefighters sustained minor injuries during the emergency response. Two other nearby buildings also sustained structural damage and broken windows. * 1994 On November 21, a Buckeye Partners pipeline ruptured from incorrect operation in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. About 38,000 gallons of kerosene were spilled. * 1994 A leak of at least of diesel fuel was discovered on a Koch Industries pipeline near Plover, Wisconsin on November 29. The leak brought this pipeline's total spill volume to on a pipeline section through several years.

Until the first mass demonstrations in June, protests were focused on the withdrawal of the extradition bill. In June, protesters started to lay out five demands. The additional four demands concerned the reactions of the Hong Kong government and especially, the police to the protests, and called more broadly for full democracy in the city. The first protest against the bill took place on 15 March. Two subsequent protests on 31 March and 28 April witnessed a sharp increase in the number of attendants, which the organizers claimed as 130,000 for the 28 April protest. As the Hong Kong government around Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed for a speedy second reading of the bill, the protests dramatically increased in size, with estimates of protester numbers being over one million for the protests on 9 June, and up to two million ‚Äì more than a quarter of the city's population ‚Äì for those on 16 June. By that time, protests had started to change their focus to include the alleged excessive use of violence by police against protesters, which had marred the late-night end of the 9 June protest, and which was drawing further international attention during the 12 June siege of the Legislative Council Building by the protesters. On that day, the protesters achieved a partial success when the second reading of the bill was halted indefinitely. The full reversal of the police characterization of the 12 June violence as \\"riots\\" would become one of the five demands. Protesters also tried to draw international attention to their cause by protesting on occasion of the G20 summit in Osaka at the end of the month. The city would see further increases in protest activity and the violence levels at the annual 1 July march when the Legislative Council building was stormed by protesters, and in the following several months.  Prelude  = Before 31 March = Before the first large-scale demonstration (in terms of numbers) took place on 31 March, Demosist≈ç held a sit-in protest event at the Central Government Complex on 15 March. = 31 March demonstration = The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), a platform for 50 pro- democracy groups, launched its first protest march against the bill on 31 March, from Southorn Playground in Wan Chai to the Central Government Complex in Admiralty. Claudia Mo, pro-democracy camp's convener, and Lam Wing-kee, the owner of Causeway Bay Books who had been kidnapped by Chinese agents in 2015, led the rally. High-profile democracy activists, like Cardinal Joseph Zen, barristers Martin Lee and Margaret Ng, and Apple Daily owner Jimmy Lai, also attended the rally. Organisers claimed 12,000 people took part in the march, while police put the peak figure at 5,200. = 28 April march = alt=a large procession along the east-bound carriageway of a road through a built-up area; severe traffic congestion in the westbound carriageway The second protest march against the extradition bill began at East Point Road, Causeway Bay and headed to the Legislative Council in Admiralty. The march lasted over four hours. While police estimated 22,800 protesters, organisers claimed 130,000 participants. The latter figure was the highest since the estimated 510,000 that organisers claimed joined the annual 1 July protest in 2014. The next day, Chief Executive Carrie Lam remained adamant that the bill would be enacted and said the Legislative councillors had to pass the new extradition laws before their summer break. Lam said Chan Tong-kai, the suspect in the Murder of Poon Hiu-wing, could be out of prison by October, hence the urgency of passing the extradition bill. Although Chan received a prison sentence on 29 April, Secretary for Security John Lee expected that Chan could be free to leave Hong Kong early for good behaviour. = May = On 4 May, a rally was held in a demonstration area outside the Legislative Council. About 300 people attended the rally in support of the democrats. While the democrats received vocal support in the chants, members of the pro-establishment camp were booed. On the evening of 10 March, rallies in the Legislative Council in opposition to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance amendment and in solidarity with an overnight stay in the conference room of the Legislative Council pro-democracy members, about 1,000 people attended. On 11 May, a fight broke out in Hong Kong's legislature on Saturday as pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to China discussed the extradition law that would extend Beijing's powers over the financial hub. On the evening of 13 May, the FDC and demonstrators stayed outside the Legislative Council overnight. There were 30 members of the public in solidarity with the democrats. There was a quarrel with security. = 4-5 June Hilltop vertical protest banners = Hong Kong is one of a few places that still commemorate those who died in the Tienanmen Square conflict. On this 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tienanmen Square Massacre, someone put a yellow \\"Dare Not Forget June Fourth\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂÖ≠Âõõ„Äç) vertical protest banner over Beacon Hill. The day after the \\"Never Forget June Fourth\\" banner, yet another 15-meter vertical protest banner was erected over Devil's Peak. This banner stated in Chinese \\"Lam Sold Hong Kong; Resign!\\" („ÄåÊûóÈÑ≠Ë≥£Ê∏Ø‰∏ãÂè∞ÔºÅ„Äç) in black font over yellow fabric. = 6 June lawyers' silent march/Before protest = left Legal professionals concerned about the extradition bill also staged a silent march on 6 June. In black attire, lawyers, legal academics and law students marched from the Court of Final Appeal to the Central Government Offices. Dennis Kwok, Legislative Councillor for the Legal constituency, and Martin Lee and Denis Chang, two former Hong Kong Bar Association chairmen, led the march. The group of lawyers stood silently in front of government headquarters for three minutes. Kwok said, \\"We shall not bow our heads [to the government]\\". More than 3,000 lawyers, representing around one-quarter of the city's legal professionals, attended the march ‚Äì the fifth and largest protest march held by lawyers in Hong Kong since 1997. While the protesting lawyers expressed reservations about openness and fairness of the justice system in China, Secretary Lee had previously said the legal sector did not really understand the bill and some had not read the bill before protesting. A 50-meter yellow vertical banner was seen on Lion Rock displaying in black font \\"No Extradition To PR China\\" and its Chinese equivalent, „ÄåÂèçÈÄÅ‰∏≠„Äç.  Tensions heightened  = 9 June protest =  Daytime rally  Before the government tabled the extradition bill's second reading in the Legislative Council on 12 June, the CHRF had called Hong Kong people to march against the bill on 9 June through an approximately 3 km (1.86 mi) route from Victoria Park to the Legislative Council in Admiralty. Police ordered MTR to bypass Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Tin Hau stations for several hours. Protesters exited at Fortress Hill to join the protest. Police urged protesters to start off before the official 3 pm start-time to ease overcrowding; police were forced to open up all lanes on Hennessy Road, having previously refused to do so. A significant number of protesters were still leaving Victoria Park up to four hours after the start time, and were still arriving at the end-point at 10 pm. Reports suggested it could have been the largest ever, and certainly the largest protest Hong Kong has seen since the 1997 handover, surpassing the turnout seen at mass rallies in support of the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and 1 July demonstration of 2003. CHRF convenor Jimmy Sham said that 1.03 million people attended the march, while the police put the crowd at 240,000 at its peak.  Night-time clashes  Hundreds of protesters camped in front of the government headquarters well into the night, with more joining them in response to calls from Demosist≈ç and pro-independence activists. Police formed a human chain to prevent protesters from entering Harcourt Road, the main road next to government headquarters, while Special Tactical Squad (STS) was on standby. Although the CHRF had officially called an end to the march at 10 pm, around 100 protesters remained at Civic Square. alt= At 11 pm, the government issued a press statement, saying it \\"acknowledge[s] and respect[s] that people have different views on a wide range of issues\\", but insisted the second reading debate on the bill would resume on 12 June. In response, several members of Demosist≈ç staged a sit-in outside the Legislative Council Complex demanding a dialogue with Lam and Lee, while pro-independence groups Student Localism and the Students Independent Union, called for escalating protest actions if the government failed to withdraw the bill. Around midnight, when a permission of protesters expired, police moved in to clear protesters who had planned to stay outside the Central Government Complex until 12 June. Tensions escalated and clashes broke out between protesters and officers at the Legislative Council Complex. Protesters threw bottles and metal barricades at police and pushed barricades while officers responded with pepper spray. Riot police pushed back against the crowd and secured the area, while police on Harcourt Road also pushed protesters back onto the pavements. Clashes shifted to Lung Wo Road as many protesters gathered and barricaded themselves from the officers. Several hundred protesters were herded by officers towards Lung King Street in Wan Chai around 2 am and then into Gloucester Road. Police hemmed in the last pockets of protesters in the early morning outside the old Wan Chai police station. By the end of the clearance, 19 protesters had been arrested while 358, who had been corralled along the wall of the Old Wan Chai Police Station by a large number of officers, had their profiles recorded; 80 percent of them were younger than 25. The next morning, Lam refused to withdraw the bill but acknowledged that the sizeable rally showed there were \\"clearly still concerns\\" over the bill. Pressed about whether she would resign, she asserted it was important to have a stable governing team \\"when our economy is going to undergo some very severe challenges because of external uncertainties.\\" = 12 June ‚Äì strike and siege of LegCo = Online groups called on people to \\"picnic\\" on the morning of 12 June at Tamar Park. A general strike had been called for 12 June, the day of the planned resumption of the second reading of the extradition bill. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) appealed to workers to join the protest; hundreds of businesses closed for the day and numerous workers went on strike. Protesters attempted to stall the second reading of the extradition bill. Around 8 am, the crowd rushed onto Harcourt Road, blocking traffic. Lung Wo Road and surrounding streets were also blocked by the protesters in a scene reminiscent of 2014 Occupy protests. Around 11 am, the Legislative Council Secretariat announced that the second reading debate on the extradition bill had been postponed indefinitely. Around 3:20 pm, protesters on Tim Wa Avenue began to charge the police barricades and were doused with pepper spray in reply. Protesters also attempted to charge the Legislative Council building. Riot police dispersed the protesters by firing tear gas, beanbag rounds and rubber bullets. There was a stand-off on Harcourt Road between protesters and the police. As of 6 pm, 22 injured people had been sent to public hospitals. At around 6:20 pm, the Legislative Council Secretariat issued a circular saying Legislative Council President Andrew Leung had called off the meeting. Protesters remained in the streets outside the AIA Tower in Central, Queensway outside Pacific Place shopping mall, and at the junction of Arsenal Street and Hennessy Road in Wan Chai into the night. By the end of the day, at least 79 protesters and police officers had been treated in hospitals; around 150 tear gas canisters, \\"several\\" rounds of rubber bullets, and 20 beanbag shots had been fired during the protest clearance. According to the CHRF, the police had earlier agreed to peaceful demonstration within the area outside CITIC Tower in its letter of no objection. However, teargas was fired by police, to some criticism. As people trickled through the jammed central revolving door and a small side door, the police fired another two tear gas canisters into the trapped crowd fuelling panic. Amnesty International also criticised the use of tear gas against the trapped crowd. Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo declared the clashes a \\"riot\\" and condemned the protesters' behaviour. Speaking in Cantonese, Lo used the term for \\"disturbance\\", but a police spokesman later clarified he meant \\"riot\\". Chief Executive Carrie Lam backed Lo, saying the protesters' \\"dangerous and life-threatening acts\\" had devolved into a \\"blatant, organised riot\\". The police have been criticised for its excessive use of force, including the misuse of rubber bullets, police batons, tear gas and riot control agents. The Special Tactical Squad deployed also lacked visible identification. Amnesty concluded that the use of force by police against the largely peaceful protest was unnecessary and excessive and that police had \\"violated international human rights law and standards.\\" It was also criticised for assaulting, insulting and ignoring the safety of journalists, and conducting arrests inside hospitals and accessing patients' medical documents without consent. = 14 June mothers' sit-in = Following an interview of Carrie Lam on TVB in the morning of 12 June in which she lamented that as a mother, she would not have tolerated her children's violent protests, a group of women barristers and scholars from Chinese University launched an online petition stating that \\"the people of Hong Kong are not your children\\" and admonished her for attacking their children with tear gas, rubber bullets or bag bombs.\\" Some 6,000 people participated in a three-hour sit-in at Chater Garden in Central on the evening of 14 June. The protesters dressed in black and holding carnations, called on Carrie Lam to step down and for the government to retract the bill. They also held up placards condemning police brutality, such as \\"don't shoot our kids.\\" The organisers also said they had collected more than 44,000 signatures in a petition condemning the views Lam expressed in the interview. = 15 June Hilltop vertical protest banner = A new phrase on a 30-meter vertical banner was seen on Lion Rock at around 6 am. The fabric was yellow, but this time a few of the words were printed red. The banner demanded \\"Safeguard Hong Kong\\" („Äå‰øùË°ûÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç) in Chinese, with the word \\"safeguard\\" in red, followed by an English phrase \\"Fight for HK\\" with the word \\"fight\\" in red. = 16 June march = On 15 June, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a pause in the passage of the extradition bill after the Legislative Council meetings had been postponed for four working days in a row. The pro-democracy camp feared it was merely a tactical retreat and demanded a full withdrawal of the bill and said they would go ahead with the 16 June rally as planned. Jimmy Sham, convenor of the CHRF, said the suspension could be a trap. They also called for Lam's resignation, apology for \\"disproportionally violent\\" police tactics towards peaceful protesters, the release of arrested protesters, and to withdraw the official characterisation of the protest on 12 June as \\"riot\\". The march started ahead of time, at 2:30 pm on 16 June, from Victoria Park, Causeway Bay, to the Legislative Council in Admiralty ‚Äì an approximately route. Slogan-chanting protesters were predominantly dressed in black, some wearing white ribbons on their chests in anger at police brutality during the 12 June crackdown. Many protesters started their march from North Point as the police ordered the MTR not to stop at Tin Hau and Causeway Bay during the march. Nearby train stations were swamped with hundreds of thousands pouring into the protest zone; those from the Kowloon side trying to join the protest had to wait up to an hour at a time to board cross-harbour Star Ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui. The size of the crowd forced police to open all the six lanes of Hennessy Road; the masses then also spilled over onto Lockhart Road and Jaffe Road ‚Äì all three being parallel streets and major thoroughfares in Wan Chai. Protesters making way for an ambulance on Queensway at night. The procession from Causeway Bay to Admiralty lasted from 3 pm to 11 pm. Marchers left bouquets and slogans on the site in front of Pacific Place where a man had committed suicide on 15 June. At night, protesters blocked Harcourt Road, causing traffic to grind to a halt. Protesters, however, allowed trapped vehicles ‚Äì mainly franchised buses and emergency vehicles ‚Äì to pass. Early in the afternoon, Stand News, an independent online news agency, had used big data analysis to predict that there is a 72% chance that 1.44 million would have participated in the protest. The CHRF claimed the final turnout at \\"almost 2 million plus 1 citizens\\", which set the record of the largest protest in Hong Kong history. The police said that there were 338,000 marchers on the original route at its peak. At 8:30 pm, the government issued a statement in which Carrie Lam apologised to Hong Kong residents and promised to \\"sincerely and humbly accept all criticism and to improve and serve the public.\\" = 21 and 24 June police HQ sieges = A loose association of university-based protest groups, officially known as the Student's Unions of Higher Institutions, reiterated its four main as-yet unaddressed demands after not receiving any official response from the government. Further protests were called on 21 June. At around 11 am, protesters gathered outside government headquarters and quickly blocked the traffic on Harcourt Road. Some of the protesters also marched to Hong Kong Police Headquarters in Wan Chai as Demosist≈ç activist Joshua Wong, who was released from prison only a few days earlier after serving a sentence for his actions in the 2014 protests, urged the crowd to surround the complex. Dozens of protesters also staged a sit-in at the Revenue Tower and Immigration Tower nearby. Another round of blockade occurred three days later, on 24 June. On 26 June, protesters returned to the Revenue Tower to apologise to civil servants for the earlier disruption. By the evening of 21 June, a siege had developed at the Police Headquarters as thousands of protesters amassed in Arsenal Street. South China Morning Post reported that protesters had \\"blocked the police headquarters' exits, threw eggs at the compound, drew graffiti on the walls, covered closed-circuit television cameras with tape, splashed oil on officers and targeted laser beams at police officers' eyes\\". The police took no action to disperse the protesters. The police sought medical attention for some staff members and had made a total of five ambulance calls by 9:33 pm. After the ambulance's arrival, the medics waited for tens of minutes in front of the gate of the police headquarter for the police to unlock it. The siege ended peacefully at 2:40 am as most of the protesters had left. Staff members and officers trapped inside the building evacuated via a back entrance to board waiting for coaches. The police blamed the protesters for the delayed treatment, though Hong Kong Fire Services Department stated that the protesters did not obstruct any rescue effort by the paramedics.

Around 1,500 protesters during the day visited the consulates of countries expected to attend the G20 Osaka summit, handing out petitions to raise awareness of the movement in hopes of putting pressure on China. Meanwhile, there were solidarity protests in Osaka, Japan during the G20 Summit. China said it would not tolerate any discussion at the forum because \\"Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair to China [in which] no foreign country has a right to interfere.\\" In the evening, thousands gathered for a rally outside the City Hall, shouting slogans of freedom and democracy. The protests stretched to the International Finance Centre, and spilled over into Lung Wo Road, blocking westbound traffic during the evening rush hour. Thousands of protesters then assembled at Edinburgh Place at night, holding signs that read \\"Democracy now\\" and \\"Free Hong Kong.\\" At the same time, around 1,000 protesters surrounded the Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours. A white \\"Release All Activists\\" („ÄåÈáãÊîæÁæ©Â£´„Äç) vertical protest banner was hung at the entrance of the Hong Kong Police Headquarter demanding the release of protesters unjustly detained or arrested.

In light of the protests on 27 June, Au Nok-hin's resolutions and Eddie Chu's proposal to delay the surrendering date were halted as pro-Beijing legislator Christopher Cheung requested an adjournment for debate to shift attention on restoring peace in Hong Kong. Chu and protesters entered the pier at around 11:30 pm. Protesters left the pier at midnight when its jurisdiction was legally turned over to PLA, though a standoff between the protesters and the police continued till 1 am.  Counter-demonstrations  On 9 June, Around 20 supporters from the Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-Beijing activist group showed up at the government quarters to support the bill a few hours before the anti- extradition bill protest. On 16 June, around 40 protesters from the pro- Beijing Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance and the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKFTU) protested outside the U.S. Consulate General in Central, condemning the US for allegedly interfering in the extradition law. Hundreds of Pro-Beijing supporters gathered in Chater Garden in Central under the banner \\"Support Hong Kong Police Force, Blessing to Hong Kong\\" on 22 June; pro-Beijing figures such as legislator Priscilla Leung and pro-police campaigner Leticia Lee fronted the rally. On 30 June, a more significant demonstration was organised by pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu to show solidarity for the police and support for the extradition bill, taking place in front of the government headquarters in Tamar. Former police chief Tang King-shing and former deputy police commissioner (brother of actor Simon Yam) took to the podium, as did artists such as Alan Tam and Tony Leung. The organisers claimed that 165,000 people attended, while police cited 53,000. There were multiple confrontations as the pro-police supporters ran into small groups of anti-bill protesters wearing black, getting into arguments and scuffles with them as well with journalists covering the event. The Lennon Wall in Admiralty was destroyed by the pro-police supporters and pan- democratic Legislative Councillor Lam Cheuk-ting was physically assaulted.

This power outage went viral on Twitter and other social media. Areas affected Areas affected by power cuts include the Greater Jakarta area including Jakarta, Banten, West Java, parts of Special Region of Yogyakarta, Central Java and East Java. In West Java, areas affected by the power cuts included Bandung, Bekasi, Cianjur, Cimahi, Cirebon, Garut, Karawang, Purwakarta, Majalaya, Sumedang, Tasikmalaya, Depok, Gunung Putri, Sukabumi, and Bogor. In Banten, the area affected was Cilegon. Cause Perusahaan Listrik Negara (The State Electricity Company) initially cited the reason for power outages as disruptions in gas turbines 1 to 6 at the Suralaya Power Plant and some other disruptions at the Cilegon Power Plant. PLN then corrected the reason by citing a disturbance on the transmission side of Ungaran and Pemalang 500 kV which resulted in energy transfers from east to west failing. PLN expressed its apology regarding this. Impact The blackout began at 11:50 local time, when Jakarta MRT authorities began to detect the loss of electrical supply, rendering its trains inoperable and requiring people stuck inside to evacuate. Jakarta LRT and KRL Commuterline also suffered from the blackout making TransJakarta the only mass transit transportation remaining in operation at the time of the blackout. The governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan made TransJakarta and Jakarta MRT services free of charge until the end of the day. In the telecommunications sector, the telephone network was also been disrupted. Disrupted networks included Telkomsel, Indosat, XL Axiata, 3, and Smartfren. Gojek and Grab had problems due to the lack of internet services. Around 21.3 million people were affected by the power outage. The blackout lasted around 9 hours where at 21:00 local time, power to most of the affected areas has been restored. Power to some rural and residential areas in Jakarta had not been restored past midnight. Some areas initially had electricity backed up by midnight or later, only to have its electricity cut off again. A police officer managing traffic when the electricity went out in Bekasi Most of the traffic lights of Jakarta stopped functioning. At least eight fires occurred on Sunday night and Monday morning in eight different locations due to the power outage. This probably had happened due to the use of candles as lighting during the power outage.

He was a son-in-law of the mesazon George Palaiologos. In 1453 he was governor of Leontari in Arcadia, but in the Morea revolt of 1453‚Äì1454 he fought against the Despot Thomas Palaiologos, was defeated and blinded. In 1459, during the civil war between Thomas Palaiologos and his brother and co-despot, Demetrios Palaiologos, Bochalis sided with the latter. Along with his father-in-law he captured Leontari, the capital of Thomas Palaiologos, but was forced to abandon the town, incurring many casualties, once Thomas arrived with his army. During the Ottoman invasion of the Despotate in 1460, Bochalis led the defence of Gardiki Castle, where the inhabitants of Leontari had fled. When the Ottomans arrived, Sultan Mehmed II offered terms, but Bochalis rejected them. However, the crowd of refugees, some 6,000, made a prolonged resistance impossible: in the extreme heat of summer, water and supplies were quickly consumed, and after only a day of resistance to the Ottoman assault, Bochalis surrendered in exchange for promises of safety. Despite the promise to not harm, them, Mehmed ordered all defenders, including women and children, executed. Bochalis and his family were saved thanks to the intervention of Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá, who was second cousin to Bochalis' wife. With Mahmud's aid, Bochalis and his family, including his father-in-law George Palaiologos, were escorted away, killed their Ottoman guards and escaped to Corfu, from where they moved to the Kingdom of Naples.On the later members of the family, who became stradioti in Venetian service, see During the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, Bochalis returned to fight for the Republic of Venice in the Morea, but was captured in 1468 by the Ottomans at Kalamata and executed by impalement.

Discovered in 1888, it is one of the longest and most elaborate surviving graffiti texts from the town, and may be the only known love poem from one woman to another from the Latin world. Inscription Map of the regions of Pompeii. CIL 4.5296 was found in region nine (IX), in the centre of the town. CIL 4.5296 was discovered in 1888 by Italian archaeologists excavating the Roman town of Pompeii, scratched into the wall of the hallway of house six of insula nine, in region nine of the town. The poem was first published by Antonio Sogliano in that year's excavation report. The poem is inscribed over seven lines of text, in a neat hand, with the words divided by interpuncts. The inscription is written carefully inside the decoratively painted borders of a wall panel. It is followed by three words written in a different hand, which cross the painted border. Several other short inscriptions were found on the same wall, below CIL 4.5396, in larger letters. The slab of plaster on which the inscription is preserved with four other pieces of graffiti is in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum, Naples. It measures 74 x 38 cm. Poem The text is one of the longest and most elaborate pieces of graffiti to survive from Pompeii. Though inscribed over seven lines of text, the poem is metrically nine verses long, with the final verse unfinished. It is unknown why the poem ends mid-verse: perhaps the author was interrupted, or could not remember the end of the poem. =Metre= The meter is somewhat irregular: three verses are correct hexameters, and the text may originally have been made up entirely of hexameters, or a mixture of hexameters and pentameters. The first verse of the poem scans correctly as a hexameter; verses two and three can be easily emended to read as a pentameter and hexameter respectively. If the poem were composed in elegiac couplets, verse four should again be a pentameter; it is easier, however, to emend it so it reads as a hexameter, suggesting the poem was not originally in regular elegiac couplets. Kristina Milnor suggests that the reason for the erratic pattern of what were apparently originally pentametrical and hexametrical lines is if CIL 4.5296 is made up of verses from two or more different poems stitched together to make a new composition. This form of composition is known from other graffiti from Pompeii: for instance CIL 4.9847, a two line inscription made up of one hexameter verse from Ovid's Amores and one from Propertius I.1. =Text= The text of CIL 4.5296 is relatively clear, though there is some disagreement about the interpretation of the word in verse six. In his initial publication of the poem, Sogliano emended the word to , and Kristina Milnor argues that is correct as a non-deponent form of . However, Luca Graverini argues that the word order suggests that the verb in the sentence should be in the first person, agreeing with (\\"I\\") in verse five, but is in the second person; additionally, in verse five is in the past tense, and so the next verb probably would be also. Alternatively, August Mau's suggestion of is widely accepted by scholars, though this leaves the sentence without a main verb. =Interpretation= The poem as it is preserved in the Pompeii inscription is written in the voice of a woman (identified by the feminine in verse 5), addressed to another woman (, \\"my little darling\\", in verse 3). As the poem is usually interpreted as a love poem, many scholars have attempted to find a way of interpreting either the speaker or the beloved as a man rather than a woman. Equally, many scholars have argued that the poem was neither composed by a female author, nor inscribed by a woman: Milnor cites G.P. Goold for what she identifies as the traditional view of the poem's authorship: \\"with the realization that the graffito does not reflect a real- life situation disappears all likelihood that it was composed or inscribed by a girl\\"., cited in Graverini, however, argues that the \\"most reasonable assumption\\" is that the poem's author was a woman. The first three verses of the poem focus on the beloved, and comment on her individual body-parts: her \\"little arms\\" and \\"tender little lips\\" (). The use of diminutives in this section is reminiscent of Catullus, and the only other literary source of the word is in Catullus 61. The end of this sentence is marked by both the end of verse three, and the end of line two of the inscription. The next section of the poem is more sombre in tone and changes its focus to the lover lying awake, a well-known trope of ancient love poetry, appearing in, for example, the midnight poem often attributed to Sappho, Ovid's Amores and Ars amatoria, and other Pompeian graffiti such as . The claim in verse 4 that \\"the nature of men is fickle\\" is an inversion of a common theme in love poetry: almost always it is women who are so condemned. The poem then addresses the fickleness of fortune; another common trope. This provides a link to the final lines of the poem, which address the instability of love. The poem has often been seen as a paraklausithyron - a form of love poem where the lover laments the door that separates them from their beloved. Frank Olin Copley described the poem as \\"in the manner of a paraclausithyron\\" in 1939, and many scholars have followed him in this identification. Graverini disputes this, arguing that the content of the poem does not support this conclusion (since the poem mentions neither anything physically keeping the lovers apart, nor contains a plea to be let in to visit the beloved; the two \\"most distinctive features\\" of the paraklausithyron) and the context of the inscription actively counts against it, because the earliest reports on the inscription describe it as being inside the door, while the paraklausithyron interpretation relies on it having been found outside. paries quid ama Fresco of Pyramus and Thisbe from the House of Loreius Tiburtinus in Pompeii The eighth line of the inscription, apparently written in a different hand, has attracted several different readings. In the Corpus Inscriptionem Latinarum, it is transcribed as \\"AARIIIIS QVID AAM\\". Matteo Della Corte suggests that the line should be read \\"Marius quidam\\" (\\"Some Marius\\"), as a fake signature to the poem. Sogliano and Franz B√ºcheler both print \\"paries quid ama\\", and Graverini and Milnor both accept this reading, suggesting that it derives from a line from Ovid's version of the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in his Metamorphoses : \\"'invide' dicebant 'paries, quid amantibus obstans?'\\" (\\"'Jealous wall', they said, 'why are you standing between these lovers?'\\").

Early life Drummond was born on 21 July 1742 at Largs in Scotland as Thomas Lundin.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, vol. VII, Edinburgh 1910, p. 57-59 He was the second of three sons born to James Lundin (1707‚Äì1781) and the former Lady Rachel Bruce (d. 1769), a daughter of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Kincardine. His elder sister, Veronica Drummond, married Duncan Campbell of Kames, and his younger brother, was James Drummond, 1st Baron Perth. The Lundins descended from Thomas de Lundin, a natural son of King William the Lion. Thomas' paternal grandparents were Robert Lundin (1675‚Äì1716) and Anne Inglis (a daughter of Sir James Inglis of Cramond). His grandfather Robert was a younger son of John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort (younger son of the 3rd Earl of Perth) by his first wife, Sophia Maitland. Sophia, his great-grandmother, had inherited Lundin from her brother John Lundin of Lundin, both children of Margaret (n√©e Lundin) Maitland and Robert Maitland (a younger son of John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale). Sophia's mother Margaret had inherited the Lundin estates upon the death of her father, John Lundin of Lundin, in 1684. =Claim to the Earldom of Perth= On 6 February 1760, following the death of Edward Drummond, sixth Jacobite-jurisdiction Duke of Perth, Thomas' father became heir to the Earldom of Perth, which had been forfeit since 1716 owing to the attainder of James Drummond, 2nd Duke of Perth (The first Earl of Melfort was the younger son of James Drummond, 3rd Earl of Perth). His father, therefore, assumed the surname of Drummond and styled himself 10th Earl of Perth, after which Thomas became known as Lord Drummond, and in 1776, following the death of Jean Drummond, Duchess of Perth in 1773, his father took up residence at the Drummond estate of Stobhall in Perthshire. Career In 1768, Lord Drummond first came to America from Scotland to defend his family's rights to lands in the Province of New Jersey, namely those of the Earl of Melfort in Perth Amboy. Due to his many influential friends on both sides of the Atlantic, he took on the role of intermediary between the colonies and England during the American Revolution. In late December 1775, Lord Drummond arrived in Philadelphia with his plan for reconciliation. During the first two weeks of January, he discussed his plan with sympathetic members of the Continental Congress, which included Thomas Lynch.Smith, Paul H. et al., eds. Letters of Delegates to Congress, 1774‚Äì1789. 26 vols. Washington, D.C., 1976‚Äì2000. His plan was based on conversations in England, between December 1774 and September 1775, with Lord North, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and Lord Dartmouth, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and First Lord of Trade, and American moderates in New York during the fall of 1774. While Drummond did not claim the British government had officially authorized his plan, he implied to members of Congress that Lord North knew of, and approved, his plan. By January 1776, Congressman Lynch was poised to propose formal negotiations in line with Drummond's suggestions, but news of the American defeat at the Battle of Quebec weakened the American negotiating position and led to increased hostilities toward the British. In early February 1776, Drummond and Lynch met in New York in an attempt to revive the stalled peace negotiations, however, General George Washington's refused to cooperate, which led to the failure of Drummond's peace mission by early March.Klein, Milton M. Failure of a Mission: The Drummond Peace Proposal of 1775. Huntington Library Quarterly 35 (1971‚Äì72): pps. 343‚Äì80. After the failure of the peace plan, Drummond served as an adviser to Gen. William Howe, the Commander-in-Chief, North America for the British Army, before his return to England in November 1778. Personal life Lord Drummond died, unmarried, in November 1780 in Lisbon, Kingdom of Portugal, where he had gone for his health. His father died eight months later on 18 July 1781, and his younger brother James succeeded to his father's claim to the Earldom of Perth, but did not use the title.Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval, The Jacobite Peerage, Edinburgh 1904, p. 148 His brother was later created a Peer of Great Britain as Lord Perth, Baron Drummond of Stobhall in the County of Perth.

The satellites are intended to provide broadband connectivity with speeds of 100-plus megabits per second to homes, business and enterprise internet users, commercial, government and business aircraft, as well as government and defense markets, maritime and oceanic enterprises in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. The satellites were first announced in 2015. In February 2016, Viasat announced a partnership with Boeing Satellite Systems. For each of the three ViaSat-3 class satellites, Viasat will build the satellite payload, integrate the payload into the Boeing-provided payload module. Boeing will provide the scalable 702 satellite platform, system integration and test, launch vehicle integration and mission operations services. Each ViaSat-3 satellite payload is being manufactured at Viasat's own manufacturing facility in Tempe, Arizona, using modular structures from Boeing Satellite Systems in El Segundo, California. The satellites are expected to weigh 6,400 Kgs each and are projected to have a total network capacity over 1 terabit per second. ViaSat-3 consists of three separate satellites, each designed to provide coverage to select global regions: ViaSat-3 (Americas) will cover the Americas; ViaSat-3 (EMEA) will cover Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and ViaSat-3 (APAC) will cover the Asia- Pacific regions. The ViaSat-3 (Americas) and ViaSat-3 (EMEA) satellites are expected to launch about six months apart starting in 2021, with the ViaSat-3 (APAC) satellite is projected to launch in the second half of 2022. Viasat has three launch contracts, one for each ViaSat-3 class satellite.
