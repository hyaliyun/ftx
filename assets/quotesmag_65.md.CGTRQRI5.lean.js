She tracks him down in Madrid, Spain, where it turns out Lloyd is drinking and gambling heavily. He is tormented by having ordered so many Air Force pilots to their death on dangerous missions. He also is strangely attracted to Paquita, the wife of his friend and fellow pilot Jimmy Heldon. A mysterious man named Bert Smith, aware that Lloyd is down on his luck, offers him $25,000 to do something illegal and dangerous‚Äîtransport currency from Cairo to Madrid, dropping the box of cash in mid-air.

Jimmy takes the job after Lloyd refuses. He ends up missing and Paquita blames Lloyd, calling him a coward. It turns out to be a test run from which Jimmy returns late but safely.

At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, she won the gold medal in the Individual event, where she defeated the Italian champion Elisa Di Francisca She is a 6-time World champion and 4-time European champion Career Deriglazova began fencing at the age of 8 in hometown Kurchatov. When her potential became apparent she underwent serious training under Ildar Mavlyutov. Despite her diminutive frame as a child, she became accustomed to fencing athletes much older than herself. She won a bronze medal at the 2006 Cadet World Championships in Taebaek, followed a year later by the gold medal in the individual and team events at the Cadet World Championships in Novi Sad. The same year, she took the bronze medal in the Junior World Championships at Prague. She became Junior World Champion in Amsterdam in 2008. Shortly after her world title, Deriglazova got married and gave birth to a daughter, Diana. She stopped training just a week before delivery and went back to the piste two weeks afterwards. Two months after giving birth, she earned the silver medal in the Russian national championship. A year after, in 2010, she took the gold in the individual and team event of the Junior World Championships in Baku. The same year, she joined the senior national team and took a bronze medal in the individual and team events of the senior European Championships in Leipzig. Deriglazova climbed her first World Cup podium in 2011 with a silver medal in Tauberbischofsheim. She was stopped by Korea's Nam Hyun-hee in the table of 16 of the 2011 World Championships in Catania. In the team event, Russia defeated France in the quarter-finals, then Korea to meet the Italian \\"Dream Team\\". Russia lost by a single hit and were doomed to a silver medal. At the 2012 European Championships she defeated reigning Olympic silver medallist Arianna Errigo in the semi-finals and prevailed over teammate Kamilla Gafurzianova to earn her first senior individual title. For her Olympic d√©but at London 2012, she was defeated 8‚Äì15 in the second round of the individual event by France's Ysaora Thibus. In the team event Russia got the best of Japan, then of South Korea. They met No.1 rivals Italy in the final. Deriglazova opened the match against five-time Olympic champion Valentina Vezzali and was defeated 2‚Äì5. Her teammates could not contain Italy either and Russia were eventually defeated 31‚Äì45. Deriglazova was left extremely frustrated by her Olympic experience and resolved to train harder under the new direction of Stefano Cerioni, former coach of the Italian foil teams. During the 2012‚Äì13 season she won her first World Cup title at Budapest, followed by three other victories in Saint-Petersbourg, Tauberbischofsheim and Seoul. Her ambitions for the 2013 European Championships in Zagreb were however cut short in the first round of the individual event by World No.88 Anastasiya Moskovska. In the team event, Russia were defeated by France in the semi-finals, then by Hungary in the match for the bronze medal, and came away with no medal. Deriglazova bounced back by taking the gold medal at the 2013 Summer Universiade after defeating teammate Larisa Korobeynikova in the final. At the World Championships in Budapest Deriglazova made her way to the semi- finals, where she was defeated 15‚Äì11 by Arianna Errigo and took the bronze medal. In the team event, Russia were defeated by France in the semi-finals, but prevailed over South Korea to earn the bronze medal. Deriglazova finished the season World No.2 behind Errigo. In the 2013‚Äì14 season Deriglazova won the Turin World Cup and placed second in Shanghai. At the 2014 European Championships in Strasbourg she was stopped in the second round by teammate Julia Biryukova. In the team event, Russia cruised to the final where they met Italy, which had stayed unvanquished all season. Russia unexpectedly took an early lead. Deriglazova entered the piste for the last relay on 40‚Äì38, which quickly became 44‚Äì38 against Olympic champion Elisa Di Francisca. The Italian then struck seven hits in a row, winning by a single hit in the last seconds of the bout. The World Championships at home in Kazan proved equally disappointing as Deriglazova ceded 15‚Äì8 against Ukraine's Olha Leleiko in the second round of the individual event. In the team event, Russia met Italy again in the final and were defeated again on 39‚Äì45. She then won in the women's individuals in 2015.

History The church is first attested in writing in 1291. In proximity to the church are several runestones, featuring Christian inscriptions and crosses. The church itself is a brick building, the oldest parts of which stem from the 14th century. By the late 15th century, the church had roughly the same appearance as today, but has since been modified and expanded, notably after being ravaged by fires caused by lightning strikes in 1699 and 1889. After the 1889 fire, the Neo-Gothic spire was added. The church is situated near Linnaeus Hammarby and was, in 1758-1778, the parish church of Carl Linnaeus; however, Linnaeus received complaints for his tendency to leave before the service had ended. He would also on occasion send his dog, Pompe, in his place, who would also leave early. Etymology The origin of the name Danmark is unclear, but several theories have been proposed. The explanation most commonly accepted by modern name research is that the name consists of the prefix dan-, derived from Old Norse dank, meaning \\"wet\\" or \\"boggy\\", and the suffix -mark meaning \\"forest\\" or \\"forest's edge\\". Danmark would thus mean \\"the forest by the wetlands\\". Olaus Magnus offers another explanation in A Description of the Northern Peoples (7:15), stating that the church \\"took its name from the homeland of the enemy [Denmark], as the mighty building was funded by loot taken from him, and thus stands as an eternal memorial for those who have fallen.\\" A third theory postulates that the name translates as \\"wood of the Danes\\", suggesting it may have been a settlement for Danes. However, later research asserts that any connection to Denmark is unlikely. The building The church features frescos by Johannes Rosenrod and Albertus Pictor.

History = Summer Lane = William Hutton's 1809 book An history of Birmingham, showing the original building A blue plaque on Centro House Victorian-era cast iron name plate on Hospital Street In 1765, a committee for a proposed hospital, formed by John Ash and supported by Sir Lister Holte, 5th Baronet, the Earl of Bradford, Samuel Garbett, Sir Henry Gough, Charles Adderley, Matthew Boulton, John Baskerville, Sampson Lloyd and others, purchased: from a Mrs Dolphin, for ¬£120 per acre. (Walmore Lane is now Lancaster Street.) However, work to erect the new hospital on that land stopped through lack of funds in 1766. Eventually, much of its funds came from the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, the first of which was held over three days in September 1768, and which continued to fund the hospital into the 20th century. The hospital finally opened on 20 September 1779, giving its name to Hospital Street. About 200 patients were treated in its first three months of operation, even though the 40 beds were fewer than half those aimed for. Two, two-storey side wings were added in 1790. Further extensions were made in 1857 and 1880. Eventually 235 beds were provided on the site. The site was later used for a tram, then bus, depot and is now occupied by Centro House, headquarters of the Transport for West Midlands, where there is a blue plaque (at ) commemorating the hospital. = Steelhouse Lane = Birmingham General Hospital's Steelhouse Lane site, on the Ordnance Survey 25 inch map of 1892-1914 The hospital relocated to Steelhouse Lane in 1897, on a site formerly occupied by almshouses provided by Lench's Trust. The architect of the new, brick building was William Henman. Neville Chamberlain became an Official Visitor and then a director of the Hospital. He advocated a larger facility, a cause in which he was eventually successful, though building did not commence until 1934. He was still fundraising while he was Prime Minister. The hospital became part of the new National Health Service in 1948. Until 1964 the hospital was a training centre for nurses, who, on qualification, became members of the General Hospital Birmingham Nurses League. After 1964, training switched to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the nearby suburb of Edgbaston. The league was wound up in 2000, due to its remaining members' increasing age. The Birmingham pub bombings, the worst terrorist attack on the mainland until 2005, occurred within a mile of the hospital, on 21 November 1974. Taxi cabs and all available ambulances ferried victims to either the General or to the nearby Accident Hospital. After Birmingham General Hospital closed in the mid-1990s, the main red brick building was adapted for use as Birmingham Children's Hospital which opened there in 1998.

It was drained in the late 16th century. The lake was formed 8000 years ago following a rockslide that ponded the village's brook behind it. It had a length of about 2 km when full. The name of the village, \\"Seewen\\" (Old High German for \\"at the lakes\\"), comes from its location near the lake. In the 15th century inhabitants attempted to drain the lake to prevent annoying plagues of mosquitos. In 1588, a 200-metre tunnel was constructed through the rockslide mass which had caused the lake to silt up. The area subsequently became a wetland until being completely drained in 1923. In 2003, two-thirds of the inhabitants voted to rebuild the lake following a feasibility study by the University of Basel. In 2012, a revitalisation project was started by the regional tourism society to develop the area for tourism. The project is supported by the Basel rowing club and the village's mayor, Philippe Weber.

The Italian-American co-production is a fictionalized retelling of the murder of Joseph ‚ÄúCrazy Joe‚Äù Gallo, a mobster who was gunned down on April 7, 1972, at a clam house in Little Italy. The screenplay by Lewis John Carlino is based on a series of articles by journalist Nicholas Gage. The film stars Peter Boyle in the title role, with Paula Prentiss, Fred Williamson, Rip Torn, Luther Adler, Henry Winkler and Eli Wallach.  Plot In New York City, hot-tempered gangster Joe Gallo pulls a knife on a man in a theater who complains about Joe's talking during the movie. Joe later enters a car with his brother Richie and cronies Jelly and Mannie. They don masks, pull guns and perform a mob assassination at a restaurant. Joe and Richie are offended when their boss Falco does not invite them into his home when they arrive for payment of their crime. Falco pays them just $100 each for the job. They crash through the gates of his stately lakeside mansion and take Falco's brother and others prisoner. Don Vittorio, the head of all New York crime families, settles the dispute. Falco agrees to reward Joe and Richie in the future, but he double-crosses them, his thugs nearly strangling Richie to death before burying Jelly in cement. Coletti, who also betrayed Joe and Richie, takes over Falco's operations after the terminally ill Falco dies inside an iron lung. Richie is also ill, suffering from a stomach ailment. His brother is set up, cops catching him red-handed as he tries to extort a merchant. Joe is sent to prison, where he befriends Willy, a black inmate, and helps Willy instigate a prison riot over the prison's unjust conditions. Joe is glad to have a new ally, particularly with the terminally ill Richie committing suicide by driving a car off a cliff. As soon as Joe gets out of jail, he returns to New York and the woman in his life, Anne, then begins building his crime organization with the help of Willy and Harlem associates. \\"Crazy Joe\\" becomes a notorious figure in New York, known for his temper but also for his colorful associations around town. Joe has a confrontation with Coletti and vows to avenge the betrayal that landed him behind bars. But before he can, Don Vittorio beats him to it. Upset with an Italo-American federation Coletti has organized that attracted unwanted attention to the crime families, Don Vittorio arranges for Coletti to be assassinated at a rally and for Joe to be blamed. Anne pleads with Joe to leave town, and an angry Willy needs to be convinced that Joe wasn't the one responsible for Coletti's murder. When he and Willy go to Don Vittorio's home to discuss the situation, Joe threatens the mob boss rather than believe his offer to work together. Vittorio immediately puts out a contract on Joe, and at a restaurant where he, Anne and Willy are having dinner, gunmen turn up and open fire, both men ending up dead.

Gallo was a young Mafioso who gathered the young against the old, just as it happened in China in the name of Mao and in the rest of the world as well.\\" Lizzani went on that \\"What's more - a sacrilegious thing in the Mafia - he made a pact with the Black Panthers, an interracial alliance! I could choose ten other different stories, I could do whatever I wanted and I had the money to do it, but for these reasons I chose to do Crazy Joe. It was a parable that symbolized a season of our contemporary society.\\" Martin Scorsese was initially going to be Lizzani's assistant on the film while Lizzani's original choice for the role of Gallo was going to be Robert De Niro, after seeing him in Bloody Mama. Filming began on 25 June 1973 where the film was entirely shot in New York City. Release Crazy Joe was distributed theatrically in Italy by Cineriz on 8 February 1974. The film grossed a total of 628,266,000 Italian lire domestically. Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti described the film a \\"commercial failure\\" in Italy, noting grossed even less than \\"mediocre genre products such as Kidnap, despite a sturdy cast.\\" The Italian credits of are largely incomplete and contrast with the American film credits. The Italian version credits Dino Mairui, Massimo De Rita and Carlo Lizzani as the screenwriters while the American print credits only Lewis John Carlino as the sole screenwriter. There is also no editor credited in the Italian version. The film opened in New York on 15 February 1974. It was distributed by Columbia Pictures in the United States. The Daily Variety reported that on same date, Barry Slotnick, a lawyer for Mafia member Joseph Colombo intended to file an injunction against Crazy Joe. This involved a claim that the character of Coletti was based on Colombo, which violated his \\"right of privacy.\\" Colombo was comatose during this period after being shot in the head in June 1971. Daily Variety reported on 26 Feb 1974 that a New York Supreme Court judge ruled against the injunction, as the film was not an invasion of Colombo's privacy. Reception From a contemporary review, Vincent Canby found that the film presented the \\"ins and outs of Mafia family wars [as] difficult to follow as pre-World War I Balkan politics, though not quite so fascinating.\\" Canby continued that Peter Boyle played Joe as if he were a \\"dim‚Äêwitted numbers runner\\", and that casting Paula Prentiss as his girl was \\"one of the minor mysteries of the movie year. Could she have wandered onto the wrong set?\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1974 * List of American films of 1974 Notes =References= * External links 1974 films Biographical films about mobsters Films directed by Carlo Lizzani Films set in New York City Films shot in New York City Films set in 1972 Italian crime films Italian films American crime films American films Films about the American Mafia American biographical films Italian biographical films Films produced by Dino De Laurentiis Colombo crime family ","title":"Crazy Joe (film)"},{"id":"36567254","text":"Marc Rigouts and Dunkas competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

The Sheikhdom became a British protectorate between 1899 and 1961 after the Anglo- Kuwaiti agreement of 1899 was signed between Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah and the British government in India due to threats to Kuwait's independence from the Ottoman Empire.  Foundation  Al-Hashemi-II Marine Museum in Kuwait City =Founding= Kuwait was founded in 1613 AD as a fishing village known as Grane (Kureyn). The region soon came under the rule of the Bani Khalid in 1670 after the expulsion of the Ottomans from Eastern Arabia (Lahsa Eyalet) by Barrack bin Ghurayr, Emir of the Bani Khalid, who successfully besieged the Ottoman governor Umar Pasha who surrendered and gave up his rule as the fourth Ottoman governor of al-Hasa.Fattah, p. 83Ibn Agil, p. 78Abu-Hakima, Ahmad Mustafa. \\"Bani Khalid, Rulers of Eastern Arabia.\\" The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750-1965. London: Luzac, 1983. 2-3. Print The families of the Bani Utbah finally arrived in Kuwait in 1713 AD and settled after receiving permission from the Emir of al-Hasa Sa'dun bin Muhammad who ruled from 1691‚Äì1722 AD. The Utubs didn't immediately settle in Kuwait however, they roamed for half a century before finally settling. They first left the region of Najd in central Arabia and settled themselves in what is now Qatar, after a quarrel between them and some of the inhabitants of the region they departed and settled near Umm Qasr living as brigands, raiding passing caravans and levying taxes over the shipping of the Shatt al-Arab.Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia, Geographical, Volume 1, Historical Part 1, John Gordon Lorimer,1905, p1000 Due to these practices, they were driven out of the area by the Ottoman Mutasallim of Basra and later lived in Sabiyya an area bordering the north of Kuwait Bay, until finally requesting permission from the Bani Khalid to settle in Kuwait which was then under the rule of the Emir of al-Hasa who himself was of the Bani Khalid.Abu-Hakima, Ahmad Mustafa. \\"Arrival of the Utub in Kuwait.\\" The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750-1965. London: Luzac, 1983. 3-5. Print. In 1718, the head of each family in the town of Kuwait gathered and chose Sabah I bin Jaber as the Sheikh of Kuwait becoming a governor of sorts underneath the Emir of Al Hasa. During this time as well, the power in governance was split between the Al Sabah, Al Khalifa, and Al Jalahma families in which the Al Sabah will have control over the reins of power whereas the Al Khalifa were in charge of trade and the flow of money, and the Jalahma would be in charge over work in the sea. In 1752, Kuwait became independent after an agreement between the Sheikh of Kuwait and the Emir of Al Hasa in which Al Hasa recognised Sabah I bin Jaber's independent rule over Kuwait and in exchange Kuwait would not ally itself or support the enemies of Al Hasa or interfere in the internal affairs of Al Hasa in any way. =Economic prosperity= In the eighteenth century, Kuwait prospered and rapidly became the principal commercial centre for the transit of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad and Arabia. By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo. During the Persian siege of Basra in 1775‚Äì1779, Iraqi merchants took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed. Between the years 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait. The English Factory was diverted to Kuwait in 1792, which consequently expanded Kuwait's resources beyond fishing and pearling. The English Factory secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. This allowed Kuwaiti vessels to venture all the way to the pearling banks of Sri Lanka and trade goods with India and East Africa. Kuwait was also the center for all caravans carrying goods between Basra, Baghdad and Aleppo during 1775‚Äì1779. Kuwait's strategic location and regional geopolitical turbulence helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait in the second half of the 18th century. Kuwait became wealthy due to Basra's instability in the late 18th century. In the late 18th century, Kuwait partly functioned as a haven for Basra's merchants fleeing Ottoman government persecution. Economic prosperity in the late 18th century attracted many immigrants from Iran and Iraq to Kuwait. By 1800, it was estimated that Kuwait's sea trade reached 16 million Bombay rupees, a substantial amount at that time. Kuwait's pre-oil population was ethnically diverse. The population consisted of Arabs, Persians, Africans, Jews and Armenians. Kuwait was the center of boat building in the Persian Gulf region in the nineteenth century until the early twentieth century. Ship vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of international trade between the trade ports of India, East Africa, and Red Sea. Boats made in Kuwait were capable of sailing up to China. Kuwaiti ship vessels were renowned throughout the Indian Ocean for quality and design. Kuwaitis also developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf. Kuwait was divided into three areas: Sharq, Jibla and Mirqab. Sharq and Jibla were the most populated areas. Sharq was mostly inhabited by Persians (Ajam). Jibla was inhabited by immigrants from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Bahrain. Mirgab was lightly populated by butchers. Kuwait was a central part of the trade in frankincense from Oman, textiles from China, and Indian spices, all destined for lucrative European markets. Kuwait was also significant in the horse trade, horses were regularly shipped by the way of sailing boats from Kuwait. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that Kuwait was exporting an average of 800 horses to India annually. In the early 20th century, Kuwait was dubbed the \\"Marsielles of the Gulf\\" because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people. In a good year, Kuwait's annual revenue actually came up to 100,000 riyals, the governor of Basra considered Kuwait's annual revenue an astounding figure. A Western author's account of Kuwait in 1905: In the first decades of the twentieth century, Kuwait had a well-established elite: wealthy trading families who were linked by marriage and shared economic interests. The elite were long- settled, urban, Sunni families, the majority of which claim descent from the original 30 Bani Utubi families. The wealthiest families were trade merchants who acquired their wealth from long-distance commerce, shipbuilding and pearling. They were a cosmopolitan elite, they traveled extensively to India, Africa and Europe. The elite educated their sons abroad more than other Gulf Arab elite. Western visitors noted that the Kuwaiti elite used European office systems, typewriters and followed European culture with curiosity. The richest families were involved in general trade. The merchant families of Al-Ghanim and Al-Hamad were estimated to be worth millions before the 1940s. =Collapse of economy= A piece of clothing used by Kuwaiti divers searching for pearls, Al-Hashemi-II Marine Museum in Kuwait City In the early 20th century, Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance, mainly due to many trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before Mary Bruins Allison visited Kuwait in 1934, Kuwait lost its prominence in long distance trade. During World War I, the British Empire imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because Kuwait's ruler (Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah) supported the Ottoman Empire, who was in the Central Powers. The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy. The Great Depression negatively impacted Kuwait's economy starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of European decline of demand for goods from India and Africa, the economy of Kuwait suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India. Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich due to gold smuggling to India. Kuwait's pearling industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearling industry led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ship vessels to meet the European elite's need for luxuries pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of cultured pearls also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearling industry. Following the Kuwait‚ÄìNajd War of 1919‚Äì1920, Ibn Saud imposed a tight trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937. The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the Uqair conference in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set. Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir Percy Cox to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi raiding. In 1937, Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time: Some prominent merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship. At the time of the discovery of oil in 1937, most of Kuwait's inhabitants were impoverished.  Mubarak the Great  Mubarak's seizure of the throne via murder left his brother's former allies as a threat to his rule, especially as his opponents gained the backing of the Ottomans. In July, Mubarak invited the British to deploy gunboats along the Kuwaiti coast. Britain saw Mubarak's desire for an alliance as an opportunity to counteract German influence in the region and so agreed. This led to what is known as the First Kuwaiti Crisis, in which the Ottomans demanded that the British stop interfering within what they believed to be was their sphere of influence. In the end, the Ottoman Empire backed down, rather than go to war. In January 1899, Mubarak signed an agreement with the British which pledged that Kuwait would never cede any territory nor receive agents or representatives of any foreign power without the British Government's consent. In essence, this policy gave Britain control of Kuwait's foreign policy. The treaty also gave Britain responsibility for Kuwait's national security. In return, Britain agreed to grant an annual subsidy of 15,000 Indian rupees (¬£1,500) to the ruling family. In 1911, Mubarak raised taxes. Therefore, three wealthy business men Ibrahim Al-Mudhaf, Helal Al- Mutairi, and Shamlan Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi (brother of Hussain Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi), led a protest against Mubarak by making Bahrain their main trade point, which negatively affected the Kuwaiti economy. However, Mubarak went to Bahrain and apologised for raising taxes and the three business men returned to Kuwait. In 1915, Mubarak the Great died and was succeeded by his son Jaber II Al-Sabah, who reigned for just over one year until his death in early 1917. His brother Sheikh Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah succeeded him.  Anglo-Ottoman convention  Map with red circle and green circle boundaries according to the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913 The Kuwait Red Fort in Al Jahra Despite the Kuwaiti government's desire to either be independent or under British protection, in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, the British concurred with the Ottoman Empire in defining Kuwait as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire and that the Shaikhs of Kuwait were independent leaders, as well asqaimmaqams (provincial sub-governors) of the Ottoman government. The independence of Kuwait was also highlighted by the statement made by Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah to the German team who requested an audience with him over the extension of the Berlin-Baghdad railway to Kuwait in which Mubarak said that he would not sell or rent any piece of his land to a foreigner, and that he did not acknowledge the authority of the Ottomans over Kuwait.Kumar, India and the Persian Gulf Region, p.157. The convention ruled that Shaikh Mubarak had independent authority over an area extending out to a radius of 80 km, from the capital. This region was marked by a red circle and included the islands of Auhah, Bubiyan, Failaka, Kubbar, Mashian and Warba. A green circle designated an area extending out an additional 100 km, in radius, within which the qaimmaqam was authorised to collect tribute and taxes from the natives.  History as a Protected State of Britain  =Kuwait‚ÄìNajd War (1919‚Äì1920)= The Kuwait‚ÄìNajd War erupted in the Aftermath of World War I, when the Ottoman Empire was defeated and the British invalidated the Anglo-Ottoman Convention, declaring Kuwait to be an \\"independent sheikhdom under British protectorate\\". The power vacuum, left by the fall of the Ottomans, sharpened the conflict between Kuwait and Najd (Ikhwan). The war resulted in sporadic border clashes throughout 1919‚Äì1920. Several hundreds of Kuwaitis died. The border of the Najd and Kuwait was finally established by the Uqair Protocol of 1922. Kuwait was not permitted any role in the Uqair agreement, the British and Al Saud decided modern-day Kuwait's borders. Kuwait lost more than 2/3rds of its territory due to Uqair. After the Uqair agreement, relations between Kuwait and Najd remained hostile. =Battle of Jahra= The Battle of Jahra was a battle during the Kuwait-Najd Border War. The battle took place in Al Jahra, west of Kuwait City on October 10, 1920 between Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah ruler of Kuwait and Ikhwan followers of Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, king of Saudi Arabia.The blood red place of Jahra, Kuwait Times. A force of 4000 Saudi Ikhwan, led by Faisal Al-Dawish, attacked the Kuwait Red Fort at Al-Jahra, defended by 2000 Kuwaiti men. The Kuwaitis were largely outnumbered by the Ikhwan of Najd. =The Uqair protocol= In response to the various Bedouin raids, the British High Commissioner in Baghdad, Sir Percy Cox, imposed the Uqair Protocol of 1922 which defined the boundaries between Iraq, Kuwait and Nejd. On 1 April 1923, Shaikh Ahmad al-Sabah wrote the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Major John More, \\"I still do not know what the border between Iraq and Kuwait is, I shall be glad if you will kindly give me this information.\\" More, upon learning that al-Sabah claimed the outer green line of the Anglo- Ottoman Convention (4 April), would relay the information to Sir Percy. On 19 April, Sir Percy stated that the British government recognised the outer line of the Convention as the border between Iraq and Kuwait. This decision limited Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf at 58 km of mostly marshy and swampy coastline. As this would make it difficult for Iraq to become a naval power (the territory did not include any deepwater harbours), the Iraqi King Faisal I (whom the British installed as a puppet king in Iraq) did not agree to the plan. However, as his country was under British mandate, he had little say in the matter. Iraq and Kuwait would formally ratify the border in August. The border was re-recognised in 1932. In 1913, Kuwait was recognised as a separate province from Iraq and given autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the draft Anglo-Ottoman Convention, however this was not signed before the outbreak of the first World War. The border was revisited by a memorandum sent by the British high commissioner for Iraq in 1923, which became the basis for Kuwait's northern border. In Iraq's 1932 application to the League of Nations it included information about its borders, including its border with Kuwait, where it accepted the boundary established in 1923. =1920s-1940s= Kuwait was recognised as a separate province from Iraq and given autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the draft Anglo-Ottoman Convention, however this was not signed before the outbreak of the first World War. The border was revisited by a memorandum sent by the British high commissioner for Iraq in 1923, which became the basis for Kuwait's northern border. In Iraq's 1932 application to the League of Nations it included information about its borders, including its border with Kuwait, where it accepted the boundary established in 1923. The 1920s and 1930s saw the collapse of the pearl fishery and with it Kuwait's economy. This is attributed to the invention of the artificial cultivation of pearls. The discovery of oil in Kuwait, in 1938, revolutionised the sheikdom's economy and made it a valuable asset to Britain. In 1941 on the same day as the German invasion of the USSR (22 June) the British took total control over Iraq and Kuwait. (The British and Soviets would invade the neighbouring Iran in September of that year).

In 2013 he became only the second rider to win the Badminton Horse Trials on debut after fellow New Zealander Mark Todd.Kiwi Paget claims Badminton glory Early life Paget was born in Wellsford before moving to Sydney, Australia in 1986. After completing his education he undertook an apprenticeship as a bricklayer and began riding at age 18. He went to rodeo school and applied for a working pupil role with Australian event rider Kevin McNab in Tamborine, Queensland. Under McNab's tutelage Paget progressed from never having jumped a fence, to competing at three-star level eventing in less than two years. After working for McNab for three years, he went to Sydney in 2006 to set up a business producing and competing horses. However, the 2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak near Sydney in August resulted in all horse movements being halted on much of the east coast of Australia. With no ability to ride in Australia, Paget was invited by Frances Stead, a former Auckland businesswoman and strong supporter of New Zealand eventing riders and horses, to return to New Zealand in September 2007 to become the principal rider at her Clifton Eventers base at Muriwai, north-west of Auckland. Competitive career He competed on Clifton Promise, a bay Thoroughbred gelding, born 2 November 1998) in April 2010 in their first CCI****, the Rolex Kentucky Three Day, where he finished in 27th place. In June 2010, Paget and Clifton Promise went to the United Kingdom to prepare for the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG), which was held in Kentucky in October of that year, the pair finished seventh. Whilst Clifton Promise returned to the UK, Paget returned to New Zealand to compete in their Spring season on several other Clifton horses, returning to his Surrey base in the UK in February 2011. Frances Stead sent several more young horses to the UK for Paget to compete in the Spring season there, including Clifton Razz, Clifton Signature, Clifton Cognac and later Clifton Dickara. Since his move to be based in Surrey, England, Paget has worked closely with fellow New Zealanders Mark Todd and Andrew Nicholson, as well as the UK-based New Zealand Eventing Coach, Erik Duvander.

He had trained as a miner in South Africa and was in charge of tunneling operation in Gibraltar during World War II. When he left the army he was also given an OBE. Williams also gave his name to Arow Street which is a tunnel entirely inside the rock. The tunnel's entrance starts at Catalan Bay Road and exits at Sir Herbert Miles Road. It was built in 1942 to bypass a landslide which was triggered by a large detonation of explosives during quarrying operations. The landslide completely blocked off the road to Catalan Bay Village. This tunnel also provides access to MacFarlane's Gallery and during 1944/1945 was used to provide an entrance to a fuel storage area known as Project 'C'.

The Eastern Army All-Star team was led by Lt. Col. Robert R. Neyland, and played September 1942 games against the New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Chicago Bears. The Western All-Stars, coached by Major Wallace Wade of Duke University, played a slate including games beginning late in August 1942 against the Washington Redskins, Chicago Cardinals, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, and Giants. By the end of the exhibition games, it had raised $241,392.29 for the fund. By the time that the war had ended, various service teams had been coached by such legends as Bernie Bierman (Iowa Pre- Flight Seahawks), Paul Brown (Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets), Don Faurot (Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks and Jacksonville Naval Air Station Flyers), Tony Hinkle (Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets), Jack Meagher (Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks), and Joe Verducci (Alameda Coast Guard Sea Lions)‚Äîas well as the aforementioned Neyland and Wade. Even with the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, however, the times still remained uncertain to an extent with the Allied occupation forces facing possible pacification campaigns in the defeated Axis countries, not to mention increasingly strained relations with the Soviet Union. As a result, much of the American war apparatus remained intact, at least initially, during peacetime‚Äîincluding many service football teams. The State Fair of Louisiana, which normally sponsored a series of college football games as part of its annual State Fair Classic, found itself without its regular host schools at times during the war when they were forced to drop their football programs. The locally based Barksdale Field Sky Raiders were invited to play in two of the classic's October games, one against the Selman Army Airfield Cyclones and another against the Lake Charles Army Airfield Flying Tigers; the Camp Swift Dragons ended up filling in for Lake Charles Army Airfield. The fair's \\"Negro Day\\" game featured Wiley College paired against the Randolph Field Black Ramblers (the African American counterpart to the Randolph Field Ramblers). Barksdale Field had also previously competed in the 1934 classic, against Texas Military College. Even the service academies remained strong through 1945, with Army and Navy's annual game featuring the two top teams of the 1945 AP Poll and the game being declared the \\"Game of the Century,\\" with Pres. Harry S. Truman himself attending. Army's Doc Blanchard even won the Heisman Trophy that year. After encountering no significant resistance in the occupied countries over the subsequent year (save for a few, isolated efforts at sabotage by Edelweiss Pirates or Japanese holdouts), most American servicemen were then quickly discharged, and the service football teams essentially left with them. Truman issued Proclamation 2714 formally ending the war on December 31, 1946. One noteworthy post-war game was the Wright Field Kittyhawks 101‚Äì0 win over newly-founded Central State University in 1947.

Brewer Reeves, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, died shortly after the move to Kentucky, leaving the teenage Benjamin, the eldest child, to help raise and support his three younger siblings. On November 12, 1806 in Lincoln County, Kentucky, he married Martha \\"Patsy\\" Donley. When the War of 1812 broke out in June, 1812 Reeves helped organize a company of volunteers for duty and was elected Captain of the group. Attached to American forces in the Indiana Territory, Reeves was promoted to Major. He and his Kentuckians participated in the rescue mission of Zachary Taylor and his garrison at the Siege of Fort Harrison in September, 1812. =Political life= In November, 1812 Benjamin Reeves was called back to Kentucky from the war, having been elected to the state legislature that August. He would serve in the legislature until 1818 when Reeves and his family moved to the Missouri Territory, settling in Howard County. Befitting his previous legislative experience, the people of the county chose Reeves as one of their delegates to Missouri's first Constitutional Convention in 1820-21. In 1824 Reeves was elected Missouri's second Lieutenant Governor, however he would hold the post for just a few brief months before resigning to accept a position with the United States government as a commissioner to survey the Santa Fe Trail. When Missouri Governor Frederick Bates died in office in August, 1825 Benjamin Reeves, as Lieutenant Governor, would have taken over the rest of the term. However the Governorship went instead to Missouri Senate President Pro Tempore Abraham J. Williams until a special election could be held. In one of his first acts as U.S. President John Quincy Adams appointed Benjamin Reeves and two other men -- George C. Sibley and Pierre Menard‚Äîto oversee the surveying of the Santa Fe Trail and establish peaceful relations with Native American tribes along the trail if possible so as to prevent attacks on trade.Duffus R. L., The Santa Fe Trail, First University of New Mexico Press, 1972 With Thomas Mather replacing Menard, the \\"Sibley Expedition\\" left Fort Osage on July 4, 1825. In late August, 1825 near present-day Council Grove, Kansas, the group reached an agreement with the Osage Nation to allow safe passage by wagon trains and traders. Stopping to rest at the Arkansas River while awaiting Mexican permission to cross into their territory, Reeves and Mather decided to return to Missouri and report on progress, which they did in late September. Sibley, surveyor Joseph C. Brown, and other party members continued on to New Mexico. Later years In May, 1835 Benjamin Reeves suffered a personal tragedy when his wife Patsy died. The next year Reeves and his family left Missouri and returned to Kentucky, settling in Todd County. He remarried in August, 1836 to Virginia T. Garth. Reeves resumed a life in politics, serving several terms in the Kentucky legislature until his death. Benjamin Harrison Reeves died April 16, 1849 at his home in Todd County after several months of illness.

He returned to Halle for the second half of the 2011‚Äì12 season, and his 7 goals helped them win the Regionalliga Nord title, and promotion to the 3. Liga.

He worked as a junior inspector of security detention center ‚Ññ 1 FPS in Russia's Krasnodar region. Galstyan was a student in the sports department of the Kabardino-Balkarian State University. In 2007, he finished third at the Russian National Championship and, in the same year, first represented Russia internationally. He has been a member of the Russian national judo team since 2007. In 2009, he became a European Champion, and in 2010 he won a bronze medal in the World Championship. Galstyan competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Men's -60 kg division. Galstyan was an underdog and found himself fighting all of the favorites. In the semifinals, he bested Asian Champion Choi Gwang-Hyeon. Galstyan next overcame reigning two-time World Champion Rishod Sobirov, ranked number one by the International Judo Federation, in the semifinals. Finally, Arsen Galstyan and Hiroaki Hiraoka fought in the finals, and Galstyan defeated Hiraoka with an ippon after 41 seconds. Galstyan scored the ippon as he was about to fall victim to an ippon of Hiraoka's. He achieved his dream of winning an Olympic gold medal and brought Russia its first medal of the Olympic Games. Galstyan is the first ever judoka from the Russian Federation to win an Olympic gold medal. He dedicated his victory to the victims of the flood in the Krasnodar region. R-Sport News Agency named Galstyan Russia‚Äôs second most successful athlete for 2012. He was also ranked in Russia's top ten athletes of 2012 by the Russian Sports Journalists Federation. Personal life In December 2010, Galstyan fought, as a sparring partner, against Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a black belt and former judo champion. His father was his last football coach. Arsen's two brothers, senior Tigran and junior Arman, are both masters of judo and help Arsen train. Galstyan is not married. As of 2012, Galstyan lives in the city of Krasnodar. Galstyan visited Armenia after winning his Olympic gold medal and was called a hero by those in his home country, which was the most enjoyable Olympic moment for him. He still considers Armenia to be his home country, along with Russia. Armenian Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Hrachya Rostomyan congratulated Galstyan on his 2012 Olympic victory. Galstyan also urged all the foreign Armenian athletes to be closer ties with the homeland.

The territorial claims of Flandrensis are a statement to the international community and they claim that the micronation is the only country in the world that doesn't want any people on its territory. On the basis of an interpretation of the Antarctic Treaty (1959), Flandrensis claims five islands off the coasts of West Antarctica: Siple Island, Cherry Island, Maher Island, Pranke Island and Carney Island.USA Today, E. Lyman, New micronation faces birthing pains, 20 May 2015 Niels Vermeersch sent letters to the United Nations, the European Union and to the nations who signed the Antarctic Treaty to inform them of his claim. All of these countries ignored Niels and his claim. Because of the claims, a diplomatic conflict with the micronation Westarctica arose in 2010, this resulted in the creation of the Antarctic Micronational Union (AMU). Coverage of this conflict THE VILLAGE, Federalization of the planet: what with the old world?, 24 October 2014 appeared in the Dutch Columbus magazine, COLUMBUS MAGAZINE, Het Groothertogdom Westarctica , 22 June 2010 the Croatian newssite Telegram TELEGRAM, Dr≈æave za koje niste ƒçuli i koje nitko ne priznaje (a jedna nam je susjed), 2015 and the French book Les Micronations.

National symbols  The flag of Flandrensis is inspired by the first Belgian flag of 1830. The original Belgian flag's yellow band has been replaced by white which symbolises a new beginning. For the same reason there are also two lions on the coat of arms, based on the Flemish lion.  Micronational nobility  In 2015 the Belgian author Julien Oeuillet published the book \\"Le business des vanit√©s: enqu√™te sur les arnaques √† la noblesse\\" about the subject of fake nobility and scams. The book mentions several micronations like Hutt River, Araucan√≠a and Patagonia and Flandrensis. The author described the micronation Flandrensis as an alternative and humoristic way to get a title of nobility, but that nobility in the micronation only exists because of the medieval character of the micronation and not from ambition to create titles. Neither the founder nor the ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù use them outside the community of micronations. Although those titles are considered real and legal, because those are not Belgian noble titles, but the Flandrensisian ones. The micronation does not sell any noble titles.

It is located in Panchagarh District in Rangpur Division in the northern part of Bangladesh and is large enough that it can be seen from space. The archaeological significance of the site lies in its strategic position as an intersection of the trade routes between Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan and the middle and lower Ganges Valley. At its height the city stretched over 5km by 3km and involved rerouting the Talma River.  History  Maharaja Dighi where King Prithu committed suicide according to legend Bhitargarh was a walled city state, the largest in the northern Indian subcontinent, and used to be the seat of King Prithu, popularly known as Maharaja. It used to be an independent city state with a sovereign government till the 13th century. Very little is known about its last sovereign, Prithu Raja, who was believed to have committed suicide because of his religion. There is a legend that Prithu Raja committed suicide along with his army at the Maharaja Dighi to protect their purity from being sullied by an invading force from the impure Kichok Tribe, which had attacked the city. The tribe is believed to be from present-day Cooch Behar District in India, located to the north of the city. In the ancient period, Bhitargarh served as a node of important trade routes, including the Southwest Silk Road, linking the ancient kingdoms of Tibet and Yunnan with Bengal and eastern India. Its location on the bank of Karatoya River made it easier to access Tibet through the city. Its influence in connecting the ancient trade routes in the region extends from Magadha to as far as Southwest China through the Brahmaputra Valley as well as western and southeastern bank of Mekong River. The city could have seen the arrival of Kambojas in the first half of 10th century, who were ruling the rest of Bengal at that time. It became part of the Bengal Sultanate in 1498 during the reign of Alauddin Husain Shah. Bhitargarh later fell into the Khen Kingdom and then into the Koch Kingdom and continued to serve as a trading hub till the seventeenth century when it was conquered by the Mughal Bengal under the reign of Mir Jumla II.  Geography  Bhitargarh covers an area of , situated in the Amarkhana Union of Panchagarh Sadar Upazila within the Panchagarh District. The site is covered by sand and gravel which flowed down from the Himalayan foothills by glacial waters as well as monsoon rainfalls. Topographically, the land is part of the Old Himalayan Piedmont Plains while the gravel beds belong to the Upper Pleistocene stage, similar to the rest of Panchagarh District. The Upper Pleistocene layer is further overlain by Holocene deposits, evident in the alluvium sand, silt and clay. The composition of different minerals in the Holocene gravel beds is indistinguishable from that of the Himalayas. The site is in close proximity to two tributaries of Karatoya river, Talma and Kudum to its west and east respectively. There is also the Teesta River, flowing about to the east of the site, as well as the Salmara river which flows right beside the western rampart of the city.  Archaeological excavations  Excavations at Bhitargarh began in 2008 by a team from the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) when the site was found in a dilapidated condition. Archaeological investigations assert that the city's territorial boundary included four \\"concentric quadrangles\\", separated by ramparts built with earth and bricks. The ramparts were further bolstered by the presence of rectangular bastions and buttresses found at regular intervals. Each of the quadrangles were also surrounded by moats. These ramparts were built to protect the city from both floods and foreign invasions. The fortified structural design of Bhitargarh conforms to the construction recommendations defined at Arthashastra. Excavation at Bhitargarh Some foundations of religious and other monuments that trace their origin to the early medieval period have been discovered in the excavations. One of these structures is a residential complex while the rest are temples. One of the temples has a cruciform shape and has a stupa nearby which is bordered by two verandas, all situated in the first quadrangle. In the second quadrangle exist two gateways called Yama Duar or \\"Door of death\\" at the western rampart and Kala Duar or \\"Door of eternal time\\" at southern rampart. Artifacts which were discovered include pottery, clay, iron, and brass-based objects; copper and gold bangles; terracotta and stone beads as well as some stone sculptures which are believed to be from a period between 7th and 12th centuries AD. Some black basalt-based artifacts including pieces of idols of Manasa, Ramachandra and Hanuman were also discovered by local villagers. Ten ponds (dighi) also exist in the area, of which Maharajar Dighi of 53 acres is historically significant. Archaeological studies also discovered evidence of dams in the ancient city, pointing to the advanced irrigation and cultivation system of its inhabitants. These stone- based dams were built to divert the water of Shalmara into the city during dry seasons to be utilized in agricultural and household activities. One of these dams was located at a place called Domoni at the southern rampart of the third quadrangle, used to control the water flow. There were two additional structures made of granite stones, one at Pathar-ghata and another at Kamarbhita which were built to split the course of Shalmara river into three. These structures were also used as embankments to control the level of water flow to store water at upstream. The Shalmara river then joins the Talma river at Birbandh in the northeastern part of the third quadrangle which is believed to be a man-made diversion made by the city's inhabitants.  Threats and preservation efforts  Despite its considerable potential in the historical studies of the region, Bhitargarh remains threatened by continuous encroachment. The Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh government does not possess any land in the area and neither has any preservation project. As of 2019, about 40,000 people were residing within the archaeological site and were involved with agricultural activities. The people are mostly migrants from Comilla, Rangpur, Tangail, Mymensingh districts as well as recent migrants from Jalpaiguri District of India. Archaeologists believe as the migrants lack close connection with the heritage of the area, they are least interested in its preservation and as such, their continuous habitation and agricultural activities have been causing significant damage to the site. Some community engagement programs have been arranged in the area by archaeologists to build mass-awareness about preserving the heritage of the site and protect it from further damage. A rock museum, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, was established at Panchargarh Government Women's College, displaying different artifacts discovered from Bhitargarh. In 2016, a seminar was arranged at Bangladesh National Museum in Dhaka on the preservation efforts for Bhitargarh archaeological site, attended by then Finance minister of Bangladesh, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith as the chief guest. An allocation of 20 crore BDT was demanded and a permanent custodian office was recommended to establish at the site for its preservation.

The rebels, joined by several nobles, were initially successful in overrunning much of Guria, but they were finally defeated by the Russian army and the allied Georgian nobility in September 1841. Background Guria, a small and poor Georgian rural province on the Black Sea, had been under the Russian hegemony since 1810. In 1829, the Russians eliminated the local autonomous princely rule and imposed a Russian administration. The province had already been a scene of anti-Russian insurrection in 1820Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 85. Indiana University Press, and would gain more notability with a popular Social-Democratic uprising in 1905.Jones, Stephen F. (1989), \\"Marxism and Peasant Revolt in the Russian Empire: The Case of the Gurian Republic\\", Slavonic and East European Review 67: 403‚Äì34. Rebellion In 1841, without regard to local conditions, the Russian government ordered Gurian peasants to cultivate potatoes and to pay their taxes in Russian cash. Guria still maintained a primarily natural economy based on corn and millet. Rumors began to spread among the peasants that money payments would soon be required and that peasants would be drafted into the army. When the tax collections began in May 1841, the peasants of the Lanchkhuti community resisted and took to arms on May 22, 1841. The disturbances spread through all Guria and soon the rebels had almost 7,200 men in their ranks. They took control of most fortified points in the province and blocked roads leading to the city of Kutaisi. On August 9, 1841, the insurgents headed by Abes Bolkvadze clashed with the Russian troops of Colonel Brusilov at Gogoreti, inflicted heavy casualties upon them and forced Brusilov to retreat. Twice that month the Gurians tried but failed to take Ozurgeti, the principal town of Guria and the last remaining outpost of the Russians. Dissension within the rebel ranks led to the defection of many noble allies, most importantly of Prince David Gugunava. Eventually, on September 5, some 2,500 regular Russian troops under Colonel Moisey Argutinsky-Dolgorukov‚Äîaided by the volunteer units provided by the pro-Russian nobles‚Äîattacked the rebels and defeated them, killing more than 60. By late September Guria was again calm and under the Russian control, but the government made no further effort to collect taxes in cash or cultivate potatoes. By 1842, most arrested rebel leaders were released, except Prince Ambako Shalikashvili, who was banished to Siberia. According to a Russian source published in 1901, the Russian losses in the rebellion were at least 32 killed, 115 wounded, and 17 captured. –ì–∏–∑–µ—Ç—Ç–∏ –ê. –õ.

She represented her native state of Uttar Pradesh initially. Due to lack of suitable support from the state's sports association, she began representing Haryana in national-level competitions. Since 2004, Chaudhary has been training with Jiwan Sharma and Divya Sharma at Patiala-based National Institute of Sports. Due to lack of proper facilities, she had to practice with boys. Chaudhury found this to be a good way to train. Sharma says that attributes such as self-belief, hard work and a winning attitude are Chaudhary's strengths.  2012 Summer Olympics  She participated at the 2011 World Judo Championships held in Paris and at the World Cup as a part of her qualification for the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2012 Asian Judo Championships held in Tashkent, she finished seventh in the 63 kg category.

Personal life Besbes was born in a sports family: her father Ali is a former basketball player, who became a physical education teacher; her mother Hayet Ben Ghazi is a former foil fencer, who became an international referee. Her parents settled in Abu Dhabi before she was born. They had all their children‚Äìdaughters Sarra, Azza, H√©la and Rym, and son Ahmed Aziz‚Äìtake up fencing. Azza and H√©la are sabre fencers, while Ahmed Aziz is an epeist. Sarra herself fenced foil until the 2006‚Äì07 season before switching to √©p√©e. Career At the 2011 World Championships in Catania, Besbes noticed she would fight an Israeli athlete during the qualifications phase. She asked the Tunisian Fencing Federation for instructions; the Ministry of Youth and Sports ordered her to drop the bout as part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. Instead of refusing the fight, which would have resulted in sanctions, Besbes remained completely passive during her bout against Israeli Noam Mills, allowing the latter to strike without offering any resistance. This 5‚Äì0 defeat affected her seeding: in her first direct elimination bout she met eventual gold medallist China's Li Na of China and was largely overcome.

It is the home ground of Central Division Two side Wishaw Juniors. The ground was formed after years of Wishaw Juniors playing outwith the town and at the nearby Wishaw Sports Centre. In 2010, Wishaw Juniors secured a 10-year lease to use Beltane Park as the home ground. Since then, the once open-grassed area has been transformed into a football ground, with terracing along the east side of the ground, and fencing around the whole pitch. Also recently installed at the venue are toilets, a snack bar, a players lounge and dressing rooms, with each of them based in portacabins. Known locally as The Beltane, the ground has a capacity of around 500 spectators, and was officially opened on 28 July 2012, when Wishaw Juniors played the under-17's of the local senior side Motherwell. The annual town music festival Be in Belhaven will be moving to Beltane Park for one year only in 2012 from its normal Belhaven Park spot. This is due to Wishaw Town Centre modernization works.

His preference for the technique came from seeing Diego Rivera‚Äôs work and helping with a fresco mural in his hometown of Cuernavaca as a child. When he was 16, he went to Mexico City to study law, but switched to art. He learned the various classic art techniques but kept his preference for watercolor. His career began by teaching art, founding an art institute in the Colonia Roma section of Mexico City. In the 1950s, he tried to get the area's art galleries to show watercolors but they refused, considering it to be a minor art form. He began to host exhibitions of watercolor works at his art institute with success which led to the formation of the Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum in the 1960s. The museum remained in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed the building and led to its relocation to the Coyoac√°n borough, where it remains. During this time, Guati Rojo also had a career showing and selling his own artwork, almost exclusively watercolors, in various parts of the world. Most of his income from this painting went to support the museum. Life Alfredo Guati Rojo C√°rdenas was born on December 1, 1918, in Cuernavaca as the only child of Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s C√°rdenas and Jos√© Guati Rojo Ram√≠rez. He spent his childhood listening to the stories of his paternal grandfather and traveling much of Mexico as his father was a criminal lawyer. He began drawing and painting images from his hometown of Cuernavaca when he was in primary school at about age seven. However he believed that it was seeing the murals of Diego Rivera on the wall of the Palace of Cortes that inspired him to be an artist. He had a primary school art teacher, Luis Betanzos, who recognized the boy's talent. Betanzos was also associated with Eduardo Solares of the Academy of San Carlos. When Solares came to Cuernavaca to paint a new fresco, Guati Rojo was selected to be an assistant. This gave him his first experience in water-based paint. At age 16, he left Cuernavaca for Mexico City to study at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, living at his grandfather's house. He then enrolled into law school as his father wanted to continue the family tradition. However, he soon decided that he did not like law and wanted to transfer to the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas . Despite strong opposition from his father, his mother was supportive and he made the switch. He progressed rapidly and began working at an assistant to his teachers. These earnings allowed him to buy watercolor supplies. Many of these early small paintings are part of the Museum's permanent collection. He graduated in 1940, and although trained in various techniques, he kept his preference for watercolor painting. That same year, he was awarded the ‚Äú√Åguila Azteca‚Äù (Aztec Eagle) for his cultural work in Central and South America along with Ignacio Beteta . He also married Berta Pietrasanta, the sister of one of his art school classmates, Orlando Pietrasanta. The marriage lasted sixty four years, with her working with him on projects, most notably the running and promotion of the National Watercolor Museum after it was founded. They never had children, but the couple considered the museum as such. In 1995, they wrote a ‚ÄúCarta a mi hijo el Museo‚Äù (Letter to my child, the Museum) as testimony. Berta died in May 2003. This along with impending blindness due to disease made Guati Rojo depress and he died only a few weeks later on June 10, 2003. Career Guati Rojo's career began teaching art, starting from 1937 and teaching more or less full-time in various public and private schools until 1969. In 1954 he founded the Instituto de Arte de M√©xico in Colonia Roma. This institute offered shorter courses in the fine arts then traditional institutions and offered classes in ceramics, fashion design and jewelry making as well. The institute was located on the ground floor of the house he and his wife lived in. Here he gave classes and occasionally hosted cultural events. Guati Rojo was one of the first promoters of watercolors in Mexico. In the 1950s, he tried to get watercolors shown at galleries in Colonia Roma but could not because water color was considered only a ‚Äúminor art.‚Äù So his Institute became the first place in Mexico City to exhibit watercolors as a serious art form. The shows at the institute began to have success and favorable reviews, leading watercolor artists in the city to sell their work. In 1955, part of the institute became the site of the first Sal√≥n Nacional de Acuarela (National Exhibition of Watercolors), an annual event which continues to the present. At first Guati Rojo was the judge of the works and bought many of the winning pieces. About a decade later, he founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas in 1964 along with Gustavo Alan√≠s, Edgardo Coghlan, Manual Arrieta, Jes√∫s Ochoa and Teresa Miranda. He remained the organization's president until his death in 2003. From the time he graduated from college, he had gathered a large collection of watercolors, starting with those of her former teachers and his past and present students. This collection became the base of Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum, the first of its kind in the world in 1967. Guati Rojo and the Sociedad tried to get the government to fund a museum site but without luck. Guati Rojo founded another group, the Amigos del Museo de Acuarela (Friends of the Watercolor Museum) with the aim of operating the museum independently at the house in Colonia Roma, spending two years presenting shows and concerts to raise money. During this time, from the 1960s and 1970s, he also worked at the head of Diffusion Cultural of the Desarrollo Integral de la Familia agency and in 1971 he became the head of the Departamento de Artes Pl√°sticos at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. The watercolor museum continued to operate in the building in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed it. However, the loss of the building prompted the government to purchase the museum's current site at Salvador Novo 88 in the Coyoac√°n borough, an expensive section of the city. After this, the government said it would do no more. From 1985 until his death, he and his wife renovated the large house, with the gardens around the main house designed by the two, which includes a ‚Äúpoetic space‚Äù dedicated to the indigenous poet-king Nezahualcoyotl. In addition to its exhibition of its permanent collection and temporary shows, the museum arranges shows of Mexican watercolors all over the world. This has helped Mexican artists and given the institution renown. The museum is the first of its kind in the world, and is partly responsible for the re acceptance of watercolor as a serious art form. Guati Rojo founded the Bienal de la Acuarela (Watercolor Biennal) at the museum in 1992. His work founding the museum was accompanies by a long career of producing artworks, almost exclusively watercolors. His first exhibit was in 1947, and since then his work was shown individually and collectively in many countries of the world including Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, Great Britain, Japan, the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, Canada and Venezuela as well as in many parts of Mexico. His works are found in museum collections in many parts of the world, including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel, the Urawa-Saitama Museum in Japan, Boliviano de Arte Contempor√°neo in Colombia, and Asociaci√≥n Italiana de Acuarelistas de Milan in Italy as well as his National Watercolor Museum in Mexico. Near the end of his life, he was famous enough to sell painting just by announcing its start and not even showing it to the buyer. Much of the income from his own work went to supporting the museum. Shortly before his death, he lost most his sight. His last painting called Desde las sombras (From the shadows) (2003), was done while he was nearly blind. It was painted in as an abstract, printing in black using his hands. Over his career, Guati Rojo received recognition as a member of the Legi√≥n de Honor Nacional, the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, the Royal Society of Arts of England, Agrupaci√≥n de Acuarelistas de Catalu√±a, International Association of Fine Arts of UNESCO, Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour and the American Watercolor Society . Artistry He was considered one of the best watercolor artists and art promoters of Mexico in the 20th century. His main focus in life was to restore watercolor's reputation as a true art form. At the time, watercolor was relegated as a minor art, associated with old women, hobbyists and England of the 19th century. It fell out of favor in the 19th century with the advent of lithographic portraits and landscapes. Large oil paintings came to be seen as the only true art, with the small size of watercolor and their transparency thought of as insignificant. One of his defenses of the art is that fresco is really watercolor, over plaster instead of paper, using the fresco murals of Diego Rivera as examples. He also claimed that the British did not invent it as water based pigments have been used from prehistoric times. Guati Rojo also considered watercolor essential to Aztec civilization as the codices were written with water-based paints on amate paper. Unlike most watercolor artists, who paint on surfaces which are horizontal to keep the paint from running, Guati Rojo painted on vertical surfaces. He defied the effect of gravity by painting thin strokes also giving the images more exactness. He is quoted as saying \\"Water, for me, has always had its mystery. Watercolors do what they want to do. You can¬¥t change them for anything‚Ä¶ No one can really say they have dominated the technique. Every time I start a new painting I am terrified that I will fail.\\" Although he did not do self- portraits, he included his likeness in some of his works. One of these is Salome (1984) where the face of John the Baptist is that to the artist with a beard. In another one of his works El Circo de la Vida (\\"The Circus of Life\\") Guati Rojo paints a circus with three clowns in the foreground, aerialist and a man on a unicycle. The man on the unicycle is said to be Guati Rojo himself. Rojo painted himself into the work in order to show the viewer his participation in the \\"Circus of Life\\". The meaning of this work is to explain the act of creating theater in one's life in order to bring attention to certain subject. In the case of Guati Rojo, it was to bring attention to his museum and the art of watercolor.https://www.facebook.com/MuseoDeLaAcuarela/photos/a.611573538877912.1073741856.160852217283382/611573945544538/?type=3&theater; Guati Rojo tried to spark Mexican interest in the art of watercolor in the 20th century.

Ghazni city is approximately 93 km north of the project area. The German Geological survey conducted a reconnaissance survey in the mid-1960s and the Soviets and the Afghanistan Geological Survey (AGS) conducted exploration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The mine is estimated to contain up to 7500 kilograms of gold. Recently the USGS assessment of the mineral potential in Afghanistan included ongoing compilation of historic German and Soviet mapping, geophysics data, drilling, and sampling data, and incorporation into a GIS database using Esri products. There are many ancient open pits and underground workings that show that this area has been mined in the past. The grades obtained by the Soviet and AGS exploration team show that the skarn mineralization has a core of relatively high gold grades with a halo of lower grades. Four borehole lines were collected by Soviet geologists along the main channel of the Zarkashan River and initial results suggested deposits containing up to 500 mg per cubic meter.

He also developed a method for the numerical quadrature of oscillatory integrals, now known as Filon quadrature. He was Vice Chancellor of the University of London from 1933‚Äì35. Early life He was born at Saint-Cloud, near Paris, as the only child of Augustin Filon, the French litt√©rateur who was appointed as the official tutor to the Prince Imperial. Accompanying the Prince Imperial in his exile, the Filon family came to England in 1878 and lived at Margate. He was educated at Herne House School in Margate. Career In 1894 Filon became a student at University College, London and received his BA in 1896 with a gold medal in Greek. He was appointed in the college as Demonstrator in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Karl Pearson. He spotted a mistake in Pearson's lectures and the correction was incorporated into a joint publication with Pearson. This important paper was Filon's only publication in statistics. In 1898 Filon went to King's College, Cambridge on an 1851 Exhibition Research Fellowship for advanced study. In July 1902 he earned a doctorate in mixed mathematics from University College, London, and in 1903 he became there a lecturer in pure mathematics under M J M Hill. In 1910 Filon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1912, upon Pearson's retirement, Filon was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College, London.

Hugo of Oignies (, before 1187 in Walcourt - c. 1240 in Oignies) was a lay brother of Oignies Abbey. He was a metalworker and painter and is the last of the great jewelers of Mosan art. He is a representative of the school of the Entre-Sambre-et- Meuse and was considered the greatest artist of the Meuse Valley of his time. Life In 1187 Hugo helped to found what became the Priory of St. Nicholas, along with his three brothers, all of whom were priests, when they moved from their native city in the County of Namur to live a monastic style of life by a small country chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra near Oignies in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. Little is known of Hugo himself before 1228, when his works at the priory were first noted. Without doubt, he trained as a goldsmith. Hugo was literate, a master scribe, and a miniaturist. He signed many of his works. In circa 1230, Hugo produced a manuscript and silver book covers for the monastery. The book cover contains depictions of Hugo and St. Nicolas, the monastery's patron saint. During a visit to the priory in 1228 or 1229 to consecrate an altar, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Saint-Jean d'Acre and later cardinal, became a patron of his work. Around that time, Hugo created what are considered among his masterpieces, an Evangeliary and a reliquary. He crafted a series of pieces in silver: reliquaries, monstrances, and other objects of worship, of which three signed pieces still exist. In his work, the human figure merges with the technical virtuosity with which the artist treats the decor's watermarks, crimping delicate cabochons. He provided works of art for the monastery. These included liturgical objects such as crosses, chalices and other religious artifacts which are considered to be masterpieces of metalwork. Legacy When the priory was overrun and the community of canons regular scattered by forces of the French Revolutionary Army in 1796, its treasures were hidden by the last Prior of Oignies at a farm in Falisolle. After the death of the farmer, the treasure became entrusted in 1818 to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, who were being founded in that period. In 1939, when the Nazi invasion of Belgium at the start of World War II threatened the convent and its treasure, it was moved and escaped the destruction of the convent. After the reconstruction of the convent buildings, the treasure was returned to the Sisters, who placed it in a specially- equipped room in their convent, one of the smallest museums in the world. In early 2010 they were moved again, this time to the Museum of Ancient Arts in Brussels. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says of his contribution to Gothic metalwork, \\"The growing naturalism of the 13th century is notable in the work of Nicholas' follower Hugo d‚ÄôOignies, whose reliquary for the rib of St. Peter in Namur (1228) foreshadows the partly crystal reliquaries in which the freestanding relic is exposed to the view of the faithful; it is decorated with Hugo‚Äôs particularly fine filigree and enriched by naturalistic cutout leaves and little cast animals.\\" References Bibliography * Doumont, Dani√®le.

Waterford The Blackwater Valley Opera Festival (formerly the Lismore Opera Festival and Lismore Music Festival) is a classical music and opera festival held annually in Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland. Founded in 2010 by Jennifer O'Connell and artistic director Dieter Kaegi, the festival was re- launched as the Blackwater Valley Opera Festival in February 2018. Previous events have consisted of three opera nights performed in Lismore Castle's stable yard. Concerts and recitals have also been staged in Lismore and in historic homes located along the banks of the Blackwater River downstream to the parish of Cappoquin. These venues have included Salterbridge House, Cappoquin House, Tourin House, Dromore Yard and Lismore Cathedral. In 2012, Irish President Michael D. Higgins inaugurated the festival's annual school's access programme. Marco Zambelli was the conductor of the festival for several years, except in 2016, when Killian Farrell conducted Cos√¨ fan tutte, and in 2019 when Darren Hargan conducted Don Pasquale. The 2019 festival presented two operas for the first time, with 15 performances in total, including a solo recital by Giovanni Bellucci. The 2020 event was cancelled as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, however, the festival organisers coordinated with a classical music education company to run outdoor concerts in several residential care homes and hospitals.

The unit was deactivated in 1968 at Knoxville. On 17 January 2006, the command was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 316th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) and was activated on 16 September 2007 at Coraopolis, Pa. The 316th Sustainment Command is the U.S. Army's first transformation-era modular ESC unit, and the first to deploy to Iraq. The 316th transformed from a traditionally structured force to one designed to better address sustained military operations and missions and the nation's emergency rapid response. The 316th is a model for future military operations around the world with a deployment mission to provide command and control of all sustainment forces in an operational theater. While in Iraq (August 2007-June 2008), the 316th ESC, composed of more than 20,000 sustainment Soldiers, synchronized and provided logistical support to U.S. units (165,000), Multi-National Coalition partners and Iraqi Forces in support of all operations. That support translated into everything from bullets to beans, fuel to maintenance parts and coordinating certain human resource services (liaison teams, personnel replacements, finance). = Subordinate units = As of 2017 the following units are subordinated to the 316th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary):http://www.usar.army.mil/Commands/Operational/377th- TSC/316-ESC/316units/ * 316th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania ** 77th Sustainment Brigade, in Fort Totten, New York ** 301st Regional Support Group, in Butler, Pennsylvania ** 475th Quartermaster Group, in Farrell, Pennsylvania ** 655th Regional Support Group, in Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts  Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (SSI)  The 316th's unit patch is a white disc within a 1/8-inch red border, 2 inches in diameter.

He enrolled in the order in 1912, and was ordained 25 August 1918.[N√∫√±ez 2009] p. 6. He was already a well-known religious and historical writer during the era of the Second Spanish Republic.[N√∫√±ez 2009] passim, esp. p. 9. In mid-1938, during the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists established the headquarters of their Women's Section in the Salesian convent of Burgos. At that time, Pilar Primo de Rivera sought someone capable of leading the spiritual organization of the religious life of that organization. Severino Aznar, father of Agust√≠n Aznar, commented that at the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos there was a spiritual and erudite monk who would doubtless be good for the job. Pilar took this counsel, proposing P√©rez Santiago's candidature to abbot Luciano Serrano.[N√∫√±ez 2009] p. 10-11.

He became a Procurador en Cortes when the first legislature of the Francoist Cortes Generales was convened 16 March 1943. P√©rez Santiago's first notable writing was poetry he wrote while still a student at Silos. Also at Silos, he became acquainted with several languages, acquiring fluent French, decent English and German, and a good familiarity with Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Arabic.[N√∫√±ez 2009] p. 5. In 1925 he published the first[N√∫√±ez 2009] p. 7. of what would eventually be 71 books in the fields of hagiography, history, liturgy and art. From the outset, he wrote for a wide variety of audiences, ranging from academic works to works for children. He received his doctorate from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1950. That same year, by means of a competitive exam, he became Professor of Medieval Spanish History at that same university. He was also Honorary Counselor of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and Director of the Colegio Mayor \\"Marqu√©s de la Ensenada\\".

However, he wanders away for a few minutes to film scenery with his video camera, and eventually falls asleep. When he wakes up, he quickly returns to where he last saw Molly, only to find that his parents have also fallen asleep and his sister is nowhere to be found. When her coloring book is found at the end of a nearby dock, it is believed that the little girl has fallen into the river drowned. Days of searching turn up nothing, and many assume that Molly's body was pulled too far downstream and is lost. Six months later, Chris makes a discovery on his video camera that may prove that Molly didn't drown in the river that day. He instead believes that she was kidnapped and may still be alive. With the help of his best friend, Pat, the two set off on a journey from Wisconsin to Florida to discover the truth. Film The novel was made into a film in 2002 starring Jonathan Rudy, Ben Watson, and Chanise McClure and directed by Mark Goodman. Instead of travelling to Florida to find Molly, the boys travel to New Mexico. The film received mixed reviews.

He was also the star player for the Temple University Owls in the inaugural Sugar Bowl game on January 1, 1935, in New Orleans, Louisiana. High school The youngest of seven children, Smukler was born in Gloversville, New York, to Russian immigrants. His family moved to Newark, New Jersey, in 1918, where he played tackle at East Side High School in 1929 and 1930, earning all-State honors the second year. Still in his teens, he returned to Gloversville to live with his oldest brother Lewis and became his apprentice, learning to shear gloves from skins. Playing football at Gloversville High School, Smukler was taken out of the line by Coach Lawrence A. (Duke) Miller and made into a fullback. He had never kicked a football for any team before, but he spent hours by himself punting the ball. Smukler kept his muscles strong by walking five miles uphill after every practice. When the football season began, he was considered a ‚Äúone-man team‚Äù and lost only one game. Besides excelling in football, Smukler was also a high-scoring guard on the basketball team and a member of the track team. In May 1932 he participated in the annual Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute interscholastic track meet in Troy, New York, and broke two state records, the 12-pound shot put and the discus throw. College Smukler enrolled in the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and played fullback under Frank Carideo. He left before the year ended and continued to learn glove cutting under his brother Lewis. In September 1933 Smukler transferred to Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was chosen to play varsity fullback by Glenn ‚ÄúPop‚Äù Warner one year later. After Smukler helped the Temple Owls achieve many wins, Warner stated, ‚ÄúHe is a better fullback now than Ernie Nevers was in Nevers‚Äôs sophomore year. Dave is the best sophomore fullback I have ever seen. He may become the greatest fullback I have ever seen, a greater football player than Nevers or Jim Thorpe.‚Äù The coach also commended him as a defensive player, kicker, and forward passer, stating that ‚Äúhe combines fine judgment with his versatility. He is not the type that will get puffed up by praise, either.‚Äù Smukler played five consecutive games without ever letting the ball slip from his hand. On January 1, 1935, he played against Tulane University in the inaugural Sugar Bowl game in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the teams were awaiting kickoff, Tulane‚Äôs slogan was ‚ÄúStop Smukler.‚Äù Smukler passed for one touchdown, kicked the extra point, and ran for a 25-yard touchdown. His efforts brought the Owls a 14-0 lead, but Tulane would ultimately beat Temple with a score of 20-14. Smukler was described after the game as ‚Äúa wild bull, a mad elephant, a rip-roaring locomotive, a human-battering ram. He was 212 pounds of speed and power, who asked nothing more of his own line but that it get out of his way and let him run.‚Äù Smukler temporarily withdrew from Temple in December 1935 due to a knee injury but returned at the start of the second semester. However, in March 1936 Smukler announced that he was leaving Temple again for a business position that was \\"too promising to refuse.\\" He never graduated. Professional Football It was announced in August 1936 that Smukler had a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. Apparently, the contract was signed two months before, but it was not announced earlier due to the uncertainty of Smukler's injury. He played with the Eagles for four seasons from 1936-1939. During his first year he had a career-high of 99 rushes for 321 yards. Steve Owen, coach of the New York Giants, identified the Eagles as one of the teams he most feared ‚Äúbecause they are dangerous any time Dave Smukler, the erstwhile Temple Terror, carries the ball.‚Äù Apparently, team owner Bert Bell once said that nobody could stop Smukler ‚Äúwhen he was having a good day.‚Äù On Oct. 2, 1938, the Eagles played the Chicago Bears at Philadelphia Municipal Stadium. The National Football League (NFL) program described Smukler as a ‚ÄúPowerhouse ball carrier and backer up on defense. Brilliant forward passer and terrific punter. Fifth best passer in the National Football League last year, completing 42 of 118 throws for a total gain of 432 yards. Carried ball from scrimmage 92 times to gain a total of 247 yards.‚Äù After playing 34 games with the Eagles, Smukler was suspended in October 1939 for breaking training rules. When owner Bert Bell asked him why, Smukler allegedly told him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm through with football.‚Äù Apparently, Smukler had broken training rules various times in the past. He had made a pledge to Bell that this would not happen again, only to break training once more. Bell said, ‚ÄúIn my opinion, Dave was one of the greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be. But I believe for the best interests of the team and myself we can do better without him as he was a demoralizing influence. He is a good boy but he just can‚Äôt keep his promises.‚Äù In April 1940 he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, ‚ÄúI got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn‚Äôt get a job.‚Äù Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. ‚ÄúIt was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn‚Äôt play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.‚Äù Smukler was in active service for over three years. After serving as a first sergeant in Iceland, he received a medical discharge due to his old knee injury. He went back to work as a glove cutter in Gloversville and helped coach the football team at Gloversville High School. Smukler considered returning to football with the Detroit Lions, but he never appeared on their gridiron and was sold to the Boston Yanks in 1944. Smukler played only two games for the Yanks before ending his professional football career. Later Years In 1946 Smukler moved to California and was employed for three years as a station manager with the Standard Oil Company. He later worked in tire sales and held managerial posts with different companies. In 1947 it was reported that he joined the football coaching staff at Loyola University in Los Angeles as an end coach. Smukler later became West Coast commissioner for the Pop Warner Conference. He founded the Pop Warner Conference in Los Angeles and received the group‚Äôs first Joe Tomlin All- American Award for ‚Äúservice beyond the call of duty.‚Äù At time of his death Smukler was general sales manager for Bridgestone Tire Co. of America, Inc. He was stricken with a heart attack at Los Angeles International Airport while preparing to board a plane for a sales meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Smukler was 56 years old. He had suffered from heart trouble and underwent surgery seven years earlier for the installation of a pacemaker. Notes There is disagreement among sources as to whether David Smukler was born in Gloversville, New York, or Newark, New Jersey. The article ‚ÄúSmukler‚Äôs Parents Wed 55 Years Ago‚Äù (The Morning Herald, March 16, 1949) states that his parents moved from Gloversville to Newark in 1918, four years after his birth. This would suggest that he was born in Gloversville, NY. The California Death Index also states that he was born in the state of New York. Most sources, including the California Death Index, state that he died on February 22, 1971. However, his obituary \\"Grid Great Dave Smukler Dead at 56\\" (Amsterdam Recorder, February 24, 1971) suggests that he died on February 23, 1971. His obituary \\"All-American Dave Smukler, Ex-Glover Star, Dies At 57\\" (Schenectady Gazette, February 1971) states in the title that he died at age 57, but the obituary itself states that he died at age 56. All other records suggest or state that he died at age 56.

The original part of the cemetery is listed at Grade II in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History The cemetery was laid out between 1848 and 1850 by T. M. Penson. This original part of the cemetery to the north of Overleigh Road is described by the authors of the Buildings of England series as having been \\"highly romantic\\", and as still being \\"eminently picturesque\\". Overleigh Cemetery was a private development by the Chester General Cemetery Company; it was consecrated on 12 November 1850 by the Bishop of Chester; in 1875 it contained a lake with three islands, two chapels, two lodges, paths and trees, and a house for the chaplain. It was extended to the south in 1879 (this part is not included in the listing). The south part of the cemetery is described as being \\"prosaic\\". In 1930 the cemetery came into the ownership of Chester City Council, and it was further extended to the south during the 20th century. Penson's lake, lodges and chapels are no longer present. The West Chapel in the south part of the cemetery was built in 1904 and is Grade II listed. It fell into disuse and is now the Greek Orthodox Church of St Barbara the Great Martyr. Notable structures The gates and gate piers designed by Penson at the original entrance to the cemetery are still present, and are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. Also listed at Grade II is a bridge over the drive in the north section of the cemetery, which was designed by Penson. In the north part of the cemetery, and listed at Grade II, are the following monuments: to John Graham, Bishop of Chester who died in 1865, to William Makepeace Thackeray (1769-1849), uncle of the novelist of same name, to U Larsing, a missionary to Bengal, who died in 1863, to Revd Richard Knill, who died in 1857, and his wife, who died in 1870, to Samuel Venables, master of Chester Bluecoat School, who died in 1848, to William Brown of Browns of Chester, who died in 1852, and to Henry Raikes, Chancellor of the diocese of Chester (designed by Penson, with an effigy by Thomas Earp). In the south part of the cemetery is a monument to Frederick Coplestone who died in 1932. It dates from 1934, was designed and carved by Eric Gill, and is listed at Grade II*. Also in the south part of the cemetery, and listed at Grade II, are the west chapel, and a cenotaph, in form of a Cross of Sacrifice, to those who died in the First World War. The chapel is currently used by the Greek Orthodox Community of St. Barbara. Another notable gravestone in the cemetery, although not listed, exists to Edward Langtry, (estranged first husband of actress Lily Langtry), who died in a local lunatic asylum in 1897.

Another notable gravestone in the cemetery, with an epitaph \\"Far From The Bones Of His Ancestors\\" in both English and Japanese, is that of the Japanese actor Ishiao Ishimura, one of the acting team \\"The Mikado Family\\", who died on stage in December 1915 in the Royalty Theatre in Chester when he fell and broke his neck. Graves The Overleigh Cemetery database lists details of over 60,000 burials. Photographs of some of the more notable memorials are given on the Chester Walls website. The cemetery contains the graves of 197 Commonwealth service personnel, 127 from World War I (about half of them burials from local hospitals,) and 69 from World War II.

It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians. It stands in a rural situation, 6 km west of the city centre on Stannington Road, overlooking the Loxley Valley. The building is Grade II listed. Underbank Schoolroom, which is closely associated with the chapel, stands 50 metres to the south-west. It is also a Grade II listed building. History The congregation dates its founding to 1652, when it first began to meet in a converted barn on an adjoining site. This was established when Richard Spoone left land and a building in his will to establish a ‚Äúpreaching minister‚Äù. As the chapel was founded during the Commonwealth of England, the minister was of the Presbyterian denomination. The setting up of this chapel of ease allowed the people of the Stannington district to worship locally for the first time, as prior to this the nearest church was the Church of St Nicholas at High Bradfield, some five km away. By about 1700 they counted themselves Dissenters. By the year 1740 the original chapel had become unfit for use and Thomas Marriott of Ughill, a local Calvanistic dissenter, built the present day chapel on a nearby plot of land he had purchased for the purpose. The chapel was opened on 2 June 1743 by Mr. Wadsworth, Mr. Samuel Smith and three or four ministers, one of whom had come from Doncaster. In 1785 the chapel embraced Unitarian beliefs when Reverend Edmund Gibson became minister. Many of the congregation could not accept Unitarianism and left the church, either returning to St. Nicholas or attending the newly opened Congregational church on Queen Street in the centre of Sheffield. In 1796 Underbank was visited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who at that time was considering becoming a Unitarian minister; he met the chapel‚Äôs minister, the Reverend Astley Meanley.

The other depictsJesus welcoming the children. The interior of the chapel has undergone several major changes over the years. It now seats approximately 110 people downstairs, plus 50 to 70 in the gallery. It added fixed pews in 1860. It used to have two long side balconies, necessary to accommodate the large numbers attending the services. These were removed, and now only the balcony on the east wall at the back of the chapel remains. In 1952 there was a major refurbishment, which saw the addition of a vestry by removing two rows of pews and adding panelling. At the same time the pulpit was moved into a more central location, exchanging positions with the organ, which is now situated in the north-western corner. The organ itself is a Brindley & Foster pipe organ which was purchased second-hand in memorial of chapel members lost in World War I. By the pulpit on the west wall is a wall hanging made by congregation members which commemorates the 350th anniversary of the founding of the original chapel in 2002. Underbank Schoolroom The Schoolroom Underbank Schoolroom stands 50 metres to the south-west of the chapel, at the junction of Stannington Road, Riggs Low Road and Stopes Road. =History= The original school building was established in similar circumstances to the chapel when Richard Spoone, a local landowner, left a property called Sim House in his will dated 23 May 1652, to provide ‚Äúfor the education of poor children whose parents are willing but unable to keep them in school‚Äù. Ralph Wood, the minister of the chapel, was the first schoolmaster, paid seventeen shillings and sixpence a quarter. In February 1844 George Revitt, aged 21, was appointed master by the trustees, being paid an annual salary of ¬£20. He remained master for 31 years, and under him the school prospered. The trustees started to look for a site for a larger school; however in the end it was decided to demolish the old school and build the new one on the same site. Construction of the new school was completed in 1853 and it opened on 8 May 1854. It cost between ¬£500 and ¬£600 to construct: the trustees contributed ¬£100, as did the Sunday school, and there was a contribution from the Bingley House trust, but this left a considerable balance still to be repaid. It took 31 years to clear the debt, with a public subscriptions list being started which raised ¬£270. The balance was finally paid in April 1885 by the proceeds of a bazaar at Channing Hall, linked to Upper Chapel in Sheffield. In September 1910, the school was taken over by the County Council and it was announced that the school would close on 31 July 1911. The pupils were moved to the new and more centrally located Stannington Council School (Infants Department) with Underbank‚Äôs headmistress Mrs. Payne becoming head of the new school. =Architecture= The building is constructed from rock faced gritstone with a Welsh slate roof. It consists of a single storey with a basement; the windows are tall, round headed with multiple small panes. A central plaque on the upper outer east wall reads: ‚ÄúDay and Sunday School erected A.D. 1853.‚Äù Gives architectural details of schoolroom.

He was the second son of George Ross, 11th Lord Ross. When Wynne's Regiment of Dragoons was raised in 1689, Ross joined as a captain, and served with the regiment in the Williamite War in Ireland. He went to Flanders with the regiment as lieutenant-colonel in 1694, and was appointed colonel of the regiment on Wynne's death, 15 July 1695. In 1704 he secured the title of the Royal Dragoons of Ireland for his regiment. Balnagown Castle Ross was promoted brigadier-general on 9 March 1702, and major-general on 1 January. He commanded a brigade of Dragoons at the battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet. He was further promoted to lieutenant- general on 1 January 1707, made Colonel-General of all the Dragoon Forces on 1 May 1711, and promoted to full general on 1 January 1712. He was removed from the colonelcy of the Royal Dragoons of Ireland on 8 October 1715, but reappointed on 1 February 1729, holding the post until his death. In 1711 he inherited the estate of Balnagown from David Ross, the 13th Laird of Balnagown, who had rebuilt the castle but died with no heirs. General Ross was Member of Parliament for Ross-shire from 1710 to 1722 and from 1727 to 1732. In September 1713 he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary to France, but did not take up the post. He died at Bath and was buried at Fearn Abbey, leaving his estate of Balnagown to his great-nephew Charles Ross. References * D. W. Hayton, ROSSE (ROSS), Hon.

After the Persian king Cyrus the Great captured Babylon in 539 BCE, he allowed and helped finance the return of Jews to Judea with the Edict of Cyrus in 538. The Murashu tablets are dated to this period after Jews were allowed to return to Judea. The fact that the banking house \\"Murashu & Sons\\" conducted business with Jews who decided to remain in Nippur rather than return to Judea suggests that life in Persian-controlled Nippur was at least somewhat tolerable for Jews. The tablets discuss one such Jew, Udarna, son of Rahim-ili. Some of Udarna's property was stolen by his brother and nephew. To see that he might reacquire his property, Udarna brought his complaint to Bel- nadin-shumu, one of the sons of \\"Murashu & Sons.\\" Udarna did have his property returned. In addition, no charges were brought against his brother or nephew. They also agreed that no offspring of Udarna would ever bring charges against Udarna's brother or nephew or their offspring. This act of forbidding any suit being brought against Udarna's brother and nephew or the generations after, was seemingly implemented to prevent a blood feud that might last generations. Banking HV Hilprecht considers the group (\\"firm\\") to be bankers and brokers, who were engaged in money-lending and trading operations in southern and central Babylonia for a period of 50 years from the end of the 5th century (Dandamaev, Lukonin,Kohl). Three generations of the family are attested to in the Nippur documents. The archives (\\"legal\\" documentation) include matters concerning the less wealthy of Nippur living in the outer areas of the city, although also the interests of both royalty (the renting of fields - Dandamaev, Lukonin, Kohl) and those associated with these, participating as officials within their estate. The artifacts are dated to the time of the reign of the kings Artaxerxes I and Darius II, (otherwise dated 465, 464 or 455 to 404 or 403 BCE).MA Sweeney, DW Cotter, JT Walsh, C Franke - The Twelve Prophets: Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Volume 2 - Liturgical Press, 2000 Retrieved 2012-07-282nd - WM SchniedewindJP Nielsen - Sons and Descendants: A Social History of Kin Groups and Family Names in the Early Neo-Babylonian Period - ProQuest, 2008 Retrieved 2012-07-29Lewis & Boardman page 251\\"equerry\\" -cambridge dictionary.orgO Lipschitz, M Oeming - Judah and the Judeans in the Persian Period - Eisenbrauns, 2006 Retrieved 2012-07-28M Van De Mieroop - Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History Routledge, 8 Jul 1999 Retrieved 2012-07-28SE Alcock p.94B Schramm - The Opponents of Third Isaiah: Reconstructing the Cultic History of the Restoration Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995 Retrieved 2012-07-28 The core activity of the family was fief and estate land management, with members primarily active as creditors for workers of agricultural enterprises, in the lending and provision of equipment, seed, tools, irrigation and animals for this purpose, to individuals including Jews, these relevant as to the book of Ezekiel.

One of the world's leading experts in M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy, he is also known as one of the driving forces behind the development of synchrotron science in Canada, becoming the first director of the Canadian Light Source synchrotron after a 30-year \\"Odyssey\\". Early life and education Bancroft was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the son of an accountant, but grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he attended Kelvin High School.Kelvin High 100th anniversary He graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1963, subsequently earning an MSc in chemistry (1964) from the same institution. Later that year he went to the University of Cambridge, England to study for a PhD at Corpus Christi College. He worked under the supervision of A.G. Maddock on the development of M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy, obtaining his PhD in 1967. Over a 20-year period Bancroft would become one of the world's leading experts in M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy, publishing more than 80 papers, a major review and an authoritative textbook in the field. University of Western Ontario After working as a postdoc at the University of Manitoba, Bancroft returned to Cambridge as a Fellow at Christ's College. Bancroft returned to Canada in 1970, as an assistant professor in the department of chemistry at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), becoming a professor in 1974, spending two periods as head of department. Bancroft was director of the Centre for Chemical Physics from 1977 to 1981, establishing Surface Science Western during his tenure. At UWO Bancroft became interested in photoemission spectroscopy, and in 1972, with National Research Council (NRC) support, a spectrometer was purchased for research using far ultraviolet and X-ray photons. This purchase also involved the universities of Toronto and Windsor in a Southwestern Ontario consortium. Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility In 1972 Bancroft took part in a workshop organised by Bill McGowan of (UWO) on the uses of synchrotron radiation, an event he has described \\"the beginning of my 30 year odyssey to develop Canadian synchrotron capabilities in the US and then in Canada\\". He began work at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US, in 1975, as a result of contact established with then-SRC director Ed Rowe at the 1972 meeting. After several failed attempts were made to establish a synchrotron facility in Canada, Bancroft submitted a proposal to the NRC to build a Canadian beamline at SRC. In 1978 the newly created NSERC awarded capital funding, and the Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility (CSRF) was founded. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, with Bancroft as scientific director, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998. Canadian Light Source The push for a synchrotron lightsource in Canada gained impetus in the early 1990s with the formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR) with Bancroft as president. In 1994 NSERC recommended building a Canadian synchrotron, and set up a committee to decide between two rival bids to host the facility, led by Dennis Skopik of the University of Saskatchewan and Bancroft of UWO. In 1996 the committee recommend that the Canadian Light Source (CLS) be built in Saskatoon. With the formation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation a funding mechanism for the lightsource became available, and after what Bancroft has described as a \\"Herculean\\" effort by the Saskatchewan team the funding was finalised in 1999. At this point Skopik departed to the US, and Bancroft was appointed as the first director of the CLS. Bancroft's appointment ended in 2001,CLS Newsletter October 2001 although he remained as research director until 2004, and he returned to UWO. Bancroft's association with the CLS continues, and he currently serves on their board of directors. Awards and honours Bancroft was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (RSC) in 1979 (at the age of 37), and was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2003. He was awarded the RSC's Rutherford Memorial Medal in 1980, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982/3, and the CIC and Montreal medals of the Chemical Institute of Canada in 1996 and 2002 respectively. The Canadian Light Source annual award for best PhD thesis is named for Bancroft.

He was a frequent reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement, an author of books on both literary criticism and architectural history, and Chair of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain, whose journal, Architectural History, he edited for many years. Life and career Andor was the son of Arnold Wycombe Gomme, a British classical scholar and Professor of Ancient History at the University of Glasgow and Phyllis Kate Harvey. The first name Andor was originally a nickname, and began as a family joke for the unborn baby (or babies) of unknown sex. He studied at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was taught by F.R. Leavis and attained a First Class Honours degree in Moral Sciences. He was appointed to a three-year fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1956. In 1960, he married fellow scholar Susan Koechlin, with whom he had one son and three daughters. The couple settled in Church Lawton, Cheshire, after Andor obtained a permanent position at Keele University in 1963; he had previously worked in the Extra-Mural Department at the University of Glasgow, and at the University of Montana. At Keele, he was promoted from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer and Reader, achieving the title of Professor of English Literature and Architectural History in 1984 \\\\- a chair created to reflect his unique range of interests. In 1995 he was appointed to the position of Emeritus. He was a regular front-page and anonymous reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement, and wrote several books on literary criticism and architectural history. His first book, Attitudes to criticism, has been described as \\"a critical celebration of the very similar sensibilities and minds of Leavis and the American Yvor Winters\\", while his last book, Design and plan in the country house (with co-author Alison Maguire), has been praised by Professor Tim Mowl as a \\"remarkable scholarly resource\\" despite its \\"ambitious range\\". For many years, Gomme was editor of Architectural History, the flagship journal of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain of which he was Chair from 1988 to 1991. He died in Church Lawton on 19 September 2008. The author of his obituary, Emeritus Professor of Cultural Studies Fred Inglis, described Gomme as \\"one of the best British architectural historians since John Ruskin\\". Gomme had a long-standing interest in choral music, and he edited a 1997 reconstruction of J.S. Bach's St Mark Passion which was published by B√§renreiter. The recitatives and turba choruses are drawn from Reinhard Keiser's (1674‚Äì1739) St Mark Passion, which Bach himself had adapted for use in Weimar in 1713 (and which influenced Bach's own St Matthew Passion.) Gomme was the first to utilise Keiser's recitatives, and he paved the way for fuller reconstructions by other scholars. Gomme's reconstruction was recorded in 1998 for ASV Records by the Choir of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and the Cambridge Baroque Camerata, directed by Geoffrey Webber.

It was first published in hardcover by Tor Books in November 1998; a book club edition was issued by Tor in conjunction with the Science Fiction Book Club in April 1999, followed by a paperback edition from Tor. An ebook version was published by Gateway/Orion in September 2011. Plot Earth sends out a spaceship to investigate starfaring in far distance space of which traces have been found. The ship Envoy, manned by a crew of six men and four women, travels at speed close to the speed of light. At the end of the journey the crew meets a Centaur-like species on a planet they call Tahir that has left spacefaring behind. Sentient life is also detected in connection with at a nearby black hole, a reading confirmed by the Tahirans. Their interest aroused, the Earthlings can send a combined crew to investigate. Communications with this \\"Holont\\" is established and much knowledge acquired. Differences aboard the ship, however, lead to the death of three men (Brent, Russek and Cleland), and female pilot Kilbirnie crashes into the black hole. The six Earthlings left drop the Tahirans off at their homeworld and head towards Earth. In between the story jumps regularly back to the development of human society over the gaps of many thousand years and to that of the Kith, the closed group doing the starfaring, who are often shunned by the rest of Earth. The Kith have their own settlements on different planets, where some retire to from time to time. Earth has changed over the long period of time taken up by the voyage of the Envoy, and no one is much interested in spacefaring anymore. On Harbor, a colony of Earth, the Envoy crew finds remainders of the Kith society, which still are connected to spacefaring. But the last ship to plot trade-routes in space, the Fleetwing, disappears from tracking. The cause is a Zero-Zero- failure ripping off the rear part of the ship. The Envoy sets out on a rescue mission as soon as possible but twenty years of outside time have passed by the time they reach the Fleetwing. They save the remaining crew, thus building a foundation of experienced spacefarers to start spacefaring anew with the knowledge acquired from the Holont.

She is well known for her interdisciplinary approach in investigations of globalization, modernity, and citizenship from Southeast Asia and China to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Her notions of 'flexible citizenship', 'graduated sovereignty,' and 'global assemblages' have widely impacted conceptions of the global in modernity across the social sciences and humanities. Her major works include Fungible Life: Experiment in the Asian City of Life (2016), Neoliberalism as Exception: Mutations in Citizenship and Sovereignty (2006), Buddha is Hiding: Refugees, Citizenship, the New America (2003), Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality (1999), Spirits of Resistance and Capitalist Discipline: Factory Women in Malaysia (1987), and the edited volume Global Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological Problems (co-edited with Stephen J. Collier, 2005). Life and career Ong received her B.A. in anthropology (1974) from Barnard College and earned her Ph.D. (1982) in anthropology from Columbia University. She was visiting lecturer at Hampshire College (1982‚Äì84) before joining the Department of Anthropology at the University of California Berkeley (1984 ‚Äì present). She was the Chair of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Berkeley (1999‚Äì2001); was Visiting Professor at City University of Hong Kong (2001), Visiting Professor at Yonsei University (2010), and a senior researcher at the Asia Research Institute of the National University of Singapore (2010). She was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for the study of sovereignty and citizenship (2001-2003) and has been awarded grants from the National Science Foundation and the Sloan Foundation for the Social Science Research Council. She received the Cultural Studies Book Award for Flexible Citizenship (1999) from the Association for Asian American Studies as well as a prize from the American Ethnological Society. She received honorable mention for Buddha is Hiding (2003) from the Society for Urban, National, and Transnational Anthropology. In 2007, Ong was invited to the World Economic Forum in Davos. She was the Chair of the US National Committee for Pacific Science Association from 2009-2011, and was named Robert H. Lowie Distinguished Chair in Anthropology in 2015. She continues to teach, publish, and lecture internationally. Academic work Aihwa Ong's work deals with particular entanglements of politics, technology, ethics and affects in rapidly changing situations on the Asia Pacific rim. Ong approaches research from vantage points outside or athwart the United States. This angle of inquiry unsettles and troubles stabilized viewpoints and units of analysis in the social sciences, such as gender, class, citizenship, cities, sovereignty and the nation-state. As an anthropologist, Ong employs ethnographic observation and analytical concept- work to investigate diverse subjective and institutional effects of the global on emerging situations for ways of being human today. From the novel freedoms and accompanying restrictions experienced by Malaysian female workers in multinational factories to the accumulative strategies of Asian entrepreneurs in relocating family and capital overseas; from the disciplining of Cambodian refugees towards an embrace of American values to the neoliberal reasoning and graduated modes of governing at work; from the transformation of cities to the rise of contemporary art in Asia; Ong's work tracks the interplay of global forces and everyday practices as they crystallize into myriad and uneven contexts for human living and belonging in modernity. Her current work focuses on regimes of governing, technology, and culture that shape new meanings and practices of the human in an emerging global region. Her field research shifts between Singapore and China in order to track emerging global hubs for biotechnical experiments with genomic science in contemporary East Asia.

Enlil, as the tutelary deity of Nippur, had been elevated in prominence and was shown special veneration by the Kassite monarchs, it being the most common theophoric element in their names. This caused the position of the ≈°andabakku to become very prestigious and the holders of the office seem to have wielded influence second only to the king. The office The term ≈°andabakku first appears in texts from Mari, where it seems to represent a high-ranking administrative official, but it is not until the Kassite period that it became synonymous with the city of Nippur. Nippur had been depopulated sometime towards the end of the reign of Samsu-iluna (ca. 1686‚Äì1648 BC, short chronology) and remained abandoned until the end of the fifteenth century when the Kassites began a program of restoration of cultic centers. The earliest inscriptions of this restoration belong to Kurigalzu I. The office may be related in some manner to that of the ni≈°akku (, L√öNU.√à≈†) of Enlil, probably the senior priestly or dignitary position of the Ekur. Whether the post was held concurrently with that of the ≈°andabakku, or at some, perhaps, earlier stage in the career of the prospective governor, has yet to be determined, but it is clear that Enlil-kidinni and his immediate successors, all held both offices, and Amil-Marduk and Enlil-≈°uma-imbƒ´ were similarly honored. Only during the reign of Nazi-Marutta≈°, were they held by separate individuals, with N≈´r-Delebat and his son Ninurta-rƒì·π£u≈°u assuming the ni≈°akku-priest position, the latter of whom naming Enlil-kidinni‚Äôs father Enlil-bƒÅnƒ´ and Amƒ´latum as ancestors, on his clay quadrangular prism,BM 92699, votive prism. a votive dedication to the storm-god Adad.

It is a sequel to Kitano's 2010 film Outrage and is followed by the 2017 film Outrage Coda. Plot summary Five years have passed since the events of Outrage. Otomo, former Yakuza of the Sanno-kai crime syndicate, is presumed dead after being stabbed in prison by Kimura, whose clan Otomo helped destroy. Sekiuchi, chairman of the Sanno-Kai, was assassinated and succeeded by his underboss Kato, who has completely overhauled the syndicate to involve more legitimate businesses and build influence among high-ranking government officials, overseen by Ishihara, Otomo's treasurer and betrayer. However, Kato's emphasis on a system of modernization and profit-based promotion offends and concerns the more senior bosses, who are continually passed over in favor of younger, more profitable members and fear becoming obsolete. The murder of an anti- corruption cop unnerves his colleagues, who know he was investigating corruption on the part of a Land Minister in league with the Sanno-kai. The anti-corruption department decides the Sanno-kai has become dangerously powerful and must be dismantled. To that end, they call in detective Kataoka, whose well-known ties among the yakuza allowed him to orchestrate much of the events of the first film. Corrupt and self-serving, Kataoka decides to instigate a war between the Sanno-Kai and the Hanabishi-kai from western Japan, in the hopes they will destroy each other. He convinces Tomita, one of the most senior and vocally resentful Sanno-kai bosses, to meet with Fuse, chairman of the Osaka branch of the Hanabishi-kai, about forcing Kato to retire. Fuse, concerned Tomita lacks the support needed to mount a takeover, reports him to Kato, who kills him as a lesson to other dissenters. Kataoka turns to Otomo, whose death was just a rumor spread by Kataoka; he has spent the last five years in a maximum security prison. Kimura, his nemesis, has been released and struggles to adjust to civilian life as the owner of a batting cage. Kataoka has Otomo's sentence commuted and secures his early parole, while informing Kato and Ishihara he is still alive. A paranoid Ishihara hires assassins to kill Otomo, while Kataoka has him meet with Kimura. Time has caused the animosity between the two to become remorse, and Kimura expresses interest in joining forces to get revenge on those who betrayed them. Otomo knows they are being manipulated by Kataoka and wants no part of it. He is contacted by a childhood friend, Chang Dae-Sung, who is now an underworld fixer for gangs in both Japan and Korea and offers him a place in his employment; Otomo promises to consider it. When one of Ishihara's assassins nearly kills him, however, Otomo realizes he will never be left alone and agrees to partner with Kimura. With the tacit approval of the Hanabishi-kai, Otomo and Kimura carry out a ruthless and bloody rampage through the ranks of the Sanno-kai. Kato's inability to stop the attacks causes increasing dissent in his syndicate, and the senior bosses are further manipulated by the Hanabishi-kai. Fuse also reveals he knows the truth about Sekiuchi's murder, using it as leverage. Kimura captures Ishihara, whom Otomo ties to a chair to be beaten to death by a pitching machine. Eventually all but a few of the Sanno-Kai bosses demand that Kato retire. Pressured by Fuse, he makes a public statement to the police taking responsibility for the war and Sekiuchi's murder, which is an enormous boost to Kataoka's career. Kimura decides to make a pact with Fuse, but Otomo, warned by Chang that both syndicates deem the two of them expendable, declares himself finished with the war and leaves. Kato, reduced to a mere civilian, is personally assassinated by Otomo at a pachinko parlor. The Sanno-Kai, decimated by the war, is absorbed into the Hanabishi-kai, making it almost omnipotent in central Japan. Chang's warning proves to be true as Kimura is killed by Hanabishi-kai hitmen, after a police raid led by Kataoka leaves him defenseless. The Hanabishi-kai and Sanno-kai bosses gather at his funeral service, observed by Kataoka. Otomo arrives, intending to pay his respects; Kataoka, knowing both clans want Otomo dead, gives him a gun. But by now Otomo knows the war was entirely his doing, and shoots him.

Soundtrack Kitano returned to Keiichi Suzuki, the same Japanese composer he had used for the original Outrage film, for the complete sequel soundtrack, and previously Kitano had collaborated with him for the complete soundtrack to his Zatoichi film. This complete soundtrack for Beyond Outrage was their third film collaboration. Reception Gabe Toro of IndieWire gave Beyond Outrage an \\"A-\\" rating. Justin Chang of Variety described the film as \\"a slow-motion deathtrap in which the wall-to-wall chatter feels like a joyless, too- leisurely distraction from the inevitable bloodletting\\". Meanwhile, he commented that Otomo (Beat Takeshi) is \\"the most memorable figure here, a demon of death shown to brook no nonsense in the film's blunt, perfect final scene\\". Lee Marshall of Screen International said, \\"Out-and-out shouting matches between supposedly composed clan members are another forte of Outrage Beyond ‚Äì a film that always has humour bubbling just underneath its hard- boiled surface\\". Kinema Junpo placed Beyond Outrage at number 3 in their \\"10 Best Japanese Films of 2012\\", while it was ranked at number 36 on the Film Comment's \\"50 Best Undistributed Films of 2012\\". Sequel In September 2012, Takeshi Kitano said that the producers wanted him to make the third Outrage film. As reported by Macnab, the making of a third Outrage film would complete the first film trilogy for Takeshi Kitano. As of 30 June 2013, Box Office Mojo reported a total revenue for Outrage approaching USD ten million with USD 8,383,891 in the total worldwide lifetime box office.

She is a friend and partner of the second Flash Barry Allen. She first appeared in \\"Five-Star Super-Hero Spectacular\\" (DC Special Series #1, September, 1977). Spivot appeared as a recurring cast member on The CW television series second season of The Flash played by Shantel VanSanten. This version is a detective of the Central City Police Department. Fictional character biography Patricia 'Patty' Spivot was the part-time lab assistant to police scientist Barry Allen in the Central City Police Department. She later became the police department's full-time forensic-blood analyst. After David Singh took over the crime lab as director and began to emphasize the quantity of the cases solved over the quality, Patty decided to leave Central City for Blue Valley, Nebraska. Barry attempted to contact Patty to get help on the case of Elongated Kid's death. She was visiting her mother in Keystone City at the time, so she went to the police lab to meet Barry. She told him that she was enjoying her new life in Blue Valley. Wanting to put the past behind her, she asked not to get involved. Barry received a call to another crime scene, and he convinced her to join him. Here, they found a young boy hiding in a shipping container. They brought the boy to the police station to interview as a witness, but he refused to open up to anyone but Patty. Shortly thereafter, the boy revealed himself to her as Professor Zoom, the Reverse- Flash. It was he who had been responsible for the deaths of Elongated Kid and others, and he threatened to kill Patty in the same way, by accelerating her aging process until she died of old age within seconds. However, Flash, Kid Flash, and Hot Pursuit arrived on the scene just in time, saving Patty. Later, Barry went to the police station to see if Patty was okay. Patty revealed to Barry that she planned to return to Blue Valley, but Barry tried to convince her to stay. Then, Patty revealed to Barry her unrequited crush on him. Surprised by this, Barry tells her that he will always be her friend and asks her to think about staying in Central City, and Patty promises she will. But in that moment, Iris comes in, and Patty, trying to avoid an awkward moment, leaves. =Flashpoint= Patty, wanting to do something bigger with her life, stole the former Hot Pursuit's gear from the Central City Police Department evidence locker, which was set to be transported to the Justice League, becoming the new Hot Pursuit. Escaping from a group of cops in her Cosmic Motorcycle, Patty went to a rooftop. Suddenly, her bike detected a timestorm and initiated an emergency chronal-evac, transporting her to the year 3011. There, she was captured by Brainiac's forces and placed in a hibernation chamber, where she was forced to relive her worst memory: drowning to death for a few minutes in a pool when she was a kid. However, she managed to escape. Later, she helps Kid Flash (Bart Allen) escape from Brainiac, Earth's ruler in 3011. After they get to safety, Patty reveals her identity to him and explains that they are in the 31st century. Kid Flash tells her that he was born in the 31st century and it is nothing like the 31st century he was born in, so something must have changed in the timeline. Patty tells him that her bike can travel through time but only if it has the Speed Force tank, so Kid Flash agrees to find it. Kid Flash tells her that they must get back to the past and fix the timeline. Then, Kid Flash takes off his glove and shows that his right hand has lost its skin and it only has muscles and bone. Patty reveals to Kid Flash how she became Hot Pursuit. Bart takes Patty's helmet and uses it to see how much was the timeline changed. Suddenly, the two are attacked by Brainiac's probes, but they escape using the Cosmic Motorcycle. Hiding in an abandoned building, they decide to enter Brainiac's fortress to obtain the Speed Force tank. Bart lets himself be captured by Brainiac, who places him in a virtual reality chamber. Inside the chamber Bart manages to rewrite several of Brainiac's programs, including his security systems. This allows Patty to enter the citadel and rescue Kid Flash. They manage to find the Speed Force tank, but Brainiac impales Patty in the chest with his claws. Enraged, Bart attacks him while Patty obtains the tank. Using her last moments, Patty smashes the tank in front of Bart, allowing him to regain his speed. Patty dies and her body is taken by Brainiac. Bart escapes to the past, promising to save her. =The New 52= Flash managed to change reality and create a new universe, bringing Patty back to life. In this new reality, Barry never marries with Iris West and enters a relationship with Patty. After the Future Flash incident, she breaks up with Barry and is never seen in the comics since. In other media Shantel VanSanten as Patricia \\"Patty\\" Spivot in The Flash Patty Spivot appears in season two of The Flash, portrayed by Shantel VanSanten. Here, she is a uniformed police officer rather than a lab assistant. She intended to become a C.S.I. investigator, but put that aside when her father was murdered by Mark Mardon and joined the regular police force. She has a deep hatred for Mardon that comes from survivor's guilt; when she was a teenager, she was supposed to make the bank deposit that Mardon killed her father over. She harbors no ill will towards metahumans (her father was killed before the particle accelerator explosion that empowered the Mardon brothers), but believes that metahumans can be either good or bad, and should be stopped if necessary.

It has a built-in 1.5 frames per second motor drive, center-weighted TTL metering, multiple automatic exposure modes, and a small LCD screen on the top plate which indicates mode, exposure compensation, and exposure count. Unlike comparable medium-format cameras, the 645 does not have an interchangeable back system. Instead, the film is loaded into holders, which are then inserted into the rear of the camera. The holders cannot be removed until an entire roll is shot. The crop factor vs. a 35 mm camera is .62, The actual film image is 2.7 times larger than that of standard double format 35mm film. =645N= Pentax 645N with 75 mm lens In 1997, a significantly redesigned model was introduced. The 645N incorporated an auto-focus system, and most of the 645 lenses were upgraded to match. The new model also featured matrix metering, film-edge data imprinting, and a self-timer. The imprinted data on the edge of every image includes the frame number, exposure mode, shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation value, metering mode, and lens focal length. The controls and LCD on the top plate were significantly changed, and the motor drive was increased to 2 frames per second.https://www.shutterbug.com/content/pentax-645n-autofocusing-comes- medium-format-slr =645NII= Pentax 645NII with 45 mm lens The 645NII was introduced in 2001.

Early years Juel attended the Sor√∏ Academy from 1590 to 1596, and then had a seven-year educational trip with studies abroad, ending in 1603 when he became employed at the Danish chancery. He advanced quickly, being given major tasks: Danish Treasury (responsible for accounting, payment and collection of customs duties and taxes, as well as management of state property, including forests, roads and buildings) beginning in 1609, member of the Danish national council from 1616 and assignment to serve on several diplomatic missions. Governor-general of Norway  In 1618, he was named Governor-general of Norway which included the traditional role as feudal lord to Akershus in Norway. Juel proved to be an energetic and active governor, both on the Crown‚Äôs and on his own behalf. King Christian IV was occupied with the Thirty Years' War which left Juel with substantial latitude to apply his own judgment. He enacted a garrison tax in 1627, which financed the manning of fortresses at Akershus, B√•hus, Bergen and Trondheim, and served as the foundation of an independent Norwegian defense organization, based on a strengthened peasant militia. A similar attempt at developing Norwegian naval strength was, however, rejected by the king. AS feudal lord of Akershus Juel established the new city of Christiania when Oslo burnt in 1624. The new city was a relatively Danish-dominated city, serving as refuge for a network of immigrant merchants, especially from Haderslev, which was destroyed by war in 1627. Juel actively expanded mining operations in Norway, and served as the first director of the Kongsberg Silver Mines. The Silver Works was originally a 100% state-owned enterprise, but financial difficulties resulting from the DanishNorwegian intervention in the Thirty Years' War, resulted in sale of shares to a private company in 1628, with the state as one of the part-owners. Juel was head of the private partnership that bought a share of the silver mine. Juel was also active in husbanding his private wealth through lending while he served in Oslo, gaining ownership of a number of Norwegian estates, and also acquiring lands in Denmark. Family  His father was Herman Juel (1548‚Äì1607) and Maren Juel. On 13 May 1610 in Viborg, Denmark, he married Ide Lange (1584‚Äì1649), the daughter of Hans Lange (1542‚Äì1609) of Brejning and Johanne Skram (?-1620). Juel and Ide Hansdatter Lange had a daughter, Christence Juel, who was born on 12 August 1637. She married J√∏rgen Rosenkrantz (born 1607).

Its interior includes a luxurious hall, a spacious dining room, and an interior courtyard.Museo Castillo Serrall√©s Administration The museum is administered and operated by a non-governmental, non-profit, civic organization called Patronato de Ponce. The organization received an endowment from the Ponce Municipal Government of $600,000 a year during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, but due to the worldwide economic downturn the Municipality dropped its endowment to $300,000 per year in 2010. It had also been receiving an undisclosed amount in yearly donations from the private sector, but $75,000 of that was also dropped due to the economy. The museum operates with a $1.2M yearly budget. Displays and tours Access to the museum is through the side patio/balcony entrance on the southern end of the building. The museum can only be seen via guided group tours, and tour guides are very diligent in efforcing this rule as the administration does not want visitors wandering around the house on their own. The only on-your-own time comes at the gift shop. The museum has four floors, and the displays on each floor focus on a particular aspect of the museum and the lives of its former owners. The ground floor, which is the castle's former basement, houses all of the museum's rum and sugar-related expositions. On its northern end is the castle's former 3-car garage now turned into the museum's gift shop. This level also houses the main entrance to the museum on its southern end. On the main, center area are the former service quarters which used to house mechanical, electrical, and water storage facilities. These have been remodeled to provide for the turnstile entry, a restaurant, and an auditorium capable of sitting some 50 visitors. There are also some Patronato offices on this floor.Patronato de Ponce The second floor contains the castle owner's former library, a central patio, a solarium, the living room, dining room, and the kitchen.

Authorized by the Norwegian Postal system as a bona fide post office, eligible for collection and processing of letters, it is the only dry underwater post office in the world; other underwater post offices operate in wet environments. It is in operation during the summer months, as this period coincides with the tourist season as well as the warmer climate. History The post office during launch. Conceived by the local SCUBA diving club, the underwater post office was established June 4, 2004. It was placed at a depth of 4 metres next to a pier designed to accommodate large ships, a pier which also houses the local Aquarium. Initially a success, the number of letters dwindled after the first few years. As the work (and cost) involved with the running of the post office began to take its toll, the closure of the office was decided and the 2011 season was to be its last in service. However, the town's tourism board and local businesses offered their support and persuaded the divers to continue the tradition. From its opening in 2004 to 2011, the underwater postmaster was H√•kon Sandvik; from 2012 onwards Tore Bj√∏rn Hovde has the responsibility. Both are members of the local SCUBA diving club. Other members also contribute periodically. Structure The post office is a form of diving bell constructed in fiberglass, and is filled with air so that the mail stays dry. The structure is moored to the bottom by a 5-ton weight. Operation Visitors can post their mail in a post box by the pier and this is then emptied two to three times per week. The postmaster takes the mail down to the post office by means of a watertight bag. Inside, the mail is stamped before it is returned to the surface. It is then entered into normal post circulation. Mail sent Postmaster Haakon Sandvik stamping cards. Records are kept by the postmaster, detailing the numbers of cards and letters that are sent through the underwater post office.

Background The film stars James Woods as Walter Farmer and John Lithgow as Artie Margulies. Others in the film include Joanna Gleason as Marie, Eve Gordon as Amanda, Alan Rosenberg as the psychiatrist and Rosemary Dunsmore as Helene.The Boys (1991) (TV) - Full cast and crew Today, the film remains out-of-print in America, having never received a VHS or DVD release. In the UK, where the film was re-titled The Guys, the movie was released on VHS via CIC Video, where it has remained out- of-print. The film's tagline reads \\"Artie has a nasty habit...Walter can't live with it. A story of love, life & cigarettes.\\"http://ecx.images- amazon.com/images/I/41Y2mDcGjXL.jpg The Boys was created by production companies Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment International and William Link Productions.The Boys (TV Movie 1991) - Company credits - IMDb  Writing and filming  The film was largely inspired by the lives of the film's writer William Link and his writing partner, Richard Levinson, and Levinson's death. However, the key plot point of the story didn't happen in reality. In real- life, Richard Levinson was the smoker.The Boys (TV Movie 1991) - Trivia - IMDb A day before the original broadcast on the ABC Network, an article with the Los Angeles Times was based on the film, under the headline \\"'Til Death Do They Part\\". The article stated that writer Link used to say his relationship with long-time writing partner Levinson was like marriage without the sex. The story was written by Link as a sort of private therapy to get over Levinson's death. In the article, it is mentioned that neither Woods or Lithgow worry about taking time out of their film careers to do a TV film. \\"Each of us looks for good material. And a lot of good material today is written for television,\\" said Lithgow, whilst Woods stated \\"There's always been great material on television\\". In the article, it is stated that the film was the first TV movie to deal directly with the issue of secondary smoke, although both leading actors insisted that The Boys was not a network disease-of-the- week movie. \\"The secondary smoke is certainly an important aspect of the story,\\" Lithgow said. \\"One man is dying because the other man smokes. It's an important little turn of the plot, but it's sort of the last thing I think about. This is not an advocacy film, in my mind, at all.\\" \\"But (secondary smoke) is the motor of the story,\\" Woods said. \\"It's the deus ex machina, if you will, that propels the story. It causes this almost repressed friendship to finally blossom. It's that terrible reality in life that sometimes we only are able to express our love to people when we're losing them or have lost them.\\" It was also stated that in a short time, Lithgow and Woods said they developed the kind of comic rapport and unspoken bond that Levinson and Link shared. The repartee is evident as they tell how Lithgow was chosen for The Boys. Originally, after Woods was cast in the film, the filmmakers then searched for the best person to play Woods' partner. Woods stated in the Los Angeles Times article \\"I told my agent to close his eyes and imagine the best person to play Arty, and I'll do the same thing. And we both came up with Mickey Rooney, but he wasn't available. After, we went for Andy Rooney, and then Andy Garcia, then finally John. But John was doing The Last Elephant at the time.\\" \\"I was off in Africa,\\" Lithgow said. \\"You couldn't phone in and you couldn't get calls out, but somehow or other a faxed script arrived on my bed one night by a carrier caribou.\\" Describing the acting in the film, Lithgow stated \\"The first time I saw James was in a student production of Jean-Paul Sartre's The Victors, when he was 19 years old, even back then, I'd heard an awful lot about him and his work process. We work in a very, very similar way, which is perfect for this movie.\\" Woods added \\"It's a sort of shorthand\\". \\"Very fast,\\" Lithgow said. \\"In fact, the relationship between these two writers is so easy and fun for us to play because that's very much like our collaborative relationship as actors. We have already devised a thousand little tricks. His mind just whirs along, and I love to keep pace with it.\\" According to the article, Woods and Lithgow were immediately looking for a new project together after The Boys. \\"We have the same agency, so we told our agents to put their heads together on our behalf,\\" Lithgow said. \\"And they'll probably come up with some fabulous script, and then give it to Redford and Newman,\\" Woods said. Both Woods and Lithgow wouldn't work together again. In a mid-April 1991 article with Ocala Star-Banner, writer Link spoke of the film's story and the writing of the script. \\"Call it therapy. I had mentioned this concept to Dick several years before he died, but he did not want to write it. I asked him why, and he said \\"you guess\\". I don't think he wanted to be under scrutiny in promoting the show, with people asking him, \\"Why are you chain- smoking in this interview when you just produced a movie that is against it?\\" A week after Dick died in 1987, I was at ABC with Brandon Stoddard (the network's former programming chief). He said \\"What have your got for us?\\" I told him this idea, he thought it was terrific, and he said I had an on-the- air commitment. He also said \\"I think it'll be very good therapy for you.\\" Dick and I had written every line together. I was used to working in a room with my best friend for 41 years, and when he died, I felt stranded. I was very fearful that I couldn't write, because my crutch wasn't there anymore. It was as if I'd had an amputation, and it took me about 10 months to get around to this. In four two-day weekends, I wrote \\"The Boys,\\" and it just poured out. It was like someone was dictating it to me.\\" In the same article, Link spoke of how any worries of writing solo were soothed considerably with the signing of the two central roles to Woods and Lithgow. \\"It's rare in this business that you get two people who are so dedicated to the material. They wouldn't change one syllable, and they treated the script like Biblical text. That's amazing, because sometimes, you work with people who learn their dialogue right on the set while the director is blocking the shot.\\" In the article, Woods also stated that he believed that The Boys is \\"very lighthearted in its approach to a very serious subject. It's a very odd piece, but in the best sense of that term. It's not a structured three-act story, but a pastiche of the relationship of these two wonderful men who loved each other for so long. Some of it's very funny and some of it's very sad, but finally, it's like a two-hour window into this long relationship. It's a real love letter from Bill Link to his friendship with Dick Levinson.\\"Ocala Star-Banner - Google News Archive Search Plot Walter and Artie are almost married. They've churned out scripts for movies and TV shows for 20 years, and as writing partners, they have shared a lifetime of experience, experiences that include Artie's three packs of cigarettes a day. Despite his squeaky clean lifestyle, now Walter has lung cancer, where he is given six months to live, and his life is literally going up in Artie's smoke. As Walter fights cancer he also tries to put his affairs in order by teaching writing to prison inmates, talking to his son and ex-wife, and getting his partner to quit smoking.The Boys (1991) (TV) - Plot Summary Cast * James Woods as Walter Farmer * John Lithgow as Artie Margulies * Joanna Gleason as Marie * Eve Gordon as Amanda * Alan Rosenberg as the Psychiatrist * Rosemary Dunsmore as Helene * Albert Hall (uncredited role) * Rosanna Huffman as Carolyn * Natalia Nogulich as Denise * John Vickery as Dr. Simon * Ebbe Roe Smith as Sokalow * George Wallace as Ray * Jesse Bradford as Walter Farmer Jr. * Alma Martinez as the Therapist  Critical reception  Reportedly, upon release, the film was highly acclaimed. Allmovie gave the film three out of five stars and wrote \\"The Boys is an \\"a clef\\" celebration of the famed script writing team of Richard Levinson and William Link. Link himself wrote this story about two lifelong collaborator/friends. Some observers have suggested that Link penned this tale more out of guilt than friendship; whatever the case, he wisely avoids overloading the material with sentiment, allowing the \\"boys\\" to kid around and squabble as much as they ever had. As a bonus, there's a Columbo-style mystery angle in the proceedings to keep the hard-core Levinson/Link fans happy.\\" Around the time of the original broadcasting, Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a C grade and wrote \\"Woods and Lithgow spend the length of the movie examining their friendship and talking, talking, talking. Although Woods has a girlfriend and Lithgow a wife, much of The Boys operates like a two-character play. The Boys is an exhausting, all-too-cleverly-crafted tragicomedy. The TV movie was written by William Link, who for years wrote and produced scripts with his partner, Richard Levinson. Levinson died in 1987; The Boys is clearly Link's salute to his collaborator and friend. This noble, heartfelt gesture has yielded a sentimental story.\\" Sky Movies gave a favorable review, stating \\"This TV movie will be of interest to anyone who has ever sat through a Columbo case or a Murder, She Wrote mystery. It tells the story of the final months in the life of their creator Richard Levinson as he fought lung cancer. It was penned by his partner-in-crime William Link, which makes it all the more poignant. Given the subject matter, The Boys is surprisingly funny. The plot bubbles along nicely and only puts a foot wrong when it tries to be clever or ends up a touch melodramatic. But Artie and Walter emerge as real flesh and blood characters and no-one can doubt the depth of feelings harboured by Link for his late colleague or the pain at his loss.\\" Around the time of the original broadcasting, Chicago Tribune gave an unfavorable review, writing \\"As a two- hour anti-smoking advertisement, The Boys is an effective message. As a two- hour homage from one-half of a famous screenwriting team to his dead partner, The Boys is an affectionate tribute. But as a showcase for the talents of two fine actors, John Lithgow and James Woods, The Boys is a bust, just as it is as entertainment or tearjerker. Sure, it's well-intentioned. William Link who, along with the late Richard Levinson, created such hits as Columbo, Mannix and Murder, She Wrote, obviously means this film as a memorial to Levinson. But filled with a shocking playfulness, the film doesn't delineate, in any interesting fashion, the nature of the friendship or the pain of its end. Woods and Lithgow are forced to behave like rambunctious, emotionally shackled toddlers. Surely there are people who behave with such virtue, who try to tidy their lives. Perhaps this is really the way Levinson behaved. But here it has a forced ring, at once too giddy and righteous.\\" Around the time of the original broadcasting, Lawrence Journal-World gave an unfavorable review, stating '\\"Take two first-rate character actors, the prodigiously talented John Lithgow and James Woods. Give them a script unworthy of their powers. Watch their light blast through the holes in it like laser beams. The film has its moments, to be sure, but mostly it's the pleasure of watching these two pros at work. The Boys is somewhere between drama and black comedy, a modified Felix-and-Oscar story hinged on passive smoking, cancer and male bonding.\\"' References External links * 1991 television films 1991 films 1990s drama films English-language films Films directed by Glenn Jordan American television films American films ABC Motion Pictures films ","title":"The Boys (1991 film)"},{"id":"36570357","text":"Francesco Paolo Manassero Zegarra (born April 12, 1964 in Lima, Peru), known as Francesco Manassero, is a Peruvian retired footballer.

He was particularly well known for his works on the life and thought of Mao Zedong. Biography Schram was born in Excelsior, Minnesota, a small lake town outside of Minneapolis, in 1924. His parents, both of whom had professional careers, divorced when he was very young. Schram enrolled at the University of Minnesota, and graduated magna cum laude in 1944. After graduation he was drafted into the US army, and was assigned to work on the Manhattan Project in Chicago, as a member of the team responsible for developing of an atomic bomb. Schram's work on the project involved devising information storage systems for the vast amounts of data generated. After the end of World War II, influenced by his involvement on the development of the atomic bomb, he decided to change his focus of academic study, and enrolled at Columbia University in New York where he studied for a PhD in political science. He went to France to carry out research for his dissertation on the political behavior of French Protestants, and after receiving his PhD he moved to France. Lattimore (Amsterdam, 1967)262x262px In the early 1950s, Schram wrote several articles on East and West Berlin. Although these articles were not overtly supportive of the East German regime, they drew the attention of the U.S. State Department, which withdrew his passport. After multiple letters to Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey, Schram regained his passport in 1955. From 1954 to 1967 he carried out research at the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques in Paris, but as a non-French citizen he could not become a Professor or oversee doctoral dissertations. During the late 1950s he turned his attention to Chinese politics, and started to learn Chinese so that he could base his research on the primary sources. He focused his research on Chairman Mao, and by 1963 he had completed a book on the Political Thought of Mao Tse-tung. In 1966 Penguin Books published his seminal biography of Mao. These works made him prominent in the emerging field of modern China studies. The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London offered Schram a chair. Once established in London, Schram led establishment of the Contemporary China Institute and the continued development of journal, China Quarterly. He also translated a large number of unofficial writings by Mao which had been released by zealous Red Guard groups in China in 1967-1968 during the Cultural Revolution. In 1989 he retired from his position at SOAS, and moved back to America. He was in Beijing in May 1989, when he provided analysis to the British Embassy and predicted that Deng Xiaoping would crack down on the students in Tiananmen Square violently. At the invitation of Roderick MacFarquhar, Director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, he started work on the translation and editing of a ten-volume collection of the revolutionary writings of Mao Zedong, seven volumes of which were published before his death. An eighth volume was published in 2015. He died in France in July 2012 after a stroke. He was survived by his wife Marie-Annick Lancelot, who he married in 1972, and his son, Arthur. Legacy Schram made a huge impact on Western understanding of Mao during the 1960s and 1970s. Both his translations of new materials along with his interpretation of officially-available sources from Beijing provided insights to government analysts and readers in the general public. However, in the view of his colleague and fellow Mao scholar, Roderick MacFarquhar, Schram wrestled with the problem of making any overall assessment of Mao. MacFarquar recalls Schram saying ‚ÄúI agree with the current Chinese view that Mao‚Äôs merits outweighed his faults, but it is not easy to put a figure on the positive and negative aspects. How does one weigh, for example, the good fortune of hundreds of millions of peasants in getting land against the execution, in the course of land reform and the 'Campaign against Counter- Revolutionaries,' or in other contexts, of millions, some of whom certainly deserved to die, but others of whom undoubtedly did not? How does one balance the achievements in economic development during the first Five-Year Plan, or during the whole twenty-seven years of Mao‚Äôs leadership after 1949, against the starvation which came in the wake of the misguided enthusiasm of the Great Leap Forward, or the bloody shambles of the Cultural Revolution?‚Äù Schram added, ‚ÄúIn the last analysis, however, I am more interested in the potential future impact of his thought than in sending Mao as an individual to Heaven or to Hell.‚Äù Commenting on Schram's Mao biography and his The Political Thought of Mao Tse-tung, Harvard scholar Tony Saich observed: ‚ÄúI do not think he got Mao wrong but his analysis was very much text-based and this meant that he did not focus so much on the hard politics that Mao engaged in.‚Äù Schram's writings on Mao Zedong were translated into French and German during the 1960s and 1970s, and his work on Mao Zedong had a kind of revival in the People's Republic of China in the 1990s and thereafter.

It is the newest part of what is a new city itself, with the first building completed only in 2005. Although Almere is a planned city, Almere Poort was not in the original city plans, but is rather a result of revised urban planning in accordance to Almere's more recent development plans assuming much higher target population and more prominent role as a satellite urban centre to Amsterdam. Almere Poort is located on the western bank of the IJmeer, with the Almeerderstrand beach forming the borough's (as well as municipality's and province's) western boundary. It borders Almere Haven to the south, Almere Stad to the east and the yet-undeveloped (as of 2012) designated district of Almere Pampus to the North. The A6 motorway runs along the borough's southern border, with one exit at Poortdreef and one at Hogering, the latter of which runs along the eastern border. The Flevolijn railway line runs semi-diagonally across the borough, with local trains stopping at the borough's station Almere Poort railway station. The former Almere Strand railway station, which was serviced only during events at Almeerderstrand, was also within the boundaries of Almere Poort. It was demolished in 2012. Since then, buses run between Almere Poort station and Almeerderstrand during events. Almere Poort differs from the other boroughs and districts in that residential development does not follow the model typical for other districts of Almere, which is mostly large-scale single- family housing developments built according to a common plan. Contrary to this, the district features both high-density apartment buildings, as well as land parcels available for free private housing development. Also contrary to older districts of Almere, Almere-Poort refers to its residential areas as kwartieren rather than wijken. The designated parts of Almere Poort according to the official website of the municipality are: # Homeruskwartier - featuring land plots for private housing development, with streets named after mythological beings and characters featured in the works of Homer # Europakwartier - consisting of large-scale apartment buildings with an urban atmosphere, divided by the railway tracks into Europakwartier-West and Europakwartier-Oost. The street naming after European countries generally follows the east-west geographic location of countries # Columbuskwartier - this residential district has streets named after famous explorers such as Christopher Columbus himself # Olympiakwartier and Olympia Office Park are to be constructed around the Almere Poort railway station to form the district's multi-functional and prestigious centre. # Duin which will feature beach condo's and sand hills close to the beach of Almeerderstrand and Marina Muiderzand. # Cascadepark - a park between Homeruskwartier and Europakwartier with its first trees planted in 2008 # Kustzone - the coastal zone along the Almeerderstrand is designated for mixed development, including residential buildings, hotels, leisure facilities and some commerce # Hogekant - this commercial area in the Western extremity of the district is designated for industrial use, mostly by small and mid-sized enterprises in the craft and service sectors # Middenkant - separated with a canal from the Hogekant is to provide a more high-quality neighbourhood for SMEs # Lagekant - this commercial area is designated for large and international companies in the service sector  External links  * Almere Poort's section of the official webpage of the municipality of Almere Poort Populated places in Flevoland Populated places established in the 2000s ","title":"Almere Poort"},{"id":"36570474","text":"Ma Zengyu (Chinese: È©¨Â¢ûÁéâ; born 7 May 1983 in Shenyang, Liaoning) is a Chinese basketball player.

As much scholarly attention had already been given to the Hebrew Bible and the Pseudepigrapha, it was decided to begin with texts from the post-biblical period. The database thus reflects more than 2000 years of Hebrew writing. Such a project requires a large textual database, and the HDP was one of the first in the world to develop and use a computerized concordance.

His only full-blooded brother Tu'ukitau had died at the age of four in 1842. He was named Siaosi or George after his father, who in turn had taken the name in honor of King George III of the United Kingdom while his mother was named SƒÅlote or Charlotte after Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Prince Vuna's half-siblings include Tƒìvita  ªUnga and SƒÅlote Mafile ªo Pilolevu, who were repudiated by their father as illegitimate offspring along with their mothers, who were his secondary consorts, after his marriage in 1834 to Prince Vuna's mother under Christian rites. His mother was the former wife of Laufilitonga, the last Tu ªi Tonga, and his maternal great-great grandmother was Nanasipau ªu, who held the high rank of Tu ªi Tonga Fefine. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Prince Vuna died in January 1862, unmarried, leaving his father without an heir. His death was greatly mourned by the people of Tonga. At the prince's funeral, the King allowed his subjects to restore the traditional rite of tukuofo, the offering of mats and food to the dead. This gesture prompted the presiding Reverend William George Richard Stephinson to openly reprimand the King and discipline the native participants resulting in a rift between the King and the Wesleyan Church. The succession would remain vacant for thirteen years until the promulgation of Tonga's first constitution in 1875, which legitimized Vuna's half-brother Tƒìvita  ªUnga and named him Crown Prince.

He participated in the Paraguay Expedition, fought in the Mexican War and American Civil War, and served briefly as commander of the Asiatic Squadron. Naval career Lewis was born on 30 January 1826 in Washington, D.C.. He was appointed as a midshipman in October 1841 and immediately was attached to the sloop-of-war , which was fitting out at Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, at the time. Before Warren could put to sea, however, Lewis was transferred to the receiving ship at the navy yard, remaining aboard her for a few months. In 1842, he was attached to the sloop-of-war , and served aboard her until 1845 off the coast of Africa and in the West Indies Squadron.Hamersly, 1870, p. 123.Hamersly, 1878, p. 138.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900. =Mexican War= Lewis next reported to the sloop- of-war at Norfolk, Virginia, and served aboard her in the Pacific Squadron from 1845 to 1848. Aboard Cyane, he took part in the Mexican War, seeing action in the capture of San Diego, California ‚Äì then a part of Mexico ‚Äì the destruction of a Mexican artillery battery at San Blas, the seizure of La Paz in Baja California, and the bombardment of Guaymas in Sonora, where Cyane cut out the Mexican brig Condor while under fire from Mexican troops and artillery ashore and burned the small Mexican fleet there. Cyane went on to clear the Gulf of California of Mexican ships over the course of the next month and participated in the capture of Mazatl√°n before relieving the siege by Mexican troops and Yaqui Indians of San Jos√© del Cabo. Upon Cyanes return to the United States at the conclusion of the war in 1848, United States Secretary of the Navy John Y. Mason congratulated her crew for their significant contribution to the American victory.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: Cyane II =1848‚Äì1861= After returning to the United States, Lewis reported to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1848 and passed his examination. Sources differ on the date of his promotion to passed midshipman, stating both that it came on 10 August 1847 while he was aboard Cyane and that it was in 1849 after he passed his examination at the Naval Academy. In 1849, Lewis went aboard the steamer , aboard which he cruised in the West Indies and along the Spanish Main. In 1850, he transferred to the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., for a few months, then in 1851 detached to serve aboard commercial steamers of the Collins Line on two or three transatlantic voyages between New York City and Liverpool, England. In 1852 he began an 18-month tour aboard the sloop-of-war , in service at the time as a training ship at the Naval Academy, then reported to the brig , which was fitting out at the Norfolk Navy Yard at the time. Before Dolphin sailed, he transferred in 1853 to the stores ship , which was fitting out at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. During his two years aboard Supply, he was promoted to master on 14 September 1855 and to lieutenant the following day, but he detached from Supply in 1855 before she embarked on the first of her two voyages to the Mediterranean to bring camels from the Ottoman Empire home to the United States for experimental use by the United States Armys Camel Corps.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: Supply I After a short leave period, Lewis was assigned to the receiving ship at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1856. He transferred to the new sailing frigate in 1858 and served aboard her during a three-year cruise, during which she took part in the Paraguay Expedition and operated in the West Indies. =American Civil War= Lewis was aboard Sabine when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. He spent his last few months aboard Sabine on duty in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America, serving in the blockade of Pensacola, Florida. He commanded a group of boats which carried reinforcements to Fort Pickens under threat from Confederate Fort McRae and was made executive officer of Sabine. After Sabine was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, later in 1861, Lewis took a leave of absence from the Navy, but returned to service later in the year as executive officer of the steamer in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1862. In 1862, Lewis became commanding officer of the gunboat on the Mississippi River, leading her in action at Man Shack Bend. Itasca later was reassigned to the blockade of Texas, where Lewis led her in an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery at Velasco, in the capture of two blockade runners, and in running aground and destroying two or three other blockade runners. After Itasca was ordered north to undergo repairs in 1863, Lewis was detached from her and took a short leave of absence.Hamersly, 1878, pp. 138-139. Upon returning to service, Lewis spent three months at Baltimore, Maryland, to oversee the repair and fitting out of ships there, then was sent to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1864, where he commanded successively the bark , the gunboat , the sidewheel steamer , and the monitor in the blockade of Charleston, South Carolina, and on the St. Johns River. He was in command of Nantucket when she closed to destroy a stranded blockade runner with gunfire off Charleston and engaged the Confederate artillery batteries on Sullivan's Island, as well as during later duty at Port Royal, South Carolina, when Nantucket guarded the receiving ship in case New Hampshire was targeted by the Confederate States Navy ironclad CSS Stonewall. After the Civil War ended in April 1865, Lewis brought Nantucket to Philadelphia, where she was laid up.Hamersly, 1878, p. 139. =Post-Civil War= In 1865, Lewis joined the staff of the Naval Academy, first as senior instructor in seamanship and later as superintendent of grounds and buildings, and was promoted to commander on 29 January 1867. From 1869 to 1871 he commanded the steamer in the Pacific Squadron, then was on the Board of Inspectors from 1871 to 1874. He served in the Asiatic Squadron from 1874 to 1875, first in command of the gunboat and then in command of the sloop-of-war , and he temporarily served as commander of the entire squadron from 24 June to 16 August 1875.

The film is an updated comedic adaptation of the Faust legend, borrowing elements from two stage f√©erie spectaculars: Les Pilules du diable (1839), a classic stage fantasy with knockabout comedy, and Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable (1905), a satirical update of Les Pilules du diable to which M√©li√®s had contributed two sequences, one of which he incorporated into the present film. In addition to directing and acting in it, M√©li√®s supervised all aspects of the film's design and trick effect work, including extensive use of stage machinery, in his lavishly individual style, which was already unusual in the mass production-dominated French film industry. The film follows the adventures of an ambitious engineer who abandons his family and responsibilities when he barters with the Devil (played by M√©li√®s himself) for superhuman powers. The engineer is forced to face the unexpected consequences of his barter, including a dizzying ride through the sky.  Summary  A partly hand-colored print of the film An English engineer and inventor, William Crackford, is visited in his workshop by a messenger, who tells him that the famous alchemist Alcofrisbas is interested in selling him a powerful talisman. Arriving in Alcofrisbas's mysterious laboratory, where they are attacked and confused by magically moving and transforming pieces of furniture, Crackford and his servant John explain to the alchemist that they hope to make a high-speed trip around the world. Alcofrisbas promises to make the trip possible. With the help of his seven laboratory assistants, Alcofrisbas makes a batch of large magical pills for the engineer and demonstrates that, by hurling a pill upon the ground, Crackford can have any wish gratified. Crackford, in his excitement, does not read the terms of the contract he is asked to sign, and so remains blissfully unaware that he has just sold his soul to the Devil. When Crackford and John leave, \\"Alcofrisbas\\" resumes his true identity‚ÄîMephistopheles‚Äîand his \\"assistants\\" are revealed to be the Seven Deadly Sins. Crackford comes home to dinner, where his wife and daughters are waiting for him. Wanting to try out the pills, he throws one to the floor. Immediately, two servants in livery burst out of a trunk, opening it to reveal more servants and a smaller trunk, who open it to reveal still more servants and another trunk, and so on; the process goes on until the dining room is full of servants, who load all of Crackford's furniture, as well as Crackford himself and his family, into the trunks. In the blink of an eye the trunks become a miniature train for the family, driven by John the servant. Crackford's high-speed tour has begun. The tiny train wends its way out of the city, meeting with ridicule from onlookers. Arriving in the countryside, most of the train and all of Crackford's family are lost in an accident with a collapsing bridge; Crackford, caring only for his world tour, continues on undismayed. Crackford and John stop at a village inn, the landlord of which is again Mephistopheles in disguise. The two travelers find their attempts to eat confounded by magical disappearances and transformations; in despair, they go to the kitchen to eat with the servants, only to be disrupted by apes and demons in a farcical pandemonium of appearances and disappearances using every possible entrance and exit. Fleeing out of the inn, the travelers make an escape in a horse and buggy, which Mephistopheles promptly transforms into a magical carriage made out of stars and comets and drawn by a bizarre mythological horse. Mephistopheles, following the travelers in an automobile, drives them up the slope of Mount Vesuvius and directly into an eruption. In a burst of lava and flames, the infernal carriage is shot into the sky and makes a voyage through space, flying past stars and planets. Colliding with a thunderstorm, the carriage bursts apart; Crackford and John tumble through space and crash through the ceiling of a dining room. Just as Crackford thinks he is about to get a bite to eat at last, Mephistopheles appears to fulfill the terms of the contract. Crackford is led into the Underworld, where gleeful demons turn him on a spit over the infernal flames.  Background  Stereoscope image of a scene from Les Pilules du diable On 16 February 1839, Les Pilules du diable, a stage spectacular written by Ferdinand Laloue, Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois and Clement-Philippe Laurent, premiered at the Th√©√¢tre National de Cirque- Olympique in Paris. The play was frequently revived and became accepted as one of the classics of the f√©erie genre, a popular French genre known for its lavish production values and fantasy plots. The play follows a bizarre, extended, and supernatural chase in which two young lovers, Isabelle and Albert, must constantly flee from a rich hidalgo, Sottinez, who is vying for Isabelle's hand in marriage. A new adaptation of the classic play, Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable by Victor de Cottens and Victor Darlay, premiered on 23 December 1905 at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. This version of the play, though still in the f√©erie tradition of elaborately staged fantasy, introduced a modernized setting as well as an element of skeptical satire to the story.Ginisty, pp. 216‚Äì217. The De Cottens‚ÄìDarlay version focused on a Good Genie who travels to Earth to fight the Devil; he soon becomes entangled in a search for three magic charms that the Devil intends to use as supernatural powers. M√©li√®s had previously worked with De Cottens on the 1904 Folies Berg√®re revue, for which M√©li√®s produced a satirical film sequence about Leopold II of Belgium; the sequence was screened at three hundred performances of the revue, and was later released commercially by M√©li√®s's studio as An Adventurous Automobile Trip. For Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable, De Cottens and Darlay commissioned M√©li√®s to make two short films to be projected as part of the entertainment. One of these, for the scene titled \\"Le Voyage dans l'√©space\\" (\\"The Space Trip\\"), showed the Good Genie traveling from the sky to the Earth in a celestial taxicab (and, on a more practical level, filled the time needed for an elaborate scene change going on just behind the screen). The other filmed sequence was \\"Le Cyclone\\" (\\"The Cyclone\\"). M√©li√®s also contributed material to the script of the production, which was a marked success, running for some five hundred performances. Contemporary critics singled out M√©li√®s's filmed contributions, and their integration into the stage spectacular, for particular praise. Production After working on Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable, M√©li√®s opted to build the filmed sequence \\"Le Voyage dans l'√©space\\" into a freestanding film. The new material was made at least six months after the original filmed sequences, with different actors, including M√©li√®s himself as Mephistopheles. Though some elements of the film are derived from the stage play, M√©li√®s devised a new plot, and modified the wording of the French title from Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable to Les Quat'Cents Farces du diable to avoid questions of copyright. (M√©li√®s eventually reused the other filmed sequence from the play, \\"Le Cyclone\\", as a scene in his later film Robert Macaire and Bertrand.)Malth√™te & Mannoni, p. 209. The Merry Frolics of Satan is strongly influenced by the legend of Faust, but maintains the modernized comic tone of the f√©eries. It involves numerous recurring themes in M√©li√®s's work, such as a pact with the Devil, a celestial voyage, and a final triumphant scene in Hell; indeed, the end of the film strongly resembles M√©li√®s's earlier The Damnation of Faust, complete with its detailed scenery and bat-winged demons. The farcically choreographed kitchen scene, the hectic pacing of which recalls M√©li√®s's The Cook in Trouble (1904), faithfully reproduces the set and stage machinery that had been traditionally used for the equivalent scene in Les Pilules du diable ever since 1839. The film was made primarily in M√©li√®s's studio, with the outdoor scenes in the Italian village filmed just outside it, in the garden of the M√©li√®s family property in Montreuil-sous-Bois. The many special effects in the film were created using substitution splices, multiple exposures, and especially a large amount of stage machinery, such as trapdoors, openings in the scenery, rolling backdrops, pyrotechnics, and a model volcano M√©li√®s had previously used in his film The Eruption of Mount Pelee (1902).  Release  The Merry Frolics of Satan was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 849‚Äì870 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a grande pi√®ce fantastique en 35 tableaux. In an advertisement, M√©li√®s emphasized the film's creative unity by pointing out that he was personally responsible for the scenario, effects, and production design, in marked contrast to the impersonal mass production process already in use at the rival studio Path√©. In his dedication to the individual process, M√©li√®s would continue to stand in sharp contrast with the larger studios in the ensuing years. Prints of the film survive, and a restoration by the film preservationist David Shepard, incorporating fragments colored by hand, was released to home video in 2008.

It is a form of andon - systems in manufacturing which identify errors as they happen. General Stack lights are used in similar applications as beacon lights/strobes, however the information they typically display encompasses more machine/process conditions. Stack lights typically use incandescent, LED or xenon-type strobes as their illumination source. Stack lights are generally columnar structures in a variety of shapes, placing colour-coded indicator segments on top of one another in a \\"stacked\\" orientation. A stack light will typically have up to 5 differently coloured segments to indicate various conditions on the machine or process. Segments in any combination of (typically) red, yellow, green, blue or clear white are actuated independently and are either off, solid-on (continuous) or flashing. Stack lights are passive devices that may be controlled directly by programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems, PC control systems or hardwired to machine controls such as timers, sensors and latching relays. Discrete signals activate illuminated segments at common industrial control voltages (including 12Vdc, 24Vac/dc, 115Vac, 230Vac). Some units support fieldbus networked control through popular industrial networks such as Modbus, DeviceNet, Profibus, CAN-Open or ASi. Flashing control may be provided by the stack light's internal circuitry or externally controlled with timers or logic controllers. Stack lights are available for all types of industrial environments including washdown (IP65) and explosion proof. Function Various size stack lights Stack lights are used in a variety of machines and process environments; specific colour-coding is assigned by the system designer. Commonly used colour codes for machine state conditions include: * RED: Failure conditions such as an emergency stop or machine fault * YELLOW: Warnings such as over-temperature or over-pressure conditions * GREEN: Normal machine or process operation * BLUE: External help request, where an operator might be requesting raw materials, scheduling or maintenance personnel assistance * WHITE: User-defined conditions to a specific machine, often related to productivity monitoring * Optionally an audible alarm buzzer, typically in the range of 70‚Äì105dB, may be added to alert machine operators to high priority conditions. IEC60073 addresses machine state colour-coding & acoustic alerting, which can be applied to devices including panel pilot lights & stack lights. Machine operator intervention is typically required in red and yellow machine states, as these are normally errors or warnings. Manual intervention is possibly necessary in blue and white conditions. Applications Common applications include, but are not limited to: * Productivity monitoring (often rate-based machine output management with parts-per-hour displays). Uptime & downtime monitoring (overall equipment effectiveness) is a very common use for these devices., INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS, ENGINEERING & DEVELOPMENT Issue 1, Volume 3, 2009. * Warning indication and machine fault management * Lean manufacturing - 5S Initiatives, Why a Visual Factory?, Visual Controls: Applying Visual Management to the Factory, by Ortiz & Park * In conjunction with SCADA supervisory control systems and user interface/HMIs: SCADA/HMIs provide more specific machine/process status data; stack lights complement them by providing visual/audible feedback away from the machine operator console. * Assembly station workcells * Maintenance call stations * CNC machining equipment and process monitoring and feedback * Broadcast studios (commonly used in broadcast radio studios) to display status of things such as a studio on air, live microphones, phone calls and even as a doorbell in an environment where silent indication is critical.

Aoki was the founding editor of the Journal of the Japanese and International Economies.https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-the-japanese-and- international-economies/ Besides authoring five books, Aoki was active in organizing international research projects on various institutional topics and has edited more than ten books for institutions such as the World Bank and the International Economic Association, to which more than 200 scholars from more than 20 countries contributed. Aoki was President of the Japanese Economic Association from 1995 to 1996, and President of the International Economic Association from 2008 to 2011.The Nikkei Weekly, \\"Masahiko Aoki to lead world economics association,\\" October 31, 2005. He was also a Fellow of the Econometric Society. Aoki served as President of the Japanese Government's Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI),The Nikkei Weekly, \\"Professor in U.S. Tapped to Head MITI Institute: Economics Specialist Brings Global View, Activist Attitude,\\" September 1, 1997 where he stressed the necessity of a trans-disciplinary approach to public policy research. Academic Contributions Aoki's major academic contributions to economics and the social sciences in general were in the fields of the comparative institutional analysis, the theory of the firm, and corporate governance. =Comparative institutional analysis= Aoki's research made him a pioneer and leader in comparative institutional analysis. Together with Paul Milgrom, Avner Greif, Yingyi Qian, and Marcel Fafchamp, he created a comparative institutional field in the economics department at Stanford in the early 1990s. They conceptualized institutions as equilibrium phenomena in societal games rather than something given exogenously by factors such as law, policy, and culture. From this perspective he laid analytical foundations for basic concepts in institutional analysis such as institutional complementarities, social embedeness (linked games), and public representations mediating the salient features of the state of play and individual beliefs, and applied them to comparative analysis across countries and regions. Aoki was the first to directly apply institutional analysis to Japan,Vogel, Steven and Nazneen Barma, The Political Economy Reader: Markets as Institutions (Routledge, 2007) arguing in the late 1980s that institutions such as lifetime employment, the main bank system, long-term supplier relations, and government as an interest group mediator were in mutually complementary, game-theoretic equilibria in the context of Japan's institutional evolution.Aoki, Masahiko, Information, Incentives, and Bargaining in the Japanese Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988)The Nikkei Weekly, \\"Interview: Aoki sees 90s as paradigm shift,\\" January 10, 2006. In his 2001 work, Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis, Aoki developed a conceptual and analytical game theoretic approach to comparative studies of institutions.Aoki, Masahiko. Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001)http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/gr3.pdf He used this framework to analyze how institutions evolve, why institutional structures are diverse across economies, and what factors lead to institutional change or rigidity.The Washington Times, \\"Japan's management evolving; Gradual process seen over decade\\" November 26, 2002. =Theory of the firm= The Cooperative Game Theory of the Firm (1984) was a first attempt to synthesize and unify various theories of the firm, such as neoclassical, worker controlled, and stakeholder society views, as special cases of corporate governance with varied weights of bargaining power attributed to the members of the firm.Aoki, Masahiko. The Cooperative Game Theory of the Firm (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984)The Daily Yomiuri, \\"When will a Japanese economist win a Nobel?\\" December 8, 1994. Aoki's interests then moved into comparisons of various internal information structures of the firm (hierarchical, horizontal and modular), and its applications to international varieties of corporate firms across Anglo-American, Japanese, German, Silicon Valley, and Chinese systems, as well as to a comparative assessment of nuclear power disasters (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima).http://siepr.stanford.edu/?q=/system/files/shared/pubs/papers/pdf/11-001_Paper_Aoki.pdf These two viewpoints on corporate firms: a game-theoretic approach to corporate governance and information systemic approach to the internal structure of corporate firms are synthesized in Aoki's 2008 Clarendon Lectures, Corporations in Evolving Diversity.Aoki, Masahiko. Corporations in Evolving Diversity: Cognition, Governance, and Institutions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) Relying on a recent development of potential game theory, he also showed that sufficient and necessary conditions for corporate stakeholders with different payoff functions to behave as if they have a common objective is that they share a common distributive value (technically represented as Shapley value). This insight places the economic theory of the firm in a broader frame of institutional analysis. Death Aoki died on July 15, 2015, at the age of 77. A Memorial Conference celebrating his life and work was held at Stanford University on December 4, 2015 and included addresses by Kenneth Arrow, Francis Fukuyama, Koichi Hamada, and Dale Jorgenson.
