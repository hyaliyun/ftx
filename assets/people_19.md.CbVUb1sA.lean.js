It contains a single species, Medusaceratops lokii.Ryan, Michael J.; Russell, Anthony P., and Hartman, Scott. (2010). \\"A New Chasmosaurine Ceratopsid from the Judith River Formation, Montana\\", In: Michael J. Ryan, Brenda J. Chinnery-Allgeier, and David A. Eberth (eds), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium, Indiana University Press, 656 pp. . Discovery Side view of skeleton The known material of Medusaceratops came from a bonebed in the badlands on the west side of Kennedy Coulee adjacent to the Milk River, in the Milk River Natural Area, near Havre, Hill County of Montana. The material was first reported by Sweeney and Boyden (1993), who considered it to represent the southernmost occurrence of Styracosaurus albertensis, based on misidentified frill spikes. Trexler and Sweeney (1995) reinterpreted the spikes as eye-socket horncores and noted their similarity to those of the nomen dubium Ceratops montanus from a nearby area, however, could not refer the bonebed material to any valid existing taxon. The bonebed, known as the Mansfield Bonebed honoring its landowner, is located on private land and historically has been excavated by several commercial companies. The type material of Medusaceratops and other specimens were excavated more recently and have been purchased by the Wyoming Dinosaur Center from Canada Fossils, Ltd., of Calgary, Alberta. Additional material from the same excavation was purchased and accessioned by the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Canada Fossils, Ltd., also assembled two composite skeletons using the Mansfield Bonebed material which are in the collections of the Wyoming Dinosaur Center and the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, however neither of the casts has an exact reconstruction of Medusaceratops as it was later described. The name Medusaceratops was coined by Canadian paleontologist Michael J. Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in 2003 in a dissertation. Its fossils were subsequently confused with those of Albertaceratops, another centrosaurine ceratopsian from Alberta which had been described by Ryan in 2007. Later, Ryan realized that the Mansfield Bonebed fossils did not belong to Albertaceratops. Medusaceratops was formally described and name by Michael J. Ryan, Anthony P. Russell and Scott Hartman in 2010 and the type species is Medusaceratops lokii. The generic name refers to Medusa, a monster from Greek mythology whose \\"hair\\" consists of snakes and its gaze could turn men to stone, alluding to a unique trait of this genus - the large, thick snake-like spikes that extend to the sides of the frill, in combination with Latinized Greek ceratops, meaning \\"horned-face\\", which is a common suffix for ceratopsian genera names. The specific name lokii honors Loki, a troublemaking god in the Norse mythology, in reference to the years confusion that surrounded the taxonomic designations of the Mansfield Bonebed material before it was given its own name. The Mansfield Bonebed material was collected from the upper part of the Judith River Formation, in a region where it is lithologically equivalent to the Oldman Formation of Canada. The bonebed is located at approximately the same level as the holotype of Albertaceratops, dating to 77.5 million years ago, to the middle Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Thus, Medusaceratops was considered to represent the oldest known chasmosaurine, until the naming of Judiceratops by Longrich (2013), also from the Judith River Formation, but from an area equivalent to the lower Oldman Formation or upper Foremost Formation. However, Ryan had already indicated that part of the Mansfield material represented not a chasmosaurine, but a centrosaurine. Chiba et al. in 2017 described new material of Medusaceratops from the Mansfield Bonebed, found in 2011 and 2012 by David Trexler, indicating the presence of traits that were characteristic of Centrosaurinae in the skeleton of M. lokii. They concluded that all the material could be referred to a single species. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors indicated that Medusaceratops was not a member of Chasmosaurinae after all, but rather an early centrosaurine ceratopsid that was more closely related to Centrosaurini and Pachyrhinosaurini than Nasutoceratopsini. Description Restoration Two partial parietals (frills) that are housed at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center were chosen as the type material of Medusaceratops, including the holotype WDC DJR 001 and the paratype WDC DJR 002\\\\. Although all the chasmosaurine material from the Mansfield Bonebed was thought to be referable to Medusaceratops, which totals at several hundred individual elements, upon its original description only these two partial frills have been scientifically described while the rest of the material was being reexamined. Many of the other elements are not diagnosable to a genus level and can only be confidently referable to Ceratopsidae. Upon its original description Medusaceratops was thought to represent a chasmosaurine. It was suggested that based on its type material alone, Medusaceratops is unique among Chasmosaurinae in having only three epiparietals (frill spikes) on each side of the frill. The first frill spike pair is large and the second is smaller, and both are uniquely widened at base, pachyostotic, curve down the sides of the frill, and are depressed down the front of the frill. The third frill spike pair is small and triangular, unmodified in comparison to early chasmosaurines, but similarly depressed, and borders the squamosal bone. The highly broadened and curved first frill spike pair of Medusaceratops closely resembles the third pair of the frill ornamentation of Albertaceratops, however Medusaceratops was thought to differ (like all chasmosaurines) in lacking tab-shaped, frequently overlapping fourth to seventh pairs of the frill ornamentation of centrosaurines. This was challenged in 2018, by the description of additional Mansfield Bonebed material assignable to Medusaceratops. It became apparent that the 1-3 frill spikes mentioned above are in fact spikes 2-4. The first epiparietal is small and variably procurving and thus was misinterpreted before. At least one more epiparietal pair was also identified (after the fourth), resulting in a total of at least 5 pairs, consistent with centrosaurines like Albertaceratops and Wendiceratops, but not with chasmosaurines. The midline ramus of Medusaceratops, a bone separating the two sides of the frill, was also among the newly described material. It is broad, resulting in rounder and smaller frill fenestrae (holes) like in other centrosaurines. Thus, the new study reassigned Medusaceratops to Centrosaurinae, among which it is most similar to Albertaceratops and Wendiceratops. Classification Reconstruction of parietals of various centrosaurines, including Wendiceratops (A) showing 5 epiparietal pairs and broad midline ramus. Medusaceratops itself is marked by letter (F). Among valid ceratopsids from the Judith River Formation, Medusaceratops can be directly distinguished from centrosaurine Avaceratops, and chasmosaurines Judiceratops and Spiclypeus based on its unique frill ornamentation. It differs from chasmosaurine Mercuriceratops based on its less unique squamosal bone, as evident from newly described squamosal bones of Medusaceratops. All material previously assigned to the centrosaurine Albertaceratops from the formation is now assigned to Medusaceratops or considered too fragmentary. The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba et al.

Youth and education Thomas Frederick Price was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, the eighth child of Alfred and Clarissa Bond Price. His parents were converts to the Catholic faith, and he was raised as a devout Catholic in the midst of Southern apathy toward Catholicism. As a youth, Price was deeply influenced by the priests of his parish (St. Thomas, Wilmington, North Carolina). One cleric who figured prominently in his early life was James Gibbons, newly appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of North Carolina. Gibbons established his headquarters at St. Thomas Church; Price often served Mass for Gibbons and accompanied him on official trips throughout the Vicariate. With his religious background (especially the deep devotion of his mother to the Blessed Virgin Mary), Price soon felt an attraction to the priesthood. He confided his interest to the parish priest, the Rev. Mark Gross, and arrangements were made for him to enter St. Charles College at Catonsville, Maryland, in August 1876. En route to the seminary by ship, Price escaped death in the shipwreck of the Rebecca Clyde. Price attributed his survival to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the accident, he returned home until January 1877. Price attended St. Charles College from January 1877 until his commencement on June 28, 1881. In September 1881, he entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 20, 1886, by Gibbon's successor, Henry P. Northrop, at the pro-cathedral in Wilmington, North Carolina. (Both of Price's parents had died before his ordination.) Price was the first native North Carolinian to be ordained to the priesthood, and he was assigned to missionary work in the eastern section of his home state. Early priesthood Within the first year of his ordination, Price was appointed pastor of the few Catholics in and around the towns of Asheville and New Bern. He later obtained permission from Leo Haid, O.S.B., the current Vicar Apostolic, to begin a statewide evangelization program. His methods were influenced by Fr. Walter Elliott, a famous Paulist preacher. One of Price's tools for evangelization was the publication of the magazine Truth, which he began to edit and publish in April 1897. A second tool was the establishment of Nazareth Orphanage in 1898. Price's plan was first to help the underprivileged of an area and thereby win the favor of the general population, who would then be more inclined to listen to the message of the missioner. Following the success of the Nazareth Orphanage, Price organized summer catechizing teams of seminarians. Finally, in 1902, Price opened a missionary training house at Nazareth. It was a preparatory seminary whose sole purpose was the education and formation of missioners for the home missions. It was called Regina Apostolorum. Price directed the Regina Apostolorum and acted as its primary teacher and spiritual director. Plans for a foreign mission seminary As time went on, Price began to emphasize more and more often, in the pages of Truth, the need of a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign missions. At the same time, Rev. James Anthony Walsh, of Boston, was developing the same idea in the pages of The Field Afar. At the Eucharistic Congress in Montreal in 1910, the two priests met and began to formulate plans for the establishment of a seminary for foreign missioners. With the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 tto receive final approval from Pope Pius X for their project. After meeting with the Pope, Price traveled to Lourdes for the first time. During his stay at Lourdes, Price had a spiritual experience that he refers to in his personal diary: he maintained a special devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes and to St. Bernadette Soubirous until his death. Returning to the United States, Price and Walsh began the plans for the establishment of the new seminary and the foreign mission society. After a brief stay at Hawthorne, New York, property was purchased at Ossining, New York, for the site of the new foundation, the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (popularly known as Maryknoll). =Foreign missions begin= Father Thomas F. Price, co-founder of the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, center, was pictured in a 1918 photo in China. Price made a countrywide tour of America to gain support for the new endeavor. By 1918, three young priests (James Edward Walsh, Francis Xavier Ford, and Bernard F. Meyer) were ready for the foreign missions in China. On September 7, Price went with them as superior to the new mission. From the time of the foundation of Maryknoll, Price had understood that Walsh was the one capable of administering and directing the seminary itself. Price himself had always hoped to be chosen as one of Maryknoll's first missioners, and his dream was realized. This group of first four American missioners in China arrived in Hong Kong in October 1918. They then settled down in Yeungkong (now called Yangjiang) on the South China Coast. Because of his age and its complexity, Price had great difficulty learning the Chinese language Price also suffered from physical ailments. Towards the latter part of 1919, Price became seriously ill. As there were no adequate medical facilities in that area, he was brought to Hong Kong for hospitalization. After a trying trip, Price arrived in the British Colony and was immediately taken to St. Paul's Hospital in Causeway Bay, an institution conducted by the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres. The long and arduous journey from Yeungkong to Hong Kong by primitive means of travel aggravated Price‚Äôs advanced and serious case of appendicitis. He entered the Hospital on 19 August 1919 and was operated on 8 September 1919. However, it was too late and on 12 September, the Feast of the Holy Name of Mary, he died as a result of a burst appendix. His body was buried in the priests‚Äô plot in St. Michael‚Äôs Cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. The date of his death was rather significant, as he had great devotion to Our Lady. He was only 59. A solemn requiem Mass was celebrated on 18 September 1919 at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral for the happy repose of his priestly soul. At this ceremony, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, Fr Pozzoni, gave the last absolution and a large concourse of priests and Sisters attended In 1923, a French missioner returned to France with Price's heart and gave it to St. Bernadette's religious order, the Sisters of Charity of Nevers. It was placed in a niche in the wall near the saint's body in the Motherhouse of the Sisters of Nevers. It was Price‚Äôs own request for he had a very great devotion to Sister Bernadette. Price's body was exhumed in 1936 and transferred to Maryknoll Cemetery in Ossining, New York. In 1955, his remains, together with those of Bishop James A. Walsh, were finally interred in the crypt below the Maryknoll Seminary Chapel. Writings * Bernadette of Lourdes (2013) * The Lily of Mary (2013) References  Bibliography  * John T.

The Africa Mercy served in Freetown, Sierra Leone for 10 months for its 2011 Field Service, At the conclusion of each Field Service, the Africa Mercy goes in to dry dock, where it is resupplied and receives any needed repairs or upgrades before heading to its next port of call. In December 2011/January 2012 the maintenance period was spent in Ghana. Africa Mercy was operating in Lom√©, Togo from January to June 2012, then in Conakry, Guinea from August 2012 to June 2013. The Africa Mercy was docked in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo, from August 2013 to June 2014. The Africa Mercy was docked in Toamasina, Madagascar from October 2014 until June 2015. The vessel returned to Madagascar in October 2015 was docked there until June 2016. The Africa Mercy was in Cotonou, Benin from August 2016 through June 2017. The Africa Mercy was docked in Douala, Cameroon, from August 2017 through June 2018. The Africa Mercy was docked in Conakry, Guinea from August 2018 through June 2019.

In 1945, Orr was among the U.S. Army Intelligence officials who investigated this technology, which was originally developed in Germany during the 1930s. According to one story, in 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to record a message to the German people, which he did using captured German tape. However, the tape had not been completely erased, and Hitler's voice, so the story goes, could be heard intermittently along with that of Eisenhower. Eisenhower ordered that no more captured tape could be used, and ordered Major John Herbert Orr to use captured German scientists to set up an American tape manufacturing facility. Paper tape was the medium in use at the time, but the German engineers had been experimenting with a plastic based tape; they provided Major Orr with the data on this and it became the basis of the modern audio and video recording industry. When the German engineers gave Orr their studies on plastic tape, the only place in Europe manufacturing the material was a factory making ladies imitation leather purses. Orr's early knowledge allowed him to establish Orradio in 1949. When, after some uncertainty, tape became the standard medium for magnetic recorders, and as other uses such as data storage and videotape appeared, Orradio's sales expanded rapidly in the late 1950s. Orradio produced the first commercially available audio tape, video tape, and computer tape in the world. The company was purchased by a larger competitor, the Ampex Corporation, in 1959 when Ampex decided it was cheaper to own the plant than to keep buying all their tape. Ampex spun off its magnetic tape division in 1995 as Quantegy and merged with magnetic tape division of 3M a year later. Orr then founded OrrTronics, which developed the lubricated tape used in closed loop tape systems, also called endless tape cartridge. The system, called the \\"Orrtronic Tapette\\", was produced in versions for home, commercial, and automotive use, and was offered as a prize on television game shows. Evolving from a single track mono design (which stayed in production as the radio station \\"cart\\") through two-track mono and stereo versions. OrrTronics was then sold to Delco Battery and Orr formed Orrox Corporation, which specialized in hard disc drive controllers, refurbishing of Quadruplex videotape recorder heads, and computerized video tape editing systems for TV broadcasters and post-production houses. The latter product, CMX Systems, was for many years the preferred editing system for 80% of all television programming originating on videotape. Orr retired from Orrox in 1976 and founded Orr Proprietorship, which transcribed recorded media, from early cylinder recordings to 1960s tape recordings, onto modern tape for preservation. Orr died of a heart attack in 1984 while on a Sunday afternoon drive with his sister. In 2005, a segment in the PBS series History Detectives (Car Tape Deck, Season 3, Episode 6) featured Orr and his contribution to the early magnetic tape industry.

The Danish name for the orchestra indicates its original function as an ensemble geared to supplying the music for court events. The orchestra traces its origins back to 1448 and the Trumpet Corps at the royal court of King Christian I, and thus has claims to be the oldest orchestra in the world. Over the years, the orchestra moved out of the court and settled down in the pit at the Royal Danish Theatre. Its leaders included Christoph Willibald Gluck, who composed the music for special occasions such as the celebration of the birth, in 1749, of the later King Christian VII, whilst in Denmark. A growing number of engagements saw an increase in the size of the orchestra. When Johan Gottlieb Naumann carried out his reforms in the 1780s, the ensemble numbered 46 members. At this time, the Chorus of the Royal Danish Opera became permanently assigned to the Royal Danish Theatre. F.L.√Ü. Kunzen introduced Mozart into the ensemble's repertoire in the 1790s. The tenure of Johan Svendsen, starting in 1883, began a pronounced period of growth and development for the orchestra, including Svendsen‚Äôs introduction of major symphonic works in a series of concerts by the Royal Danish Orchestra that gradually became a tradition in the world of Danish music, while the major symphonies became the domain of the orchestra.

The Royal Danish Orchestra presently consists of around 100 musicians. The principal venue for the orchestra's traditional symphony concerts is the Copenhagen Opera House where the orchestra also is a pit orchestra for the Royal Danish Opera, as well as holding several annual chamber orchestra concerts in the foyer of the smaller experimental stage Takkelloftet.

It is published by Dale Carnegie and Associates, and given out as a prize in the Dale Carnegie Course. Summary Abraham Lincoln, a farm boy, becomes the President of the United States. He travels miles to borrow books; reading being the dominant passion of his for quarter of a century. He mourns the loss of his first love his whole life. He humors his colleagues in the White House, and lives with the difficulties of the marriage with his second love, while in war with the South. Inspirations and writing process One spring day, Dale Carnegie was breakfasting at a hotel in London. He came across a column in the Morning Post newspaper entitled \\"Men and Memories\\". On that particular morning and for several mornings following, that column was devoted to Abraham Lincoln‚Äîthe personal side of his career. Carnegie read those with profound interest, and surprise. He had always been interested in the United States history. Aroused by the articles in the Morning Post, Carnegie went over to the British Museum Library and read a number of Lincoln books; the more he read, the more fascinated he became. Finally he determined to write a book on Lincoln, himself. Carnegie began the work in Europe, and labored over it for a year there, and then for two years in New York. Finally he tore up all that he had written and tossed it into a waste-basket. He then went to Illinois, to write of Lincoln on the very ground where Lincoln himself had dreamed and toiled. For months he lived among people whose fathers had helped Lincoln survey land, build fences and drive hogs to market. For months he delved among old books, letters, speeches, half-forgotten newspapers and musty court records, trying to understand Lincoln. Carnegie spent one summer in the little town of Petersburg. He went there because it is only a mile away from the restored village of New Salem, where Lincoln spent the happiest and most formative years of his life. The same white oaks under which Lincoln studied, wrestled and made love were still standing. Every morning Carnegie used to take his typewriter and motor up there from Petersburg, and wrote half of the chapters of his book under those trees. He often used to go alone to the woods along the banks of the Sangamon, on summer nights, realizing that on such nights Lincoln and Ann Rutledge, his first love, had walked over this same ground. When Carnegie came to writing the chapter dealing with the death of Rutledge, he drove over the country roads to the quiet, secluded spot where she lay buried. It was abandoned and overgrown, so to get near her grave, he had to mow down weeds, brush and vines. Carnegie also wrote many of the chapters in Springfield. Some in the sitting-room of the old home where Lincoln lived, some at the desk where he composed his first inaugural address, and others above the spot where he came to court and quarrel with Mary Todd Lincoln.  Reception  Dixon Ryan Fox, professor of history in Columbia University, wrote: \\"A fascinating book, as dramatic as a Sabatini novel. It is just in portraiture and wise in emphasis. It is the most vivid volume I have read on Lincoln's whole life.\\" Lowell Thomas wrote: \\"The most amazing story in American history. It is a Lincoln book that perhaps could not have been written until today‚Äîand a book that no man can read without profit. I know of no other short work on Lincoln which presents so much of him and presents it so unforgettably.\\" Homer Croy wrote: \\"It's a wonder! I've always been a Lincoln bug and have read many volumes on him. This comes nearer to making Abraham Lincoln a living, breathing human being than any book that I have ever read. This book takes Lincoln out of the sky, moves him into the house next door and makes a neighbour of him. He's as human as a pair of overalls flapping on the clothes-lines.\\"  Anthropodermic bibliopegy  A portion of the binding in the copy of Dale Carnegie's \\"Lincoln the Unknown\\" that is part of Temple University's Charles L.

The building has been under governmental protection since 1968. Originally operating as a 36-room inn within the multipurpose Palace Rossiya, whose almost 3-year construction and January 1908 opening represented a major investment of the Russian Empire in the Kingdom of Serbia economy, Hotel Moskva eventually expanded its facilities to take up the entire palace.  Location  Hotel Moskva is located on the Terazije square in Belgrade's downtown core, administratively part of the Stari Grad municipality. It lies at the intersection of three streets: Terazije, Prizrenska, and Balkanska. Its location on top of Terazijska Terasa provides a wonderful skyline view of Novi Beograd, across the Sava river. The entire area of Terazije is abundant in underground streams, causing major problems for large scale construction projects in the area, including the hotel, nearby Palace Albanija, and the underground passages below Terazije. Today, there are still 11 active water springs underneath Hotel Moskva.  History  Hotel Moskva In the late 1890s, during the Obrenoviƒá royal house rule ‚Äî specifically King Alexander I ‚Äî in the Kingdom of Serbia, the empty plot of land at Terazije where Hotel Moskva is located today, was sold cheaply by the Belgrade municipal authorities to local merchant Bo≈°ko Tadiƒá. By the early 1900s, together with his wife Stana, Tadiƒá completed a simple one-story family house on the plot. At the time, the Terazije plateau around the house was lined with large chestnut trees that provided nice shade over a small open market where market sellers from Zemun, across the Sava river in neighbouring Austria-Hungary, as well as peasants from the Belgrade outskirts came to sell their produce. In essence, the open market was an upper town outpost of the larger Zeleni Venac open market located several hundred meters down nearby Prizrenska Street. = Velika Srbija inn = After Tadiƒá's death, his wife Stana inherited the property. Known around town as Stana Bo≈°kova (Bo≈°ko's Stana), she immediately sold the property to the Arilje-born Marjanoviƒá brothers, Bogosav and Milo≈°, well-known restaurateurs who had already owned and managed several kafanas throughout Belgrade. Additionally, Bogosav Marjanoviƒá was revered as a veteran of the Herzegovina Uprising, which he voluntarily joined in 1875, fighting under the command of Golub Babiƒá. The brothers quickly turned the family house into an inn, eventually naming it Velika Srbija ‚Äî reportedly after the eponymous informal co-operative made up of regular guests from the Marjanoviƒás' other kafanas. Branislav Nu≈°iƒá, famous writer and a regular of Belgrade kafanas, wrote that the name had actually been suggested by another kafana regular Stanislav Kaƒáanski because it was the gathering spot for \\"Serbian gentlemen to drink bermet and feed on patriotism\\". Yet another regular at the Velika Srbija inn's kafana was Stevan Sremac, famous writer who reportedly spent many late nights there and even modified his work schedule at his professorial job in one of Belgrade's gymnasiums so that he can sleep late in the morning. By 1902, the Marjanoviƒás sold the inn to merchants Mitar Vrankoviƒá and Nikola Vuƒçkoviƒá who in 1904 flipped it to Svetozar Vukadinoviƒá, former director of the Serbian Shipbuilding Company who had just returned to Serbia following an exile of sorts. Born in 1860 in Novi Sad, Austria-Hungary in a staunchly nationalist Serb household of priest Jevtimije \\"Jevta\\" Vukadinoviƒá, young Svetozar moved across the border into Serbia where he became an administrator in various shipbuilding companies before being forced into exile due to running afoul of King Milan I Obrenoviƒá's pro-Austrian economic policies. During his exile Vukadinoviƒá spent time in Russia, as well as in Austria- Hungary just across the border in Novi Sad and Zemun, waiting for the right moment to return to Serbia. That moment eventually came following the June 1903 Obrenoviƒá overthrow. Though he bought the centrally located Velika Srbija, ambitious Vukadinoviƒá had no interest in running an inn. Instead, he traveled back to Imperial Russia looking to parlay his newly acquired Belgrade property into a larger business venture. Calling on his Russian connections, Vukadinoviƒá managed to get some interest from Roman Ivanovich Poitzl of the Rossiya insurance company about enabling the company to enter the Serbian market via opening a branch in Serbia. They additionally agreed an ambitious project of building a luxurious multipurpose palace in place of Vukadinoviƒá's inn that would serve as the branch headquarters. In 1905 they requested architectural design proposals for a future palace to be submitted to the panel consisting of two architects from Saint Petersburg, famous Vienna architect Otto Wagner, and Belgrade architects Andra Stevanoviƒá and Nikola Nestoroviƒá. Backed by the Russian architects and Otto Wagner, the design by the Zagreb-based architect Viktor Kovaƒçiƒá (1874‚Äì1924) got selected, with the Belgrade-based architect 's (1857-1917) design supported by Stevanoviƒá and Nestoroviƒá coming in second. Still, the Rossiya's directorate eventually picked Ilkiƒá, bringing him over to Saint Petersburg in order to continue working on the design along with Russian architects. How much of Ilkiƒá's original design was changed in Saint Petersburg is unclear, but according to art historian Draginja Maskareli, the fact that the original construction plans have been signed by Rossiya's chief architect Pawel Karlovich Bergstresser (1851-1920), as well as the fact that Moskva's final facade contains elements of Saint Petersburg secession, it is reasonable to assume that there were changes. = Construction of the Rossiya Palace = The construction began in March 1905. Sheer size of the project attracted many Belgraders who gathered daily around the construction site, watching the excavation and laying of the foundation. Right away, the project ran into unexpected problems when it was discovered that the soil under the Velika Srbija inn is full of hardened loam as well as underground springs and subterranean streams, creating additional budgetary needs. Eighty-two wooden beams, 5m in length and 30 cm thick, were placed in the palace's foundation followed by 30 wagons of boiling iron in 9-meter long rods, and 10 wagons of hard Ripanj stone. A 2.2m thick concrete panel was then placed over the foundation. The brick-laying hadn't started until spring 1906. The construction work was performed by the civil engineer Karlo Knol and the bricklayers from Crna Trava while the supervising engineer was the project design architect Ilkiƒá himself. Reinforced concrete part of the job was managed by architect Matija ≈†najder. The surface of the outer walls from the second floor to the roof was lined with yellowish tiles decorated with green- coloured ornaments. The ceramic lining was brought in from the Zsolnay factory in P√©cs, Austria-Hungary that reportedly to this day keeps the casts used to mold it. The upper part of the hotel's fa√ßade was laid with a maiolica decorative relief titled 'Glorification of Russia', featuring an image of Roman god Neptune, symbolizing Imperial Russia's yearning for maritime dominance.Majstorice i stari kalupi;Politika, 31 January 2011 Hotel Moskva by night (2017) Ilkiƒá's design employed a Secessionist style with skillfully incorporated ancient Greek elements, quite daring for that time, giving Belgrade a modern face during the transformation it was undergoing at the turn of the century. The most impressive feature, even at first glance, is the smooth and shiny fa√ßade, made of ceramic tiles. Upon construction, Hotel Moskva inside the Palace Rossiya had only 36 hotel rooms.–•–æ—Ç–µ–ª –Ω–∞ –¢–µ—Ä–∞–∑–∏—ò–∞–º–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏–æ –¥–µ–≤–µ—Ç –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞;Politika, 22 January 2008 = Grand opening = The Rossiya palace (in Serbian: Palata Rosija) was finally opened on Tuesday, 14 January 1908 as the biggest privately owned building in Serbia at the time. Its importance to the country was evidenced in the fact that it was personally opened by King Peter I of Serbia.Politika daily, January 22, 2008, p. 23 Another part of the opening ceremony was held three days later on Friday, the 17th of January with the King's Guard, the Royal Serbian Army's most elite unit, staging a concert. In addition to Hotel Moskva, the palace housed a kafana, an exclusive restaurant serving specialties from the French and Serbian cuisines, numerous apartments for rent, and the Rossiya insurance company's Belgrade branch headed by Svetozar Vukadinoviƒá. The insurance company branch consisted of administrative offices on the first floor (one floor above ground) while the teller windows and offices were on the ground floor. Surrounded by structures of one or two stories, the sheer size of Palata Rosija dominated the skyline of Belgrade, a city of some 70,000 inhabitants at the time. As evidenced by the Russian diplomat 's observations in his book Balkan Memories,–ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–µ —É—Å–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–µ looking at the city from across the river Sava in the late 1900s and early 1910s, three structures clearly grabbed immediate attention ‚Äî the Saborna church with its bell tower, the Royal palace with its three domes, and now also the Rossiya palace.Kako je ‚ÄûVelika Srbija‚Äù postala ‚ÄûMoskva‚Äù;Politika, 30 November 2009 Politika, the Serbian newspaper of record, pronounced Palata Rosija \\"the most expensive and the most beautiful Russian house in the Balkans\\". The palace was also a significant political statement, providing yet another example of King Peter I Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá's and prime minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá's turning of Serbia's foreign and economic policies towards the Russian Empire and away from Austria- Hungary. Its opening took place in the middle of the so-called Pig War, a bitter economic showdown initiated by the Austro-Hungarian imposition of a customs blockade on the import of Serbian pork, Serbia's chief export at the time. Austria-Hungary decided to punish Serbia for steadily moving out of Austria-Hungary's geopolitical sphere of influence ever since the 1903 May Overthrow when the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒás re-took the Serbian throne from the toppled ruling house, the Obrenoviƒás, who had been Austrian clients for decades prior. Right away, the palace's tenants began moving in ‚Äî on 31 January 1908, the Russo-Serbian Club settled into its new offices. They were followed by Novo vreme, a newspaper published by Vladislav \\"Vlajko\\" Saviƒá, taking its spot at the palace's fourth floor. Later that year, the newly founded Narodna Odbrana housed its Belgrade branch in the Rossiya palace. In 1909, Rossiya insurance company decided to lease out Hotel Moskva and the kafana inside the Rossiya palace to Mehansko-kafanska zadruga, a local hospitality co-operative headed by Danilo Gute≈°a who put Luka ƒÜeloviƒá in charge of running the hotel's and kafana's day-to-day operations. Being a Narodna Odbrana member as well as a Novo vreme correspondent, famous Serbian poet Jovan Duƒçiƒá spent a lot of time at the Rossiya palace. The 18 December 1909 Novo vreme issue wrote of an incident in Hotel Moskva's lobby that saw Duƒçiƒá punch , a professor at one of Belgrade gymanasiums. Unsurprisingly, the newspaper's piece was sympathetic to their correspondent, stating that his punch occurred as a consequence of Odaviƒá's repeatedly confrontational and aggressive behaviour. On 23 February 1910, Serbian Olympic Club (OKS) was founded in the fourth floor offices of Novo vreme at the Rossiya palace with the newspaper's publisher Vlajko Saviƒá and the Serbian Army captain Svetomir ƒêukiƒá leading the new committee.Vek olimpizma u Srbiji;RTS, 25 July 2012 A memorial plaque at the entrance into the hotel commemorates the event. Similarly, the Journalists' club and the Writers' club both moved into the palace. = Interbellum (Kingdom of Yugoslavia period) = Hotel Moskva and wider Terazije area, early 1920s The hotel had a role in the post-World War I Serbian literary scene. Arriving in 1919 to a war-ravaged city that still didn't have a fully restored electrical grid and water supply, novelist Milo≈° Crnjanski described Belgrade as being \\"wrecked and ugly ‚Äî full of holes, ruins, weeds, uncertainty, sensational political events, and returning writers from all corners of the world\\". Crnjanski proceeded to establish Grupa umetnika, a small but enthusiastic collective of writers, painters, and musicians eager to provide the city with a new beginning in art and culture.Belgrade: A Cultural History;David Norris They did not form a coherent school or movement, but their meetings, discussions, and polemics over the nature of art provided an engaging and stimulating atmosphere for a younger generation of Modernist writers amidst the Belgrade ruins. In addition to Crnjanski, the group that united pre-war and post-war generations featured Sima Panduroviƒá, Rastko Petroviƒá, Stanislav Vinaver, Ivo Andriƒá, Momƒçilo Nastasijeviƒá, Stanislav Krakov, Branko Lazareviƒá, etc. They met in Hotel Moskva's kafana, because, according to Crnjanski, it was the only place with light. With the Bolshevik-led October Revolution taking place, putting an end to the Russian Empire and eventually giving birth to Soviet Union, the relations between the newly established communist state and the also newly founded Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes led by the same royal house, the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒás, rapidly cooled. With the disappearance of the Russian Empire, Rossiya insurance company went away too. Hotel Moskva was thus taken over by Po≈°tanska ≈°tedionica (Postal Savings Bank), a recently established local financial institution. On 1 October 1923, Po≈°tanska ≈°tedionica bank opened its very first counter window at the palace. In 1938 the palace was taken over by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. In 1937, a submission by Romanian architects won the city-announced competition on the re-arrangement of the entire Belgrade downtown core from the Theatre Square to Terazije. The plan envisioned demolition of both Hotel Balkan and Hotel Moskva as well as the formation of a monumental park that would extend below the hotel, down the Terazije Terrace. However, two years later in 1939, the newly- passed Belgrade general urbanistic plan restored the 1923 project by architect Nikola Dobroviƒá who also envisioned a park, but without demolishing the hotels. Leon Trotsky stayed at the hotel while the French linguist and historian wrote a poem about the hotel, \\"Moskva, the giant house\\". The 1938 French film Ultimatum ‚Äî directed by Robert Wiene and Robert Siodmak, and starring Dita Parlo and Erich von Stroheim ‚Äî was filmed in the hotel. = World War II: Gestapo HQ = In spring 1941, with Kingdom of Yugoslavia invaded and quickly conquered by Nazi Germany before getting carved up into several Nazi client states, Gestapo moved into Hotel Moskva, transforming it into its headquarters. Not liking its references to Russia, they also renamed it Hotel Velika Srbija, after the original inn. All throughout World War II, the headquarters had their own power generators and even water sources independent of the city supply in addition to elevators and wide basement facilities. The hotel was one of the last Belgrade buildings to be liberated in October 1944 when the Soviet Red Army stormed the occupied city. During the Nazi German occupation, the hotel's original master's paintings, silverware and gold-plated utensils were looted and taken away. = Nationalization: The communist period = In the post World War II period, the hotel went right back to being the cultural elite's favourite congregation spot. Yugoslav Nobel laureate in literature, Ivo Andriƒá, had his own table at the restaurant. Poet Vasko Popa was a regular visitor who frequented the hotel's cafe for decades on a daily basis ‚Äî his daily ritual consisted of arriving every day at 3:30pm, drinking his coffee and staying until 6pm. With the post-war influx of people from Montenegro into Belgrade, the hotel cafe's summer patio also became a favourite hangout for the Montenegrin newcomers to the city. The perception that being seen drinking coffee while hanging out amongst the cultural elite at Hotel Moskva was an instant seal of approval, endured for decades. In 1974, the hotel restaurant added a poslastiƒçarnica (locally customized version of a cakery or p√¢tisserie) as part of its offering. Among the various cakes introduced on the occasion was Moskva ≈°nit, a fruitcake with almonds, sour cherries, and pineapple, that quickly became popular and remains one of hotel's staples until present day. The original Moskva ≈°nit recipe, that had in the meantime been trademarked, was put together by the restaurant's then pastry chef Anica D≈æepina. As reported in early 2015, every day a piece of Moskva ≈°nit gets ordered by between 200 and 300 patrons of the hotel's restaurant while some one thousand whole cakes get delivered monthly to home addresses. = Re-privatization = In August 2005, the hotel's umbrella legal entity, state-owned Moskva a.d.,Moskva a.d. had its 82.83% purchased by the Belize-based off-shore investment fund Netwest Finance represented by Serbian businessman Mile DragiƒáProdat hotel \\"Moskva\\";Kurir, 16 August 2005 for ‚Ç¨11 million.\\"Moskva\\" kao \\"Ric\\";Veƒçernje novosti, 28 July 2006 Right away on 13 September 2005, the hotel's new owners decided to start trading the hotel's shares on the Belgrade Stock ExchangeAddmision to the Free Market-Hotel Moskva a.d. Beograd as HMSK.HMSK At the July 2006 shareholders meeting, it was agreed to seek out a brand name partnership by hooking up with an established global brand. Specific brands being mentioned were Four Seasons, and one of the Marriott brands such as Ritz-Carlton, however, nothing came of it and Moskva continued as a standalone hotel. Around the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in May 2008, the timetable for Hotel Moskva's renovation, expansion, and possible upgrade to the five star hotel was announced. Expansion plans included building of a garage, congressional hall, and a shopping mall. Throughout 2009 and 2010, four years after its re-privatization, the hotel finally underwent extensive renovation ‚Äî from April until September 2009, the side facing Balkanska Street was refurbished, both internally and externally, with new furniture, wallpaper, drapes, curtains, bathrooms, flooring, and electronic locks. From the fall 2009 until April 2010 the same was done with the side facing Terazije.  Famous guests  Hotel Moskva is a four star hotel. It is the only hotel in Belgrade that has no room or an apartment number 13. It had over 36 million visitors in the past 100 years, including celebrities like Serbian Field-marshals ≈Ωivojin Mi≈°iƒá and Petar Bojoviƒá, inventors Mikhail Kalashnikov, Nikola Tesla, Mihajlo Pupin, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein, chess players Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, athletes Carl Lewis, Jose Mourinho, Vujadin Boskov, Luis Figo, Novak Djokovic, Michael Jordan, Kyrie Irving, Tiger Woods, actors like Robert De Niro, Kirk Douglas, Milla Jovovich, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Julia Roberts, Alain Delon, Tom Hanks, Audrey Hepburn, Pierce Brosnan, producers like Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, Milo≈° Forman, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Emir Kusturica, Jean-Luc Godard, politicians like Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Rajiv Gandhi, Yasser Arafat, Indira Gandhi, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Richard Nixon and others, singers and tenors like Luciano Pavarotti, Yves Montand, Ray Charles, Bob Geldof, Serge Gainsbourg, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, writers like Maxim Gorky, Orson Welles, Rebecca West, Jean-Paul Sartre, Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, Ivo Andriƒá and many others. Glas javnosti The pictures of the famous visitors are in a hotel hallways.  In fiction and popular culture  Hotel Moskva has been depicted or referenced in various works of music, film, and literature. Miroslav Krle≈æa's NIN Prize-winning 1962 novel Zastave features several references to Hotel Moskva. Set in the Balkans during the turbulent 1912‚Äì1922 period, it follows the lives and fates of some 20 characters; each of them of different profession, pedigree, and financial means, but from the milieu of Serbian, Croatian, and Hungarian intelligentsias. At one point, one of the main characters decides to take a peek into Hotel Moskva's kafana where, as he says with contempt, \\"wet tobacco is smoked\\" and \\"Byzantine intrigues are drawn up\\". Klopka, a 2007 neo-noir film set in the post-Milo≈°eviƒá Serbia exploring how far is a financially strapped father willing to go in order to come up with funds for his ill child's surgery, features a key scene in Hotel Moskva's cafe where the mysterious man played by Miki Manojloviƒá makes an offer to the sick child's father played by Neboj≈°a Glogovac of paying for his son's surgery in return for the man carrying out an assassination.

In 2006, she pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement in connection with the misapplication of federal funds provided to MBC. \\"Former Morris Brown College president, financial aid director indicted for fraud\\", December 30, 2004, in Black Issues in Higher Education. Accessed via online archive service January 4, 2007.  Early life  Dolores Cross was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in public housing there. After receiving her Bachelor of Science in Education from Seton Hall University in 1963, Cross obtained her Master of Science in education from Hofstra University and a Ph.D. in higher education from the University of Michigan in 1971. In 2001 Seton Hall awarded her an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters.  Career  Cross is a former professor and university administrator who served as vice chancellor for student affairs at City University of New York and the president of the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation before becoming the first female president of Chicago State University in 1990. Cross moved from the presidency of Chicago State in 1997 to the presidency of the GE Fund, a non-profit wing of General Electric. Shortly after that, she accepted the position as the first female president of Morris Brown College. = Morris Brown College tenure = When Cross arrived at Morris Brown College, it was financially troubled. While she was President, Morris Brown College obtained $3.4 million in federally insured student loans and Pell grants in the names of ineligible students, including some who never attended the college, some who were enrolled part-time and others who had already left. The money was used to pay the school's operating costs. As with all such loans, the responsibility for paying back the loans fell on the students. Due to its ongoing financial issues, the school eventually lost its accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. After the loss of accreditation, MBC students became ineligible for many government grants and loans. The school nearly closed in 2003 as its enrollment dropped.. The school faced foreclosure in 2012, and went through bankruptcy in 2014. In May 2006, Cross pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzlement stemming from her time at the college.Morris Brown College May 1, 2006, Washington Post.Ex-President of Morris Brown College Pleads Guilty to Embezzlement , The Chronicle of Higher Education, May 1, 2006.

In addition, the college‚Äôs financial-aid director at the time the fraud was committed was also sentenced, to five years of probation and 18 months of home confinement. The prosecutors and her lawyers agreed to a plea bargain. The light sentence meted out by the judge was based on her age (70), her medical condition (she suffered from sleep apnea and had a series of transient ischemic attacks or small strokes) and the fact that she did not profit personally from the crime.

It runs , carrying U.S. Highway 61 from New Orleans northwest to Baton Rouge and U.S. Highway 190 from Baton Rouge west over the Mississippi River on the Huey P. Long Bridge. US 190 continues west towards Opelousas on an extension built at roughly the same time. The highway was named \\"Airline\\" because it runs relatively straight on a new alignment, rather than alongside the winding Mississippi River. (Compare with the similar term air-line railroad.) The name later became even more fitting, as both Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport were built along the highway. Airline Highway also runs close to the site of the old Baton Rouge airfield (near the intersection of Airline and Florida Boulevard, now a park and government office complex), which brings it within blocks of the similarly named Airport Avenue and Airway Drive. History The highway's origin is famously identified with Governor Huey P. Long, who advocated for a modern highway system in Louisiana. Though the project was underway when Long took office, most of its initial construction was completed during his administration. The Airline Highway was considered a pet project of Long's as it reduced the length of his journey between the capitol building in Baton Rouge and the bars and establishments in New Orleans, namely The Sazerac Bar in the Roosevelt Hotel. Originally, Airline Highway was a two-lane road that ran from Prairieville to Shrewsbury. The first section, running between Williams Boulevard in Kenner and Shrewsbury Road, opened in June 1927. It was begun by the Jefferson Parish Police Jury as a local road and incorporated into the plan for Airline Highway during construction. The remainder of the highway was built between 1928 and 1933 by the Louisiana Highway Commission with federal aid, as the road would carry US 61 upon completion. The section north of the spillway was officially opened on July 4, 1933, and the section on the south side followed three weeks later. (Various sections had been temporarily opened to traffic beginning in October 1931.) Completion of the bridge over the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway was delayed until 1935, necessitating a detour over the Jefferson Highway (River Road) via temporary gravel roads along the spillway guide levees. The spillway bridge was opened to traffic on September 28, 1935 and dedicated on December 13. At this time, traffic was routed from Prairieville into Baton Rouge over the Jefferson Highway (today's LA 73). On the New Orleans end, travelers had the option to continue on Airline Highway and follow Metairie Road (the original route of Jefferson Highway) into town or transfer to the Jefferson Highway (today's LA 48) at Kenner and follow the direct connection onto South Claiborne Avenue completed in 1928. The first improvements to the Airline Highway began in 1935 and consisted of widening and re-surfacing the Kenner-Shrewsbury link built a decade earlier. The new four-lane section from Williams Boulevard to Haring Road opened in October 1937. The new four- and six-lane section from Haring Road to Labarre Road opened in December 1938. The latter project included a slight re-alignment and extension on the Shrewsbury end. (Present-day Robertson Street is a remnant of the old alignment.) The eight-lane extension into Tulane Avenue (reached by a now-demolished six-lane bridge over the former New Basin Canal) was officially opened on August 26, 1940. Also in 1940, the Old Mississippi River Bridge opened in Baton Rouge. With this occurrence, a 7.9 mile bypass was built around the city that went to the Nesser Overpass, opening to traffic in July 1941‚Äîthis bypass was part of Airline Highway, but it was not connected to the rest of the highway until 1953. A further extension continued west to the Atchafalaya Bridge at Krotz Springs. The remainder of the highway was multilaned in sections during the 1940s and the 1950s. For a short time in that decade, it was the longest toll- free four-lane highway in the nation, as the multilaned portion ran 124 miles from the Atchafalaya River to New Orleans. The spillway bridge carried four very narrow lanes of traffic (often resulting in accidents) until 1984 when a parallel bridge was constructed. The majority of the New Orleans-Baton Rouge section was built parallel to the Louisiana Railway and Navigation Company, which was itself built later than the slightly longer Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. The former Louisiana Railway, now part of the Kansas City Southern Railway, crosses the Huey Long Bridge with the highway and splits to the northwest towards Shreveport; the extension to Opelousas parallels the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway (later part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad). Originally US Highways 65 and 51 were cosigned to Airline (65 the entire length, and 51 from LaPlace to New Orleans). In 1951, Louisiana truncated the route lengths, and the highway, with the exception of a portion in north Baton Rouge, is signed as US 61. In an effort to clean up the highway's notorious history due to the seedy hotels and motels that once lined it, the portion in Jefferson Parish has been renamed Airline Drive. Baton Rouge bypass Sign showing the intersection of U.S. Highway 61 (Airline Highway) at U.S. Highway 51 in LaPlace, Louisiana 1955 Interstate Highway plans, showing the Baton Rouge bypass on the Airline Highway as an urban route (numbered I-410 by 1959) The portion of the Airline Highway north and east of downtown Baton Rouge carries U.S. Highway 61 and U.S. Highway 190 around downtown, and includes several interchanges. The bypass was designated U.S. Highway 61/190 Bypass from 1957 to 1963, after which US 61 and US 190 were moved onto it, and their old routes through downtown became US 61 Business/US 190 Business. The bypass and business routes originally intersected in a traffic circle, which was replaced in 1963 by a cloverleaf interchange. In the original 1955 plan for urban Interstate Highways, numbered by 1959, the Baton Rouge bypass was designated Interstate 410; it would have connected to Interstate 10 on both ends (as I-10 would have used the US 190 corridor immediately west of Baton Rouge, still crossing the Atchafalaya Swamp in its present location). The route was cancelled by the end of the 1960s (and the number was later reused for another Interstate 410).

It is on the north- western coast of Cape York Peninsula. In the , Injinoo had a population of 561 people. History Luthigh (also known as Lotiga, Tepiti and Uradhi, see also Uradhi related languages) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Luthigh people. The traditional language area for Luthigh includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire: Eastern Cape York, Ducie River, Northern Peninsula, New Mapoon, Injinoo, and Cowal Creek. Uradhi (also known as Anggamudi, Ankamuti, Atampaya, Bawtjathi, and Lotiga) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Western Cape York Peninsula. The traditional language region includes north of Mapoon and Duyfken Point and east of the coast strip to the north of Port Musgrave (Angkamuthi country) incorporating the mouth of the Ducie River, the lower reaches of the Dulhunty River and the upper reaches of the Skardon River in the north. Following the displacement of Indigenous people by British settlement, it was also spoken in the Northern Peninsula Area Region including the communities of New Mapoon, Injinoo and Cowal Creek. Injinoo Aboriginal Community was an Aboriginal settlement and later Anglican mission established on Cape York by a community led by a Wuthathi man, Allelic Whitesand. Although self-sufficient, through fishing and gardening, the Community made requests to the then Church of England to establish a mission and school. Queensland government officials allowed the community to function through an elected Council. After the Second World War, which saw a considerable military presence in the area, many Torres Strait Islanders began moving into Injinoo. Settlements were subsequently built at Bamaga, New Mapoon and Umagico to relocate evicted people from this and other areas of the Cape. In 1948 a reserve was created, with control of the area having been taken over by the Queensland Department of Native Affairs. The officialn name of the community was changed from Cowal Creek to Injinoo on 2 September 1989. At the 2006 census, Injinoo had a population of 416.  Facilities  In 2012, the Indigenous Knowledge Centre was opened at Injinoo, operated by the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council. It has produced a video detailing traditional bush foods as part of a children's language workshop.

The state park is bordered on both its north and south sides by Assateague Island National Seashore and is reached via the Verrazano Bridge which carries Maryland Route 611 across Sinepuxent Bay. The park offers wildlife viewing, beach activities, and camping facilities. It is managed by the Maryland Park Service of the larger Maryland Department of Natural Resources with the support of volunteers working under the auspices of the non-profit Friends of Assateague State Park. History State planners suggested establishing a state park on Assateague Island in 1940 and again in 1952. The park was finally created in 1956 when the state Board of Public Works accepted a gift of 540 acres from North Ocean Beach, Incorporated. Funds for further acquisitions were allocated by the General Assembly of Maryland in 1959 and 1962, with funding for facility development allocated in 1965. A tradition of New Year's Day walks in the park began on January 1, 1980, the same year President Jimmy Carter proclaimed \\"Year of the Coast.\\" The walk was started by two women, Ilea Fehrer and Judy Johnson, founder of the Committee to Preserve Assateague Island (now known as the Assateague Coastal Trust), who sought to celebrate the beauty of the island and rally against plans to develop areas around it. It subsequently became an annual tradition, with the 40th iteration taking place in 2020, and became very popular over time, with people driving from various other parts of the state to join in with up to 300 others. The Ilia Fehrer / Judy Johnson Memorial Beach Walk, named after the two women who started it, is now part of Maryland's roster of the nationwide offering of First Day Hikes in state parks. Wildlife Wildlife found in the park's marsh areas include deer, waterfowl, and feral Assateague horses. Activities and amenities Rackliffe House, which overlooks Sinepuxent Bay, is a restored 18th-century coastal plantation building that houses the Coastal Maryland Heritage Center.

The Director of Intelligence supervises the Intelligence Department of HQMC and is responsible for policy, plans, programming, budgets, and staff supervision of Intelligence and supporting activities within the U.S. Marine Corps as well as supervising the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). The Department supports the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) in his role as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), represents the service in Joint and Intelligence Community matters, and exercises supervision over the MCIA. The Department has Service Staff responsibility for Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Advanced Geospatial Intelligence (AGI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Counterintelligence (CI), and ensures there is a single synchronized strategy for the development of the Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Enterprise. The MCIA, located at Hochmuth Hall (see Bruno Hochmuth ), provides tailored intelligence and services to the Marine Corps, other services, and the Intelligence Community based on expeditionary mission profiles in littoral areas. It supports the development of service doctrine, force structure, training and education, and acquisition. Marine Corps Intelligence Activity 200px The Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA), created in 1987,http://www.hqmc.marines.mil/Portals/133/Docs/MCIA%20Marine%20and%20Civilian%20Interaction.pdf is a field activity headquarters of the United States Marine Corps, and a member of the United States Intelligence Community. The MCIA describes itself as: \\"a vital part of military intelligence 'corporate enterprise,' and functions in a collegial, effective manner with other service agencies and with the joint intelligence centers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Unified Commands.\\" The Marine Corps Intelligence Activity mission is to provide intelligence services to the Marine Corps and the U.S. Intelligence Community. These services are based on expeditionary mission profiles in littoral areas. It supports the development of service doctrine, force structure, training and education, and acquisition. MCIA determines what missions the Corps needs to carry out as well as who will need to be trained for that mission. MCIA is in partnership with Marine Corps Intelligence the Office of Naval Intelligence and Office of Coast Guard Intelligence in the National Maritime Intelligence- Integration Office and at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia. MCIA has administrative control of the Marine Cryptologic Support Battalion, which supports the National Security Agency. MCIA began as the Marine Corps Intelligence Command (MCIC), created in 1987 by then Commandant of the Marine Corps General Alfred M. Gray, Jr. He created MCIC to address the lack of expeditionary intelligence support for policy, acquisition, and operations, as each of the other service intelligence centers focused only on their needs. Colonel Walter Breede III was the first Director. The flagship study of the Center, \\"Planning and Programming Factors for Expeditionary Operations in the Third World\\", was published by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) in March 1990, and was unusual for relying exclusively on open sources of information for creating a matrix of 143 mission area factors that could be objectively evaluated in relation to five degrees of difficulty, and for being published as an unclassified rather than a classified study. Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Enterprise (MCISR-E) The MCISR-E is a warfighting enterprise that supports decision-making through the provision of tailored intelligence that is timely, relevant, and predictive. The enterprise supports institutional decision-making through both the provision of relevant intelligence and the comprehensive integration of the intelligence warfighting function in operating concepts, structural decisions, and material investments. The multi-domain, collaborative, worldwide construct of the MCISR-E provides the crucial edge across the spectrum for both deployed and CONUS-based MAGTFs. What drives the MCISR-E is not the crisis of the moment but rather, the incorporation of a \\"24/7/365\\" predictive analysis process with the global reach of operational MAGTF Intelligence Centers (MICs) backed by the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA) and its connectivity to the Combat Support Agencies (CSAs) and National Intelligence Community (IC). To ensure its viability, Marine Corps Intelligence will continue to remain vigilant over a complex, technically sophisticated threat environment and evolve by seizing technological opportunities to increase MCISR-E capabilities and capacities. An intelligent workforce, uniformed and civilian, anchors the MCISR-E with the skills, professional acumen, and functional expertise that mark them as a world-class contributor to our Corps and IC missions.https://marinecorpsconceptsandprograms.com/programs/intelligence- surveillance-and-reconnaissance/marine-corps-intelligence-surveillance-and Marine Corps Counterintelligence Marine Corps Counterintelligence (CI) is composed of Marine Counterintelligence Agents who conduct tactical Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT) operations. All CI/HUMINT Marines must successfully complete the 17-week Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) CI/HUMINT Basic Course conducted at the Navy & Marine Corps Intelligence Training Center (NMITC), in Dam Neck, Virginia. Upon graduation, CI/HUMINT Marines are accredited Counterintelligence Agents and are issued Marine Corps Counterintelligence Badge and Credentials.Marine Corps Counterintelligence Badge Marine Counterintelligence Agents work to detect and prevent acts of terrorism, espionage, sabotage, subversion, sedition, treason and assassination. Marine Counterintelligence Agents also investigate cases of friendly personnel who may be Prisoners of War (POW), Missing In Action (MIA) or defectors. CI investigations within the Department of the Navy fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). During combat operations, the exclusive CI investigative jurisdiction held by NCIS in garrison is assigned to MAGTF commanders and is executed by Marine Counterintelligence Agents under the staff cognizance of the unit intelligence officer. While conducting operations in tactical environments, Marine CI/HUMINT personnel often work in small teams called HUMINT Exploitation Teams (HET). HET's are designed to not only collect and report HUMINT information but to also exploit that intelligence information by acting on it. HET's also conduct Counterintelligence activities designed to deny, detect and deceive the enemy's ability to target friendly forces. CI/HUMINT Non-Commissioned Officers are designated as \\"Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence Specialist\\" (MOS 0211). CI/HUMINT Warrant Officers are designated as \\"Counterintelligence Officer\\" (MOS 0210). CI/HUMINT Commissioned Officers are designated as \\"Human Source Intelligence Officer\\" (MOS 0204). CI/HUMINT Marines attend US Army Airborne School and Survival, Evasion, Resistance & Escape (SERE) School. Eligible CI/HUMINT Marines will attend language training at the Defense Language Institute (DLI) in Monterrey, California. Technically-qualified CI/HUMINT Marines may be selected for Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) training. Advanced training is available for qualified CI/HUMINT Marines from agencies within and outside the Department of Defense. Highly- qualified CI/HUMINT Marines may be selected to serve in operational or strategic-level billets in Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), NCIS, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) or other government agencies. History 200px The Intelligence Department was established as on 27 April 2000 by General James L. Jones, USMC Commandant of the Marine Corps. Upon creating the Intelligence Department General Jones said: ‚ÄúI hope all Marines will recognize both the emblematic and practical significance of the Commandant having a ‚ÄúG2‚Äù who can serve as both a proponent for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance inside the combat development process and as the focal point for leveraging intelligence community support for our warfighting capability.‚Äù Source: CMC message 270849Z APR 00. 1994 Intelligence Plan A major reinvigoration of Marine Corps Intelligence occurred in 1994, often called the \\"Van Riper Plan\\" after the Director of Intelligence at that time. The Intel Plan assigned the following mission to Marine Corps Intelligence: ‚ÄúProvide Commanders at every level with tailored, timely, minimum essential intelligence, and ensure that this intelligence is integrated into the operational planning process.‚Äù The Intel Plan was announced in March 1995 via All Marine (ALMAR) message 100/95. Early history Marine Corps Intelligence is widely believed to have been established when CMC created the M-2 in 1939. According to HQ Memo 1-1939, dtd 21 Apr 1939, CMC redesignated the Division of Operations and Training as the Division of Plans and Policies. The new Division retained the same subdivisions as the old with the standard number designations of a general or executive staff, but designated \\"M\\" rather than \\"G.\\" Under the supervision of a Director, the Division contained the standard M‚Äîl, Personnel; M-2, Intelligence; M-3, Training; and M-4, Supply and Equipment Sections and an M-5, War Plans Section, which was to be abolished in the fall of 1941, with M-5 functions being absorbed by M-3. Some trace the establishment of Marine Corps Intelligence to 1920 because the Division of Operations and Training, which was created by Marine Corps Order of 1 December 1920 and may have been based on a CMC ltr to Col John H. Russell, dtd 19 Dec 1918, subj: Organization of Planning Section, 2385/130‚Äì30, was composed of Operations, Training, Military Education, Military Intelligence, and Aviation Sections. This MI Section is viewed by some as the establishment of Marine Corps Intelligence.

The BTC also encourages the study, preservation and interpretation of the William Bartram heritage at both cultural and natural sites in Trail states. The North Carolina Bartram Trail Society was organized in 1977. The Society reached an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to mark the general trail corridor within the Nantahala National Forest, and to blaze and build the trail, which was completed. They conduct meetings in the Spring and Fall each year, and organize trail work hikes. Georgia Bartram Trail on Rabun Bald In Georgia, the Bartram Trail covers . After entering Georgia from North Carolina, the trail follows a ridge line to its highest point in Georgia at Rabun Bald , , the second-highest point in the state, along the Eastern Continental Divide. From there it passes Martin Creek Falls and Becky Branch Falls as it drops to go through Warwoman Dell. From Warwoman Dell, it climbs again before dropping to its lowest elevations along a stretch of the Wild and Scenic Chattooga River. In addition to a number of waterfalls like Martin Creek Falls and Becky Branch Falls and vistas from Rabun Bald, the Bartram Trail offers a great deal of scenic beauty.

Main tasks GSP perform are Geological, Geophysical and Geo-chemical Mapping of Pakistan. Target of these mapping are resources exploration, Geo-Engineering assessment, Geo-hazard prediction/prevention and addressing environmental issue. Apart from studying geology, it has various major science disciplines, concerning biology, engineering, hydrology, chemistry and physics. Due to its reputation and studies on fact-finding research, it has undertaken various efforts and studies on mineral exploration. Headquartered in Quetta and other regional offices in all over the country, and as of current, Dr. Tanveer Ahmed Qureshi is the current and designated director-general of the Geological Survey of Pakistan. History GSI and BGS in 1851. As early as 1836‚Äì51, the British crown government decided to set up the geological survey to explore the British Indian Empire under the British geologist David Williams who later founded the Geological Survey of India.copy in Bavarian State Library (also Horizontal and Vertical Sections) After the independence of Pakistan from the British Indian Empire, the Geological Survey of India's north-west branch, staff and assets were evolved into creating to Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP). At the time of its establishment, the GSP had consisted of only six geologist and two chemists under British scientist H.L. Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working. Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948. In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and engineering but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the military. In 1949‚Äì55, the GSP initiated a rigorous tradition of field investigations with the governmental support, and reconnaissance technology was transferred to GSP through the Colombo Plan. Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government. In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, photogeology sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in Quetta was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director. A Topographic map of Pakistan. By 1956, the GSP worked extremely close with the United States Geological Survey (USGS); the USGS established multimillion- dollar work laboratories and facilities in all over the country and cooperation continued until 1970. In 1957, the GSP discovered the large stockpiles of uranium in Sindh and Punjab. In addition, the GSP helped established country's universities to teach geoscience and engineering as part of their university programmes. In the 1970s, due to its expansion and scientific capabilities, the GSP was instrumental in carrying out work on nuclear geography, when its scientists frequently visited in various mountain ranges of the country. The GSP notably carried out an ingenious work on nuclear geology and geography as part of the clandestine atomic bomb project, and played an integral role in the selection of the test sites. Throughout this time, the GSP's scientists continued exploring uranium and plutonium, as well as other material sources in all over the country. In 1992, The GSP announced the discovery of the huge deposits of coal at Thar Desert in Sindh. The GSP sponsored and published various studies on the geology of Thar Desert. In the 1990s, the GSP issued and produced several maps of atlas of Pakistan, with mapping at 1:1 000 000 scale and a variety of themes published at 1:5 000 000. Economic liberalization policies of government in 1992 led the ADB to sponsor a 10-year-long multibillion-dollar mineral exploration programme to cover 14 identified mineralized zones in the country. In the 1990s, the GSP also discovered the large deposits of Gold and Copper in Western Balochistan, southwest Pakistan. In the 2000s, the GSP gained international and public prominence when its scientists discovered and unearthed the first ever dinosaur fossils in Pakistan. The remains were thought to be around ~70 million years old and were found by geologists mapping the Barkhan district of the country's arid Balochistan province. The specimens include legs and vertebrae. Annotated and historical map of Pakistan. =GSP Head Quarter= Geological Survey of Pakistan Head Quarter is located in western city of Pakistan, Quetta.

In the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the ship was unsafe and not seaworthy, and never should have sailed. The final report suggested four causes of the disaster, all due to poor design and maintenance of the ship. The loss of the ship was the subject of lengthy litigation between the owner and families of the missing men. Despite the clear cause of the disaster, an inaccurate and incomplete version of the ship's disappearance is often used to justify Bermuda Triangle conspiracies.  History  The vessel, originally named SS Esso New Haven, was built by Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, in March 1944, one of many T2 tankers built to carry and transport oil. In 1960, she was placed in dry dock by Bethlehem Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland, converted to carrying a cargo of molten sulphur, and given a name change to Marine Sulphur Queen. In order to carry out the planned function of carrying molten sulphur, a continuous, independent tank 306 feet long, 30 feet 6 inches wide and 33 feet high was constructed out of the original holds, necessitating the removal of all transverse bulkheads in the original centerline tanks and modifying the internal structure; this tank in turn was divided into four smaller tanks internally. A void surrounded the tank on all sides, leaving a 2-foot clearance on the sides and bottom, with three feet left between the top and the ship's weather deck. A steam system was installed throughout to maintain the molten sulphur at roughly . The ship's last voyage began on 2 February 1963 out of Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of sulphur weighing 15,260 tons. On 4 February, near Florida, an ordinary radio message was sent by a crewman, giving the position of the ship at . Marine Sulphur Queen was listed as missing on 6 February. A search of the Straits of Florida where the ship was believed to have gone down was called off after 19 days, after yielding life preservers and some debris, but no trace of the ship or the 39 men aboard her. At the time of her 4 February position, she was in rough, nearly-following seas of 16 feet, with northerly winds of 25‚Äì46 knots.  Investigation  The remains of the SS Marine Sulphur Queen, recovered by the US Coast Guard A Coast Guard investigation concluded several facts about the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and along the sides of the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure. The Coast Guard also noted that the T2 tanker class had a characteristic that it has a \\"weak back\\", meaning the keel would split at a point weakened by corrosion, usually around midships. Such a splitting had happened on several T2 tankers, and many were discovered during inspections to have hairline or larger fractures within the keel and on major frames. Companies who owned T2 tankers were ordered to pay attention to the keel when inspecting. Former crewmen also testified that corrosion was everywhere, mentioning inoperable temperature gauges, a ruptured steam coil, and worn packing around the screws. It was recorded that Marine Sulphur Queen was scheduled for a drydock inspection in January 1963, but it was postponed by the owners, who had complained that cargo deliveries were behind and they needed their ships to catch up. One new crewman, on reporting to the ship just before it sailed for the last time, turned to his wife and pronounced it \\"a floating garbage can.\\"Investigations: The Queen with the Weak Back. TIME (8 March 1963). In the closing of the inquiry the Coast Guard had this to say: :\\"1. In view of the vast search operations conducted and the debris found and identified as coming from the MARINE SULPHUR QUEEN, the ship and her entire crew of 39 men are presumed to be lost. :2. Concurring with the Board, the vessel apparently was lost on 4 February 1963 on its approach to, or in the vicinity of, the Straits of Florida. :3. Further concurring with the Board, in the absence of survivors or physical remains of the ship, the exact cause of the loss of the MARINE SULPHUR QUEEN cannot be determined. :4. The Board considered many possibilities which may have caused the loss of the ship and rightly declined to assign any order of probability to these causes. In its conclusions the Board commented on the following possible causes: ::a. An explosion may have occurred in the cargo tanks. ::b. A complete failure of the vessel's hull girder may have caused it to break in two ::c. The vessel may have capsized in synchronous rolling ::d. A steam explosion may have occurred as the result of a rapid filling of the void space with water. ::The record contains ample evidence to support the Board's suppositions.\\" The Coast Guard also recommended that no remaining T2 tanker be converted into a sulphur carrier without taking into consideration the structure of the ship as originally built. \\"First, the acceptability of any conversion must be considered on its individual merits, having regard for the existing condition of the vessel and the proposed cargo, route, and service. Secondly, the objection to the conversion of an existing T2 or another tanker of comparable age is associated with the probable condition of the vessel, particularly the cargo portion, due to age, as much as it is due to design considerations.\\"  Litigation  The loss of the ship was subject of a lawsuit filed within weeks of the sinking by relatives of the crew members seeking $2.5 million in damages under two specific federal acts (the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. ¬ß 688; and the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. ¬ß 761), based upon maritime laws regarding the unseaworthiness of a vessel. Marine Sulphur Transport Corporation (the owners of the ship), and Marine Transport Lines, Inc. (demise charterer) petitioned for exoneration or at least a limitation of liability. The amount of damages sought would grow to $20 million by 1969. The United States Court of Appeals (2nd Circuit) concluded that: *the ship was not structurally sound as a result of the sulphur tank conversion; *the tank was centered too narrowly within the ship resulting in a high center of gravity, which meant that during a roll in heavy seas, it would take longer to recover. *the ship was not properly inspected nor maintained by the owners; In its 25 April 1972 ruling the court denied the exoneration of the owners and found them liable in regard to the unseaworthiness of the ship. It awarded damages to the crew relatives, but denied them punitive damages; the reason for it, as stated in the Coast Guard report, was that no one knew how the ship was lost, and in the absence of the remains of the vessel, they could go no further: \\"The wrongful death claimants therefore sustained their burden of proving unseaworthiness and there remained only the issue of whether or not one or more of the conditions of unseaworthiness or some other agency caused the disaster. The court found in explicit terms that 'no one knows how the ship was lost.' The resolution of the question of liability will, under the circumstances, be determined by the allocation of the burden of proof on the causation issue, the existence of a rebuttable presumption and whether or not that presumption has been met.\\"  Precedent  SS Schenectady, showing her bad keel. Nearly 20 years prior to the loss of the Marine Sulphur Queen, the United States General Accounting Office published a report titled TO INQUIRE INTO THE DESIGN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION OF WELDED STEEL MERCHANT VESSELS, 15 July 1946, which was essentially a report of concern over civilian merchant ships, specifically T2 tankers, fracturing amidships at the keel. Even during World War II, the federal government was concerned over the large number of merchant ship casualties not resulting from combat, and investigation centered on possible shoddy construction. A sister ship, SS Sylvia L. Ossa, went down in heavy seas east of Bermuda on 15 October 1976; all that was recovered was debris and a lifeboat in which the quick-release mechanism was still intact.  Bermuda Triangle connection  The loss of the ship and crew with no trace other than bits of debris placed it on the list of incidents in the Bermuda Triangle. Writers of the subject have placed this ship in every work, sometimes agreeing with the Coast Guard report, other times coming up with their own theories. Vincent Gaddis was the first writer to coin the name Bermuda Triangle in his article for Argosy Magazine in the February 1964 issue, and Marine Sulphur Queen was the first Triangle \\"victim\\" he mentioned, barely a year after the ship sank: \\"With a crew of thirty-nine, the tanker Marine Sulphur Queen began its final voyage on 2 February 1963, from Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of molten sulphur. Its destination was Norfolk, Virginia, but it actually sailed into the unknown...\\"http://www.physics.smu.edu/~pseudo/BermudaTriangle/vincentgaddis.txt Gaddis himself gave no theory as to the sinking, and ignored the many physical and personnel discrepancies cited by the Coast Guard. What he did was to reduce the loss of the ship to sailing \\"into the unknown\\", as did many writers after him. The effect was to leave an aura of mystery, and as such, many theories, some very outlandish, have been postulated to explain the disappearance of the ship. The Sci-Fi Channel posted a summary of its program The Bermuda Triangle: Startling New Secrets on its website, in which it said that all that was recovered was a lifeboat. The Coast Guard had listed all that was recovered and identified for its report, as well as assembling the items for public display during the inquiry, which was photographed. A lifeboat was not among the debris, nor was one recovered. A 1977 episode of In Search Of discussed the Marine Sulphur Queen incident.

Dedicated and opened in 1988, the college sits on a Lonestar College-Tomball History (.5787 km¬≤) on SH 249 north of FM 2920 and just south of Spring Creek, which acts as the border between Harris County and Montgomery County. The mailing address for the campus is 30555 Tomball Highway, Tomball, TX, 77375. Facilities In 1985, LSCS purchased in northwest Tomball, Texas. A single megastructure was chosen as the design instead of building several different buildings. The basic design is a cruciform design with each of the four wings named after the compass direction that it points in, resulting in a North, South, East and West wing. Since then the college has grown in size. First the South Wing was expanded; several years later, the college went through a major expansion. In this expansion, the West wing was extended; however, the major work occurred in the East Wing, which greatly extended the size of the campus. In 2005, another expansion project was finished, during which time the library was moved and expanded to its current form as a joint project with Harris County. Also in the project, a Wellness Center, with dance studio, racquetball courts, basketball court, rock-climbing wall, indoor walking track, and various weight-lifting and exercise machines was opened in the North Wing.

He represented Texas in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. In 1915, he received an appointment as assistant Attorney General in the Territory of Hawaii, where he lived the rest of his life. Early life Vaughan was born to attorney George T. and Tippah Leary Vaughan, on December 2, 1867 in Marion County, Texas. He was of English ancestry, descended from early Jamestown, Virginia settler John Vaughn. He married Pearl Lockett in 1888. They were the parents of Aileen, Robert Louis and Jean. Vaughn was mostly self-taught, by reading his father's books. He was admitted to the bar in 1885, and began an active practice the next year. Legislative career =Texas= From 1890 to 1898 he was city attorney for Texarkana, Texas. From 1910 until 1912 he was a member of the Texas State Senate and in the United States House of Representatives from 1913 to 1915. =Hawaii= Vaughan moved to Honolulu in the Territory of Hawaii and became assistant United States district attorney on October 1, 1915. By December 22, 1915 he was promoted to United States district attorney, and after the retirement of Sanford B. Dole was appointed by Woodrow Wilson as judge of the territorial United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on May 15, 1916. Vaughan was a political supporter of Woodrow Wilson and advocated states to pass prohibition, which he opposed at a national level because he believed that it would violate states rights. Personal life and death Vaughan married Pearl Lockett on November 21, 1888. The couple had three children. Their only son US Navy Lt. Robert Louis Vaughan (1892‚Äì1920) died in a plane crash related to his military service.

Father Louis Gaufridi was accused and convicted of causing the possession by a pact with the devil, and he was executed by strangulation and his body burned. This case provided the legal precedent for the conviction and execution of Urbain Grandier at Loudun more than 20 years later. Madeleine de Demandolx The early 17th century was host to the peak of accusations in France's witchcraft hunt. Prior to the 17th century the testimony of a person perceived to be possessed was not considered reliable as anything they might say was likely from the \\"Father of Lies\\".(John 8:44)Guiley, Rosemary. \\"Aix-en-Provence, Possessions\\", The Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 5 Madeleine de Demandolx de la Palud was a young French aristocrat, 17 years of age. Father Louis Gaufridi was the parish priest.Arrest de la Cour de Parlement de Provence, portant condamnation contre Messire Louis Gaufridi, (Aix: Jean Tholozan, 1611) In 1607 Demandolx entered the Ursuline convent at Marseille where she confessed to the superior that she had been intimate with Gaufridi. The mother superior then sent her to Aix to place Demandolx some distance from Gaufridi. In the summer of 1609, Demandolx began to exhibit convulsions, shaking and other symptoms of what was taken to be demonic possession, and the condition seemed to be contagious, as other nuns also began to show symptoms. All attempts at exorcism proved unsuccessful. When the priest at Aix confronted Gaufridi about the alleged affair, he denied it. Investigation Demandolx and Louise Capeau were referred to S√©bastien Micha√´lis, prior of the Dominican community of Saint-Maxim and French inquisitor. Michaelis was assisted in his investigation by another Dominican, Father Doncieux. In the winter of 1610, they underwent further attempts at exorcism at Sainte-Baume in a holy cave where, according to tradition, Mary Magdalen had once lived. The women appeared to be trying to outdo each other. Capeau would speak in a deep bass voice; Demandolx would scream obscenities. All were convinced they were possessed. During one of these sessions Gaufridi was claimed to have seduced Demandolx, to have caused her to become possessed, and taken her to sabbats.Walker, Anita M., and Edmund H. Dickerman. ‚ÄúA Notorious Woman: Possession, Witchcraft and Sexuality in Seventeenth-Century Provence.‚Äù Historical Reflections / R√©flexions Historiques, vol. 27, no. 1, 2001, JSTOR Anti-clerical French republican Jules Michelet gives credence to the claim that Gaufridi seduced Demandolx, and perhaps others. However, Michelet views Gaufridi, not as a parish priest of Marseille, but the spiritual director of the nuns at Aix, where, due to their monotonous lives and excessive imagination, most of them were infatuated with the priest. He suggests that Capeau was both jealous and \\"a trifle mad\\".Michelet, Jules. La Sorci√®re: The Witch of the Middle Ages, London. Simpkin, Marshall. and Company, 1863, pp. 228 et seq. Marseille supported Gaufridi, not wishing to see the Inquisition at Avignon spread to their environs. The Bishop and chapter attributed the whole affair to the antipathy the monks had towards secular priests. The Franciscans, rivals to the Dominicans, also supported Gaufridi. At one point, when a friar place a holy relic on her Capeau said, \\"Gaufridi is no magician at all, and therefore could not be arrested.\\" She subsequently recovered and stated that the Capuchins had failed to make the devil swear to tell the truth. Gaufridi's appeal to Parliament was headed off by Micha√´lis, who filed his appeal first. Capeau claimed to be possessed by a devil named \\"Verrine\\". When caught in inconsistent statements, Capeau responded \\"The Devil is the Father of Lies\\". The interrogation of the parties attracted a number of spectators, and Capeau soon outdrew Micha√´lis's preaching. According to Michelet, Micha√´lis would have put an end to it had it been only Capeau. Because of her general lack of credibility, Gaufridi would not have been condemned on her testimony alone, but the younger Demandolx was afraid of Capeau and lest she also be accused, confirmed whatever the older woman said. In court, Father Gaufridi strongly recanted the confession extracted from him by torture. In the eyes of the court, the protest was useless: the signed confession and alleged pact were evidence weighty enough to sentence the priest to death by fire. Even after the sentence was given, inquisitors continued to demand the names of Gaufridi's accomplices. The sentence of Aix-en-Provence April 30, 1611, was the day of Father Gaufridi's execution. With head and feet bare, a rope around his neck, Gaufridi officially asked pardon of God and was handed over to torturers. Still living after the torture of strappado and squassation, Gaufridi was escorted by archers while dragged through the streets of Aix for five hours before arriving at the place of execution. The priest was granted the mercy of strangulation before his body was burned to ashes. Immediately following Gaufridi's execution Demandolx was apparently suddenly free of all possession. Her fellow demoniac, Sister Louise Capeau, was possessed until she died. Capeau accused a blind girl who was executed in July 1611. Both of the sisters were banished from the convent, but Madeleine remained under the watch of the Inquisition. She was charged with witchcraft in 1642 and again in 1652. During her second trial, Madeleine was again found to have the Devil's mark and was sentenced to imprisonment. At an advanced age, she was released to the custody of a relative and died in 1670 at the age of 77. Aix-en-Provence sets precedent The hysteria begun at Aix did not end with Gaufridi's sentence and the banishment of the nuns. In 1613, two years later, the possession hysteria spread to Lille where three nuns reported that Sister Marie de Sains had bewitched them. Sister Marie's testimony was a near copy of Sister Madeleine's renouncement two years earlier. More than 20 years later, in 1634, the Aix-en-Provence possessions set precedent for the conviction and execution of Urbain Grandier.

Wesely's developments, inspired by Kriegsspiel wargames, were important and influential in the early history of role-playing games.  Early life and education  Dave Wesely was born in 1945. Wesely studied physics at Hamline University, in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  Strategos  Strategos (1880), Table T, used for combat resolution In 1967, Wesely rediscovered the 19th-century professional wargame Strategos, by Charles A. L. Totten, at the University of Minnesota library. An avid hobby wargamer and reader of wargaming literature, Wesely seized upon these rules and incorporated their principles into the miniature wargames played by the Midwest Military Simulation Association (MMSA). These included the role of the referee, and the principle of free kriegsspiel that players could attempt anything, although not always successfully, and that the referee should be able to make judgements to cover anything not ordinarily covered by the rules. Totten's Strategos became the cornerstone text for the Twin Cities gamers.  Strategos N  The incorporation of Totten's Strategos into MMSA wargaming culminated with the 1968 development of Strategos N, a compact set of Napoleonic wargaming rules devised by Wesely and other MMSA members. Dave Wesely developed Strategos N as the first MMSA Strategos variant for the first time in 1968. It was later self-published in 1970, and again in 1984.  Strategos C  Dave Wesely developed Strategos C for wargames set during the American Civil War, and it circulated in draft form in 1969, acting as a precursor to Valley Forge (1976).  Role-playing games  The concept of the referee in Totten's Strategos led to Dave Wesely expanding upon these ideas to create the Braunstein games, which were influential in the early history of role-playing games. This development of the role of the referee became a catalyst for the evolution of role-playing games. In a 1981 interview published in Pegasus Magazine, Dave Arneson described Wesely's Braunstein as a game in which each player had a \\"role\\" that they were playing. He also described his Blackmoor game as a variation of Dave Wesely's earlier Braunstein, based on Wesely's ideas about role-playing, but set in a fantasy world. Peterson cites Arneson's Blackmoor as being the most significant precursor to Dungeons & Dragons.  Valley Forge  Wesely created the wargame Valley Forge, which was published by TSR Hobbies in 1976. Dave Arneson wrote an introduction for the game. Peterson describes Valley Forge as an adaptation of Strategos N to the American Revolutionary War. Video games Wesely designed video games for Discovery Games, including Winged Samurai.

Established in 1915, Grady College offers undergraduate degrees in journalism, advertising, public relations, and entertainment and media studies, along with master‚Äôs and doctoral programs of study. Grady has consistently been ranked among the top schools of journalism education and research in the U.S. It is home to several prominent centers, awards, and institutes, including the Peabody Awards, recognized as one of the most prestigious awards in electronic journalism, the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage, the James M. Cox Jr. Center for International Mass Communication Training and Research, the New Media Institute, and National Press Photographers Association. History In 1915, Grady was founded as a school of journalism by Steadman Vincent Sanford, a young professor who later as president (1932‚Äì35) and chancellor (1935-45) of the University System of Georgia, was the architect of the modern University of Georgia. Classes were first held in the Academic Building near the university's iconic Arch just off Broad Street. Early courses included newspaper reporting and correspondence, editorial writing, history and principles of journalism, psychology of business procedure and newspaper advertising. In 1921, the school's name was changed to the Henry W. Grady School of Journalism in honor of university alumnus Henry W. Grady, an Athens native who served as part-owner and managing editor of the Atlanta Constitution in the 1880s. A Grady reporting class in 1941. Grady's first graduate, in 1921, Lamar Trotti, became a producer of major motion pictures for 20th Century Fox. He received an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay in 1945 for Wilson. The second graduate, in 1922, John Eldridge Drewry, became the school's longest serving director and dean (1932‚Äì69), and created a national reputation for the school. In 1940, Drewry established the George Foster Peabody Awards to address the fact that Columbia University, home of the Pulitzer Prize, did not accept radio broadcast entries (Peabody Awards for television were introduced in 1948 and categories for material distributed via the World Wide Web were added in the 1990s). By 1929, enrollment at Grady, which had moved into the south wing of the Commerce- Journalism Building the previous year, was nearly 70 students and included 20 women who graduated with bachelor's degrees in journalism. A master's degree program was authorized in 1938. In 1961, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, along with Hamilton E. Holmes, became the first two African-American students to desegregate the University of Georgia. In 1963, Hunter-Gault graduated with a journalism degree from Grady and went on to a notable career in multimedia news reporting. The current Journalism Building located just north of Sanford Stadium was dedicated in 1969. A doctoral program was established in 1983. Two years later, the James M. Cox Jr. Center for International Mass Communication Training and Research began operations and has since conducted hundreds of training programs involving countries across the world, and published numerous research and technical reports. The New Media Institute was founded in 2000 to explore the creative, critical and commercial implications of emerging digital communication technologies. In 2015, the National Press Photographers Association moved its headquarters to Grady. Academics Grady comprises three academic departments: journalism, advertising and public relations, and entertainment and media studies. Admission to the undergraduate program is selective and open to students who have completed their sophomore year. The college provides instruction at the undergraduate and graduate levels in a range of subject areas including public relations, advertising, broadcast and multimedia journalism, photojournalism, new media, communication, publication management, media innovation and entrepreneurship, and screenwriting. Since 1968, Grady students have helped produce UGAzine, a lifestyle magazine that is self-sustaining through advertising revenue. Many students also work on the award-winning, independent student newspaper, The Red and Black, and its lifestyle publication, Ampersand Magazine, as well as the student-operated WUOG, a radio station broadcasting to Athens and surrounding areas. =Degrees offered by the college= * Bachelor of Arts in Journalism (A.B.J.) * Bachelor of Arts in Advertising (A.B.J.) * Bachelor of Arts in Public Relations (A.B.J.) * Bachelor of Arts in Entertainment and Media Studies (A.B.J.) * Master of Arts in Journalism (M.A.) * Master of Arts in Advertising (M.A.) * Master of Arts in Public Relations (M.A.) * Master of Arts in AdPR 4+1 (M.A.) * Master of Arts in Mass Media Studies (M.A.) * Master of Arts in Health and Medical Journalism (M.A.) * Master of Arts in Emerging Media (M.A.) * Master of Fine Arts in Narrative Media Writing (MFA) * Master of Fine Arts in Screenwriting (MFA) * Doctor of Philosophy in Mass Communication (Ph.D.) =Certificates offered by the college= * Grady Sports Media Certificate * New Media Institute Certificate * Media Analytics Certificate * Public Affairs Professional Certificate Journalism Building, Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

In 1938, leaders of the National Association of Broadcasters asked Lambdin Kay, WSB station manager in Atlanta, to create an award for excellence in broadcasting. He turned to Drewy, Grady's dean, for sponsorship. The result was the creation in 1940 of the George Foster Peabody Awards, named after a benefactor to the University of Georgia. The next year, the Peabody Awards were first presented to six distinguished radio winners at the Commodore Hotel in New York City. Grady has since administered the award to recognize outstanding achievements in radio, television and digital media. More than a thousand submissions are judged annually by the Peabody Board of Jurors, made up of respected media professionals, media scholars, critics and journalists. The board meets at least three times, with the final viewing and discussion session held at the university. To win a Peabody in one of about 30 categories, ranging from news, entertainment and public service to documentary, children‚Äôs and web/interactive programming, a program must receive the unanimous approval of all board members. Past Peabody winners include Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, Barbara Walters, BBC, 60 Minutes and Al Jazeera.

The song was written by Paul Stanley and producer Bob Ezrin. The song is one of the band's most popular and is a classic rock staple. It is also seen as one of the more technical songs musically in the band's canon. The song has been noted for being a duet between guitarists Stanley and Ace Frehley. Composition and release The song, recorded and released as a single in 1976, was the third single from Kiss's album Destroyer and was planned to be their last in support of the album. As a single, it did poorly in sales and radio play (other than in Detroit), and failed to chart in the U.S. even though it would prove to be a fan favorite. It came as a surprise that the B-side \\"Beth\\", a ballad written and sung by drummer Peter Criss, wound up catching on in different markets in the U.S., so the single was reissued with \\"Beth\\" as the A-side and \\"Detroit Rock City\\" as the B-side. While the song briefly references Detroit, the real- life incident which inspired the lyric evidently did not take place there. \\"I had the basic riff of the song, the 'Get up, get down' part,\\" Stanley recalls, \\"but I didn't know what the song was about except it was about Detroit. And then I remembered on the previous tour, I think it was in Charlotte, somebody had gotten hit by a car and killed outside the arena. I remember thinking how weird it is that people's lives end so quickly. People can be on their way to something that's really a party and a celebration of being alive and die in the process of doing it. So that became the basis for the lyric.\\"Leaf, David and Ken Sharp, KISS: Behind the Mask - The Official Authorized Biography On Destroyer, the song segues into \\"King of the Night Time World\\", via the sounds of a car crash. The songs were played together on the Destroyer tour. During the Rock And Roll Over tour, Stanley changed the lyric, \\"I know I'm gonna die, why?\\" to \\"I know I'm gonna die, and I don't care!\\" The song was ranked at number six on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs and is featured on the album Heavy MetalThe First 20 Years. \\"Detroit Rock City\\" was based on an earlier song that Kiss performed only in concert called \\"Acrobat\\".

It was the second animated spin-off of the sitcom Gilligan's Island (the first being The New Adventures of Gilligan). Gilligan's Planet was the last cartoon series that Filmation produced for Saturday mornings; afterwards, they transitioned from Saturday mornings to producing cartoons exclusively for syndication. It was also the first Filmation series to feature the Lou Scheimer \\"signature\\" credit (as opposed to the rotating Lou Scheimer/Norm Prescott \\"wheel\\" credit which had been used since 1969). In addition, it was one of the last 1980s Saturday morning cartoons to be fitted with an adult laugh track, as the popularity of the practice had subsided. Gilligan's Planet featured all of the original actors but one; Tina Louise, who has consistently refused to participate in any Gilligan's Island-related material since the series ended, again declined to reprise her role as Ginger Grant, who again was portrayed as a platinum blonde (as was the case in The New Adventures) instead of Louise's red hair. Dawn Wells, who had been unavailable during the production of The New Adventures of Gilligan, returned to the franchise, voicing both her own character (Mary Ann Summers) and Ginger. Premise Gilligan's Planet is based on the premise that the Professor had managed to build an operational interplanetary spaceship to get the castaways of the original series off the island. This series creates a different timeline for the Gilligan franchise, rendering the two Universal Television movie sequels necessarily in a different continuity, as those films had integrated the cast back into society. True to the castaways' perpetual bad luck, they rocketed off into space and crash-landed on an unknown planet that supported human life. In many ways, the planet was like the island, but with a strangely colored and cratered surface with more land to get around. The rocket was severely damaged in the crash; thus, the castaways were still stranded and the Professor resumed his attempts to repair their only way home. Overall, Gilligan's Planet re-presented the source material of the original live-action series with space and alien themes. Encounters with headhunters and other shipwrecked people instead became encounters with alien creatures. A new character named Bumper was added, who appeared as a reptilian alien pet/sidekick for Gilligan and company. Production notes The theme song from The New Adventures of Gilligan was recycled, with new narration to explain the new show's premise. Sherwood Schwartz, who had hands-on involvement in the New Adventures series, was not as heavily involved in Gilligan's Planet. Two of the show's primary writers, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini, would emerge at Warner Bros. Animation in the 1990s. This is one of the few Filmation series not currently owned by successor Universal Television/Classic Media. It is instead owned by Turner Entertainment (via Warner Bros. Television) as it is a part of their pre-1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library.

It is found in south-western Asia from India to the Arabian peninsula. Taxonomy and systematics The white-eared bulbul was originally described in the genus Ixos. The white-eared bulbul is considered to belong to a superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, Cape bulbul, and the common bulbul. Formerly, some authorities considered the white-eared bulbul to be a subspecies of the Himalayan Bulbul. The alternate name, white-cheeked bulbul, is also used by the Himalayan bulbul. In Iran it is sometimes referred to as \\"the bulbul of Tehran\\".http://fhnews.ir/fa/news/79802/The Bulbul of Tehran =Subspecies= Two subspecies are recognized: * Arabian white-cheeked bulbul (P. l. mesopotamia) - Ticehurst, 1918: Found in north-eastern Arabia, southern Iraq and south-western Iran * P. l. leucotis - (Gould, 1836): Found in southern Iran, southern Afghanistan, Pakistan and north-western India Description This species is very similar in appearance to the Himalayan white-cheeked bulbul but smaller and uncrested, and with a larger white cheek patch. It has a pale bare eye-ring. The vent is orange yellow. Sexes are alike. It is found in scrub forest and gardenland. Also found in flocks or pairs in the mangroves, gorging on the fruits of the Meswak bush. Usually seen in pairs or small groups. It feeds on fruits and insects, and breeds in March‚ÄìJune.

She first gained media attention in 2003, when she was badly injured when a car crashed into her day care centre. She suffered third-degree burns to 85% of her body and was hospitalised for several weeks where she lost both feet, a number of fingers, and an ear. She was involved in a second serious car accident in 2006. Her family has become major fundraisers and activists for victims who suffered conditions as Sophie's, and have also assisted in fundraising for the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Westmead. Family Delezio is the first daughter of Ron Delezio and Carolyn Martin and the younger sister of Mitchell Delezio and half-sister of Catherine Delezio and John Delezio. First accident Delezio first came to the attention of the public on 15 December 2003 when she and Molly Wood, both two years old at the time, were badly injured when they were trapped under a burning car which had crashed through the window of the Roundhouse Childcare Centre in Fairlight, Sydney, Australia. She suffered burns to 85% of her body, was hospitalised for several weeks, and lost both feet, one hand, and her right ear. Wood suffered burns to 40% of her body, but has since made a good recovery. Delezio was released from Westmead Children's Hospital on Monday 21 June 2004. The circumstances of the accident, and the rescue of the children by passers-by and members of the emergency services (for which a number received bravery awards) made them the subject of national news coverage. The driver who crashed into the child care centre, Donald John McNeall, was 68 at the time of the accident. He was cleared of negligent driving before a magistrate's court it as it could be not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not have a seizure. In late 2004, Delezio's parents founded the Day of Difference Foundation, a charity dedicated to raising funds for research into pediatric burns and related diseases. As of 2009, the foundation has raised over $6.5 million. In January 2006, Delezio was enrolled at the publicly funded Balgowlah Heights Public School. The school was extensively refurbished to accommodate the needs of Delezio. Due to the driver not being found liable, nobody was responsible for Delezio's extensive medical costs. However, the driver's compulsory third party insurance provider, the National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA), covered the costs ex-gratia. Due to this loophole in insurance coverage the NSW government introduced the Children's Special Benefit for children under 16 where no insurance coverage is available and later introduced a similar scheme to cover third parties of any age injured in an accident where nobody is liable called \\"Blameless Accidents\\". In 2005, journalist Mark Whittaker won a Walkley Award for his harrowing account of the rescue of dozens of children from inside The Roundhouse Childcare Centre by a large group of people who were unknown to each other.Originally published in The Weekend Australian, the account was adapted to become the first chapter of Whittaker's book, Brave. Second accident On 5 May 2006, Delezio made national headlines a second time when she was again badly injured in a road accident. While being pushed across a crossing by her nanny in a wheelchair (her service dog Tara by her side) near her home in Sydney's northern beaches, she was hit by a car and thrown 18 metres. Delezio suffered a heart attack, a broken jaw, a broken shoulder, bruising to her head, numerous rib fractures and a tear to her left lung. She was treated at the Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick. She left hospital and returned home to continue her recovery on 7 June 2006. An 80-year-old man, John George Sharman, was charged in relation to the second accident with \\"dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and not giving way to a pedestrian on a crossing\\". Having pleaded guilty Sharman was in October 2006 placed on a good behaviour bond for 18 months and suspended from driving for a year. Delezio's father maintained that while accidents do happen, reconstruction of the pedestrian crossing in question must be commenced, due to the number of incidents occurring. On 16 July 2006, Delezio's story was told on Channel 7's True Stories series. Life after the accidents Delezio returned to classes at Balgowlah Heights Public School on Thursday, 20 July 2006. In June 2011, it was reported that she aspired to be a paralympic swimmer. She later switched to rowing. In 2020 she appeared in Series 5 of Anh's Brush with Fame. Responses As a result of Delezio's accident, over $14 million had been raised by the foundation the Delezio family had set up, along with heightened public awareness for the need for adequate support and services for pediatric burns patients. Some of these funds were raised at the Kids 4 Kids Benefit Concert held on 10 September 2006. The Government of New South Wales has announced that it is investigating the possibility of reducing the age for mandatory medical checks for drivers from 80 to 75 years of age. It has agreed to install traffic lights at the crossing where the accident occurred. Periodically Delezio and the two accidents are referenced in the media particularly when concerns are raised about road safety in the vicinity of educational institutions. Sophie Delezio's father Ron Delezio was an Independent candidate in the 2017 Manly state by-election.

The stress intensity factor K characterises the load around a crack tip and the rate of crack growth is experimentally shown to be a function of the range of stress intensity \\\\Delta K seen in a loading cycle. The Paris equation is :\\\\begin{align} {da \\\\over dN} &= C\\\\left(\\\\Delta K\\\\right)^{m}, \\\\end{align} where a is the crack length and {\\\\rm d}a/{\\\\rm d}N is the fatigue crack growth for a load cycle N. The material coefficients C and m are obtained experimentally and also depend on environment, frequency, temperature and stress ratio. The stress intensity factor range has been found to correlate the rate of crack growth from a variety of different conditions and is the difference between the maximum and minimum stress intensity factors in a load cycle and is defined as : \\\\Delta K= K_{\\\\text{max}}-K_{\\\\text{min}}. Being a power law relationship between the crack growth rate during cyclic loading and the range of the stress intensity factor, the Paris‚ÄìErdogan equation can be visualized as a linear graph on a log-log plot, where the x-axis is denoted by the range of the stress intensity factor and the y-axis is denoted by the crack growth rate (see Figure 1). The equation gives the growth for a single cycle. Single cycles can be readily counted for constant-amplitude loading. Additional cycle identification techniques such as rainflow-counting algorithm need to be used to extract the equivalent constant-amplitude cycles from a variable-amplitude loading sequence.  History  In a 1961 paper, P. C. Paris introduced the idea that the rate of crack growth may depend on the stress intensity factor. Then in their 1963 paper, Paris and Erdogan indirectly suggested the equation with the aside remark \\"The authors are hesitant but cannot resist the temptation to draw the straight line slope 1/4 through the data...\\" after reviewing data on a log-log plot of crack growth versus stress intensity range. The Paris equation was then presented with the fixed exponent of 4.  Domain of applicability  = Stress ratio = Higher mean stress is known to increase the rate of crack growth and is known as the mean stress effect. The mean stress of a cycle is expressed in terms of the stress ratio R which is defined as :R = {K_{\\\\text{min}} \\\\over K_{\\\\text{max}}}, or ratio of minimum to maximum stress intensity factors. In the linear elastic fracture regime, R is also equivalent to the load ratio :R \\\\equiv {P_{\\\\text{min}} \\\\over P_{\\\\text{max}}}. The Paris‚ÄìErdogan equation does not explicitly include the effect of stress ratio, although equation coefficients can be chosen for a specific stress ratio. Other crack growth equations such as the Forman equation do explicitly include the effect of stress ratio, as does the Elber equation by modelling the effect using crack closure. = Intermediate stress intensity range = The Paris‚ÄìErdogan equation holds over the mid-range of growth rate regime as shown in the figure 1, but does not apply for very low values of \\\\Delta Kapproaching the threshold value \\\\Delta K_{\\\\text{th}}, or for very high values approaching the material's fracture toughness, K_{\\\\text{Ic}}. The alternating stress intensity at the critical limit is given by \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta K_{\\\\text{cr}} &= (1-R)K_{\\\\text{Ic}} \\\\end{align}as shown in the figure 1. The slope of the crack growth rate curve on log-log scale denotes the value of the exponent m and is typically found to lie between 2 and 4, although for materials with low static fracture toughness such as high- strength steels, the value of m can be as high as 10. = Long cracks = Because the size of the plastic zone (r_{\\\\text{p}} \\\\approx K_{I}^2/\\\\sigma_{y}^2) is small in comparison to the crack length, a (here, \\\\sigma_{y} is yield stress), small-scale yielding applies, enabling the use of linear elastic fracture mechanics and the stress intensity factor. Thus, the Paris‚ÄìErdogan equation is also only valid in the linear elastic fracture regime, under tensile loading and for long cracks.

In spite of social and legal barriers, he directly challenged three major barriers against Asians in the United States: citizenship, joining a profession, and owning land. Biography Yamashita was born in Yawatahama, Ehime, Shikoku, Japan. He immigrated to the United States in the 1890s and, aided by a photographic memory, graduated from Tacoma High School in two years before entering University of Washington law school's second graduating class. Yamashita graduated with a law degree from the University of Washington in 1902 and passed the state bar exam with distinction. The Washington State Supreme Court, in processing his bar application, issued an order expressing \\"doubt whether a native of Japan is entitled under naturalization laws to admission to citizenship.\\" Yamashita appealed the order, representing himself before the Washington Supreme Court. Despite Yamashita's 28-page brief having been described as being of \\"solid professional quality\\" and containing legal strategies that are \\"quite original,\\" the Supreme Court's unanimous decision was that he was not eligible to be an American, and therefore could not practice law. This decision was overturned, posthumously, nearly 100 years later on March 1, 2001. In 1922, Yamashita again entered legal waters when he appealed an alien land law prohibiting Asians from owning property. Washington's attorney general maintained that in order for Japanese people to fit in, their \\"marked physical characteristics\\" would have to be destroyed, that \\"the Negro, the Indian and the Chinaman\\" had already demonstrated assimilation was not possible for them. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case Takuji Yamashita v. Hinkle, but affirmed the prohibition. Washington's Alien Land Law would not be repealed until 1966. Afterwards, Yamashita managed restaurants and hotels in Seattle and Bremerton and an oyster business in Silverdale. During World War II, Yamashita and his wife were interned, losing virtually everything they owned. With his family, he was incarcerated at Tule Lake, Manzanar, and Minidoka before returning to Seattle. In 1957, Yamashita returned to Japan where he died less than two years later.

Hattendorf, ed., \\"Benbow's Last Fight: Documents relating to the Battle of Cape Santa Marta, 19-24 August 1702,\\" in N.A.M. Rodger, ed., Naval Miscellany, vol. 5. Publications of the Navy Records Society, vol. 125. (London: Naval Records Society, 1984),pp. 143-206. Benbow vigorously attacked the French squadron, but the refusal of most of his captains to support the action allowed du Casse to escape. Benbow lost a leg during the engagement and died of illness about two months later. Two of the captains were convicted of cowardice and shot. Benbow's resolution to pursue the French, in what proved to be his last fight, proved irresistible to the public imagination. The events of the fight inspired a number of ballads, usually entitled Admiral Benbow or Brave Benbow, which were still favourites among British sailors more than a century later. Prelude Upon the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, Benbow was sent to the West Indies with a small squadron, with the intention of keeping the Spanish possessions there out of the hands of the French. Du Casse was dispatched to Cartagena with a squadron to compel its allegiance to Philip V. Benbow set out to intercept them. Course of battle On 19 August 1702, Benbow's squadron encountered the French along the coast of Colombia, off Santa Marta, a little to the east of the mouth of the Rio Magdalena. He ordered his squadron to engage, but Defiance and Windsor being astern and showing no great haste, they had to be ordered to make more sail. Benbow intended to wait for Defiance to come up; but Falmouth opened the engagement by attacking the frigate, and Windsor a ship abreast of her, at four o'clock. Breda joined in, but Defiance and Windsor broke off after a few broadsides and left the Breda under fire from the French, the battle continuing until nightfall. Breda and Ruby pursued the French all night, while the rest of the squadron straggled. Pursuit continued through the 20th, with the Breda and Ruby firing chase-guns as they could. Engaging again on the morning of the 21st, Ruby was badly damaged; Defiance and Windsor refused action, though abreast of the last French ship. The Greenwich had now fallen five leagues astern. On the 22nd, Breda captured the galley Anne, originally an English ship captured by the French, and the damaged Ruby was ordered to return to Port Royal. During the night of the 24th, Benbow engaged one of the enemy ships alone and had his right leg wrecked by a chain shot, returning to the quarter-deck as soon as it could be dressed. Flag-Captain Fogg ordered the other captains of the squadron to keep the line of battle; in response, Captain Kirkby of Defiance came aboard and told Benbow, \\"You had better desist, the French are very strong.\\" Finding the other captains largely of the same opinion, Benbow broke off and returned to Jamaica. Aftermath Benbow received a letter from Jean du Casse after the engagement: > Sir, > I had little hopes on Monday last but to have supped in your cabin: but it > pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those > cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them, for by God they deserve it. > Yours, > Du Casse Such was indeed his course: Benbow held courts-martial upon his captains upon their return. Captains Kirkby and Wade were found guilty of cowardice and sentenced to be shot; Wade was said to have been drunk throughout the engagement. Captain Constable was cleared of the charge of cowardice, but was convicted on other charges and cashiered. Captain Hudson died before he could be tried. Captains Fogg and Vincent were charged with having signed a paper with the other captains of the squadron, stating they would not fight, but they represented this as a device to keep Captain Kirkby from deserting; Benbow testifying in their favour, they were merely suspended. Benbow's leg was amputated; but a fever developed, doubtless abetted by the low conduct of his captains, and he died on 4 November 1702. Kirkby, Wade, and Constable were sent to Plymouth aboard HMS Bristol, where their sentences were confirmed by the Lord High Admiral. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard Bristol on 16 April 1703. Fogg and Vincent were permitted to return to the service.

In late 1939 he joined the Merchant Navy as a compromise between military call-up and his distaste for war. He served on a freighter bringing potatoes from Jersey to Southampton, but overstayed his time ashore on the island, missed his boat, and was caught there when the Channel Islands were occupied by the German Army in July 1940. He obtained temporary farm work as a potato picker, but also began stealing from empty properties, resulting in arrest and prosecution in the Magistrate's Court. He was deported by the German occupying authorities, first to Fort d'Hauteville prison near Dijon, France, and eventually to an internment camp in Kreuzburg, Germany. In Germany, Pleasants chose to join the Waffen SS, and became an SS-Sch√ºtze in the British Free Corps which in 1944 became a foreign legion of the Waffen-SS. He claimed to have been invited to join the German broadcasting service from Berlin to Allied and neutral countries, and, in this connection, to have met William Joyce and John Amery, and to have discussed with them the possibilities of charges of treason. He claimed also to have had a sexual relationship with Joyce's wife, Eileen. In August 1944 he demanded to be returned to his camp. He was stripped of his uniform and summarily despatched to an SS punishment camp at Bandekow near Schwerin, where he worked in a road- making gang,Weale, Adrian (2014-11-12).

Known primarily for his work as a pedal steel guitarist with Neil Young, Keith was a fixture of the Nashville country music community in the 1950s and 1960s before working with numerous successful rock, country and pop artists as both a producer and versatile, multi-instrumentalist sideman for over four decades. Neil Young affectionately referred to him as \\"Long Grain\\" (a joking word play reference to a variety of the famous Uncle Ben‚Äôs Rice, and Ben‚Äôs height). Keith was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014. Biography Born in Fort Riley, Kansas, Keith later relocated to Bowling Green, Kentucky before working as a session musician in Nashville. Keith's first big recording in Nashville was playing on Patsy Cline's 1961 hit \\"I Fall to Pieces\\". Keith first worked with Neil Young in 1971 on Young's Harvest album, having been introduced by Elliot Mazer, the album's producer, who was looking for a session player in Nashville on short notice. This spawned a collaboration that would last nearly 40 years, as Keith went on to play with Young on over a dozen albums and numerous tours. Keith also played the role of Grandpa Green in the Neil Young feature-length movie Greendale, a film accompaniment released on DVD to Young's 2003 album of the same name. In addition to his work with Young, Keith also worked with Terry Reid, Todd Rundgren, Lonnie Mack, The Band, Blue, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Paul Butterfield, J. J. Cale, Linda Ronstadt, Warren Zevon, Ian and Sylvia, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray and Ringo Starr. He also served as the producer of Jewel's debut album Pieces of You, and worked as solo artist. He toured with Crosby Stills Nash & Young on their 2006 Freedom of Speech Tour.

It was released by Discovery Games in 1977 and re-released by Avalon Hill in 1979. The inventors released a 25th anniversary edition of the game in 2003. Description Set in the 19th century, the object of the game is to explore the interior of Africa, make an important discovery, and report it back to European civilization. The explorers must outfit their expeditions and choose a method of travel, be it canoe, camel or foot. At the outset of the game the map of the interior of Africa is blank. As explorers enter each unexplored hex, a card is drawn to determine the terrain and events, if any, that befall the explorers. Crayons are used to draw terrain on the map as it is discovered. The explorers must confront dangers such as starvation, disease, river cataracts and hostile natives. The game is, in fact, highly lethal to explorers, but if a player loses an explorer he or she may create a new one who re-enters the game at a coastal port. The player must choose a profession, and the number of points a player gains for particular discoveries will vary depending on their choice. In particular: *Zoologists get points for discovering animals. *Botanists get points for discovering exotic plants. *Missionaries get more points when dealing with natives. *Geologists gain points for minerals. *Doctors gain points for medicinal items. *Journalists gain points for almost any encounter, even with other players. *Ethnologists gain points for discovering native villages Reception In the November 1978 edition of Dragon (Issue 20), Gary Gygax called it a complex but \\"most enjoyable game\\".

Its mission is to advance the interests of members by creating sustainable biodiesel industry growth. NBB works to remove barriers to the industry and educate the public about biodiesel. It offers regulatory, technical, communications, education, and petroleum outreach programs. Biodiesel is a fuel composed of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, designated B100, and meeting the requirements of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM International) D6751. Membership NBB promotes the common business interests of those seeking to advance the use of biodiesel as a fuel or fuel additive that meets ASTM standards. Members are state, national, and international feedstock and feedstock processor organizations, biodiesel suppliers, fuel marketers and distributors, and technology providers. Structure The governing board is made up of 15 directors elected by voting members. Seven of the directors are elected by weighted votes. The remaining eight are elected by straight votes ‚Äì two are feedstock producer organization voting delegates who are actively engaged in farming; two are voting delegates of producer or marketer members who are members of either the National Renderer‚Äôs Association or the Fats and Proteins Research Foundation (FPRF); and four are voting delegates of producer or marketer members and/or feedstock producer members who are not members of the National Renderer‚Äôs Association or FPRF. History NBB was founded in 1992 by state soybean commodity groups. Originally known as the National Soy Diesel Development Board, it was created by farmers who saw a real potential for biodiesel made from soybean oil. (Soybean oil is a byproduct of harvesting and processing soybeans for protein, for both human and animal consumption.) The commodity groups funded important biodiesel research and development programs focusing on soybean oil as the primary feedstock source for biodiesel. Feedstock is whatever the main ingredient of a biodiesel is. While the majority of today's biodiesel is still made from soybean oil, over the years, new feedstocks have emerged. Today, feedstocks range from camelina, cottonseed, and canola oil to restaurant trap grease, recycled cooking oil and beef tallow. Additional research may someday develop algae and other high-oil sources into commercially viable options. Consequently, NBB has evolved into a feedstock-neutral industry association ‚Äì a move voted for by the organization‚Äôs farmer members. Access to economical feedstock sources remains a focal point for the industry, and NBB continues to be a strong advocate in Washington, D.C. for increased investment in feedstock research. Advocacy Although its headquarters are located in Jefferson City, Missouri, NBB has a federal affairs office in Washington, D.C. This advocacy arm of the organization engages in critical federal policy efforts on behalf of the industry, such as the biodiesel tax incentive and Renewable Fuels Standard, which requires modest amounts of biomass-based diesel to be blended into the nation‚Äôs diesel supply. NBB‚Äôs regulatory team monitors and analyzes both the regulatory and legislative landscapes of the biodiesel industry ‚Äì identifying barriers and opportunities to expand the use of biodiesel. The state regulatory team tracks an average of 300 pieces of legislation nationwide. The team provides access to bills through a members-only website and updates members with regular communications summarizing current events, specific legislation, passed legislation, new incentives, and regulatory developments. Key areas of support =Fuel quality= Ensuring consumers have a high level of confidence in the biodiesel they purchase is a top priority for NBB and a key element in the industry's growth. Regulation of fuel standards is a function primarily left to the states, but regulation of biodiesel is not uniform across all states. NBB works with states on fuel quality enforcement measures. NBB also catalogs information regarding their authority to regulate fuels; their status in adopting ASTM D6751 as the fuel specification for biodiesel; enforcement procedures; and assessment of capacity to analyze samples. The National Biodiesel Accreditation Program is a cooperative and voluntary program for the accreditation of producers and marketers of biodiesel fuel called BQ-9000. The program is a unique combination of the ASTM standard for biodiesel, ASTM D6751, and a quality systems program, which includes storage, sampling, testing, blending, shipping, distribution, and fuel management practices. BQ-9000 is open to any biodiesel manufacturer, marketer, or distributor of biodiesel and biodiesel blends in the U.S. and Canada. Companies must pass a rigorous review and inspection of their quality control processes by an independent auditor. The National Biodiesel Accreditation Commission (NBAC) issues a ‚ÄúBQ-9000 producer‚Äù or ‚ÄúBQ-9000 Marketer‚Äù seal of approval for those who pass.\\"Intertek Biodiesel Laboratory Awarded BQ-9000(R) Certification by the National Biodiesel Accreditation Commission\\" (2013-05-08), Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com), retrieved 2014-05-27. =Sustainability= NBB is committed to sustainability ‚Äì meeting today's needs for environmental stewardship, economic prosperity, and quality of life without compromising future generations' ability to meet these needs for themselves. NBB believes biodiesel demonstrates environmental stewardship across its lifecycle by maximizing net energy balance and minimizing negative impacts on natural ecosystems, creating green jobs, and enhancing quality of life. NBB membership adopted the following sustainability principles to guide the industry:\\"National Biodiesel Board Unveils Guiding Principles for Sustainability\\" (2009, Feb 3), GreenFleet (www.greenfleetmagazine.com), retrieved 2014-05-27. *Biodiesel production shall follow all applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which it is produced. *Biodiesel projects shall be developed and operated under appropriate, transparent, and participatory processes that involve all relevant stakeholders. *Biodiesel shall contribute to climate change mitigation by significantly reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels. Producers shall strive to continuously improve that reduction. *Biodiesel production shall support human rights and labor rights, and shall ensure safe and decent working conditions. *Biodiesel production shall contribute to the social and economic development of local communities. *Biodiesel production shall strive to improve food security. *Throughout the supply chain, the biodiesel industry shall implement management systems that maintain and strive to improve biodiversity, areas of High Conservation Value, and the quality of natural resources such as soil, air, and water. *Biodiesel production shall respect natural resource rights, such as land and water rights. *All participants throughout biodiesel supply chain shall be dedicated to the ideal of continuous improvement. Members shall, through ongoing efforts, make advancements in the economic, social and environmental performance of the industry. =Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) advancement= NBB developed an OEM education and outreach program to foster OEM understanding, technical research, acceptance and promotion of biodiesel. All diesel engine manufacturing companies warrant the engines they make for ‚Äúmaterials and workmanship.‚Äù While most companies recommend a particular type of fuel in the owner's manual, engine manufacturers do not warrant fuel, including regular diesel. Many companies have stated formally that the use of blends up to B20 (20 percent biodiesel, 80 percent diesel) will not void their parts and workmanship warranties. Official statements from the engine companies are available on the NBB website . All U.S. OEMs approve of at least B5, and more than 54 percent support B20 or higher blends in at least some of their models. Driven by new engine emissions requirements, which take effect on January 1, 2010, many engine manufacturers have completely redesigned their diesel engines for compliance. Annual conference Each February, NBB holds its annual National Biodiesel Conference & Expo.National Biodiesel Conference & Expo, www.biodieselconference.org, retrieved 2014-05-27. The event provides educational tracks for all biodiesel stakeholders ‚Äì state, national, and international feedstock and feedstock processor organizations, biodiesel suppliers, fuel marketers and distributors, and technology providers ‚Äì as well as networking opportunities, industry updates, and access to government leaders. The conference has been going green for many years with the help of zero waste event producers The Spitfire Agency. The National Biodiesel Foundation The National Biodiesel Foundation (NBF) was organized in 1994 to support and promote outreach, education, science, and demonstration activities for the advancement of biodiesel and its co-products to improve national security, air quality, and the environment. Project funding is provided through government grants, charitable organizations, and corporate and individual donations. Headquarters The NBB is headquartered in Jefferson City, Missouri in a ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù building, which was renovated from the ground up with eco-conscious features. These include carpet made from recycled materials, high efficiency plumbing and appliances, skylights, automated office lights, non-toxic paint, and solar-powered parking lot lights. The building also has many green technological capabilities, such as worldwide videoconferencing, which reduces the need for travel.

The entrance to Idora Park, c. 1910 Idora Park (1899‚Äì1984) was a northeastern Ohio amusement park popularly known as \\"Youngstown's Million Dollar Playground.\\" Built by the Youngstown Park and Falls Street Railway Company, the park's expansion coincided with the growth of the South Side of Youngstown, Ohio, in the Fosterville neighborhood. Prior to its closure in the wake of a devastating fire, Idora Park was one of the nation's few remaining urban amusement parks. Opening and early development The park opened as Terminal Park on May 30, 1899, which was Decoration Day (now known as Memorial Day). At that time in America, it was common for amusement parks called trolley parks to sprout at the end of trolley lines to generate weekend revenue. Without an admission fee, anyone who could afford the trolley fare could enter the park. This trolley park's first season presented its guests a bandstand, theater, dance pavilion, a roller coaster, a circle swing, and concession stands. It was later renamed Idora Park. When a bridge spanning the Mahoning River opened on Youngstown's Market Street on May 23, 1899, the entire South Side was unrolled for development. The trolley line linking the downtown to Idora Park ran south on Market, west on Warren, south on Hillman Street, Sherwood west to Glenwood Avenue, then cruised through Parkview Avenue (west) into the Idora terminal. Major attractions =Roller coasters= One of the park's many attractions was a wooden roller coaster with a length of and the height of 85 feet high was called the Wild Cat, which opened in 1930. The state-of-the-art, three-minute ride was hailed by roller coaster connoisseurs across the country. The Wild Cat was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck, who held 100 patents for roller coaster innovations. In 1984, the Wild Cat was still ranked among the top ten roller coasters in the world. Another famous attraction to the park was the Jack Rabbit, a wooden roller coaster built in 1910 by TM Harden. It was tall and long, had a ride time of two minutes and thirty seconds, and was lengthened and recountered in the 1930s. In an attempt to bring people back to the park for the 1984 season, park owners reversed the trains of the Jack Rabbit and renamed it the Back Wabbit. =Kiddieland= The Kiddieland area was originally a giant concrete swimming pool. When the park was built, it included the pool and a large bath house. A large hole was drilled into the pool to connect to an underground saltwater spring, creating the only saltwater pool in the country. To address the park's space concerns, the pool was replaced with a children's rides section during the 1950s. The bath house became a shelter and storage area. The Kiddieland area included smaller and slower rides for children, some of which were touted as miniature versions of Idora Park's rides, such as the open-air children's version of the Idora Special train. A small wooden roller coaster was considered a children's version of one of the featured large-scale rollercoasters. Other attractions included an open air, roofed picnic table area (where attendees could serve food they brought from outside the park) and an old-fashioned automobile pathway which had a self-guiding track but allowed for a minor amount of steering so that even children could feel they were actually driving these low-powered gasoline vehicles. Children's midway games were also present. =Ballroom= The Idora Park Ballroom opened June 30, 1910. The open-air ballroom was based on one in Coney Island, New York. It was billed as the largest dance floor between New York City and Chicago. The hardwood-floored ballroom eventually became enclosed to allow for year-round use. Idora Park's house band played in the ballroom until the advent of radio in the 1930s. Radio increased the level of listener sophistication, and Idora Park soon began to hire to big-name bands. Subsequent decades brought glorious entertainment to the ballroom: dances, concerts, New Year's parties, and Presidential campaign visits from John F. Kennedy. High-profile musical acts that played the ballroom included: the Glenn Miller Orchestra, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, the Eagles, Ray Charles, Maynard Ferguson, Blue √ñyster Cult and The Monkees. Other attractions Additional attractions and features of Idora Park included Kooky Castle, a haunted house; Laffin Lena's, a funhouse (which featured a hall of mirrors); Old Saw Mill, a water boat ride; Tilt-O- Whirl; the Scrambler; the Caterpillar; the Orbit prior to the Scrambler; bumper-cars; a Ferris Wheel; a small passenger train (Idora Express) which traveled through the park; and a spinning ride (The Rockets) with three bus- sized stainless steel open-air rocket ships which were attached by thick cables. The base of the rocket ride were refreshments and cotton candy. Adjacent to the rocket ride was a french fry stand which was one of the most popular and famous items sold at Idora Park. Midway games, including a shooting gallery and a penny arcade, were present in several locations of the park along with a miniature golf course. Decline Idora Park thrived through the decades, yet it also faced continual competition from larger state and national amusement parks. Landlocked on its , Idora had no options for expansion. As the automobile became the preferred mode of transportation, trolley lines died out, and so did many trolley parks. The primary reason Idora had survived was it had become the preferred location for ethnic, church, and company picnics. Youngstown Sheet and Tube, one of the largest employers in the Mahoning Valley, announced the closure of one of its largest mills on September 19, 1977. The overnight loss of nearly 5,000 jobs greatly impacted the Youngstown region's economy and Idora Park directly. During the hardship the community was suffering, Idora Park still boasted existing rides. The Idora Park Merry-Go-Round was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. In 1976, Idora Park was named one of the nation's 100 best amusement parks in Gary Kyriazi's book, Great American Amusement Parks. By 1980, the Wild Cat and Jack Rabbit were recognized in publications as some of the best coasters in the country. Nonetheless, by the early 1980s, the park was a relic that also housed relics: it now housed rides from other parks, such as Euclid Beach Park in Cleveland and West View Park outside of Pittsburgh, that met their end in the 1960s and '70s. =1984 fire= A devastating fire on April 26, 1984 destroyed the Wild Cat roller coaster, the Lost River ride, eleven concession stands, and the park office. Employees scrambled to save park records, but only some of the most current files were pulled to safety, while older files and historical records were lost. Employees tried to extinguish the growing flames with hand extinguishers, but soon realized that the fire was out of control. Twelve fire companies responded to the fire, which spread quickly as winds carried it across concession stands and on to the midway. Many off-duty firefighters also responded to the call to help contain flames that spread along the Wild Cats wooden tracks and threatened the merry-go-round, which was scorched but ultimately saved from destruction.The Youngstown Fire Department prevented it from catching fire by continually pouring water on the roof of the octagonal building. Firefighters found themselves at a disadvantage with a lack of in- park hydrants, poor water pressure, and aged wooden rides and buildings. They finally tamed the blaze by running lines to hydrants outside the park. Final damage was estimated in millions of dollars. Intense heat melted paint in various areas of the gazebo. The south horseshoe of the Wild Cat was destroyed, and the repair cost was prohibitive. The park operated through the summer of 1984, but with the premier ride gone, a decision was made to close permanently. Idora Park welcomed its last visitors on September 16, 1984. On October 20‚Äì21, 1984, an auction was conducted by Norton Auctioneers of Coldwater, Michigan to dispose of the rides and equipment. The remaining coasters (Wild Cat, Jack Rabbit, Baby Wild Cat), and many other buildings (Ballroom, Kiddieland complex, French Fry stand) were abandoned. New ownership In 1985, Mt. Calvary Pentecostal Church in Youngstown bought the Idora property and announced plans for a religious complex, to be named the \\"City of God\\". The Ballroom remained open for various events until Memorial Day 1986. The church lost access to the property in 1989 after accumulating more than $500,000 in debt on the land. =Deterioration= In an interview with the Youngstown Vindicator on October 16, 1984, former Idora Park owner Max Rindin was asked what would happen to the Park after it closed. ‚ÄúIn time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll all be torched.‚Äù Gradually, his prophecy came true. Another fire at the abandoned park on May 3, 1986, destroyed the Heidelberg Gardens, Kooky Castle (haunted house), Laffin Lena's (fun house), and the Helter Skelter bumper car buildings. But until that fire, there was always a tangible reminder of Idora Park. Over time, Mt. Calvary failed to build their religious complex, the property decayed, and it was not secured from trespassers. The former Idora Park's remaining structures were eventually vandalized, destroyed by natural elements, or succumbed to arson. =Calls for preservation= By 1999, Conneaut Lake Park Management Group (which had taken over Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania; about from Idora Park), attempted to negotiate the purchase of either the Jack Rabbit or Wild Cat from the property owners. Blueprints for both rides were still available, so they could be refurbished at Conneaut. The group also planned to purchase the complete merry-go-round from the owners in New York. These plans never materialized. The ballroom, Jack Rabbit, and Wild Cat remained unpreserved on the property. =2001 fire= On March 5, 2001, the final chapter to Idora Park's history was written when the Ballroom burned down. The fire reportedly started in the basement and was suspicious in nature. The Jack Rabbit and other remaining wooden structures were not destroyed by this fire. Days after the fire, an interview with the property owners stated that they \\"offered to allow (preservation groups) to take the roller coasters down as long as they funded it and had proper insurance and bonding\\". However, on July 26, 2001, the Wild Cat, Jack Rabbit, and all other decaying structures (all unsalvageable) were demolished by bulldozers to prevent any future fires. City officials had asked that the coasters be removed since they were hazardous to the public. Both the Jack Rabbit and Wild Cat were listed on the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) preservation list. Inaction by the park property owners to preserve these remaining Idora Park historic structures ultimately led to their destruction. In a 2001 news conference following the Ballroom's messy asbestos cleanup, Mt. Calvary Pentecostal Church restated that: \\"This future complex (City of God) will only help the entire community but especially youth... hopes to break ground no later than next spring (2002). The entire project should take at least two years to complete.\\" As of May 3, 2013, Mt. Calvary Pentecostal Church has yet to break ground on the \\"City of God\\" project. Future development possibilities Although the property still belongs to Mt. Calvary Pentecostal Church, the land is vacant of buildings, and City of God project was never realized. \\"The Mahoning County Common Pleas Court dismissed the delinquent tax case against the owners of the former Idora Park....\\" The case was dismissed because one of the parties named in the suit, Teen Missions International, Inc. of Merritt Island, Florida, paid the delinquent taxes on behalf of Mt. Calvary Church. Teen Missions International helps churches and other religious organizations with financing different projects. Teen Missions has loaned nearly $1.2 million to Mount Calvary over a period of time to help develop the Idora property. Mt. Calvary Church subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy by February 2017, with the majority of the outstanding debt being related to the delinquent taxes on the Idora Park property. The Youngstown 2010 redevelopment and city revitalization plans have also stated their interest in acquiring the property to utilize it as a green space extension of nearby Mill Creek Park. These plans are on hold until the city can obtain the property from the Church (possibly through eminent domain), or alternative ownership acquires the property from the Church's outstanding $1.5 million lawsuit. In April 2014, Jim and Toni Amey of nearby Canfield, Ohio, owners of many Idora Park artifacts, opened a museum next to their house called The Idora Park Experience, showcasing many of the artifacts. The museum opens approximately twice a year, and also sells commemorative items related to the park. Following the Mt. Calvary Church's bankruptcy filing, the owners of the museum told the bankruptcy court that they planned on making a bid for the property, valued at $52,000. Despite offering more money than the property was worth, Mt. Calvary Church refused to sell the property, though the couple hoped that bankruptcy court would force a sale by public auction.

George Louis Eyser (August 31, 1870 - March 6, 1919) was a German-American gymnast who competed in the 1904 Summer Olympics, earning six medals in one day, including three gold and two silver medals. Eyser competed with a wooden prosthesis for a left leg, having lost his leg after being run over by a train. Despite his disability, he won gold in the vault, an event which then included a jump over a long horse without aid of a springboard. Life Eyser was born on August 31, 1870 in Kiel, Germany as the only child of Georg Sophus Jasper E√øser and Auguste Friederike Henriette E√øser (n√©e Marxen). When he was 14, his family emigrated to the United States (Eyser obtained US citizenship in 1894). The family first lived in Denver, Colorado, but George moved to St. Louis, Missouri sometime around 1902-1903 where he worked as a bookkeeper for a construction company. There, he joined a local gymnastics club Concordia Turnverein Saint Louis. At some point in his youth, he lost most of his left leg, which had to be amputated after a train ran over it. It was replaced by a wooden prosthesis which allowed physical activities such as running and jumping. A keen sportsman, Eyser pursued training, aiming for the 1904 Olympics. =Olympic career= The 1904 Olympics, held in St. Louis, were the third Olympics and the first ones where gold, silver and bronze medals were introduced for the first three places. Cups or trophies were given to the winners at the previous games. The 1904 games in general had a confusing program of events, which were spread out over several months, and the gymnastics competition was no different. There were two sets of gymnastic events: International Turners' Championship, which was held on July 1‚Äì2 and comprised the all-around, triathlon, and team events, and Olympic Gymnastics Championships, held on October 29, which comprised seven individual apparatus events and the combined event. The individual all-around was a combination of the gymnastic triathlon competition and the athletics triathlon. The team competition was a combination of individual scores from the individual all-around. The parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, and pommel horse scores for each gymnast were summed to get the \\"combined\\" score. Eyser competed in both sets and did poorly in the first one. He was placed 10th in gymnastic 9-event all-around competition, which included 3 routines on both the horizontal bar and parallel bars, two on pommel horse and one on vault. Eyser was 71st in another gymnastic all-around event, which included the same devices, but smaller number of routines. He also competed in the athletics triathlon, but finished the last with the results of 8 m (26.1 ft) in shot put, 15.4 s in 100 meters sprint and 4 m (13 ft) in the long jump. Eyser performed much better in the second competition set. On a single day of October 29, he won 6 medals in total, of which 3 were gold (parallel bars, long horse vault, and 25-foot rope climbing), two silver (pommel horse and 4-event all-around), and one bronze (horizontal bar). His main rival was another American, Anton Heida, who also won 6 medals, 5 gold and one silver. Heida shared gold with Eyser in the vault, was second after Eyser on parallel bars, but won the horizontal bar, pommel horse, all-around and team competitions. In the team competition, which was then held by the clubs, Concordia finished fourth. Prior to 2008, Eyser was the only person with an artificial leg to have competed at the Olympic Games. Later, in 2008 Natalie du Toit,a South African swimmer who lost her left leg in a traffic accident, participated in the 10 km swimming marathon at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and finished 16th., and in 2012 Oscar Pistorius, a South African double-leg amputee runner, participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in the 400-metre race and the 4x400 relay. =Later life= After his Olympic success, Eyser continued competing for Concordia, with the club winning the 1908 international meet in Frankfurt, Germany, and the 1909 national meet in Cincinnati, Ohio. He died on March 6, 1919 in Denver, CO.

The train is stopped when a landslide blocks the line on the second night out from Istanbul, and American millionaire Samuel Edward Ratchett is found stabbed to death the next morning.

In 1366 Thomas Fraser, a descendant of Sir Alexander Fraser of Cornton brother of Sir Richard Fraser of Touch-Fraser, exchanged the lands in Petyndreich, Stirlingshire for those of Kinmundy, Aberdeenshire. His grandson Thomas exchanged the estate of Cornton for Stonywood and Muchalls in Aberdeenshire. It was presumably Thomas who erected the towerhouse stronghold overlooking the North Sea, which is now known as Muchalls Castle, having undergone expansion by the Burnetts of Leys in 1617. His descendant, Andrew Fraser, who was created Lord Fraser in 1633, completed Castle Fraser in 1636.

Education Born in Wellington, McLeod graduated BMus (Hons) from Victoria University in 1964, and the same year a New Zealand government bursary enabled her to study for two years in Europe with Messiaen, Stockhausen and Berio. In 1967 she became a lecturer in music at Victoria University, and Professor in 1971, a position she held until 1976. Professorship During her professorship, she was influenced by Guru Maharaji's Divine Light Mission, which led to her early retirement.Julie Anne Sadie, Rhian Samuel, The Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers, W. W. Norton & Company, 1995. In the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, McLeod was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music. She is best known for two major works, Earth and Sky and Under the Sun for large forces. She has also composed many songs and hymns. She is a great admirer of, and was greatly influenced by the music of Messiaen. Her Seven Tone Clock Pieces were first performed by the New Zealand pianist Jeffrey Grice 1. She lives in Pukerua Bay, Porirua, where she continues to work on music theory, especially the relationships between notes and scales. Tone-Clock Theory In the mid-1980s, McLeod encountered the work of Dutch composer Peter Schat, who had developed a post-tonal compositional technique called the Tone Clock. This technique emphasised the role on forming the chromatic aggregate through the transposition and inversion of three-note chords (trichords). McLeod expanded this technique to encompass all 223 possible set-classes (to use the terminology of Allan Forte's pitch-class set theory), and also developed an exceptionally coherent labelling, categorisation and analytical approach to the chromatic universe. Her unpublished manuscript Tone Clock Theory Expanded: Chromatic Maps I & II explains the theoretical and philosophical basis behind her theory, and includes a rigorous listing of all set-classes (called Intervallic Prime Forms) with details notes and observations on their properties. Works =Earth and Sky= Earth and Sky is a large work for choirs and orchestra, mainly of children. It tells the story of the MƒÅori myth of creation, notably the separation of the Earth Mother, Papa-T≈´-ƒÅ-Nuku from the Sky Father, Ranginui. It uses many passages involving voices moving independently. It was first performed in Masterton in 1968, and was performed in Tauranga in 1970. In spite of its few performances, it is regarded as a landmark in New Zealand music, by reason of its large scale, local content and experimental nature. A Royal Command Performance was recorded at Mercury Theatre in Auckland in 1971. =Under the Sun= Under the Sun was commissioned by the city of Palmerston North (Manawatu, New Zealand) to commemorate its centenary. It was performed six times there on the week of 24‚Äì30 May 1971. It tells the history of the Sun, from the formation of the earth through the entire span of life on earth till the Sun cools.

It is scored for four orchestras in each corner of the auditorium, a five-member rock group, two adult choirs half-way up both sides of a large open auditorium, and four \\"floor choirs\\" totaling 440 children who act and dance as well as singing. Each has its own conductor, coordinated by listening through headphones to a tape of McLeod herself counting beats and bars. (Another track of the tape carries the narration.) At the end of act four, bringing us to the present (in the hippie era), which features the incorporated Pop Song 'Shadow People' the audience is invited to join in the dancing. The production involved 1000 people and took two years to bring to performance. Children from 16 schools contributed 2000 paintings of which 70 were chosen to be projected on silver screens at each end of the auditorium. The show was produced (US: directed) by Peter Tulloch. A recording of a whole performance was published, as well as a single of the incorporated Act Four song in popular style, Shadow People performed by Grant Bridger and the local three-piece group, 'The Forgiving'. =The Emperor and the Nightingale= Commissioned in 1985 by the Wellington Regional Orchestra (now Orchestra Wellington) for a family concert under Sir William Southgate, as part of the 1986 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts in Wellington, The Emperor and the Nightingale has subsequently been performed by a number of New Zealand regional and youth orchestras. The version recorded here was revised by the composer in 2010. The text was adapted by the composer from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Nightingale, in the English version found in The Yellow Fairy Book (1894) edited by Andrew Lang (1844‚Äì1912) and translated by Leonora Blanche Alleyne Lang (1851‚Äì1933).McLeod, Jenny (2011), Liner notes for The Emperor and the Nightingale\\". =Rock Concerto= The Rock Concerto began life in 1986 as a (first) Rock Sonata for piano, a work with strong classical roots and in places of Lisztian difficulty, commissioned by the New Zealand pianist Bruce Greenfield for his gifted virtuoso pupil the seventeen-year-old Eugene Albulescu. (Partly on the strength of this score, the composer was invited in 1987 as an international guest composer to a ten-day contemporary music festival in Kentucky, hosted by the Louisville Orchestra for its fortieth anniversary.) At Albulescu‚Äôs request, in 2009 she scored and revised the rock sonata as a piano concerto which he might also direct from the keyboard. The first two movements are in sonata form, each complete with first subject, transition theme, and contrasting second group, with a classical-type development section, at the end of which there is also an opportunity for an improvised cadenza (Albulescu‚Äôs idea, and an uncommon feature of his performances‚Äîby his own desire held well in check, however, in the present recording). Though the music is newly composed, and its rhythmic language is very much of our own time (in a popular sense), it is also strongly impelled by the spirit of Beethoven (Mozart, Schubert, Liszt, Debussy, Gershwin‚Ä¶)‚Äîthe \\"distant friends\\" referred to in the first movement Another friend was Charlie French, to whom the second, rather darker movement (scored for solo piano, strings and flute alone) is dedicated. Charlie was an Australian aboriginal activist who shared our home in Wellington for a time and later succumbed, alas, as an early victim of Aids. The headlong last movement is in rondo- sonata form, with a Latino romp as its recurring rondo, a nursery-type second theme, and a development-cum-episode that starts in a quasi-Iberian vein. Each movement has a coda (in the first and last cases quite extended), and each may also be played independently.McLeod, Jenny (2011), Liner notes for Rock Concerto. Songs and hymns Several of Jenny McLeod's songs were written for a \\"Sun Festival\\" in Wellington Harbour in the mid 1980s. Each is based on a different colour.

A boutonni√®re () or Buttonhole is a floral decoration, typically a single flower or bud, worn on the lapel of a tuxedo or suit jacket. While worn frequently in the past, boutonni√®res are now usually reserved for special occasions for which formal wear is standard, such as at proms, homecomings, funerals, and weddings. (Women who wear jackets on these occasions also often may wear \\"buttonholes\\", but more typically a woman would wear a corsage.) Nowadays, a lapel pin is worn more often than flowers on business suits. Traditionally, a boutonni√®re was worn pushed through the lapel buttonhole (on the left, the same side as a pocket handkerchief) and the stem is held in place with a loop at the back of the lapel. The flower's calyx, if pronounced such as those of a carnation, should be fully inserted into the buttonhole which would secure it tightly and flat against the lapel. Thus the buttonhole should ideally be at least 1‚Öõ\\" long for there to be enough room to fit a standard sized flower's calyx. Otherwise, the calyx would not fit into the buttonhole and the flower head would hang freely and move about in the wind. However, on many recently made coats and jackets, the lapel is made without the loop required, which would normally sit on the reverse of the lapel, beneath the buttonhole. Sometimes, the lapel buttonhole is in the \\"keyhole\\" shape, as opposed to the traditional straight cut, or is not even pierced through, in which case the boutonni√®re may be pinned onto the jacket lapel, although this may be considered unsightly and continued pinning could eventually damage the cloth or silk facing.  History  The word Boutonniere derives from the french word; \\"Buttonhole Flower.\\" Similar to a wedding bouquet, in the 16th century, boutonnieres were used to ward off bad luck and evil spirits. With multiple purposes, It was also used to keep bad scents away and believed to protect against diseases. In the 18th century however, many wore boutonnieres as fashion statements. They were put on the buttonholes of frock coats. In most parts of Europe during this time, it was normal for men to wear fashionable clothes which included not only the boutonniere, but breeches and boots. The French soon began to incorporate this style as well. In the 19th Century, they became part of the Romantic Movement, along with adding fresh color to attire. This was one of the many accessories that a man could add to his clothing similar to picking a pair of well polished shoes. Other accessories were chains, cigar cases, and jeweled pins. In the 20th century, after World War I and II, the act of wearing a flower on the lapel was still alive. Although worn less commonly, they became a way of a person showing honor, elegance, and masculinity. This was due partly to the influence of the cinema. Today, boutonnieres are still very much a part of a man‚Äôs attire, but on special occasions such as weddings, proms, or ceremonies. When worn at prom or weddings, they often match the flowers of the bride or date(corsages). There are many types and styles of boutonniere‚Äôs to choose from. The groom, along with the groom‚Äôs men and the father of the bride all wear a boutonniere, adding a touch of elegance to the important event. At ceremonies, they are used to show honor and nobility to men or women who completed a noble endeavor, accomplishment, or achievement.  Flowers  The flower itself is often a carnation, of which the most formal is white. The classic alternative is one in clove red. Other colours and flowers may also be chosen to better coordinate with whatever else is being worn, such as a blue cornflower. A white gardenia is sometimes seen as a superior alternative to carnations given its scent and beauty. At the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom it is tradition that students wear a carnation boutonni√®re while attending their formal examinations. This boutonni√®re is worn on the lapel of the students sub-fusc, the style of formal academic dress at the University, but is not a compulsory part of the dress. The colour of the carnation indicates which examination the student is taking in that run of exams. At their first examination a white carnation is worn, at subsequent intermediate examination(s) a pink carnation is worn, and at their final examination a red carnation is worn.Halliday, Renee (31 May 2012). \\"Moving to Oxford?

The earliest references to the elm as a \\"hanging tree\\" date from the late 19th century, long after the supposed hangings were said to have taken place. Recent extensive research into the park's history by more than one historian has shown that the tree was on a private farm until the land was bought by the city and added to Washington Square in 1827. No public records exist of hangings from this tree. The only recorded execution in this area was of Rose Butler, in 1820, for arson. She was hanged from a gallows in the city's potter's field, on the eastern side of Minetta Creek, about 500 feet (150 meters) from the elm; at that time, Minetta Creek ran in a shallow ravine between the potter's field and the farm where the elm stood.

Extraction Point is an expansion pack for the psychological survival horror first-person shooter video game F.E.A.R., published by Vivendi Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and developed by TimeGate Studios (rather than Monolith Productions, the developers of F.E.A.R.). It was released in October 2006 for Microsoft Windows and requires the full original game in order to be played. Also, a stand-alone single player demo has been previously released. The expansion was ported to the Xbox 360 and released as part of the F.E.A.R. Files package in November 2007. This expansion owes its name to the game's ultimate goal for the player, to reach the extraction point and leave the city where the adventure takes place. Extraction Point adds new weapons, enemies, and single-player levels, but no new multiplayer content. Additional improvements were also made to the enemy artificial intelligence. The sequel to F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, ignores the events of both expansion packs. Plot Alma in the background The plot of the expansion starts off exactly where the original game left off; while the huge explosion of the \\"Origin Facility\\" has flattened the Auburn district and devastated the city, the helicopter evacuating the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team crash lands in the midst of the chaos. The Point Man is reunited with Delta Force operator Douglas Holiday and F.E.A.R. technical officer Jin Sun-Kwon at the crash site. While trying to regroup, the survivors find the city to be mysteriously empty after the explosion. The Point Man meets Fettel in a nearby church, who notes that the circumstances do not make sense since he had been killed. Angered by his own death, Fettel reactivates the Replica soldiers, who have been dormant since his death, and sends them after the Point Man. Holiday mentions that an extraction point has been established at the roof of Auburn Memorial Hospital, informing the Point Man that he should proceed there as well. Meanwhile, Kwon is captured by Fettel's Replicas, but she is later able to escape while being transported via the subway; from there, she proceeds on her own to Auburn Hospital. The Point Man and Holiday eventually meet up and navigate through the warehouse district of the city, facing great Replica resistance along the way. Eventually Alma, through her apparitions, violently murders Holiday. The Point Man is forced to proceed alone toward and through the subway system, which leads directly to Auburn Hospital. During the Point Man's journey through the winding tunnels, Alma, in her younger form, clears the way for the Point Man multiple times by killing Replica soldiers impeding the Point Man‚Äôs path. Replica forces eventually become desperate and place demolition charges in the subway tunnels with the hope that the resulting explosions will kill the Point Man. While initially unsuccessful, the Point Man is eventually caught in one of these demolition explosions and is ejected from the tunnels onto a nearby parking structure. From here, the Point Man proceeds to the hospital which neighbors the parking structure. Upon reaching the hospital, the Point Man attempts to find and rescue Jin only to find her murdered at the hands of ghostly apparitions. Now, with nothing to fight for but his own survival, the Point Man proceeds to the service elevator. Suddenly, a power outage occurs and the Point Man must find a way to restore it, being taken to the hospital's morgue in the process. While walking around the dark basement, the Point Man witnesses several hallucinations (thought to be the physical form of what is in Alma's mind) which include a series of prison cells, containing the dead ATC victims of Alma's murders in the previous game. Eventually, the Point Man witnesses a hallucination that involves the older and younger Alma reuniting in a blue light. After that hallucination, the Point Man returns to the hospital and notices there's no longer blood on the floor, walls and bathtubs. The elevator is then reactivated and the Point Man is able to make contact with Commisioner Rowdy Betters, who tells him to get to the roof for pickup. Fettel tells the Point Man does not understand the situation and proceeds to unleash a squad of Replica Elites. A UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter proceeds to evacuate him but Fettel, through unknown methods, destroys the helicopter, sending the Point Man into unconsciousness. When he awakens, he staggers to the roof railing, to witness the entire city in flames. The credits roll, ending with Fettel's line from F.E.A.R. \\"A war is coming, I've seen it in my dreams. Fires sweeping over the earth, bodies in the streets, cities turned to dust. Retaliation...\\" =Canonicity= The expansion packs takes place in an alternate universe from the original F.E.A.R., the game's sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, disregards the storylines of both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Only the games developed by Monolith Productions are considered canon. Gameplay Gameplay remains essentially the same as in the original F.E.A.R., though Extraction Point touts some new additions, including 3 new weapons (a minigun, a laser weapon, and a deployable turret), a few new enemies, as well as new locales (though frequently similar to the original game's environments, a common complaint of reviewers). Firefights are still cinematic and usually on a grander scale than in F.E.A.R. - there are frequently a larger number of enemies to deal with and lengthier battles. Another new feature of Extraction Point is the ability to bash open doors by using the melee function, as well as blast them open with explosives. The 'hallucination' sequences are notably more gratuitous and frequent than they were in the first game. In addition, certain supply crates bearing the ATC logo can be bashed open, revealing weapons or health packs. Extraction Point also has higher system requirements than the original F.E.A.R., and users may notice signs of system overload (such as graphical slowdown) if they run Extraction Point using the same minimum performance settings as the original game. Reception Extraction Point received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while F.E.A.R. Files received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Jason Ocampo, writing for GameSpot, praised the atmosphere and gameplay but found the story and replay value lacking.

He received his Bachelor of Laws from Yale Law School in 1957.Joseph P. Fried, \\"Harold Baer Jr., Judge Whose Civil Liberties Decisions Drew Criticism, Dies at 81\\" (obituary), New York Times, May 29, 2014.  Early career  Baer's father, Harold Baer, was a longtime New York Supreme Court justice, born in New York City.Montgomery (Alabama) Junior Chamber of Commerce, Outstanding Young Men of America (1967), available at google books Baer Jr.'s own legal career began as an assistant to the General Counsel of Greater New York Mutual Insurance in 1958. He was then Assistant Counsel to the New York State Commission on the Governmental Operations of the City of New York (1959‚Äì60) and New York State Commission of Investigation (1960‚Äì61). From 1961 to 1967 he was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York. He then served as Executive director, Civilian Complaint Review Board New York City Police Department from 1967 to 1968 before going back to the United States Attorney's office as Chief of the Criminal Division from 1970 to 1972. He was then an adjunct professor at New York Law School from 1974 to 1983.  Judicial career  Baer was elected to serve in the New York Supreme Court for New York County in 1982 and served until 1992. While serving as a state trial judge, he was among the first in the United States to rule that a same-sex couple could be considered a family, so that the surviving member of the couple could benefit from tenant protections under the New York Rental Control laws. Although his decision was reversed by the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals agreed with him in the landmark case of Braschi v. Stahl Associates Co. He was then Executive Judicial Officer for the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc from 1992 to 1994. Federal judicial service He was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 26, 1994, to fill a seat vacated by Judge Robert W. Sweet. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 9 and received his commission the next day. He took senior status on September 8, 2004, serving in that status until his death. Notable cases ; United States v. Bayless Judge Baer found his judicial career in a firestorm in 1996 when he issued an opinion that suppressed evidence in a drug case in the case of United States v. Bayless, 913 F. Supp. 232 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). At the hearing, Judge Baer found that based on the testimony of the junior officer who claimed to have witnessed a drug transaction and the videotaped confession of the defendant, Carolyn Bayless, the police did not have reasonable suspicion sufficient for the arrest. In response to this ruling, two hundred members of Congress wrote to President Bill Clinton demanding that he seek Judge Baer‚Äôs resignation. White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry weighed in with a threatening statement, but later changed course when Second Circuit Judges, led by Chief Judge Jon Newman, excoriated the other two branches of government for their clearly unconstitutional demands and pointed out how the criticism had reached a level that threatened judicial independence. In the end, Judge Baer reversed his ruling following a rehearing during which the government presented a fuller case and the defendant inexplicably took the stand. See US v. Bayless, 921 F. Supp. 211 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Judge Baer was criticized for this decision as well. He wrote about the experience in his book Judges Under Fire: Human Rights, Independent Judiciary, and the Rule of Law (2011). ; Class Action Counsel Diversity For requesting evidence of racial and gender diversity among counsel selected to provide representation in class action lawsuits, Judge Baer has been accused of \\"using his judicial authority to pursue his own personal socio-political agenda.\\"Michael H. Hurwitz, Judge Harold Baer's Quixotic Crusade for Class Counsel Diversity, 17 Cardozo J. Law & Gender 321, 321 (2011). Objectors to a class settlement from 2011 challenged the practice on appeal, but in a summary order the Second Circuit dismissed the issue for lack of standing: \\"Although objectors allege that staffing a case with an eye to diversity 'may interfere with [counsel's] ability to provide the best representation for the class,' they never contend that class counsel's representation was actually inferior.\\" Summary Order at 8-9, Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., No. 11-3696 (2d Cir. Mar. 13, 2013) (ECF No. 649). The case and Judge Baer's class action diversity practice then came before the US Supreme Court, where in denying a petition for writ of certiorari, Justice Samuel Alito, concurring in the denial, nonetheless issued a decision criticizing Judge Baer's practices, for various stated reasons, warning \\"the meaning of the Court's denial of the petition should not be misunderstood.\\" Martin v.

As it is only known from bones, the color of the St. Croix macaw is not known. Extant macaws can generally be grouped in either large or small size clusters, yet the bones of the St. Croix macaw are intermediate in size between the two, and it was slightly larger than the extinct Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor). Only the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis) and Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) are similar in size. It differed from other macaws in various skeletal details, and shared several features only with the genus Ara. Like other macaw species in the Caribbean, the St. Croix macaw is believed to have been driven to extinction by humans, as indicated by the fact that its remains were found in kitchen middens. Taxonomy In 1934, the archeologist Lewis J. Korn (working under the Museum of the American Indian) excavated a kitchen midden (a dump for domestic waste) at a site near Concordia on the southwestern coast of St. Croix, one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea. The midden was located inland from the beach, and its depth was around . Bones of mammals, birds, turtles and fish were obtained from the bottom of the deposit, with bird bones being concentrated at the mid-level. The exact age of the material could not be determined, but since no objects of European origin were found in the deposit, it was assumed to be pre-Columbian, between 500 and 800 years old. 23 species of bird were represented among the well-preserved bones, some of which were extinct. In 1937, the ornithologist Alexander Wetmore identified a number of species among these bones, including a left tibiotarsus (lower leg bone) of an immature macaw, which was unexpected since no such birds were previously known from St. Croix. Specimen of the extinct Cuban macaw, the only other Caribbean species of macaw described based on physical remains Wetmore made the tibiotarsus the holotype specimen of a new macaw species, which he placed in the genus Ara, as Ara autocthones. The specific name is from the Ancient Greek Œ±·ΩêœÑœåœáŒ∏œâŒΩ (autochthon), meaning native or aborigine. The holotype is housed along with the other bones found at the U.S. National Museum of Natural History, where it is cataloged as USNM 483530. Though numerous other now-extinct macaws had been described from the Caribbean based on old accounts alone, the only other species described based on physical remains at the time was the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor), which was known from skins. Though Wetmore conceded that there were many uncertainties surrounding the bone, especially in regard to its affinities to other Caribbean macaws, he thought it appropriate to designate it as a new species. In 1978, the ornithologist Storrs L. Olson (using the spelling autochthones) agreed that the bone belonged to a macaw not assignable to any known species, but noted it may not have been native to St. Croix, since indigenous Caribbeans are known to have kept and traded macaws over long distances. \\"Special Publication 13\\" In 1983, he indicated that if the macaw had indeed been transported, the specific name would be a misnomer. The zoologist Elizabeth S. Wing agreed in 1989 that the macaw could have been traded, but the ornithologists Matthew I. Williams and David W. Steadman stated in 2001 that given the evidence for other macaws having existed in the region, there was no reason why St. Croix could not have had an indigenous species. In 1987, the ornithologist Edgar J. M√°iz L√≥pez found several associated bones of a single bird (cataloged as USNM 44834) at the Hern√°ndez Col√≥n archeological site on the eastern bank of the Cerrillos- Bucan√° river in south central Puerto Rico. The archeological site represents a pre-Columbian Saladoid-Ostionoid village of around 15,000 m2 (3.7 acres) in size, situated on an alluvial terrace. Both cultural and faunal remains were excavated, and the macaw remains were found in a kitchen midden deposit that has been dated to around 300 AD. The specimen consists of partial bones including the left coracoid (missing a portion of the bone's \\"head\\"), both ends of the left humerus, the upper end of the right radius, the left carpometacarpus (missing one metacarpal), the left femur (lacking the lower end), the right tibiotarsus (lacking part of the upper articular surface), upper and lower portions of the left tibiotarsus, as well as unidentified elements. In 2008, Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez assigned the specimen to Ara autocthones (it had been assigned to Ara sp. in 2004, indicating uncertain classification within the genus Ara), as its tibiotarsus is identical in size to the holotype. Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez considered it likely that Ara autocthones was endemic to the West Indian region rather than a species transported from the mainland by Native Americans, as it is far more likely a species restricted to islands would have been driven extinct. Since they found it unlikely the bird occurred naturally on St. Croix, and questioned whether it could even have occurred naturally on Puerto Rico, they considered the name autocthones \\"probably one of the worst possible choices\\" for the species. Though fossils of the parrot genera Amazona and Aratinga have been found in pre-human sites on Puerto Rico, none such belonging to macaws have been found. Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez conceded that macaws are unlikely to be found in cave deposits, and noted that fossils of the Cuban macaw have been found in aquatic deposits. They also pointed out that various animal species were transported and kept in captivity by Native Americans; the Puerto Rican hutia (Isolobodon portoricensis, an extinct rodent) and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi, an extinct flightless rail) were both transported to St. Croix and found in kitchen middens, for example. 1626 painting possibly showing two other extinct Caribbean macaws next to a dodo; a Lesser Antillean macaw (left) and a Martinique macaw (right) Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez pointed out that a coracoid from the island of Montserrat (reported by Williams and Steadman in 2001, and cataloged as UF 4416) could possibly belong to the macaw of St. Croix and Puerto Rico or the Cuban macaw, as it was within the size range of the two (smaller than the former). The ornithologists James W. Wiley and Guy M. Kirwan instead suggested in 2013 that the bone from Montserrat could belong to the extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (A. guadeloupensis) of Guadeloupe. Ara autocthones has been referred to as the St. Croix macaw, but, after more remains were described from Puerto Rico, it has also been called the Puerto Rican macaw. The ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw argued in 2017 that the latter was a more appropriate name, since he found it more plausible that it naturally occurred on Puerto Rico and had been transported to the Virgin Islands. It has been suggested that as many as 13 now-extinct species of macaw have lived on the Caribbean islands, but many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the St. Croix macaw, only two other endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is possibly known from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean, both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to the explorer Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; it is also possible that these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.

While the holotype tibiotarsus appears to belong to a fully grown individual, the fact that the bone is slightly spongy at the ends indicates it was immature. This left tibiotarsus is in total length, in breadth from side to side across the lower end, and the smallest breadth from side to side of the shaft is . Though similar to the same bone in the Cuban macaw, it is wider from side to side (comparisons between the lower ends of their tibiotarsi indicate it was a slightly larger bird), and it is slender when compared to those of larger macaws. The holotype tibiotarsus is intermediate in size between those of large macaws such as the scarlet macaw (Ara macao) and the military macaw (Ara militaris), and the small chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus). Compared to the tibiotarsi of extant macaws, the bone is more slender and has a slightly greater hindwards development of the upper end. Apart from this, its only distinguishing feature is that its dimensions do not fall within those of other known species. The slender proportions of the bone and more elongated ridges around the upper end show it is a macaw and distinguishes it from the Amazon parrots such as the large imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis). The tibiotarsus of the assigned specimen is essentially identical in size to the holotype. It is from the upper articular surface, from the lower end of the fibular crest to the external condyle (the round prominences at the end of a bone), deep through the inner cnemial crest (a ridge at the front side of the head), wide and deep at the mid shaft, and wide at the lower end. The estimated length of the coracoid is from its head to the internal corner of the sternal facet, from the base of the procoracoid process to the internal corner of the sternal facet, the glenoid facet is wide and deep, the shaft is wide and deep at midpoint, and the sternal facet is wide. The upper width of the humerus is , the depth through its external tuberosity is , the depth of its head is , the width of the lower end is about , and the height and width of the radial condyle is . The carpometacarpus is long, its upper depth is , the trochlea (a grooved structure where bones join) is wide, and the shaft is at midpoint. The upper part of the radius is at its greatest diameter. The estimated length of the femur is , its upper width is , the depth through its trochanter is , the head is deep, and the shaft is wide and deep at its midpoint. Known bones of this macaw marked in red on an illustration of an unrelated parrot skeleton Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez stated that extant macaws fall into two size-clusters, representing large and small species, while the St. Croix macaw was distinct in being intermediate between the two clusters, with only the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis) and Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) being similar in size. Compared to those two macaws, they observed that the pectoral attachment on the humerus is less excavated while the capital groove (a groove separating two parts of the head of the humerus) is wider. The head of the femur is more massive and when seen from the back, more excavated under the head, neck, and trochanter, while the more robust shaft of the femur is similar to that of Ara but dissimilar to Anodorhynchus. The tibiotarsus is more robust with a flared lower extremity. The length of the tibiotarsus is shorter than in the blue-throated macaw but longer than in Lear's macaw, while the lengths of the coracoid, carpometacarpus, and femur are smaller than in either. Olson and M√°iz L√≥pez ruled out the specimen from Puerto Rico belonging to the Amazon parrots by pointing out characters only found in Ara macaws. The coracoid is more elongated and has a relatively narrow shaft, and the ventral lip of the glenoid facet (equivalent to the glenoid fossa of mammals) protrudes more. The carpometacarpus is proportionally much longer with a process on the alular metacarpal that is not curved at its upper part, while the ectepicondylar process (a bony elevation) and the attachment of pronator brevis (one of the two pronation muscles in the wing) on the humerus is placed farther upwards. The femur has a proportionally larger head, and the tibiotarsus has a narrower internal condyle and a distinctive inner cnemial crest that is more pointed and extends further upwards. Extinction All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans (both in prehistoric and historic times), though hurricanes and disease may also have contributed. Native Caribbeans hunted macaws and held them captive for later use as food, but also as pets. Since they are known from kitchen midden deposits, the macaws from Puerto Rico and St. Croix were evidently also used for subsistence. It is likely that the St. Croix macaw became extinct due to these factors, but the date it happened is unknown.

Daisy and her husband Hans Heinrich XV were the owners of large estates and coal mines in Silesia (now in Poland) which brought the Hochbergs enormous fortune.  Biography  Undated sketch of Daisy by John Singer Sargent Born Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West at Ruthin Castle in Denbighshire, Wales, she was the daughter of Col. William Cornwallis-West (1835‚Äì1917) and his wife, Mary \\"Patsy\\" FitzPatrick (1856‚Äì1920). Her father was a patrilineal great- grandson of John West, 2nd Earl De La Warr. Her mother was a daughter of Reverend Frederick FitzPatrick, himself a descendant of Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 1st Baron Upper Ossory (and thus the Kings of Osraige) and Lady Olivia Taylour, herself daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Headfort. Since the Cornwallis-West family was impoverished, the Hochbergs were forced to pay and organise the wedding. The wedding ceremony took place at St. Margaret's in Westminster on 8 December 1891. Notable witnesses were Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and his wife Princess Alexandra. Memorial to Daisy in Pszczyna, Poland During her marriage, Daisy, known in German as the F√ºrstin von Pless, became a social reformer and militated for peace with her friends William II, German Emperor and King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. During World War I she served as a nurse. After her divorce at Berlin on 12 December 1922 she published a series of memoirs that were widely read in the United Kingdom, the United States, and, in the German language, in Continental Europe. Hans Heinrich married as his second wife, at London on 25 January 1925, Clotilde de Silva y Gonz√°lez de Candamo (1898‚Äì1978). This marriage produced two children, and was annulled in 1934. Subsequently, Clotilde married her stepson, Bolko, and was the mother of Daisy's and Hans Heinrich's only grandchildren. Daisy's brother George in 1900 married Jennie Churchill, the mother of Winston Churchill, as his first wife, and after their divorce married in 1914 Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the actress, as his second. Her sister, Constance, married in 1901 Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, and after their divorce she married in 1920 James FitzPatrick Lewes.  Marriage  On 8 December 1891, in London, she married Hans Heinrich XV, Prince of Pless, Count of Hochberg, Baron of F√ºrstenstein (1861‚Äì1938), one of the wealthiest heirs in the German Empire, becoming ch√¢telaine of F√ºrstenstein Castle and Pless Castle in Silesia. The couple had four children:Jan Henryk XV von Pless in: genealogia.grocholski.pl [retrieved 5 February 2015]. * Daughter (25 February 1893 ‚Äì 11 March 1893). * Hans Heinrich XVII William Albert Edward (2 February 1900 ‚Äì 26 January 1984), Prince of Pless, Count von Hochberg and Baron of F√ºrstenstein.

This was the second selection from the diaries of Princess Daisy and, according to the introduction by the editor, was selected from a series of diaries totalling 600,000 words. The diaries describe the Princess's life as a member of the European aristocracy. There are a number of descriptions of significant pre- war political and social figures. These descriptions are not always discreet. The ambassador Metternich is described as dull and looking older than his age. In a diary entry dated 19 July 1905 the author exhibits anti-Semitic views. She describes a journey to Hamburg on a Hamburg America liner. The accommodations were not to her liking, and she described the ship as 'crammed full of awful American-German Jews'. = Death = Daisy, Princess of Pless, died in 1943 in relative poverty at Waldenburg, today Wa≈Çbrzych, Poland.

R. Odell Elementary School, a part of the Cabarrus County Schools system. It lies between Huntersville and Concord. History =Prior names= The oldest name for this community on record was the name given to the township, Deweese, in the mid-19th century. This was the family name of one of the land owners in the community, whose name was also given to the community schoolhouse. The land on which the schoolhouse was located is now occupied by Gilwood Presbyterian Church. Other colloquial names for the community which originated near the turn of the 20th century included Gandersburg and Pinchgut. Gandersburg stemmed from a community sport where a live goose was tied head-down in a large tree behind the Will Johnson General Store and horseback riders would attempt to snatch the head from the goose while going at full gallop. Pinchgut referred to the hard times the community went through during Civil War Reconstruction. =Roads= The main road through the community was originally known as Statesville Road, which occupied portions of the current North Carolina Highway 3, Odell School Road, Bradford Road, Macedonia Church Road and North Carolina Highway 73 on its route between Mooresville and Concord. In 1929, the state built a paved, two-lane road through the area. The road was originally signed as North Carolina Highway 74. In 1935, U.S. Route 74 was built through North Carolina, and the state highway was re-signed as North Carolina Highway 73, more commonly as Davidson-Concord Highway. With the completion of this highway, the antiquated bridge on the Statesville Road over Coddle Creek was demolished, and the lower end of Statesville Road was re-routed to link to Poplar Tent Road and Derita Road, crossing Highway 73 and forming what is now considered the center of the Odell School community. This road is currently known as Odell School Road. In the late 19th century, the mill village of Kannapolis was founded in northern Cabarrus County, and a road was extended from Baker's Creek in that village to join with the Statesville Road just west of Coddle Creek. This road was known for many years as Mooresville Road, then Mooresville-Kannapolis Highway. It now forms a major part of Dale Earnhardt Boulevard, or North Carolina Highway 3. Churches =Gilwood Presbyterian Church= The founding of this church occurred in November 1889 on the Deweese Schoolhouse property donated to the church by Isaiah Deweese. The first sanctuary was erected in the 1890s, and a fellowship building, \\"The Hut\\" was built in the 1920s. The sanctuary was expanded by adding Sunday School rooms and was brick veneered in the 1930s. By the middle of the 20th century, plans were being made for reconstruction of the church facilities. An educational wing was built in 1963. This was followed by a new sanctuary, connected to the educational wing, in 1969. The former sanctuary was demolished soon after. A greatly expanded fellowship hall and ministry center was built, replacing \\"The Hut\\" in the 1990s. The latest project, remodeling and expansion of the church sanctuary, was finished in 2004. Founded as a congregation in the Presbyterian Church in the United States, or Southern Presbyterian denomination, a 1980s merger brought it into the fold of the Presbyterian Church (USA). =Shiloh United Methodist Church= This church was founded in the late 19th century as a congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Through the process of mergers, the congregation is now a part of the United Methodist Church. The original sanctuary was constructed on Odell School Road just south of Shiloh Church Road, and was a frame structure, outfitted with an open steeple and three bells. Despite the name, this church was never located on Shiloh Church road, but rather to the south of it. In the 1930s, the sanctuary was remodeled and the steeple enclosed to a more traditional design. An educational wing and fellowship hall were constructed in the 1960s, and the sanctuary was replaced with a brick structure in the 1990s. The original sanctuary building still exists, having been moved to a site on Shiloh Church Road and converted to a private residence. =Odell Baptist Church= Founded as a daughter church of Concord First Baptist Church, the Pastorium (parsonage) and the original sanctuary of the church was constructed in the early 1960s. Other buildings for the church were constructed later in the 20th century, with the original building being converted to an educational center and the Pastorium being converted to church offices. This church is located east of the Coddle Creek Reservoir on North Carolina Highway 73. Odell Baptist Church is a constituent church of the Southern Baptist Convention. =Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church= This church congregation was begun following the Civil War, when African-American members of Poplar Tent Presbyterian Church decided to form their own congregation. Their original sanctuary was a frame structure built off of Odell School Road. This building served the congregation for nearly a century, being replaced with a brick structure in the late 1960s. For most of its history, Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church has shared a pastor with nearby Bethpage Presbyterian Church, Concord. Founded as a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., denominational merger has brought them into the fold of the Presbyterian Church (USA). Schools =Deweese/Gilwood School= The founding of Gilwood Presbyterian Church in 1889 led to the re- naming of the community school building to Gilwood School and its relocation to a building behind the former Will Johnson General Store at the corner of Statesville Road and Mason Goodman Road (now called Windy Road). =Odell High School= In 1929, W. R. Odell School was built on the corner tract of land formed by the newly routed highways. The school was named for the founder of Odell Mill, the first textile mill in Cabarrus County. Odell School consolidated community schools at Gilwood, Bethpage, Poplar Tent and Macedonia, and initially offered eleven grades of instruction in one location. The school was expanded to twelve grades in the 1940s, and remained the community's only school and namesake until further school consolidations began in the late 20th century. =County consolidation and new facilities= Grades 9 through 12 were moved to Northwest Cabarrus High School in 1966, and grades 6 through 8 to Northwest Cabarrus Middle School in 1988. A replacement school on Moss Farm Road (off Harris Road) was constructed, and Kindergarten and elementary grades began the 2007‚Äì2008 school year in the new facility. Beginning with the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, high school students in grades 9, 10 and 11 began attending the newly constructed Cox Mill High School, located on the southern edge of the Odell School community. 12th grade continued to attend Northwest Cabarrus High School to graduate in 2010, and in the fall of 2010 Cox Mill expanded to a full four-grade high school. In 2016, Odell School was reconstructed on its original property, and reopened as a school for grades 3-5 by the name of W.R. Odell Elementary School, moving students in these grades from the now-renamed W.R. Odell Primary School on Moss Farm Road. Odell Volunteer Fire Department Organized in 1961, the department's \\"trial by fire\\" came on a winter night in 1963, when the gymnasium of the former Odell High School burned down. Though the gym was a total loss, the department was able to save the adjoining school buildings from destruction. The Odell Volunteer Fire Department is housed in a modern facility on Highway 73, and has expanded to provide First Responder service for the area. Most of the firefighters are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians. The department serves as backup and assistance to the Concord (NC) Fire Department for emergency calls to Concord Regional Airport. In 2010, Odell Volunteer Fire Department built its first substation, a five-bay facility on Shiloh Church Road. The station was designed to function as a fully stand-alone fire department, in anticipation of future annexation in the area by Concord, Kannapolis and/or Davidson. Nightingale Nursing Home This nursing facility was founded in the early 1960s by Mrs. Bertha Hartsell and Mrs. Florence Furr, neighbors and residents of the Odell School Community. Initially an Intermediate Care Facility, by the 1970s the facility had upgraded to Skilled Nursing Facility status. In the late 70s, sale of the facility resulted in a name change to Brian Center-Odell, although the facility remained privately owned by one of the officers of the Brian Center Corporation. A later split with the corporation resulted in a name change to Odell Nursing Center. A major expansion in the 1980s doubled the number of beds in the facility, and was followed by a sale in 1990 to Kentucky-based Cardinal Health Care. In 1995, Cardinal built a new facility near Kannapolis, North Carolina and transferred the nursing services out of the Odell School community. The buildings are currently abandoned, as the owners of the property seek further development options. Community stores =Johnson's General Store= Johnson's General Store was owned and operated by several generations of the Johnson family, beginning in the mid-19th century, and was located at the intersection of the current Odell School Road and Windy Road. It was long recognized as a community gathering place, and as automobiles began to be owned by community residents, the store became a dealer of Standard Oil, Esso and finally Exxon gasoline and petroleum products. Through the early part of the 20th century, William Johnson owned the store. His brother, Thomas Johnson assumed ownership in the late 1950s until the store closed in 1978, The building still stands, and is currently used as a residence. =Odell Grocery history= Closer to the center of the Odell School community, the Hartsell Store was founded in 1920 near the corner of present-day Odell School Road and Lockwood Road. When Highway 73 was routed through the community, the Hartsell family moved the store to the corner of the highway across from Odell School. There, they transformed it into a full-service gasoline station. In the mid-1950s, The Hartsell family sold the service station to W. A. (Dub) Irvin, and as Irvin's Service Station it served motorists passing through the community for over 30 years. Irvin retired and after renting the store for several years he sold it to Carl Overcash, another longtime Odell School community resident, and the name changed to Carl's General Store. Following the death of owner Ronald Overcash in 2010, the store was sold and became known as Odell Grocery. Over the years, the service station has sold Gulf Oil, Union 76 and Phillips 66 gasoline and petroleum products and currently sells Marathon branded fuel. Tulin telephone exchange Odell Community once had its own telephone exchange, independent of the Bell System. The system was operated by the Johnson Family, who ran it from their boarding house on what is now Odell School Road. The system was built in the years following World War I from surplus electrical equipment and telephone poles harvested from land in the community. At its peak, some 50 families and 5 businesses were on the exchange, which took its \\"company\\" name from the nickname of Mrs. Johnson, who served as operator. The \\"Tulin\\" exchange served to link widely separated farm families of the day, and connect them with medical, law enforcement and other vital services in the community. One long-distance telephone line . . . to the county seat of Concord (NC) . . . was available to the exchange. Individual telephone numbers were identified by the exchange name, followed by the number of \\"long\\" rings followed by the number of \\"short\\" rings. For example, someone with the telephone number \\"Tulin 24\\" would know that they had a call when the telephone rang with two long rings and four short ones. Telephone service on the \\"Tulin\\" exchange ended in 1942, when the lines were taken down and the telephones scrapped for salvage metals to aid the fighting of World War II. For the next decade, telephone service to the Odell School community was limited to two lines to Concord . . . one at Odell High School and the other at Johnson's General Store. By 1952, The Concord Telephone Company began to connect the community to both Concord and Kannapolis with rotary-dial telephone service. Current issues As of late there has been considerable push to incorporate the community. In a movement known as BLOCK (Better Land-use for Odell, Cabarrus, and Kannapolis), citizens have pushed for incorporation to halt the recent attempts by the city of Kannapolis to annex the area and use it as an enlargement for their tax base. Location The Cabarrus County seat of Concord, North Carolina is located some 11 miles east of Odell School. To the west lie the North Mecklenburg towns of Huntersville and Davidson, located on the eastern bank of Lake Norman. The community consists of a volunteer fire department, gas station, elementary school, and 1,100 residences.

It was announced in 2005 and cancelled in 2011. Premise The Outsider was set in a city based on Washington, D.C. and its surrounding areas, including the CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Joint Base Andrews, and Newport News Shipbuilding. The player controlled a CIA intelligence officer, Jameson, who could use various hand-to- hand combat styles and weapons. The game's opening sequence depicts the character wrongly becoming a fugitive, and leaves the player to decide how to continue. Development Frontier Developments claimed that the game would abandon the traditional, prescriptive, mostly linear story of current generation games, and replaced it by simulating characters‚Äô motivations and aims. This gave the player genuine freedom to change the story outcomes, with each player having a unique experience rather than simply switching between good or evil‚Äô. Director David Braben said that this level of freedom would demonstrate what it is to be a \\"next-gen\\" video game. A new animation system was being developed with the aim of giving a more realistic feel as it is adaptive and less scripted than typical animations. After six years of development, The Outsider was dropped in January 2011 by publisher Codemasters, leading to nearly 30 staff layoffs. Braben confirmed that development had ceased. In 2014, Braben told Eurogamer that The Outsider was probably \\"gone for good\\".

He was a professor at the Moscow State University and was known for his work in group theory, especially on the Burnside problem. Biography Adian was born near Elizavetpol. He grew up there in an Armenian family. He studied at Yerevan and Moscow pedagogical institutes. His advisor was Pyotr Novikov. He has been working at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. Alexander Razborov was one of his students. Mathematical career In his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function f(x) of a real variable satisfying the functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician Edwin Hewitt from the University of Washington gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later. By the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group G, for any group G. These results constituted his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian‚Äôs result was immediately used by Andrey Markov Jr. in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic. =Burnside problem= About the Burnside problem: > Very much like Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside‚Äôs problem > has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination > exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns > out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the > mind of the mathematician. Before the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for n \\\\in \\\\\\\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\\\\\\\} and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period n. The only question was to find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the form X^n = 1. An approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both collaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods n > 4381, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well. The solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding and deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result is one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction used in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened by 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by the exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words of Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more ‚Äòpenetrating‚Äô than Adian. In contrast to the Adian‚ÄìRabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way ‚Äòclosed‚Äô the Burnside problem. Moreover, over a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify the method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other fundamental problems in group theory. By the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors appeared who mastered the Novikov‚ÄìAdian method, the theory already represented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both periodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.

She worked as a type designer at Adobe Systems from 1988 through 1999, during which time she designed, or contributed to the design of, many typefaces, including Trajan, Myriad and Adobe Caslon. Twombly retired from Adobe and from type design in early 1999, to focus on her other design interests, involving textiles and jewelry. A biography of Twombly and her type design career by Nancy Stock-Allen was published in 2016. Education Carol Twombly was born June 13, 1959 in Concord, Massachusetts. She attended and graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) where she first studied sculpture, and later changed her major to graphic design. She credits her professors Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes, whose studio she worked in, for her inspiration and stimulating her interest in typography. Gerard Unger, a visiting instructor at RISD during Twombly's time as a student, also influenced her work. At Stanford University Twombly was one of only five people to graduate from the short-lived digital typography program with Masters of Science degrees in computer science and typographic design.  Career  Twombly joined Adobe in 1988. One of her first projects at Adobe was Trajan. As a designer, Twombly closely studied historical scripts for inspiration in creating digital fonts. She successfully translated Roman inscriptions‚Äîstone carvings on Trajan's column‚Äîinto a modern digital design: the typeface Trajan, in 1989. She next drew upon her background as a calligrapher and interest in paleography to translate Carolingian versals, or decorative capital letters, into a digital typeface called Charlemagne (also in 1989). The specific source was a page of the Anglo-Saxon Benedictional of Saint Aethelwold in the British Library. Similarly, Twombly based Lithos on historical precedents, although more generally to ancient Greek inscriptions, rather to any specific models. Adobe marketed Trajan, Charlemagne, and Lithos as \\"Modern Ancients.\\" In designing Adobe Caslon, she also worked closely with the well-known eighteenth-century typeface designed by the William Caslon foundry to create a modern digital equivalent. She collaborated with Robert Slimbach to create the sans serif Myriad, her first completely original typeface design. Awards In her first international type design competition, Twombly was awarded the Morisawa gold prize for her typeface design in 1984.\\"Twombly, Carol\\" in Friedl, Friedrich, Nicolaus Ott, and Bernard Stein. Typography : an Encyclopedic Survey of Type Design and Techniques Throughout History. New York: Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998, pp. 517-518. Subsequently, Morisawa Ltd., a Japanese typesetting manufacturer and the sponsor of the competition, licensed and marketed her entry as the Mirarae typeface.

After this series, she went on to design two more typefaces for Adobe: Nueva, an original design, and Chaparral, which references nineteenth-century slab serif forms and sixteenth-century roman book hand, a calligraphic form. She designed Chaparral in collaboration with calligrapher Linnea Lundquist. Retirement Twombly left Adobe in 1999. Speaking in 2014, she cited a variety of reasons for the decision, including a lack of interest in designing fonts for onscreen display and the market failure of Adobe's multiple master font technology. She is currently an independent artist, specializing in drawing, painting on textiles, beading shekeres, and basket-making.

Geography  Mapoon Aboriginal Community is located at Port Musgrave, western Cape York in Far North Queensland, Australia. The community differs from many other Cape communities in that the quality government built residences are spread out in bushland along Red Beach Road towards Cullen Point rather than being clustered together. During the wet season from December to April the area is largely inaccessible except by air and sea. History Teppathiggi (also known Tepithiki and Teyepathiggi) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Western Cape York, Middle Dulcie River, Lower Batavia River, Ducie River, and Mapoon. The language region includes areas within the local government boundaries of Cook Shire Council. Uradhi (also known as Anggamudi, Ankamuti, Atampaya, Bawtjathi, and Lotiga) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Western Cape York Peninsula. The traditional language region includes north of Mapoon and Duyfken Point and east of the coast strip to the north of Port Musgrave (Angkamuthi country) incorporating the mouth of the Ducie River, the lower reaches of the Dulhunty River and the upper reaches of the Skardon River in the north. Following the displacement of Indigenous people by British settlement, it was also spoken in the Northern Peninsula Area Region including the communities of New Mapoon, Injinoo and Cowal Creek. A Presbyterian mission was established at Mapoon in 1891 with the aim of providing education and health services to the Aboriginal people. By 1907, under the Reformatories Act, it was operating as community for local people. In the 1950s when bauxite was discovered on the Western Cape area, the Queensland Government passed legislation to help the interested companies Comalco and Alcan with the Comalco Act (Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty Ltd Agreement Act 1957 (Qld)). As a consequence some 8,000 square kilometres were excised from the mission reserve. The government, together with Comalco determined to evict the residents off the mission, and they were moved forcibly by the Queensland police from Old Mapoon to New Mapoon on 15 November 1963. The closing of the Mission was explained publicly as a measure to 'rationalise services' for the Cape indigenous people by centralising them in the Bamaga area. In November 1963, people were forced from their homes by armed police. They were then transported by ship. The police raid was ordered and overseen by Patrick Killoran, the then director of Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland. Historical reports suggest that people were forced or tricked to board the barge. Reports also claim that local people viewed the Aboriginal residents' houses were burnt to the ground to prevent the residents returning, however government reports state some houses were burnt due to their dangerous and verminous condition. Many residents were unhappy at Bamaga, at one of the nearby communities now known as New Mapoon. Over the following years, many moved back to (Old) Mapoon and eventually the government provided new housing. The 1996 census population of Mapoon was 139. In 2000, the Mapoon Aboriginal community was formally recognised under Deed of Grant in Trust arrangements. The Mapoon Aboriginal Council administers the community affairs with government support. At the 2006 census, Mapoon had a population of 239. At the the town recorded a population of 263 and 90% of the town's population was of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. Facilities Presently the town has a primary school, nursing station, council office and small shop providing fuel and food. Local people are employed on the Council which as well as providing services for the local community in 2006 won the contract to provide road maintenance for the all- weather dirt road from the town of Weipa. There is also a productive fishing business, providing mudcrabs to southern markets from the Port Musgrave Bay and Dulhunty and Wenlock rivers. Camping facilities near the town are found at Cullen Point and Janie Creek. The area is known for excellent fishing and crabbing.  Education  Mapoon State School opened on 30 January 1995. The school became Western Cape College - Mapoon on 1 January 2002. Alcohol Management Plan An \\"Alcohol Management Plan\\" exists in the community, with restrictions on the amount and type of liquor that may be carried on persons or vehicles in the area. This Plan was formulated and requested by the majority of Elders within the community and passed by law by the Government of Queensland into S.168 of the Liquor Act 1992. It is enforced by the Queensland Police based at Weipa.

Since the fraternity's founding on January 5, 1911 at Indiana University Bloomington, the fraternity has never limited membership based on color, creed or national origin. The fraternity has over 160,000 members with 721 undergraduate and alumni chapters in every state of the United States, and international chapters in the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Japan, United States Virgin Islands, Nigeria, South Africa, and The Bahamas. The president of the national fraternity is known as the Grand Polemarch, who assigns a Province Polemarch for each of the twelve provinces (regions) of the nation. The fraternity has many notable members recognized as leaders in the arts, athletics, business, Civil Rights, education, government, and science sectors at the local, national and international level. The Kappa Alpha Psi Journal has been the official magazine of the fraternity since 1914. The Journal is published four times a year in February, April, October and December. Frank M. Summers was the magazine's first editor and later became the Fourteenth Grand Polemarch. The former editor of the magazine was Jonathan Hicks. The current editor of the magazine is Earl T. Tildon. Kappa Alpha Psi sponsors programs providing community service, social welfare and academic scholarship through the Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation and is a supporter of the United Negro College Fund and Habitat for Humanity. Kappa Alpha Psi is a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). The fraternity is the first predominantly African American Greek-letter society founded west of the Appalachian Mountains still in existence, and is known for its \\"cane stepping\\" in NPHC organized step shows. Kappa Alpha Psi celebrated its 100th anniversary on January 5, 2011, and is one of four predominantly African American collegiate fraternities to do so. History =Founders= The founders of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. are: Elder Watson Diggs, more affectionately known as 'The Dreamer', Dr. Ezra D. Alexander, Dr. Byron Kenneth Armstrong, Atty. Henry Tourner Asher, Dr. Marcus Peter Blakemore, Paul Waymond Caine, George Wesley Edmonds, Dr. Guy Levis Grant, Edward Giles Irvin, and Sgt. John Milton Lee. The founders endeavored to establish the fraternity with a strong foundation before embarking on plans of expansion. By the end of the first year, the ritual was completed, and a design for the coat of arms and motto had begun. Frederick Mitchell's name is on the application for the Incorporation of the Fraternity but withdrew from school and thus never became a member of the Fraternity. =Founding= The fraternity was founded as Kappa Alpha Nu on the night of January 5, 1911, by ten African-American college students. The decision upon the name Kappa Alpha Nu may have been to honor the Alpha Kappa Nu club which began in 1903 on the Indiana University campus but had too few registrants to effect continued operation. The organization known today as Kappa Alpha Psi was nationally incorporated under the name of Kappa Alpha Nu on May 15, 1911. The name of the organization was changed to its current name in 1915, shortly after its creation. Kappa Alpha Psi initiate Frank Summers was one of eighteen members of the Indiana University Track team awarded the letter \\"I\\" in 1915. During this time there were very few African-American students at the majority white campus at Bloomington, Indiana and they were a small minority due to the era of the Jim Crow laws. Many African-American students rarely saw each other on campus and were discouraged or prohibited from attending student functions and extracurricular activities by white college administrators and fellow students. African-American students were denied membership on athletic teams with the exception of track and field. The racial prejudice and discrimination encountered by the founders strengthened their bond of friendship and growing interest in starting a social group. By 1913, the fraternity expanded with the second undergraduate chapter opened at the University of Illinois--Beta chapter; then the University of Iowa--Gamma chapter. After this, Kappa Alpha Psi chartered undergraduate chapters on Black college campuses at Wilberforce University--Delta chapter, and Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)--Epsilon chapter. In 1920, Xi chapter was chartered at Howard University. In 1921, the fraternity installed the Omicron chapter at Columbia University, its first at an Ivy League university. The fraternity's first chapter in the South was established in 1921 at Morehouse College‚Äî Pi chapter. Kappa Alpha Psi expanded through the Midwest, South, and West at both white and black colleges. Some believe the Greek letters Kappa Alpha Nu were chosen as a tribute to Alpha Kappa Nu, but the name became an ethnic slur among racist factions. Founder Elder Watson Diggs, while observing a young initiate compete in a track meet, overheard fans referring to the member as a \\"kappa alpha nig\\", and a campaign to rename the fraternity ensued. The resolution to rename the group was adopted in December 1914, and the fraternity states, \\"the name acquired a distinctive Greek letter symbol and KAPPA ALPHA PSI thereby became a Greek letter Fraternity in every sense of the designation.\\" Kappa Alpha Psi has been the official name since April 15, 1915. In 1947, at the Los Angeles Conclave, the National Silhouettes of Kappa Alpha Psi were established as an auxiliary group, which membership comprises wives or widows of fraternity members. In 1980, the Silhouettes were officially recognized and granted a seat on the Board of Directors of the Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation. Silhouettes provide support and assistance for the activities of Kappa Alpha Psi at the Grand chapter, province and local levels. =The Kappa \\"Kane\\"= In the 1950s, as black Greek-letter organizations began the tradition of step shows, the fraternity began using the \\"Kappa Kane\\" in what it termed \\"cane stepping\\". The kappa canes were longer in the 1950s than in later decades. In the early 1960s, the cane was decorated with the fraternity colors. In the 1970s the cane was shortened so brothers could \\"twirl\\" and tap the cane in the choreography with high dexterity. The process of covering the cane in the fraternal colors is considered as 'wrapping' and is done very specifically. In the 1960s the national organization did not condone the use of canes or Kappa Alpha Psi's participation in step shows contending that \\"the hours spent in step practices by chapters each week would be better devoted to academic or civic achievement.\\" Senior Grand Vice Polemarch Ullysses McBride complained about the vulgar language and obscene gestures sometimes engaged in by cane-stepping participants during these stepshows. In 1986, during the fraternity's 66th national meeting, cane stepping was finally recognized as an important staple of Kappa Alpha Psi. National programs =Guide Right= Guide Right is a program for the educational and occupational guidance of youth, primarily inspirational and informational in character. Its reach extends to high schools and colleges alike. In the latter, giving due attention to the needs of undergraduate Brothers. Conceived in 1922 by Leon Wop Stewart, and suggested at the twelfth Grand chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, Guide Right became the Fraternity's National Service Program. Jesse Jerome Peters, later to become the eighth Grand Polemarch, was chairman of the committee, during the administration of W. Ellis Stewart as Grand Polemarch. Guide Right is administrated by a National Director and a Guide Right Commission. The Guide Right Commission consists of the Director and twelve Province Guide Right Coordinators, one from each Province, appointed by their respective Province Polemarchs. The Director is uniquely qualified to perform the duties of this office and is appointed by the Grand Polemarch. He prepares such directives as are necessary for the successful and efficient observance of this National movement. He also edits and prepares the Manual for the universal use of Undergraduate and Alumni. The five national Guide Right initiatives are Kappa League, Jr. Kappa League, A-MAN Program, St. Jude Research Hospital, and the premier program, \\"Kappa Kamp,\\" which enables inner city boys to attend camps across the county.Kamp Kappa: In addition to the above-mentioned national initiatives, chapters within the Fraternity sponsor a wide variety of Guide Right programs in their communities that support their local youth. Kappa League The Kappa League was founded Thursday, February 12, 1970 by the Los Angeles (CA) Alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi; under the direction of Leon W Steward. Steward brought the idea to Los Angeles from Dayton, Ohio, where he had worked closely with Jay Crosby to expand the guide right activities of Dayton (OH) Alumni chapter. The Kappa League is a series of activities designed to help young high school male students develop their leadership talents. The activities provide both challenging and rewarding experiences to enhance their lives. The goal of the League is to help the students achieve worthy goals for themselves and to make meaningful contributions to their communities. The League includes a series of workshops to achieve its goals. Students from grades of 6 to 12th can join .Grand Chapter 2004, op. cit., pp. 38. Student of the Year Competition The Student of the Year Competition is a contest that encompasses six areas deemed critical to a successful life - scholarship, talent, community involvement, poise and appearance, career preparation, and model chapter operation. Each Province sponsors a pageant during its Council. In the year of a Grand Chapter Meeting, the Province winners compete at the Grand Chapter Meeting. The first Student of the Year Pageant was held on May 20, 1972 at Drexel University, under the direction of Mel Davis. The first Pageant at the Grand Chapter Meeting occurred at the 58th Grand Chapter Meeting. =Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation= The \\"Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation,\\" established in 1981, is the philanthropic arm of the fraternity and assists both alumni and undergraduate chapters in support of scholarships, after-school programs, and national projects such as Habitat for Humanity. The Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation was conceived by Dr. Oliver S. Gumbs, the 23rd Grand Polemarch. His dream began to take shape at a May 1982 with the past Grand Polemarchs and the national officers in Washington, D.C. He proposed forming a separate 501(c)(3) charitable foundation to accept contributions to finance the headquarter's renovation project. Fraternity members contributing to the new foundation could deduct their donations as charitable contributions for income tax purposes. The Foundation would also accept contributions from individuals, organizations and businesses. =Pan-Hellenic membership= The fraternity maintains dual membership in the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). The NPHC is composed of nine international black Greek-letter sororities and fraternities and promotes interaction through forums, meetings, and other mediums for the exchange of information, and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions. The NIC serves to advocate the needs of its member fraternities through enrichment of the fraternity experience, advancement and growth of the fraternity community, and enhancement of the educational mission of the host institutions. Membership Wilberforce, 1922 Kappa Alpha Psi offers undergraduate and graduate membership to potential aspirants, and its constitution has never contained any clause which either excluded or suggested the exclusion of a man from membership because of color, creed, or national origin. Undergraduate chapters are located on more than 406 College and University campuses and Alumni chapters are arrayed in some 367 cities in the United States and 9 foreign countries. To be considered for membership, a candidate must have at least a 2.5 gpa on a 4.0 scale. For consideration into Kappa Alpha Psi on the alumni level, one must possess at least a bachelor's degree or the equivalent of such a degree from an accredited college or university. Kappa Alpha Psi also prides itself in that it no longer bestows honorary membership unlike other NPHC fraternities and sororities. =Hazing culture= Kappa Alpha Psi has never officially condoned hazing, but is aware that serious incidents always occur. In 1990, Kappa Alpha Psi along with fellow NPHC organizations issued a joint statement announcing the elimination of pledging. The fraternity revised its membership development and intake process, instituted policies against hazing and has taken steps to reinforce and strengthen its stance against prohibited conduct. The fraternity backed its stance by releasing Executive Order One in 1988, Executive Order Two in 1993, and Executive Order Three in 1994. However, the fraternity has still had many complaints of hazing lodged against it since then, most related with the pledging process. In 1994, Michael Davis, a Southeast Missouri State University student, was beaten to death participating in a pledging ritual by members of Kappa Alpha Psi. After a pledging ritual, fraternity members placed his lifeless body in his bed where he was officially pronounced dead. His family won a $1.4 million wrongful death lawsuit against the fraternity and several Kappas served time in prison. In 1998, 11 Kappas affiliated with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore were charged with first-degree assault and reckless endangerment for hospitalizing several pledges. One pledge was beaten so badly that many of the veins in his backside were broken and he developed a life-threatening gangrene infection. In 2006, the chapter at Florida A&M; University was suspended after two members were sentenced to serve two years in prison and three others given three years of probation due to an anti-hazing law established in Florida following a hazing death involving the Kappa Sigma fraternity at the University of Miami in 2001. According to sworn complaints made by pledges at FAMU, they were punched, hit with canes, hit with two-by-fours, and suffered extreme exhaustion due to hazing. One pledge was admitted to a hospital for two days after a brutal night of hazing left him with a ruptured ear drum and half a pint of lost blood. In 2009, Louisiana State University (LSU) placed an eleven-year ban on the fraternity for repeated hazing violations and severe abuse of pledges. LSU will not consider reinstatement of the fraternity until at least 2020.https://https//students.lsu.edu/sites/default/files/resources/files/2015%20LSU%20Greek%20Organization%20Status- CURRENT%209%2018%2015.pdf Also in 2009, two Kappas at the University of North Texas were arrested and charged with a Class B misdemeanor for brutally beating a pledge with a paddle. And also in 2009, a former pledge at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga sued the fraternity for $1 million to cover medical bills caused by an encounter with violent fraternity members. In 2010, a pre-med student at Wayne State University suffered kidney failure and was hospitalized for twelve days after weeks of physical abuse by men of the fraternity. Also in 2010, the fraternity chapter was permanently banned from the campus of Georgia State University for being a repeat offender and beating a student pledging so badly that he coughed up blood. In 2011, the fraternity registration was cancelled at the University of Texas at San Antonio for striking pledges and providing misleading information to university officials during the hazing investigation. In March 2012, the University of Florida chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi was suspended because of thirteen misdemeanor-level sworn complaints involving striking and harassing pledges. In April 2012, the fraternity at Arkansas Tech University was permanently banned from campus for beating a pledge into a coma. In 2013, a former pledge at California State University-Bakersfield sued the fraternity after being shot with a BB gun and hit with canes and horse whips that left him paralyzed. Also in 2013, nine Kappas were charged with felony assault for severely beating pledges from Youngstown State University. In 2014, 11 Kappas from the University of Georgia were arrested and charged with hazing for severely beating and humiliating pledges. In March 2014, several Kappas from the University of Memphis were arrested and charged for hazing and beating pledges. In March 2014, five Kappas from the University of Central Arkansas were arrested for beating pledges. In 2015, a D.C. man sued the fraternity for hazing and humiliation. The 45-year-old filed a $2 million lawsuit because he stated after paying his non-refundable $3,000 graduate intake membership fee, he was coerced to allow himself to be beaten with a cane, rub lotion on a Kappa, and clean a Kappa's house in only his underwear and bare feet to become a welcomed member of the fraternity. Also in 2015, a former pledge at Coppin State University sued the fraternity for $4 million due to injuries he sustained while pledging. In his lawsuit, he stated he was even beaten and terrorized by CSU Kappa alumni members in their 30s and 40s. In 2016, three unidentified men affiliated with the fraternity at the University of Central Florida (UCF) were brutally beaten by Kappas after dropping their twirling canes while dancing according to witnesses. The UCF chapter was placed on suspension and under investigation. Also in 2016, the chapter at Florida State University (FSU) was suspended by the university after a concerned mother of a pledge shared with a Tallahassee news station a disturbing video showing pledges being brutally beaten with canes by Kappas. FSU also placed the chapter under investigation to identify and prosecute all members involved in the beatings. Provinces Map of the twelve provinces of Kappa Alpha Psi. In 1921, the Fraternity was divided into districts as a result of proposed legislation by George F. David II, the third Grand Polemarch. David was first Grand Polemarch who had not been nurtured by the Alpha chapter under the influence of the Founders, proposed dividing the Fraternity into supervisory districts. The idea originated with his father who was a Presiding Elder of the A.M.E. Church. Grand Polemarch David II, implemented the division of the Fraternity into three districts. Past Grand Polemarch Irven Armstrong was assigned the first; Harrison R. Duke, the second; and Harold M. Tyler, the third district. The three districts grew into four \\"regions\\". Fifth Grand Polemarch Earl B. Dickerson changed the designation of \\"Region\\" to \\"Province\\" and \\"Regional Director\\" to \\"Province Polemarch\\" at the 15th Grand Chapter Meeting in 1925. And during the original establishment of provinces, the following provinces were established: Eastern, Middle Eastern, Central, Great Lakes, Northwestern, Western, Southern, and Southeastern Provinces. Currently there are 12 provinces with the following names: Chapters Kappa Alpha Psi has chartered over 721 undergraduate, alumni, and international chapters. The fraternity has over 150,000 members and is divided into twelve provinces (districts/regions), with each chapter under the aegis of a province.

It was released on video in the early 1980s as The Thorn. It was written, directed and produced by Peter Alexander. Its release was legally challenged on grounds that its title and advertising deceptively exploited the fame of its co-star, Bette Midler. Plot Cast The Thorn starred John Hassberger as Jesus Christ with supporting roles of Bette Midler as the Virgin Mary; James Harrison as Joseph; John Greenburg as John the Baptist; Fred LaBour as the Angel Fred; Richard Pollard as Rabbi Gabriel; Diana David as Salome; and Jack Castor and Chi Chi as queens. All of these actors were unknown and had no other film credits, with the exception of Bette Midler who was just beginning to build her singing career, had acted in a Broadway musical, and had briefly played a lead role in the off-Broadway musical Salvation in 1969. Midler had a brief appearance as a boat passenger in the 1966 film Hawaii. Conception and production Originally conceived as The Greatest Story Overtold, an irreverent spoof of the 1965 movie The Greatest Story Ever Told, the film was influenced by the increase in popularity and profitability of Christian evangelism. Peter McWilliams wrote, produced, directed and edited the film under the pseudonym Peter Alexander. He went on to write a broad range of mostly self-published, popular books. Filmed in 16mm on a shoestring budget, the crew included Paul Josephson on camera and lighting, Craig Reynolds and Jay Cassidy on camera, and Jon Duff on sound recording. It was filmed mostly in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan from 1970 to 1971. Release, marketing and legal challenge Poster for premiere showing on 1974 May 24 in New York City After its premiere showing in Detroit, the film remained underground until it was released by National Entertainment Corp. as The Divine Mr. J a few years later, to capitalize on Midler's growing fame as \\"The Divine Miss M.\\" Its premiere showing under the new title at the Festival Theater in New York City on May 24, 1974, was picketed by Midler's agent, who also challenged the film's title and marketing in court. The film received very poor reviews and soon closed. The Divine Mr. J was re-released by Rochelle Films, Inc. in 1980 after Bette Midler's starring role in The Rose. It was blocked from opening in the U.S., but it did show overseas in the early 1980s. It received poor reviews. The film reappeared as The Thorn on a Magnum Entertainment VHS video release around 1984. It was again blocked by the courts and returned underground.

December 29, 2012. Retrieved on November 7, 2013. Cheese is a combination of drugs, made by combining heroin with crushed tablets of certain over-the-counter cold medication, such as Tylenol PM. Such cold medications contain acetaminophen (paracetamol), the active ingredient in Tylenol, and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl. Cheese samples obtained in north Dallas contained between 2% and 8% heroin, in contrast to the 30% commonly found in black tar heroin. Users commonly take the powder by insufflation (\\"snorting\\") rather than by intravenous injection. This mixture is also known as \\"Tylenol With Smack\\", by analogy to the Tylenol With Codeine series. Due to the high concentrations of non-opiate substances relative to the diamorphine content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel must address the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either the completion of the toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The acetaminophen content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of acetaminophen are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, and patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not know how much acetaminophen is in any given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.

In mid-2007, a number of area stores opted either to remove Tylenol PM and similar products from their shelves or to move them to shelves within a pharmacist's view or control. The manager of a Fiesta Mart supermarket in northwest Dallas explained his store's policy shift regarding various diphenhydramine-containing products by saying local youths were stealing these items, adding, \\"We didn't want to be part of the problem or anybody dying,\\" implying that the store also pulled the products to curb abuse.\\"Dallas Stores Pull Medicine Containing 'Cheese' Ingredient,\\" ABC News, July 18, 2007. The manager stated that theft decreased after removing the products, and various local Carnival supermarkets and Walgreens pharmacies also voluntarily shifted the products to pharmacist-controlled or -monitored shelves. The Dallas Morning News unofficially reported that arrests for Cheese in DISD decreased. The district performed 71 arrests for Cheese in the 2006-2007 school year. During the 2007-2008 school year from August to December the district performed 17 arrests. The number of children seeking treatment for use of Cheese remained steady. The paper reported that usage of Cheese spread from the northwest Dallas area and into areas outside of Dallas County. Deputy Chief Julian Bernal, the commander of the narcotics division of the Dallas Police, said that he encountered more White and Black teenagers using the drug. Michelle Hemm, the director of the Phoenix Academy of Dallas, believes that Cheese arrests decreased because users took more care to conceal the drugs or did not bring the drugs to schools for fear of detection.\\"'Cheese' heroin arrests falling in Dallas school district,\\" The Dallas Morning News Production methods According to a 14-year-old girl being treated at the Phoenix Academy, water is added to the heroin.ABC News. Cheese: The Heroin for Kids, slide 3 The watered-down heroin, often called \\"monkey juice,\\" is mixed with Tylenol PM tablets.ABC News. Cheese: The Heroin for Kids, page 4 The makers of Cheese heat the mixture to remove excess water, resulting in the final product.ABC News. Cheese: The Heroin for Kids, slide 5 A more refined method for creating Cheese heroin is done by taking #4 powder heroin and crushed diphenhydramine tablets, and adding them to water such that the active ingredients dissolve into the solution. The solution is then filtered via a micron filter to remove all the cuts and binders/fillers, leaving the user with a solution of high purity diamorphine HCl and diphenhydramine hcl. The water is then evaporated off, yielding a clumpy powder containing a highly purified mixture of heroin and DPH. It can also be further purified by titrating the solution with a weak to intermediate base such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to freebase the diamorphine and DPH. This releases the bound hydrochloride salts on both the diamorphine and DPH, such that the HCl ions dissolve into the water while the heroin and diphenhydramine are freebased; this allows the molecules to precipitate out as the solution is titrated. The precipitates (heroin and DPH) are then collected, leaving behind all of the process waste. Lastly (and optionally) the super high purity (90%-99%) heroin-DPH mixture is added to a water solution and hydrochloric, acetic, or citric acid is carefully titrated to yield up to 99.9% pure \\"cheese\\" heroin in the salt form, which is again run through a micron filter and extracted to a powder via evaporation (water- soluble, and as such is the type used for injection and insuffalation ROA's) otherwise this step is excluded and the Cheese is in a super pure base form (which can be efficiently smoked). Deaths Deaths directly attributable to this form of heroin are difficult to confirm because coroner's offices frequently do not have a method to track cause of death to one specific form of a drug. Centralized reporting of cheese heroin deaths does not exist in Texas since each county has its own official to sign death certificates. =2006: The first deaths are reported = Several of the deaths are notable due either to the publicity that followed or unusual circumstances of the case. One of the earliest published instances of a death attributed to cheese heroin was that of Karen Becerra, an 18-year-old high school senior found dead by her father in their West Dallas home on April 24, 2006. Police attributed her death to snorting cheese and drinking alcohol. On November 1, 2006, 17-year-old Keith Witherspoon died in nearby Mesquite; a story the following month in The Dallas Morning News profiled Witherspoon as \\"the first Dallas- area youth publicly known to have died of a heroin overdose since the 'cheese' concerns were raised.\\"Kim Horner, \\"Mesquite family unable to save teen from drugs: Seeking help, family found only dead ends\\", The Dallas Morning News, December 31, 2006 The death was also notable because Mesquite is located northeast of Dallas, indicating the problem had moved beyond its origins in the northwest quadrant of the city. =Early 2007: Deaths in younger populations = The first middle-school \\"cheese\\" death in published accounts was that of Oscar Gutierrez, a 15-year-old eighth grader in northwest Dallas, who died February 18, 2007;Rebecca Lopez, \\"Mom speaks out after 'cheese' claims son's life,\\" WFAA-TV (Dallas, Texas), Feb. 21, 2007 his brother stated that the boy had previously survived an overdose of the same drug.Anna Schecter, \\"Who Killed Oscar Gutierrez?\\",The Blotter, ABC News, Feb. 28, 2007. Community rallies followed Gutierrez' death as parents and others urged the police and school district to become more active in fighting what was viewed as a growing problem. The death of Fernando Cortez Jr., a high school student, on March 31, 2007, led to further community activism. Initially this death was linked to cheese heroin based on the father's comments in press reports; the father said his son was at a Dallas party when he was offered \\"cheese\\" and that the boy had not tried drugs before that he was aware of.\\"Police: Boy, 15, Found Dead,\\" KXAS-TV, April 4, 2007.\\"Muere otro estudiante por drogas: Estudiaba en la escuela Molina de Dallas,\\" [\\"Another student dies from drugs: He studied at Dallas' Molina school\\"], Univision KUVN-TV, April 4, 2007 (in Spanish) Mart√≠n Mart√≠nez. \\"Padre de joven v√≠ctima aconseja a familias vigilar a menores,\\" [\\"Father of young victim advises families to keep watch over minors\\"] Diario La Estrella, April 4, 2007 (in Spanish)Sergio Chapa.\\"Family believes teen's death may be tied to 'cheese' heroin,\\"The Dallas Morning News, April 4, 2007 Cortez's father went on to become a speaker at community meetings within the school system, urging that parents keep closer watch over their children.Sergio Chapa.\\"Una lecci√≥n llena de dolor\\" [\\"A lesson filled with pain\\"], Al D√≠a, May 1, 2007 (in Spanish) On April 24, the same day toxicology results were announced confirming the link to cheese, police announced a family friend would be charged with murder for having mixed the drugs for Cortez.Jason Trahan. \\"'Cheese' heroin claims 18th school-age victim,\\" The Dallas Morning News, April 24, 2007. =Spring/summer 2007: Old deaths examined, new deaths occur = Between the time of Cortez Jr.'s death and the announcement of his toxicology tests in late April, The Dallas Morning News published the results of a lengthy analysis of autopsy results between 2005 and 2007, conducted in concert with the Dallas County medical examiner's office, which suggested that as many as 17 deaths among adolescents during that period were attributable to cheese heroin, not including the Cortez death. The conclusion was based in part on the presence of both heroin and diphenhydramine in the blood of the deceased; additionally, the families of 11 victims confirmed the deceased had used cheese heroin. Some toxicologists questioned the results due to the absence of acetaminophen. Other experts argued that acetaminophen has a shorter half-life and might have been metabolized by the body prior to death. Susan Dalterio, a University of Texas at San Antonio pharmacology expert, insisted that the combination was unlikely to be a coincidence, as a person sleepy from diphenhydramine would be unlikely to be abusing heroin at the same time.Jason Trahan. \\"'Cheese' crisis runs deep,\\", The Dallas Morning News, April 15, 2007 It is common for users of heroin and other opioid drugs to take diphenhydramine-containing medications as an attempt to alleviate side effects resulting from histamine release induced by opioid administration, such as pruritus, as well as potentiate the sedative effects of the drug. On April 18, days after findings from the medical examiner's review were published, two more deaths occurred, though once again their connection to cheese heroin took weeks to be confirmed.

Its activities have been funding cardiovascular research, supporting health professionals in their practice, developing health promotion activities, informing and educating the public and assisting people with cardiovascular disease. The Heart Foundation has offices in each state and territory of Australia. History The organisation emerged after tuberculosis had been effectively removed as a health concern and after the successful establishment of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. A group of concerned Sydney professionals meet with the trustees of R.T Hall Trust and members of the New South Wales government health services in July 1958 where they decided to form the National Heart Foundation of Australia. Programs =Supporting and informing= The Heart Foundation provides people with, and at risk of, cardiovascular disease information and guidance on how to minimise their risk. Annually, the organisation distributes more than 1.3 million heart health brochures. Each year, the Heart Foundation's information service and its website provides heart health information to thousands of Australians. =Partnerships= The Heart Foundation supports and works with all levels of government, other health organisations, the media and community groups and food manufacturers to implement policies and programmes that attempt to improve the cardiovascular health of Australians. This includes programmes on cardiovascular health risks such as smoking or physical inactivity, through to recovery and rehabilitation and diet. The Foundation has partnered with the Health Star Rating System by assisting in monitoring the uptake and compliance of the Health Star Rating on applicable products. The Foundation's collected data has been used in the formal reviews of the Health Star Rating and provided help in making the system more effective and accurate. =Improving care= The Heart Foundation claims to take the latest research and creates practical treatment tools for health practitioners. The Heart Foundation attempts to bridge gaps in care through programs specifically targeting those Australians at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. =Building healthy communities= The Heart Foundation supports local governments that change neighbourhoods to create healthier communities. Initiatives by councils, such as building cycleways and upgrading walking paths are eligible for Heart Foundation Local Government Awards (to be renamed Heart Foundation Healthy Community Awards in 2011). =Promoting awareness= Through community education campaigns and media activities, the Heart Foundation promotes lifestyle changes to improve the heart health of Australians. Recent examples include the Warning Signs campaign, which raises awareness of the symptoms of a heart attack and of the need to phone 000 so that sufferers can get early treatment to have the best chance for survival. Criticisms The Heart Foundation has been criticised by professional dieticians, food nutrition experts and lay researchers for having a conflict of interest especially with regard to their Heart Tick food labelling fund raiser in conjunction with food manufacturers and government vested interests. They state the Heart Foundation has ignored recent significant nutritional intervention studies and other nutritional research on cardiovascular risk. They observe the coincidence of carbohydrate rich diets with the obesity and insulin resistant diabetes epidemics of the last 5 decades, both risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada abandoned a similar program which had endorsed some sugar rich products. The Heart Foundation's response was to review the program with a survey while consulting with other \\"stakeholders\\" in the Australian Government's planned Health Star rating system.

It differs from loneliness, which reflects temporary and involuntary lack of contact with other humans in the world. Social isolation can be an issue for individuals of any age, though symptoms may differ by age group. Social isolation has similar characteristics in both temporary instances and for those with a historical lifelong isolation cycle. All types of social isolation can include staying home for lengthy periods of time, having no communication with family, acquaintances or friends, and/or wilfully avoiding any contact with other humans when those opportunities do arise. Effects True social isolation over years and decades can be a chronic condition affecting all aspects of a person's existence. Social isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. Lack of consistent human contact can also cause conflict with the (peripheral) friends. The socially isolated person may occasionally talk to or cause problems with family members. In the case of mood-related isolation, the individual may isolate during a depressive episode only to 'surface' when their mood improves. The individual may attempt to justify their reclusive or isolating behaviour as enjoyable or comfortable. There can be an inner realization on the part of the individual that there is something wrong with their isolating responses which can lead to heightened anxiety. Relationships can be a struggle, as the individual may reconnect with others during a healthier mood only to return to an isolated state during a subsequent low or depressed mood. Perceived social isolation in humans Research indicates that perceived social isolation (PSI) is a risk factor for and may contribute to ‚Äúpoorer overall cognitive performance and poorer executive functioning, faster cognitive decline, more negative and depressive cognition, heightened sensitivity to social threats, and a self-protective confirmatory bias in social cognition.‚Äù PSI also contributes to accelerating the ageing process: Wilson et al. (2007) reported that, after controlling for social network size and frequency of social activity, perceived social isolation is predictive of cognitive decline and risk for Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the social interactions of individuals who feel socially isolated are more negative and less subjectively satisfying. This contributes to a vicious cycle in which the person becomes more and more isolated. =Neuroimaging studies= In the first resting state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) study on PSI, PSI was found to be associated with increased resting-state FC between several nodes of the cingulo-opercular network, a neural network associated with tonic alertness. PSI was also associated with reduced resting-state FC between the cingulo- opercular network and the right superior frontal gyrus, suggesting diminished executive control. Cacioppo and colleagues (2009) found that lonely individuals express weaker activation of the ventral striatum in response to pleasant pictures of people than of objects, suggesting decreased reward to social stimuli. Lonely individuals also expressed greater activation of the visual cortex in response to unpleasant depictions of people (i.e., negative facial expressions) than of objects; non-lonely individuals show greater activation of the right and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), a region implicated in theory of mind. The authors interpreted the findings to represent that lonely individuals pay greater attention to negative social stimuli, but non-lonely individuals, to a greater degree than lonely individuals, insert themselves into the perspective of others. Moreover, Kanai et al. (2012) reported that loneliness negatively correlated with gray matter density in the left posterior temporal sulcus (pSTS), an area involved in biological motion perception, mentalizing, and social perception. Social isolation in rodents Experimental manipulations of social isolation in rats and mice (e.g., isolated rearing) are a common means of elucidating the effects of isolation on social animals in general. Researchers (Cz√©h et al., 2016) have proposed isolated rearing of rats as an etiologically valid model of human mental illness. Indeed, chronic social isolation in rats has been found to lead to depression-, anxiety-, and psychosis-like behaviors as well signs of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic dysregulation (Fone &. Porkess, 2008; Karelina & DeVries, 2011; Cacioppo et al., 2015). For example, a systematic review found that social isolation in rats is associated with decreased expression of BDNF in the hippocampus, which is associated with increased anxiety-like symptoms. The effects of experimental manipulations of isolation in nonhuman social species has been shown to resemble the effects of perceived isolation in humans, and include: increased tonic sympathetic tone and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation and decreased inflammatory control, immunity, sleep salubrity, and expression of genes regulating glucocorticoid responses (Cacioppo, Hawkley, Norman, & Berntson, 2011). However, the biological, neurological, and genetic mechanisms underlying these symptoms are poorly understood. =Neurobiology= Social isolation contributes to abnormal hippocampal development via specific alterations to microtubule stability and decreased MAP-2 expression (Bianchi et al., 2006). Social isolation contributes to decreased expression of the synaptic protein synaptophysin (Varty et al., 1999) and decreased dendritic length and dendritic spin density of pyramidal cells (Silva-Gomez et al., 2003). The underlying molecular mechanism of these structural neuronal alterations are microtubule stabilizations, which impair the remodeling and extension of axons (Mitchison & Kirschner, 1984) and dendrites (Vaillant et al., 2002). Research by Cole and colleagues showed that perceived social isolation is associated with gene expression ‚Äì specifically, the under-expression of genes bearing anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid response elements and over-expression of genes bearing response elements for pro-inflammatory NF-Œ∫B/Rel transcription factors. This finding is paralleled by decreased lymphocyte sensitivity to physiological regulation by the HPA axis in lonely individuals. This, together with evidence of increased activity of the HPA axis, suggests the development of glucocorticoid resistance in chronically lonely individuals. Social isolation can be a precipitating factor for suicidal behavior. A large body of literature suggests that individuals who experience isolation in their lives are more vulnerable to suicide than those who have strong social ties with others.World report on violence and health. p.195. Editors - Etienne G. Krug, Linda L. Dahlberg, James A. Mercey, Anthony B. Zwi and Rafael Lozano. World Health Organization. Published 2002. A study found social isolation to be among the most common risk factors identified by Australian men who attempt suicide. Professor Ian Hickie of the University of Sydney said that social isolation was perhaps the most important factor contributing to male suicide attempts. Hickie said there was a wealth of evidence that men had more restricted social networks than women, and that these networks were heavily work-based.Social isolation a key risk factor for suicide among Australian men ‚Äì study. The Guardian. Author - Melissa Davey. Published 25 June 2015. Retrieved 25 July 2018. A lack of social relationships negatively impacts the development of the brain's structure. In extreme cases of social isolation, studies of young mice and monkeys have shown how the brain is strongly affected by a lack of social behaviour and relationships. =In social animal species in general= In a hypothesis proposed by Cacioppo and colleagues, the isolation of a member of a social species has detrimental biological effects. In a 2009 review, Cacioppo and Hawkley noted that the health, life, and genetic legacy of members of social species are threatened when they find themselves on the social perimeter. For instance, social isolation decreases lifespan in the fruit fly; promotes obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice; exacerbates infarct size and oedema and decreases post-stroke survival rate following experimentally induced stroke in mice; promotes activation of the sympatho-adrenomedullary response to an acute immobilisation or cold stressor in rats; delays the effects of exercise on adult neurogenesis in rats; decreases open field activity, increases basal cortisol concentrations, and decreases lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens in pigs; increases the 24-hour urinary catecholamine levels and evidence of oxidative stress in the aortic arch of rabbits; and decreases the expression of genes regulating glucocorticoid response in the frontal cortex. Social isolation in the common starling, a highly social, flocking species of bird, has also been shown to stress the isolated birds. Background Social isolation is both a potential cause and a symptom of emotional or psychological challenges. As a cause, the perceived inability to interact with the world and others can create an escalating pattern of these challenges. As a symptom, periods of isolation can be chronic or episodic, depending upon any cyclical changes in mood, especially in the case of clinical depression. Every day aspects of this type of deep-rooted social isolation can mean: * staying home for an indefinite period of time due to lack of access to social situations rather than a desire to be alone; * both not contacting, and not being contacted by, any acquaintances, even peripherally; for example, never being called by anybody on the telephone and never having anyone visit one's residence; * a lack of meaningful, extended relationships, and especially close intimacy (both emotional and physical). =Contributing factors= The following risk factors contribute to reasons why individuals distance themselves from society. *Domestic violence ‚Äì perpetrator uses social isolation as a means of controlling their victim. * Family crisis ‚Äì Mostly occurs when one member of a family neglectfully performs a harmful action. For example, if a parent performs any action against the will of their child, the child could end up in shock, and eventually feeling defeated. Furthermore, the symptoms could last for the child for an indefinite period of time, with more symptoms surfacing with the passage of time. * Health and disabilities ‚Äì People may be embarrassed by their disabilities or health problems, such that they have a tendency to isolate themselves to avoid social interaction out of fear that they would be judged or stigmatized. This is common in people who have autism and other known disorders. Sometimes, rather than embarrassment, the disability itself and a person's lack of a support network can be the cause of social isolation. * Loss of a spouse ‚Äì If a spouse has recently separated, divorced, or died, the other person may feel lonely and depressed. * Living alone ‚Äì A 2015 study by the National Center for Family & Marriage Research found 13 percent of adults in the United States were living alone, up from 12 percent in 1990. The rate of living alone for people under 45 has not changed, but the rate for Americans aged 45 ‚Äì 65 has increased over the past 25 years. People over the age of 65 are living alone less often. * Unemployment ‚Äì This can begin if someone is fired, dismissed, or released from a job or workplace, or leaves one of their own accord. If the person struggles or is unable to find a new job for a long period of time (i.e. months or years) the sense of isolation can become exacerbated. Social isolation due to unemployment has been seen to particularly affect men.Social isolation a key risk factor for suicide among Australian men ‚Äì study. The Guardian. Author - Melissa Davey. Published 25 June 2015. Retrieved 17 June 2019. * Aging ‚Äì Once a person reaches an age where problems such as cognitive impairments and disabilities arise, they are unable to go out and socialize. *Hearing loss ‚Äì hearing loss can cause communication impairment, which can lead to social isolation particularly in older adults. * Transportation problems ‚Äì If the person doesn't have transportation to attend gatherings or to simply get out of the house, they have no choice but to stay home all day, which can lead to those feelings of depression. * Societal adversity ‚Äì Desire to avoid the discomfort, dangers, and responsibilities arising from being among people. This can happen if other people are sometimes, or often, rude, hostile, critical or judgmental, crude, or otherwise unpleasant. The person would just prefer to be alone to avoid the hassles and hardships of dealing with people. * Missing certain events ‚Äì Special events are full of tradition and making memories. But if a person couldn't attend a special event, like a social gathering, dance, or any sort of outing of an event, the symptoms of isolation are on the rise, which could last for an indefinite period of time. Even if another person performed neglectful action to prevent one person from attending the event, this could instantly lead to isolation, along with other multiple symptoms, including nervous shock, which could cause the victim to keep themselves secluded from any sort of future activity to avoid any further damage. Social isolation can begin early in life. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences. Social isolation can also coincide with developmental disabilities. Individuals with learning impairments may have trouble with social interaction. The difficulties experienced academically can greatly impact the individual's esteem and sense of self-worth. An example would be the need to repeat a year of school. During the early childhood developmental years, the need to fit in and be accepted is paramount. Having a learning deficit can in turn lead to feelings of isolation, that they are somehow 'different' from others. Substance abuse can also be an element in isolation, whether a cause or a result. This can and many times does coincide with mood related disorders, but also with loneliness. According to a study that was conducted by Kimmo Herttua, Pekka Martikainen, Jussi Vahtera, and Mika Kivim√§ki, living alone can increase rates of being socially isolated and leading individuals to turn to the use of alcohol and other substances. The loss of a loved one can contribute to social isolation. Studies have shown that widows who keep in contact with friends or relatives have better psychological health. A study conducted by Jung-Hwa Ha and Berit Ingersoll-Dayton concluded that widows who had a lot of social contact and interactions lead to fewer depressive symptoms. During a time of loss social isolation is not beneficial to an individual's mental health. Whether new technologies such as the Internet and mobile phones exacerbate social isolation (of any origin) is a debated topic among sociologists. With the advent of online social networking communities, there are increasing options to become involved with social activities that do not require real-world physical interaction. Chat rooms, message boards, and other types of communities can meet the needs of those who would rather be alone, yet still develop communities of online friends. =Isolation among the elderly= Social isolation impacts approximately 24% of older adults in the United States, approximately 9 million people. The elderly have a unique set of isolating dynamics. Increasing frailty, possible declines in overall health, absent or uninvolved relatives or children, economic struggles can all add to the feeling of isolation. Among the elderly, childlessness can be a cause for social isolation. Whether their child is deceased or they didn't have children at all, the loneliness that comes from not having a child can cause social isolation. Retirement, the abrupt end of daily work relationships, the death of close friends or spouses can also contribute to social isolation. In the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, a significant sector of the elderly who are in their 80s and 90s are brought to nursing homes if they show severe signs of social isolation. Other societies such as many in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and also the Caribbean and South America, do not normally share the tendency towards admission to nursing homes, preferring instead to have children and extended- family of elderly parents take care of those elderly parents until their deaths. On the other hand, a report from Statistics Norway in 2016 stated that more than 30 percent of seniors over the age of 66 have two or fewer people to rely on should personal problems arise. The use of video communication/video calls has been suggested as a potential intervention to improve social isolation in seniors. however its effectiveness is not known.  Hearing loss and isolation  One contributing factor to social isolation among elderly individuals is age-related hearing loss. The risk of hearing loss increases with age due to the non-regenerative nature of the hair cells in the ear responsible for hearing. As age increases, these hair cells will continue to be irreversibly damaged therefore causing hearing loss. Hearing loss, particularly in older adults, is associated with the inability to effectively communicate, which can lead to social isolation. Hearing loss can also make it difficult to maintain interpersonal relationships, which can result in social isolation. Hearing loss and loneliness have also shown associations. One Dutch study demonstrated a seven percent increase in odds of developing loneliness for each one decibel drop in sound perception in adults under 70 years old.  Isolation and health and mortality  Social isolation and loneliness in older adults is associated with an increased risk for poor mental and physical health and increased mortality. There is an increased risk for early mortality in individuals experiencing social isolation compared to those who are not socially isolated. Studies have found social isolation is associated with increased risk in physical health conditions including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, elevated stress hormones, and weakened immune systems. Social isolation has also been found to be associated with poor mental health including increased risk for depression, cognitive decline, anxiety, and substance use. Social isolation in elderly individuals is also associated with an increased risk for dementia. =Isolation among children and teens= Middle school is a time when youth tend to be sensitive to social challenges and their self-esteem can be fragile. During this vulnerable time in development, supporting students' sense of belonging at school is of critical importance. Existing research finds that adolescents' development of a sense of belonging is an important factor in adolescence for creating social and emotional well-being and academic success. Studies have found that friendship-related loneliness is more explanatory for depressive symptoms among adolescents than parent-related loneliness. One possible explanation is that friends are the preferred source of social support during adolescence. Scientists have long known that loneliness in adults can predispose depressive symptoms later in life. Lately, they have also seen that lonely children are more susceptible to depressive symptoms in youth. In one study, researchers conclude that prevention of loneliness in childhood may be a protective factor against depression in adulthood. Socially isolated children tend to have lower subsequent educational attainment, be part of a less advantaged social class in adulthood, and are more likely to be psychologically distressed in adulthood. By receiving social assistance, studies show that children can cope more easily with high levels of stress. It is also shown that social support is strongly associated with feelings of mastery and the ability to deal with stressful situations, as well as strongly associated with increased quality of life.

After this period, soil fertility deteriorated and with the increasing costs, the mission soon became unviable. Also the city of Cairns was growing and needed more water.

(also known as Jinxed on promotional media) is a 1982 American comedy film starring Bette Midler, Rip Torn and Ken Wahl. Directed by Don Siegel, the veteran filmmaker would suffer a heart attack during the troubled production. This would be Siegel's final film. Plot Bonita Friml is a Las Vegas lounge singer. Her husband, Harold Benson, is a cigar-smoking recreational gambler with a long winning streak. It seems that he cannot lose to one blackjack dealer in particular: a young man named Willie Brodax. When the casino notices Willie's losing streak, they fire him, figuring that he's jinxed. Willie then lands another blackjack-dealing job in Reno, and Harold follows him there, forcing Bonita to leave behind her lucrative singing gig to go with him. When Willie sees that Harold is now in Reno, Willie reports Harold to security, but they find no cheating on Harold's part. Milt Hawkins, who works with Willie at the casino, suggests that he \\"get a piece of\\" Harold, the way Harold \\"got a piece of\\" him. Willie starts following Harold around and eventually finds his and Bonita's trailer. Willie then encounters Bonita, and the two of them end up falling in love. Then she tells him that she is tired of living with Harold and wants to do away with him. She tries to get Willie to help with the murder plot, but he is hesitant. When she insists, he agrees to help her, on one condition: if he can break the jinx, the murder will be called off. When the fateful day arrives, Harold shows up to play blackjack against Willie as usual. Harold's winning streak continues, but just when he has wagered every last dollar on one final hand, a woman sitting next to him gets annoyed by the cigar he's been smoking for good luck. She yanks the cigar away from him and extinguishes it, much to his chagrin. When he hits on his blackjack hand, he makes 20, but a surprisingly calm Willie manages to get 21, thus finally beating Harold. Willie has broken the jinx, and Harold is now flat broke. But when Willie phones Bonita to call off the murder plot, she doesn't pick up. When Harold arrives home, he pretends that he had won big so that Bonita won't know that they're broke. But while he's in the shower, he is so distraught that he commits suicide by sticking his finger in an open light-bulb socket. Not long after, Willie arrives, sees Bonita hovering over the dead body, and assumes that she had killed her husband. She assures Willie that it was a suicide, which makes him say how sorry he is that he had beaten Harold. When Bonita hears this and learns that Harold lost everything, she begins to panic. Willie reminds her of the life insurance money she is sure to get. But she points out that the insurance policy had a suicide clause, which now prevents her from collecting. So she and Willie decide to make Harold's death look like an accident. Willie drives off towing Bonita's trailer behind him and, while stopped in a remote location, puts Harold's corpse behind the wheel of the truck. Willie rolls the truck and trailer into a ravine, then heads back into town. When police discover the crashed vehicle, they conclude that Harold must have died in an accident, meaning that Bonita can now receive the insurance money. But when she goes to file the claim, she learns that Harold had allowed the policy to lapse, thus dashing any hope of her getting any benefits. But Harold did leave her a letter he wrote, which sends her on a scavenger hunt for various clues that will tell her how to get the money she'll need. The clues she finds end up spelling out \\"J-O-N-A-H,\\" as in Jonah, the Biblical prophet who was infamously jinxed in the Old Testament. Knowing what this means, Bonita heads to the casino, sits down at Willie's table, and begins to play blackjack. During her gameplay, she smokes the same kind of cigar that Harold always smoked for good luck. She goes on a winning streak of her own, upsetting Willie and his supervisors, who fear that his jinx has returned. After he is fired from this job, he drives away in his car, only to find Bonita hiding in the back seat waiting for him. She says she'd like him to join her in a new scheme she just concocted, where he goes from casino to casino working as a dealer, and they split the money they'll get after she wins all the casinos' dough playing against him.

Gilroy. He sold the film rights to the Ladd Company at Warner Bros. intending to direct; Ladd then sold the project to Herb Jaffe at United Artists for $300,000 and Jaffe hired David Newman to rewrite it. A UA production executive suggested Bette Midler for the lead and she asked for Don Siegel to direct. The script was rewritten by Jerry Blatt, Carol Rydall, Midler and Siegel. During development it was also known as The Jackpot and Hot Streak. Gilroy had his name removed from the film and was credited as \\"Burt Blessing\\".Nat Segaloff, Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors, Bear Manor Media 2013 p 266-269 Filming started on May 5, 1981 and took place at Harrah's Lake Tahoe, Lake Tahoe, MGM Grand Reno and MGM studios. Siegel had been a mentor of director Sam Peckinpah, who was having difficulty finding assignments in the film industry due to his most recent troubled production. Siegel offered Peckinpah a chance to return to filmmaking with 12 days of second unit directing work on Jinxed. Peckinpah accepted, and his collaboration with was noted within the industry. While Peckinpah's work was uncredited, it would lead to his hiring as the director of his final film, The Osterman Weekend (1983). In addition to Siegel's health problems, Midler and Wahl reportedly fought viciously throughout the filming, making no secret of their open hostility towards one another. Wahl described to the press how much he disliked kissing Midler. Years later, Midler would state that Siegel was also hostile towards her. In turn, Siegel said the experience of working with Midler was unpleasant. When asked by United Artists executive Steven Bach why he didn't quit, Siegel replied, \\"Because then I wouldn't get my fee. Why not fire me?\\"Bach, Steven. Final Cut: Dreams and Disasters in the Making of Heaven's Gate. p. 396. Lalo Schifrin composed and recorded what would have been his sixth score for Siegel on Jinxed, but it was rejected by the studio despite Siegel's objections.Los Angeles Times 1982. The film received an \\"R\\" rating in the United States. Reception Released to theaters on October 22, 1982, the movie was a box office failure. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote, \\"This is a messed-up movie that throws away what few opportunities it has to entertain us, and gets totally lost in a plot that starts as comedy and moves through farce on its way to paralysis.\\" Ebert added that Midler is such a talented singer that it was implausible to believe that her character was an unsuccessful performer, but her music numbers still supplied most of the film's few highlights. DVD release The 2004 DVD release of the movie includes the original theatrical trailer, which includes a fraction of a deleted scene: Midler, wearing her mourning gown, quickly tries to get back into the car while it's already hooked up in the carwash system.

Though she was not originally from the Celestial Zone, Xing Ling managed to emerge as one of the strongest characters by the end of first volume. Character history Originally from the pugilistic world, Xing Ling had no knowledge of what the Celestial Zone or 'spiritual energy' was about. After a series of seemingly fated incidents‚Äîinvolving an attack on Xing Ling by large numbers of pugilists seeking revenge, and a battle with a ghost in which she was forced to cut off her hair--she met the first two characters from the Righteous Way of the Celestial Zone, Wang Chan and Xue Wu. After learning about the Celestial Zone and the use of spiritual energy from the two, Xing Ling decided to carry on with her own path and leave Xue Wu and Wang Chan (who commented on her special aura). However, due to her inability to differentiate between left and right, she met up with the two again, which also seems a fated incident. After helping a village destroyed by demons, she decided to remain with the group, with Wei Qi (a childhood friend of Wang Chan obsessed with the game of Wei Qi) joining them later on. In The Celestial Zone I Vol. 4, a significant event happened to Xing Ling, changing her life from then on. Mistaking her to be from the Evil Way (due to the scent of evil monsters' blood on her body), the Aura of E-Mei entered her body, but was unable to exit. Unfortunately, her body was not meant to take in so much energy. The energy threatened to 'break out' of her body forcibly, had she not found a way to control or release the energy. Xing Ling could only control this Aura of E-Mei through cultivation of spiritual energy, meaning that she had to become part of the celestial zone. Though she was not confident of succeeding, she worked many times harder than other practitioners under the guidance of Wang Chan and Chi Xue. Within a relatively short time, she was able to create a spiritual weapon. Only Chi Xue managed to advance so quickly when the story took place. By the end of The Celestial Zone I, Xing Ling had attained the level of Man and Sword as One and together with Chi Xue, defeated Moon Monarch, leader of the evil way. Character's attribute Xing Ling's skills focus mainly on speed and agility. In The Celestial Zone II, she was found to be as fast as lightning. She often uses her leg to steer her attacks. Often, her attacks were so swift that her opponents could not see them, leaving the opponents no chance to react. Xing Ling's spirit sword is \\"Xue Xinling\\", or \\"Snow Heart Spirit\\", which she named partly after her idol, Chi Xue. Her abilities include the Shooting Stars from the Sky techniques (Shooting Star Explosion, Shooting Stars after the Moon, Glittering Shooting Stars, Shooting Stars in the Horizon, Shooting Star Up-Kick, Shooting Star Assembly) and Destructive Wind, Heavenly Thunder of Three Ultimate Cloud- Dream.

She was the first gymnast from Mexico ever to qualify for an event final at the World Gymnastics Championships and the Olympic Games. Lopez began gymnastics at the age of seven in 1984. By 1987, she was competing in international meets as a junior, including the 1987 Puerto Rico Cup, where she won a bronze medal on the floor exercise. In 1990, Lopez nearly swept the Mexican national championships, placing second in the all-around and winning the titles on the balance beam, floor exercise and vault. She represented Mexico at the 1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, but placed well out of the medals on every event. Although Mexico did not qualify a full team for the 1992 Olympics, Lopez was able to compete as an individual. In the preliminary round of competition, she finished 80th in the all-around. Following a five year hiatus from the sport, Lopez made a highly successful return to competition in 1997, winning the all-around and vault titles at the '97 Pan American Championships. Over the next three years she would become known as a vault specialist, winning gold medals on the event at the 1997 World University Games, the 1999 Gymnix International, the 2000 Pacific Alliance Championships, the 2000 Cottbus Cup and the Copa Gimnastica. Even when she did not medal, she never finished lower than sixth on vault in any competition she entered. At the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tianjin, Lopez placed 50th in the all-around during the preliminary competition; however, she was also ranked third on the vault, qualifying for the event finals. Her eventual sixth-place finish was the highest ever for a Mexican gymnast in a major international competition, and still stands as a record today. Lopez attended her second Olympics in 2000 in Sydney. She competed only on vault, qualifying for the event finals and finishing in eighth place (she later moved up to seventh after Dong Fangxiao of China was disqualified for being underage). Lopez competed in a few meets in 2001, including the Cottbus Cup and the French Telecom International, but was beset by injuries.

Etymology  Napranum is a compound word made from two languages of the local area. \\"Nap\\" (Trotj language) pronounced \\"naap\\", meaning \\"meeting place\\" and \\"pranum\\" (Thaynakwith language) meaning \\"meeting of people\\". In combination, Napranum means \\"meeting place of the people\\".  Geography  Napranum is on the western coast of Cape York Peninsula in remote Far North Queensland, adjacent to the town of Weipa and approximately 600km north west of Cairns, although the distance is 819km by road. History The traditional owners of present-day Napranum are thought to be the Alngith people, although the Anathangayth, Peppan, Thanakwithi, Wathyn and Wik Waya peoples also lived in the area. Formerly known as Weipa South, Napranum was established in 1898 by Moravian missionaries on behalf of the Presbyterian church. The Protector of Aborigines at the time, Archibald Meston, protested against the establishment of the Weipa Mission on the grounds that the people were healthy and could adequately sustain themselves. Despite this, the mission went ahead inland near York Downs station to avoid contact with luggers, who were notorious for kidnapping Aboriginal people to exploit in their diving operations. A school was established in 1900 at the mission. Very restrictive legislation was enacted by the state of Queensland in 1911, giving the Protector exceptional powers. It stated in sections 10 and 17: > \\"The Chief Protector shall be the legal guardian of every Aborigine and > half-caste child, notwithstanding that any such child has a parent or other > relative living, until such child attains the age of 21 years.\\" And, \\"The > Chief Protector may cause any aborigine or half-caste to be kept within the > boundaries of any reserve or Aboriginal institution, or be removed from one > reserve or institution and kept herein.\\"Massacres to Mining: The > Colonisation of Aboriginal Australia, p. 34. Jan Roberts. 1981. Dove > Communications. . Jan Roberts notes that the only other people treated like this were criminals and the insane. The Protector was also given the right to confine (or expel) any such person within any reserve or Aboriginal institution, and the right to imprison any Aborigine or half-caste for 14 days if, in the Protector's judgement, they were guilty of neglect of duty, gross insubordination or wilful preaching of disobedience. It also gave powers to the police to confine Aborigines to reserves to \\"protect them from corruption\\". This latter power was used by Comalco in 1957 to justify the removal of Weipa Aboriginal people. In 1932 the community had to relocate to its present site, at Jessica Point, because of malaria. At this time most of the people were Awngthim but soon different tribes and clans were brought from Old Mapoon (when the people were forcibly removed and the settlement burnt down on 15 November 1963),Massacres to Mining: The Colonisation of Aboriginal Australia, pp. 115-116. Jan Roberts. 1981. Dove Communications. . and other communities. In 1955 a geologist, Henry Evans (1912‚Äì1990), discovered that the red cliffs on the Aboriginal reserve, previously remarked on by the early Dutch explorers and Matthew Flinders, were actually enormous deposits of bauxite (the ore from which aluminium is made) and to a lesser extent, tungsten. The Comalco Act 1957 (Qld) revoked the reserve status, giving the company 5,760 square km (2,270 sq mi) of Aboriginal reserve land on the west coast of the Peninsula and 5,135 square km (1,933 sq mi) on the east coast of Aboriginal-owned (though not reserve) land.Massacres to Mining: The Colonisation of Aboriginal Australia, p. 97. Jan Roberts. 1981. Dove Communications. . Mining commenced in 1960. The mission became a government settlement in 1966 with continued attempts by Comalco to relocate the whole community elsewhere. The company then built a new town for its workers on the other side of the bay. The Queensland Government took control of the mission in 1966. Weipa South Post Office opened on 1 December 1967 and closed in 1982. Napranum eventually received DOGIT status, and has its own community council separate from the Shire of Cook. At the 2006 census, Napranum had a population of 830.  Facilities  In 1964 the Queensland Education Department provided the teacher for the school instead of the Mission Board. Around this time, it was named Weipa Provisional School. In 1966 it was renamed Weipa South State School, then in 1976 it was renamed Jessica Point State School. On 1 January 2002 it become the Napranum Campus of the Western Cape College. The campus closed in 2005 with the students transferred to the Weipa Campus of the college. A police citizens youth club was opened in 2019 on Napranum Road. Napranum has the Mary Ann Coconut Library (Indigenous Knowledge Centre - IKC) at 320 Wa-Tyne Street, Weipa.

The mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the Moon. Launched immediately after discovery of lunar water by Chandrayaan-1,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/24/water-moon-space- exploration-india the main LCROSS mission objective was to further explore the presence of water in the form of ice in a permanently shadowed crater near a lunar polar region. It was successful in confirming water in the southern lunar crater Cabeus. It was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009, as part of the shared Lunar Precursor Robotic Program, the first American mission to the Moon in over ten years. Together, LCROSS and LRO form the vanguard of NASA's return to the Moon, and are expected to influence United States government decisions on whether or not to colonize the Moon. LCROSS was designed to collect and relay data from the impact and debris plume resulting from the launch vehicle's spent Centaur upper stage (and data-collecting Shepherding Spacecraft) striking the crater Cabeus near the south pole of the Moon. Centaur had nominal impact mass of 2,305 kg (5,081 lb), and an impact velocity of about , releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (7.2 GJ). LCROSS suffered a malfunction on August 22, depleting half of its fuel and leaving very little fuel margin in the spacecraft. Centaur impacted successfully on October 9, 2009, at 11:31 UTC. The Shepherding Spacecraft descended through Centaur's ejectate plume, collected and relayed data, impacting six minutes later at 11:37 UTC.TheStar.com, \\"NASA crashes rocket into moon\\". Contrary to media reports at the time, neither the impact nor its dust cloud could be seen from Earth, using the naked eye or telescopes. Mission The flash from the LCROSS Centaur impact. LCROSS was a fast-track, low-cost companion mission to the LRO. The LCROSS payload was added after NASA moved the LRO from the Delta II to a larger launch vehicle. It was chosen from 19 other proposals. LCROSS's mission was dedicated to late American broadcaster Walter Cronkite. LCROSS launched with the LRO aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 18, 2009, at 21:32 UTC (17:32 EDT). On June 23, four and a half days after launch, LCROSS and its attached Centaur booster rocket successfully completed a lunar swingby and entered into polar Earth orbit with a period of 37 days, positioning LCROSS for impact on a lunar pole. Early in the morning on August 22, 2009, LCROSS ground controllers discovered an anomaly caused by a sensor problem, which had resulted in the spacecraft using up 140 kilograms (309 pounds) of fuel, more than half of the fuel remaining at the time. According to Dan Andrews, the LCROSS project manager, \\"Our estimates now are if we pretty much baseline the mission, meaning just accomplish the things that we have to [do] to get the job done with full mission success, we're still in the black on propellant, but not by a lot.\\" The LCROSS trajectory Animation of LCROSS trajectory from June 18, 2009 to October 9, 2009 An illustration of the LCROSS Centaur rocket stage and Shepherding Spacecraft as they approach impact with the lunar south pole on October 9, 2009. Lunar impacts, after approximately three orbits, occurred on October 9, 2009, with the Centaur crashing into the Moon at 11:31 UTC and the Shepherding Spacecraft following a few minutes later. The mission team initially announced that Cabeus A would be the target crater for the LCROSS dual impacts, but later refined the target to be the larger, main Cabeus crater. On its final approach to the Moon, the Shepherding Spacecraft and Centaur separated October 9, 2009, at 01:50 UTC. The Centaur upper stage acted as a heavy impactor to create a debris plume that rose above the lunar surface. Following four minutes after impact of the Centaur upper stage, the Shepherding Spacecraft flew through this debris plume, collecting and relaying data back to Earth before it struck the lunar surface to produce a second debris plume. The impact velocity was projected to be or 2.5 km/second. The Centaur impact was expected to excavate more than of lunar material and create a crater about 27 m (90 ft) in diameter to a depth of about . The Shepherding Spacecraft impact was projected to excavate an estimated and create a crater approximately 18 m (60 ft) in diameter to a depth of about 3 m (10 ft). Most of the material in the Centaur debris plume was expected to remain at (lunar) altitudes below . It was hoped that spectral analysis of the resulting impact plume would help to confirm preliminary findings by the Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions which hinted that there may be water ice in the permanently shadowed regions. Mission scientists expected that the Centaur impact plume would be visible through amateur-class telescopes with apertures as small as 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 inches). But no plume was observed by such amateur telescopes. Even world class telescopes such as the Hale telescope, equipped with adaptive optics, did not detect the plume. The plume may have still occurred but at a small scale not detectable from Earth. Both impacts were also monitored by Earth- based observatories and by orbital assets, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Whether or not LCROSS would find water had been stated to be influential in whether or not the United States government pursues creating a Moon base. On November 13, 2009, NASA confirmed that water was detected after the Centaur impacted the crater. Spacecraft LCROSS spacecraft (exploded view) The LCROSS mission took advantage of the structural capabilities of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring used to attach LRO to the Centaur upper-stage rocket to form the Shepherding Spacecraft. Mounted on the outside of the ESPA were six panels that hold the spacecraft's science payload, command and control systems, communications equipment, batteries, and solar panels. A small monopropellant propulsion system was mounted inside of the ring. Also attached were two S Band omnidirectional antennas and two medium-gain antennas. The mission's strict schedule, mass, and budget constraints posed difficult challenges to engineering teams from NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Northrop Grumman. Their creative thinking led to a unique use of the ESPA ring and innovative sourcing of other spacecraft components. Usually, the ESPA ring is used as a platform to hold six small deployable satellites; for LCROSS, it became the backbone of the satellite, a first for the ring. LCROSS also took advantage of commercially available instruments and used many of the already-flight- verified components used on LRO. LRO (top, silver) and LCROSS (bottom, gold) prepared for fairing LCROSS is managed by NASA's ARC and was built by Northrop Grumman. The LCROSS preliminary design review was completed on September 8, 2006. The LCROSS mission passed its Mission Confirmation Review on February 2, 2007, and its Critical Design Review on February 22, 2007. After assembly and testing at Ames, the instrument payload, provided by Ecliptic Enterprises Corporation, was shipped to Northrop Grumman on January 14, 2008, for integration with the spacecraft. LCROSS passed its review on February 12, 2009. =Instruments= The LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft science instrument payload, provided by NASA's ARC, consisted of a total of nine instruments: one visible, two near infrared, and two mid-infrared cameras; one visible and two near-infrared spectrometers; and a photometer. A data handling unit (DHU) collected the information from each instrument for transmission back to LCROSS Mission Control. Because of the schedule and budget constraints, LCROSS took advantage of rugged, commercially available components. The individual instruments went through a rigorous testing cycle that simulated launch and flight conditions, identifying design weaknesses and necessary modifications for use in space, at which point the manufacturers were allowed to modify their designs. Results The impact was not as visually prominent as had been anticipated. Project manager Dan Andrews believed that this was due to pre-crash simulations that exaggerated the plume's prominence. Because of data bandwidth issues, the exposures were kept short, which made the plume difficult to see in the images in the visible spectra. This resulted in the need for image processing to increase clarity. The infrared camera also captured a thermal signature of the booster's impact. =Presence of water= On November 13, 2009, NASA reported that multiple lines of evidence show water was present in both the high-angle vapor plume and the ejecta curtain created by the LCROSS Centaur impact. , the concentration and distribution of water and other substances required more analysis. Additional confirmation came from an emission in the ultraviolet spectrum that was attributed to hydroxyl fragments, a product from the break-up of water by sunlight. Analysis of the spectra indicate that a reasonable estimate of the concentration of water in the frozen regolith is on the order of one percent. Evidence from other missions suggests that this may have been a relatively dry spot, as thick deposits of relatively pure ice appear to present themselves in other craters.NASA - NASA Radar Finds Ice Deposits at Moon's North Pole A later, more definitive, analysis found the concentration of water to be \\"5.6 ¬± 2.9% by mass.\\" On August 20, 2018, NASA confirmed ice on the surface at the Moon's poles. =Imagery= Awards LCROSS has received numerous awards for its technical, managerial, and scientific accomplishments. *2010: Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Corporate 2010 Award for Excellence (Northrop Grumman team) *2010: Popular Mechanics magazine's 2010 Breakthrough Award for innovation in science and technology.NASA - NASA'S LCROSS Wins 2010 Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Award *2010: NASA Honor Award ‚Äì Group Achievement, (LCROSS Science Team) *2010: NASA Honor Award ‚Äì Group Achievement, (LCROSS Mission Operations Team) *2010: NASA Honor Award ‚Äì Group Achievement, for \\"outstanding professionalism, innovation in outreach and education, and for integrating outreach for two missions into one launch.\\" (LRO/LCROSS/LPRP EPO teams) *2010: NASA Honor Award - Exceptional Achievement Medal, (Rusty Hunt) *2010: NASA Honor Award - Outstanding Leadership Medal, (Dan Andrews & Tony Colaprete) *2010: NASA Honor Award - Group Achievement, LCROSS Science and Payload Team *2010: NASA Ames Honor Award, category \\"Exceptional Achievement\\" (Ken Galal) *2010: Northrop Grumman AS Sector President's Award, category \\"Operational Excellence\\" (Northrop Grumman team) *2010: Aviation Week Laureate Award Nominee, Category \\"Space\\" *2010: Space Foundation \\"John L.

Significance of title  King Muhyul was given the title Daemusin wang, which literally means \\"Great Holy Warrior King\\". As with most Goguryeo kings, little is known about Muhyul except for what is stated in some ancient Korean sources. Some historians have inferred that the giving of such an extreme title to this man must mean that he led Goguryeo through many outstanding military accomplishments, possibly more than he is given credit for in historical texts. Another school of thought declares that the destruction of East Buyeo in itself, was an almost unthinkable feat at the time, meaning East Buyeo was a powerful kingdom according to these select scholars. Not all Goguryeo rulers were given special titles posthumously or in their lifetime. Most Goguryeo rulers were posthumously given titles based on the place of their burial. Only a select few, such as King Gwanggaeto the Great and King Dongmyeongseong, were given such \\"significant\\" posthumous names.

In the 2000s she started a hair salon business.\\"SASHA's business\\", Jamaica Star, 12 October 2004, retrieved 19 February 2011 She became a Christian in 2008 and changed her stage name, and stated that she would no longer perform the songs that made her famous.Brooks, Sadeke \\"Sasha turns over life to Christ ‚Äì Former dancehall artiste now lead singer for gospel band \\", Jamaica Star, retrieved 19 February 2011 Career =Early career and Come Again= She wrote her first rap at age 11, and as a student at August Martin High School, the young teen first performed professionally at Brooklyn's Biltmore Ballroom, modelling herself after such childhood idols as rap's greatest female act, Salt-N-Pepa, as well as Jamaican female rapper Shelly Thunder. Then, all at once, Sasha went from being a student and ‚Äúpopular chick‚Äù in class to a professional. ‚ÄúWe snuck out to see Shabba Ranks, and he was calling for a girl to get onstage and dance. All my friends were yelling out, ‚ÄòShe doesn‚Äôt want to dance, she wants to sing!‚Äô‚Äù Sasha took the mic and busted a freestyle that brought down the house. Shabba‚Äôs management, being so impressed with her display invited her to make some demo recordings, right then and there. Not two weeks went by before Steely & Clevie, computer dancehall‚Äôs whiz team, heard her demos and sought her out in New York. They flew her to Jamaica to write and cut her first record, the hardcore rap ‚ÄúKill the Bitch.‚Äù The album was released by Island on the Bogle compilation alongside tracks by established stars Buju Banton and Papa San. Sasha's track was picked as a standout by stateside DJs, and it has played for literally years in the hip-hop underground. At 16, Sasha was touring worldwide with all of dancehall's biggest names, and learning her craft through a variety of experiences. Sasha released her debut album titled \\"Come Again\\" in 1997 on Anchor Records. =\\"Dat Sexy Body\\", \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\", and Sexy Body Sasha= Sasha showed another surprising aspect of her talent in 1998, when her cut on the ‚ÄúBookshelf‚Äù rhythm, ‚ÄúDat Sexy Body,‚Äù hit clubs and radio. ‚ÄúI transformed! I really gave it to them straight-up hardcore street in ‚ÄòKill the Bitch;‚Äô then I started working with Tony Kelly, he noticed something in my voice, and asked me to try singing. He pulled something out of me that I didn't know I really had, different from my church singing. I didn't know I could sing in such a high key; Tony pulled me to the edge. Sometimes you don't recognize it yourself, but it was just in me.‚Äù Now, after a full four years of being a club and radio mix-show classic, ‚ÄúDat Sexy Body‚Äù has resurfaced as a major chart contender, with massive Miami crossover airplay spreading to the West Coast and Northeast. A Spanish version of ‚ÄúDat Sexy Body‚Äù is also in the works for immediate release. Sasha's third international hit returned her to the studio with Steely & Clevie in a duet with Sean Paul, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Still in Love,‚Äù which shot to Number One in the reggae clubs of Jamaica, London, Miami and New York. It is slated to be a future single from Sean's double-platinum album Dutty Rock, and a video, directed by Little X, has been filmed and is ready for MTV, BET, and all other music video stations. Sean and Sasha perform a snappy updated combination treatment of Alton Ellis‚Äô Studio One classic (best known globally through Althea and Donna's 1978 version ‚ÄúUptown Top Ranking‚Äù). Sasha embraces the girl-group tradition from the Supremes to Love Unlimited, I-Three and En Vogue, and brings it into dancehall with a multi-tracked performance that's at once melodious, precise and soulful. With the broadest range of vocal styles at her command, Sasha says she's in the studio getting her focus on an album that will reflect all her facets. She'll be back at work with trusted hit-makers Tony Kelly and Steely & Clevie, while joining such A-list dancehall producers as Jeremy Harding, Big Yard and Black Shadow's Troyton (producer of Sean Paul's ‚ÄúGimme the Light‚Äù).‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a hardcore Sasha, and there‚Äôs a Lauryn Hill sort of laid-back side that everyone can sing along with,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs another set of fans that want this high voice, ‚ÄòI would like to get to know you,‚Äô like in ‚ÄòSexy Body.‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Still in Love‚Äô is a subtle Sasha; aSashand those fans might not know the hardcore Sasha at all. So I look into the crowd and feel the people, and then Iknow how to work my show. And sometimes I tease them and introduce them to the other side of Sasha.‚Äù Sasha‚Äôs intuition and sensitivity about her audience is reinforced by her innate cultural connection to both the Jamaican and American audiences. ‚ÄúIn dancehall, the crossover market appreciates you, and dances to the beat, but they don‚Äôt always know what you‚Äôre saying. Even though I‚Äôm writing dancehall, my schooling was in New York, and the way I write and flow my words, all of people can understand the lyrical content of what I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù Sasha has also had a string of hits in Jamaica, including \\"Wanty Wanty\\", \\"Wine Gal Wine\\", and We Got The Love (Feat. Turbulence). Sasha was also working on an album for VP Records titled \\"Sexy Body Sasha\\" which was supposed to be released in 2006 but Sasha left the label and the album got shelved. The songs from the album will soon be released as a mixtape under the same title. =Transition to gospel music, \\"Breaking Free\\", and TryGod Records= Early 2008, saw Sasha transition into a Gospel artist and as a result of her new outlook on life, Sasha said she will not perform any of the songs that made her popular. She was known for songs like Natty On Mi Frontline and We Got The Love, which were done with her former lover, Turbulence, as well as a remake of Alton Ellis' I'm Still In Love, which she did with Sean Paul. As a Christian, Sasha sang on the Beauty of Holiness Gospel Band, which she formed about five years ago. Since then, the band has performed mainly on the north coast. They also have a song called Surround Me. However, the band's first major appearance will be at Gospel Explosion. Sasha released her first album in 17 years titled \\"Breaking Free\\" on 8 April 2014. In June 2014 Sasha signed with TryGod Records.

If a signal does not assert long enough and is not registered, it may appear asynchronous on the incoming clock boundary. A synchronous system is composed of a single electronic oscillator that generates a clock signal, and its clock domain‚Äîthe memory elements directly clocked by that signal from that oscillator, and the combinational logic attached to the outputs of those memory elements. Because of speed-of-light delays, timing skew, etc., the size of a clock domain in such a synchronous system is inversely proportional to the frequency of the clock. In early computers, typically all the digital logic ran in a single clock domain. Because of transmission line loss and distortion it is difficult to carry digital signals above 66 MHz on standard PCB traces (the clock signal is the highest frequency in a synchronous digital system), CPUs that run faster than that speed invariably are single-chip CPUs with a phase-locked loop (PLL) or other on-chip oscillator, so all the really high-frequency signals stay inside the chip and are never carried by the PCB traces. At first, each CPU chip ran in its own single clock domain, and the rest of the digital logic of the computer ran in another slower clock domain. A few modern CPUs have such a high speed clock, that designers are forced to create several different clock domains on a single CPU chip. Different clock domains have clocks which have a different frequency, a different phase (due to either differing clock latency or a different clock source), or both. Either way the relationship between the clock edges in the two domains cannot be relied upon. Synchronizing a single bit signal to a clock domain with a higher frequency can be accomplished by registering the signal through a flip-flop that is clocked by the source domain, thus holding the signal long enough to be detected by the higher frequency clocked destination domain. To avoid issues with metastability in the destination domain, a minimum of 2 stages of re-synchronization flip-flops are included in the destination domain. Synchronizing a single bit signal traversing into clock domain with a slower frequency is more cumbersome. This typically requires a register in each clock domain with a form of feedback from the destination domain to the source domain, indicating that the signal was detected. In some cases, clock gating can result in two clock domains where the \\"slower\\" domain changes from one second to the next.

As of the season, he was an area scout for the Angels based in Springfield. After being drafted by the Angels out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Gorneault spent several years in their minor league system before reaching the major leagues with the club in 2007. After a short stint in the Houston Astros organization, Gorneault signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Early life Gorneault was born to Gary and Darlene Gorneault on April 19, 1979, in Springfield, Massachusetts, and attended Cathedral High School in Springfield, where he starred in baseball and basketball. As a senior, he posted the strongest year of his high school career with 12 home runs, 41 runs batted in, and a .369 batting average.2001 UMASS Baseball Statistics at umassathletics.com, URL accessed June 24, 2009 He was a member of the Western Massachusetts Championship basketball team, and was a first-team All-Western Massachusetts baseball star, receiving MVP honors for leading the team to a 1997 Western Massachusetts title. Gorneault attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the same school attended by legendary California Angels' shortstop Gary DiSarcina, and went 2-6 in his first college start against Vermont. As a sophomore in 1999, Gorneault started in 17 of the team's 19 games, hit .333 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament, including hitting the game-winning two-run double against Temple. In the Beanpot Tournament semifinals, Gorneault collected a career-high four hits and five runs batted in, including a walk-off two-run home run in the ninth inning to defeat Harvard. In his junior year in 2000, Gorneault started 47 of the team's games, leading the team with 10 home runs, 42 runs batted in, and a .595 slugging percentage. In the season opener, Gorneault went 4-5 with three home runs against Florida. He also had the team's longest hitting streak of the season, recording a hit in 13 consecutive games, hitting .327 during the stretch. Professional career Gorneault was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 19th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, and was signed to a minor league contract on June 7, . In 2001, he played for the Provo Angels of the rookie Pioneer League. He hit .315, with 6 home runs and 30 runs batted in. However, in only 54 games, Gorneault led the team in strikeouts with 65. In 2002, Gorneault played 103 games for the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League. He recorded a .289 batting average and a .465 slugging percentage, both which led the team. In 2003, he split his time with the Single-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and Double-A Arkansas Travelers. In total, he hit a career-high .326 in 126 games, with 16 home runs and 91 runs batted in. With the Quakes alone, he led the team with 72 runs batted in. In 2004, Gorneault spent the bulk of the season with the Travelers. He led the team with 21 home runs, 81 runs batted in, 91 runs, and 128 strikeouts. His success earned him a spot with the Triple-A Salt Lake Stingers, now the Salt Lake Bees, at the end of the season. He hit .316 in only six games, with five runs batted in. In 2005, Gorneault finally had a full-time spot on the Triple-A roster. He led the Stingers in most offensive categories, including home runs, runs batted in, runs, hits, and slugging percentage.

It was a predecessor of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, existing between 1945 and 1992, under a number of different formal names, including Democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina (1943‚Äì1946) and People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1946‚Äì1964). Within Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a unique federal state with no dominant ethnic group, as it was the case in other constituent states, all of which were also nation states of Yugoslavia's South Slavic ethnic groups. It was administered under strict terms of sanctioned consociationalism, known locally as \\"ethnic key\\" ( / –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏ –∫—ô—É—á), based on the balance of political representation of 3 largest ethnic groups (Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs). Sarajevo served as the capital city throughout its existence and remained the capital following independence. The Socialist Republic was dissolved in 1990 when it abandoned its socialist institutions and adopted liberal ones, as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was, up to 20 December 1990, in sole control of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian branch of League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The borders of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina were almost identical to the one Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina had during the period of Austro-Hungarian rule that lasted until 1918. That year Bosnia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes and divided into several banovinas (regional administrative units), namely parts of Vrbas, Drina, Zeta and Croatia banovinas. With the establishment of a People's Republic, its modern borders were delineated. Name During a meeting of the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) in Mrkonjiƒá Grad on 25 November 1943. In April 1945 its name was formalized as the Federal State of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( / –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –î—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ë–æ—Å–Ω–∞ –∏ –•–µ—Ä—Ü–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞), a constituent unit of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. With DF Yugoslavia changing its name to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on 29 November 1945 as well as the promulgation of the 1946 Yugoslav Constitution two months later in January, its constituent units also changed their respective names. FS Bosnia and Herzegovina thus became known as the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Narodna Republika Bosna i Hercegovina / –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ë–æ—Å–Ω–∞ –∏ –•–µ—Ä—Ü–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞). This constitutional system lasted until the 1963 Yugoslav Constitution. On 7 April 1963, Yugoslavia was reconstituted as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and PR Bosnia and Herzegovina changed its name to the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Socijalistiƒçka Republika Bosna i Hercegovina / –°–æ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–∫–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ë–æ—Å–Ω–∞ –∏ –•–µ—Ä—Ü–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞). After independence on 1 March 1992, the country was renamed to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the Dayton Agreement that was in force, it became simply a federated state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1997. History Because of its central geographic position within the Yugoslav federation, post-war Bosnia was strategically selected as a base for the development of the military defense industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in the war that followed the break- up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was peaceful and prosperous. Being one of the poorer republics in the early 1950s it quickly recovered economically, taking advantage of its extensive natural resources to stimulate industrial development. The Yugoslavian communist doctrine of \\"brotherhood and unity\\" particularly suited Bosnia's diverse and multi-ethnic society that, because of such an imposed system of tolerance, thrived culturally and socially. The improvements to cultural tolerance throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina culminated with the selection of Sarajevo to host the 1984 Winter Olympics. =Politics= Though considered a political backwater of the federation for much of the 50s and 60s, the 70s saw the ascension of a strong Bosnian political elite. While working within the communist system, politicians such as D≈æemal Bijediƒá, Branko Mikuliƒá and Hamdija Pozderac reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic hardly escaped the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time unscathed. Following the death of Tito in 1980, rising nationalist ideas primarily noted in Serbian academia, pressured Bosnia to deal with allegations of rising nationalism in their own society. One of the most controversial events that were taken by a Bosnian political leadership was a so-called Sarajevo process in 1983 where, under significant pressure from Serbia's political leadership, Bosnian political elite used their influence to secure convictions for several Bosniak nationalists as a type of a political sacrifice to gain political points in the fight against Serbian nationalists. The Sarajevo process centered on convicting Alija Izetbegoviƒá for writing \\"The Islamic Declaration\\", a literary work which was in the Yugoslav communist regime considered a radical approach towards socialist ideals of former Yugoslavia that were based on suppression of nationalism and any violation of that doctrine was punishable by law. Such trials in the communist regime were quite common and a typical practice of suppressing the right to free speech. Bosnian politicians used this practice to reaffirm their political opposition to Serbian nationalist tendencies and in particular opposition to the politics of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá who was trying to revert the constitutional amendments of the 1970s that awarded the Bosniaks the status of a constituent ethnicity. The process also backfired as the Serbian lobby insisted that Bosnia was a \\"dark nation\\" where all those who oppose the government will be prosecuted, where Bosnian Muslim communists were prosecuting Muslim believers. That kind of propaganda attracted many Bosnian Muslims to their way of thinking. Others were interpreting the Sarajevo process as a way of removing the political amateurs who could end up disrupting the process of Bosnian independence. =The pre-war situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina= With the fall of communism and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, the old communist doctrine of tolerance began to lose its strength, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence. On the first multi-party elections that took place in November 1990 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the three largest ethnic parties in the country won: the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, the Serbian Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the elections, they formed a coalition government. Parties divided the power along the ethnic lines so that the President of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was a Bosniak, president of the Parliament was a Bosnian Serb and the prime minister a Bosnian Croat. =Towards separation= After Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its sovereignty in October 1991 and organized a referendum on independence in March 1992. The decision of the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on holding the referendum was taken after the majority of Bosnian Serb members had left the assembly in protest. These Bosnian Serb assembly members invited the Bosnian Serb population to boycott the referendum held on 29 February and 1 March 1992. The turnout in the referendum was 64-67% and the vote was 98% in favor of independence. Independence was declared on 5 March 1992 by the parliament. The referendum and the murder of two Bosnian Serb members of a wedding procession in Sarajevo the day prior to the referendum was utilized by the Bosnian Serb political leadership as a reason to start road blockades in protest. Further political and social deterioration, leading to the Bosnian War followed. The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was renamed the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 8 April 1992,Uredba o izmjeni naziva Socijalistiƒçke Republike Bosne i Hercegovine. in: \\"Slu≈æbeni list Republike Bosne i Hercegovine\\". I., br. 1, 9. aprila 1992., str. 1. losing the adjective \\"Socialist\\". It established a multi-party system and began moving toward a fully capitalist economic system.

It consists of a , open-frame, steel parachute tower. It has twelve cantilever steel arms radiating from the top of the tower; when it was in operation, these each supported a parachute attached to a lift rope and a set of guide cables. Riders were belted into a two-person canvas seat, lifted to the top, and dropped; the parachute and shock absorbers at the bottom would slow their descent. The ride was built for the 1939 New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, also in New York City. Capped by a flagpole, it was the tallest structure at the Fair. In 1941, after the World's Fair, it was moved to its current location in the Steeplechase amusement park on Coney Island. It ceased operations in the 1960s following the park's closure, and the frame fell into disrepair. Despite proposals to either demolish or restore the ride, disputes over its use caused it to remain unused through the 1980s. Since the 1990s, it has been renovated several times, both for stability and for aesthetic reasons. In the 2000s, it was restored and fitted with a lighting system. The lights were activated in 2006 and replaced in a subsequent project in 2013. It has been lit up in commemoration of events such as the death of Kobe Bryant. The ride, which is the only remaining portion of Steeplechase Park, is in Steeplechase Plaza near the B&B; Carousell. It is protected as an official New York City designated landmark and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Description  View of the pavilion from near the B&B; Carousell, looking west The Parachute Jump is on the Riegelmann Boardwalk at Coney Island between West 16th and West 19th Streets. It consists of a hexagonal base, upon which stands a six-sided steel structure. Each of the tower's legs consists of a flange column braced with horizontal ribs at intervals and diagonal ribs between the horizontal beams. The legs are grounded on concrete foundations, each of which contains twelve timber piles. The diagonal and horizontal ribs intersect at gusset plates, which contain splices at intervals and are riveted to the base. A ladder is on the north side of the structure, extending from the top of the base. There are anti- climbing devices on the frame as well. The frame also has about 8,000 lighting fixtures, which are used for night-time light shows. The tower's wide base gives it stability, while the top is tapered off. The Parachute Jump is tall. While at the 1939 New York World's Fair, the Parachute Jump was tall, having been topped by a flagpole. Twelve drop points are at the top, marked by structural steel arms, which extend outward from the tower's center, and support octagonal subframes at the far end of each arm. Eight parachute guidelines were suspended from each subframe, which helped keep the parachute open. A circular structure runs atop the subframes, connecting them to each other. Walkways were above the top of the tower, as well as along each arm. Functional parachutes dangled from each of the twelve sub-frames and were held open by metal rings. Each parachute required three cable operators. Riders were belted into two-person canvas seats hanging below the closed parachutes. The parachutes would open as the riders were hoisted to the top of the ride, where release mechanisms would drop them. The parachutes could be stopped at any time during the ascent, but not once they had been released from the top of the tower. The parachutes slowed the rider's descent and the seats would be stopped by a brake after they had fallen to above ground level. Shock absorbers at the bottom, consisting of pole-mounted springs, cushioned the landing. The base consists of a two-story pavilion. The upper floor housed mechanical structures and hoisting machinery, while the ground floor contained ticket booths and a waiting room. The pavilion has six sides divided by fluted piers which slope upward toward the corrugated galvanized-iron roof. The upper floor of the pavilion has red, yellow, and blue walls. The lower floor, below the height of the boardwalk, contained fenced-off open space. The concrete platform surrounding the pavilion is several steps beneath the boardwalk level. It was originally intended as a landing pad for riders and has a radius of . An access ramp was at the northeast corner of the platform. Because of its shape, the Parachute Jump has been nicknamed the \\"Eiffel Tower of Brooklyn\\". The New York Daily News compared the structure to an Erector Set toy, while a writer for City Journal said it resembled a mushroom. Several works of media, such as Little Fugitive (1953), have also been filmed at the Parachute Jump.  Precursors  A parachute tower at the United States Army Airborne School, 2013 By the 1930s, parachutists could be trained by jumping from parachute towers rather than from aircraft. Accordingly, Stanley Switlik and George P. Putnam built a tower on Switlik's farm in Ocean County, New Jersey. The tower, which was designed to train airmen in parachute jumping, was first publicly used on June 2, 1935, when Amelia Earhart jumped from it. The \\"parachute device\\" was patented by retired U.S. Naval Commander James H. Strong along with Switlik, inspired by early practice towers Strong had seen in the Soviet Union, where simple wooden towers had been used to train paratroopers since the 1920s. Strong designed a safer version of the tower, which included eight guide wires in a circle surrounding the parachute. Strong filed a patent in 1935 and built several test platforms at his home in Hightstown, New Jersey, in 1936 and 1937. The military platforms suspended a single rider in a harness and offered a few seconds of free fall after the release at the top before the chutes opened to slow the fall. In response to high civilian interest in trying out the ride, Strong modified his invention for non-military use, making some design changes. These included a seat that could hold two people, a larger parachute for a slower drop, a metal ring to hold it open, and shock-absorbing springs to ease the final landing. The modified amusement-ride version was marketed by Miranda Brothers Inc. as a , two-armed parachute jump. Strong sold military versions of the tower to the Romanian and U.S. armies, as well as installed towers in New Jersey and Fort Benning, Georgia. He also converted an existing observation tower in Chicago's Riverview Park into a six-chute amusement ride. This enterprise, the \\"Pair-O- Chutes\\", performed well enough that Strong applied to build and operate a jump at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Another jump, also reportedly designed by Strong, was installed at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris in 1937.  Operation  = 1939 World's Fair = alt=The Parachute Jump at the World's Fair in 1939 or 1940. Riders in parachutes can be seen descending from the top of the structure.Construction officially began at the 1939 World's Fair in December 1938; it was to be in the Fair's \\"Amusement Zone\\", along the eastern shore of Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, Queens. Life Savers sponsored the ride, investing $15,000 () and decorated its tower with brightly lit, candy-shaped rings. Elwyn E. Seelye & Co. designed the steelwork, Bethlehem Steel manufactured the tower pieces, and Skinner, Cook & Babcock assembled the pieces onsite. Construction cost about $99,000 (). The Jump opened on , a month after the Fair's official opening. It had twelve parachute bays; while five parachutes were operational upon opening, eleven would eventually be used at the Fair. A flagpole was added atop the original tower to surpass the height of a statue within the Soviet Pavilion; the flagpole had been installed because members of the public had objected to the Soviet statue being placed higher than the United States' flag. Each ride cost for adults and for children. The trip to the top took about a minute and the drop took between 10 and 20 seconds. The official 1939 Fair guidebook described the Parachute Jump as \\"one of the most spectacular features of the Amusement Area\\", calling the attraction \\"similar to that which the armies of the world use in early stages of training for actual parachute jumping\\". The Parachute Jump ultimately became the Fair's second-most popular attraction, behind the Billy Rose's Aquacade stage show. Several incidents occurred within the first few months of the Parachute Jump's opening. On July 12, 1939, entangled cables left a married couple aloft for five hours in the middle of the night. The couple returned to ride again the next day, having been congratulated for their courage by New York City mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, who had been at the World's Fair when they got stuck. At least two other groups of people became stuck on the Parachute Jump in its first year: a deputy sheriff and his sister-in-law later in July 1939, and two female friends that September. The Parachute Jump's popularity was negatively affected by its secluded location away from the World's Fair's main entrance. After the Life Savers sponsorship ended at the conclusion of the 1939 season, the ride was relocated closer to the entrance of the New York City Subway's World's Fair station, near the Children's World section of the Fair, at a cost of $88,500 (). An additional chute and new foundations were added. The movement of the Parachute Jump and the consolidation of concessions at that location helped improve business for the World's Fair's 1940 season. The reopening was delayed by disagreements between operator International Parachuting Inc. and James Strong; these disagreements included a lawsuit filed by International Parachuting against Strong to prevent him from selling the rights to the ride to third parties. The Parachute Jump reopened in June 1940, over a month after the Fair's reopening. During the Fair's second operating season, a couple were married on the Parachute Jump in what was described as the first-ever \\"parachute ceremony\\". At the end of the Fair that October, the Parachute Jump was slated to be sent to either Coney Island in Brooklyn or Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. Relocation to Coney Island was considered as early as August 1940; both Luna Park and Steeplechase Park were interested in purchasing the ride during this time. = Steeplechase Park = The Parachute Jump, as seen from directly below Frank Tilyou and George Tilyou Jr., the owners of Steeplechase Park, acquired the Jump for . The park was recovering from a September 1939 fire, which had caused and injured 18 people. The fire had destroyed many of the larger attractions, including a Flying Turns roller coaster, whose site stood empty a year after the blaze. The Parachute Jump was disassembled and moved to the site of the Flying Turns coaster, adjacent to the boardwalk. The ride required some modifications in its new, windier, shore-side location, including the addition of foundations. The relocation was supervised by the engineer Edwin W. Kleinert and architect Michael Mario. Its installation was part of a larger reconstruction of an section of the boardwalk. The Jump reopened in May 1941. Unlimited rides on the Parachute Jump were initially included within Steeplechase Park's single admission fee, which cost at the time of the ride's relocation. Later, the brothers introduced \\"combination tickets\\", which included the park admission fee and a predetermined number of ride experiences on any of the attractions in the park. During World War II, when much of the city was subject to a military blackout, the ride stayed lit to serve as a navigational beacon. The Parachute Jump originally used the multicolored chutes from the World's Fair; however, by the mid-1940s, these had been replaced with white chutes. According to Jim McCollough, a business partner and nephew of the Tilyou brothers, the frame was repainted every year. The Parachute Jump attracted up to half a million riders during each annual operating season. Most riders reached the top of the tower in just under a minute, whereas their descent took 11‚Äì15 seconds. The experience was described as similar to \\"flying in a free fall\\". The Parachute Jump was popular among off-duty military personnel, who took their friends and loved ones to the ride. Occasionally, riders became stuck mid-jump or were tangled within the cables. The ride was subject to shutdowns on windy days, especially when breezes exceeded . Additionally, at least fifteen people were required to operate the Parachute Jump, making it unprofitable. Coney Island's popularity receded during the 1960s as it underwent increased crime, insufficient parking facilities, and patterns of bad weather. These difficulties were exacerbated by competition from the 1964 New York World's Fair, also in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, which led to a record low patronage at Steeplechase Park. On September 20, 1964, Steeplechase Park closed for the last time, and the next year, the property was sold to developer Fred Trump. On the site of Steeplechase Park, Trump proposed building a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center. = Closure = The Parachute Jump stopped operating as part of Steeplechase Park upon the latter's closure in 1964. Sources disagree on whether the ride closed permanently or continued to operate until 1968. The local historian Charles Denson says it closed in 1964, but that many publications give an erroneous date of 1968. The nonprofit organization Coney Island History Project maintains that the attraction closed in 1964 and the 1968 date was based on an inaccurate newspaper article. The Guide to New York City Landmarks also mentions that the ride closed in 1964, while the Brooklyn Paper says the Jump was shuttered in 1965. A New York Daily News article in 1965 said the Parachute Jump was nonoperational and had \\"been stripped of its wires and chutes\\". A New York World-Telegram article the following year described a plan to restore Steeplechase Park, which included turning the Parachute Jump into the \\"world's largest bird feeding station\\". Several sources state the Jump operated until 1968. According to a press release in 1965, when the Parachute Jump was ostensibly still operating, it attracted half a million visitors per year. A Daily News article from 1973 states the ride closed in 1968. Consulting engineer Helen Harrison, as well as the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation's website, also cite a closure date of 1968, saying it was one of several small rides that were operated by concessionaires on the site of Steeplechase Park. According to Harrison, the last documented incident on the ride was on May 30, 1968, when a young girl was reported to have gotten stuck halfway through the drop.  Post-closure  = Acquisition of site = Entrance to abandoned Parachute Jump, 1973; photo by Arthur Tress. \\"Positively No Bumping\\" sign was from its go-kart use. In 1966, the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce petitioned New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to make the Parachute Jump an official city landmark. Trump, however, wanted to sell it as scrap and did not think it was old enough to warrant landmark status. For a time Trump rented out the base area as a concession and it was encircled by a small go-kart track. That October, the city announced a plan to acquire the of the former Steeplechase Park so the land could be reserved for recreational use. The city voted in 1968 to acquire the site for $4 million (equivalent to $million in ). Control of the Jump passed to NYC Parks, the municipal government agency tasked with maintaining recreational facilities in New York City. The agency attempted to sell the Jump at auction in 1971 but received no bids. NYC Parks had planned to demolish the Parachute Jump if no one was willing to buy it. A study conducted in 1972 found the Jump was structurally sound. At the time, there were proposals to give the tower landmark status and install a light show on it. The city attempted to redevelop the Steeplechase site as a state park but this did not occur. By the late 1970s, the city government wanted to build an amusement park on the land. Norman Kaufman, who had run a small collection of fairground amusements on the Steeplechase site since the 1960s, was interested in reopening the Parachute Jump but he was evicted from the site in 1981, ending discussion of that plan. = Landmark status = After it was abandoned, the Jump became a haunt for teenagers and young adults to climb, while the base became covered with graffiti. Despite its deterioration, it remained a focal point of the community; according to local legend, the tower could be seen from up to away. Organizations such as the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce and the Gravesend Historical Society decided to save the structure, though the LPC could not consider such a designation unless NYC Parks indicated it was not interested in developing the Parachute Jump site as a park. In July 1977, the LPC designated the tower a city landmark. Three months later the New York City Board of Estimate declined to certify the landmark designation, citing doubts about the tower's structural integrity. Despite the city's reluctance to designate the structure as a landmark, the Parachute Jump was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Seen from inside MCU Park The city government questioned the tower's safety. A 1982 survey concluded the tower would need a $500,000 renovation to stabilize the ground underneath (equivalent to $million in ) and another $1 million to restore it to operating condition (about $million in ). The survey also estimated it would cost at least $300,000 to demolish the structure (), making demolition too costly an option. The cheapest option, simply maintaining the structure, would have cost $10,000 a year (). NYC Parks commissioner Henry Stern dismissed the possibility of making the Parachute Jump operational again, calling it a \\"totally useless structure\\" and saying that even the Eiffel Tower had a restaurant. Stern said he welcomed the community's proposals for reusing the Parachute Jump but other agency officials said the plans presented thus far, which included turning the Jump into a giant windmill, were \\"quixotic, at best\\". In the mid-1980s, restaurant mogul Horace Bullard proposed rebuilding Steeplechase Park; his plans included making the Parachute Jump operational again. At the time, the Parachute Jump was described as a \\"symbol of despair\\" because no real effort had been made to restore or clean up the structure. In 1987, the LPC hosted meetings to determine the feasibility of granting landmark status to the Parachute Jump, Wonder Wheel, and Coney Island Cyclone. Two years later, on May 23, 1989, the LPC restored city landmark status to the Parachute Jump. Following this, the Board of Estimate granted permission for Bullard to develop his amusement park on the Steeplechase site, including reopening the Parachute Jump. These plans were delayed because of a lack of funds. = Restorations and lighting = In 1991, the city government announced an expenditure to prevent the Jump from collapse, even though there was insufficient funding in the city budget. The city government stabilized the structure in 1993 and painted it in its original colors, although the structure still suffered from rust in the salt air. The thrill-ride company Intamin was enlisted to determine whether the Parachute Jump could again be made operational. Bullard's redevelopment plan clashed with another proposal that would build a sports arena, such as a minor-league baseball stadium, on the site. The Bullard deal was negated in 1994, and the site directly north of the Parachute Jump was developed into a sports stadium, KeySpan Park (later MCU Park), which opened in 2000. The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) assumed responsibility for the tower in 2000. Originally, the city government wanted to reopen it as a functioning ride. However, this plan was abandoned since the cost of bringing the Jump to safety standards would have been excessively high. The planned renovation would have cost , excluding the high insurance premiums that would need to be paid on the attraction.  2002 restoration and first lighting project  Lighting, seen at night A $5 million, 18-month restoration by the NYCEDC started in 2002. The NYCEDC contracted engineering firm STV to rehabilitate the structure. The upper part of the tower was dismantled, about two-thirds of the original structure was taken down, some of it replaced, and the structure was painted red. The restoration was completed around July 2003. Upon the completion of the project, Brooklyn Borough president Marty Markowitz started studying proposals to reuse or reopen the structure. In 2004, STV subcontracted Leni Schwendinger Light Projects to develop a night-time lighting concept for the Parachute Jump. Schwendinger contracted Phoster Industries for the LED portion of the lighting project. Markowitz's office, NYC Parks, the NYCEDC, Schwendinger, and STV collaborated for two years on the project, which cost $1.45 million. The Coney Island Development Corporation and the Van Alen Institute held an architecture contest in 2004 to determine future uses for the pavilion at the Jump's base. More than 800 competitors from 46 countries participated. The results were announced the following year; there were one winning team, two runners-up with cash prizes, and nine honorable mentions. The winning design outlined a bowtie-shaped pavilion with lighting and an all-season activity center, which included a souvenir shop, restaurant, bar, and exhibition space. The first night-time light show was held on July 7, 2006. The installation contained six animations and used most colors except for green, which would not have been visible on the tower's red frame. The animations were based on events in the local calendar, including the boardwalk's operating and non-operating seasons, the lunar cycle, the Coney Island Mermaid Parade, and national holidays such as Memorial Day and Labor Day. There is also a sequence called \\"Kaleidoscope\\" for other holidays. Officials said the lights were to be left on from dusk to midnight during summer and from dusk to 11:00 p.m. the rest of the year. In observance of the \\"Lights Out New York\\" initiative, which sought to reduce bird deaths from light pollution, the tower lighting went dark at 11:00 p.m. during the bird migratory seasons.  2013 restoration and second lighting project  Although Markowitz was initially satisfied with Schwendinger's light installation, by 2007 he was referring to her installation as \\"Phase I\\" of a multi-portion lighting upgrade. In February 2008, the city began planning a second phase of lights. Anti-climbing devices were installed on the Parachute Jump in 2010 after several instances of people scaling the structure, and the lights were temporarily turned off in 2011 because of a lack of maintenance. Concurrently, starting in 2011, the site around the tower was redeveloped as Steeplechase Plaza. A $2 million renovation was completed in 2013, after which it contained 8,000 LED lights, in comparison with the 450 total after the first installation. The B&B; Carousell, an early-20th-century carousel that had become part of Luna Park, was relocated to Steeplechase Plaza east of the Parachute Jump in 2013. The tower was lit up for its first New Year's Eve Ball drop at the end of 2014, and since then, the Parachute Jump has been lit for New Year's Eve each year. The Parachute Jump has also been lit up in recognition of special causes, such as World Autism Awareness Day and Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, as well as to commemorate notable personalities, such as happened after the 2020 death of retired NBA basketball player Kobe Bryant.

The title refers to the three main characters who make a deal with the Devil in order to survive a global epidemic. The plot deals with interwoven stories of persons around the world who are dealing with HIV and AIDS, and stars Shawn Ashmore, Olympia Dukakis, Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing, Chlo√´ Sevigny, and Sandra Oh. The film was screened at various film festivals, and was given a limited release in the United States on December 1, 2006. Plot A group of young men in South Africa, undergo a rite of passage symbolizing their change from boyhood into manhood. In rural China, a heavily pregnant Jin Ping is caught by Chinese military men with crates of black market blood in her van. The blood is destroyed and she is subsequently gang raped. Jin Ping is then shown visiting a village and convincing the inhabitants to give blood for $5 each. They all agree, except Tong Sam, a rice farmer, as he is unable to give blood as he is sick. However, as Jin Ping's equipment is not safe, most of the people in the village contract HIV and die of AIDS, including Tong Sam's family. The military men led by Xuan arrive in the village to help with the disease, and they help Tong Sam grow rice, which he then gives out to his remaining neighbors. Government officials arrive in the town to test people for AIDS, but the testing is $10 per person, which one neighbor thinks is a scam because it \\"cost $5 when she gave me the virus.\\" In Canada, porn star Denys thinks he may be HIV positive. He cheats his monthly blood tests by taking blood samples from his ailing father instead of providing his own blood. Eventually his father dies, and his mother Olive finds out her son's job, much to her dismay. Denys subsequently quits his job. Olive finds out that her son is HIV positive when she goes to meet him at a self-help group. She then decides to infect herself with the HIV virus by drinking Denys's blood, and then gets a substantial pay-off from her health insurance company. She uses the money to provide a better life for her and Denys. One night they go out for dinner, and they are waited on by Maria, a former colleague of Denys. She informs him that she, and several other porn actors, are now infected with HIV because of Denys. She says \\"you killed me for $800\\". In South Africa, where three nuns Clara, Mary, and Hilde arrive at a plantation where they are to give aid. Clara who is very head-strong goes to great lengths to look after the family of a young rape victim, whose grandmother has died, and who is cared for by her older brother. She asks for help from the plantation owner Hallyday, who makes sexual advances on her. Eventually she gives in and allows Hallyday to have sex with her, if he agrees to help the family she looks after. She eventually discovers that the older brother in the family is re-using the plantation's needles, effectively spreading infections amongst the people who live and work there. Following this, three men break into the nuns' bedroom and rape them. The nuns leave the plantation soon after, but as the car pulls away, Clara gets out and walks back to the plantation, removing her habit as she goes. The epilogue is narrated by Hilde, who is revealed to be a Saint and has heard the prayers of everyone from the three stories detailed above. She wonders why the human race will not unite in the face of their common enemy, AIDS, and decides that God, or at least the way people believe in him, is to blame for this failure. Cast Release 3 Needles debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, was also shown at festivals in London, Stockholm, Karlovy Vary, Seattle, and Pusan. It made its commercial release in the United States at the New York City Museum of Modern Art on December 1, 2006 (World AIDS Day). Leading up to its U.S. premier, it was heavily promoted by the United Nations Global Media AIDS Initiative. Critical reception The film won prizes for cinematography and direction at the Atlantic Film Festival.

He was the eldest son of the kingdom's founder King Dongmyeongseong. As with many other early Korean rulers, the events of his life are known largely from the Samguk Sagi.  Reign  Yuri is described as a powerful and militarily successful king. He conquered a Xiongnu tribe in 9 BCE. In 3 BCE, Yuri moved the capital from Jolbon to Gungnae. The Han dynasty was overthrown by Wang Mang, who established the Xin dynasty. In 12 CE Wang Mang sent a messenger to Goguryeo to ask for troops to assist in the conquest of the Xiongnu. Yuri rejected the request and instead attacked Xin.„Ää‰∏âÂõΩÂè≤ËÆ∞„ÄãÔºö‚Äú‰∏âÂçÅ‰∏âÂπ¥ Êò•Ê≠£Êúà Á´ãÁéãÂ≠êÊó†ÊÅ§‰∏∫Â§™Â≠ê Âßî‰ª•ÂÜõÂõΩ‰πã‰∫ã ÁßãÂÖ´Êúà ÁéãÂëΩ‰πå‰ºä„ÉªÊë©Á¶ª È¢ÜÂÖµ‰∫å‰∏á Ë•ø‰ºêÊ¢ÅË≤ä ÁÅ≠ÂÖ∂ÂõΩ ËøõÂÖµË¢≠ÂèñÊ±âÈ´òÂè•‰∏ΩÂéø‚Äù He had six sons and among them were Haemyeong and Muhyul. Haemyeong was proclaimed the crown prince of Goguryeo after the death of Dojeol, who was King Yuri's eldest son. But Yuri found Haemyeong to be too reckless and disobedient. Yuri replaced him with the younger son Muhyul in 14 CE. , Muhyul was Yuri's son with the daughter of Songyang. Muhyul ruled later as King Daemusin of Goguryeo. A poem Yuri was said to have written for his favoured concubine Chihui has survived. It is titled the Hwangjoga ( \\"Song of the Yellow Bird\\").  Succession  King Yuri died in 18 CE, after ruling for 37 years. He was succeeded by his oldest remaining son, Muhyul, who became King Daemusin.

The observations that led to this conclusion were Jumong's early death, the difference in surnames, Yuri's harsh behavior toward some of Jumong's most prized subjects, and the differences in the styles of rule. Jumong died at the age of 40, which is quite early compared to that of some of his successors and predecessors. Very few of the rulers of that time period died before the age of 40. The difference in surnames may signify dynastic change from the Go family to the Hae family. Another startling point to consider is the fact that most of Jumong's most trusted subjects were exiled or resigned. An example is Hyeob-bo, who was among Jumong's first three followers. According to the first Goguryeo volume of the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms (Samguk Sagi), Hyeob-bu disagreed with the way King Yuri continually left the palace to go on hunting trips and strongly urged the King to be more attentive to matters of the kingdom. However, Yuri grew annoyed and forced Hyub-bo to resign from his office. However, this claim may be proven counteracted with the fact that not all of Jumong's subjects were removed. General Bu Bun-no and Oi served Goguryeo through most of King Yuri's reign and played active roles in the kingdom. Goguryeo under Yuri did not display the strict expansionist policy that existed under Jumong. A final observation is the mentioning of a broken sword in the legend. Some historians have inferred that Yuri finding a piece of Jumong's broken sword and using it as a claim signifies the collapse of Jumong's regime, and Yuri's rise to the throne. Overall, the fact that Jumong died five months after the arrival of Yuri caused the suspicion of these select historians. However, this is merely a theory and no assumptions can be made.

Menken-Schaudt later played basketball professionally for eight seasons, including six years in Italy and two in Japan. Menken-Schaudt is a 1993 inductee into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. Biography =Collegiate career= Carol Menken, born in Albany, Oregon, attended and graduated Jefferson High School in Jefferson, Oregon, a small community located in Marion County.Kyle Odegard, \\"Still Standing Tall: and Rooting for OSU,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, March 25, 2016. During her time at the small school Menken was unable to play high school basketball every year as a coach was not always available. Consequently, following her graduation in 1975 Menken was unrecruited and she enrolled on her own at the local Linn- Benton Community College, majoring in graphic arts. Menken was enticed to try out for the Linn-Benton women's basketball team and she became one of just seven players on the club. She approached Oregon State University (OSU) about the possibility of playing collegiately and received a partial scholarship, joining the team for its 1979‚Äì1980 season. The raw young player became a special project for OSU head coach Aki Hill, who helped Menken develop her fundamental skills, including a solid back-to-the-basket game in the low post and smooth turnaround jump shot. Menken's work paid off and she was named a 1981 All-American following her senior year, 1980‚Äì81, during which she led the nation in field goal percentage at .750. Menken still holds Oregon State's career records for points (2,243), rebounds (901), and field goal percentage (.692). She registered double-doubles for points and rebounds in 55 collegiate games and recorded a career scoring high of 51 points. Menken married in 1982, thereafter hyphenating her surname as Menken-Schaudt. =USA basketball= Menken-Schaudt was chosen to represent the USA on the USA Basketball team at the 1981 World University games, held in Bucharest, Romania and coached by Kay Yow. After winning the opening game, the USA was challenged by China, who held a halftime lead. The USA came back to win by two points, helped by 26 points from Denise Curry. The USA also was challenged by Canada, who led at halftime, but the USA won by three points, 79‚Äì76. The USA beat host team Romania, behind 23 points from Menken-Schaudt, to set up a match with undefeated Russia for the gold medal. The Russian team was too strong, and won the gold, leaving the USA with the silver medal. Menken-Schaudt averaged 10.4 points per game. Menken-Schaudt played on the 1983 World University Games team, coached by Jill Hutchison. She averaged 11 points per games, and had a 25-point contribution in the semi-final against Yugoslavia, a game the USA won by only a single point. She helped the team go on to win the gold medal. In 1984, the USA sent its national team to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, for pre-Olympic practice. The team easily beat each of the eight teams they played, winning by an average of just under 50 points per game. Menken-Schaudt averaged 4.1 points per game. =Professional career= Following graduation, Menken-Schaudt played professionally for eight years, logging six seasons in Italy and two more in Japan. She credits playing professionally with helping to extend her playing days, thereby allowing her the opportunity to make the gold medal-winning 1984 American Olympic team. =Legacy= Carol Menken- Schaudt was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Pac-12 Conference Hall of Honor in 2017.

History Total Entertainment Network was the first online gaming provider to go live. Operating out of San Francisco, the service offered PC game players a place to play DOS and Windows-based games online with and against other players, to chat, to download game-related content, and to compete for high scores and to win tournaments. The service was bundled with many PC games and offered as a subscription service. The games supported on TEN include Duke Nukem 3D, NASCAR Racing Online Series, Quake, Command & Conquer, Panzer General, and Big Red Racing. Many online games, especially PC games adapted for online game play, require low and consistent latency to play well. It was a major challenge circa 1996 for consumers to find consistent low latency connections to central servers or to other game players because of the latency intrinsic to dial-up modems and the heavy congestion at the Internet peering points. T E Network, Inc. partnered with Concentric Network Corporation to offer consumers Internet access dial-up numbers that would provide the reliable low latencies they needed to play online games. Concentric optimized their network and their dial-up technology for the TEN service. Concentric also received venture capital financing from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Even with the combined revenues of subscriptions and advertising, TEN remained unprofitable, failing to reach the critical mass numbers of subscribers needed to cover their costs. After the success of Blizzard Entertainment's free Battle.net service for Diablo and their claim that offering online play as a feature of the game boosted retail sales by 10%, PC game publishers started following Blizzard's lead and offering free online game play. This undermined the subscription business model of TEN and their strategy to be the exclusive place to play popular PC games online. As Internet advertising was starting to gain traction, T E Network decided to focus on easy-to-access and easy-to-play browser-based games that would appeal to a broad audience and attract enough unique users to drive an advertising-based business model. T E Network, Inc. became Pogo.com, Inc. to pursue this new strategy.

Optigon Interactive was founded by Daniel Goldman and Janice Linden-Reed in 1991 and launched a beta nationally in 1994 via Sprint's X.25 dial-up network.\\"Showdown at the Virtual Corral,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 5, 1995. Available online at http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/1995/01/05/DD7710.DTL The brand was developed in conjunction with Alan Buder, from Colossal Picture, and Michael Lipscomb. It was an online service with a DOS client that offered Chess, Checkers, SimCity, email, and chat[1]. The entire executive management team Optigon went on to become the executive management team for TE Network, joined by CTO David King from Outland. In 1996 TEN hosted a first of its kind, nationally participated in \\"online tournament\\" rewarding the champions with cash and prizes sparking an immediate surge in online gaming. Some of the first prizes were $500 cash and a lifetime membership to the service. The only Duke tournament was won by one of the first cyber athletes, Christopher S Carpentier, aka \\"Creamator\\", who battled over 14 thousand entries to claim the title of ‚ÄúOne True Duke!‚Äù Most of these newly declared cyber athletes later went on to the PGL \\"Professional Gamers League\\" after TEN converted its business model to Pogo. Organizations like the PGL enhanced the awards, and in 1997 Dennis Fong, also known as Thresh, a professional gamer, won John Carmack's Ferrari at the Red Annihilation tournament. During his career as a professional gamer, it is believed that he made over US$100,000 in endorsements alone.  Closure  TEN shut down in October 1999.

It is the basis for the noted 1964 film Charulata, by Satyajit Ray. Background According to Mary Lago in the introduction to the English translation of Nashtanir (translated by Lago and Supriya Sen), the novella was released three times: in 1901 in serial format, in 1909 as part of a special short story collection, and in 1926 as part of Tagore's standard collection of fiction (p. 9). Scholarship indicates that this story might have been based upon the relationship between Tagore's elder brother Jyotirindranath; his brother's wife, Kadambari Devi (who committed suicide shortly after Tagore's marriage); and Tagore (who spent a great deal of time with Kadambari, reading and writing poetry).Ketaki Kushari Dyson, trans., Rabindranath Tagore, I Won't Let You Go: Selected Poems (London: Penguin, 2011), 68. Plot summary Nastanirh takes place in late 19th-century Bengal and explores the lives of the \\"Bhadralok\\", Bengalis of wealth who were part of the Bengal Renaissance and highly influenced by the Brahmo Samaj. Despite his liberal ideas, Bhupati is blind to the loneliness and dissatisfaction of his wife, Charu. It is only with the appearance of his cousin, Amal, who incites passionate feelings in Charu, that Bhupati realizes what he has lost.

The player assumes the role of the VIXIV starship as it must protect the planet Tetamus II from a mysterious race of aliens. Gameplay involves completing missions assigned by the \\"Training Academy Coach\\", ranging from protecting bases from enemy fire or delivering cargo to a certain area. Notable for being one of the few attempts at a 3D video game on the Game Boy alongside Faceball 2000, X was the creation of Dylan Cuthbert, who would later design the original Star Fox for the Super NES. Commissioned by Argonaut president Jez San after being impressed by the Game Boy at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, Cuthbert and a team of others were forced to reverse-engineer the system due to official development kits being hard to find. It was designed after Argonaut's earlier game Starglider 2 for the Amiga. Nintendo grew interested in the game during production and convinced Cuthbert and Argonaut to make it a first-party title for the console. A planned North American release named Lunar Chase was cancelled as Nintendo of America felt a game of its type was too advanced for a console meant for children. X initially received mixed reviews from critics, often being praised for its impressive technological accomplishments but criticized for its high difficulty. Retrospectively, it was acclaimed for its historical importance and gameplay, often being compared to games such as Star Luster. The 1992 Game Boy cartridge is considered to be one of the most difficult game cartridges to find. A DSiWare sequel, X-Scape, was released worldwide in 2010. Gameplay Translation: \\"Move the + [cross] button [control pad] up and down to control your speed!\\" X is a first-person space combat simulator video game, being one of the few Game Boy games to use 3D visuals. Controlling the starship VIXIV, the player is tasked with completing missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach to protect the planet Tetamus II from being taken over by a mysterious alien race. The VIXIV must complete each of the game's ten stages, referred in-game as \\"objectives\\", under a time limit. Objectives range from protecting a base from enemy fire, delivering a load of cargo to a certain area, or shooting down formations of enemies. The VIXIV can fast- travel to other parts of the map by entering large openings found in certain places, with gameplay taking place in a long series of tunnels. Completing objectives awards the player stars, and up to ten can be awarded. A certain number of stars is required to finish each mission, and should the player fail to earn enough will be forced to restart the mission. The VIXIV has a radar at the bottom of the screen that displays the player's current location and any nearby enemies or objectives. The player can find large openings on the ground in certain areas of the game, which can allow the VIXIV to fast-travel to other sections of the map. The game ends once ten missions are completed. Development X was designed by Dylan Cuthbert of Argonaut Games, who would later produce Star Fox for the SNES. After being intrigued by the Game Boy's during the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, Argonaut president Jez San commissioned Cuthbert to produce a 3D engine for the console and potentially create a game utilizing it. Cuthbert and his development team had to reverse- engineer the Game Boy hardware as official Nintendo development kits were hard to come by, and that Argonaut was virtually unknown to them. A dummy developer kit was produced with a camera pointing at the system, produced by dismantling the console itself with a Tetris cartridge inserted and connecting it to a board made by another Argonaut employee. Cuthbert began work on X once he became familiar with the hardware; he was responsible for creating some of the graphics, most of the game design, and all of the programming. The game was created in the style of Argonaut's older computer games, notably Starglider 2, featuring full 360-degree movement through space. Its technological accomplishments quickly caught the eye of a Nintendo employee, who urged that they send a ROM of the game to Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto, Japan. It was presented to both Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi and engineer Ishuna, who were \\"blown away\\" by its usage of 3D wireframe graphics, requesting that Dylan and his team fly over to Japan and meet them. After being shown to other employees, Nintendo became so impressed with the game that they purchased the rights to it from the original publisher, Mindscape, and made Argonaut an official third-party licensee. Assisting development was Nintendo Research and Development 1 (R&D1;), the division responsible for producing the Game Boy itself. The soundtrack was composed by Kazumi Totaka, and is the first game to feature the infamous \\"Totaka's Song\\". At first, the title was named Eclipse, but then-Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi insisted upon it being renamed X, calling up director Yoshio Sakamoto a month before development was completed. Nintendo forced Cuthbert and Argonaut to rewrite the 3D engine entirely due to a game-breaking bug that made it unplayable on certain Game Boy systems, due to the company's strict stance on quality. X was released in Japan on May 29, 1992. A North American version titled Lunar Chase was completed by Cuthbert; however, Nintendo of America felt that the idea of a 3D first-person game on a handheld for children was too complicated, and (to his disappointment) cancelled its release. Cuthbert believed that a lack of interest from retailers was also to blame. In a 2018 interview with USgamer, Cuthbert admitted that he lost the source code for Lunar Chase and didn't think to make a backup copy at the time. An official ROM image of the complete English translation of Lunar Chase was unearthed in the 2020 Nintendo data leak. A nearly-finished fan translation was also released online the same day as the official English translation was leaked. Reception Early reviews for X were mixed, with many praising its technological accomplishments on the system but criticizing its high difficulty. Famitsu magazine compared the game to Star Luster, being impressed by the game's 3D wireframe technology and sense of realism, while criticizing its difficulty for being too hard for beginners especially. Family Computer Magazine had a similar response, saying that it could drive away potential players with its high difficulty level, while simultaneously praising its 3D gameplay and soundtrack, claiming that it could easily be brought over to the Super Famicom with the addition of color and newer features. Nintendo Power staff was impressed by the technical capabilities of the game, comparing the visuals to the virtual reality BattleTech Center in Chicago, calling it one of the most exciting Nintendo titles. Joypad Magazine staff meanwhile found it to be an interesting game, praising it for being so different compared to other Game Boy games. In retrospect, X has been cited as a landmark title in the Game Boy's lifespan for its usage of 3D wireframe graphics. Polygon listed it as the 30th greatest Game Boy game of all time for being a \\"tour-de-force of Game Boy technical prowess\\", highly praising its 3D visuals and free-range movement. They also stated that its technological feats alone made the game worth owning. Writer Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica felt similarly on its technical prowess, calling it \\"incredible\\" and lamenting that it was never released in English. Writer Jeremy Parish stated that X was a more impressive creation than Star Fox for not requiring any additional hardware and for being made on the Game Boy, praising its 3D graphics and its more ambitious design compared to Star Fox. Simultaneously, he criticized the game's lack of variety in combat and for several missions being drawn out and repetitive. He concluded his review by saying the game was worth owning for its historical importance and technological accomplishments. He expressed a desire to see it resurrected through a hypothetical Game Boy Mini platform. The book Nostalgia GB Perfect Guide! cited it as an important title in the console's history, saying that it helped pave the way for Argonaut's later game, Star Fox. They recommended the game to fans of similar games such as Star Luster, praising its slow-paced gameplay and soundtrack.

The book, published in 1863, depicts a group of people at the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts as each tells a story in the form of a poem. Overview The poems in the collection are told by a group of adults in the tavern of the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts, 20 miles from the poet's home in Cambridge, and a favorite resort for parties from Harvard College. The narrators are friends of the author who, though they were not named, were so plainly characterized as to be easily recognizable. Among those of wider fame are Ole Bull, the violinist, and Thomas William Parsons, the poet and translator of Dante. Each of the three parts has a prelude and a finale, and there are interludes which link together the tales and introduce the narrators. The prelude for the first part begins: \\"One Autumn night, in Sudbury town, Across the meadows bare and brown, The windows of the wayside inn Gleamed red with fire-light...\\" Composition and publication history Sign for Longfellow's Wayside Inn, where the collection takes place Longfellow undertook the large-scale project in part to combat grief over the death of his wife Fanny in 1861.Knight, Denise.

History It was for some years the world's leading centre for tea and spice trading after the British East India Company successfully took over all trading ports from the Dutch East India Company in 1799. It was the centre of the British opium business (comprising 90% of all transactions), as well as other drugs in the 18th century. Businesses in the British slave trade, such as Hibbert, Purrier and Horton (founded 1770), were also based in Mincing Lane. It is mentioned in chapter 16 of Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, where it is briefly described: :\\"[Bella] arrived in the drug-flavoured region of Mincing Lane, with the sensation of having just opened a drawer in a chemist's shop.\\" It was mentioned by Round the Horne radio show scriptwriters, who regularly used the proper noun word 'Mincing' in the Polari-Adjectival sense, meaning an effeminate, male gait. In 1834, when the East India Company ceased to be a commercial enterprise, and tea became a 'free trade' commodity, tea auctions were held in the London Commercial Salerooms on Mincing Lane. Tea merchants established offices in and around the street, earning it the nickname 'Street of Tea'.Tea Council A notable building is the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. The current building, opened in 1958, is the sixth to stand on the site; the fourth was burnt down in the Great Fire of London and the fifth was destroyed during the Blitz of World War II.Old London Maps A modern landmark partly bounded by Mincing Lane is Plantation Place, completed in 2004, and its sister building Plantation Place South.

The word jugalbandi means, literally, \\"entwined twins.\\" The duet can be either vocal or instrumental. Often, the musicians will play different instruments, as for example the famous duets between sitarist Ravi Shankar and sarod player Ali Akbar Khan, who played the format since the 1940s. More rarely, the musicians (either vocalists or instrumentalists) may be from different traditions (i.e. Carnatic and Hindustani). What defines jugalbandi is that the two soloists be on an equal footing. A performance can only truly be deemed a jugalbandi, if both musicians are neither sole soloist nor solely accompanying. In jugalbandi, both musicians act as lead players, and a playful competition exists between the two performers.  Hindustani- Karnatic Jugalbandi  Jugalbandi of Hindustani and Karnatic styles has evolved into a relatively common pattern that has the Hindustani artist accompanied by a tabla artist, and the Carnatic artist accompanied by a mridangam artist, and possibly also accompanied by tambura. The main artists from each tradition present a composition in their own style and then together collaborate and present a common piece. The common piece is usually in a raga that is common to both traditions, such as Yaman-Kalyani, Bhairavi- Sindhubhairavi, Keeravani.  Jasrangi  Jasrangi is a novel form of Jugalbandi. Pandit Jasraj is credited as the inventor of this new form of Jugalbandi. In Jasrangi Jugalbandi a male and a female vocalist sing two different ragas at the same time in two different scales, based on the Moorchhana principle of Indian classical music. The two singers give prominence to the Shadja-Madhyam and Shadja-Pancham Bhav, with the ‚Äòma‚Äô note of the female voice becoming the ‚Äòsa‚Äô of the male voice, and the male ‚Äòpa‚Äô becoming the female ‚Äòsa‚Äô. Since both the singers sing in their own pitch the tonal quality in the music is not lost. http://www.thehindu.com/features/november-fest/sanjeev-abhyankar-ashwini- bhide-deshpande-at-friday-review-november-fest-2014/article6522606.ece  References  Indian classical music Instrumental duets Hindustani music performance Hindustani music terminology ","title":"Jugalbandi"},{"id":"5029269","text":"Amore scusami is an album by Dalida, released in December 1964.

This may occur accidentally or deliberately. The total number of spoilt votes in a United States election has been called the residual vote.Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, Residual Votes Attributable to Technology: An Assessment of the Reliability of Existing Voting Equipment, version 2, 3 Mar. 2001, http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~voting/Caltech_MIT_Report_Version2.pdf In Australia, such votes are generally referred to as informal votes, and in Canada they are referred to as rejected votes. In some jurisdictions spoilt votes are counted and reported. Types of spoilt vote  A ballot may be spoilt in a number of ways, including: * Failing to mark the ballot at all (blank vote), or otherwise defacing the ballot instead of attempting to vote. * Filling out the ballot in a manner that is incompatible with the voting system being used, e.g.: ** Marking more choices than permitted (overvoting), or fewer than necessary (undervoting). ** Filling a preference ballot out of sequence, e.g. 1-2-2-3-4 or 1-2-4-5-6, 1-4-2-4-5. In most cases, only the first two choices in these examples would be counted as valid. ** Adding a write-in candidate when such an option is not permitted. The vote for this candidate would be discarded. * Filling the ballot in a manner that makes the voter's decision unclear. * Physically deforming ballots, especially those counted by machine. * Making marks on the ballot other than those necessary to complete it, from which the voter's identity can be ascertained, compromising the secrecy of the ballot. As an example, UK law specifically precludes ballots \\"on which votes are given for more candidates than the voter is entitled to vote for\\", \\"on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified\\" or \\"which [are] unmarked or void for uncertainty\\". Replacement ballots If a voter makes a mistake while completing a ballot, it may be possible to cancel it and start the voting process again. In the United States, cancelled physical ballots may be called \\"spoiled ballots\\",See, for example, Kentucky Revised Statutes 117.385, effective July 15, 1982 as distinct from an \\"invalid vote\\" which has been cast. In Canada, a spoiled ballot is one that has been handled by an elector in such a manner that it is ruined beyond use, or that the deputy returning officer finds soiled or improperly printed. The spoilt ballot is not placed in the ballot box, but rather is marked as spoilt by the deputy returning officer and set aside. The elector is given another ballot. A 'rejected ballot' is one which cannot be counted due to improper marking by the voter. Examples of this are ballots which have more than one mark, the intent of the voter cannot be ascertained, or the voter can be identified by their mark. In many jurisdictions, if multiple elections or referendums are held simultaneously, then there may be separate physical ballots for each, which may be printed on different-colored paper and posted into separate ballot boxes. In the United States, a single physical ballot is often used to record multiple separate votes. In such cases one can distinguish an \\"invalid ballot\\", where all votes on the ballot are rendered invalid,See, for example, Determining the Validity of Optical Scan Ballot Markings, Michigan Bureau of Elections, May 27, 2004. from a \\"partially valid\\" ballot, with some votes are valid and others invalid. Intentional spoiling A voter may deliberately spoil a vote, for example as a protest vote, especially in compulsory voting jurisdictions, to show disapproval of the candidates standing whilst still taking part in the electoral process. Intentionally spoiling someone else's ballot before or during tabulation is an electoral fraud. The validity of an election may be questioned if there is an unusually high proportion of spoilt votes. In multiple-vote U.S. ballots, \\"voter roll-off\\" is calculated by subtracting the number of votes cast for a \\"down-ballot\\" office, such as mayor, from the number of votes cast for a \\"top- of-the-ballot\\" office, such as president. When the election jurisdiction does not report voter turnout, roll-off can be used as a proxy for residual votes. Some voters may only be interested in voting for the major offices, and not bother filling in the lower positions, resulting in a partially valid ballot. While it is not illegal to advocate informal voting in Australian federal elections, it was briefly illegal to advise voters to fill out their ballots using duplicated numbers. Albert Langer was jailed for violating an injunction not to advocate incomplete preference voting for the 1996 Australian federal election. Unintentional spoiling Voter instructions are usually intended to minimize the accidental spoiling of votes. Ballot design can aid or inhibit clarity in an election, resulting in less or more accidental spoiling. Some election officials have discretion to allow ballots where the criteria for acceptability are not strictly met but the voter's intention is clear. More complicated electoral systems may be more prone to errors. Group voting tickets were introduced in Australia owing to the high number of informal votes cast in single transferable vote (STV) elections. When multiple Irish STV elections are simultaneous (as for local and European elections) some voters have marked, say, 1-2-3 on one ballot paper and 4-5-6 on the other; some returning officers consequently allowed 4-5-6 ballots to be counted, until a Supreme Court case in 2015 ruled they were invalid. The United States Election Assistance Commission's survey of the 2006 midterm elections reported undervoting rate of 0.1% in US Senate elections and 1.6% in US House elections; overvotes were much rarer. Some paper-based voting systems and most DRE voting machines can notify voters of under-votes and over-votes. The Help America Vote Act requires that voters are informed when they have overvoted, unless a paper-ballot voting system is in use.Help America Vote Act Section 301(a)1(A)(iii) See also *Election fraud *Ballot design in the Single Transferable Vote: discusses exhausted votes, which cannot be transferred owing to too few preferences being expressed *Refused ballot References Voting theory Protest tactics Elections terminology ","title":"Spoilt vote"},{"id":"5029319","text":"Pinball Number Count (or Pinball Countdown) is a collective title referring to 11 one-minute animated segments on the PBS children's series Sesame Street that teach children to count to 12 by following the journey of a pinball through a rather fanciful pinball machine. These segments are notable for the colorful, imaginative animation as well as the funky soundtrack with vocals by The Pointer Sisters. Pinball Number Count was originally produced in 1976 by Imagination, Inc. in San Francisco, California for the Children's Television Workshop. It made its debut on Sesame Street in 1977. Overview The Pinball Number Count segments contain common beginning and ending sequences showing the launch of the pinball into the machine and the exit of the pinball from play, respectively. Between these two sequences is a number-specific animated narrative showing the pinball in play. This middle segment features a scene in which a number of contraptions move the pinball about the interior of the machine. Each scene begins with the ball following ramps and hitting some bumpers, then various features belonging to a theme specific to the number. The pinball then exits this area to the end sequence, where it leaves play. Opening sequence At the beginning of each segment, we see a number with a group of stars circling around it. We hear a voice whispering the current number. Music Music for Pinball Number Count was composed by Walt Kraemer and arranged by Ed Bogas. Performers included The Pointer Sisters on vocals and assorted San Francisco Bay Area jazz musicians, including Mel Martin on saxophone and Andy Narell on steel drums. The arrangements reflect musical idioms commonly found in 1970s urban culture, predominantly funk and jazz, though other styles including Caribbean music are also represented. The number-specific middle sections contain one of three different improvised instrumental solos over a basic progression, featuring steel drums (numbers 2, 4, 9 and 12) electric guitar (3, 8 and 11) and soprano saxophone (5, 6, 7 and 10). Consistent with an abbreviated jazz structure, a prearranged head and turnaround / coda are played during the common starting and ending animation sequences. The vocals work in similar fashion with the featured numeral spoken, sung and shouted during the middle section and a return to the arranged counting at the end. The song employs complex rhythms, changing time signatures frequently between 4/4, 3/4 and 5/4 during the opening and closing segments, around a rhythmically straightforward 4/4 middle improvisation section. Visuals Animation for the segments was directed by Jeff Hale and recalls contemporary psychedelic and pop art styles, typified by the ornate pinball bumpers, colorful geometrical motifs and whimsical themes and devices inside the machine. List of segments Despite the lyrics' counting from one to twelve, Pinball Number Count did not feature a segment for the number 1. * #2: A Day at the Carnival The ball finds its way through carnival and amusement park-themed obstacles‚Äîriding a roller coaster, a ferris wheel, and some hanging airplanes until being dropped into a giant clown heads's mouth that leads to a haunted house ride. It passes by a ghost, a skeleton, and a bat (which zooms toward the camera), before exiting another giant clown head's mouth. Now it runs over a balloon man, goes through a ball toss, gets rejected from a duck game by a windmill, then is bounced into the hole by two bumper cars. * Solo: Steel Drum * #3: Circus Capers The ball rolls through circus attractions. It is shot from a blue cannon (flowers pop out), bounces off a net held by two clowns, and handed off by a ringmaster to a juggling monkey who tosses it to a lion tamer and her lion, who throws it through the hoop. The ball then gets tossed and it lands on the nose of a blue seal and is launched from a seesaw by a hippopotamus to a pink elephant that runs it into the hole. Number 3 is the only segment that features four flashes of its number instead of three. * Solo: Electric Guitar * #4: FORE! The ball rolls down a hill and is hit by a golfer. It crashes into a duck and it spins. The golfer gives the ball another shot. It then runs over another golfer with a flag standing next to a hole before entering a rabbit burrow (causing six purple rabbits to pop out of their holes). The golfer makes the last shot. The ball bumps off the bottoms of four trees before rolling into another tree where a squirrel drops it into the hole. * Solo: Steel Drum * #5: The Only Way to Travel The ball rolls down a ramp and is kicked by a flagman into the backseat of a car which enters a tunnel, from which emerges a bicycle with the ball in its basket. The ball is then pushed by a train, then a magnet attached to a plane picks it up and drops it into a tugboat, causing it to sink. After the ball is shot out of a volcano, it is caught by a blimp, which drops it into the hole. * Solo: Saxophone * #6: Down on the Farm The ball rolls down a ramp attached to a barn and is kicked by a donkey past a group of sheep before rolling into the bottom of a haystack. It emerges from the top and is tossed by a goat dressed like a farmer. Now it rolls under a group of chicks and is laid like an egg under a mother hen who then pushes it away with its beak. The ball now rolls into a doghouse and is chased out by the dog inside. It then chases a pig into a barn where the goat farmer emerges from behind it carrying the ball in a wheelbarrow and drops it into the hole. * Solo: Saxophone * #7: World Tour The ball slides down from the roofs of the Taj Mahal and under a snake charmer whose pet snake is startled awake and pushes the ball out from under him with its tail. The ball rolls under the Sphinx (the statue turns its head to see the ball as it rolls behind him), and into the pyramid of Khafre. The ball leaves the pyramid from the top and bounces off two onion domes before being kicked into the air by a Russian hopak dancer. A Swiss-mountain climber blowing a alphorn swings to the right to catch the ball. Then he swings to the left and blows the ball loose. The ball lands on a bull in a ring, bounces off him and crashes into a matador. It then gets rejected by a Kinderdijk windmill, runs over a constable and enters a sentry box which causes two British guards to pop out of their holes. Number 7 is the only segment where the ball doesn't enter a hole at the end of the segment. * Solo: Saxophone * #8: Forest Follies Many forest animals pass the ball around. A unicycling teddy bear, a frog, a monkey, a pelican, a kangaroo, a gopher, a second brown bear in a tree, two more unicycling brown bears, and a unicycling raccoon who drops it into the hole. Number 8 is the only segment where the ball doesn't enter the scene immediately. * Solo: Electric Guitar * #9: Play Ball! The ball rolls down a ramp and encounters some baseball players, runs over a hot-dog vendor, and is chased under the bleachers and dropped into the hole by a dog. Number 9 only features two flashes of its number instead of three. * Solo: Steel Drum * #10: Medieval Times The ball slides down a ramp attached to a castle wall and is launched from a catapult by a jester and a knight into the mouth of a dragon who spits it out with fire, sending the ball crashing into another knight. It then runs into a giant who pushes the ball on with its spiky flail. The ball then rolls into a castle through the doorway as the bridge lowers, then it is shot from a cannon into the cave, and splashes into a witch's cauldron. The dragon then emerges from the cauldron with the ball in its mouth and drops it into the hole. * Solo: Saxophone * #11: Wild Things Many jungle animals pass the ball around, including a monkey, an elephant, a giraffe, a jaguar, a rhinoceros, a zebra, a lion, a hare, a tiger, and a gorilla that flicks it into the hole. * Solo: Electric Guitar * #12: Sightseeing USA The ball goes sightseeing through American landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon, Old Faithful, a Sequoia, the Golden Gate Bridge, and a San Francisco Trolley which drops it into the hole. * Solo: Steel Drum Cover versions and parodies Pinball Number Count has been covered and remixed by a number of artists. One such version, done with the cooperation of Sesame Workshop, was released under the DJ Food name by Ninja Tune Records on a 12\\" EP and the Zen TV DVD. Other versions have been performed by Venetian Snares (on the Infolepsy EP), Wicked Hemlocks, The Postmarks and an instrumental version by Big Organ Trio. The refrain was prominently featured in Many Moons by Janelle Mon√°e. It was covered by Brandon Williams on his 2014 album 'XII' featuring Dames Brown & Nicholas Payton. The Family Guy episode \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz\\" used a plastic bubble-encased Stewie as the pinball in a close parody of the segment. The Pointer Sisters' distinctive counting style in particular is also referenced near the start of the film Half Nelson, where Ryan Gosling's character Dan Dunne mumbles the numbers in the same fashion. Appearances in other media The song is featured in the 2015 compilation album, This Record Belongs To....

Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Lobnya Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #11/2013-OZ As a municipal division, Lobnya Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Lobnya Urban Okrug.Law #21/2005-OZ Architecture The environs are rich in architectural monuments, such as the Neo-Gothic estate of Marfino located to the northeast, which was laid out by Field Marshal Pyotr Saltykov in the 1770s but was extensively modernized by Count Panin in 1837‚Äì1839. The palace is Gothic in style, scored to resemble a medieval castle; a flight of stairs connects it with a white-stone wharf by the river, decorated with statues of griffins. To the west from the palace stands the Petrine Baroque church of the Virgin's Nativity (1701‚Äì1707). There are also a Gothic bridge, stables, and two English parks with picturesque rotundas. Within two kilometers from Marfino is the manor of Nikolskoye- Prozorovskoye, which contains a Neo-Baroque country house of Field Marshal Prozorovsky and a Neoclassical church of St. Nicholas, built in the 1790s. Nearby is Rozhdestveno-Suvorovo, where the five-domed church of the Virgin's Nativity was built by Princes Baryatinsky at the turn of the 18th century. In 1773, the estate passed to Alexander Suvorov's father, Vasily Suvorov, a general-in-chief who is buried in the church. The oldest building in the vicinity is the five-domed four-pillared apseless Trinity Church in Chashnikovo (four kilometers from Lobnya). Its elegant Italianate decor, reminiscent of the Chudov Monastery cathedral, dates the church to the early years of the 16th century, when such Italian architects as Aloisio the New were active in Russia. The church was first documented in 1585, when Chashnikovo was owned by Nikita Romanov, grandfather of Tsar Mikhail I. By the end of the 17th century, the estate had passed to Lev Naryshkin, maternal uncle of Peter the Great, who added a bell tower and had the church's decor updated to answer his own Naryshkin Baroque tastes. Other well-known villages in the vicinity of Lobnya are Zhostovo (seven kilometers to the northeast) and Fedoskino (ten kilometers to the east), renowned for their traditional folk crafts of Zhostovo painting and Fedoskino miniature, respectively.

Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed December 5, 2015. She studied flute and piano at the Conservatory of Music in Freiburg, West Germany from 1966 - 1968 and moved to Canada in 1975. She received a Bachelor of Music from the University of British Columbia in 1972 and a Masters in Arts from Simon Fraser University in 1988. She taught acoustic communication at Simon Fraser University from 1982 - 1991. Biography In 1972, she married the Canadian poet and playwright Norbert Ruebsaat and has collaborated with him on a number of projects. = Music = Many of her compositions deal with the acoustic environment and she often incorporates the medium of tape in conjunction with live instruments or voices, combining, manipulating and processing environmental sounds. She has been influenced by studying the works of composers like Pauline Oliveros, John Cage and Barry Truax.  1973-91  From 1973-80 Westerkamp worked as a research associate along with R. Murray Schafer at the World Soundscape Project at Simon Fraser University. This work fed into Schafer's book The Tuning of the World. In 1974 she began working as a producer and host at CFRO (Vancouver Cooperative Radio). Through her work with Shafer and with radio, she developed a deep interest and concern for noise and the acoustic environment, which greatly influenced her style of composition. After this time, she began to experiment with recording, processing, and mixing environmental sounds in the recording studio. Westerkamp was involved in several other research projects on noise, acoustic ecology and music. From 1974 - 1975, she was a researcher with the Noise Abatement Project of the Society Promoting Environmental Conservation in Vancouver. In 1982, she was a researcher for the Women in Music project at Simon Fraser University. She is also a founding member of the World Forum on Acoustic Ecology (WFAE). In the 1980s, she developed an interest in music for live performance, and in creating installations and other \\"composed environments\\" (sometimes in collaboration) for specific sites.  After 1991  After 1991, Westerkamp devoted herself to more fully to composing, lecturing, and writing, disseminating her compositions and ideas at concerts and conferences. She was editor of The Soundscape Newsletter from 1991 - 1995 and joined the editorial committee of Soundscape: The Journal of Acoustic Ecology, for the World Forum for Acoustic Ecology in 2000. She has also composed soundtracks for radio dramas and film and her music has been featured in movies by Gus Van Sant including Elephant (2003) and Last Days (2005). She collaborated with Jesse Zubot on the electronic score for Koneline (2016).

Population: 50,200 (1970). History The exact date of Reutov's foundation is unknown; however, most historians believe that it was founded between 1492 and 1495. In the 17th-18th centuries, the village of Reutovo belonged to the dynasties of Prince Turenin and Prince Vasily Dolgorukov. At the beginning of the 18th century, Reutovo became a village. Census Book of 1709 has a record of the village of Reutovo, owned by the Prince Vasily Dolgorukov. In 1787, the village was acquired by Prince N. I. Maslov. Under his rule Reutovo became a luxurious country estate. At the beginning of the 19th century, Prince Maslov went bankrupt and the village became a property of Lt. Col. A. M. Pokhvistnev who in 1824 built a cotton mill. Yarn from the factory was among the best in Russia and won a gold medal at the All-Russian National Show in 1831. Shortly after that Pokhvistnev sold the land and the mill. In 1843, the land and the cotton mill was purchased by S. A. Mazurin, a Moscow merchant. He built a brick factory, dormitories, and restructured the cotton mill gradually forming a factory town of Reutovo. Since 1955, Reutov is the host for NPO Mashinostroyeniya, formerly known as USSR Experimental Design Bureau #52, where development of various robotic and manned space satellites, ICBMs, cruise missiles takes place; the longtime director was Vladimir Chelomey. The town is separated from Moscow by the Moscow Ring Road and Nosovikhinskoye Highway. Reutov has the status of a science-town (naukograd) and celebrates its anniversary on the last Saturday of September.

Its members are drawn from the Council of Senior Scholars, of which it is a committee, and consist of the most senior Sunni scholars of fiqh in Saudi Arabia, including the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia as its head. The issuance of fataawa in Saudi Arabia is limited to members of the Council of Senior Scholars and a few other clerics. Establishment The committee was established along with the Council of Senior Scholars by royal decree on August 29, 1971 (8th of Rajab 1391 AH) by King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia.Islamopedia: \\"Standing Committee for Scholarly Research and Issuing Fatwas, (Saudi Arabia)\\" retrieved from archive.org March 13, 2014 Under section four of the decree, it stated, > ‚ÄúThe Permanent Committee has been left the task of selecting its members > from amongst the members of the Council (of Senior Scholars) in accordance > with the Royal Decree.

It will be called: The > Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawa (al-Lajnah ad-Daa'imah > lil-Buhooth al-'Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa.)‚Äù It is possible to write to the Permanent Committee asking for a fatwa on a specific topic. Since its inception, the Permanent Committee has replied to Muslims not only in Saudi Arabia but in many other countries, seeking rulings in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) on a variety of questions, including Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad), Ibadah (worship), and Aqeedah (Islamic creed) issues. In their fataawa, the Permanent Committee strive for thoroughness. All fataawa are derived from evidence from the three sources of Islamic knowledge: the Qur'an, authentic Sunnah, and understanding of the rightly guided companions of the Prophet Muhammad. The fataawa writers will usually explain all the potential Islamic viewpoints of an issue and will then explain, which in their view is the most authentic opinion based on the evidence. The fatwas issued by the committee have been arranged in a compendium of 32 volumes. Authority In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars would be allowed to issue fatwas in Saudi Arabia, namely the 21 member Council of Senior Scholars, the country's highest religious body, and the (four or five) member Permanent Committee, whose members are drawn from the Council of Senior Scholars.Carnegie Endowment: \\"Saudi Fatwa Restrictions and the State-Clerical Relationship\\" by Christopher Boucek October 27, 2010 A new committee affiliated with the Permanent Committee and headed by one Saleh bin Mohammed al-Luhaydan was created by the Council of Senior Scholars to supervise the issuance of fatwas and prevent unauthorized scholars from issuing any.

It is commonly served as banchan (a side dish accompanying rice) as well as anju (food accompanying alcoholic drinks). In post-war Korea, from the mid to late-20th century, memil-muk along with chapssal-tteok (glutinous rice cakes) was widely served as yasik (late-night snack) by street vendors. In modern times, it is popular as a diet food. Along with other buckwheat dishes, it is a local specialty of Gangwon Province, especially Bongpyeong Township in Pyeongchang County.  Preparation  Unhulled whole buckwheat grains are soaked in water (to reduce bitterness). Soaked grains are then ground in maetdol (millstone) and sieved. The skins are discarded, and the remaining liquid is set aside to allow it to separate into layers. The upper layer, consisting of clear water, is discarded. The lower layer, consisting of settled buckwheat starch, is boiled with constant stirring. When cooled, the mixture sets to form a jelly-like substance, muk. Memil-muk is most commonly eaten as memil-muk-muchim (; \\"buckwheat jelly salad\\"), a banchan (side dish) in which chunks of memil-muk are mixed with chopped kimchi, ground toasted sesame seeds and soy sauce. In Gangwon Province, memil-muk is used in jesa (ancestral rites) for deceased ancestors. In summer, memil-muk-sabal (; \\"cold buckwheat jelly soup\\") is made with cold kimchi broth, while in winter, memil-muk is served in hot jangguk (soy sauce-based beef broth). In Yeongju, some houses are still made in the traditional way and eat Muk-bap(Î¨µÎ∞•).  In folklore  In ancient times, memil-muk was thought to be irresistible to dokkaebi (Korean goblins). Memil-muk is offered in dokkaebi-gut, a gut (shamanistic ritual performed by a mu shaman) for chasing away dokkaebi, which were believed to be the causes of contagious diseases. Other rituals with similar purpose, such as dokkaebi-je, a jesa (Confucian ritual, held in households), and dokkaebi-gosa, a gosa (shamanistic or Buddhist household ritual, held in households), also include the offering of memil-muk.  In popular culture  In the manhwa Dokebi Bride, the use of memil-muk to call on dokebi is an important plot device.

It aired on ITV from 28 November to 14 December 2001. Plot The show follows Mildred Hubble (Georgina Sherrington) in her first year at Weirdsister College, a university for students of magic. Similar to her adventures at Cackle's, Mildred usually messes up, but saves the day in the end. The series has a darker side than The Worst Witch, with evil creatures and a possible doomsday. The College Weirdsister College in Cambridge is an institution where successful students from magical academies and institutes of Great Britain can further their magical education, and where qualified doctors and professors can teach and (along with the students) push the boundaries of magic with experiments. The college has many age-old traditions and legends, such as 'The Agonies' the games held once a year, the prize is possession of The Golden Cauldron, a highly magical artefact, but the winner can only have it for one night. Nearby, and owned by the College, is Misery's cafe. This is the local hangout for the main characters, and is also the site of Jazz concerts (in which one character, Thunderblast, plays the trombone). Some students had saved the cafe from closure by 'meddling' with time. Also in the town is Jenny Wendle's studio, where meditation classes are held. The College is a highly magical building, and with so many spells and magical demonstrations being performed, the Foster's effect would destroy the building, so The Bus Spell covers the building and its grounds. This means that every Friday the college has no magic performed in it, or strange events may happen and chaos will rule. Characters and cast =The Staff= *Professor Alicia Thunderblast (Charmian May) ‚Äì the director of the College. Experienced witch, trombone player and almost as partial to cakes as Miss Cackle. *Dr. Claire Wendle (Jaye Griffiths) ‚Äì An experienced first year tutor, and Millie's mentor. Runs the Witches Practice in town and her knowledge is needed to help save the College. *Dr. Andy Starfinder (Eric Loren) ‚Äì An American wizard who looks to broaden the boundaries of magic with science and his inventions. Got himself into trouble with Beetle on his 2nd day, by performing magic on a Friday which broke the Bus Spell. *Professor Johnathan Shakeshaft (John Rogan) ‚Äì The oldest member of staff, teaches (and forgets) various types of magic but spends most of his time asleep. Rumours about him are that he is mad and that he is from medieval times. *Veronica Dewdrop (Jenny Galloway) ‚Äì 'The Beetle', as the students know her. She takes care of the Foster's Effect and upholds the rules and regulations of the College. She also handles the College's finances, administration and emergency protocols. =Students= *Mildred Hubble (Georgina Sherrington) ‚Äì The main character of The Worst Witch. In this series, based on her artistic skills Millie gained a scholarship to the college. She appears at the college unchanged, until the end of the first episode she cuts off her trademark plaits after being cheated on by Nick Hobbes and Cas remarked them as being childlike. *Ethel Hallow (Felicity Jones) ‚Äì Ethel is Millie's old nemesis from Cackle's. Upon their first encounter (where they are forced to share a room together) their mutual loathing resurfaces and Ethel claims that Mildred has no right to be in the college. However they become friends except in one episode where Ethel believes Mildred is trying to muscle in on her experimental team for which Doctor Starfinder chose her personally. Mildred states, however, that she \\"didn't ask to be his guinea pig\\". Ethel and Hobbes also nearly tear Millie and Ben apart when they imprison Mildred in the Experimental Magic Laboratory and put Ben in mortal danger. The only way for Mildred to save him was to get inside his head and use his voice to remove the Locking Spell that Hobbes had put on the door to maze he had placed miniature Ben and a very large rat into. Ethel returns with a brand new look but the same attitude. *Deirdre \\"Dee\\" Swoop (Stephanie Lane) ‚Äì A graduate of Pentangle's Academy, more chilled out in this series but loves a spot of jazz (even donning a trilby hat) and taking part in the annual games. *Cas Crowfeather (Abeille G√©linas) ‚Äì Millie's new best friend, hailing all the way from Canada to attend Weirdsister. She \\"replaces\\" Maud Moonshine who does not appear in the series. *Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Hobbes (Bobby Barry) ‚Äì Dark and secretive wizard, not liked by most of the students and has a meglomaniac side to him, it is also often suggested that he has feelings for Mildred. *Azmat Madari (Sacha Dhawan) ‚Äì Wizard, best friend of Tim, comes from Clitheroe, Lancashire. *Tim Wraithewight (Kent Riley) ‚Äì Wizard, comes from Bootle near Liverpool and best friend of Azmat. =Minor characters= *Ben Stemson (Christian Coulson) ‚Äì Non-magical worker of Misery's (ran by his mother) and very good friend of Mildred (boyfriend from episode 6). Although Mildred's witchiness almost ruined their blossoming relationship, he put the feelings aside and even helped use his scientific knowledge to save Weirdsister. *Elaine Stemson (Heather Wright) ‚Äì Owner of Misery's, is into New Age Magic and loves her son a lot. She was very troubled when the Beetle threatened to close Misery's. *Miss Hardbroom (Kate Duch√™ne) ‚Äì Summoned by magic to test Mildred, to see if she was strong enough to enter Weirdsister as a student. Mildred passed and Miss Hardbroom wished her luck and smiled before returning to Cackles. *Enid Nightshade (Jessica Fox) ‚Äì Spent two days at Weirdsister after running away from Primrose Hill (another magic university) to see Millie. Her presence and rebellious behaviour causes tension between Mildred, Cas and Ethel. Enid leaves after revealing that she hated Primrose Hill because she never managed to fit in with the other students, and was expelled for being a bad student and \\"over-partying\\". Episodes DVD release In 2007, Shock released Weirdsister College on DVD, in a boxset with Series 3 of The Worst Witch, although it is titled as \\"Series 4\\" of The Worst Witch. Shock also released box sets of Series 1 & 2 of The Worst Witch, and Series 1 & 2 of The New Worst Witch. These are released only in Australia, but are playable worldwide.

He held the military rank of Colonel General. He was involved in several brutal actions of the Soviet security forces. These actions occurred in the 1940s and were carried out alongside his comrade-in-arms General Ivan Serov. Kruglov was fluent in several foreign languages, including English, and was awarded the Legion of Merit and created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for organizing the security of the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference during World War II.Who Controls the Police? Time, February 13, 1956. Accessed December 28, 2008 Early life and career Sergei Kruglov was born on October 2, 1907, in a village in the Tver Governorate of the Russian Empire; his family was of poor peasant stock, but Kruglov himself went on to receive an excellent education, studying at the Karl Liebknecht Institute in Moscow, the Japanese Department of the Soviet Institute of Eastern Cultures and the very prestigious Institute of Red Professors. His education was mostly about politics, international affairs, and foreign languages, in strong contrast with the scientists, economists and engineers that predominated in the Soviet political elite. Security services career under Stalin =1938 through the end of World War II= Kruglov began working for the Soviet security forces in the early 1930s. In December 1938 he was made a Special Plenipotentiary of NKVD (–û—Å–æ–±–æ—É–ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–º–æ—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ù–ö–í–î), as a part of the Great Purge, with responsibilities of investigating and prosecuting NKVD personnel. He played an active role in purging NKVD of prot√©g√©s of Nikolai Ezhov. On February 28, 1939 Kruglov became Deputy Commissar for Personnel of the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the USSR, and a Chief of the Personnel Division of the NKVD. At the time of that appointment Kruglov held the rank of Major of state security ( equivalent of a KOMBRIG).Alekseƒ≠ Toptygin. –ù–µ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ë–µ—Ä–∏—è (Unknown Beria). Neva, St. Petersburg, 2002. ; page 101 In 1939 Kruglov also became a Candidate Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In February 1941 Kruglov was appointed First Deputy Commissar under Lavrentiy Beria and he retained that position, with a brief interruption, until December 1945. During that period Kruglov was largely responsible in the NKVD for things such as finances, administration, personnel and the Gulag system. During the Second World War, Kruglov had several military assignments. In 1941 he was a member of the Military Council of the Soviet Reserve Front and subsequently, commander of the 4-th Saper Army. During the initial months of the war he was involved in organizing special Blocking Detachments, that included mass executions of the soviet military personnel who were seen as guilty of desertion or unauthorized retreat. In 1944-1945 Kruglov was one of the main Soviet officials in charge of the mass deportations of Chechens and Ingushes. For his role in organizing these deportations Kruglov was awarded the Order of Suvorov, first degree, that was usually given for exceptional combat bravery at the front.Carlotta Gall and Thomas de Waal. Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus. New York University Press, 1999. ; p. 390. In January 1944 Kruglov and Vsevolod Merkulov prepared an NKVD report on the Katyn massacre which blamed the massacre on the Germans.Anna M. Cienciala, Wojciech Materski, Natalia S. Lebedeva (Editors); Marian Schwartz and Maia A. Kipp (Translators). Katyn and its Echos, 1940 to the Present. Katyn: A Crime Without Punishment, pp. 206-355 Yale University Press, 2007 ; p. 227 The NKVD report was subsequently used as a basis by the Soviet Union's Special Commission for Determination and Investigation of the Shooting of Polish Prisoners of War by German-Fascist Invaders in Katyn Forest (also known as the Burdenko Commission), that later in 1944 reached the same pre- determined conclusions of the Merkulov-Kruglov report. In the summer of 1944, when the Soviet troops re-took Lithuania from the Germans, Kruglov was sent to Lithuania to coordinate ruthless punitive measures against the Lithuanian partisans who opposed the Soviet Union's annexation of the country.Vytas Stanley Vardys, Judith B. Sedaitis. Lithuania: The Rebel Nation. Westview Press, 1996. ; pp. 83-84 In 1945 Kruglov was promoted to the rank of Colonel General of NKVD.V. P. Artemiev and G. S. Burlutsky.Structure and Condition of Soviet Organs of State Security After World War II. The Soviet Secret Police.pp. 152-179\\\\. Praeger Publications, New York, 1957; p. 156 Kruglov was appointed as an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire during the Potsdam Conference, becoming the only Soviet intelligence officer to receive an honorary knighthood.Christopher Andrew and Vasill Mitrohhin. Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB. Perseus Publishing, 2000. ; p. 133 =1945 to 1953: at the height of power= On December 29, 1945 Kruglov replaced Lavrentiy Beria as the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union (head of NKVD). In 1946 the Soviet government transitioned to the ministerial system and the security apparatus underwent substantial reorganization. NKVD became the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), with Kruglov as its chief, the Minister of Internal Affairs. NKGB became the Soviet Ministry of State Security (MGB), and it was headed by Viktor Abakumov, who replaced Beria's prot√©g√© Vsevolod Merkulov. Beria became Deputy Prime Minister and retained overall nominal control over both MVD and MGB, which were both, however, now led by Beria's adversaries. Although Kruglov rose through the ranks of Beria's machine, he was not considered a Beria loyalist and after the war allied himself with Viktor Abakumov, a Beria rival. The elevation of Kruglov and Abakumov is now seen by historians as part of a deliberate strategy by Joseph Stalin to limit Beria's influence after the end of the war.Yoram Gorlizki, Oleg V. Khlevniuk. Cold Peace: Stalin and the Soviet Ruling Circle, 1945-1953. Oxford University Press, 2005. ; p. 28 Kruglov's authority as the Minister of Internal Affairs fluctuated significantly over the period 1946-1953. In the beginning this authority included overall control over the Soviet Militsiya (the Soviet Union's regular police force), the paramilitary Internal Troops, running of the Gulag system, border guard, and other areas. In the late 1940s and early 1950s some of this authority had been transferred from MVD to MGB and by 1953 MVD has been mostly in charge only of running the Gulag prison camp system. However, for most of that period Kruglov remained the head of the State Special Commission (–û—Å–æ–±–æ–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏–µ), an extrajudicial body with authority to prosecute those charged with crimes against the State. In 1948 Kruglov organized mass deportation of the German population of the Kaliningrad oblast (formerly East Prussia) - the area around K√∂nigsberg that was annexed by the Soviet Union at the conclusion of World War II. In January 1948 Kruglov and Abakumov presented for Stalin's signature a memorandum that significantly toughened the Gulag conditions for political prisoners.Galina Mikhailovna Ivanova, Donald J. Raleigh and Carol A. Flath. Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System. M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 2000. ; p. 53 Many of those who had been arrested at the height of the Great Purge in 1937-38 and given 10-year prison sentences and managed to survive their time in Gulag were due for release. The Abakumov-Kruglov memorandum, approved by Stalin, authorized the creation of a special system of labor camps for political prisoners. MVD was authorized to hold, when deemed necessary, such political prisoners beyond the expiration dates of their sentences and to send them to the so-called administrative exile (–∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞) in the cases where formal release did occur. Thereafter, both significant terms of administrative exile, given after the completion of the nominal prison sentences, and significant delays of the nominal release after such completion of sentences (referred to as \\"overstaying one's welcome\\"), became standard MVD practices in running the Gulag system. As head of the MVD, Kruglov played a key role in supplying the Gulag prison labor for the Soviet nuclear program headed by Beria. After a successful Soviet nuclear test in August 1949, Kruglov was awarded the Order of Lenin. In 1948 Andrei Zhdanov, who had been a patron of both Kruglov and Abakumov, died and Kruglov's position was temporarily in danger. Beria and Malenkov engineered the so-called Leningrad Affair which resulted in the persecution of many party officials connected to Zhdanov. However, as Stalin still needed a counterweight to Beria, both Kruglov and Abakumov retained their posts, although Beria's position was strengthened. In 1952-1956 Kruglov was a member of the Central Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), to which position he was elected at the 19th Congress of the CPSU.Kruglov, Red Successor to Bereia, Ousted. Chicago Tribune. Feb 1, 1956. Kruglov was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1946-1950 and 1954-1958\\\\. Post-Stalin career and later life After Stalin's death in March 1953, the Soviet security services were reorganized again. In March 1953 MGB was merged into MVD and Beria became the Minister of Internal Affairs with Sergei Kruglov serving as his First Deputy. Both Kruglov and Ivan Serov played key roles in the June 1953 arrest of Beria, engineered by Nikita Khrushchev and Malenkov. After Beria's arrest in June 1953, Kruglov became the Minister of Internal Affairs again,E. A. Andreevich. Structure and Functions of the Soviet Secret Police. The Soviet Secret Police.pp. 96-151\\\\.

The Soviet Secret Police.pp. 3-64\\\\. Praeger Publications, New York, 1957; p. 28 Kruglov remained the Minister of Internal Affairs until 1956, although in 1954 MGB was again split away from MVD and renamed as KGB, with Ivan Serov becoming its head. Kruglov was one of the few leaders of the Stalin-era security apparatus to survive after Stalin's death in March 1953. Beria himself was executed in December 1953. Kruglov's long-term ally Viktor Abakumov was arrested in July 1951 in connection with the so-called Doctor's Plot; Abakumov was not released after Stalin's death and was executed in December 1954. However, in February 1956, Khrushchev fired Kruglov from the position of Minister of Internal Affairs, where Kruglov was replaced by a Khrushchev loyalist, Nikolay Dudorov; prior to Kruglov's dismissal his ministry came under some official criticism and the star of Kruglov's former prot√©g√© and then KGB's head Ivan Serov was seen as rising and displacing Kruglov's influence in the Soviet hierarchy. After his departure from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Kruglov was transferred to the post of Deputy Minister of Electric Power-Stations. In August 1957 Kruglov was demoted further to an even smaller administrative post. In 1958 Kruglov was sent into retirement as an invalid. In 1959 Kruglov was stripped of his general's pension and evicted from his elite apartment. In 1960 he was expelled from CPSU for complicity in the Stalin-era political repressions. Even after Khrushchev's ousting in 1964, Kruglov's fortunes did not improve. Kruglov died in 1977 under unclear circumstances. Several sources state that Kruglov died due to accidentally being hit by a train.Timothy K. Blauvelt. Patronage and betrayal in the post-Stalin succession: The case of Kruglov and Serov.

It was advertised as reminiscent of \\"the glory of ancient Rome\\". The documentary film Continental by Malcolm Ingram covers the height of the club's popularity through the early 1970s.  Facilities  The Ansonia Hotel, New York City, circa 1905 The features of this bathhouse included a disco dance floor, a cabaret lounge, sauna rooms, a narrow \\"Olympia blue\\" swimming pool, bunk beds in public areas, and tiny rooms as one would find in any gay bathhouse. The facility had the capacity to serve nearly 1,000 men, 24 hours a day. One gay guide from the 1970s described the Continental Baths as a place that \\"revolutionized the bath scene in New York City.\\" Some features of the Continental Bathhouse included a warning system that tipped off patrons when police arrived. There was also an STD clinic, a supply of A200 (a lice-killing shampoo) in the showers, a mouthwash dispenser, and K-Y Jelly in the candy vending machine.  Entertainment  An added attraction at the club was the first class entertainment provided by performers such as: * Shelley Ackerman * Karen Akers * Peter Allen * The Andrews Sisters * Jim Bailey * Fontella Bass * Vivian Blaine * Teresa Brewer * Jocelyn Brown * Tally Brown * Cab Calloway * Nell Carter * Chubby Checker * Lou Christie * Natalie Cole * Barbara Cook * Jackie Curtis * Cass Daley * John Davidson * Yvonne Elliman * Betty Everett * Alice Faye * Frances Faye * Totie Fields * Wayland Flowers * Connie Francis * Gloria Gaynor * Lesley Gore * Ellen Greene * Dick Gregory * Alaina Reed Hall * Delores Hall * Dawn Hampton * Hildegarde * Mimi Hines * Brenda Holloway * Loleatta Holloway * Linda Hopkins * Isis * Paul Jabara * Jobriath * Andy Kaufman * Lainie Kazan * Larry Kert * Roslyn Kind * Morgana King * Gladys Knight & the Pips * Frankie Knuckles * Labelle * Dorothy Lamour * Laura Lee * Ketty Lester * Larry Levan * Little Eva * Darlene Love * Lorna Luft * Gisele MacKenzie * Melissa Manchester * The Manhattan Transfer * Barry Manilow * Barbara Mason * Bette Midler * Melba Moore * Jaye P.

Ward * Margaret Whiting * Julie Wilson * Holly Woodlawn Due to her performances at the baths, Bette Midler earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was at the Continental, accompanied by house pianist Barry Manilow (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel) that she created her stage persona the Divine Miss M. Despite Midler's constant complaints about \\"that goddamn waterfall,\\" her poolside performances were so successful that she soon gained national attention, beginning with repeat performances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.  Closure  The Continental Baths lost much of its gay clientele by 1974. The reason for the decline in patronage was, as one gay New Yorker was quoted, \\"We finally got fed up with those silly-assed, campy shows. All those straight people in our bathhouse made us feel like we were part of the d√©cor and that we were there for their amusement.\\" By the end of 1974, patronage was so low that Steve Ostrow had decided to discontinue the lounge acts. He focused, instead, on resurrecting his business by making the baths coed. He even advertised on WBLS, but to no avail. In the end, Ostrow closed the Continental Baths for good. The facility, however, was reopened in 1977 as a heterosexual swingers' club called Plato's Retreat. Plato's Retreat relocated to W. 34th St. in 1980 then was shut down by the city of New York at the height of the AIDS epidemic.  Police raids  In February 1969, the New York City Police raided the Continental Baths.

Whomp That Sucker was recorded without Giorgio Moroder at Musicland Studios, Munich in association with Giorgio Moroder Enterprises. The next four albums were recorded as part of the same partnership. The album marked Sparks return proper to a rock sound after their previous two disco efforts. To complement the Mael Brothers the backing band Bates Motel was hired. The band consisted of guitarist Bob Haag, bassist Leslie Bohem, and drummer David Kendrick. Together this line-up would record the next four Sparks albums concluding with Music That You Can Dance To in 1986. Haag, Bohem and Kendrick also recorded on their own under the name Gleaming Spires. The group recorded three studio albums in the early eighties and had a minor novelty new wave hit, \\"Are You Ready for the Sex Girls?\\", in 1981. Bohem has since become a fairly successful Hollywood screenwriter. Release Whomp That Sucker was released by a number of different record labels; RCA in the US, Underdog in France, Ariola/Oasis in Germany and in the UK by the short-lived Why-Fi Records.

It is from the Brisbane central business district. The people of Karana Downs are represented in the Queensland Parliament by Christian Rowan the Liberal National Party member for Moggill. Geography The semi-rural, leafy suburb is bordered by the Brisbane River to the south and east, and by Mount Crosby Road to the north and west. History Mount Crosby Provisional School opened on 30 January 1882 with 22 pupils under teacher Arthur Leigh. It closed on 31 December 1892, but soon reopened on 11 September 1893 as Mount Crosby State School under head teacher Samuel Rea. The modern locality of Karana Downs was developed from parts of the areas of Kholo, Lake Manchester, and Mount Crosby with of land being divided in 1973. The name Karana Downs was proposed by the developer; it has been suggested that Karana is an Aboriginal name meaning quiet place. Karana Downs was originally part of the Shire of Moreton and then later of the City of Ipswich. In the 1990s residents lobbied to become part of the City of Brisbane. In 2000 Kholo, Mount Crosby and Karana Downs were transferred from the City of Ipswich to become part of the City of Brisbane. In the 2011 census, Karana Downs had a population of 3,826 people. Education Mount Crosby State School is a government co-education primary (P-7) school located on the eastern side of Mount Crosby Road in Karana Downs (). Recreation Kookaburra Park is a large park on the bank of the Brisbane River. Prior to the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods, it included a boat ramp, children's play area, amphitheatre, fishing platform, and off-leash dog area. Virtually the entire park was destroyed by flood-waters in 2011; it has since been reopened with reduced facilities. Karana Downs also has many more parks such as Dumburbi Park, Kupi Park, Heritage Park, Burrun Park, Murri Park, Lion's Nature Trail and Illawong Reserve. Many of the streets and parks in Karana Downs have Aboriginal names. The Karana Downs Country Club has an 18-hole golf course, which formed part of the original plans for the Karana Downs development. In 2011, there were plans to redevelop the golf course into a medium density residential area; these plans were rejected by Brisbane City Council on 27 October 2011. An appeal to the Planning and Environmental Court by the developer was lodged but withdrawn in August 2012. Public transport Due to insufficient population density, according to the Transport Minister and Department, the suburb generally lacks public transport however, in late 2006, a taxi van with a capacity of 10 people, started ferrying people every 20 minutes from 6:30 am to 9:00 am from Karana Downs, and nearby Mount Crosby and Anstead, to Bellbowrie, where commuters can link up with TransLink bus route 444. View of Brisbane River, from Kookaburra Park Demographics In the Karana Downs recorded a population of was 3,826 people, 50.4% female and 49.6% male. The median age of the Karana Downs population was 36 years of age, 1 year below the Australian median. 76.2% of people living in Karana Downs were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 7.5%, New Zealand 3.8%, South Africa 2.1%, Germany 0.7%, United States of America 0.7%. 93.4% of people spoke English as their first language 0.6% Afrikaans, 0.5% German, 0.4% French, 0.4% Spanish, 0.3% Dutch. =Population history= In the 2006 census, Karana Downs had a population of 3,840 people.

The caste of the Indian traders who traditionally used to trade the precious stone is also called Uppal (sometimes spelled as Upal or Oppal). Karakoram Highway Today Upal is on the Karakoram Highway, which follows the old Silk Road route from China to Pakistan. Travelling from China, it is about 50 km southwest of Kashgar or about 180 km north of Tashkurgan (which is about 120 km over the Khunjerab Pass from Sust in Pakistan). Passenger road service between the Tashkurgan and the Pakistani cities of Sost and Gilgit already exists and road service between Kashi and Gilgit (via Tashkurgan and Sust) started in summer 2006. However, the border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass (the highest border in the world) is open only from May 1 to October 15 of every year. During winter, the roads are blocked by snow. Mahmud al-Kashgari Mahmud al-Kashgari died in 1102 at the age of 97 in Upal. There is now a mausoleum erected on his gravesite. He is remembered as a prominent Turkic language scholar. Monday Bazaar A bazaar () is held every Monday.

Meeks (born August 4, 1956) is a former Democratic member of the Illinois Senate, who represented the 15th district from 2003 to 2013. He is also an active Baptist minister in Chicago and chaired the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus. He briefly campaigned for Mayor of Chicago in the 2003 and 2011 election, before dropping out of the race both times. He has now become a leading figure in the campaign to prevent same-sex marriage in Illinois. Meeks was appointed chair of the Illinois State Board of Education by Governor Bruce Rauner and took office January 21, 2017. He succeeded Gery Chico who had resigned the previous week.http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/former-state-sen- james-meeks-takes-over-state-school-board/article_b990f47b-d25d-5bf4-b2ad- ed7b9875dfad.html Biography James T. Meeks was born in 1956.Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 444 After graduating from Chicago's Harper High School, Meeks continued his education at Bishop College in Dallas, where he earned a degree in Religion and Philosophy. =Ministry= In 1985, Meeks, pastor of Beth Eden Baptist Church in Chicago, shared the vision of founding a new church in a sermon.Monica Davey, AT THE CROSSROADS: A NEIGHBORHOOD, A CHURCH AND A PASTOR, chicagotribune.com, USA, April 6, 1999 After a meeting with 205 members that same day, he founded the Salem Baptist Church. The new congregation held its first services January 20, 1985 at 8201 South Jeffrey Boulevard and remained at this location for five-years.Bob Smietana, MegaShepherd, christianitytoday.com, USA, February 1, 2004 In 2005, he inaugurated the House of Hope, a 10,000-seat facility.Manya A.

Leonard, Baptists in America, Columbia University Press, USA, 2005, p. 2  Political career  In 2002, Meeks became the first state senator to be elected as an Independent. He won re-election in 2006 as a Democrat. In November 2011, he announced that he would not seek reelection when his current term ended in January 2013. In 1998, Meeks led a movement to \\"dry up\\" Roseland Community by collecting votes to close 26 liquor stores. He also created a mentoring program called \\"It Takes a Village \\" which provides support and assistance to pregnant youth and young mothers. Meeks was also concerned with issues of housing affordability. He sponsored a bill which would make permanent a 2003 Executive Order that established a task force to develop Annual Comprehensive Housing Plans to address critical housing issues. The bill focuses its attention on vulnerable groups, including those at risk of homelessness and low income people with disabilities. Another bill sponsored by Meeks addressed law enforcement and racial profiling. The bill would allow police departments to apply for grants to purchase cameras for police cars. Meeks believes that cameras in police cars protects everyone involved in a traffic stop, arguing that it provides security for both the driver and the law enforcement officer, and that it may also help reduce instances of racial profiling. Meeks was the chairperson of the Housing and Community Affairs Committee and Vice Chairperson of the Commerce and Economic Development Committee. Additionally, he was a member of the Senate Commerce; Appropriations I; Education; Higher Education; and Senate Education Funding Reform Committees. During his speech supporting the removal of Rod Blagojevich from office, Meeks reprised the governor's now-infamous quote about Barack Obama's Senate seat, saying, \\"We have this thing called impeachment and it's bleeping golden, and we've used it the right way.\\"Senate removes Blagojevich from office. Chicago Tribune, 2009-01-29 Meeks has been a leading and outspoken figure in the 2013 campaign to stop gay marriage legislation in Illinois. Education reform Meeks has become an outspoken advocate for school reform. The June 2006 findings of the Education Trust and Illinois Education Research Council showed that Chicago's worst schools are getting the worst teachers. Meeks believes that this is a civil rights violation of the students and has demanded that the Illinois Attorney General look into the violation. Meeks and a large group of parents also marched on city hall to meet with Mayor Daley in hopes that he could change the teacher hiring system. Meeks came up with a proposal to solve the teacher inequalities; he says top- notch teachers should be offered a $25,000 signing bonus and an additional $5,000 a year for five years to work in failing schools. The teachers' union has historically been opposed to \\"hazard pay\\" because they think all teachers should be paid more. In fall 2008, he announced a boycott of the Chicago Public Schools, urging his congregants and people from other churches to keep their children home until Chicago inner-city schools received more funding from Springfield. Meeks pointed out that at New Trier High School in Winnetka, thousands of dollars more are spent on each student, compared to Chicago Public Schools, where the population is mostly minorities from low-income homes. Over a thousand students met outside New Trier High School in the suburban North Shore to protest. The boycott ended after two days when governor Rod Blagojevich said he would not with Meeks during a boycott. In 2009 and 2010, Meeks worked to pass opportunity scholarships for children in Chicago's worst-performing public schools. This effort was supported by a bipartisan coalition of legislators and outside groups such as the Illinois Policy Institute.  Controversy  In November 2010, in an interview on the radio station WVON, Meeks advocated that only African Americans should be qualified for city contracts designated for minorities and women. During the conversation, he stated, \\"The word 'minority' from our standpoint should mean African American. I don't think women, Asians and Hispanics should be able to use that title. That's why our numbers cannot improve ‚Äî because we use women, Asians and Hispanics who are not people of color, who are not people who have been discriminated against\\". He later retracted his statement by saying he would only forbid white women if elected mayor. He told television station WFLD, \\"I don't believe white women should be considered in that count ‚Ä¶.You have white women in the category. They receive contracts. Then, white men receive contracts. Where does that leave everybody else\\"? The next day, Meeks released a written statement further elucidating his comments. It stressed that \\"all minority- and women-owned businesses\\" are entitled to their \\"fair share\\" of city contracts.  Personal life  Meeks and his wife Jamell live in Chicago, Illinois and have four children: Jamie, Janet, Trent (Christina), and Jasmine, and one granddaughter and a grandson  References  External links *Illinois General Assembly - Senator James Meeks (D) 15th District official IL Senate website **Bills Committees *Project Vote Smart - Senator James T.

They live in desert regions of Australia.  Etymology  The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral Ÿàÿ±ŸÑ, which is translated to English as \\"monitor\\".  Distribution  The short-tailed monitor ranges throughout central Australia from the coast of Western Australia through the interior of Northern Territory and northwestern South Australia to western Queensland. This monitor burrows in compacted sandy loam and gravel, in areas dominated by spinifex (Triodia spp.). This terrestrial species is secretiveVaranus brevicauda mampam.com and rarely seen active above ground; it is mainly encountered by digging up its burrow.  Diet  Pygmy goannas are highly active foragers in the wild.Short Tailed Pygmy Monitor - Varanus brevicauda pilbarapythons.com They eat insects such as grasshoppers, beetles, roaches, caterpillars, as well as reptile eggs, isopods, spiders, scorpions, small lizards and occasionally frogs and even small snakes. These small monitors are bold and fierce predators, despite their size. Reproduction Mating occurs for this monitor lizard in September and October after hibernation, and by February, the eggs hatch.

The Brno Philharmonic (Czech: Filharmonie Brno) is a Czech orchestra based in Brno, the Czech Republic. Its principal concert venue in Brno is the Besedn√≠ d≈Øm. The orchestra also performs regularly in the Jan√°ƒçek Opera House in Brno. The orchestra receives state support from the city of Brno, the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic and the South Moravian Region (Jihomoravsk√Ω kraj). The orchestra's current Intendantin is Marie Kuƒçerov√°. The precursor ensemble to the orchestra, the Czech Symphony Orchestra, began its existence in the 1870s and was resident at the Besedn√≠ d≈Øm. The orchestra had to vacate the Besedn√≠ d≈Øm during the time of 1953-1957. During this period, the current Brno Philharmonic was formed in 1956 with the merger of the Radio Orchestra and the Brno Region Symphony Orchestra. B≈ôetislav Bakala served as the newly formed orchestra's first principal conductor of the new orchestra, from 1956 to 1958. The orchestra again vacated the Besedn√≠ d≈Øm in 1989, but returned permanently in 1995. The orchestra's most recent principal conductor was Aleksandar Markoviƒá, from 2009 to 2015.

Musical style Sunset Rubdown is built around lyricist Spencer Krug's vocals and eccentric musical compositions. Krug's lyrics are characterized by surreal and mythological imagery, and often tell epic stories (most notably on their LP Dragonslayer). Musically, the band's sound is highlighted by distinct drum, keyboard, and guitar signatures. Album releases Krug released the solo-created Sunset Rubdown EP in January 2006. This was followed by the first full band album Shut Up I Am Dreaming recorded in Montreal in early 2006 and released in May to positive reviews, finishing the year with a 15th-place ranking on Pitchfork's best albums list.

The album developed the light synthpop sound of In Outer Space but with slightly darker lyrics revolving around Ron Mael's favourite subject matter: relationships.

It is a rectangular bicolour with a field unevenly divided into blue on the hoist, and white on the fly. Adopted in 1979 by the regional government of the Azores, it is based on the traditional colours and symbols of Portuguese flags used prior to the revolution of 1910. Design 19th century symbol of the Azores =Construction= The flag is constructed in the same form as the flag of Portugal equal to 1 1‚ÅÑ2 times its width, or an aspect ratio of 2:3. The background is vertically divided into two colours: blue on the hoist side, and white on the fly. The colour division is made in a way that blue spans 2‚ÅÑ5 of the length and the remaining 3‚ÅÑ5 are filled by white (ratio 2-3). Positioned over the border of these two bands are nine five-sided stars in a semi-circular arch over a stylized golden goshawk, with its wings extended so that the end stars. =Background= The 1830 flag of the Liberal forces under Peter IV of Portugal The Azorean colours have their beginning in the royalist history of the Portuguese nation, first presented in the coat of arms of Henry, Count of Portugal. During the height of the Portuguese Civil War, in the early 19th century, the Azores served as an important Liberal stronghold, with the prominent Duke of Terceira struggling against the absolutists led by Dom Miguel. The colours of the flag were thus adopted from the Portuguese liberal flag, as to demonstrate the Azores' important role in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The Azorean flag therefore came as an adaption of the flag used from 1830 until 1910, when the monarchy was abolished. Symbolism Blue and white were traditional colours used by the Portuguese nation. The nine stars symbolize the archipelago's nine islands. The name of the archipelago comes from the Portuguese word a√ßor, meaning goshawk, because it was supposed to be a common bird at the time of the discovery. However these birds never existed on the islands, they actually were a local subspecies of the buzzard (Buteo buteo), that was erroneously identified as goshawks by the first explorers.

It was originally released in September 1986, on the label MCA in the US and Consolidated Allied in the UK, two years after their previous album, Pulling Rabbits Out of a Hat. Background Music That You Can Dance To released 1986 was the band's most dance music inspired album since 1979's No. 1 in Heaven. The overall sound of the album was dominated by synthesizers and sequencers like the 1979 album but it differed from that release by the inclusion of the heavily distorted bass guitar of Leslie Bohem, and the emphasis on discordant sound effects. \\"Music That You Can Dance To\\", \\"Fingertips\\" and \\"The Scene\\" represent some of Sparks' most Hi-NRG dance music leanings. \\"Shopping Mall of Love\\", \\"Let's Get Funky\\", and (on the original US edition) \\"Change\\" present a side of the band's sound that is discordant and experimental. Whereas \\"Rosebud\\" and the rerecording of their 1982 single \\"Modesty Plays\\" are not dissimilar from the synth-pop sound that the band had pursued on their previous two albums. \\"Armies of the Night\\" had been recorded for Fright Night (1985), the version that appeared on the European editions of Music That You Can Dance To was a re-recording. The recording of the album was the last time that the Mael brothers worked with the line up of guitarist Bob Haag, bassist Leslie Bohem, and drummer David Kendrick. This line-up had been in place since 1981's Whomp That Sucker. Sparks next album was recorded as a duo with some guest musicians. David Kendrick joined Devo and appeared on their 1988 album Total Devo. Release Music That You Can Dance To was no more successful on the album charts than their previous album, Pulling Rabbits Out of a Hat, had been. It was released on a number of different record labels across different territories: MCA Records in the US, Consolidated Allied Records in the UK and Curb Records in Germany. In the US and Germany, the album substituted \\"Armies of the Night\\" for the 1985 single \\"Change\\". \\"Music That You Can Dance To\\", \\"Rosebud\\", and \\"Fingertips\\" were each released as singles to promote the album. Each was also released as an extended remix. The UK and US remixes of \\"Music That You Can Dance To\\" were different. \\"Fingertips\\" was released as a club promo in the US and was backed with \\"The Scene\\". The club-orientated singles did not register on the mainstream charts, but did make the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart; \\"Music That You Can Dance To\\" made No. 6 (their highest club chart peak) and the Double-A-Side \\"Fingertips\\"/\\"The Scene\\" made No. 38. \\"Change\\" was released in the UK on London Records in 1985 and reached No. 85 on the UK Singles Chart. The stand- alone single was promoted by an appearance on the TV show Wogan. None of the other singles were popular in the UK.  Re-release  In 1990 Curb Records re-released Music That You Can Dance To under the title The Best of Sparks: Music That You Can Dance To. The release featured a different sleeve and corresponded to the US track listing, with \\"Change\\" and not \\"Armies of the Night\\".

In June 2014, the school formally merged with Mount House School to form Mount Kelly School.http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/kelly-college-mount-house-school- announce-merger/story-21741010-detail/story.html The college had twenty acres (eight hectares) of landscaped grounds, including playing fields, set on the edge of Dartmoor and including a stretch of the River Tavy, and four separate senior boarding houses, and a junior house, each with its own facilities. The last headship was of Mr Mark Semmence who joined the college in 2013. The college's motto is fortiter occupa portum - \\"defend your harbours bravely\\", a quotation from Ode XIV from the first Book of Odes by Horace.(1) It offered many extracurricular activities, such as the CCF (Combined Cadet Force) and the DofE Scheme; in addition to a wide variety of sporting activities.  History  The school was founded in 1877 after Admiral Benedictus Marwood Kelly left the great part of his real and personal estate to Trustees, founding a charity which he directed should be called \\"The Kelly College\\", which should be for the education of the \\"sons of Naval officers and other gentlemen\\". The school opened in October 1877, under the Headmastership of Robert West Taylor, late fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, with twelve boys on the school roll.

He is known for his work on these subjects and the geology of Indonesia. Biography Rein van Bemmelen was born in Batavia and spent his youth in the Dutch East Indies, where his father Willem van Bemmelen was the director of the Magnetic, Meteorological and Seismological Observatory. From 1920 to 1927 he studied mining engineering at Delft University in the Netherlands. Among his teachers were H.A. Brouwer and G.A.F. Molengraaff. Van Bemmelen became PhD in 1927 with a study on the geology of the Cordillera B√©tica. He took courses in volcanology at Naples and then worked with the geological survey in the Dutch East Indies, where he mapped parts of Java and Sumatra. From 1933 to 1935 he studied pedology at the Technical University of Vienna. After that he went back to Java to continue his research there. His main interest was in volcanology (magmas and pyroclastic rocks), structural geology and tectonics, especially sliding tectonics. He was able to observe the 1930s activity of Mount Merapi from the volcanological post at Babadan on the north west slope. When the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies in World War II Van Bemmelen and his wife spent three years in a prisoners camp. He belonged to a small number of professionals who were allowed by the Japanese to continue with their work. It was during that time that he managed to publish the 1941 issue of the Netherlands East Indian Volcanological Survey, which came out in 1943. With the end of the war they moved to the Netherlands, where they lived in The Hague. The Dutch government assigned to Van Bemmelen the job to recollect all information on the geology of the Indonesian Archipelago. (Van Bemmelen had summarized that information in a manuscript destroyed during the war). (The manuscript was entrusted to his assistant who took it to Yogyakarta. When diplomatic relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia were established, the manuscript was returned to him. In the meantime, Van Bemmelen was able to produce a similar document and in 1949 his The Geology of Indonesia was published, just after Indonesia's independence. Van Bemmelen then spent a year as assistant of S.G. Trooster at Utrecht University and then worked for Shell as a consultant. Van Bemmelen retired in 1969. Geologie en Mijnbouw marked the occasion of his seventieth birthday with a special issue. Following the death of his wife in 1983 he moved to Austria, where he died shortly after. A controversial TV series was made after his death about his role in the euthanasia of his wife. Academic career In 1950 Van Bemmelen became a professor at Utrecht University. Together with M.G. Rutten he started research on the volcanology and paleomagnetism of Iceland. He supervised seven doctoral dissertations on the tectonics of the Italian Alps and several dissertations on hydrology (his chair was Economic Geology). Van Bemmelen is known for his explanation of orogeny. In his book Mountain Building he postulated his Undation Theory. The mechanism behind orogeny was, according to Van Bemmelen, in the mantle. Due to geochemical differentiation slight differences in density would lead to vertical flow in the mantle, resulting in orogeny. These ideas had to be adjusted with plate tectonics as the mechanism of orogeny. In 1972 Van Bemmelen's book Geodynamic Models the Undation Theory was integrated in plate tectonics.

Early life  In his senior year at high school, Hille and seven other schoolmates from The Peninsula School lodged themselves into a station wagon and crashed it 500m up the road from where they took off in South Frankston. Three of the boys in the car were killed, and the other three seriously injured, but Hille was not injured. The accident report claims that Hille was wearing his seatbelt, which is why he has appeared on commercials about buckling up when driving.  Football career  He made his debut in 2001 with the Essendon Football Club and proved to be a solid ruckman for a number of years. In 2006, Hille was appointed stand-in captain after Matthew Lloyd suffered a season-ending hamstring injury in round three.Hille appointed acting captain  Essendon Football Club  News Story He captained his first game in Round 6, 2006. From 2007 to 2012, he held the role of vice-captain of the Essendon Football Club which he shared with Mark McVeigh for the most part. In the Round 17, 2006 clash between Essendon and Brisbane Lions (the first match Essendon won under his captaincy, and since the beginning of April that year), Brisbane ruckman Jamie Charman fell heavily in a contest, seriously injuring his shoulder. The image of David Hille comforting his opponent whilst medical help arrived was often replayed by the football media as a rare example of sportsmanship in such a competitive game. At the 2008 Essendon Best and Fairest, Hille swept the floor by taking the most prestigious award of the night, the 'Best and Fairest'. Hille also came away with the 'Cheersquad award'. Hille suffered a knee injury in the second minute of the Bomber's annual ANZAC Day match against Collingwood in Round 5, 2009. Scans confirmed he had ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament, requiring a full knee construction and ending his season. Retirement On 29 August 2013, Hille announced his intention to retire from AFL Football at season's end. Hille's career at Essendon included captaining the team in 2006 in the absence of injured forward and captain Matthew Lloyd, winning Essendon's best and fairest, the W.S. Crichton Medal, in 2008 and winning the Yiooken Award in 2010, awarded for being adjudged best on ground in the annual Dreamtime at the 'G match between Essendon and Richmond. Hille, along with 33 other Essendon players, was found guilty of using a banned performance enhancing substance, thymosin beta-4, as part of Essendon's sports supplements program during the 2012 season. He and his team-mates were initially found not guilty in March 2015 by the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal, but a guilty verdict was returned in January 2016 after an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He was suspended for two years which, with backdating, ended in November 2016, although by this stage had already retired from football at all levels. Personal life  Studied a Bachelor of Business at RMIT University and currently lives in Sydney with his wife Kirsty. David and Kirsty have a two year old daughter, Matilda and will soon have a second child. David completed post graduate studies at Sydney University and now works for Deloitte as a senior analyst.

Producing a large body of scholarship ranging from archaeological excavations, ethnoarchaeology as well as epigraphy and linguistics, the Allchins made their work and that of others highly accessible through a series of sole, joint and edited publications. Seminal works include The Birth of Indian Civilisation (1968), which was later superseded only by their books The Rise of Indian Civilisation in India and Pakistan (1982) and The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia (1995). The Allchins were also pivotal in promoting and facilitating the study of South Asian archaeology in Europe as well as within the Subcontinent. In the 1970s, aware of the fragmented nature of South Asian scholarship across Europe and seeking to broaden the capacity that was at the time possible and available within Britain, the Allchins, together with colleagues from Europe, created a biannual platform for South Asian archaeologists, numismatists, epigraphers and historians of art and architecture to exchange information from current research. Forming the European Association of South Asian Archaeologists, the Allchins organised the first meeting, which was held at Churchill College in Cambridge in 1971.Coningham, R. A. E. (2012). \\"Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010)\\". In: Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 19 In reaction to the lack of institutions, teaching posts or funds devoted to the promotion of popular or scholarly interest in South and Central Asia, the Allchins, along with Professor Sir Harold Bailey, Professor Johanna van Lohuizen de Leeuw and Dr Jan van Lohuizen, founded the Ancient and Indian Iran Trust in Cambridge in 1978. The Trust aimed to support and provide a focal point where scholars and members of the public with interests in the cultures of these geographic regions could meet and use its unique library, substantially composed of the collections of its founders.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010). In Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 22; http://www.indiran.org/ The Trust also organised funds to facilitate Indian and Pakistani visiting fellowships, which included highly distinguished scholars including Dilip Chakrabari, Ravi Korisettar, K. Krishnan, V. N. Misra, Lolita Nehru, K. Paddaya, Gautam Sengupta and Vasant Shinde. The legacy of the Allchins, and the Trust that they helped found, continues to support the promotion of South Asian scholarship. In December 2013, the first Annual Allchin Symposium, named in their honour, was held at the Trust. Established to commemorate their work and outstanding contribution to the development of South Asian studies in the United Kingdom, the Symposium brings together established lecturers, post-doctoral researchers and PhD students working in South Asian Archaeology, History and the History of Art and Architecture, providing a forum for the presentation and discussion of current research. Amongst other collections, the Ancient India and Iran Trust also houses the Allchin archive, comprising the photographic slide collection of both Allchins and the meticulous work diaries which Raymond kept during each of his field seasons, offering great potential to scholars of South Asian archaeology.Coningham, R.A.E. 2013.

South Asian Studies 29(2): 242-243 Biography Raymond Allchin, was born in Harrow on 9 July 1923, son of Frank Macdonald Allchin, a doctor, and Louise Maude. His brother was Donald Allchin, Anglican priest and theologian. Raymond was educated at Westminster and enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where he studied architecture for three years followed by conscription into the Royal Corps of Signals. Trained as a Line Mechanic, Raymond was posted to India in 1944. On his return, he embarked on a BA in Hindi and Sanskrit at SOAS, followed by a PhD on the prehistory of Raichur District in Hyderabad under the supervision of Professor K. de B. Codrington at the same institution. It was whilst attending lectures on Indian prehistory at the Institute of Archaeology that Raymond first met Bridget. Raymond and Bridget married in March 1951 before travelling out to India for Raymond‚Äôs PhD field research.Allchin and Allchin (2012: 90) On completing his PhD, Raymond was appointed Lecturer in Indian archaeology at SOAS in 1954. He left SOAS in 1959 for the post of Lectureship in Indian Studies at Cambridge.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010). In Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 9 Raymond was an active field archaeologist throughout his career and his first introduction to South Asian fieldwork was in the Bamiyan Valley of Afghanistan in 1951. Here, under the direction of Codrington, he studied the standing remains of Shahr-e- Zohak.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010).

Raymond‚Äôs selected research topic, the Neolithic of Peninsular India, was one of the areas of South Asian archaeology most poorly understood and was a neglected area of research when compared to the Bronze Age Indus cities or those of the Early Historic period in the north of the Subcontinent.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010). In Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 7 After undertaking a survey of sites within the District, he selected the ash-mound of Piklihal for further investigation. Excavating in 1952, and again in 1957, with the assistance of the Andhra Pradesh Department of Archaeology and Museums, Raymond clearly demonstrated that the ash mound had a distinct Neolithic sequence with later evidence of Iron Age occupation above.Allchin, Raymond (1954) The Development of Early Culture in Raichur District of Hyderabad in the Deccan. PhD Thesis In order to test some of his earlier theories about Piklihal, Raymond selected Utnur for excavation, one of the best-preserved ash mounds. In a single season, he cut through metres of cinder and ash and discovered that the mounds were contained by series of post-holes, demarking superimposed circular stockades. He again dated this site-type to the Neolithic of south India and to the fourth millennium BC on account of the associated polished stone axes. He interpreted the stockades at Utnur as annual cattle camps, whose accumulations of dung were burnt at the end of each grazing season, thus creating a regular sequence of ash and cinder.Allchin, F.R. (1961) Utnur Excavations, Andhra Pradesh Archaeological Series 5, Hyderabad, Government of Andhra Pradesh. He later developed these ideas into a narrative which bound together Hindu ritual tradition and contemporary pastoral practice with the archaeological findings, suggesting that the regular burning of the stockades was not a calamity or the result of raiding but part of an annual fire rite, perhaps surviving today as Holi, Divali or Pongal.Allchin, F.R. (1963) Neolithic Cattle Keepers of South India: A study of Deccan ashmounds, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press On moving to Cambridge in 1959, Raymond turned his attention to Pakistan and worked at the site of Shaikhan Dheri between 1963 and 1964. Working with Professor A. H. Dani of Peshawar University, Raymond and Bridget supervised the processing of antiquities and pottery drawing during the first season.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010). In Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 9-10 Although only on site for one season, Raymond later produced research on artefacts from Shaikhan Dheri. He suggested that a number of small iron plates pierced with small holes around their edges, some of which had rusted together, formed part of the scale armour from the cap of a cataphract, based on observations from Gandharan sculpture, excavation reports, textual sources and contemporary examples from Rajput.Allchin, F.R. (1970) A piece of scale armour from Shaihkan dheri, Charsada. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 2: 113 He also suggested that a number of globular vessels, that Sir John Marshall had interpreted for distillation of water at Sirkap, Taxila, were actually alcohol stills. Basing this hypothesis on ethnographic analogy, Vedic references and Rajput texts he stated that \\"Considering the importance of alcohol for man- kind . . . it is surprising that comparatively little is known of its early history,‚Äô12 and concluding that ‚Äòit may well be that the art of distillation was India‚Äôs gift to the world!\\"Allchin, F.R. (1979) India: the home of ancient distillation. Man 14: 55 Raymond then shifted his focus back to India and undertook an archaeological reconnaissance of the coast of Gujarat in 1967 focused on investigating the presence or absence of sites associated with the Indus civilisation in western India, following this in 1968 with excavations at the site of Malvan with Bridget and Dr J. P. Joshi, of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).Allchin ,F.R. (1995) Excavations at Malvan: Report of the collaboration of the Archaeological Survey of India and Cambridge University in 1970, on the Gujarat plan (Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India). Cambridge Returning to fieldwork in the North West Frontier Province in the Bannu Basin, Raymond and Bridget worked collaboratively with colleagues in the University of Peshawar between 1977 and 1979, working at Lewan and Tarakai Qila with Professor F. A. Durrani and Professor Farid Khan of Peshawar University, Mr Robert Knox of the British Museum, and Professor Ken Thomas of UCL.Allchin ,F.R. et al. (1986) Lewan and the Bannu Basin. Excavation and Survey of Sites and Environments in North West Pakistan. Bar International Series 310 Later as Joint Director of the British Archaeological Mission to Pakistan with Bridget, focus shifted away from the Bronze Age to the Early Historic period and particularly onto the site of Taxila. On a walk around the Hathial ridge one February morning in 1980, not far from the Taxila Museum guesthouse, they discovered numerous sherds of a distinctive, highly burnished red ware covering an area of 13 hectares along the foot of the spur. Raymond recognised that these sherds belonged to the category of Burnished Red Ware associated with the Gandharan grave culture, dating to the beginning of the first millennium BC at the end of the Chalcolithic period. Also aware of the parallel presence of such sherds in the basal levels of Wheeler‚Äôs excavations at the Bala Hisar of Charsadda challenged received wisdom at the time that suggested that such cities had been founded no earlier than the sixth century BC as the Persian Empire expanded eastwards and annexed the satrapy of Gandhara, and that the urban sequences of the region stretched back before Persian contact, possibly back to the late Chalcolithic.Allchin ,F.R. (1981) ‚ÄòHow old is the city of Taxila?‚Äô, Antiquity, 56, 8-14. Though Raymond never excavated to prove such assertions, he was pivotal to negotiating the return of an archaeological team to Charsadda after a gap of thirty years. Jointly directed by his former students, Professor Robin Coningham and Professor Ihsan Ali of Peshawar University, excavations between 1993 and 1997 confirmed Raymond's hypothesis of a much earlier date for initial settlement at c.1300 BC.Coningham R.A.E. & Ali I. (2007). Charsadda: The British - Pakistani Excavations at the Bala Hisar of Charsadda. Oxford: Archaeopress. In 1989, and at the age of 67, Raymond initiated his last major field project in Sri Lanka at the Citadel of Anuradhapura in the island‚Äôs North Central Province following a joint invitation from Dr Roland Silva, director general of archaeology, and Dr Siran Deraniyagala, one of his former students and then archaeological advisor to the Government of Sri Lanka. Raymond invited his former undergraduate and new research student, Robin Coningham, to accept the role of field director,Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010).

As well as undertaking almost forty years of field investigations, Raymond was also motivated by the need to record and protect heritage in the face of the pressures of increasing population and development in South Asia.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012). Frank Raymond Allchin (1923-2010). In Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy. Oxford University Press. IX: 25 Raymond was also one of the pioneers for the protection of heritage sites within their cultural landscape, as illustrated by his work for the UN with the Japanese Planner and Architect, K. Matsushita, in 1969.F. R. Allchin and K. Matsushita, Unpublished UNDP Report for the Lumbini Development Project (New York, 1969), Raymond and Matsushita had been contracted by UNPD with the responsibility to guide the development of Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, following the 1967 visit to the site by U-Thant, the UN Secretary General, who wished to see the site transformed from what Raymond called ‚Äòlittle more than a neglected field‚Äô to a site worthy of ‚Äòa collection of monuments of great importance‚Äô. Tasked with assisting the planning of a sacred garden, pilgrim village and a buffer zone around the site, this report was later used by the Japanese architect, Kenso Tange, as the core for his masterplan for Lumbini, which has directed the development of the site over the last thirty years into the present.F. R. Allchin and K. Matsushita, Unpublished UNDP Report for the Lumbini Development Project (New York, 1969): 10 Recognition of Raymond‚Äôs contribution to South Asian archaeology was rewarded in Cambridge when he was appointed a Fellow of Churchill College in 1963 and promoted to a Readership in Indian Studies in 1972. Away from Cambridge, his achievements were also recognised through being made a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1953, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1957, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1974 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 1981 as well as having an Honorary D.Litt. conferred by Deccan College, Pune in 2007. He also served on the Governing Council of the Society for Afghan Studies and its successor, the Society for South Asian Studies, as well as being associated with the Charles Wallace Pakistan Trust, the British Academy‚Äôs Stein-Arnold Committee and the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Raymond was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy in 1981 and retired with the title of Emeritus Reader in South Asian archaeology in 1989.Coningham, R.A.E. (2012).

The Magdeburg Law became the inspiration for regional town charters not only in Germany, but also in Central and Eastern Europe who modified it during the Middle Ages. The German town law (based on Magdeburg rights) was used in the founding of many German cities, towns, and villages beginning in the 13th century. H√∂chst on Main and Gau-Algesheim from February 11, 1355  History  As Germans began establishing towns throughout northern Europe as early as the 10th century, they often received town privileges granting them autonomy from local secular or religious rulers. Such privileges often included the right to self-governance, economic autonomy, criminal courts, and militia. Town laws were more or less entirely copied from neighboring towns, such as the Westphalian towns of Soest, Dortmund, Minden, and M√ºnster. As Germans began settling eastward, the colonists modelled their town laws on the pre-existing 12th century laws of Cologne in the west, L√ºbeck in the north (L√ºbeck law), Magdeburg in the east (Magdeburg rights), and either Nuremberg or Vienna in the south. The granting of German city rights modelled after an established town to a new town regarded the original model as a Rechtsvorort, or roughly a legal sponsor of the newly chartered town. For instance, Magdeburg became the sponsor of towns using Magdeburg Rights, and its lay judges could rule in ambiguous legal cases in towns using such rights. Certain city rights became known under different names, although they originally came from the same source; the name of some city variants designates the Rechtsvorort they became famous from, not necessarily that that specific style of rights originated from the Rechtsvorort. As territorial borders changed through the passage of time, changes to German city rights were inevitable. Timeline of medieval German charter cities grouped by type. During the course of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, the town laws of many places were modified with aspects of Roman law by legal experts. Ultimately, the older towns' laws, along with local autonomy and jurisdiction, gave way to landed territorial rulers. With the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, almost all of the 51 reichsfrei cities of the Holy Roman Empire were mediatised by the territorial princes; the remaining imperial free cities of Frankfurt, Bremen, Hamburg, and L√ºbeck became sovereign city-states. The only remnants of medieval town rights (statutes) included in the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch of 1 January 1900 were single articles concerning family and inheritance laws. The cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and Berlin are currently administered under Landesrechte, or laws of the federal states of Germany. Many towns granted German city rights had already existed for some time, but the granting of town law codified the legal status of the settlement. Many European localities date their foundation to their reception of a town charter, even though they had existed as a settlement beforehand.  Expansion  German town law was frequently applied during the Ostsiedlung of Central and Eastern Europe by German colonists beginning in the early 13th century. Because many areas were considered underpopulated or underdeveloped, local rulers offered urban privileges to peasants from German lands to induce them to immigrate eastward. Some towns which received a German town law charter were based on pre-existing settlements, while others were constructed anew by colonists. Many towns were formed in conjunction with the settlement of nearby rural communities, but the towns' urban rights were jealously guarded. Initially German town law was applied only to ethnic Germans, but gradually in most localities all town- dwellers were regarded as citizens, regardless of ethnic origin. =L√ºbeck law= L√ºbeck law spread rapidly among the maritime settlements along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea and was used in northern Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, and parts of Pomerelia and Warmia. It formed the basis of Riga law in Riga, used for some towns in the lands of the Livonian Order in Livonia, Estonia, and Courland. =Magdeburg law= Magdeburg law was popular around the March of Mei√üen and Upper Saxony and was the source of several variants, including Neumarkt-Magdeburg law (≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska), used extensively in Upper Silesia, and Kulm law, used in the territory of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia and along the lower Vistula in Eastern Pomerania. Other variants included Brandenburg, Litomƒõ≈ôice, and Olomouc law. =Litomƒõ≈ôice law= Litomƒõ≈ôice law and codes based on that of Nuremberg, such as Old Prague and Cheb law, were introduced into Bohemia during the reign of King Wenceslaus I, while German colonists introduced Br√ºnn (Brno) and Olm√ºtz (Olomouc) law in Moravia. South German law, broadly referring to the codes of Nuremberg and Vienna, was used in Bavaria, Austria, and Slovenia, and was introduced into the Kingdom of Hungary during the rule of King B√©la IV. Jihlava law was a variant used frequently by mining communities in Bohemia, Moravia, the mountains of Upper Hungary, and Transylvania. Other town laws were only suitable for or were modified to fit local conditions, such as G≈Çubczyce, G√∂rlitz, Goslar, L√ºneburg, Lw√≥wek ≈ölƒÖski, Nysa, Spi≈°, and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r laws. =Neumarkt law= Resulting from the reign of King Casimir III of Poland, numerous towns were chartered with Neumarkt town law throughout the Kingdom of Poland in the 14th century, especially in Masovia, Galicia, and Volhynia. Many Transylvanian Saxon settlements in Transylvania, especially in the regions of Altland, Burzenland, and N√∂snerland, received South German town law in the 14th century. In the 15th century, many towns in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were chartered with the Neumarkt town law used in much of Poland, although this was done through the duplication of Polish administrative methods instead of German colonization. In the 16th century Muscovy granted or reaffirmed Magdeburg rights to various towns along the Dnieper acquired from the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the Partitions of Poland, Magdeburg law continued to be used in western Imperial Russia until the 1830s.

All of the rolling stock are double-deck electric multiple units and operate mainly as eight carriage sets. Train sets =K set (1981‚Äì1985)= K set K sets were manufactured by A Goninan & Co and were Sydney's first air-conditioned suburban trains and were built in two separate orders. The first eight carriages built were fitted with air-conditioning from new, while the remainder were built with forced-air ventilation. The second order was retrofitted with air-conditioning between 1987-1990, while the first order was not retrofitted until 2000. =C set (1986)= C set C sets were manufactured by A Goninan & Co. They were introduced in 1986 due to a delay in the design and introduction of the Tangara trains. They are distinguished from the K sets by a molded fiberglass front. They are also distinguished by the different sound of their brakes. They were the first trains to introduce the unpopular fixed seating. There are 14 C sets (C1-C14) The order was for 56 cars: Power cars - C3581-C3608 Trailer cars - T4247-T4274 The first set entered service in July 1986 operating out of Mortdale Maintenance Depot some were delivered to Hornsby Maintenance Depot, but by December 1988 all were operating out of Punchbowl Maintenance Depot as sets K40-K51. All sets were transferred to Flemington Depot when Punchbowl closed. =T set (Tangara) (1988‚Äì1995)= T set Tangaras (T sets) are the third generation of electric rolling stock on the suburban network and were manufactured by A Goninan & Co. They feature a distinctive sloped appearance at the cab ends and run in 4 or 8 car configuration. They were introduced between 1988 and 1994, replacing the last of the first generation single deck electrics which had operated since the 1920s. The last 80 carriages were built as G sets in 1994/95. These ran on shorter interurban services to Springwood, Port Kembla and Wyong. The G sets had baggage storage in each carriage, reversible seats, a toilet and a selective door opening capability for use with shorter platforms in outer suburban areas. These trains also operated on suburban runs, especially outside of peak hours. Following the introduction of the H sets (OSCARs), the G Sets were converted into purely suburban trains and reclassified as T Sets. The toilets were removed during the conversion process but many of the other unique features remain. =M set (Millennium) (2002‚Äì2005)= M set (CityRail branding) Millennium trains (M sets) were introduced between 2002 and 2005, constituting the fourth generation of suburban rollingstock. These were the first suburban trains in Sydney fitted with a multiphase alternating current traction system. They replaced the Tulloch trailers which the S sets ran with. = H set (OSCar) (2006-2012)= H Set OSCAR H sets were introduced to service in 2006-12. The H sets are shared with (and primarily operated by) NSW TrainLink. They are examples of fourth generation trains. The trains will see additional use on Sydney Trains services once the D sets are delivered. =A set (Waratah) (2011‚Äì2014)= A set The A set Waratah trains were the newest rolling stock in the fleet until the arrival of the new B set. Based on the M Set, the design incorporates a number of advancements including 'smart' air- conditioning, newly revamped DVAs, newly revamped extensive use of LED lighting, internal and external closed-circuit television cameras, and a redesigned vestibule area with a wider entrance area and increased priority seating. Waratahs are also the first to consist of an indivisible eight-car configuration. The trains are manufactured in China by the Changchun Railway Vehicles, with internal fitting-out performed by Downer Rail at Cardiff Locomotive Workshops. The first Waratah train entered service on 1 July 2011 with 78 sets completed in June 2014. They replaced most R & S sets, first introduced in the 1970s, as well as timetabled services in which Tangaras and K sets previously operated. = B set (Waratah Series 2) (2018-2019) = B-Set An order for 24 trains of a very similar model was announced in December 2016. These are known as B sets or Waratah Series 2 trains. They feature a number of upgrades and several new elements compared to the A Sets such as a new livery, enhanced accessibility, improved lighting, improved air-conditioning and new information display screens. The first B set was unveiled in Auburn in March 2018.Approval for entry into service Transport for NSW 4 September 2018 The B sets have replaced all 24 remaining 8 car S sets. An additional 17 was announced by the government in early 2019 and deliveries will commence in 2020.

He finished his rugby career at Bath Rugby where a debilitating toe injury limited his appearances and finally ended his playing career. Geoghegan is perhaps best known for his try in the 1994 Five Nations match against England at Twickenham, that was instrumental in a famous 13‚Äì12 win. Another key contribution during the match was a kick, chase and tackle on England fly-half Rob Andrew which led to a crucial kickable penalty to Ireland. An adept side stepper, he was once described by the commentator Bill McLaren as being \\"Like a mad trout up a burn\\". Geoghegan was controversially left out of the 1993 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand when England's Ian Hunter and Tony Underwood were taken ahead of him. Former New Zealand hooker and Geoghegan's then London Irish coach Hika Reid was quoted at the time as being surprised as he felt the conditions would have suited him. In 1997 the Lions management apparently held a place open for him until the last possible minute, even though he had played little rugby that year due to the toe problems that cut short his career. As an amateur player Geoghegan had a career outside rugby as a solicitor.

Life and career Fernand Halphen was the son of Georges Halphen, a diamond merchant, and of Henriette Antonia Stern (1836‚Äì1905), who was from the Stern banking family. From the age of ten, he studied under the direction of Gabriel Faur√© before entering the Paris Conservatory where he took a composition course taught by Ernest Guiraud, who also taught Paul Dukas, Claude Debussy and Erik Satie. After Guiraud's death in 1892, Halphen studied with Jules Massenet, who also taught Henri Rabaud, Florent Schmitt, Charles Koechlin and Reynaldo Hahn. He won first prize for his fugue in 1895, and the next year won second place for the second Grand Prix de Rome with his cantata M√©lusine, behind Jules Mouquet and Richard d'Ivry. Fernand Halphen is known principally as a composer. Among his notable works are the one-act opera Le Cor Fleuri (libretto by Ephra√Øm Mikhael and Andr√©-Ferdinand H√©rold), which debuted in the national theatre Op√©ra-Comique, 10 May 1904, several symphonies, one of which was performed in Paris and in Monte Carlo, a suite for orchestra, the pantomime Hagoseida, the ballet Le R√©veil du faune, some chamber music such as a sonata for violin and piano, works for organ as well as songs. Captain of the thirteenth territorial infantry regiment during World War I, Halphen died for his country on 16 May 1917. =Personal life= On 15 February 1899, Fernand Halphen married (1878‚Äì1963). She also assembled an important collection of paintings including the works of Monet, Pissarro and of Henri Rousseau, as well as the portrait of Fernand Halphen which was painted by Renoir in 1880. Ch√¢teau Mont-Royal The couple had one daughter, Henriette, born on 26 February 1911, and one son, Georges, born 9 March 1913. In 1995, Georges Halphen offered the portrait of his father, painted by Renoir, to the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay. It was to offer his wife a view which enchanted her, he said, that Fernand Halphen bought the house at la Chapelle-en-Serval, near Chantilly (Oise) and decided in 1908 to erect a country house in a wooded valley there: the ch√¢teau Mont-Royal. Halphen Foundation Alice Halphen created the Halphen Foundation (Fondation Halphen) whose purpose was to help students of composition in the Conservatory to publish and perform their works. The Foundation also created social housing on the Ile St. Louis in Paris, taking advantage of a controversial scheme to demolish one side of an original, seventeenth-century street. 10-12 rue des Deux-Ponts housed around 50 rent-controlled apartments in two blocks dating from 1926 and 1930 and aimed at large families. In the round-ups of Jews at the end of September 1942, all 112 tenants, among them 40 young children, were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. By 2003, the apartment block had deteriorated but still housed low-income tenants, some of whom had lived there for decades, in what is France's single most expensive district for real estate. By 2004, the tenants had all left and developers began a major overhaul, marketing \\"luxurious, prestigious\\" one- to four-bedroomed air-conditioned apartments. The first act of the builders renovating the building was to chisel off the coloured mosaic plaque above the main entrance, bearing the words \\"Fondation Fernand Halphen 1926\\". No trace of the Foundation's presence remains. In August 2006, a one-bedroom apartment in the building was on sale for 600,000 euros, 39.7 times the annual gross French minimum wage.

In the 2006 elections he was re-elected as a councillor as part of a group of three Christian Peoples Alliance councillors, and unsuccessfully ran to be mayor of Newham, coming fourth again. As a councillor, Craig opposed the building of the London Markaz Mosque; he said that while he supports the right to worship, he had fears over the impact upon the community and on security. He also opposed the opening of one of the regional casinos in Newham, campaigned to end the DESO-funded arms fair and played a leading role in the campaign to save the Queens Road Market.

Regional Assessment of Global Change Impacts: The Project GLOWA-Danube. Heidelberg: Springer, 2006. p. 94. is the highest peak of the Bavarian/Bohemian Forest mountain range and in Lower Bavaria, with an elevation of . As a result, it is known in the Lower Bavarian county of Regen and the Upper Palatine county of Cham as the \\"King of the Bavarian Forest\\". Its summit region consists of paragneiss.  Name  In a 1279 document the mountain bore the name Adwich; Johannes Aventinus called it H√§dweg in 1500; and, in 1540, √Ñtwa. Philipp Apian referred to it as Aetwha m., i.e. Aetwha mons (mons, montis = Lat. mountain/hill); in 1720 it was recorded on a map as Aidweich. According to more recent research, the name is of Celtic origin. In 1740 it is recorded for the first time as Arber. Geography = Location = Bird's-eye view of the Gro√üer Arber summit The Gro√üer Arber rises in the Rear Bavarian Forest on the boundary of the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park to the north and the Bavarian Forest Nature Park to the south. The boundary running close to the summit, which itself is in the municipality of Bayerisch Eisenstein, while its southwestern flank is in Bodenmais ‚Äì both in the county of Regen. Its western slopes are in the municipality of Lohberg in the county of Cham. Rocks of the Richard Wagner Kopf with the Gro√üer Rachel in the background The Gro√üer Seeriegel The Gro√üer Arber has four tops: the main top with its 1913 summit cross, the Bodenmaiser Riegel with its characteristic, often photographed Richard Wagner Kopf, as well as the Kleiner and Gro√üer Seeriegel. Also part of the mountain group is the Little Arber (1,384 m). = Natural regions = The Gro√üer Arber is part of the natural regional major unit group of the Upper Palatine and Bavarian Forest (No. 40), in the major unit of the Rear Bavarian Forest (403), the sub-unit of the Arber-Kaitersberg Ridge (403.5) and the natural region of the Arber Massif (403.51). = Waterbodies = On the southeastern flank of the Gro√üer Arber lies the lake of Gro√üer Arbersee and, to the northwest and north-northeast of the Kleiner Arber is the Kleiner Arbersee, which both lies within a nature reserve. Among the rivers and streams rising on the mountain are: two Arberbachs (one to the east and one to the south), the Geigenbach, Hirschaubach, Schwellbach, Seebach, Steinbach, Teufelsbach and Weidenbach. The Gro√üer Regen flows past the mountain to the northeast, being fed near the mountain by the Arberseeback and Teufelsbach, and on the northwestern flank the White Regen drains the Kleiner Arbersee, which is fed by the Weidenbach.  Nature parks  Since summer 1995 a full-time nature conservation presence has been active in the Bavarian Forest Nature Park in the area of the Gro√üer Arber. Their management of the area is primarily focussed on the summit region, but also on the protected areas on the mountain as a contact partner for conservation questions and for guided tours. Among their tasks are visitor information, public relations and the monitoring of protected area regulations. Since 1999 another area support servicefor the Gro√üer Arber has been provided by the neighbouring Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park (focus: summit plateau and Kleiner Arbersee Nature Reserve).  Protected areas  From the summit region of the Gro√üer Arber, the nature reserve of the Great Arbersee and Arberseewand (Gro√üer Arbersee und Arberseewand, CDDA no. 163348; designated in 1939; 1.4857 km¬≤) runs away to the southeast. Extending from the summit region to the northwest is the Little Arbersee Nature Reserve (Kleiner Arbersee, CDDA no. 164117; 1998; 4.1059 km¬≤). Near the mountain at the Riesloch Falls is the Riesloch nature reserve (CDDA no. 318989; 1939; 33.4 ha). On the mountain itself are parts of the protected landscapes of the Bavarian Forest (Bayerischer Wald, CDDA no. 396098; 1983; 2310.1276 km¬≤) and Upper Bavarian Forest (Oberer Bayerischer Wald, CDDA no. 396128 1308.5616 km¬≤), the Special Area of Conservation of the Great and Little Arber and Arber lakes (Gro√üer und Kleiner Arber mit Arberseen, FFH no. 6844-373; 22.952 km¬≤) and the bird reserve of the Great and Little Arber and Schwarzeck (Gro√üer und Kleiner Arber mit Schwarzeck, VSG no. 6844-471; 35.4624 km¬≤).  Fauna and flora  The summit region of the Gro√üer Arber does not rise above the natural tree line. Nevertheless, it as treeless and covered by subalpine calcareous grasses, rocky meadows (Felsfluren) and mountain pine bushes, which occur nowhere else in the Bavarian Forest. The characteristic bird species of this region include the meadow pipit, alpine accentor, water pipit, ring ouzel and wheatear. To the north in the direction of Lam there is farmer-managed, selection cutting forest (Plenterwald), in the south towards Bodenmais is state forest.  Climate  = Overview = The summit region of the Great Arber has an average of 160 days of frost and 150 days of snow cover per year. Because of late and early frosts, the vegetation period lasts little more than 100 days. The July temperature in the highest areas is 11 degrees. Of the approximately 1950 mm of annual precipitation, 40% falls as snow. = Arbermandl = In winter the east wind together with ice snow forms the so- called Arbermandl. The mountain pines and mountain spruces of the Great Arber freeze into bizarre and often comical-looking shapes. Cameraman Martin Lippl made a film about it in 1985. The recordings were made somewhat accidentally during a short break of sunshine during a blizzard. Elfie Pertramer later underscored these recordings with a mystical poem. Under the title Voices from the Magic Forest the film will be broadcast at the beginning of each year on Bavarian television in the programme Zwischen Spessart und Karwendel. History Since the 19th century, the Gro√üer Arber and the extended woodlands down to Bayerisch Eisenstein with several former forest glassworks were owned by the princely House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. They procured the estate of the master glassworker, Hafenbr√§dl, in B√∂hmisch Eisenstein, later Markt Eisenstein, today ≈Ωelezn√° Ruda, and, in 1872, the estates in Bayerisch Eisenstein. In 1884, a wooden mountain hut was built by the Bavarian Forest Club. In 1903, the first hut was built on the summit. The current shingle-covered one was built in 1936 and extended in 1985. As early as 1939, large parts of the area were put under protection, in order to save its uniqueness. During the Cold War, a military radar station was built at the top which is still in operation albeit at reduced level - see below. View from the summit looking south View from the summit looking north  Arber Chapel and Arber parish fair  Arber Chapel A little to the northwest and a few metres below the summit of the Great Arber stands the little Arber chapel dedicated to Saint Bartholomew the Apostle. The first chapel there was built in 1806 by the glassworks owner, Baron von Hafenbr√§dl. Since then the building has been renovated four times; the present one was built in 2015. On the occasion of the centenary of the chapel's construction, Abbot Willibald Adam of Metten Abbey celebrated a mountain mass for the first time in the presence of 2,000 people on St. Bartholomew's Day in 1906. On 29 August 1965, the priest of Arber, Josef Kufner, celebrated another mass here, thus founding the first actual Arber parish fair (Arberkirchweih). Since then it has been celebrated every year on the penultimate Sunday in August. After mass, people meet for lunch in the Arber Hut; afterwards folk singers and musicians give performances.  Radar site  The Great Arber with its radome seen from the south Two buildings owned by the German Air Force together with their radomes are situated on the summit. The site was built during the Cold War, in the face of vehement protests by conservationists, close to the border with Czechoslovakia in order to monitor air traffic in the Eastern Bloc. The facility entered service in 1983, originally with two radar antennas. In 1996, it was converted and equipped with a large-capacity RRP 117 radar. Since then, the second tower has contained the transmitting and receiving antennas for radio communications. The Great Arber Air Defence Base is operated as part of the Integrated NATO Air Defence System.  Sport and leisure  = Hiking trails = A footpath runs from Bodenmais to the top of the mountain. It begins at the walkers' car park of Rissloch and climbs up past the Riesloch Falls. The descent may be made past the Little Arber, past the waterfalls and ending back at the start. In addition, there are two tours - the Eight Thousanders Tour (\\"8-1000er Tour\\") and the Twelve Thousanders Tour (\\"12-1000er Tour\\") - which are hiking trails that include an ascent of the mountain along the E6 European long distance path as part of a walk that take in eight or twelve 1,000-metre-high mountains respectively. = Arberland Mountain Run = On 10 June 2017 the Arberland Mountain Run took place, which also included the 2017 German Mountain Running Championships. 346 runners reached the finish line of the 13.8-kilometre course with a difference in altitude of 887 metres. = Arber Bergbahn and winter sports = The lifts on the Grosser Arber are called the Arber Bergbahn. The mountain has been turned into a winter sports area with several ski pistes. On 17 September 1949, the first chairlift was opened on the mountain. The systematic renewal of the lifts in recent years, the construction of a 6-seater gondola lift and the construction of two, six- seater chair lifts have made the mountain's ski area the most modern in the Bavarian Forest. In summer operation, the gondolas transports hikers and tourists to the summit. Slalom and giant slalom competitions have been held on the mountain for the Alpine Ski European Cup since 1973 and, for the Alpine Ski World Cup, since 1976. The races were sponsored by the German Ski Association and alternated between Ofterschwang, Zwiesel and Berchtesgaden. Since 2011, no more ski world cups have taken place there, and according to the responsible organising committee no further races are planned for the foreseeable future.

He also occasionally played centre. He sometimes did place kicking, mainly from a distance or if the regular kicker is unable to take it. He left Toulon at the end of the 2015/2016 season to join French Top 14 side Lyon. He retired at the end of the 2018/2019 season. Early career From 1996 to 2002, Armitage lived in Roquefort-les-Pins on the French Riviera and from the age of 12 Armitage began playing for Rugby Nice C√¥te d'Azur Universit√©-Racing. Armitage was rejected by the France Under-16s, who claimed he was too tall and skinny. On his return to London, Armitage joined Richmond before joining London Irish. Armitage joined the Academy in 2002, where he played for the England U19's and was involved in the team that won the U19's National Cup (02-03). From there he progressed to the U21 squad. His talent was recognised and Armitage played for England in the IRB World Sevens tournament 2005. In August 2009 he took part in the Middlesex Sevens tournament in Twickenham where he helped London Irish to victory over Samerai International to take the championship. In May 2013 he scored Toulon's only try of the match as they won the 2013 Heineken Cup Final by 16-15 against Clermont Auvergne.  England career  Armitage during 2011 RWC On 8 November 2008 Armitage made his full England debut against the Pacific Islanders at fullback following injuries to Mathew Tait and Nick Abendanon. He put in a man of the match winning performance setting up a try for winger Paul Sackey. English Rugby legend and team manager Martin Johnson described Armitage's debut performance as outstanding. Armitage was one of the few England players to warrant any praise during the 2008 Autumn Internationals in which England lost three out of their four matches. Armitage scored his first international points with a 45-meter drop goal against Australia. On 3 February 2009, Armitage and his brother, Steffon Armitage, were both named in England's starting XV to take on Italy in the opening game of the 2009 Six Nations. The ninth pair and the first time since Rory Underwood and Tony Underwood stepped onto the field together in 1995 that two brothers have played in the same England team. In the next match, in the 2009 Six Nations Championship he scored his first try against Wales at the Millennium Stadium. He also scored a penalty and a try in England's 14‚Äì13 loss against Ireland at Croke Park. Armitage scored his third England try in as many games when he touched down against France at Twickenham, in a match England went on to win 34‚Äì10. He celebrated his try by kissing the England badge on his shirt, quite possibly to highlight his snub by the France Under-16s. He played in England's two test matches against Argentina, scoring two tries in the first test. Coaching Career In July 2020 it was confirmed that Armitage had returned to England to become backs coach at National League 1 side Chinnor  Personal life  Armitage's stepfather John played rugby for Hatfield and encouraged his sons to such an extent that four of them are now professional players. Guy plays for Wasps RFC while Steffon plays for Section Paloise. Bevon left RFU Championship club Doncaster Knights in 2010 for his brothers' youth club Rugby Nice C√¥te d'Azur Universit√©-Racing; however, he returned to Doncaster from the 2013-14 season. Armitage was the first native West Indian to play rugby union for England. He has two children with Jemma, whom he married in May 2012, a son Cameron (born 2007) and a daughter Chloe (born May 2009). He is a Queens Park Rangers fan. Away from rugby, Armitage enjoys cricket and tennis. His hero is former All Blacks blindside flanker Jerry Collins.  Controversies  December 2014: Delon Armitage lands 12-week ban after Toulon full back is found guilty of verbally abusing Leicester fans May 2013: Calls former England hooker Brian Moore a 'fat p***k' and tells him to 'Go write another s*** book' in response to criticism of his goading try celebration in the Heineken Cup final.

Ford previously served as the 40th vice president of the United States from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the Electoral College. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ford attended the University of Michigan and Yale Law School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a lieutenant commander. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the U.S. representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader. In December 1973, two months after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment by President Richard Nixon. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. His 895 day-long presidency is the shortest in U.S. history for any president who did not die in office. As president, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, which marked a move toward d√©tente in the Cold War. With the collapse of South Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure. In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President. In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. After experiencing a series of health problems, he died at home on December 26, 2006. Early life Ford in 1916 Ford's childhood home in Grand Rapids, Michigan Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. He was the child of Dorothy Ayer Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader. His father was a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (n√©e Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gardner and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930. Ford later said that his biological father had a history of hitting his mother. In a biography of Ford, James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidants that his father had first hit his mother when she smiled at another man during their honeymoon. After living with her parents for two-and-a-half years, Gardner married Gerald Rudolff Ford on February 1, 1917. He was a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They now called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. The future president was never formally adopted and did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name. He was raised in Grand Rapids with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner \\"Tom\\" Ford (1918‚Äì1995), Richard Addison \\"Dick\\" Ford (1924‚Äì2015), and James Francis \\"Jim\\" Ford (1927‚Äì2001). Ford also had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921‚Äì1993), Leslie Henry King (1923‚Äì1976), and Patricia Jane King (1925‚Äì1980). They never saw one another as children, and he did not know them at all until 1960. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a \\"carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son\\", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two \\"maintained a sporadic contact\\" until Leslie King Sr.'s death in 1941. Ford said, \\"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\\" Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. presidency. Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and captain of the football team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the Grand Rapids City League. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters. College and law school center on the University of Michigan Wolverines football team, 1933 Ford attended the University of Michigan, where he played center, linebacker, and long snapper for the school's football team and helped the Wolverines to two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. In his senior year of 1934, the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player. In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota‚Äîthe eventual national champion‚Äîto a scoreless tie in the first half. After the game, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan said, \\"When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.\\" Ford later recalled, \\"During 25 years in the rough- and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.\\" His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, \\"They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.\\" Ford's high school graduation portrait, 1931 During Ford's senior year, a controversy developed when Georgia Tech said that it would not play a scheduled game with Michigan if a black player named Willis Ward took the field. Students, players, and alumni protested, but university officials capitulated and kept Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team, and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but he eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play. In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the Chicago Bears in the Chicago College All-Star Game at Soldier Field. In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994. With the blessing of the Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the Michigan Football Legends program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against Illinois on October 13. Throughout life, Ford remained interested in his school and football; he occasionally attended games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices; at one point, he asked to join the players in the huddle. Before state events, Ford often had the Navy band play the University of Michigan fight song, The Victors, instead of Hail to the Chief. Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He turned down offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers of the National Football League. Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale University and applied to its law school. Ford hoped to attend Yale Law School beginning in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the University of Michigan Law School and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to Yale Law School. While attending Yale Law School, Ford joined a group of students led by R. Douglas Stuart Jr., and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 Neutrality Act. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the America First Committee, a group determined to keep the U.S. out of World War II. p. 7 His introduction into politics was in the summer of 1940 when he worked for the Republican presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie (who was an interventionist vice an isolationist). Ford graduated in the top third of his class in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan bar shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, Philip W. Buchen. U.S. Naval Reserve The Gunnery officers of . Ford is second from the right, in the front row. Following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Ford enlisted in the navy. He received a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at Annapolis, Maryland. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached all nine sports that were offered, but mostly swimming, boxing, and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943. =Sea duty= After Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier , at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, as well as in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro. Although the ship was not damaged by the Empire of Japan's forces, the Monterey was one of several ships damaged by Typhoon Cobra that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18‚Äì19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. Ford was serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck and was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart H. Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again. After the fire, the Monterey was declared unfit for service. Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at Saint Mary's College of California, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, at the rank of lieutenant commander. Ford received the following military awards: the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine \\" bronze stars (for operations in the Gilbert Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, Hollandia, Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the Philippine Liberation Medal with two \\" bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the World War II Victory Medal. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions in February 1946. Marriage and children The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948 On October 15, 1948, Ford married Elizabeth Bloomer (1918‚Äì2011) at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids; it was his first and only marriage and her second marriage. She had previously been married and, after a five‚Äêyear marriage, divorced from William Warren. Originally from Grand Rapids herself, she had lived in New York City for several years, where she worked as a John Robert Powers fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the Martha Graham Dance Company. At the time of their engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of 13 terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the election because, as The New York Times reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, \\"Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer.\\" The couple had four children: * Michael Gerald, born in 1950 * John Gardner, known as Jack, born in 1952 * Steven Meigs, born in 1956 * Susan Elizabeth, born in 1957 House of Representatives (1949‚Äì1973) Michigan's 5th district After Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. \\"I came back a converted internationalist\\", Ford wrote, \\"and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one.\\" During his first campaign in 1948, Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked. Ford also visited local farms where, in one instance, a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory. Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding Michigan's 5th congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in The New York Times described him, Ford \\"saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career.\\" Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Ford described his philosophy as \\"a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy.\\" Ford voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a \\"Congressman's Congressman\\".Celebrating the life of President Gerald R. Ford on what would have been his 96th birthday, H.R. 409, 111th Congress, 1st Session (2009). In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called \\"the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the history of mankind ... I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives\\". =Warren Commission= The Warren Commission (Ford 4th from left) presents its report to President Johnson On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission, a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. He and Earl Warren also interviewed Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer. According to a 1963 FBI memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities. In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions. =House Minority Leader (1965‚Äì1973)= Congressman Gerald Ford, MSFC director Wernher von Braun, Congressman George H. Mahon, and NASA Administrator James E. Webb visit the Marshall Space Flight Center for a briefing on the Saturn program, 1964. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader. With a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the \\"Great Society\\". During the first session of the Eighty-ninth Congress alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104. In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections produced a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs. Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public knowledge after he spoke from the floor of the House and questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of having played \\"too much football without a helmet\\". As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen, in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this \\"The Ev and Jerry Show.\\" Johnson said at the time, \\"Jerry Ford is so dumb he can't fart and chew gum at the same time.\\" The press, used to sanitizing Johnson's salty language, reported this as \\"Gerald Ford can't walk and chew gum at the same time.\\" After Nixon was elected president in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program for state and local governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against). During the eight years (1965‚Äì1973) that Ford served as Minority Leader, he won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality. Vice President (1973‚Äì1974) Gerald and Betty Ford with the President and First Lady Pat Nixon after President Nixon nominated Ford to be vice president, October 13, 1973 To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 ($228,847 in 2020 dollars) in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon \\"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\\" The advice was unanimous. \\"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,\\" House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be \\"a nice conclusion\\" to his career. Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice- presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States. Ford became vice president as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford to tell him to prepare for the presidency. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, \\"Al Haig asked to come over and see me,\\" Ford later said, \\"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house. President (1974‚Äì1977) =Swearing-in= Chief Justice Warren Burger in the White House East Room, while Betty Ford looks on. When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency. This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office by the Electoral College. Immediately after Ford took the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: \\"I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers.\\" He went on to state: He also stated: A portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to his presidential museum. On August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him. =Pardon of Nixon= House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in reference to his pardon of Richard Nixon On September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation \\"is a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\\" Ford's decision to pardon Nixon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and said a \\"corrupt bargain\\" had been struck between the men. They said that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, which had elevated Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend Jerald terHorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to Bob Woodward, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared. Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the 1976 presidential election, an observation with which Ford agreed. In an editorial at the time, The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a \\"profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act\\" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's \\"credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence\\". On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon. He was the first sitting president since Abraham Lincoln to testify before the House of Representatives. In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President Nixon by name, referring to him in public as \\"my predecessor\\" or \\"the former president.\\" When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent Fred Barnes pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in a surprisingly frank manner: \\"I just can't bring myself to do it.\\" After Ford left the White House in January 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.Shadow, by Bob Woodward, chapter on Gerald Ford; Woodward interviewed Ford on this matter, about twenty years after Ford left the presidency In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.\\"Sen. Ted Kennedy crossed political paths with Grand Rapids' most prominent Republican, President Gerald R. Ford\\", The Grand Rapids Press, August 26, 2009. Retrieved January 5, 2010. =Draft dodgers and deserters= On September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in Military discharge status. Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter administration. =Administration= When Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's Cabinet. During his brief administration, he replaced all members except Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon. Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the \\"Halloween Massacre\\".

The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865‚Äì1869).Bush vetoes less than most presidents, CNN, May 1, 2007.

The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford. University Press of Kansas, 1995 In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \\"Whip Inflation Now\\". As part of this program, he urged people to wear \\"WIN\\" buttons.Gerald Ford Speeches: Whip Inflation Now (October 8, 1974), Miller Center of Public Affairs. Retrieved May 18, 2011 At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, \\"WIN\\" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption.Brinkley, Douglas. Gerald R. Ford. New York: Times Books, 2007 On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the \\"WIN\\" campaign. Over the next nine days 101,240 Americans mailed in \\"WIN\\" pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five- percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion.Crain, Andrew Downer. The Ford Presidency.

Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States. Ford expressed \\"strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children\\" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing. The economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975. In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8 billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these income tax rebates as part of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53 billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7 billion for 1976. When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout. The incident prompted the New York Daily News famous headline \\"Ford to City: Drop Dead\\", referring to a speech in which \\"Ford declared flatly ... that he would veto any bill calling for 'a federal bail-out of New York City.

This had also been his position as House Minority Leader in response to the 1973 Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade, which he opposed. Ford came under criticism for a 60 Minutes interview his wife Betty gave in 1975, in which she stated that Roe v. Wade was a \\"great, great decision\\". During his later life, Ford would identify as pro- choice. =Foreign policy= Ford meets with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to sign a joint communiqu√© on the SALT treaty during the Vladivostok Summit, November 1974 Ford continued the d√©tente policy with both the Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975. The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into Human Rights Watch. Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada. Ford supported international solutions to issues. \\"We live in an interdependent world and, therefore, must work together to resolve common economic problems,\\" he said in a 1974 speech. According to internal White House and Commission documents posted in February 2016 by the National Security Archive at The George Washington University, the Gerald Ford White House significantly altered the final report of the supposedly independent 1975 Rockefeller Commission investigating CIA domestic activities, over the objections of senior Commission staff. The changes included removal of an entire 86-page section on CIA assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by then-deputy White House Chief of Staff Richard Cheney. Middle East Countries visited by Ford during his presidency In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978. Ford with Anwar Sadat in Salzburg, 1975 In the continuing Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the Yom Kippur War, Kissinger's continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress. Ford considered it \\"stalling\\" and wrote, \\"Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.\\"Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240 During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, which included: On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. \\"Reassessment\\", in practical terms, meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was \\"an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations\\". The announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford \\"experienced a real shock\\" when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be \\"responsive\\" to Israel's request for $2.59 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives.George Lenczowski, American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150 The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli \\"war of nerves\\" or \\"test of wills\\".Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298 After much bargaining, the Sinai Interim Agreement (Sinai II) was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed. Vietnam Ford and his daughter Susan watch as Henry Kissinger (right) shakes hands with Mao Zedong, December 2, 1975 One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces. The accords had been negotiated by United States National Security Advisor Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member L√™ ƒê·ª©c Th·ªç. South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords. In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of Phuoc Long. General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Tr√† sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion. As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested Congress approve a $722 million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration. Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin. Senator Jacob K. Javits offered \\"...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid\\". President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country. Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at Tulane University. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over \\"...as far as America is concerned\\". The announcement was met with thunderous applause. 1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 Vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon during Operation Frequent Wind. In that operation, military and Air America helicopters took evacuees to U.S. Navy ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the fall of Saigon. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats. Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. The 1975 Act appropriated $455 million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees.Plummer Alston Jones (2004). \\"Still struggling for equality: American public library services with minorities\\". Libraries Unlimited. p.84. In all, 130,000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975. Thousands more escaped in the years that followed. East Timor Indonesian President Suharto with Ford and Kissinger in Jakarta on December 6, 1975, one day before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. The former Portuguese colony of East Timor declared its independence in 1975. Indonesian president Suharto was a strong U.S. ally in Southeast Asia. In December 1975, Suharto discussed the plans to invade East Timor during a meeting with Ford and Henry Kissinger in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. would not object to the proposed Indonesian annexation of East Timor. According to Ben Kiernan, the invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter of the Timorese population from 1975 to 1981. Mayaguez and Panmunjom North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.Gawthorpe, A. J. (2009), \\"The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon\\", The Historical Journal, 52(3):697‚Äì716. The first crisis was the Mayaguez incident. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters. Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the Mayaguez sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.Gerald R. Ford, A Time to Heal, p. 284 The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C. Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot.C√©cile Men√©tray-Monchau (August 2005), \\"The Mayaguez Incident as an Epilogue to the Vietnam War and its Reflection on the Post-Vietnam Political Equilibrium in Southeast Asia\\", Cold War History, p. 346. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia. The second crisis, known as the axe murder incident, occurred at Panmunjom, a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try to convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.Oberdorfer, Don (2001), The two Koreas: a contemporary history (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47‚Äì83. Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's Joint Security Area. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of Non- Aligned Nations in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at which Kim Jong-il, the son of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.Gawthorpe, \\"The Ford Administration and Security Policy\\", p. 711. At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as \\"the paper tigers of Saigon\\" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included B-52 bomber flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.Gawthorpe, \\"The Ford Administration and Security Policy\\", pp. 710‚Äì714. =Assassination attempts= Reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt Ford was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency. In Sacramento, California, on September 5, 1975, Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a Colt .45-caliber handgun at Ford and pulled the trigger at point-blank range. As she did, Larry Buendorf,\\"Election Is Crunch Time for U.S. Secret Service\\". National Geographic News.

She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009, after serving 34 years. In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, fired a .38-caliber revolver at him. The shot missed Ford by a few feet. Before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. =Judicial appointments= Supreme Court John Paul Stevens, Ford's only Supreme Court appointment. In 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O. Douglas. Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon. During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached. After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues. Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens. \\"He has served his nation well,\\" Ford said of Stevens, \\"with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.\\"Letter from Gerald Ford to Michael Treanor .

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.Another Loss For the Gipper. Time, March 29, 1976.

Jimmy Carter and Ford in a presidential debate, September 23, 1976. Televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they \\"gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer\\". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, \\"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.\\" Ford also said that he did not \\"believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union\\". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. 1976 electoral vote results In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford.\\"Presidential Election 1976 States Carried\\". multied.com.

Ford successfully invested in oil with Marvin Davis, which later provided an income for Ford's children. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.Perrone, Marguerite. \\"Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953‚Äì2003\\". 2003. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, \\"Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye.\\" During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002. Like Presidents Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, Ford was an honorary co-chair of the Council for Excellence in Government, a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees. He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian Bob Hope, a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a hole in one during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic at Colonial Country Club in Memphis, Tennessee. He hosted the Jerry Ford Invitational in Vail, Colorado from 1977 to 1996. In 1977, Ford established the Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy at Albion College in Albion, Michigan, to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the north campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan, followed in September by the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in 1980, forgoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an \\"Accidental President\\" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as Jim Rhodes of Ohio and Bill Clements of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee. On July 16, 1980 (day 3 of the 1980 Republican National Convention) Gerald Ford consults with Bob Dole, Howard Baker and Bill Brock before making a decision to ultimately decline the offer to serve as Ronald Reagan's running mate After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented \\"co- presidency\\", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice- presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush.Allen, Richard V. \\"How the Bush Dynasty Almost Wasn't\\" , Hoover Institution, reprinted from the New York Times Magazine, July 30, 2000. Retrieved December 31, 2006. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that the country would be \\"better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter\\". On October 8, 1980, Ford said former President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: \\"I think it would have been much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan.\\" On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the Federal Reserve Board due to his appointing of most of its members: \\"President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin. This latest action by the president is cowardly.\\" Following the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for Thomas Kean that criminals who use firearms should get the death penalty in the event someone is injured with the weapon. In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against succumbing to Wall Street demands and follow his own agenda for the economic policies of the US during an appearance on Good Morning America: \\"He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic future of this country is going to be. They are wrong in my opinion.\\" On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference. On March 24, 1982, Ford offered an endorsement of President Reagan's economic policies while also stating the possibility of Reagan being met with a stalemate by Congress if not willing to compromise while in Washington. Ford founded the annual AEI World Forum in 1982, and joined the American Enterprise Institute as a distinguished fellow. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University on March 23, 1988. During an August 1982 fundraising reception, Ford stated his opposition to a constitutional amendment requiring the US to have a balanced budget, citing a need to elect \\"members of the House and Senate who will immediately when Congress convenes act more responsibly in fiscal matters.\\" Ford was a participant in the 1982 midterm elections, traveling to Tennessee in October of that year to help Republican candidates. In January 1984, a letter signed by Ford and Carter and urging world leaders to extend their failed effort to end world hunger was released and sent to Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar. In 1987, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of District of Columbia Circuit Court judge and former Solicitor General Robert Bork after Bork was nominated by President Reagan to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Bork's nomination was rejected by a vote of 58‚Äì42. In 1987 Ford's Humor and the Presidency, a book of humorous political anecdotes, was published. By 1988, Ford was a member of several corporate boards including Commercial Credit, Nova Pharmaceutical, The Pullman Company, Tesoro Petroleum, and Tiger International, Inc. Ford also became an honorary director of Citigroup, a position he held until his death. In October 1990, Ford appeared in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with Bob Hope to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the birth of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, where the two unveiled a plaque with the signatures of each living former president. In April 1991, Ford joined former presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Jimmy Carter, in supporting the Brady Bill. Three years later, he wrote to the U.S. House of Representatives, along with Carter and Reagan, in support of the assault weapons ban. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Ford compared the election cycle to his 1976 loss to Carter and urged attention be paid to electing a Republican Congress: \\"If it's change you want on Nov. 3, my friends, the place to start is not at the White House but in the United States' Capitol. Congress, as every school child knows, has the power of the purse. For nearly 40 years, Democratic majorities have held to the time-tested New Deal formula, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.\\" Ford at his 90th birthday with Laura Bush, President George W. Bush, and Betty Ford in the White House State Dining Room in 2003 In April 1997, Ford joined President Bill Clinton, former President Bush, and Nancy Reagan in signing the \\"Summit Declaration of Commitment\\" in advocating for participation by private citizens in solving domestic issues within the United States. On January 20, 1998, during an interview at his Palm Springs home, Ford said the Republican Party's nominee in the 2000 presidential election would lose if the party turned ultra conservative in their ideals: \\"If we get way over on the hard right of the political spectrum, we will not elect a Republican President. I worry about the party going down this ultra-conservative line. We ought to learn from the Democrats: when they were running ultra-liberal candidates, they didn't win.\\" In the prelude to the impeachment of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at Emory University. In October 2001, Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican Party by stating that gay and lesbian couples \\"ought to be treated equally. Period.\\" He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.Price, Deb. \\"Gerald Ford: Treat gay couples equally\\" .

At the time of his death, Ford was the longest-lived U.S. president, having lived 93 years and 165 days (45 days longer than Ronald Reagan, whose record he surpassed). He died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry S. Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission. On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. president to lie in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. A state funeral and memorial services was held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, January 2, 2007. After the service, Ford was interred at his Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked for Scouts to participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral.

Bush with Ford and his wife Betty on April 23, 2006 Ford is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. \\"In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word,\\" said Martha Griffiths. The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought. In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple- minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation. Civic and fraternal organizations Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), American Legion, AMVETS, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Sons of the Revolution, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. =Freemasonry= Ford was initiated into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949.The Supreme Council, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA.

But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States.\\" Ford was made a 33¬∞ Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States. Ford was also a member of the Shriners and the Royal Order of Jesters; both being affiliated bodies of Freemasonry. Honors Ford received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in May 1970, as well as the Silver Buffalo Award, from the Boy Scouts of America.

It was formed in January 1980, and was originally known as the United Democratic OppositionLAWPHIL.net: G.R. No. 56515 - United Democratic Opposition (UNIDO), petitioner, vs. Commission on Elections (COMELEC), respondent. from 1980 to 1982. It was initially a union of eight major and minor political parties and organizations with the main aim to oust President Marcos through a legal political process. In April 1982, the coalition received its present name, and increased its members to twelve parties. Shortly after the assassination of popular opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr., the party was led by Senator Salvador Laurel of Batangas. History The political leaders forming UNIDO such as prominent anti-Marcos leaders like former Senator and Batangas Assemblyman Salvador Laurel, former president Diosdado Macapagal, Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco, Senator Gerardo Roxas, Manila Assemblyman Lito Atienza, Antique Governor Evelio Javier, Mandaluyong Assemblyman Neptali Gonzales, Pampanga Governor Joe Lingad, Senator John Osme√±a, Senator Dominador Aytona, Senator and renowned nationalist statesman Lorenzo Ta√±ada, Senator Eva Estrada-Kalaw, Senator Rene Espina, Senator Mamintal Tamano, Senator Domocao Alonto and nephew Abul Kharyl, Assemblyman Raul Gonzales, Assemblyman Homobono Adaza, former Philippine Collegian editor- in-chief and leftist-bent journalist Abe Sarmiento, and all significant personalities that contributed to the fall of the Marcos dictatorship. The political groups allied with UNIDO were the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino‚ÄìLakas ng Bayan (PDP‚ÄìLaban) represented by Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr., Bansang Nagkakaisa sa Diwa at Layunin (BANDILA) led by Agapito Aquino, the younger brother of Ninoy Aquino and one of the founders of the August Twenty-One Movement (ATOM). UNIDO gained momentum in the last week of November 1985, when President Ferdinand Marcos called for a presidential election due to mounted political pressures. At first, UNIDO supported Senator Salvador Laurel of Batangas as its standard bearer, but business tycoon Chino Roces was not convinced that Laurel or Jovito Salonga could defeat Marcos in the polls. Roces argued that Corazon Aquino, the widow of assassinated Senator Aquino, should be the candidate for president. Roces initiated the Cory Aquino for President Movement (CAPM) to gather one million signatures in one week to urge Aquino to run as president, convincing Aquino to do so. Aquino was made the presidential bet of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino‚ÄìLakas ng Bayan party. However, Laurel did not give way to Aquino for the opposition's nomination as President until he was convinced by Cardinal Jaime Sin to run as her running- mate. Aquino had previously approached Laurel with a deal, wherein Aquino would give up her allegiance to the PDP‚ÄìLABAN party and run as president under the UNIDO banner, with Laurel running for Vice President, effectively uniting the opposition groups against Marcos. Laurel had also previously offered Aquino the Vice Presidential nomination for UNIDO. In any case, Aquino ran for president under the UNIDO banner, with PDP‚ÄìLABAN endorsing UNIDO coalition. The campaign was made in the month of January 1986, for the February election. Although she was officially reported to have lost the election to Marcos, the elections were widely believed to be fraudulent. Both Marcos and Aquino claimed to have won, and held rival inaugurations on February 25, but Marcos then fled in the face of huge popular demonstrations and the refusal of the military to intervene against them. UNIDO was dissolved after the 1987 legislative and general elections, when new parties were formed and parties parted ways. Among the parties formed from UNIDO, the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino, became the dominant party of the Philippines until 1992. = 1987 Philippine Legislative Elections = The Lakas ng Bayan coalition for the elections was composed of PDP‚ÄìLaban, Lakas ng Bansa, UNIDO, the Liberal Party- Salonga Wing, the National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines, the Philippine Democratic Socialist Party, BANDILA and Pinaghiusa. = 1988 Crisis = The PDP‚ÄìLaban was split into the Pimentel and Cojuangco wings. The Lakas ng Bansa, headed by Ramon Mitra, and PDP‚ÄìLaban's Cojuangco wing, joined forces to found a new party that would support President Cory Aquino's programs, the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino or LDP, thus shaking the anti-Aquino alliance into confusion. = 2016 National Elections = After 29 years, UNIDO returned to the Philippine political scene as an accredited party-list group that participated in the 2016 national elections, but lost. = 2019 National Elections = In the 2019 election, UNIDO ran for a seat in Congress, but again lost.

Imported from South Korea and introduced in Europe as a pet in the 1960s, it is the only chipmunk found outside North America and is classed either as the only living member of the genus Eutamias, or as a member of a genus including all chipmunks. Description File:Asiatisches Streifenhoernchen.jpgSiberian chipmunk with its long tail clearly visible File:Tamias sibiricus (head).JPGThe close-up of head File:Tamias Sibiricus- legs.JPGThe close-view of legs with hooked claws Although these animals can exhibit slight variations in coloration in different geographic regions, they possess several common characteristics. Typically the Siberian chipmunk has 4 white stripes and 5 dark stripes along the back. It is 18‚Äì25 cm long, a third of which is the tail. The weight of adults depends on the time of year and food availability. Even though the Siberian chipmunk normally grows to 50‚Äì150 grams, this species is relatively small compared to other Sciuridae, such as the red squirrel. The Siberian chipmunks are not known to exhibit sexual dimorphism, and size and body proportions are the only way to distinguish younger chipmunks from older ones. Their small size may contribute to their relatively short lives, which tend to range from 2 to 5 years in the wild. However, when placed in captivity, as seen in Europe in the 1960s, they have the potential to live anywhere from 6 to 10 years. Distribution Siberian chipmunks were found only in their native range of Eastern Asia until the 1960s, when this species was introduced to European countries. During the 1960s, South Korea began to export these animals to Europe as a part of the pet trade. Between 1960 and 1980, South Korea exported more than 200,000 individuals to Europe. Human introduction is a major risk for the spread of this species into other forests and areas. By the 1970s, the Siberian chipmunk inhabited suburban forests and urban parks in Belgium, France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria. This is mostly caused by owners releasing these animals because they no longer wanted them as pets, or the owners purposefully freed the chipmunks to live naturally in the wild. Other Siberian chipmunks escaped from captivity and inhabited the forested areas of Europe. The Dutch chipmunks for example are escapees from a former zoo in Tilburg. When the zoo was shut down and all animals were moved away, many chipmunks got forgotten due to their underground residence. While thousands of animals were introduced to new environments, they are naturally slow spreading, 200 to 250 meters per year, prevented them from rapidly moving to areas far beyond where they escaped. Habitat Eutamias sibiricus near Lake Kuyguk The Siberian chipmunk can survive in a variety of habitats and conditions. They are usually found in coniferous forests, stony areas within forests and mountains, habitats filled with shrub, along waterways or roads, or other small patches of agricultural land. In Europe, the introduced populations usually live in deciduous forests, mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, or urban areas with greenery. Tamias sibiricus is able to survive in various environmental conditions, anywhere from 29¬∞N to 69¬∞N and ‚àí65 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C. However, this species has a low ability of dispersal, and since they are mainly introduced into woody forests or urban areas with greenery, they have less potential to be naturally dispersed to other regions. Also they have trouble overcoming man-made and naturally occurring obstacles, like roads or swamps. The Siberian chipmunk lives in loose colonies, where every individual has its own territory. The territory ranges from 700 to 4000 m2 and is larger for females than males and is also larger in autumn than spring. The Siberian chipmunk marks its territory with urine and oral glands inside of its cheeks. This method illustrates one way in which this species communicates with one another. Behaviour Siberian chipmunks usually live solitary lives, but during the winter they create a burrow, which they often share with another chipmunk. Its burrow, which can be 2.5 m long and 1.5 m deep, consists of a nest chamber, several storage chambers and chambers for the waste. During this winter season, these chipmunks store 3‚Äì4 kg of food in order to survive underground until April or May. In addition to the pairing off during hibernation, they also use a complex voice communication system to interact. They have two vocal sounds, a fast, sharp sound for when they are frightened and a deep croak sound that is thought to be used for mating. =Reproduction= While most chipmunks and squirrels are promiscuous in their mating routines, little is known about the mating habits of the Siberian chipmunk. It is known that they are iteroparous, viviparous, and their breeding season usually occurs after hibernation in mid April. They tend to breed only once or twice a year, and the number of offspring varies from 3 to 8. The young are born blind and naked, and they weigh between 3-5 grams. After the 28- to 35-day gestation period, the offspring open their eyes about 20 to 25 days after birth. The females are responsible for caring for the young, and they teach them how to forage around 6 weeks. Then the offspring complete the weaning stage around 7 weeks, and they reach the independent stage around 8 weeks. Adult body mass is reached at around 3 to 4 months, and by 9 months, both the male and the female reach sexual maturity. =Diet= A Siberian chipmunk eating bread A chipmunk eating nut photographed in Mount Oike, Higashiomi, Shiga prefecture, Japan. Siberian chipmunks are omnivores that store or cache food. Normally, they eat Siberian pine seeds, along with different deciduous and coniferous tree seeds. In addition to seeds, they eat herb roots, insects, mollusks, birds, reptiles, grains, fruit, and fungus. =Ecosystem roles= Siberian chipmunks are essential food sources for other animals, such as diurnal raptors, weasels, and small cats. Other known predators include hawks, owls, and foxes. They evade being preyed upon by these animals by being alert, hiding in their burrows, and using their camouflaged fur to blend in with surroundings. They distribute seeds and fungal spores, and other animals feed off their stored food. Chipmunk fur- skins Impacts =Positive impacts= Siberian chipmunks disperse seeds and fungal spores, which help forests grow and regenerate. They also aid species diversity by helping control pests in its environment. In addition to the beneficial aspects for the environment, some humans keep Siberian chipmunks as pets or sell them for their fur or other body parts. =Negative impacts= Estimated contribution to Lyme disease comparison chart The increasing rate of urbanization provides humans with greater mobility, and this advancement provides easier opportunities for humans to introduce non-native species, many of which cause health or economic issues. For instance, Siberian chipmunks tend to eat crops and damage urban gardens. In Russia, they eat approximately 50 percent of the forest nuts, and in other locations they can produce economic setbacks in regards to grains and orchards because of large consumption of these products. These chipmunks are also known for preying upon low-nesting birds, and Siberian chipmunks often compete with other small native animals, such as the red squirrel, wood mouse, and bank vole. However the most concerning aspect of this species' influence revolves around its ability to carry diseases, like Lyme disease, that have the potential to create danger for humans and domestic animals. Lyme disease, also known as Borrelia burgdorferi, is a vector-borne disease that can be transmitted through ticks. In comparison to bank voles and wood mice, the Siberian chipmunks contribute a much larger risk when it comes to Lyme disease. The chipmunk's ability to spread this disease poses a risk to humans because Lyme disease can cause neurological, joint, and skin problems. The Invasive Species Compendium states that the Siberian chipmunk can easily survive and spread diseases, like Lyme disease, to humans because the species has high genetic variability and high reproductive potential. Also, with the Siberian chipmunk's movement and introduction into new environments, ticks and other parasites possess a greater opportunity to attach to hosts. Lastly species invasion is difficult and costly to control, so these animals will continue to pose a threat to humans and other animals until they eventually became extinct or until humans actively take measures to reduce their impact on society.

In other major International victories, Team India won the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.' Cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. India won its first World Cup in 1983, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. The '80s and '90s also saw the debut of Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid, and Kumble, considered to be among the greatest Indian players. Ganguly's, captaincy is considered to be the turning point of Indian cricket as it saw great success and became one of the dominant side of the sport, followed by the captaincy of MS Dhoni under whom India won its second World Cup in 2011, the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, and Champions Trophy in 2013. Currently, Virat Kohli is the captain in all formats.

Maharaja Of Patiala Sir Bhupinder Singh or Bhuppa best known for his extravagance and for being a cricketer. His cricket teams ‚Äì Patiala XI is among the best of India. He was a great patron of sports.Maharaja of patiala is the man behinde the golden history of Indian Cricket His passion for the game of cricket is just riveting he sponserd various tours of India for cricket and various tournaments by his own money,cricket for him is second big thing after his kingdom . He was captain of the Indian cricket team that visited England in 1911, and played in 27 first-class cricket matches between 1915 and 1937.For season of 1926/27, he played as member of Marylebone Cricket Club. He donated the Ranji Trophy in honour of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar. He was selected as the captain of India on its first Test tour of England in 1932, but dropped out for reasons of health two weeks before departure and the Maharaja of Porbandar took over. All this way India becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. India made its debut as a Test-cricket- playing-nation in England in 1932 led by CK Nayudu, well before Indian independence. The team performed well, with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1-42 in the match against England. The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the top scorer with 40 runs. England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always seemed out of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs. The team's first series as an independent country was in 1948 against Australia at Brisbane. Australia were led by Sir Don Bradman while India was led by Lala Amarnath. The Australians returned home, winning the 5 Test series with the score 4‚Äì0. Queen Elizabeth II with members of the Indian team during the Indian tour of England in 1952. India's first ever Test victory came against England at Madras in 1952. India's first series victory was against Pakistan later the same year. In 1954, India drew a 5-Test series with Pakistan 0‚Äì0, the batting strength from India had come from Polly Umrigar and Vijay Manjrekar while the prime bowler was Subhash Gupte with 21 wickets in the series. India's first series against New Zealand in 1956 created a comprehensive series victory for India, winning the 5-Test series 2‚Äì0. MH Mankad was excellent in his batting, averaging 105.2 in the series while scoring 526 runs. Once again, S.M. Gupte held India's bowling together, with 34 wickets. The remainder of the 1950s did not show as good results as the start: India lost a 3-Test series to Australia (2-0), lost a 5-Test series against the West Indies (3-0), The team's performances again began to improve in the 1960s, starting with their first series win over England in 1961‚Äì62. During this time, India's strong record at home started to develop, in which the team won a series against New Zealand in 1965-66 and drew series against Pakistan, Australia and England. In 1967‚Äì68, India won their first series outside the subcontinent against New Zealand. = One-day cricket and World Cup success (1970‚Äì1985) = Sunil Gavaskar made his debut for India in the West Indies in 1970-71 and immediately made an impact, scoring a total of 774 runs for the series and helping India to a 1‚Äì0 series win, their first ever win over the West Indies. Together with established players like Bishen Bedi, Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Erapalli Prasanna and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Gavaskar formed the nucleus of arguably India's strongest Test team up to that point in time. India's win over the West Indies was followed by home and away wins over England in 1971 and 1972‚Äì73. During the 1980s, other players like Mohammed Azharuddin, Ravi Shastri, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, Sanjay Manjrekar, Krish Srikkanth and Maninder Singh emerged. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating West Indies in an exciting final. = Late 20th century (1985‚Äì2000) = In 1985, India won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. The Test series victory in 1986 in England remained, for nearly 19 years, the last Test series win outside subcontinent. Sunil Gavaskar became the first batsman to accumulate 10,000 runs in Test cricket, and went on to register a record 34 centuries, surpassed only recently by Sachin Tendulkar. Kapil Dev, a genuine all-rounder, became the highest wicket taker in Test cricket, surpassing Richard Hadlee to take a total of 434 wickets, a record which has since been broken by Courtney Walsh, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan and has also been surpassed by fellow Indian Anil Kumble. The emergence of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble in 1989 and 1990 was to herald an era of Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with Brian Lara of the West Indies and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India for most of the 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to stay cool under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting, however, declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The Hyderabadi stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left a lot to be desired. Towards the end of 1999, the Indian team was in flux. Although they had performed well in the 1999 World Cup, the winter was marked by a disastrous tour to Australia which exposed the Indian team's weaknesses when playing abroad, marked with a loss of form of most of the batsmen, except Tendulkar and the newly emerged VVS Laxman. After Tendulkar quit captaincy and Azharuddin was banned for match-fixing, Sourav Ganguly took over as captain, and the New Zealander John Wright became coach. = Turn of the millennium (2000‚Äì2007) = Sourav Ganguly's captaincy heralded a new era in Indian cricket. It began in the famous series against Australia in 2001, when Steve Waugh's strong team was defeated 2‚Äì1 in a Test series after having taken a 1‚Äì0 lead at Mumbai. The series is best known for a remarkable turnaround by the Indian team in the Kolkata Test, when VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh's performance took India to victory after they had followed on. This series marked a turning point in the Indian team's fortunes, and provided the team with the boost they dearly needed. This was followed by stellar performances by the team when playing abroad, with Test victories coming in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, England, Australia, and a famous series victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in 2004. The series in England in 2002 is billed as Rahul Dravid's series, as he became the top scorer for the Indians, with centuries coming at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Headingley in Leeds and a famous 217 at the Oval in London. This was followed by a sensational win in Australia at Adelaide in 2003, where Dravid, VVS Laxman and Ajit Agarkar scripted a come-from-behind victory after the team had conceded 556 runs in the first innings. The series win in Pakistan that followed was marked by Virender Sehwag becoming the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket. Along with Sehwag, players like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif emerged, making the Indian batting order one of the strongest in the world in both forms of the game*. Their performances helped reduced India's dependence on their top guns in one-day cricket, and a 7-batsman policy contributed to India's successes in the limited-overs game, culminating in their reaching the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. In the bowling department, India unearthed a plethora of fast-bowling talent, with Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, and later Irfan Pathan and L Balaji leading the pack. The veteran Anil Kumble became the highest wicket-taker for India after surpassing Kapil Dev, and also passed the 500-mark in March 2006. His bowling performances abroad improved considerably, and he played a major part in India's overseas performances in England, Australia and Pakistan. Harbhajan Singh also provided him great company in the spin department, and at home the two bowling in tandem became a familiar sight. Sachin Tendulkar celebrates upon reaching his 38th Test century against Australia at the SCG in 2008. * Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 \\"SuperTest\\" against Australia. In 2005, Indian cricket was again shrouded in controversy. After a somewhat slow season marked by a dip in team performance following the famous Pakistan series ended, the coaching job passed from John Wright to the Australian Greg Chappell. Saurav Ganguly, whose batting form had taken a beating in that year, was involved in a spat with Chappell over whether he should be continuing as captain to reduce pressure on him. This was followed by Ganguly being dropped from the team and Rahul Dravid taking over as captain. While Tendulkar, Sehwag and Dravid formed the mainstay of the Indian batting, the coming of age of players like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif led to the emergence of younger stars like Suresh Raina and MS Dhoni. India's traditional strengths have always been its line-up of spin bowlers and batsmen. Currently, it has a very strong batting lineup with Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag all being selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 \\"SuperTest\\" against Australia. In previous times, India was unique in that it was the only country to regularly field three spinners in one team, whereas one is the norm, and of the fifteen players to have taken more than 100 wickets, only four were pace bowlers from the last 20 years. However, in recent years, Indian pace bowling has improved, with the emerging talents of Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and Sreesanth and many more playing in the national team. India, however have always struggled in the pace department with the only prominent pace bowler ever coming was Zaheer Khan. India has had a very good record against Australia and, before the 2004/05 tour, never being defeated by Australia in a Test Series in India since 1969. This was the reason for Australian captain Steve Waugh labelling India as the \\"Final Frontier\\". The famous 2001 Australian tour of India saw Harbhajan Singh become the first Indian to take a Test hat-trick and started a good run for the team, as India beat Australia 2‚Äì1. India also came runners up to Australia in the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Since 2004, India had not been doing as well in One-day Internationals. The players who took India to great heights over the past ten years such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble grew older and did not maintain their form and fitness. Following the series loss to Australia, India collapsed on the final day in the Third Test in Bangalore in early 2005 against Pakistan to squander a series victory, and then lost four consecutive ODIs against Pakistan. This was exacerbated by the suspension handed to captain Ganguly for slow over-rates. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the new coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and replaced Kumble and V. V. S. Laxman from the ODI team with younger players. India's unconvincing ODI form continued, scraping past a West Indian team depleted by industrial action in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup and a similarly depleted Zimbabwean team only to be defeated twice in the finals by New Zealand, continuing a poor ODI finals record. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly lead to a confidential email sent by Chappell to the BCCI being leaked, in which he condemned the leadership and performance of Ganguly. After a series of high-profile board meetings and public jousting including some players, Rahul Dravid was installed as the captain, triggering a revival in the team's fortunes. The Indians subsequently defeated Sri Lanka 6‚Äì1 in a home series. An important part about this series was the discovery of the young talent of the team, including Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan. The team also beat the Sri Lankans in the Test series 2-0 to displace England from its position in second place in the ICC Test rankings, but India slipped back by losing the high-profile series to Pakistan. Indian team continued its good form in ODIs, beating Pakistan 4‚Äì1 in Pakistan. India achieved the world-record of winning 17 successive matches chasing the total. India convincingly won England's tour of India winning the series 5‚Äì1. After leveling the DLF Cup series 1‚Äì1 in Abu Dhabi, India travelled to West Indies where they lost the ODI series 1‚Äì4 to a weak West Indies team which was ranked 8th in the ICC ODI Ranking. The series loss again questioned the Indian team's ability to play away from the Sub- continent and the chances of the Indian team to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Dravid's captaincy was cut short in the ill-fated 2007 World Cup, where India were out of the league stage following an embarrassing loss to Bangladesh. This was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni taking over the reins. = Under Dhoni and Kohli (2000‚Äìpresent) = series against New Zealand in 2010. Under MS Dhoni, India won the inaugural T20 World cup. It also began an era of India's dominance in world cricket in both tests and ODIs, culminating in a victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup and a 4‚Äì0 whitewash of Australia in a home test series.http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/current/match/433606.html It also saw Indian batsmen scoring the only 200s ever, first Sachin Tendulkar then Virender Sehwag and then Rohit Sharma on three occasions. Dhoni has been widely acknowledged as the most successful Indian captain ever. However, following a drubbing in a test series down under in late 2014, he retired from tests. Virat Kohli with coach Duncan Fletcher, c. 2015. In the 2015 World Cup, India reached the semi-finals. In June 2017, India toured England for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy where the Virat Kohli led mighty team lost to Pakistan in the final by 180 runs. Later India toured the Windies where the team won the ODI series by 3‚Äì1 but lost the T20I series. By defeating Sri Lanka by 9‚Äì0 in all three formats, India became the first team to cleansweep Sri Lanka in ODI series in their home soil. In January 2018, Virat Kohli led Indian team toured South Africa where they lost the Test series by 1‚Äì2. But the Team showed some extravagant skills and defeated the mighty South African team and clinched the ODI series by 5‚Äì1 and T20I series by 2‚Äì1. By the series win, India became the second Asian country to defeat South Africa in ODI and T20I series on their home soil after Pakistan. In the 2019 World Cup, India were defeated in the semi-finals by New Zealand. International tournaments Since advancing to full Test Status and the creation of more and more international cricket tournaments, India has slowly become involved in a number of Cricketing tournament's including the Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and Asia Cup. India's first two Cricket World Cups were largely failures, and the team failed to progress beyond the first round. But India upset the West Indies in the final of the 1983 Cricket World Cup to claim the Prudential Cricket World Cup for the first time, captained by Kapil Dev. India and the West Indies had cruised through the preliminary rounds in Group B, while England and Pakistan emerged the victors from Group A. Most considered India to be the underdogs in the group stages, and their win against West Indies was categorized as similar to Zimbabwe's win over Australia in the same World Cup. They were, in fact, quoted as having odds of 66 to 1 before the beginning of the tournament. The Indian cricket team in action in the Wankhede StadiumIndia's performance in the remaining world cups has been considerably consistent. In the 1987 Cricket World Cup, the team advanced to the semi-finals as favourites, they did the same in 1996, both times they suffered upset defeats in the semi-finals. India was less strong in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and did not make it past the Super Six section. However they impressed all in the 2003 Cup, only losing two games (both against reigning champions Australia) and advancing to the finals before taking a loss. In the year after their World Cup victory, (1984) India continued its new-found dominance over One Day Cricket with a comprehensive win over arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. They went on to secure more victories over their Asian rivals, winning the 1984 Asia Cup with a victory over Sri Lanka in the finals. It won its third consecutive Asia Cup with a victory over Sri Lanka in 1990. It continued its strong streak in 1995, again beating Sri Lanka in the final. However, in 1997, a confident Sri Lanka riding on their first-ever World Cup victory swept past a weaker Indian side, breaking the 4-tournament winning streak.

Two singles were released, both of which received gold certifications. Background This album was launched after a highly successful American-style series of shows that Dalida performed at the Palais des Sports theatre in France. She was the first female singer to perform this kind of show at the venue with twelve costume changes and eleven dancers. All the show's 18 nights were sell-outs. The album, like the show, was highly successful and it was a critical and commercial success. It also helped Dalida to create more of a sexy and Diva like image. Learning dance routines for over three months with John Travolta's Saturday Night Fever choreographer Lester Wilson, Dalida (aged 47 at the time) reinvented herself through this show and once more attracted a new generation of fans.

TV performances of this track saw Dalida dancing in leopard-print dresses in tropical style while surrounded by topless male dancers. \\"Comme disait Mistinguett\\" talks about Dalida's music career with a bit of humour. For TV promotion of the song, Dalida wore a long pink cape with a sexy outfit underneath. It won her a gold disc. It was during this disco period that Dalida started to gain following in the gay community, which is still maintained today. * \\"Gigi in Paradisco\\" / \\"Je suis toutes les femmes\\" \\"Gigi in Paradisco\\", the title track of the album, was released as a single in 1980. The song is the continuation of Dalida's biggest worldwide hit \\"Gigi l'amoroso\\". The 13-minute song follows the tragic events of Gigi that dies and goes up to disco heaven. Dalida created this song essentially to use during her shows but eventually it was released as a single, with the track being edited to four minutes. It was Dalida's last disco hit, and it also earned gold certification.

Cecil, the son of the British prime minister, was the staff officer and second-in-command of the garrison. The cadets consisted of volunteer boys below fighting age and were used to support the troops, carry messages, and help in the hospital. This freed up men for military duties, and kept the boys occupied. The cadets were given khaki uniforms, a wide-brimmed hat which they wore with one side turned up and a Glengarry cap. The towns people often commented on their smartness. 13-year-old Sergeant-Major Warner Goodyear was their leader. The Mafeking Cadets are claimed to be one of the inspirations for the Boy Scouts. Cadet duties One of the cadets' duties was to carry messages around the town and to outlying forts, sometimes as much as a mile away across open ground. At first they used donkeys, but as the siege ran on, food became scarce and the donkeys were killed and eaten. From then on, the cadets used bicycles instead. Another important duty was to act as lookouts, mainly to warn the townspeople when the Boer siege guns were aimed and fired at different parts of the town. The town produced its own postage stamps, known as \\"Mafeking Blues\\", for postage during the siege. One set depicted the cadet leader Warner Goodyear seated on a bicycle . The Mafeking stamps were unusual among the stamps of the British Empire at that time, because they did not depict the monarch. Frankie Brown, a 9-year-old boy, was killed by a shell during the siege, and is sometimes claimed as a cadet casualty, although it is unlikely that he was a cadet. The youngest cadets on the nominal roll were aged 11. At the end of the siege, 24 cadets were awarded the Defence of Mafeking bar to the Queen's South Africa Medal. Inspiration for Boy Scouts Robert Baden-Powell was the British commander during the siege of Mafeking. He was impressed by the cadets and wrote of them in the opening pages of his 1908 book, Scouting for Boys. Baden-Powell related the following conversation with one of the cadets: I said to one of these boys on one occasion, when he came in through rather a heavy fire: 'You will get hit one of these days riding about like that when shells are flying'. And he replied 'I pedal so quick, Sir, they'd never catch me'.

Kalofer is part of Plovdiv Province and the Karlovo municipality. It is best known as the birthplace of Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev. The modern settlement of Kalofer emerged in the 16th century, managing to preserve its Bulgarian character in the Ottoman Empire and to develop as a centre of craftsmanship, primarily cord production. The Kalofer monastery has been in operation since 1640 and the convent since 1700. During the Bulgarian National Revival the town became a centre of revolutionary activity, being the birthplace of figures such as Hristo Botev, Exarch Joseph, Dimitar Panichkov, Nikola Ivanov.  Geography  Kalofer is located in the southern outskirts of Stara Planina. It is only 17 kilometers away from Karlovo, 22 km away from Sopot, 56 km away from Plovdiv, 222 km away from Burgas, 300 km away from Varna and 164 km from the capital of Bulgaria Sofia.  History  Kalofer was founded in the 16th century (1533). From the very beginning it enjoyed privileges as a city, which allowed it to preserve its typical Bulgarian character. In the time when traditional customs were booming about 1200 devices for producing traditional colored Bulgarian wollen threads (gaitan) were operating in the town. Traditional Bulgarian holidays have always been observed in Kalofer. The town has been burnt down at least three times. Due to forestation the marks from the damage has been covered, but they can still be found here and there. With the passage of time, residents of Kalofer have created their own methods of survival and have cultivated a strength of character, which has remained their typical personality trait until today. Each time when the town was burnt, the people of Kalofer built it all over again, carrying stones from their own farming land, working through the night. Usually reconstruction activities started with re-building the church or the monastery.  Religion  Kalofer has a number of churches and monasteries, many with church bells. On a small street is a convent for girls, inheriting four metochions, in which Anastasia Dimitrova, the first Bulgarian female teacher, was educated. The monastery for men has been open since 1640, and the convent for nuns since 1700. Today, both of them, despite the numerous burnings, are open for visitors.  Economy  Kalofer Lace In Kalofer typical Bulgarian customs and traditions have been well preserved over the centuries. A part of the attractions in the region is visiting ateliers producing the internationally famous Kalofer lace or the traditional rugs or woolen covers (kitenitsi). The making of souvenirs, works of copper, barrels for wine, incrustrated knives, as well as the typical Bulgarian dishes will always be remembered in this region.  Amenities  There is no bank in Kalofer, but two bank branches are available. In the city center there are two automated teller machines. The post office in Kalofer is open Monday to Friday, and there are shops and convenience stores in the area. Several shops are located in the center of the town, and there is a market on Thursdays. Annual events Kalofer is known in Bulgaria for the traditional Bulgarian all-male horo danced in the ice-cold river on Epiphany *January 6: Birth of Hristo Botev and Epiphany (Yordanov Den). *June 2: Day of Botev. *August 15: Holiday of Kalofer Lace.

Life and career Jacob was born in Cheny, Burgundy. He arrived in Paris in 1754 and was apprenticed to the chairmaker Jean-Baptiste Lerouge where he met Louis Delanois, whose advanced neoclassical taste was to have a great influence on Jacob. He was received master 4 September 1765, presenting for his masterpiece a small chair of gilded wood, which survives. Without marrying either the daughter or the widow of an established menuisier,Jacob married in 1767 Jeanne-Germaine Loyer with whom he had five children. Jacob set up his own premises. He employed in his workshop numerous specialist carvers and gilders. In 1785, Jacob produced the first mahogany chairs √† l'anglaise, for the comte de Provence. After Delanois' early death in 1792, Jacob's only serious rival in his field was Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sen√©. He retired in 1796, leaving his workshop in the hands of his sons, one of whom was Fran√ßois-Honor√©-Georges Jacob-Desmalter.

The album was well received by critics and achieved fair commercial success in France, Canada, Lebanon and Belgium. The album contained less upbeat dance songs and more biographical and love songs. \\"Lucas\\" touches the theme of Dalida's being childless, \\"Mourir sur sc√®ne\\" expresses her wish to die while still at the height of fame, and \\"Bravo\\" about the misfortunes of fame. Dalida began promotion for the album in Canada during the month of April 1983. Being the guest of honour in the Tele-Quebec Telethon television special in which she performed five songs from the album. To promote the album in France, Dalida recorded a one-hour TV special called \\"Formule Un\\" with then number one French television programme \\"Les Carpentiers\\". She performed seven songs from the new album on \\"Les Carpentiers\\", with the most notable performance being the haunting \\"Mourir sur sc√®ne\\" rendition. Dalida only released the following double sided singles of this album Les p'tits mots / Mourir sur sc√®ne before releasing an updated version of the album that included two new recordings, namely \\"Femme\\", a cover of a Charlie Chaplin movie theme called \\"Smile\\", and the song \\"Ton pr√©nom dans mon coeur\\", a cover of the love theme from \\"Jeux Interdits\\", which had previously been sung with other lyrics by French singer Mireille Mathieu. Dalida released from the second album the double sided singles Femme / Le restaurant Italien and performed the song \\"Femme\\" on various French TV shows.

After Dalida's death, the song \\"Mourir sur sc√®ne\\" took a huge meaning and became one of her most legendary songs. The song's music and powerful lyrics say that the only desire of the singer is to die on stage where she was born and the singer talks with death during the verses symbolically asking death not to strike when the singer is sleeping alone in the shadows. Dalida's live performances of this song during her concerts were so powerful and sincere that it was always followed by a standing ovation. The song became immensely popular and is now considered a classical French pop ballad of the 1980s and one of Dalida's trademarks and signature tracks. A remix of the song was released in 1995 and got a lot of radio airplay but the original version of the song is the most widely played on radio stations in all French speaking countries to this day. Dalida recorded the song in French, English, Spanish and Italian, whilst Shirley Bassey included the English version of the song in her repertoire and performed it during her live concerts in the early nineties. *1983 Femme / Le restaurant italien \\"Femme\\" is a Charlie Chaplin movie theme that have been recorded by Dalida in 1983 after receiving the blessings from Charlie Chaplin family and rights owners. Dalida widely performed \\"Femme\\" on French television and there are no less than 18 performances of the song on French television. Dalida performed this song with four male dancers around her as part of the song's choreography. = Non-album singles = *1983 Buona sera Phantasie / Der Charme der kleinen Worte Dalida chose from this album the songs \\"Le restaurant italien\\" and \\"Les p'tits mots\\" to record in German and release them as singles in Germany.

The song was a minor hit and Dalida only promoted it for a couple of months in France and Belgium. The B-side was an album song by Didier Barbelivien called \\"La pensiona Bianca\\". Promotional singles of this song were published and TV promotion of the song was done on many TV shows by Dalida. *1987 Pour en arriver l√† One of the best songs on the album, \\"Pour en arriver l√†\\" was not picked up as a single during 1984 but was released as a farewell single after Dalida's death in 1987.

It was also her first album to be made as a CD format. The name \\"Le visage de l'amour\\" is usually used by Dalida to describe her public and her fans, it was picked up by the big French artist Charles Trenet who decided to write a song for Dalida bearing this name. It eventually became the name of her last album. Dalida didn't promote the album like she used to do for her former releases, appearing only for a week of promotion on French TV. Subsequently the album failed to chart upon its release but did chart right after Dalida's death in 1987 entering the top 20 for 2 weeks. The album is a collection of rather moody to sad songs while containing a dance number called \\"Mama Caraibo\\" and that was later disregarded by Dalida herself who didn't like the song quality. Two singles of the album were already released and heavily promoted in 1985 but failed to chart. Another 2 songs were released and poorly promoted upon the outing of the album but the whole project was a little neglected due to Dalida filming and releasing the most important movie of her career, a picture by Egyptian director Youssef Chahine called Le sixi√®me jour. This movie earned huge positive reviews from movie critics all over the world praising Dalida's performance but the movie was not a commercial success. Nevertheless, this movie remains a strong proof of Dalida's acting talent and a great addition to her legacy.

It remained as such throughout the Second World War. The brigade was a part of The Gibraltar Defence Force, established as a result of no local military force presence on the rock prior to the war. The Gibraltar Defence Force was a small anti aircraft unit that expanded as the war went on.Ashley Jackson, \\"The British Empire and the Second World War\\", 2006 As a part of the Gibraltar Defence Force, it was crucial to the war effort. Gibraltar's significance cannot be underplayed as it is known by many as the key to the strait. Even Gibraltar's coat of arms is a shield with a three towered castle with a golden key underneath. This shows the significance of the rock as the key to the strait. The first bombing of Gibraltar in 1940 did little to break morale and actually stiffened resolve among Gibraltarians. Some of which then decided to join the fight, as a part of the Gibraltar Defence Force. The rock was the choke point of Mediterranean Maritime activity and was crucial to the war effort for Britain and her allies. The rock had long been one of the most sought after location's for many empires. It was even considered \\"The Greatest Thoroughfare of Trade and Commerce in the World\\". The 1st Gibraltar Brigade and The Gibraltar Defence Force would be one of the most significant for the success of Britain and her allies.Nicholas Rankin, \\"Defending the Rock: How Gibraltar Defeated Hitler\\", 2017  Significance of the Unit The strait was one of the most significant points of interest for many years prior to the war and during a wartime effort, it is obvious that this fact would not change. Of course then, the unit or units stationed to defend this key point of interest would be extremely crucial to the success of the war effort for those that controlled it. This was exactly the case for Britain and her allies. The Gibraltar Defence Force was created, on 13 March 1941, to defend the rock and maintain British presence at one of the most crucial points of the Mediterranean Sea. The mouth of the Mediterranean was a choke point for all maritime activity in the sea and Gibraltar acted as the key to that point. Gibraltar was also the key to the strait as well and was the way into Spain from the Mediterranean. As part of the Gibraltar Defence Force, The 1st Gibraltar Brigade's significance is equal to that of the rock itself. Those that fought bravely to ensure Gibraltar remained in allied control were massive players in the scope of the war whether they knew it themselves or not.Nicholas Rankin, \\"Defending the Rock: How Gibraltar Defeated Hitler\\", 2017  Component Units  * 2nd Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) Active on Gibraltar from 13 March 1941 to 17 November 1943 \\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * 4th Battalion, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) Active on Gibraltar from 13 March 1941 to 25 April 1943\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * Independent Company, Active on Gibraltar from 13 March 1941 to 17 July 1944\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * 2nd Royal Scots, Active on Gibraltar from 22 April 1943 to 22 July 1944\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * 1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment Active on Gibraltar from 17 November 1943 to 22 July 1944\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * 30th Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment Active on Gibraltar from 22 July 1944 to 31 August 1945\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" * 31st Battalion, Suffolk Regiment Active on Gibraltar from 22 July 1944 to 31 August 1945\\"Miscellaneous British Infantry Brigades 1939-1945\\" Footnotes External links  * Gibraltar Gibraltar in World War II 1941 establishments in Gibraltar Military units and formations established in 1941 ","title":"1st Gibraltar Brigade"},{"id":"5030611","text":"Jules Bass (born September 16, 1935) is an American director, producer, composer, lyricist, and author.

Career Dickie Wells is believed to have been born on June 10, 1907 in Centerville, Tennessee, United States. His brother was trombonist Henry Wells. He moved to New York City in 1926, and became a member of the Lloyd Scott band. He played with Count Basie between 1938‚Äì1945 and 1947‚Äì1950. He also played with Cecil Scott, Spike Hughes, Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Teddy Hill, Jimmy Rushing, Buck Clayton and Ray Charles. In the middle years of the 1960s, Wells toured and performed extensively, and the onset of alcoholism caused him personal problems which led to his semi-retirement. Publication of his autobiography in 1973 helped to steer Wells back to his profession. Dicky Wells (left) and brother Henry Wells at Eddie Condon's of New York City in January 1947 In his later years, Wells suffered a severe beating during a mugging that affected his memory, but he recovered and continued to perform. He played frequently at the West End jazz club at 116th and Broadway, most often with a band called The Countsmen, led by alto saxophonist Earle Warren, his colleague from Count Basie days. A trademark was Wells's \\"pepper pot\\" mute which he made himself. Death Dicky Wells (left) and brother Henry Wells at Eddie Condon's of New York City in January 1947 He died of cancer on November 12, 1985, in New York City.

Taxonomy The mountain stream tree frog may be conspecific to the Pearson's green tree frog. Morphological differences have not been fully studied yet, but visible physical differences between frogs from Barrington Tops and Dorrigo, New South Wales, in comparison to frogs from south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales are discussed in a key on the leaf green tree frog page. These are representative of frogs described as R. barringtonensis and R. pearsoniana. Description 200px The Pearson's tree frog is a small tree frog growing up to 45 mm in length. Its dorsal surface can range from completely light green, to a mixture of green and brown, or mostly brown in color. Usually, black dots are scattered over the dorsal surface, but in some specimens, these dots may not occur. The belly is white or off white. A light brown/yellow stripe starts at the tip of the snout, across the nostril, eye, and tympanum, and then widens and dissipates over the shoulder. This line is underlined with a thicker dark brown line. The tympanum of this species is brown or mostly brown, not green. The tadpoles of the R. phyllochroa complex (R. phyllochroa, southern leaf green tree frog, R. barringtonensis and R. pearsoniana) are very similar in appearance and are difficult to tell apart; range is the best method for distinguishing tadpoles. Ecology and behaviour This species inhabits flowing creeks in rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests in highland and coastal areas. Males call from creek-side vegetation during spring and summer. The call is an \\"eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ehk\\", with the sounds getting faster towards the end of the call, almost forming a trill. The taxonomy of this species and the mountain stream tree frog is currently under review. Conservation status It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, but under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, it is considered Endangered. References * Anstis, M. 2002.

The tramway was a subsidiary of the British Electric Traction and services begun on 31 October 1902. In early 1898, three companies had applied for local tramway systems, the Barnsley Corporation applied in 1900 for a larger network than it finally built. In 1913, the company began to run motor buses to Hoyland and other points, Electric was dropped form the company name in 1919. the Barnsley company changed its name to Yorkshire Traction Co. in 1928 and abandoned tramway operation in 1930. Ignoring Oxford and Bristol, YTC is the largest bus operator to have originated from a tramway company in England. The network The Barnsley and District tramway network in 1925. The Barnsley electric tramway was a standard gauge line, running from Smithies (near Monk Bretton Colliery) to the south of Barnsley, 2 miles south of the town centre to two termini, at Worsbrough Bridge and Worsbough Dale with a junction at the crossroads of Upper Sheffield Road and Kingwell Road at the Cutting End by the present day Cutting Edge public house. The line ran from the level crossing on Old Mill Lane, down the Barnsley town centre to Sheffield Road and split in two termini down Park Road (Worsbrough) and High Street. At the road junction south of Market Place, the left fork was occupied by the Dearne & District. Both networks were virtually next to each other at this point but never connected. =Extensions= The Barnsley tramway was to be larger than it actually were but the Great Central Railway company refused the passing of tramway tracks of its own network, and prevented authorised lines to be built. One of these lines was to push the tramway away from Barnsley towards Carlton Road to the North. Other extensions were to extend the tramway into a loop on Park Road (Barnsley) in Locke Park and south from Worsborough Bridge down Park Road (Worsbrough) to Hoyland Common, this extension was also blocked by the GCR.

The shed had four running tracks and an extensive yard. Overhaul workshops were situated to the back of the shed. At the end of tramway operations the depot became a bus depot exclusively, passing to Stagecoach Yorkshire and finally closing for housing development on 20 October 2008.

The Hall, located in the Main Quadrangle on the campus, is a symbol of the university's stately history and an excellent example of Victorian Academic Gothic revival architecture. Completed in July 1859, the Great Hall soon became a tourist attraction; the writer Anthony Trollope wrote home in 1874 that the Hall was \\"the finest chamber in the colonies\\", and that no college of Oxford or Cambridge possessed a hall \\"of which the proportions are so good\\". The Great Hall, Main Quadrangle and the East Range of the University of Sydney were listed on the City of Sydney local government heritage list in 1999; where the collection of buildings are described as \\".... probably the most significant group of Gothic Revival Buildings in Australia.\\" History Designed by Sir Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817‚Äì1883), the Great Hall lies at the most northeastern point of the university Quadrangle - dominating the sweeping lawns of University Place, as well as University Avenue, which overlooks Victoria Park. Blacket was appointed Colonial Architect of New South Wales from 1849‚Äì1854. He resigned from this position in 1855 to pursue the design of new buildings for the University - supervising both their development, and construction, until their completion in 1862. Blacket's other notable achievements include the design of St. Paul's College and the alteration of the original construction of St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, from architect James Hume's original design. The Great Hall was completed in July 1859, and represents one of Blacket's finest accomplishments. On 18 July 1859, degrees were first conferred upon graduates by the University in a formal ceremony in the Hall. = Organ = During 1881‚Äì1882, a Forster & Andrews pipe organ was installed, later to be replaced in 1972 by the present organ, manufactured by Rudolf von Beckerath of Hamburg, Germany; and installed with the assistance of Ronald Sharp. The organ has three manuals and pedals, a mechanical key and electric stop action, 54 stops, 79 ranks and 4005 pipes. The cedar case was constructed in the University‚Äôs Joinery Shop, and blends with the architecture of the Great Hall. Looking towards the organ, the three manual and pedal console can be seen on the left. Above it are large principal pipes from the Great division (middle keyboard), with the rest of the Great pipes situated immediately behind these display pipes. Above the Great is the Swell division (top keyboard), which is the expressive section of the instrument enclosed in a large wooden box with front shutters operated by the Swell pedal at the console. In the centre of the gallery, jutting out into the hall, is the Ruckpositiv division (bottom keyboard), and on the right side, the Pedal division. Architecture The Great Hall is recognised as one of the finest examples of the Victorian Gothic revival style of architecture in Australia, in a design that reflects, and harmoniously complements the University Quadrangle of which it forms part. A feature of the Great Hall is the sloped roof, built in hammerbeam style to resemble that of Westminster Hall in London. The arched design of the roof is supported by six collar cedar beams, and is architecturally reminiscent of such British interiors as those of Stirling Castle, Hampton Court and Etham Castle, all equally typical of Gothic constructions. Twelve carved wooden figures of angels are located among the beams holding items that reference the arts and sciences ‚Äì Grammar has a papyrus roll, Dialectic has Aristotle‚Äôs diagram of the three syllogistic figures, Poetry has a harp, Ethics has a St Mary‚Äôs lily, Metaphysics has a symbol of the Deity, Arithmetic has an abacus, Geometry has the 47th proposition of the first book of Euclid, Astronomy has a star, Music has a lyre, and Physics has an ancient air pump. An angel of knowledge originally sat atop the eastern gable, however was removed in 1874. The marble floor, elevated upon the western side of the hall, mirrors the dais found in Westminster Hall, upon which the throne of King Richard II stood. The armorial bearings upon the southern side of the Hall, as well as the frame of the Oriel window, have been carved of Caen stone. The walls are otherwise constructed of Sydney sandstone, with a floor of marble.

He was the Wilson Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Rochester. He was born in Montezuma, Georgia. He completed undergraduate studies at Duke University in 1939 and subsequently moved to Oxford that year as a Rhodes Scholar. McKenzie worked with the Cowles Commission while it was in Chicago and served as an assistant professor at Duke from 1948‚Äì1957. Having received his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1956, McKenzie moved to Rochester where he was responsible for the establishment of the graduate program in economics. McKenzie has been the recipient of numerous professional awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973, election to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1978, the Order of the Rising Sun in 1995 and honorary doctorates from Keio University in 1998 and Kyoto University in 2004. The latter three reflect the success of his many Japanese students. McKenzie has been referred to as \\"the father of the mathematical economists in Japan\\". Work His research focused on general equilibrium and capital theory. Although most widely known as a co-creator of the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu‚ÄìMcKenzie model, he also published a book and numerous research papers, including: * \\"On Equilibrium in Graham's Model of World Trade and Other Competitive Systems\\", Econometrica, 1954. * \\"Demand Theory Without a Utility Index\\", The Review of Economic Studies, 1957. * \\"On the Existence of General Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy\\", Econometrica, 1959. * , 1976 * \\"The Classical Theorem on Existence of Competitive Equilibrium\\", Econometrica, 1981. * \\"Turnpike Theory, Discounted Utility, and the von Neumann Facet\\" Journal of Economic Theory, 1983. * \\"General Equilibrium\\", The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, 1987, v. 2, pp. 498‚Äì512. * \\"Turnpike Theory\\", The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, 1987, v. 4, pp. 712‚Äì20. * Classical General Equilibrium Theory, The MIT Press, 2002. The 1954 paper provided the first proof of the existence of a general equilibrium, using Kakutani's fixed point theorem. Another proof, by Kenneth Arrow and G√©rard Debreu, was published in the next issue of the same journal. The 1957 paper appears to include the first derivation of Shephard's lemma in the context of consumer theory. In 2014, Till D√ºppe and E.

The player travels to various levels, in the form of islands, to compete against other monkeys in an assortment of minigames. After a set number of victories, the player can then compete against a boss character. This cycle is repeated for each island visited, in increasing difficulty. Occasionally, the player will encounter unexpected battles. These challenges cannot be declined. The object of the game is collect cards and coins, eventually to the point that the player can attempt to defeat the antagonist and win. There is also a multiplayer component which includes a \\"monkey-shield\\" that ensures the second player cannot see your cards. This mode requires a second PSP and game cartridge. Reception Ape Academy 2 received mixed reviews. It currently holds a 66 out of a possible 100 on Metacritic. Game Master UK described it as \\"A real mixed bag, but if you really like monkeys and minigames, you might enjoy it.\\" References 2005 video games Ape Escape games Party video games PlayStation Portable games PlayStation Portable-only games Video game sequels Multiplayer and single-player video games Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Ape Academy 2"},{"id":"5030762","text":"Roedean School is a private day and boarding school for girls located in Parktown, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. History The school was founded in 1903 by Theresa Lawrence and her close friend, Katherine Margaret Earle: two young women in their early thirties, both educated at the University of Cambridge. They acted as joint Heads of School during the years 1903-1930\\\\. It is a sister school of Roedean School in Brighton, England which was founded by three older sisters of Theresa Lawrence, namely Penelope, Millicent, and Dorothy. The school began with 22 pupils, and was situated in a small house in Jeppestown, Johannesburg. In 1904, it relocated to its current site in Parktown, Johannesburg. Sir Herbert Baker, a prominent architect responsible for many of Johannesburg's most historical houses and monuments, designed the original school buildings. The oldest structures include St. Ursula's Building and Founder's Hall. Over the years, additions have been made, but the signature Herbert Baker features, with arches, colonnades, unwashed brickwork, and courtyards have been maintained.

Early life Coleman was born in Barry, the son of a coalminer, Albert Archer Coleman, and his wife, Winifred Marguerite. For most of the inter-war years, his father was unemployed, and did not find permanent work until 1939. This instilled in his son a lifelong belief in the evils of unemployment. He was educated at Cadoxton Boys' School and Cardiff Technical College. He later attended University College of Wales Swansea as a mature student between 1950 and 1954. He held a number of technical positions at various laboratories at Cardiff and Swansea before securing an appointment in 1954 as metallurgist to the Research Department of the Steel Company of Wales, Abbey Works, Port Talbot, in which position he remained until his election to parliament in the General Election of October 1964. Coleman had joined the Labour Party in November 1948 and became a member of the Co‚Äîoperative Party in 1955. He had also stood as a Labour candidate for Swansea Borough Council in 1960. Parliamentary career Until the 1960s, Neath was regarded, as a predominantly coal‚Äîmining constituency, as a seat where the nominee of the National Union of Mineworkers would have a considerable advantage at the selection conference. Indeed, both of Coleman's long-serving predecessors had been NUM nominees. However, Coleman, against the expectations, was chosen at the fourth ballot and thus inherited one of the safest Labour seats in the whole of Britain. Coleman served as PPS to George Thomas, Secretary of State for Wales, and was thus in effect a junior minister. He was also an opposition whip, 1970‚Äì1974, Lord of the Treasury 1974‚Äì1978, Vice-Chamberlain of the Household 1978‚Äì1979, and opposition spokesman on Welsh affairs, 1981‚Äì1983. He also served as delegate to the Council of Europe. Coleman was regarded as being on the right wing of the Labour Party and in September 1983 he backed Peter Shore, rather than his Welsh colleague Neil Kinnock for party leader and Denzil Davies, the MP for Llanelli, for deputy leader. Following Kinnock's election as leader, Coleman did not hold another front bench position. Coleman announced in early 1990 that he intended to stand down from parliament at the next General Election. Personal life Coleman was especially prominent in the public life of Neath, Swansea and West Glamorgan, and his leisure interests included membership of the chorus of the Welsh National Opera. He married, in 1949, Phyllis Eileen Williams, who died in 1963. They had one son. In January 1966 he married Margaret Elizabeth Morgan and they had one daughter. Although he had announced his retirement the previous year, Coleman remained an MP when he died on 14 January 1991. He was cremated at Margam Crematorium. Peter Hain succeeded him as MP for Neath.

Helsinki is divided into three major areas: Helsinki Downtown (, ), North Helsinki (, ) and East Helsinki (, ). The subdivisions include neighbourhoods, districts, major districts and postal code areas. The plethora of different official ways to divide the city is a source of some confusion to the inhabitants, as different kinds of subdivisions often share similar or identical names.  Neighbourhoods  Helsinki consists of 60 neighbourhoods (Finnish kaupunginosa; Swedish stadsdel). Helsinki consists of 60 neighbourhoods (kaupunginosa in Finnish; stadsdel in Swedish). The division into neighbourhoods is the official division created by the city council and used for city planning and other similar purposes. Most of the neighbourhoods have existed since the 19th century as numbered parts of the city, and official names were assigned to them in 1959. Five neighbourhoods (numbers 55 ‚Äì 59) were annexed on 1 January 2009. Today, each neighbourhood is identified by both a two-digit number between 01 and 59 and an official name in both Finnish and Swedish (in some cases they may be identical). In addition, there is an unnumbered neighbourhood called Aluemeri that consists essentially only of outer coastal water that doesn't reach to the coast. Neighbourhoods are further divided into quarters (osa-alue) and sectors (pienalue), numbered with three and four digits respectively. Sectors divide further into individual blocks and properties. = List of Helsinki neighbourhoods = Finnish names first and the Swedish names in brackets.

districts and further into sub-districts. In addition to the neighbourhood division, which exists for city planning purposes, the city is also divided into 34 districts (peruspiiri, distrikt) to facilitate the coordination of public services. The districts, which may comprise several neighbourhoods, are organised into seven major districts (suurpiiri, stordistrikt). Different quarters of a neighbourhood may belong to different districts, but individual quarters are never divided between neighbourhoods. The district division was created by a decision of the city council on 13 December 1982, when the number of different subdivisions used by different municipal departments was seen as confusing and problematic. Before the reform, in 1980, there were 101 different divisions used by the departments, of which only 17 corresponded to the official neighbourhood division. The new districts came to use within all providers of public services by 1986. = List of Helsinki districts = * 1 Helsinki southern major district ** 101 Vironniemi (Estn√§s) ** 102 Ullanlinna (Ulrikasborg) ** 103 Kampinmalmi (Kampmalmen) ** 104 Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂ (Bortre T√∂l√∂) ** 105 Lauttasaari (Lauttasaari) * 2 Helsinki western major district ** 201 Reijola (Grejus) ** 202 Munkkiniemi (Munksn√§s) ** 203 Haaga (Haga) ** 204 Pit√§j√§nm√§ki (Sockenbacka) ** 205 Kaarela (K√•rb√∂le) * 3 Helsinki central major district ** 301 Kallio (Bergh√§ll) ** 302 Alppiharju (√Ösh√∂jden) ** 303 Vallila (Vallg√•rd) ** 304 Pasila (B√∂le) ** 305 Vanhakaupunki (Gammelstaden) * 4 Helsinki northern major district ** 401 Maunula (M√•nsas) ** 402 L√§nsi-Pakila (V√§stra Baggb√∂le) ** 403 Tuomarinkyl√§ (Domarby) ** 404 Oulunkyl√§ (√Öggelby) ** 405 It√§-Pakila (√ñstra Baggb√∂le) * 5 Helsinki northeastern major district ** 501 Latokartano (Ladug√•rden) ** 502 Pukinm√§ki (Bocksbacka) ** 503 Malmi (Malm) ** 504 Suutarila (Skomakarb√∂le) ** 505 Puistola (Parkstad) ** 506 Jakom√§ki (Jakobacka) * 6 Helsinki southeastern major district ** 601 Kulosaari (Br√§nd√∂) ** 602 Herttoniemi (Herton√§s) ** 603 Laajasalo (Deger√∂) * 7 Helsinki eastern major district ** 701 Vartiokyl√§ (Botby) ** 702 Myllypuro (Kvarnb√§cken) ** 703 Mellunkyl√§ (Mellungsby) ** 702 Vuosaari (Nordsj√∂) * 8 √ñstersundom major district ** 801 √ñstersundom  Other subdivisions  Helsinki is also often unofficially divided into four distinct geographic areas. These have no absolute definitions, but they are roughly as follows. * Central Helsinki: the southern major district (except Lauttasaari) and the southern part of the central major district. * West Helsinki: the western major district plus Lauttasaari. * North Helsinki: the northern and northeastern major districts and the northern part of the central major district. * East Helsinki: the eastern and southeastern major districts. The city is also divided into postal code areas numbered between 10 and 99. Postal codes for private residences in Helsinki have the form 00xx0, where the initial '00' shows that the postal code is located in Helsinki, the next two digits show the postal code area, and the final zero indicates that the code is for a private residence (post offices use the number one, and other numbers are set aside for large businesses that have their own postal codes).

History Prior to being activated as the 730 AMS, the squadron was designated as the 630th Air Mobility Support Squadron [AMSS]. The change in designation became effective on March 15, 2001, when the 630th AMSS was inactivated and the 730th AMS activated at Yokota AB. The change was enacted to better reflect the role of the unit as more operational than support oriented. For the six years previous to the unit's inactivation, the 630th AMSS provided fixed, deployed command and control, aerial port, and maintenance required for the United States' Global Reach in the western Pacific. The squadron is part of AMC's en route system to provide fixed and deployed maintenance, aerial port and command and control support to deployed AMC forces. The squadron's mission is to provide critical en route services to deployed forces worldwide. The 630th Air Mobility Support Squadron was one of Air Mobility Command's primary Pacific hubs for air traffic. It was AMC's senior activity at Yokota and it represented other AMC organizations in the Pacific including operating locations at Fukuoka Airport and Misawa Air Base, Japan. The 630th supported all strategic/commercial airlift throughout the Pacific. The air transportation function operated the primary U.S. aerial port in Japan, providing support to U.

He is the eldest and only surviving child of former communist President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife, Elena. Biography =Early life and education= Valentin Ceau»ôescu was born in Bucharest on 17 February 1948, less than two months after the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic. His father, future President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, was an active member of the Romanian Workers' Party, earning himself various political and military positions; he was the country's Minister of Agriculture at the time Valentin was born. His mother was Elena Ceau»ôescu (n√©e Petrescu). Unlike many other members of his family, including his younger brother, Nicu, Valentin was not involved in politics. Attending the University of Bucharest, he completed his undergraduate degree in physics. In 1967, he decided to pursue further education by enrolling at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom. He played football as a goalkeeper on a college team during his time at Imperial College. =Marriages and children= On 3 July 1970, Valentin Ceau»ôescu married Iordana (Dana) BorilƒÉ (d. 2017), the daughter of communist party leader Petre BorilƒÉ. Both fathers, then political rivals, strongly opposed their children's marriage. The resulting fight, which lasted for years, eventually resulted in Dana and their child, Daniel, being exiled to Canada. Dana and Valentin were divorced in 1989. Daniel, like his father, studied to be a physicist. Valentin Ceau»ôescu remarried in 1995, and, with his new wife, he has a daughter, Alexandra. =Arrest and later life= In December 1989, during the Romanian Revolution, Valentin was arrested, along with the other members of his family. Known worldwide for their extravagant lifestyle, they were accused of undermining the economy of Romania. Valentin, himself, is said to have had a position managing the Steaua Bucure»ôti football club. He reported that he had watched the trial of his parents on television while he was under arrest. Valentin was freed from prison nine months later, after no charges were brought against him. During that time, his collection of 50 paintings by Romanian masters, engravings by Francisco Goya, and hundreds of rare books were confiscated. When he asked for restitution, the Romanian authorities argued that there are no documents which prove that he is the owner, and that the art collection belonged to the Romanian state, which promptly donated them to the National Museum of Art. Ceau»ôescu sued the government for restitution. The courts found in favour of Valentin in 2009, and ordered the museum to return forty pictures.Kimmelman, Michael. \\"Romania Shrugs Off Reminder of Its Past\\", The Daily Telegraph, 25 February 2009 Most of the works were collected by him and his former wife.

It is not a single gas but a mixture of unbreathable gases left after oxygen is removed from the air and typically consists of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. The suffix damp is believed to derive from the German word for vapours (\\"Dampf\\"). The word damp is used in similar mining terms such as white damp, fire damp and stink damp. Sources Blackdamp is encountered in enclosed environments such as mines, sewers, wells, tunnels and ships' holds. It occurs with particular frequency in abandoned or poorly ventilated coal mines. Coal, once exposed to the air of a mine, naturally begins absorbing oxygen and exuding carbon dioxide and water vapor. The amount of blackdamp exuded by a mine varies based on a number of factors, including the temperature (coal releases more carbon dioxide in the warmer months), the amount of exposed coal, and the type of coal, although all mines with exposed coal produce gas. Hazards Blackdamp is considered a particularly pernicious type of damp (especially in a historical context), due to its omnipresence where exposed coal is found, and slow onset of symptoms. It produces no obvious odor (unlike the hydrogen sulfide of stinkdamp), is constantly being reintroduced to the air (instead of being released in pockets from actively mined sections), and does not require combustion in order to be released (unlike whitedamp or afterdamp). Many of the initial symptoms of oxygen deprivation (dizziness, light-headedness, drowsiness and poor coordination) are relatively innocuous and can easily be mistaken for simple fatigue, given the physically strenuous job of coal mining. The time between the onset of initial symptoms and the start of frank asphyxiation (and rapid unconsciousness) can be as short as seconds. Thus, if the warning signs are missed, a large number of miners can be rapidly incapacitated in the same short period of time, leaving no one to summon help. In addition to the danger inside the mine, blackdamp can be \\"exhaled\\" in large quantities from mines (especially long-abandoned coal mines with few outlets for escaping gas) during sudden changes in atmospheric pressure, potentially causing asphyxiation on the surface. Disasters Modern flame safety lamp used in mines, manufactured by Koehler The gas mixture has been responsible for many deaths among underground workers, especially miners‚Äîfor example, the Hartley Colliery disaster, when 204 men and boys were trapped when the beam of an engine suddenly broke and fell down the single shaft, damaging the ventilation system and blocking it with debris. Despite rescuers' efforts, they could not be reached before they suffocated in the blackdamp atmosphere. Detection and countermeasures Historically, the domestic canary was used as an early warning against any asphyxiating gases. In active mining operations, the threat from blackdamp is addressed with proper mineshaft ventilation as well as various detection methods, typically using miner's safety lamps or hand- held electronic gas detectors. The safety lamp is merely a specially designed lantern with a flame that is designed to automatically extinguish itself at an oxygen concentration of approximately 18% (normal atmospheric concentration of oxygen is c. 21%). This low detection threshold gives miners an unmistakable warning and allows them to escape before any potentially incapacitating effects are felt.
