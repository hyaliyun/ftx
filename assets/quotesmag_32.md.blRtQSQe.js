Career Saitou debuted at Pro Tour Chicago 2000. An 83rd-place finish meant he fell just short of making money. Later the same season, he made his first standout finish by reaching the top eight of the Asia Pacific Championship. His quarter-final opponent was to have been Peter Chao of Taiwan. However, Chao was not able to attend the final day of competition, and asked Saitou for a prize split. The judges ruled this to be bribery and disqualified Saitou, Chao, and Satoshi Nakamura who had acted as their interpreter. After two seasons off tour, Saitou returned the Pro Tour in 2003‚Äì04, and to the elimination rounds at the premier level by finishing eighth at Grand Prix Nagoya. In 2005, he made his first Sunday appearance on the Pro Tour. Alongside Tomohiro Kaji, and Kenji Tsumura, he reached the top four of Pro Tour Atlanta. Saitou's team, One Spin, lost in the semifinals to the eventual champions Nova, with Saitou losing to Gabriel Nassif. In 2006, Saitou won Pro Tour Charleston as a member of Team Kajiharu80, along with Tomohiro Kaji and Shouta Yasooka. At the next Pro Tour, held in Kobe, Saitou made his first individual top eight appearance. He lost in the quarterfinals to Pro Tour first-timer and eventual champion Jan-Moritz Merkel. At the end of the 2006 season, Saitou was dubbed the PoY maker, because in the past two seasons his teammates, Tsumura and Yasooka, had won the Player of the year title. The following year, it would be his turn. In 2007, Saitou made his fourth Pro Tour top eight that year, in Yokohama, losing to Kazuya Mitamura in the semifinals. He also top eighted Grand Prix Singapore, and won Grand Prix Strasbourg. At the end of the season, he won the Player of the year title, making him the first player to do so without either winning a Pro Tour or reaching the top eight of multiple Pro Tours. The 2008 season saw Saitou finishing third at Pro Tour Berlin and making the Top 8 of three Grand Prix, but falling 20 points short of defending his title. In 2009 Saitou won back to back Extended Grand Prix in Singapore and Kobe. The following season, he made the top eight of three more Grand Prix, winning in Columbus. At Pro Tour Amsterdam it was announced that Saitou would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Two weeks before his induction Saitou was disqualified for stalling at Grand Prix Florence. He subsequently received an 18-month suspension from the DCI. One day before the Hall of Fame induction ceremony Wizards of the Coast announced that Saitou would not be inducted due to his suspension.

The pilot, First Lieutenant Dan Neubauer (28) from VMFAT-101, was the only crewmember on board the two-seat aircraft; he ejected successfully, landing in a tree. The jet crashed into the University City residential area, destroying two houses and damaging a third. A total of four residents in one house, two women and two children, were killed. A USMC investigation concluded that poor maintenance caused the engine malfunction. Errors by the pilot and USMC personnel on the ground led to the aircraft crashing into the San Diego residential neighborhood. As a result, in early 2009 the pilot was temporarily grounded and thirteen other officers and enlisted personnel were relieved and/or disciplined. The Marine Corps notified other F/A-18 squadrons of the engine and fuel problems discovered during the investigation. Crash A US Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet similar to the one involved in the accident On December 8, 2008 Lt Neubauer was piloting an F/A-18D-30-MC Hornet (Lot 12), BuNo 164017, from VMFAT-101, based at MCAS Miramar. Along with several other VMFAT-101 aircraft, he was conducting day and night carrier qualifications (catapult launches and tailhook arrested carrier landings) aboard the aircraft carrier offshore 60 miles southwest of San Diego. Neubauer was the only crewmember on board the two-seat aircraft. After taking off from the carrier at 11:11 a.m., Neubauer reported an oil caution light for the right engine, and shut it down after efforts to clear the problem failed. After declaring an emergency, he was first directed towards Naval Air Station North Island, but was redirected by superior officers to his home base of MCAS Miramar when about away from North Island. Neubauer attempted to make an arrested landing at Miramar but the jet lost power in its operating engine while on final approach. Eyewitnesses reported the jet flew slowly eastbound at a low altitude and was dumping fuel (which is not uncommon for an emergency landing). The pilot said that as he broke through the clouds at , his left engine's thrust slipped dangerously low, and he unsuccessfully tried to restart the right engine. The left engine lost more thrust, before its generator dropped offline and the jet lost electrical power. The jet flew over University City High School and crashed into the residential area just past the school about two miles from the Miramar's runway 6L. Neubauer waited \\"until the last possible moment\\" to eject from the plane, bailing out at an altitude of just , having attempted to steer away from homes on the ground before the crash. He ejected successfully, landing in a tree in Rose Canyon, just behind a home. The jet crashed into the University City residential area at Cather Ave and Huggins St (between the high school and exit 24 of Interstate 805), destroying two houses and damaging three others. A total of four residents in one house, two women and two young children, were killed.Kovach, Gretel C., \\"Five Lawsuits Pending In University City Crash\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, 30 December 2011. Neubauer was taken to a military hospital and treated for unspecified mild injuries, and reported being \\"horrified\\" by the crash at that time. Killed on the ground in one home were Youngmi Yoon, 36; her 15-month-old baby, Grace; her 2-month-old newborn daughter, Rachel; and her mother, Suk Im Kim, 60, who had recently arrived from South Korea to help care for her daughter's newborn. The other house destroyed belonged to John and Sunny Wu, who lived there with their two daughters. None of the family was home at the time of the crash but the home and everything in it were lost.Gao, Helen, \\"Two Families Who Lost Their Homes In Jet Crash Trying To Rebuild Lives\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, January 31, 2009. Aftermath In the aftermath of the crash, University City residents renewed previous calls for the US military to relocate aircraft from the base to a more remote location. In a counterpoint, homeowners in University City signed disclosure forms saying they were aware of overflying jets and that this \\"...extraordinarily rare event...got enormous publicity [and] the risk of living in University City and having a plane fall on you is millions to one.\\" Miramar was also the location of the Navy Fighter Weapons School before it was moved to the more remote Naval Air Station Fallon. Marine commanders apologized for the crash and defended the decision to order Neubauer to land at Miramar instead of North Island, which isn't surrounded by residences, stating that double-engine failures are extremely rare. Said Colonel Christopher O'Connor, Miramar's commander, \\"We are not contemplating changing our emergency procedures at this time. We very seldom fly over the area. We take being good neighbors very seriously.\\"Rogers, Rick, \\"Marines Defend Protocol For Flights\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, December 13, 2008. On December 15, 2008, Marine officials stationed in South Korea helped receive Suk Im Kim's remains at Incheon International Airport and transport them to her home in Damyang. The next day, United States Forces Korea commander General Walter L. Sharp sent a delegation to Kim's home headed by Republic of Korea Army Major General Yong-goo Jang and U.S. Marine Corps Major General Frank Panther to express condolences to Kim's son-in-law, Dong-yun Yoon.Jung, Sung-ki, \\"USFK Pays Respect to Korean Victims\\", Korea Times, December 17, 2008, p. 22. As of July 2010, in claims had been paid by the government.Kovach, Gretel C., \\"U.S., Boeing Sued Over Miramar Jet Crash\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, July 29, 2010. Youngmi Yoon's husband, Dong Yun, publicly forgave Neubauer during a news conference the day after the crash. Said Sunny Wu of the crash, \\"I don't want to blame anybody. I think everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Just as long as you can learn from your mistake, it's fine.\\" In July 2010, represented by the Los Angeles law firm Panish Shea & Boyle LLP, Yoon sued Boeing and the United States government for $56M. In the suit, Yoon alleges that the government violated many of its procedures in its operation of the mishap aircraft and that Boeing was responsible for the defects in the aircraft's fuel systems which caused the crash. Yoon later stated that the compensation offer from the US government for the loss of his four family members and his home was \\"insulting\\". Yoon's lawsuit against the US Navy was heard in a federal district court in San Diego in December 2011.Watson, Julie, \\"Family sues over F/A-18 crash that killed 4\\", Associated Press/Military Times, 12 December 2011. On 28 December 2011, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller awarded Yoon, his father-in-law, and mother-in-law's three adult children a total of $17.8 million in damage compensation from the U.S. government, Watson, Julie, Associated Press, \\"Gov't to pay family $17.8M for military jet crash \\", Stars and Stripes, being the highest wrongful death judgment against the United States and 20th highest verdict to date. 28 December 2011. the highest wrongful death judgment against the United States and 20th highest verdict to date. The US government appealed the award, and the appellate decision is pending.Moran, Greg, \\"Government Appeals $17.8 Million Jet-Crash Award\\", U-T San Diego, 7 March 2012, p. B2. The Wu family lived in a temporary home for two years until their home was rebuilt. Their homeowner's insurance did not cover all the cost of the reconstruction, temporary lodging expense, or replacement of all their lost possessions. More surprising, according to the Wu family, is that they have yet to receive any compensation from the US Navy. The family has filed a lawsuit against the US government for compensation for their damages. Said Sunny Zhuang-Wu, \\"I didn‚Äôt know the military would be so difficult.\\" Four other lawsuits against the US Navy for crash damage are pending. Investigation On March 3, 2009, an investigation by the Marine Corps concluded that the accident was preventable. The report was generally scathing in its criticism of the conduct of the participants, including the pilot. The commanding officer of the squadron, its maintenance officer, its operations officer, and the operations duty officer were relieved of duty as a result of the investigation. Nine other marines received other disciplinary action. From the report, it appeared that the jet in question had a known track record of trouble in its left engine for several months. Maintenance was deferred after mechanics detected problems in the fuel flow system, a practice that was allowed at the time under established maintenance rules and procedures (since altered to forbid this practice); the aircraft had flown 146 times since the problem was identified. When the right engine was shut down for low oil pressure, the left engine did not receive enough fuel to produce sufficient thrust for flight, leading to the crash. Forty similar aircraft throughout the fleet have been grounded to investigate similar fuel issues. Following the pilot's report of the failure of the jet's right engine, controllers aboard Abraham Lincoln, as well as a civilian air traffic controller, directed the pilot to land at NAS North Island, the closest divert field. Squadron officials, however, ordered the pilot to land at MCAS Miramar after a brief discussion, which the investigation deemed \\"collectively bad decision-making by the duty officer, by the operations officer and by the squadron's commanding officer.\\" The pilot also failed to consult his emergency procedures checklist during the emergency, as well as unnecessarily lengthening his approach to Miramar by making a 270-degree left turn after bypassing North Island, rather than a shorter 90-degree right turn. Specifically, the report criticized Neubauer for not questioning the order to divert to Miramar more forcefully, which he had briefly questioned. The squadron operations officials had underestimated the urgency of the situation, and placed undue emphasis on returning the pilot to his home field, having in mind the pilot's familiarity with that base, the longer runway, and better repair resources. Despite criticism, Neubauer was returned to a probationary flight status and allowed to resume training in late April 2009, in a decision made by Lieutenant General George J. Trautman, III, the Deputy Commandant for Aviation.

The biodiversity of farms is an aspect of agroecology.  Background  Agriculture creates a conflict over the use of land between wildlife and humans.Macdonald, Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Chapter 16 Land use for agriculture has been a driving force in creating biodiversity loss.1.^ Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Introduction The increase in the amount of pasture and crop land over the last few hundred years has led to the rapid loss of natural habitats. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that more than 40% of earth‚Äôs land surface is currently used for agriculture. Because so much land has been converted to agriculture, habitat loss is recognized as the driving force in biodiversity loss.4\\\\. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10 A decline in farmland biodiversity can be traced to changes in farming practices and increased agricultural intensity.5.^ Benton et al., 182 Nonetheless, according to the FAO, \\"biodiversity is just as important on farms and in fields as it is in deep river valleys or mountain cloud forests\\". The world has acknowledged the value of biodiversity in treaties in recent years, such as in the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. Species face habitat fragmentation which can create a genetic bottleneck.7.^ Macdonald et al., Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Ch 4 Monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop on a given piece of land, including crop rotation, produces optimum yields, but has implications for the biodiversity of farms.8\\\\. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10 Heterogeneity, the diversity of the landscape, has been shown to be associated with species diversity. Butterfly abundance has been found to increase with heterogeneity, for example. Land that is not cropped, such as fallow land, grass margins in the spaces between different fields, and strips of scrub along field boundaries increases heterogeneity, and thus the biodiversity of a farm. The plants attract insects, will which attract certain species of birds, and those birds will attract their natural predators. The cover provided by the uncropped land allows the species to move across the landscape.6.^ Benton et al., 183-184 In Asian rice, one study showed crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields could reduce pests so that insecticide spraying was reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% (Gurr et al., 2016).

Located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Saint Mary's School operates as an independent school with a historic association with the Episcopal Church including an Episcopal chapel, St. Mary's Chapel, on the school's grounds. The school formerly operated as Saint Mary's College and for many decades educated young women in grades 11-12 and their freshman and sophomore years in college. The school changed to a four year high school in 1998, at which point the name reverted to Saint Mary's School, the original name of the institution when it was founded in 1842.  School information  The school has 40 faculty members, with 83% holding advanced degrees. Enrollment for the 2019-2020 school year is 297 full-time students, representing 11 states and seven countries. The average class size is 13 students. Among the superlatives assigned to the school include the oldest continuously operated school in Raleigh, North Carolina, the third oldest girls' school in the state, and the fifth oldest girls' boarding/day school in the United States. Saint Mary's celebrated its 175th anniversary, May 12, 2017.  History  Founded in 1842 by the Rev. Aldert Smedes, an Episcopal priest, Saint Mary's School has operated continuously on the same site ever since. With the support of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina, Smedes founded Saint Mary's as a school for young ladies \\"designed to furnish a thorough and excellent education equal to the best that can be obtained in the city of New York, or in any Northern school.\\" The school was founded on the site of the Episcopal School of North Carolina, a short-lived school for boys in the 1830s. Three of the present school buildings--East Rock, West Rock and Smedes Hall--formed the original campus. East Rock and West Rock, the first two buildings, were constructed with remnant stones from the construction of the North Carolina state capitol. During the Civil War, Saint Mary's became a safe haven for relatives of both Union and Confederate generals. Smedes kept the school operating throughout the war. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman's Union troops camped in The Grove on front campus, and Sherman visited Smedes in the main building. From 1906-1908 President Woodrow Wilson's daughter Eleanor Wilson attended Saint Mary's. Today, Saint Mary's School is an innovative independent, Episcopal, college- preparatory, boarding and day school for girls in grades 9-12\\\\. The historic core of the school's 23-acre campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a stop on the North Carolina Civil War Trails. The Saint Mary's Chapel, designed by Richard Upjohn, is a National Historic Site, and five of the school's 25 buildings are Raleigh Historic Properties. Saint Mary's Chapel, built in 1856, is a National Historic Site  Campus Saint Mary's buildings date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and also include antebellum structures individually recognized as Local Historic Landmarks. Three buildings from the 1830s are visible from Hillsborough Street from behind a wooded glade of large oaks, hollies, and magnolias. The school's oldest structures, East and West Rock, are matching buildings constructed with discarded stone from the building of the second North Carolina State Capitol in the 1830s. The brick Greek Revival building between them was erected soon after; it was remodeled in 1909 to include a Neoclassical Revival front portico and dormitory wings. This main building was named Smedes Hall for the school's founder, the Rev. Aldert Smedes. Two buildings erected in the later nineteenth century are Gothic in style: the 1855 Richard Upjohn Gothic Chapel and the 1887 Gothic Revival arts building, a brick structure with pointed-arch windows. The early twentieth century saw much construction; nearly all the permanent brick buildings, which were rendered in the Colonial Revival style, survive. Later construction continued to complement earlier buildings, and the view of the campus from Hillsborough Street remains notable for its historic integrity. Saint Mary's School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as a national historic district. The district encompasses nine contributing buildings, including St. Mary's Chapel.

In keeping with the naming of the Bavarian Forest railway or Waldbahn from Plattling to Bayerisch Eisenstein, it was called the Vorwaldbahn (lit: pre- Forest railway). Construction Following the construction of the Bavarian Forest railway from Plattling via Deggendorf to Bayerisch Eisenstein, completed in 1877, and the Ilz Valley railway from Passau to Freyung, finished in 1892, the local communities situated between these routes, including Aicha, Eging and Tittling, also strove to have a railway. They favoured a stub line from Vilshofen to the north. But there was a realisation that against that, one the one hand, the land rose steeply from the Danube valley and, on the other, it would need a bridge across the Danube. After wrestling with the problem for a long time the Royal Bavarian State Railways decided to build a cross-country route between the two existing railways as the most cost- effective solution. So the Bavarian state parliament, the Landtag, decided to build a single-tracked cross-country line from Deggendorf via Eging to Kalteneck with a junction to the Ilz Valley railway, passing the requisite law on 26 June 1908. This route could also link up the harbour at Deggendorf and the market at Hengersberg to the railway network. The liability for contentious land acquisition was taken on by Deggendorf, Hengersberg and Passau on behalf of the state railway. Construction began in summer 1910 at both ends of the line. As a result, the 11.62 km long section from Deggendorf to Hengersberg and the 20.75 km long stretch from Kalteneck to Eging were opened as early as 26 November 1913 with great celebrations. The centre section, 21.66 km long, went into service on 1 August 1914 on the eve of the First World War without much ado.  Rail traffic  For the train services, the Bavarian Lokalbahn engines at the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke) of Plattling and Passau were made available. On the Deggendorf-Hengersberg line three pairs of trains ran daily for the first few months and, between Eging and Kalteneck, four pairs. The four pairs of through trains initially deployed once the line was fully opened were gradually reduced during the First World War to two pairs. Because these trains also had to take goods wagons with them the journey times on the line were long. In 1936 five pairs of trains worked the route, with trains from both directions ending in Eging in the evening and returning in the morning. In 1976 the five train pairs only ran on weekdays. On Sundays they were replaced by three bus services.  Closures  With the increase in private transport the number of passengers on this line steadily waned, although additional stops were added and operations were switched to railbuses. The freight and part-load goods traffic also suffered heavy losses. As a result, the line was closed little by little. First to go were the passenger services that were withdrawn between Eging and Kalteneck on 1 October 1972. On 3 June 1973 goods traffic from Tittling to Kalteneck ceased too. Of note is that this section was used for occasional diversions to or from Freyung and remained operational for over 20 years. The next closure again affected passenger services, this time from Deggendorf to Eging on 25 September 1981. It was followed by the cessation of goods traffic from Eging to Tittling and, with that, the closure of the entire Eging‚ÄìKalteneck section on 2 April 1995. On 2 September 2002 the same fate met the Hengersberg‚ÄìEging part of the line. After the removal of the tracks the trackbed was turned into a cycle path, which was fully opened in 2006. On the 11.6 km long remaining section from Deggendorf Hbf via Deggendorf Hafen to Hengersberg only goods traffic now plies. The Deggendorf Hafen (exclusively)‚ÄìHengersberg section was transferred on 1 September 2007 as a private industrial line to the ownership of the DHB Grundst√ºcks GmbH + Co. KG. This section is used for goods traffic serving the Schwaiger sawmill.  Sources  * Zeitler, Walther: Eisenbahnen in Niederbayern und der Oberpfalz. 2.

The main series, which currently consists of the novels Moon Called, Blood Bound, Iron Kissed, Bone Crossed, Silver Borne, River Marked, Frost Burned, Night Broken, Fire Touched, Silence Fallen, the short story \\"Hollow\\", and the most recent novel Storm Cursed, are narrated primarily from Mercy's point of view. The character also has a comic series by Dynamite which includes the prequel Homecoming, a comic adaptation of Moon Called, and an original story, Hopcross Jilly. History In the novels, Mercy Thompson is the daughter of a Blackfeet Indian and a white teenage mother. She is a \\"Walker\\" (a Native American shapeshifter not linked to the moon) who turns into a coyote, a gift she inherited from her father. A rodeo bull rider, he died a few days after consummating his relationship with her mother, Margi. In the novel Fire Touched, it is stated that her mother and father were together for a 'couple months' prior to his death. One day, not too long after Mercy was born, her mother went to the crib only to find a small coyote pup in her place. Afraid and unsure how to raise her, Margi took her to the only people she knew were capable‚Äîfriends of an uncle who had been a werewolf. This is how she came to be raised with the pack of Bran, the Marrok of the werewolves. Appearances =Moon Called= Moon Called is the beginning of the story of Mercedes Thompson. Mercy's life is not exactly normal. Her next-door neighbor is a werewolf, her former boss is a grumpy old fae, and she is fixing a Volkswagen bus for a vampire. But then, Mercy is not exactly normal herself. She's a walker, not only capable of shifting into coyote shape at will but also possessed of a sharp nose for scenting other creatures and an ability to sense magic when it is at work. So when a teenage werewolf approaches Mercy asking for work, she knows what he is immediately. She also knows it would be more prudent to refuse him, but he looks so desperate that she hires him anyway. Turns out the werewolf, who goes by Mac, has escaped from a laboratory where he was being experimented on. When bad guys show up looking for him and Mercy kills one of them, also a werewolf, she realizes it's time to turn the matter over to the local Alpha werewolf, who also happens to be her next-door divorced neighbor Adam. Before you can say \\"from the frying pan into the fire,\\" things go awry and Mercy finds and just barely saves a wounded Adam, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Jesse has been kidnapped by the same people who came after Mac. To help Adam heal, Mercy must take him to Montana, and the pack of werewolves who raised her. There we meet Bran, leader of all the North American werewolves, whose son Samuel is the man whom Mercy once loved and lost. Eventually, Adam, Samuel and Mercy return to the Tri-Cities to search for Adam's missing daughter. In the process they have encounters with fae, vampires, other werewolves, and a witch or two. Mercy must contend not only with all these creatures but with Adam and Samuel's interest in her and the territorial contentiousness that results from it. =Blood Bound= In Blood Bound we learn that Mercy is somewhat resistant to some magics such as vampire compulsion or werewolf pack control. Because of her magic resistance, vampire friend Stefan calls upon her to deliver a message to a visiting vampire who has failed to pay the proper respects to Stefan‚Äôs seethe. Stefan is fearful that the visiting vampire has some type of magic that can compel him to do things he would not ordinarily do and that Mercy is hopefully immune and will be able to report back to his seethe should anything happen to him. Of course, things go badly and soon Mercy is wrapped up in a hunt for the vampiric sorcerer Cory Littleton, who is causing the Tri Cities area to have an increased rise in violence, harming werewolf friends, and endangering lives of innocents. To complicate things, her feelings for Adam, the local Alpha, are scaring her and her feelings for Samuel, an old flame, appear unresolved. Throw in a bit of vampire, fae, and werewolf politics. =Iron Kissed= In Iron Kissed we find Mercy at a crossroads in her relationships with the two men in her life, Samuel and Adam Hauptman. Both are extremely dominant werewolves, although Samuel is a lone wolf and Adam is the alpha of the Tri Cities werewolf pack. Mercy must decide which one she loves more because Adam has declared his feelings for her and her lack of definitive response is weakening the pack. When her mechanic mentor, Siebold Adelbertsmiter a.k.a. Zee, calls upon her to repay a favor to the Fae, she is grateful for the distraction. There have been several unsolved murders on the Fae reservation and the magic on which the fae can call without incurring the wrath of the Grey Lords has been insufficient in finding the perpetrator. Mercy is called in to use her nose to see if she can find an identifying scent of the murderer. She finds their murderer, and identifies him to Zee. Shortly thereafter she learns that Zee was caught by police at the house of the Fae's killer, with the body of the murderer, and as such is charged with murder. The Fae want a quick cover-up so as not to arouse anti-fae sentiments, and Zee wants Mercy out of it so that she will not anger the Grey Lords and get herself in more trouble. Regardless, Mercy throws herself into finding the real killer and exonerating Zee. Mercy eventually figures out who did the killing but not before she is kidnapped and sexually assaulted by him. In order for her to move on, she must come to terms emotionally and physically with this tragedy. =Bone Crossed= Bone Crossed begins with the arrival of Stefan, Mercy's vampire friend, on the floor of her living room, flayed, starved, and barely recognizable. He warns her that Marsilia, the Mistress of his seethe, is aware of her involvement in the death of one of her get, Andre, and tells her to run. The Mistress has had a pair of crossed bones placed on Mercy's door, magicked so they can't be removed, as a sign to other vampires and minions that she is a traitor. While Stefan is recovering, he accidentally floods Mercy's mind with his, reliving the deaths of his menagerie, and Adam brings her into the pack to snap her out of it. The vampires place a magical trap in Uncle Mike's, the fae tavern, that kills one of the pack, though she is revived. The wolves need to negotiate peace with Marsilia, and Mercy needs to get out of town. Amber, a friend of Mercy's from college shows up to ask Mercy if she will come to their house to investigate her son's claims that there is a ghost in the house. Mercy discusses it with Adam, Samuel, and Bran, who tell her that there is only one powerful supernatural creature in Amber's home city of Spokane, the vampire Jim Blackwood, called The Monster. They believe that he will not notice her, so she will be safe there. Unfortunately, he is one of Amber's husband's biggest clients, and he has an invite to the house, including dinner the first day she's there. In the two nights she is at the house, he bites her and exchanges blood with her twice, claiming her as one of his \\"sheep\\", of which she learns Amber is another. The second night she wakes in the middle of the night to find Stefan there, and Amber's son Chad in a room full of frost, frozen to his bedclothes, and not breathing. They save Chad and advise the family to run, heading back to the Tri-Cities. Stephan exchanges blood with Mercy to claim her from Blackwood. When they get back, two rebellious vampires from the seethe (not made by the Mistress and not easily disposed of because of who their maker is) come to Stefan separately to ask him to help them remove Marsilia. He refuses, keeping his word to the Mistress. Shortly after they both have made their requests, Marsilia summons the wolves and Mercy to a 'meeting' to discuss peace. At the meeting she questions Bernard and Estelle, the rebellious vampires, with an old chair that detects whether the person sitting in it is being truthful. Then she questions Mercy and Stephan, her questions proving that he is no longer hers: this makes his testimony that of a third party, and she uses it to have Estelle killed and Bernard returned to his maker. Soon after Mercy returns home, Amber's husband Corban appears and stuns Mercy with a taser, and brings her to Blackwood because The Monster has Chad. He has killed Amber, but keeps her animated corpse around to do chores. Mercy, Chad, Corban, and a tree fae called Oakman are kept in cages under the house. Blackwood can absorb the power of whatever person/creature he feeds on. The Oakman allows him to be active in daylight, and Mercy's walker blood will allow him to command ghosts. Stefan finds her, and she convinces him to save Chad, on the condition that should she survive, he will be forgiven for the deaths of the two people he had killed in Blood Bound. The fae walking stick shows up and Mercy gives it to the Oakman on his request. She escapes her cage, and while she is fighting Blackwood, the fae throws it at the vampire's back, staking him. Stefan and Mercy return to the Tri-Cities, where Stefan learns that Marsilia did not kill his people, but merely cut his ties to them so that he would think them dead. He agrees to return to the seethe, but on his own terms. =Silver Borne= When mechanic and shapeshifter Mercy Thompson attempts to return a powerful Fae book she'd previously borrowed in an act of desperation, she finds the bookstore locked up and closed down. It seems the book contains secret knowledge-and the Fae will do just about anything to keep it out of the wrong hands. And if that doesn't take enough of Mercy's attention, her friend Samuel is struggling with his wolf side-leaving Mercy to cover for him, lest his own father declare Sam's life forfeit. All in all, Mercy has had better days. And if she isn't careful, she might not have many more to live... =River Marked= Car mechanic Mercy Thompson has always known there was something different about her, and not just the way she can make a VW engine sit up and beg. Mercy is a shapeshifter, a talent she inherited from her long-gone father. She's never known any others of her kind. Until now. An evil is stirring in the depths of the Columbia River‚Äîone that her father's people may know something about. And to have any hope of surviving, Mercy and her mate, the Alpha werewolf Adam, will need their help... =Frost Burned= Mercy and her stepdaughter Jesse are on a shopping trip. Startled by Jesse's question when she (Mercy) and her father are having a baby, Mercy crashes her car, the \\"Rabbit\\", into an SUV. Jesse tries to call her dad, but he doesn't pick up. Mercy gets worried and tries to reach him through their mating/pack bond, but she only feels anger, rage and pain. Something isn't right. Also no other member of the pack picks up their phones. A weird message from Bran (The Marrok, ruler of the North American werewolves) arrives ... \\"The Game is Afoot\\" ... =Night Broken= Adam's ex-wife (Christy Hauptman) calls in, she is in distress. A lover she met is chasing her and she needs protection. Mercy agrees to take her in and to find out what is happening. Beside her problems Christy tries to paint Mercy in a bad light. Christy isn't Mercy's only problem. The night of Christy's arrival a Gray Lord (Alistair Beauclaire) shows up. He wants the walking stick back, which Mercy had given to Coyote. Now she needs to find Coyote, which isn't as easy as it may seem ... =\\"Hollow\\" (short story)= After considering the future of her mechanic shop, Mercy is approached by a woman named Lisa to handle a ghost haunting the home of a rich man. Along with the newest pack member Zack, Mercy investigates the trouble only to discover it is much worse than expected. =Hopcross Jilly (comic)= While taking a quick run during the full moon, Mercy and Adam's pack come across a ritual burial site with skeletal remains of four children. Across the site is an old abandoned house that was once owned by an old and mysterious woman known as Hopcross Jilly. They discovered that she was an ancient fae that hunted down naughty children to eat their fingers and toes and bury their bodies in the cardinal directions. Meanwhile, Mercy's stepdaughter Jesse is having a tough time at school due to both the recent discovery of the burial sites and being the daughter of a werewolf. During this rough period, she befriends a new student named Jill who appears friendly to Jesse, yet acts strange. =Fire Touched= After encountering a troll, Mercy takes a young boy into the packs' protection while declaring the Tri- cities their territory against all others. The young boy, a fire touched human who had been snatched by the fae centuries earlier and trapped in underhill since, is wanted by the fae for the power he possesses. Mercy's declaration has long reaching consequences, and to stave off a possible war, Bran sunders her pack from the packs of America, leaving them to face the consequences alone. =Silence Fallen= Mercy has found her voice in the werewolf pack. But when Mercy's bond with the pack and her mate is broken, she'll learn what it truly means to be alone... =Storm Cursed= After Mercy declares the Tri- Cities under the protection of the pack in Fire Touched, Mercy and Adam's home became a neutral ground - a place where humans would feel safe to come and treat with the fae. The reality is that nothing and no one is safe. As generals and politicians face off with the Gray Lords of the fae, a storm is coming and her name is Death. Released May 2019. =Smoke Bitten= Confirmed title of next installment; announced release date of March 17, 2020.http://www.patriciabriggs.com/books/SmokeBittenSnippet1.shtml Characterization =Physical appearance= Mercy is described in the novels as being of average height, around 5‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥, and average weight with long, straight, dark brunette hair (often kept in braids).

Identifying marks include a tattoo of a coyote paw print on her belly, below her navel, and buckshot scars on her behind. In coyote form, she weighs 32 lbs. Her adoptive parents died when she was fourteen, which happened 17 years ago, which makes her 31 years old. =Personality traits, abilities, and interests= Mercy is described as being stubborn, headstrong, independent, hardworking, thoughtful, caring, and having a faith that has saved her at least once from a 'Vampire Queen'. She can change between human and coyote form at will. In coyote form, she is slightly faster, has much better sight in the dark, and a slightly better sense of smell. In both human and coyote form, she has an acute sense of smell and a resistance to some forms of magic. It has been shown that she has the ability to see (and control) ghosts. It is explained that this is the reason Walkers are so rare‚Äîvampires have hunted them down to prevent them from being \\"vampire hunters\\" because wherever vampires reside, there are usually ghosts of victims to reveal them. She works as an auto mechanic and deliberately annoys her neighbor Adam, keeping increasingly decrepit and dismantled cars on her lawn (For a good time call...). =Character history= Mercy grew up in Bran's (i.e. the Marrok, a name taken from King Arthur's round table) pack because her teenage mother did not know how to raise her, as she had no knowledge of the supernatural prior to seeing her baby turn into a coyote. Her mother had been in a relationship with Joe Old Coyote (a young rodeo rider) who died before they found out she was pregnant. Joe Old Coyote was a real person that the Native American god Coyote walked in for a time (more or less making Mercy the 'daughter' of Coyote). Hence her ability to turn into a coyote at will. Joe Old Coyote was killed by vampires (who made it look like a car accident) because he had destroyed a nest prior to getting involved with Mercy's mother. Coyote claims he got his inspiration from Star Wars. At a young age, Mercy almost ran away with Sam/Samuel because she thought they were in love. Bran warned her that he mostly only wanted her as a \\"Brood Mare\\" because she could bear him children, unlike female werewolves who cannot carry a child to term. At that point she left the Marrok's pack and returned to live with her mother until graduating from college with a degree in history and later finding work as a mechanic for a grumpy old fae named Zee.

In 1806, he entered into his father's regiment and participated in the unhappy campaign of that year. In 1809, he participated with his older brother Eugen in an uprising against the French occupation forces. This ended in their fleeing to England in 1809. Both joined the Spanish dragoons in their struggles against the French. His brother was killed in battle in 1811. Lieutenant Moritz received severe wounds two times in battle, and ended in French captivity. He escaped in 1813, under very dangerous circumstances. His 15 wounds made him barely recognizable when he received a medal for his actions. In 1814 he participated in the campaign in France as a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish army. Hirschfeld returned to the Prussian army in 1815, and in the succeeding peaceful years climbed the ranks in the military. 1849 found him commander of the 15th division of the Prussian army under the command of the Prince of Prussia. He participated in the battles which drove the rebel army out of the Palatinate and into the arms of the [Baden] forces under Mieroslawski. After relieving the Landau fortress, which was in the hands of the officers who had not gone over, he led two divisions against Mieroslawski. At Wagh√§usel, he obligated that numerically far greater force to retreat. Then he participated in the battle at the Murg which obligated the rebel army to disperse and resulted in the collapse of the uprising.

It is the administrative seat of the municipality of Villanueva. Name Villanueva was founded on February 4, 1692 under the name Villagutierre del √Åguila. Like many towns in Mexico, the name of the patron saint of the town was added to the name and it became Villa de San Judas Tadeo de Villa Gutierre del √Åguila. However, since it was the last town founded in that area of Zacatecas, it was called Villa Nueva (new town), and that is the name that stuck. Geography  Villanueva is one of the 58 municipalities of the Mexican state of Zacatecas. It is located at the southern part of Zacatecas and is bordered in all directions by a number of Zacatecas municipalities. Among the municipalities bordering it are Jerez to the north, Genero Codina to the east, Tabasco to the south and Tepetongo to the west. Some parts of Villanueva have mountainous terrains. It is also crossed by different rivers and other bodies of fresh water. It has a sub-humid temperature and an annual average of 16.9 ¬∞C.  Climate  History The municipality was originally called Santa Cruz when it was founded in 1650. Its name was changed a couple of times until 1962, when it was officially renamed as the Municipality of Villanueva, its name until the present. Its seal is one of the oldest in Zacatecas, dating back as early as the early 19th century. The motto of the town is the Latin translation of \\"With the sword and the plow\\". It is because Villanueva began as an agriculture and labor-based community and produced some of the bravest patriots in Mexico. Once a colonial town, Villanueva only became a free municipality in the year 1917. As of 2005, Villanueva had a population of 28,760 residents. The majority of these residents are Roman Catholics by faith. Economy and culture The primary sources of income in Villanueva are agriculture, cattle raising and fishing. Following it are the manufacturing, construction and electricity industry. Commerce and tourism over the years have also become sources of income for the municipality. Villanueva has great potential to be developed as a tourism hot spot because of its attractive colonial architecture. It has plenty of historical sites to visit. Among these are pre-Hispanic petroglyphs, the properties of the old colonial invaders, the parochial temple of San Judas Tadeo, the Municipal Palace and a whole lot more. The annual feast from October 20‚Äì28 is also one of the most joyous celebrations in Villanueva. It is held in honor of their patron saint San Judas Tadeo and is reveled with merriment, dances, food and games. Some popular events are the Fair of Tayahua every March 14‚Äì20 and the religious celebration of the Incarnation of The Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmen every July 16 among others. Culture People in Villanueva are musically inclined. In fact, it is the place of origin of the musical genre called tamborazo. It is also rich in craft products such as wood and leather furniture. The place also has a number of original delicious Mexican recipes to feast on. On account of its many vacation attractions, it has been a preference by both local and foreign tourists. To cater to the tourists that flock Villanueva ever year, the municipality has ensured that there is available a number of resorts, spas and activities to accommodate their guests. Villanueva, is well known for its music and rich culture. Villanueva has one of the largest \\"Unidad Deportivas\\" in the state of Zacatecas.

Laurence Graff purchased the Wittelsbach Diamond in 2008 for ¬£16.4 million. In 2010, Graff revealed he had had the diamond cut by three diamond cutters to remove flaws. The diamond was now more than lighter and was renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond. There is controversy, as critics claim the recutting has so altered the diamond as to make it unrecognisable, compromising its historical integrity. Wittelsbach Diamond The Wittelsbach diamond, before being recut by Graff. The original Wittelsbach Diamond, also known as Der Blaue Wittelsbacher, was a fancy, deep, greyish-blue diamond with VS2 clarity that had been part of both the Austrian and the Bavarian Crown jewels. Its colour and clarity had been compared to the Hope Diamond. The diamond had measured in diameter and in depth. It had 82 facets arranged in an atypical pattern. The star facets on the crown were vertically split, and the pavilion had sixteen needle-like facets arranged in pairs, pointing outward from the culet facet. History Maria Amalia of Austria's bridal portrait shows the large blue diamond as the centerpiece in her hair ornament. Detail from a painting by Frans van Stampart, 1722. The Wittelsbach Diamond in the Crown of Bavaria, just beneath the cross. The diamond originates from the Kollur mines of Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh, India. The story that King Philip IV of Spain purchased the jewel and included it in the dowry of his teenage daughter, Margaret Teresa, in 1664 is apocryphal. The first time the diamond was mentioned is about fifty years later when it was already in Vienna. It was in the possession of the Habsburg family and came to Munich when, in 1722, Maria Amalia married Charles of Bavaria, a member of the Wittelsbach family. In 1745, the Wittelsbach Diamond was first mounted on the Bavarian Elector's Order of the Golden Fleece. When Maximilian IV Joseph von Wittelsbach became the first King of Bavaria in 1806, he commissioned a royal crown that prominently displayed the diamond. Until 1918, the jewel remained on top of the Bavarian crown. It was seen last in public at Ludwig III of Bavaria's funeral in 1921. The Wittelsbach family tried to sell the diamond in 1931 during the Great Depression but found no buyers. It eventually sold the jewel in 1951.Dr√∂schel/Evers/Ottomeyer (Lit.) In 1958, the stone was exhibited at the World Expo in Brussels. In the 1960s, the Goldmuntz family asked Joseph Komkommer, a jeweller, to re-cut the diamond, but Komkommer recognised its historical significance and refused. Instead, he joined a group of dealers that bought it. The diamond had been in a private collection since 1964; Helmut Horten had presented to his wife Heidi at their wedding. On 10 December 2008, the Wittelsbach Diamond was sold to London-based jeweller Laurence Graff for ¬£16.4 million sterling, or US$23.4 million, at the time the highest price ever paid at auction for a diamond. (The previous record had been held by a pear-shaped stone named the Star of the Season.) The record was eclipsed on 16 November 2010, when a 24.78 carat pink diamond was sold for ¬£29 million Sterling, or US$46 million, again to Mr. Graff. In June 2011, Graff apparently sold the diamond to the former emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa, for at least US$80 million.Evers/M√∂ckl/N√∂th (Lit.), P. 363 =Alteration= Immediately following the sale, Graff announced his intention to recut the gem to remove damage to the girdle and enhance the colour. On 7 January 2010, it was reported that the diamond had been recut to enhance the stone's colour and clarity, losing over in the process. The resulting stone has been renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff. The move was met with heavy criticism by some experts: Gabriel Tolkowsky called it \\"the end of culture.\\" Shortly after the auction of the diamond, American gem cutter and replicator of famous diamonds Scott Sucher stated, \\"In the case of the Wittelsbach, what's at stake is at minimum over 350 years of history, as every nick, chip, and scratch has a story to tell. Just because we can't decipher these stories doesn't mean they don't exist.\\" The alteration of the historical stone has been compared by Professor Hans Ottomeyer, director of the Deutsches Historisches Museum of Berlin, to the overpainting of a painting by Rembrandt. It is opined that the recutting was done to increase its market value and, by extension, that of other \\"fancy diamonds\\". As a result of the recut, which removed some chips and reduced the size of the culet by 40%, the gem has been re-evaluated by the Gemological Institute of America and its colour grade revised from \\"fancy deep grayish-blue\\", the same grade given by GIA to The Hope, to the more desirable \\"fancy deep blue\\". The diamond's clarity had also been revised upward from \\"very slightly included\\" (VS1) to \\"internally flawless\\" (IF).

Harold Murray in a publicity photo published in a newspaper for his performance in Springtime of Youth, 1922 J. Harold Murray (born Harry Rulten, February 17, 1891 ‚Äì December 11, 1940) was an American baritone singer and actor. For more than a decade, during the Roaring Twenties and the Depression Thirties, he contributed to the development of musical theater by bridging vaudeville, operetta and the modern American musical. The most popular American songs he introduced on Broadway included \\"Autumn in New York\\" (1934, Thumbs Up!, words and music by Vernon Duke); \\"Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee\\" and \\"Soft Lights and Sweet Music\\" (1932, Face the Music, Moss Hart and Irving Berlin); \\"Rio Rita\\", \\"The Kinkajou\\" and \\"The Rangers Song\\" (1927, Rio Rita, Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy); and \\"Mandalay\\" (1921, The Whirl of New York, (Gustave Kerker, Hugh Morton and Edgar Smith). Biography Born on February 17, 1891 in South Berwick, Maine, \\"Hal\\" Murray served in the Merchant Marine during World War I. After the war and a short apprenticeship in vaudeville, he made his debut on the musical theatre stage as J. Harold Murray in out-of-town productions of Arthur Hammerstein's Always You and Frank Tinney's Sometime, both in 1920. He debuted on Broadway at the age of 30 in J.J. Shubert's, The Passing Show of 1921. During the rest of the decade, he starred in 10 musicals, and separately co-starred with Eddie Cantor (Make It Snappy, 1922), Fred Allen (Vogues of 1924) and Joe E. Brown (Captain Jinks, 1925). Other shows were: The Midnight Rounders of 1921, The Whirl of New York (1921), Springtime of Youth (1922), Caroline (1923), China Rose (1925) with Olga Steck, and Castles in the Air (1926) with Vivienne Segal. In February 1927, he starred in Rio Rita, a Flo Ziegfeld production. It was so successful after it opened the Ziegfeld Theatre that the musical Show Boat, which had been scheduled to open in April, was delayed until the end of the year. In Hollywood from 1929‚Äì30 in the pre-Code years, Murray appeared in the William Fox Studio musicals: Cameo Kirby with Norma Terris; Happy Days; Married In Hollywood with Norma Terris; Women Everywhere (1930) with Fifi D'Orsay; and Under Suspicion. Returning to New York City, Murray starred in the Moss Hart- Irving Berlin musical Face the Music, Oscar Hammerstein II's East Wind,, Thumbs Up, and Venus in Silk. The latter was a Laurence Schwab operetta that closed out-of-town (Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.) before reaching Broadway. Murray retired from the Broadway stage in 1935. He sang on a Hartford, Connecticut radio show weekly for three years. He also was active in business, and summer stock (The Only Girl, 1938; Knickerbocker Holiday, 1939, at The Player's Theatre, Clinton, Connecticut). He performed in several musical film shorts for Universal Pictures (Nite in a Night Club, 1934; The Singing Bandit, 1937; Somewhere in Paris, 1938; Wild and Bully 1939), RKO (Phony Boy, 1937; Under a Gypsy Moon 1938) and Vitaphone (Who Was That Girl, 1934; The Flame Song, 1934). Murray developed nephritis in the spring of 1940. He died of the disease on December 11 at the age of 49. Modern theater musicals emerged from vaudeville and operettas, and J. Harold Murray played an important role in their early development. His acting and strong baritone performances of songs, such as \\"Rio Rita\\", \\"The Ranger‚Äôs Song\\", \\"Let‚Äôs Have Another Cup of Coffee\\", \\"Soft Lights and Sweet Music\\", and \\"New York in Autumn\\" were notable then. His introducing them on the Broadway stage contributed to their withstanding the test of time into the 21st century.

Sise (1906‚Äì1974) was a Canadian architect, educator, and humanitarian.  Early life and education  Sise was born in 1906 in Montreal, Quebec. His father was president of the Northern Electric Company, and his uncle president of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada. He attended Selwyn House School in Montreal and Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Quebec. He studied at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario but left after his second year because he decided to become an architect. He was greatly influenced to study architecture by discovering wonderful folios of the works of Christopher Wren in the Royal Military College of Canada library. He was able to transfer from second-year at Royal Military College into second-year at the School of Architecture at McGill University. After two years of study at McGill (1925‚Äì27), he transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge where he graduated in 1929. After graduation, he went to London, England, to do post-graduate studies in architecture and town planning.  Career  He was employed at Le Corbusier‚Äôs architectural office in Paris, France, and the Howe and Lescaze firm in New York City. Upon his return to Montreal in 1931, he participated in the establishment of the Atelier school, which held art classes, lectures and exhibitions. The Atelier School's aim was to bring together artists interested in modern painting, while stressing the importance of classical principles in art, and the art of the European moderns. He wrote, 'The essential qualities of a work of art lie in the relationships of form to form, and of colour to colour. From these the eye, and especially the trained eye derives its pleasure and all artistic emotion must find its expression through these means.' He was involved in the arts and theatre communities in Montreal. He regularly attended the gatherings held at painter John Lyman‚Äôs home, developing friendships with artists such as Andr√© Bi√©ler, Jean Palardy, and Jori Smith. He participated in the Fourth International Congress of Modern Architecture in Athens. He was interested in creating a link between the artist and the public, for example through the promotion of mural painting. He was interested in the international situation during the thirties. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he joined the Canadian Blood Transfusion Unit, which was run by Communist Party activist Dr Norman Bethune in the Loyalist (Republican Government) zone, based in Madrid. He often drove a Red Cross Ambulance (1936-9). He later became the chief fundraiser for the Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy and on at least one occasion acted as an interlocuter for agents of the Soviet Union active among pro-Republican forces. Returning to Canada just before the beginning of World War II, he joined the Staff of the National Film Board of Canada serving first in Ottawa, Ontario and later in Washington, D.C. After the war, he was invited to give lectures in architectural history at McGill University School of Architecture. Since he was engaged in the practice of the profession of architecture, his practical experience complemented theoretical studies. In Montreal, he was an active member of the city's Parks and Playgrounds Association, contributing to the restoration and preservation of urban open spaces. He cofounded the architectural co-operative known as Arcop, the successor firm to Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, Sise in 1955. He was an outspoken advocate of social justice and a faithful follower of the modern movement. He was concerned with the furtherance of modern art and architecture, not only in Montreal but across Canada. In 1968, he retired from the architectural co- operative.  Later life  From 1970‚Äì74, he consulted with the National Capital Commission on saving of traditional architecture. He died in 1974.

They are mostly found in China, Laos, Thailand, Burma, and Vietnam, and some have emigrated to the United States of America. There are however two different groups of Tai people called Tai Nua, one in China and Burma, the other in Laos. Names Tai Nua can be written as Tai Neua, Tai Nuea, Tai N√ºa, or Dai Nua, and sometimes Tai Nau. They are also known as Dehong Dai in China, or Chinese Shan. The word Nua (‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∑‡∏≠) in the Tai languages means \\"north\\", Tai Nua (‡πÑ‡∏ó‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∑‡∏≠) therefore means \\"northern Tai\\", and is used by Tai people to refer to other Tai groups living to the north. However, the naming of the Tai people can be confusing; some publications may also use Dai Kong, Dai Loe, Tai Mao and others, and two different groups of Tai people are called Tai Nua. History Tai Neua people in Laos Tai Neua was one of many ethnics in China who prospered during 17th and 18th century. They came from an area referred to as Muang Neua, and were called Tai Muang Neua. The former kingdom of the Tai Nua people had its capital at Muang Boo; other main cities included Muang Khwan, Muang Guoen Mai. Tai Neua had many warlords of their own which they referred to as Jao Fa ( Lord of Sky ) There were many Jao Fa or Khun descent to as late as early 19th century. There are still many Tai Neua villages in China that are still preserving their own heritages. Although Tai Neua in China are considered as a small minority group, they still have many of their relatives living in many countries in South East Asia, Europe and America. Some of Tai Neua escaped depredation from China during early 19th century and divided into 3 different routes as they reached Laos, Thailand and Burma. Tai Neua in Laos are found in 9 villages, including Ban Koum, Ban Patoy, Ban Nam Keoluang, Ban Siriheuang and Ban Tong Mai. There are as many as 16 villages of Tai Nuea people living in Kiang Tung ( Xiang Tung ) Burma. five of the villages located right inside the town of Xiang Tung such as: Xao Paed, Bo Heua, Nong Kham, Pa Laeng and Suan Luang. Since Laos civil war in the middle of 1960, some Tai Neua had fled Muang Sing to escape newly communist control in Muang Sing to Bokeo province and settled in 25 km to the North of Ban Houeisai called Ban Namkeung Mai. This little slope area along the Mekong river is first settle by Yao or Mien ethnic during the CIA war. Chao La was chief of this village. His family and the families of other Mien officials and military members. Tai Neua fled from Muangsing during 1965 to settle in Nam Keung Mai with few families then when Nam Touiy was lost to communist in early 1973 all of Tai Neua in Nam Touiy fled to join the rest of Tai Nuea in Ban Namkeung Mai. Although, a few families had fled to other countries after Laos lost its war to total communist control in early 1975. Those who fled from Ban Namkeung Mai are now reside in America, France, Switzerland and Canada. Today, more than 30 of Tai Neua families still living in Ban Namkeung Mai, Laos. Ban Namkeung Mai has become the 6th village of Tai Nuea in Laos. Demographics Today, most of the Tai Nua people live in China, where they are classified with related Tai peoples as the Dai people, one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. The number is estimated at be around 540,000 in China (2001 census), around 700,000 in total including other countries. The Tai Nua people are Buddhist, but mixed with animism and polytheism. Language The Tai Nuea language is closely related to other Tai languages. It has its own scripts, the Tai Le or Dehong Dai script, which is used in Yunnan, China. However, the Tai Nua people of the Houaphanh Province in Laos speak a different dialect from the Tai Nua of Yunnan and Burma; the one spoken in Yunnan is a Southwestern Tai dialect, while the Laotian one has Northern Tai features. Culture The Tai Nua people have their own culture, tradition, language and literature. Among their many festivities is the New Year \\" Jin Leun Sam \\", which is normally falling on the first day of the third month of lunar calendar. New year celebration is consider very important festival in the Tai Neua tradition. Those living outside of the hometown would return for the celebration with the family and friends. The festivities could go on a week long with many activities such as riding swing set \\" Ki Tong Ja \\", spinning tops, and competitions \\"Toh Mark Khang\\" and tossing bean bags \\" Peak Gon \\". This is the time for all the kids to ask for forgiveness from their elders \\" Su Ma \\" by preparing a plate off offering with flowers, candles, incenses. The kids then kneel in front of elders and offer the plate with asking for intentional or unintentional mishaps that they may have imposed upon their elders, then the elders would give them the word of forgiveness and bless them with New Year's blessings and tie their wrists with white string to signify the sacrament of the procession. It is also the time for Tai Neua people to make traditional cake such as Sesame rice cake \\" Khao Pook Nga \\"; rice ball cake \\" Kao Ke Mah \\" and people would invite friends and family to join with special meals throughout the week long until the very first day of New Year \\" Meu Ho Leun Sam \\" then the festivity will be held at the temple for the big and final celebration with the blessing of the monks.

Young Jr. Young explores the lives of impoverished young black men living in the near New West Side of Chicago, Illinois in order to get a better understanding of how they view their lives and what they want for their futures. The book was first published in 2004 by Princeton University Press.  Reception  The book received a generally positive reception, garnering reviews from academic journals including Contemporary Sociology, Gender & Society, Journal of Urban Affairs, and the American Journal of Sociology. Characters Larry - A 24-year-old male who has never held a full-time job for longer than a month or two. Because he cannot find and hold a job he still lives at home with his parents and siblings. Devin - A 21-year-old active gang member who is on parole for possession of narcotics. He has been a part of many illicit activities such as selling drugs and theft. Devin has never held any form of a job in his life. Casey - A 25-year-old ex-convict who just got out of drug rehabilitation for an addiction that started when he was a teenager. He had a job as a bag boy at a local supermarket but besides that the majority of his income came from hustling and drug dealing. Lester - Grew up with both parents, and had a plan to excel in his future. Unfortunately his parents were criminals, and once his father was incarcerated he had to stop focusing on school and start focusing on survival. It was then that he resorted to becoming a drug dealer. Earl - Comes from a family that was unfamiliar with college because nobody was fortunate enough to have experienced it. He moved to Near West from Mississippi, and was often teased and picked on as an adolescent. Eventually Earl found a sense of security from being an outsider by joining a gang. Jake - Was one of few to receive his high school diploma. Unfortunately, college was out of the question as his family did not have the finances to help him out. Eventually Jake fell into the easy money-making system of drug dealing. Barry - He stayed away from gangs growing up, and was able to receive his high school diploma, but he got caught up in drug dealing to make quick and easy cash during the summer shortly following his graduation. He eventually stopped when the police were catching on to him, and drug dealing gangs wanted him dead. Donald - Worked many different jobs during his adolescent years, but was unable to keep any of them for very long. Eventually being desperate for money led him down the path of drug dealing. Gus - A high school football star who had plans to participate in the army. Unfortunately his addiction to cocaine hurt his athleticism, and got him kicked out of the military. He eventually came back to Near West, where he began dealing drugs. Tito - A survivor of Near West Side who was able to work with a moving company for a short period of time. Eventually he began gangbanging, and was incarcerated.  Synopsis  Introduction - Making New Sense of Poor Black Men in Crisis The introduction gives insight on what is to come later in the book. It also describes the setting and how Young did his research. Young conducted his research in several public housing developments in the Near West Side of Chicago. Young describes the area as \\"geographically and socially isolated from downtown Chicago and the opulent western suburbs, and resembles a holding pen for the economically immobile.\\" The first development that Young went to was the Governor Henry Horner Homes. The development had \\"19 buildings with 1,774 units, almost all of which are occupied by African Americans.\\" In these households over 85% received public assistance, and only 8% were able to be supported by the employment of a member of the household. The second development was the ABLA homes located one and a half miles away from the Henry Horner Homes. This development contains 160 buildings with 3,505 units and, like the Henry Horner homes, is almost all African-American. ABLA occupants do a little better financially, with 75% needing public assistance and just over 8% able to support themselves. The second half of the introduction talks about what made Young want to research and write this book and what the main themes of the book are. Young says that the main goal of this book is to \\"uncover these men's worldviews on issues such as mobility, opportunity, and future life chances.\\" The book is not about what was going through these men's heads when they were dealing drugs or carrying a firearm but instead about how they view their place in American society and what they think about their futures. Chapter 1 - The Past and Future of the Cultural Analysis of Black Men Chapter 1 starts off by going into the idea of \\"the crisis of the black male,\\" which is the idea that the rate of crime and incarceration among blacks is directly connected to their high rate of unemployment. Young attributes the crisis to two key factors: structural factors such as race-based residential segregations and mobility prospect, and cultural factors such as attitudes and behaviors that prevent acceptance into the work world. Young then talks about how most research on poor black males only focuses on behavioral traits and their value systems. He says that good research would also include a deep analysis of how these men create their worldviews and beliefs regarding the present and future. Cultural analysis is the topic of a huge debate right now. On one side \\"the debate asks whether black men adopt or promote distinct cultural patters that contribute to, if not cause altogether, their demise.\\" The other side questions \\"whether these men, who are taken to be cultural actors in the ways that other groups of Americans are, might simply experience unique life circumstances and conditions that overdetermine the social outcomes comprising their everyday lives.\\" Young then finishes off the chapter talking about social isolation which is the idea that these poor young black men are unable to get jobs because their class standing keeps them away from mainstream society. They are isolated from the areas where the jobs and opportunities are. Chapter 2 - Time, Space, and Everyday Living Chapter 2 looks at the everyday lives of these men. Uncertainty is a common feeling for them because each day they must worry about whether they will have a job or even make it through the day. One thing in this chapter that really surprised Young was the men's inability to manage time. They would show up late, extremely early, or even on the wrong days to interviews. These men do not have to deal with appointments on an everyday basis because on the majority of their days they have nothing to do, so they do not know how to handle appointments. Young brings up the concept of Habitus, which is a \\"system of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.\\" Essentially, the way people think and act is related to the social constraints and structures around them. Young gives the example of how the use of violence in order to defend oneself is a justifiable in certain situations. Young was surprised by how much these people have to deal with violence. He talks about how in most communities violence is rare but in the Near West Side it has become part of the daily lives of the people. Most people only feel unsafe when they go out late at night but people in the Near West Side fear violence all day, even in their own homes. Chapter 3 - Coming Up Poor Coming Up Poor addresses the issue of young African-American men developing their futures through the obstacles of growing up in Near West Side. The most common obstacles that most of the men experienced were the lack of decent finances, a father figure, a sense of security, and the proper information to lead them to college. Young men are interviewed and asked to describe what it was like trying to grow up in the community and what kind of support they received from their family to pursue an education beyond high school. When discussing their upbringing the men speak of how the community was extremely violent, and quite often the children in elementary school had other things on their mind other than getting a quality education. Survival of the gang-infested area, the home that was full of stress and anxiety due to the lack of money, and earning the respect of peers no matter what it took were the main focuses of these adolescents. When asked about their parental figures' attitude towards achieving a higher level of education, they all had the same answer. All of the parents stressed how important it was to receive a quality education and stay off the streets and out of gangs. Although their parents wanted nothing more for their children but to grow up and do something with their life, they were unable to provide concrete information or help to guide the children in the correct direction. Some parents overprotected their children to the point where the children would sneak out to the streets and be exposed to gang violence. One often found a sense of safety and security only in joining a gang to avoid being the recipient of a soft reputation. To find security in the streets one had to gain the respect of one's peers. When kids are bullying, stealing, and dealing drugs when in elementary school, the future for that generation is limited to those who can stay away and deal with the conflicts another way. The local high school had an enrollment of 97 percent African Americans, and during the 1980s the percent who received a high school diploma only ranged from 15 percent to no more than 30 percent. The high school could not provide what one would call a safe and educational learning environment for many different reasons. During daily instruction students would have to halt their studies and duck beneath their desks because of gunfire in the streets. With instability such as this one can only imagine the quality of an education that a student could receive, which is why the percent of students who went on to attend college ranged from 10 percent to no more than 40 percent. This does not mean that those eligible to go to college were able to afford it, considering that 95 percent of the students came from low-income families that needed financial assistance to survive. Once these boys became men and were still stuck in the city, they believed that they had survived the most challenging part of growing up. Now they were off to the workforce, where many were unable to keep steady jobs. With the morals and mindsets that the men had acquired growing up, they faced difficulty keeping their jobs as they valued the respect of their employees more than the importance of getting the job done. The men are extremely affected by their adolescent years and are now struggling to provide for children of their own. This cycle seems to continue as the elders always stress the importance of a quality education; the only challenge is learning how to get it. Chapter 4 - Framing Social Reality: Stratification and Inequality Chapter 4 focuses on determining what the men's interpretive thoughts are on characteristics of society such as power, hierarchy, and social relations across race and class lines. The author mainly focuses on each of the men's personal experiences. By analyzing their differences in opinions, the author strives to figure out how differences in personal experiences connect to the kinds of interpretations that the men have. Barry received his high school diploma but fell into the unfortunate act of drug dealing soon after graduating. He talks about how much he regrets doing it, but he needed the money then, and that was the easiest way to get it. When asked if he believed that discrimination existed, he was the only one that did not believe that it was present. He believed that you are discriminated against only if you allow yourself to be. In other words, he was saying that you determine your own fate. Barry believed that he could have done something far better with his life had he only refused to take no for an answer and been more determined. Despite Barry's position, he had so little to say about the existence of discrimination obstacles and barriers towards upward mobility. Donald, another man who was interviewed, had a completely different outlook on these questions. Donald grew up working small jobs at a variety of businesses and although he was not a part of the wealthier society, he viewed it from his position. He stated that he witnessed racism and discrimination all the time, and he believes that was why he was fired from some of his jobs. He believes that as long as there are different wealth classes these unfortunate aspects of society are always going to remain. Chapter 5 - Framing Individual Mobility and Attainment Chapter 5 addresses the recurring thoughts about how low-income African-American men make sense of mobility and attainment in American society. Its main focus is to help determining what we can do to enhance these men's thoughts on advancement in society. Through the information acquired during the interviews, it seems as though the men's ability to imagine aspects of life that are present further out in society such as mobility barriers and discrimination are often limited by what they have experienced in Near West Side. The men were asked about their thoughts of mobility and attainment in the country, and they were mostly split into two categories. Those who knew little about it and did not have much to say, and those who had passionate responses towards why they believed there were barriers and discrimination in society. Half of the men had not been fortunate enough to have a job because of their lack of motivation or qualifications. These men who had always been unemployed were least likely to speak of the role that outside forces play in shaping a person's chances in life. On the other hand, the men that were a part of some sort of employment had completely different thoughts on mobility and attainment. Often, the men with more work experience had experienced social conflicts themselves and were able to talk thoroughly about their beliefs on how the role of external factors affect an individual's chances in life. Chapter 6 - Looking Up from Below: Framing Personal Reality Chapter 6 focuses on self-identification: discovering and stating who you are as a person; understanding what you want your mission in life and goals to be; and how to mobilize oneself in society in order to achieve these goals. Different aspects of the stereotypical ideal future or \\"good life\\" are mentioned. This ideal future mentioned touches on the three spheres of life: work, home, and individual well-being. In this stage of self-identification, a specific profession is not addressed; instead the goal is to attain whatever fits the individual's definition of a well- paying job. There is a strong emphasis on personal mobility and opportunity as the basis for aspirations or the 'ideal\\" future. The author touches on the essential points of using any resources that are possible in order to mobilize yourself on a small scale, and to in time give yourself and opportunity on a larger scale. An example given is of Arthur working at a liquor store to get an idea of how to set up his own business. The author analyzes the men's lack of social capital in the world of work, and says the men are disadvantaged in the human capital of strategic skills and talents. The world of work is shown as a world of education, brainpower, skill, and credentials, which are resources for success in the working world. The attributes of strength and physical stamina have very little importance in the white-collar environment. The author notes that the men's perceptions of their own skills would limit them to minimally skilled positions. Chapter 7 - Getting There: Navigating Personal Mobility Chapter 7 focuses on aspects of personal mobility, personal impediments to getting ahead, and the special place of race in class. Chapter seven briefly touches on and concludes the men's discussion on the modern-day America and the American Dream. They touch on the emphasizing factors of discipline, hard work, education, and motivation. The men believe that a high school diploma is a bare essential towards minimal success in the working world, but that the only useful education was direct training to one's career interests. The men then move on to confronting and acknowledging their own self-induced barriers. Men like Gus and Casey talk about their struggles with substance abuse, and the problems that it caused for them regarding motivation and finding work. The men who had been previously incarcerated such as Devin, Earl, Lester, and Casey, talk about the difficulty of finding work with a criminal record. The men then discuss the difficulty of personal mobility. They discuss how being African-American puts them in a lower class, with fewer resources and opportunities, thus making it harder for them to mobilize and to make something of themselves. Chapter 8 - Recasting the Crisis of Poor Black Men Chapter 8 starts off with some funny yet interesting words from a man by the name of Vance Smith. Smith said: \\"That's retarded to think that [black men do not know how to take control of their lives]. People actually think like that? I mean, people with Ph.D's and shit.\\" People who think that black men cannot be responsible for their lives are extremely wrong. This book has shown us that these poor black men have plans to improve themselves and have hopes and dreams they just lack the skills and capital to better themselves. They are many things that need to be done before these people can live better lives. A key one would be a stable labor market with good job training. But the likelihood of that happening is small because the majority of people view this community with the idea of \\"three strikes and you're out.\\" That these people had their chance and chose to cheat and therefore put themselves in the situation that they are in and we should not have to help them. The last main point in the book is that as times change and their situation changes the way researchers and people view that area needs to change with it otherwise they will never be able to get out of the hole that they are in.

It was the dharmasastra used in this medieval era kingdom. ' is a part of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras, an Indian literary tradition that serves as a collection of legal maxims relating to the topic of dharma. This text is purely juridical in character in that it focuses solely on procedural and substantive law. Known as the \\"juridical text par excellence,\\" the is the only Dharma≈õƒÅstra text to not cover areas such as righteous conduct and penance.Lariviere 1989: ix Its focused nature has made the text highly valued by rulers and their governments, in Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, likely as an aid of carrying out their dharma of justly ruling the country. Recensions Today there exist three recognized versions of Naradasmriti, also called Naradiya Dharmasastra.Max Muller (1907), Introduction to Narada The Sacred Books of the East, Vol 33, London First, there is the ‚Äúminor‚Äù recension, consisting of 879 verses and referred to by the siglum D. Next comes the recension known by the siglum P and consisting originally of 550 verses. Jolly later edited the text to contain verses from the ‚Äúminor‚Äù recension as well, bringing the total to 1028 verses. The third version comes from the NewƒÅrƒ´ manuscripts and the and goes by the siglum NMS, containing 870 verses. Each recension is unique not only in length, but content as well. For example, in P, an entire chapter is found of which no other manuscript makes mention.Lariviere 1989: xiv One of the most thoroughly studied differences is that of the variation in naming of Ordeals. The NMS, seen as the oldest of the three texts, lists only two ordeals in the standard chapter on ‚ÄúNonpayment of Debt‚Äù but contains an addendum which lists five more ordeals. The Vulgate also lists five ordeals but manuscript P adds two more, bringing the total to seven.Lariviere 1989: xvi Source and Authority One recension claims that ‚ÄúManu PrajƒÅpati originally composed a text in 100,000 verses and 1080 chapters, which was successively abridged by the sages NƒÅrada, MƒÅrkandeya, and Sumati BhƒÅrgava, down to a text of 4,000 verses.‚Äù Lariviere 1989: xxiii , according to this recension's claim, represent the ninth chapter, regarding legal procedure, of Manu‚Äôs original text. This connection may enhance the prestige of because some traditional texts state Manu pronouncements on dharma is above challenge. However, Lariviere notes that it is clear from the critical edition and examination of other ancient documents that this explanation of NƒÅradasm·πõti's origin is a myth, and was added later.\\"Lariviere 2003: page 14, see note 61 and Kane's analysis of Medhathiti ()\\" Naradasmriti was an authoritative document not only in Indian subcontinent, as well as when Hinduism flourished in southeast Asia. A 12th-century inscription in Champa empire of Jaya Harivarman, in what is now modern Vietnam, declares that its court officials were \\"expert in all dharmasastras, especially Naradiya and Bhargaviya\\".George Coed√®s, The Indianized States of Southeast Asia, , University of Hawaii Press, page 164-166Lariviere 2003: page 14 The divine sage NƒÅrada is known as the messenger of the gods, transmitting divine will to the people of the earth. Although not known for being an expert in dharma, he has been portrayed as an instructor of law and politics. Author Lariviere argues that there was ‚Äúno single ‚Äòauthor‚Äô of this text\\" but rather, either an individual or a group who compiled all of the verses attributed by a particular community to the sage NƒÅrada. Examination of the scripts of the original manuscript determines that the manuscripts were written in the South of India while the NewƒÅrƒ´ manuscript came from Nepal. The recensions D and P appear to have been found throughout the subcontinent but rarely in Nepal or Kerala.Lariviere 1989: xv‚Äìxvi Date Similar to all ancient Indian texts, specific dates for the authoring of the continue to elude scholars. Varying arguments have been made and evidences cited but no decisive conclusions have been made. The best timeframe which can be provided is somewhere between 100BCE and 400CE.See Lariviere 1989: xix‚Äìxxiii or Olivelle ‚ÄúLiterary History‚Äù: 24 for more information on the details of this debate. In 1876 manuscript D of the was translated by the German scholar, Julius Jolly, making it available to legal scholars in Europe for the first time. The work was readily accepted in Europe due to its style, content, and structure which was similar enough to Roman legal texts of the time that the scholars felt comfortable dealing with it. Karl Marx even used this translation as a reference for his Asiatic Modes of Production.Lariviere 1989: xi In 1879, Jolly translated manuscript P. In 1989, Lariviere revisited the text and produced a critical translation which includes evidence from the NWS manuscripts, as well as D and P, which Jolly used. Structure The structure of the is based on the eighteen titles of law, which are also mentioned in the Manusm·πõti but with some variation in names.Lariviere 1989: xvii The text begins with a brief introduction into law and the courts before delving into these 18 titles, devoting a chapter to each. The way in which this text is written makes it clear that the author(s) was appealing to a community of practitioners, interested in directly applying the law to every day cases.Lariviere 1989: x =Matrka (Prolegomena)= #Vyavaharah #Bhasa #Sabha =VyavahƒÅrapada (18 Titles of Law)= # #Nik≈üepa #Sambh≈´yasamutthƒÅna #DattƒÅpradƒÅnika # #VetanasyƒÅnapƒÅkarma #AsvƒÅmivikraya # #Krƒ´tƒÅnu≈õaya #SamayasyƒÅnapƒÅkarma # # #DƒÅyabhƒÅga #SƒÅhasa # # #Dy≈´tasamƒÅhvaya # Notes References * *Olivelle, Patrick. \\"Dharmasastra: A Literary History\\" * External links * Naradasmriti, English Translation * Naradasmriti, One of the three known distinct versions of the Law Book (in Sanskrit) * NƒÅradasm·πõti: IAST-Translit, A SARIT Initiative, The British Association for South Asian Studies and The British Academy Hindu law Ancient Indian literature Dharma ≈öƒÅstra ","title":"NƒÅradasm·πõti"},{"id":"20600910","text":"Jean-Pierre Emile Boeres (1890‚Äì1944) was a Luxembourg composer, organist and choir master.

The event was held annually in October in the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The ADFF aimed to showcase the best films from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers. Since 2012, the festival had been part of the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority, specifically under Media Zone Events and powered by its partner company, twofour54. It was officially scrapped after eight versions in 2015. Inaugural festival The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. The festival started in 2007 with the support of H.E. Mohammed Khalaf AL Mazroui as General Director of the ADACH, and Nashwa Al Ruwaini as Executive Director. In 2008, Imad DeirAtany, a talented Lebanese filmmaker and marketer joined the team with more than 200 staff members that empowered the festival's brand. Re-branding In 2010, ADACH has developed the Festival's brand, allowing it to showcase more effectively with Dubai Film Festival, Doha Tribeca Film Festival, Cannes, etc. With the changes came the move from MEIFF to Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Headlining features With a new branding scheme, the 2010 ADFF is making a strong effort to break out from a cluttered festival junket in the Persian Gulf region. This year there are six feature films and two documentaries that are attracting a considerable amount of industry buzz. In a Better World by the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier, takes a look at the lives of two families in small-town Denmark as they become intertwined through an uneasy friendship of two boys. The official Canadian entry to the Oscar also bows in Abu Dhabi. Incendies, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is based on a play by Canadian-Lebanese writer Wajdi Mouawad, and tells the story of a mother‚Äôs cryptic will that forces her grown children to confront the prospect that the father they thought dead is alive, and that they have a brother. From Egypt is Messages from the Sea by Daoud Abdel Sayed, which follows the story of Yehya, who returns to Alexandria, the city of his youth following the death of his mother, where he encounters the new face of the ancient, portrayed as a decaying metropolis. Cirkus Columbia, is also considered an Oscar contender. Directed by Danis Tanovic, who won the Best Foreign Language Oscar with his film No Man‚Äôs Land in 2002. Cirkus Columbia follows a wealthy ex-pat who comes home to his small village in Yugoslavia in 1991. Two documentary films, both dealing with current tensions in the Middle East, are highlighting the 2010 Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace, directed by American director Harry Hunkele and produced by American Emmy-award winning producer Arick Wierson, tells the story of the secret closed door negotiations and power-plays that enabled U.S. President Jimmy Carter to forge the historic Camp David Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt. The film stars Jimmy Carter, former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, CNN anchorman Wolf Blitzer, and, in a rare on camera appearance, former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. The Oath is documentary from director Laura Poitras that tells the tale of two men, Abu Jandal and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, whose meeting launched them on juxtaposed paths with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, 9/11, US military tribunals and the U.S. Supreme Court. There are two major Hollywood features opening at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Making its world premier is Secretariat, directed by Randall Wallace, starring Diane Lane and John Malkovich is an adopted biopic of the eponymous racehorse Secretariat. Making its Middle East premiere is Fair Game, starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn and directed by Doug Liman, the political thriller tells the real-life story of Valerie Plame, American CIA agent outed by the Bush Administration in an effort to discredit revelations of falsified evidence in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Celebrity involvement The Abu Dhabi Film Festival is known for attracting a bevy of big Hollywood names, including noteworthy director Michael Greenspan (best known for his feature film Wrecked, which debuted there in 2009), as well as actors such as Uma Thurman and Adrien Brody attended in 2010.http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/events/thurman-brody-to-attend- abu-dhabi-film-fest-2010-09-28-1.296294 Press In October, 2009, the UK Guardian published an article about the origins and intent of the MEIFF. The article noted that although the host country, Abu Dhabi, at present has only a small indigenous film-making industry, the film festival could serve a variety of constructive purposes.\\"Just Add Cash - Abu Dhabi's Instant Cinema\\", UK Guardian, 27 Oct 2009 , accessed 27 Oct 2009.

(2008)Eric Michelman, a graduate from MIT, is credited with inventing the now commonplace computer input device known as the scroll wheel. Scroll wheels are most often located between the left and right-click buttons on modern computer mice.  History  In 1993, Michelman began work on his project to ease navigation within Excel. His interest in eased navigability stemmed from real-time observation of users entering data in spreadsheets. > ‚Äú‚Ä¶as I was watching many Excel users do their work, I noticed the difficulty > they had moving around large spreadsheets. Finding and jumping to different > sections was often difficult. I had the idea that perhaps a richer input > device would help.‚Äù Michelman initially looked to add a 'zoom-lever' for the left hand to control while navigating the Microsoft GUI. After experimenting with a joystick assigned to panning (scrolling) as well as zooming, Michelman approached Microsoft's engineers with his idea. In his position as Program Management Lead for the Excel project, he persuaded the hardware engineers to develop added functionality to the current hardware to allow richer input and then evangelized the new functionality to the other Office applications. A debate raged over whether all the Office applications should have the same scrolling or zooming default, with Michelman subsequently conceding to the idea that having them all, including Excel, scroll by default would possess the greatest overall utility. Michelman was charged with organizing the software support for this new function. Being the Program Management Lead for the Excel project, he was well positioned to achieve this, and did.  Advances in Technology  There have been many advances in computing mice since the dawn of the scroll wheel. 1999 brought the advent of a marketable LED technology optical mouse from Agilent. Close following in the same year, Microsoft released its version of an optical mouse, the Intellimouse Explorer. Michelman's brainchild has since been elaborated on by the likes of Logitech, Apple, and other major computer peripheral manufacturers. In 2007 Logitech combined all of these technologies and more when the company released a 7-button, 2-wheel, fully customizable mousing device aptly named \\"MX Revolution.\\" This technology is intended to address a user's need when > \\"The typical computer user has six applications open and switches windows > every 50 seconds. In a work day, we rack up 26 feet on the mouse's scroll > wheel.\\"  Other Contributors  A jointly developed mouse by Japanese (NTT) and Swiss (ETH) companies may mark the first appearance of a wheel-function on a mouse back in 1985. They developed what was a thumb wheel for their companies, the (original) \\"Mighty Mouse.\\" This mouse did not catch any traction in the world computing market.  Additional work by Michelman  Michelman has an SB degree from MIT, an MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and an MBA from MIT. Before working at Microsoft, he worked at Apple on the Lisa project and co-founded Analytica with Adam Bosworth, hiring Brad Silverberg as their first employee. Michelman has also been prolific in participating in the production of patents pertaining to different ergonomic and navigability properties of computer input implements.

Biography Leavitt, a resident of Malden, Massachusetts,By 1885 Boston city directories show that Thomas Leavitt had moved to South Boston. was born in 1827 at Hingham, Massachusetts, the son of Martin Lincoln Leavitt,Thomas and Martin Leavitt were sons of Martin Lincoln Leavitt of Hingham and his wife Tirzah Pratt (Thomas), who was born at Weymouth, Massachusetts. Martin Leavitt died on April 2, 1877 in Melrose, Massachusetts. and began working in the early 1870s on a continuous cancelling machine - one that could mechanically sort and stamp envelopes. The postage stamp itself was a relatively new invention, introduced in the U.S. in 1847, and within a couple of decades the volume of U.S. mail began overwhelming hand cancelling, the only practical method of cancelling each stamp so it could not be reused. By the early 1870s, inventors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had introduced a machine which allowed the cancelling of postal cards of a standardized size, speeding their processing by eliminating the need for hand-cancelling. But a mechanism which would allow letters of various sizes, shapes and thicknesses to pass through a sorter proved a stumbling block. In 1875 Thomas Leavitt and his brother Martin were issued United States Patent Number 175,290 for a device which would allow different sizes of letters to have their postage stamps cancelled.There are indications that Thomas Leavitt had received earlier patents, perhaps for other inventions unrelated to postal cancelling. The two brothers tested their hand-cranked, hand-fed device at the main Boston Post Office under the watchful eye of postal workers. The device was largely a failure. But after more tinkering, Leavitt and his brother got a second patent (Number 192,519). The Leavitt brothers' second device is considered the first practical device in the U.S. for mechanized cancelling.Leavitt Patent Models, Smithsonian National Postal Museum Backing Leavitt financially was Henry E. Waite, who advanced Leavitt money for construction of the initial model. Following the death of Martin Leavitt in 1877,Thomas Leavitt's brother Martin was likely living in Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1859. The same Martin Leavitt was likely to have been married at Medford, Massachusetts, not far from Malden, in 1834. Thomas Leavitt continued to work on the brothers' initial invention, eventually enlisting his cousin Elijah Leavitt Howard Elijah Leavitt Howard was likely the Elijah Leavitt Howard living at nearby Hingham, Massachusetts with his wife in 1871. Perhaps Howard moved to Malden that year to be closer to Thomas Leavitt's machine shop, because an 1871 assignment of a U.S. Patent for an edging guide to sewing machines shows Elijah Leavitt Howard then at Malden. to help in his machine shop and perfect the device. Leavitt eventually received five patents for his mechanical sorting devices. Most of Leavitt's subsequent improvements were designed to improve the feeder mechanism for sorting envelopes of various sizes and shapes, as well as pulling each envelope through the rollers for cancelling. In awarding Leavitt's new machine a gold medal at its 1881 exhibition, the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association noted that Leavitt's subsequent improvements on his original patent had perfected the earlier postal card cancelling machine, \\"allowing letters of large or small size, either thick or thin, to be operated on to perfection.\\" A number of improvements, including a feeder box, a system of double rollers and a movable impression shaft meant that Leavitt's new invention could be used for all manners of letters, instead of for just a standard-sized card. \\"The machine works to perfection,\\" the judges noted, \\"and saves a great deal of labor.\\"Fourteenth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, September and October 1881, Boston, Mass. The Leavitt machines, first produced in 1875, saw wide usage in Boston, and subsequently in New York through the end of the 1870s, the 1880s and the 1890s. During the decades following introduction of the revolutionary machine, Leavitt refined the design, garnering new patents and introducing new models. By 1880 Leavitt machines were used in 20 American cities. The cancellations produced by Leavitt machines bore distinctive signatures - sometimes horizontal or diagonal lines, or even football shapes. By 1882, Leavitt's cousin Elijah Leavitt Howard, formerly a machinist in Leavitt's shop, had made a series of modifications to Leavitt's original design, work which was also financed by Henry Waite. Leavitt's initial models \\"had serious defects which rendered its use impracticable\\", noted a later U.S. Patent Court decision of 1901.Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents and of the United States Courts in Patent and Trade-mark Cases, 1901, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1902 Following Howard's work, the machine was taken to a Boston post office in 1883, where it was used to sort letters for several hours each day, apparently successfully. Howard's improvements on Leavitt's initial machine - including triggers which prevented the deposit of ink on the machine's pressure roll when no envelope was engaged - worked successfully. But Howard's model was shelved and never introduced commercially. Gravestone of Elijah Leavitt Howard, Hingham, Massachusetts. Howard helped his cousin Thomas Leavitt in designing machines to machine-cancel mail Following the tests, Howard tinkered with his version of Leavitt's cancelling machine to make it quieter and easier to use. But Howard's machine was eventually shelved after its testing. Later, when a competing inventor came up with a modified machine (after having studied prints of Howard's model), the U.S. Patent Courts held the machine did not infringe on Leavitt's initial patent. Because Howard had never introduced his variation, the new model was simply a 'failed experiment'. The field was opening to a slew of new developers. The next decade brought new competitors to the postal cancelling machine business, with the American Postal Machine Company introducing a line of devices in the 1890s noted for their speed. Soon there were scores of competitors hungry for business from the exploding volumes of United States mail. Thomas Leavitt, who set off the stampede with his first design, was married to Martha Elizabeth Whittier of Cornville, Maine, in 1851. The inventor died in 1899 and his wife Martha died in 1910. The couple had four children. See also * Machine postmark * United States Postal Service References Further reading * Thomas Leavitt: His History and Postal Markings, 1875-1892, Robert J.

Willow River Power Co., 324 U.S. 499 (1945), is a 1945 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the question whether the United States was liable under the Fifth Amendment for a ‚Äútaking‚Äù of private property for a public purpose when it built a dam on navigable waters that raised the water level upstream to lessen the head of water at a power company‚Äôs dam, thereby decreasing the production of power by the company‚Äôs hydroelectric turbines. The Court‚Äôs opinion is notable because it considers whether the courts will provide a remedy because a property right has been invaded, or whether a property right exists because the courts will enforce it.The initial use of this question in property law analysis has been attributed to Professor Myres S. McDougal of the Yale Law School. See Richard H. Stern, Scope-of- Protection Problems With Patents and Copyrights on Methods of Doing Business, 10 L.J. 105, 128 n.100 (1999) (referring to \\"Professor Myres McDougal‚Äôs famous question, 'Do we protect it because it‚Äôs a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?'‚Äù). The question is analogous to the dilemma found in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro.In Euthyphro Socrates asks Euthyphro: \\"Is the pious (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ΩÖœÉŒπŒøŒΩ) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is that which the gods love (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÜŒπŒªŒ≠œÇ)?\\" Factual background right The Mississippi River, a navigable stream, is joined by the St. Croix River, another navigable stream, slightly above Red Wing, Minnesota. Farther up the St. Croix, the Willow River, a non-navigable stream, flowed into the St. Croix, but some years ago a dam was built blocking off the former mouth of the Willow. A channel was dug above that dam, connecting the Willow to the St. Croix, and the channel was also dammed. A mill was built to exploit the head of water created by the two dams. Subsequently, the Willow River Power Company acquired the land adjacent to these dams and it built a hydroelectric facility near them. The spillway or tailrace below the power‚Äôs company‚Äôs turbines exited into the St. Croix River. (See map.) The United States then built the Red Wing Dam on the Mississippi River. The dam raised the water level of the Mississippi above Red Wing and also that of the St. Croix. The effect was to decrease the available head of water at the hydroelectric plant by three feet, decreasing the power output from the turbines and requiring the power company to purchase electric power from other sources. The economic loss to the power company was $25,000. The power company sued the United States for a taking and was awarded $25,000. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.. Decision of Supreme Court =Majority opinion= The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Jackson, reversed. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires just compensation when private property is taken for public use. It thus ‚Äúundertakes to redistribute certain economic losses inflicted by public improvements so that they will fall upon the public, rather than wholly upon those who happen to lie in the path of the project.‚Äù The Fifth Amendment does not, however, ‚Äúsocialize all losses, but those only which result from a taking of property.‚Äù Other damages that result from government conduct are absorbed by the public, if at all, only when Congress passes a law providing for compensation. In this case, no such law exists, so that unless this case represents an instance of a ‚Äútaking‚Äù of ‚Äúproperty,‚Äù the power company is without redress for its $25,000 loss.324 U.S. at 502. The Court then stated the issue before it, in terms similar to those of the Euthyphro dilemma: > [N]ot all economic interests are \\"property rights;\\" only those economic > advantages are \\"rights\\" which have the law back of them, and only when they > are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with > them or to compensate for their invasion. The law long has recognized that > the right of ownership in land may carry with it a legal right to enjoy some > benefits from adjacent waters. But that a closed catalogue of abstract and > absolute \\"property rights\\" in water hovers over a given piece of shore land > good against all the world is not, in this day, a permissible assumption. We > cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here > a \\"property right;\\" whether it is a property right is really the question to > be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally > protected interests.324 U.S. at 503. After considering precedents governing rights to a head of water when the tailrace was in a navigable stream or a non-navigable stream, the Court concluded that no prior case had dealt with precisely the situation (present here) where the top of the tailrace was at a non-navigable stream and its base was at a navigable stream. Accordingly, there was no recognized legal right to have water flow away from a tailrace into a navigable stream. The Court therefore ruled: > We hold that claimant's interest or advantage in the high water level of the > St. Croix River as a run-off for tail waters to maintain its power head is > not a right protected by law, and that the award below based exclusively on > the loss in value thereof must be reversed.324 U.S. at 511. =Dissent= Justice Roberts (joined by the Chief Justice) dissented on the ground that state law recognized a property interest in having a head of water undisturbed. =Comparison of majority and dissenting opinions= It appears that the Court (majority) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. The dissenters, however, considered that property rights existed a priori and dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

Prapiroon developed out of a persistent area of convection accompanied by an area of low pressure on July 25 about 120 km (75 mi) west-southwest of Yap. Two days later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, with PAGASA giving it the local name 'Henry'. By July 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. A strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the depression led to a west-northwest movement for most of the storm existence. A few hours after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the depression made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August 2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00 UTC on August 3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August 5\\\\. Severe flooding in the Philippines and China from Prapiroon killed 94 people and left 10 others missing. Over 20 million people were affected by the storm in China alone. Significant flight delays and cancellations in Hong Kong led to $1.9 million in compensation pay to travelers. About 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged by the storm. Damages were estimated at $640,000 (2006 USD) in the Philippines and $984 million (2006 USD) in China. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought $4,825,791 (2006 USD) in funds for victims of the typhoon. Meteorological history On July 25, an area of convection persisted about 120 km (75 mi) west-southwest of Yap. Satellite imagery indicated that a low level circulation had developed and was under an area of light to moderate wind shear. The low traveled in a general northwest fashion as upper level outflow improved. By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized. However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity near the center of the low increased, and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression early that morning. Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry. As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south. At 02:30 UTC on June 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 00:00 UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest due to a strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July 31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300 km (185 mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west- northwest at 24 km/h (15 mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August 2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a few hours later, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon. Heading towards the northwest, Prapiroon reached its peak intensity early on August 3\\\\. The JMA estimated that Prapiroon peaked with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg), while the JTWC estimated that the storm peaked with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph 1-minute winds). Prapiroon maintained this intensity for 12 hours before weakening slightly as it made landfall near Shangyang at 12:00 UTC. At the time of landfall, the JMA downgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC analyzed Prapiroon to have had winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds). Due to the interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened. Early on August 5, both agencies issued their final advisories on Prapiroon as it dissipated over central Guangxi. Preparations Typhoon Prapiroon upon landfall on August 3 =Philippines= As Tropical Depression 07W, locally named 'Henry' by PAGASA, neared the provence the northern Philippines, a total of 17 provinces were placed under a storm alert as winds of 30 kts (55 km/h) were likely to affect areas near the depression. Residents in the northern Philippines were advised to avoid low- lying areas and be alert for flooding. About 15,000 people were evacuated following heavy rains from the outer bands of the storm. =China= In advance of Prapiroon, government officials in Guangdong Provence, China sent out 11 million mobile text messages to alert people of the approaching storm. About 843,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, 335,000 in Guangdong, 382,000 in Guangxi, and 126,000 in Hainan. Officials ordered 62,023 ships to return to port to prevent them from being stranded at sea. = Hong Kong and Macau = The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted strong wind signal 1 on August 1 as the system was located within 800 km (497 mi) of their respective cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to strong wind signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased to strong wind signal 8 SE on August 3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland. Kindergarten and special schools in Hong Kong were suspended for at least two days for the day of and following the storms landfall. Impact In the wake of Prapiroon, severe flooding left 94 people dead and 10 others missing. Damages from the storm were estimated at $984.8 million (2006 USD; $1.1 billion 2008 USD). Throughout southern China, Prapiroon affected over 20 million people. =Philippines= Tropical Depression 07W 'Henry' making landfall in the Philippines on July 31 As a tropical depression, Prapiroon caused heavy rains over the northern Philippines, leaving six people dead. In Candaba, a two- year-old boy, identified as Elmer Celso, drowned in floodwaters outside his home. Five other fatalities were reported due to flooding. Two other people were listed as missing. Agricultural damage was estimated at $640,000 (2006 USD). =China= Trees uprooted by Prapiroon in Zhongshan City Despite weakening to a severe tropical storm before landfall, Prapiroon brought torrential rains and flooding which left 88 people dead and eight others missing. About 10 million people were affected by the typhoon, while 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged. Damages from the typhoon were estimated at $984 million (2006 USD; $1.1 billion 2008 USD). Guangdong Province was the hardest hit of the three provinces affected by Typhoon Prapiroon. About 3.72 million people were affected by the storm and 7,000 homes were destroyed in the province. A tornado struck Foshan, Shanwei and Shaoguan, killing nine. A police officer was killed when a landslide buried him during a rescue in Sihui. Another hard hit province, Guangxi, was struck by Prapiroon. About 5.1 million people were affected by the storm and 219,441 were displaced. Ten people were killed by a flash flood and landslide in Laibin and Hengxian. Another flash flood swept away a shelter which thirteen migrant workers resided in, all of whom were confirmed to have been killed. Three more people were killed when a landslide caused their home to collapse in Luming Village. About 9,300 homes and 195,900 hectares of farmland were destroyed. =Hong Kong= As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, thousands of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights in and out of the area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10 million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9 million (2006 USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103 km/h (63 mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193 km/h (119 mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbour. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1 in (207.5 mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71 m (8.89 ft) was recorded. The Typhoon signal number 8 should have been hoisted as gales were recorded in most areas of the territory. As a result, the Hong Kong Observatory had to deal with a lot of criticism. Aftermath After Prapiroon dissipated, the regional Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the damage in the wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006 USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span.

It is a platform game (then called climbing games by the US press). The game was given the KidStuff logo on the cover art; meaning it was aimed at gamers under the age of nine. Bootleg versions of the game were sold around the world under three different names: Apples and Dolls by CCE, Teddy Apple by Home Vision, and Ursinho Esperto always by CCE (but only in Brazil).http://atariage.com/forums/topic/258068-open-sesame-vs-apples-and- dolls-vs-i-want-my-mommy/ A clone version was instead released in Asia as Open, Sesame!, which was developed by Puzzy. Gameplay The player controls Teddy, and must guide him up a six-story structure to the goal at the top. The goal of the first stage is to collect the Apple at the top, and the goal of the second is to get to the mommy at the top. After completing the two stages, the game returns to the first stage but at a higher difficulty. Attempting to stop Teddy from reaching the top are monsters that patrol the floors of the structure. Since Teddy can't jump, he has to use teleportation beams to connect upward on the playing field. Monsters can be faked out by partially going up a teleporter then coming back down again.

Armoured reconnaissance is the combination of terrestrial reconnaissance with armoured warfare by soldiers using tanks and wheeled or tracked armoured reconnaissance vehicles. While the mission of reconnaissance is to gather intelligence about the enemy with the use of reconnaissance vehicles, armoured reconnaissance adds the ability to fight for information, and to have an effect on and to shape the enemy through the performance of traditional armoured tasks. Armoured reconnaissance units =Australia= In the Australian Army the main reconnaissance vehicle is the ASLAV armoured scout car, which is the Australian version of the LAV 25. The Army Reserve regiments use the Light Cavalry Patrol Vehicle, aka the Regional Force Surveillance Vehicle, which is a variant of the Land Rover Perentie.

There has not been a divisional armoured reconnaissance regiment in Canada since 1992. While there are no armoured reconnaissance regiments in the Regular Force in the present day, each Regular Force armoured regiment does provide a formation armoured reconnaissance squadron equipped with armoured cars to each mechanised brigade. Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) is a tank-heavy regiment with two squadrons of tanks and one squadron of armoured cars, while both the Royal Canadian Dragoons and the 12e R√©giment blind√© du Canada are armoured car-heavy regiments, with three armoured car squadrons each and one shared tank squadron. Although the Reserve Force regiments continue to be known as armoured reconnaissance regiments, since the loss of the medium tank from their organisation, they have in reality only been employed in the light reconnaissance (scout) role.

It was formed at the country's independence in 1957 and consists of two squadrons. The regiment has served with distinction in various African peacekeeping missions, and is partly equipped with EE-9 Cascavel and Ratel-90 armoured cars. #1st Ghanaian Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment =Kenya= The Kenyan Army has a single armoured reconnaissance battalion, equipped mainly with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars. #76 ARB (armoured reconnaissance battalion) =Netherlands= The Dutch Army has one regiment, the Regiment Huzaren van Boreel which was named after Willem Francois Boreel. The Regiment consists of 4 squadrons: 2 squadrons belong to the ISTAR battalion and the other 2 each belonging to 1 of the 2 Netherlands Mechanised Brigades. The difference in organisation between the ISTAR squadrons and the brigade squadrons is that the ISTAR squadrons each have a Tactical Air Control Party for Close Air Support and the 2 brigade squadrons each have an FST section. All squadrons are trained to operate completely independently. They have their own logistical support and all patrols have communication specialists and special forces medics for emergencies. The training and operation procedures of all squadrons are very similar although the ISTAR squadrons focus more on missions not from brigade but from national command. All squadrons have been on combat operations in the south of Afghanistan. =New Zealand= The New Zealand Army only has one squadron that performs armoured reconnaissance. This is also the only reserve armoured squadron. #Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles #4th Waikato Mounted Rifles part of 6th Hauraki Battalion Group =Norway= The Norwegian Army has two armoured reconnaissance squadrons. #Tropp 2/ Pansret Oppklarning part of the Cavalry Squadron in the Telemark Battalion #Tropp 2/ Pansert Oppklarning part of the Cavalry Squadron in the Panser Battalion =Sri Lanka= The Sri Lanka Army has five recce regiments attached to the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps. *1st Reconnaissance Regiment SLAC *3rd Reconnaissance Regiment SLAC *5th Reconnaissance Regiment SLAC *6th Reconnaissance Regiment SLAC *8th Reconnaissance Regiment SLAC =South Africa= Eland-90 armoured reconnaissance vehicle. There is only one dedicated armoured reconnaissance regiment in the South African Army, the Light Horse Regiment, and it is considered an armoured car unit. The regiment, which has its roots in the British South African Light Horse, was initially equipped with Ferret scout cars. Following the aggressive nature of South African reconnaissance doctrine, the lightly armed Ferret was replaced first by the Eland Mk7 and after 1991 the Rooikat, which were heavier vehicles equipped with large- calibre cannon. # Light Horse Regiment =United Kingdom= In the British Army armoured reconnaissance units carry out \\"formation reconnaissance\\"Reconnaissance army.mod.uk for higher level formations. In the British Army these Formation reconnaissance regiments are usually providing reconnaissance for a division or a heavy brigade.

It was located on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.  History  Philpstoun station was opened by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on 21 February 1842. It was closed on 18 June 1951 by British Railways. The area around Philpstoun, in common with others in West Lothian, was an extremely busy centre for shale mining and petroleum manufacturing for almost a century, and this was reflected in the railways around Philpstoun. The station itself was situated in a deep cutting, and had two platforms. Immediately to the west, a facing junction, with crossovers and a looping facilities connected to a set of exchange sidings at Westfield, and these ran into Philpstoun No 1 shale mine. Extensive sidings connected within the facility, and a short branch ran just west of the (still extant) shale bings, crossing the canal, and continuing past Easter Pardovan in a southerly direction to serve a shale pit at Ochiltree (just north west of Threemiletown). A tramway ran in the same direction on the eastern flank of the bings. A trailing siding left the main up line near Pardovan, this was known as Pardovan siding and originally served a quarry. Further west, a line branched from the down main via a trailing junction and ran adjacent to the mainline for some 500 yards before swinging south west, passing Champfleurie, before swinging south to serve oil works and a shale mine between Bridgend and Wester Ochiltree.

Built during the Napoleonic wars in 1812-16, and situated on Finavarra Point, the tower protected the north-eastern side of Ballyvaughan Bay and the south- western entrance of New Quay harbour from possible attack from France. British military engineers built many such fortifications as signal towers to protect the coast against a French invasion. Most of these towers are oval or round and stand between forty and sixty feet high. Their staircases were incorporated within the walls and the doorway was usually some distance above ground level. This ovoid tower had three gun placements on the roof. The usual garrison of these towers was about ten men who would have lived in a nearby barracks. The remains of such a barracks lie north-east of the tower. However, nearby Aughinish Tower which is thought to have been of similar and contemporaneous construction, included quarters for around 40 men.

Specializing in violin and piano, she studied at the Luxembourg Conservatory until 1906, then taught there from 1908. While still young, she began to compose. Her first success was her one-act operetta An der Schemm (At the Baths), composed in 1922. From 1933, many of her orchestral works, especially her waltzes and marches, were played for radio by the RTL Grand Symphony Orchestra. Her greatest success was however the choral ballad Der Geiger von Echternach (The Echternach Fiddler) which she completed when she was 85. It was premiered in the Abbey of Echternach in July 1972 to great acclaim. Early life and education Born on 7 May 1889 in Luxembourg City, Louise Koster was the daughter of the railway official Jean Koster (1852‚Äì1919) and Emma Hoebich (1865‚Äì1950). Her maternal grandfather, Franz Ferdinand Bernhard Hoebich (1813‚Äì1900), who was born in Silisia, was the conductor of the military band in Echternach from 1842. He later directed the music corps at the grand-ducal court. After retiring in 1878 and becoming a widower in 1882, Hoebich became the music teacher of Lou and her sister Lina (1891‚Äì1938). Lou had two other siblings, Fernand (1902‚Äì1981) and Laure (1902‚Äì1999). It was her grandfather who taught Lou Koster not only to play both the violin and the piano but also elementary music theory. At a time when girls in Luxembourg could only study music privately, Koster proved to be a gifted student. Shortly before his death, her grandfather gave her his violin, a masterpiece created by the Austrian Jacob Stainer (c.1618‚Äì1683). After her grandfather died in March 1900, her mother continued her music education until she was 15, when she was sent to spend two years with her aunt Anna Hoebich in Paris so that she could learn to speak French. It was only in 1906, when she was 17, that Koster was able to attend the newly opened Luxembourg Conservatory, where she was able to continue her violin and piano studies, primarily under Joseph Keyseler (1879‚Äì1953) and Marie K√ºhn-Fontenelle (1875‚Äì1952). She apparently also learnt composition under the Belgian composer Fernand Mertens (1827‚Äì1957). Career The Koster daughters began to earn their living from music at an early age, even before the First World War. They accompanied silent films on Sundays and holidays, playing the violin (Lou) and the cello (Lina and occasionally Laura) and performed in the capital's concert caf√©s. From 1908, Lou Koster worked as a piano and violin tutor at the conservatory. Although this work was not well paid, she remained an auxiliary teacher for 13 years before she was officially appointed a piano teacher. She continued to be employed as a conservatory teacher until 1954. She also played in the conservatory's orchestra although there are no records of her own compositions having been played. As a composer, she began to write songs and light music for the piano. She went on to compose waltzes, marches and other dances, publishing 14 selected pieces in Germany and Belgium. In 1922, she composed her one-act operetta An der Schwemm (At the Baths) with a libretto by the Luxembourger Batty Weber (1860‚Äì1940). It was performed in the Pole Nord, a venue in Luxembourg City, where it was well received. In the 1920s, she also wrote some 20 light orchestral pieces for her own ensemble. They were performed in connection with competitions at the Swimming Club Luxembourg. In July 1922, her specially composed \\"Swimming March\\" was performed for the Swimming Club. From 1933, Koster's orchestral works were performed ever more frequently by Radio Luxembourg's symphony orchestra. In connection with the centenary celebrations for Luxembourg's independence in 1939, her marches \\"La Joyeuse\\" and \\"Keep Smiling\\" were performed, as well as a fantasy from her An der Schwemm. Her works were not performed during the German occupation of Luxembourg during the Second World War as they were deemed to be too French. After the war, she had difficulty in re-establishing herself. As a result, she turned from light music to more serious vocal compositions. On 22 November 1959, a concert arranged by the City of Luxembourg to present her vocal works was well received. This encouraged Koster to create Ons Lidd (Our Song), an ensemble she frequently accompanied on the piano and which increasingly performed her own compositions. Her final, longest and most important work, Der Geiger von Echternach (The Echternach Fiddler), was a choral ballad adapted from a text by the Luxembourg writer Nik Welter. It was performed in the Abbey of Echternach by the RTL Orchestra and the Chorale Municipale of Esch-sur-Alzette on 9 July 1972. It proved to be a tremendous success. Lou Koster died the following year, on 17 November 1973, in Luxembourg City.

The PRS was weakened by an ideological contradiction between socialism and reformism in an era where the political divide was very sharp. It also suffered from an organizational division between those favouring a united and structured party like the SFIO or an independent party with independent personalities. The party was dissolved in 1934. In 1945, an attempt failed to recreate it within the Rally of Left Republicans. Several PRS members headed French cabinets, including Viviani, Aristide Briand, Paul Painlev√©, Alexandre Millerand and Joseph Paul-Boncour.  Bibliography  * Jean-Thomas Nordmann (1974).

This negative affective state often occurs as a result of emotional contagion when there is confusion between self and other. Unlike empathy, personal distress does not have to be congruent with the other's state, and often leads to a self- oriented, egoistic reaction to reduce it, by withdrawing from the stressor, for example, thereby decreasing the likelihood of prosocial behavior.Tice, D.M., Bratslavsky, E., & Baumeister, R.F. (2001). \\"Emotional distress regulation takes precedence over impulse control: If you feel bad, do it!\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, 53‚Äì67.

(1987). \\"Risk, resistance, and psychological distress: A longitudinal analysis with adults and children\\". Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96 (1), 3‚Äì13. completed cross-sectional and longitudinal research on a community sample of over 400 adults and their children to examine the link between risk, resistance, and personal distress. Risk factors consisted of negative life events and avoidance coping strategies and, for children, parental emotional and physical distress. Resistance factors were self-confidence, an easygoing disposition, and family support. Outcome criteria were global depression and physical symptoms in adults, and psychological maladjustment and physical health problems in their children. The survey found that persons who simultaneously experience high risk and low resistance are especially vulnerable to personal distress. The results demonstrated that the risk and resistance variables are significant predictors of concurrent and future psychological and physical distress in adults. In children, the findings demonstrated that parental dysfunction, especially maternal risk factors and family support, are significantly linked to distress. However, these findings also suggested that, in comparison to adults, children may be more resilient to past negative life events affecting their current or future levels of distress. Furthermore, it was noted that children are affected more by mothers' than fathers' functioning, which is congruent with the conventional role of mothers as primary caregivers and with children's relatively stronger maternal attachment relationships.Sroufe, A. & Waters, E.(1977). \\"Attachment as an organizational construct\\". Child Development, 48, 1184‚Äì1199, cited in Holahan, C.J. & Moos, R.H. (1987). \\"Risk, resistance, and psychological distress: A longitudinal analysis with adults and children\\". Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96 (1), 3‚Äì13. Development A study was conducted with a group of children as well as a separate group of adults; both groups were to watch a video. The video was of a negatively emotional news story. While they watched the video their facial expressions were recorded, as well they self reported how they felt after viewing the video. The results found that there is indeed a stark difference between sympathy and personal distress. Markers of sympathy were related to prosocial responses; on the other hand, facial indexes of personal distress were unrelated. For adults it was found that facial sadness and concerned attention tended to be positively related to prosocial tendencies, children on the other hand had a negative relationship between prosocial behaviour and facial personal distress. This displays how there is not only an observable difference between sympathy and personal distress. It can also be seen that there is a difference between how children and adults experience either personal distress or sympathy this is largely related to the level of development that the individual has achieved.Eisenberg, N., Fabes, R.A., Miller, P.A., Fultz, J., Shell, R., Mathy, R.M., & Reno, R.R.

It has an area of 234 km2. Its population is 4,336. History The region was first inhabited by Indians Aimor√©s. The first European to reach those lands was Jos√© Pedro de Alcantara, followed by Manoel Francisco de Paula Cunha, the National Guard deserter, fugitive of the War of Santa Luzia, in 1842. The town had its beginning on the farm of Francis Ignatius Fernandes Leon, in 1850. That year, the farmer had built a chapel on his property in honor of Our Lady of Conception. In 1920, a group of people led by Jos√© da Luz Laudelino acquired the land and donated the farm to the Catholic Church. From 1917, work began on the German migration to the region with the acquisition of land by the stream of descendants of German Carlos Henrique Saar, John Kaiser and Anthony Keller, with strong influence in the culture of the city. The village of Conception in the town of Ipanema, grew to become the district on December 27, 1948, by Law No. 336, under the name of Concei√ß√£o de Ipanema. The district was promoted to the council on December 12, 1953, by Law No. 1039. On January 31, 1955, the City Council was installed and Antonio Heringer became the first mayor, with Jos√© de Oliveira as vice-mayor. Jos√© Pedro River, which rises at the side of the river flows and Capara√≥ Doce, cut the town in half, forming four five beaches and waterfalls, creating recreational areas for the population. The river received its name in honor of pioneer Jos√© Pedro de Alcantara. The toponymy Concei√ß√£o de Ipanema is composed of two expressions: Concei√ß√£o (Conception) is the patroness of the city and Ipanema connects to the name of the neighboring municipality to which it belonged. The word 'Ipanema' comes from the Tupi language Y-pan√©ma, meaning \\"bad water, bad for river fishing.\\" References *ANACLETO, Maria Elza Rodrigues & TEIXEIRA, Rafael Anacleto.

The school was opened in 1880 on Wolverhampton Street in the west of Dudley town centre, an area which was heavily developed for housing during the 19th century to accommodate workers drawn to the town as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The school's most notable pupil, Duncan Edwards, started in 1948 and left in 1952. He was a highly successful member of the school's football team and also represented the England team at schoolboy level, as well as several other teams outside the school. He signed for Manchester United on leaving school and within three years had gained full international recognition, regarded by many as the finest footballer of the decade. He was capped 18 times by England and gaining two Football League championship medals with Manchester United before he died in February 1958, aged 21, from injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster. By the start of the 1960s, the Wolverhampton Street School buildings were becoming increasingly dilapidated and unsuitable for modern standards. In response to this, Dudley council drew up plans to relocate the school to a new site. Construction work began in 1963 on a new school on Wrens Hill Road, which runs between the Wren's Nest and Priory estates approximately one mile to the north of Dudley town centre. The new school was opened in April 1965 and named Wren's Nest Secondary School, becoming Mons Hill School a decade later. This school in turn closed in July 1990, after only 25 years in use, with pupils and staff being split between Castle High and The Coseley School and the Mons Hill buildings being taken over by Dudley College. Meanwhile, the Wolverhampton Street School was demolished in 1966 and the site redeveloped as a public car park, although the schoolhouse at the rear of where the school building once stood remains standing to this day.

At the peak valuation of his business interests in 2008, Ross was one of the 100 richest people in the United Kingdom. In 2008, Forbes ranked him #843 in the world's richest billionaires; his net worth was estimated at US$1.4 billion. In April 2015, The Sunday Times estimated his net worth at ¬£1.0 billion. In the 2020 edition of the Sunday Times Rich List, his net worth was estimated at ¬£642 million, a ¬£26 million decrease from the previous year. Early life Ross was born on 10 July 1965. He is a grandson of Carl Ross, who created one of the UK's largest commercial fishing firms from the family business, which eventually became Ross Group, and took over the Great Grimsby Coal, Salt and Tanning Company (known as Cosalt), which was founded in 1873 as a cooperative that supplied fishing fleets. Both businesses were listed on the London Stock Exchange. Ross was educated at Uppingham School. At the age of 16, his father sent him to work on a building site in Algeria, which he later described: \\"It was a defining moment because it was so bad I had to get away from it and be able to control my destiny\\". He graduated with a BA degree in law from the University of Nottingham and worked at Arthur Andersen from 1988, qualifying as a Chartered Accountant in 1991. Business activities =Carphone Warehouse= Ross had become friends with Charles Dunstone while at Uppingham. Dunstone went on to found Carphone Warehouse from a flat in Marylebone Road, London, using ¬£6000 of his savings. Two years later, he asked Ross to join the business as finance director. Four years later, the business had twenty stores and thereafter continued to grow rapidly through a process of both acquisition and internal development. While Dunstone became the public face of Carphone Warehouse, Ross (described by Dunstone as his \\"secret weapon\\"), developed and drove the high- street retail footprint of the company by buying Tandy in the UK, and developing markets in Europe and the United States. The business also expanded into other telecommunications areas, establishing the TalkTalk ISP in 2003 and taking over other providers such as AOL. When Ross assisted the IPO of Carphone Warehouse in 2000, the company had been so successful that the partners had not needed to borrow or involve outsiders: Dunstone owned half, Ross a third, and Guy Johnson most of the rest. Ross was finance director from 1991 until 1996 and then joint-Chief Operating Officer of the company until 2003. He started to reduce his role from 2003, was appointed deputy chairman in July 2005 and by 2008 was a non-executive director. The successful involvement of Ross in Carphone Warehouse created a demand for his services at other businesses. He was the chairman of National Express from 2001 and also had directorships of several other companies, including publishing and newspaper group Trinity Mirror, Big Yellow Storage, and Frontiers Capital. =Kandahar Real Estate= A private investment business called Kandahar had been formed by Ross, comprising a team that had gained much experience of the UK high-street property market as the number of Carphone Warehouse stores had grown. In 2006, Ross set up a commercial property joint venture with the Morgan Stanley investment bank. His 50 per cent investment in the venture, which was known as Kandahar Real Estate Ltd, came from injecting the one- million square foot high-street private property portfolio of Kandahar, while Morgan Stanley injected the newly completed Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth. The joint venture was worth ¬£500 million but hit problems soon after due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08; in 2007 it had to arrange a ¬£460 million refinancing deal through the HBOS bank. =2008 resignations and aftermath= Ross resigned from Carphone Warehouse, National Express and Big Yellow in December 2008 after using a large proportion of his shares in the businesses as collateral for personal loans without informing the companies, which is a breach of stock market rules. Shortly afterwards, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said that the rules on the issue, governed by the EU Market Abuse Directive, were unclear and inconsistently applied across the European Union. Although noting that the practice was also restricted by disclosure rules of the stock market's Listing Rules, the FSA said that other directors had used their shares in a similar fashion and offered a short amnesty for declarations to be made by any directors who might have engaged in such practices. The Drake Circus shopping centre, which was the largest asset in the Kandahar portfolio, was sold to British Land in January 2011 for ¬£240m. Other sales followed as the portfolio was divested during the year, including shopping centres in Bishops Stortford, Caterham, Ipswich and Market Harborough. =Cosalt= Like his grandfather and father before him, Ross was chairman of Cosalt, which by his time had become primarily a group of companies involved in offshore safety. He took on the role in 2007 and had a 12-month hiatus between 2008 and 2009 due to the problems relating to his pledging of shares as collateral, which had included those he held in Cosalt itself. Despite selling its marine division to raise ¬£27 million, the company was in dire financial circumstances by 2011, when Ross held 15 per cent of the shares and had loaned it money. Following a profits warning in October, Ross proposed to turn it into a privately owned business, offering ¬£400,000 to have it delisted from the stock market, where it had had a presence since 1971. Despite doubling his offer and pumping more money into the company through his investment vehicle, disaffected shareholders rejected it. Some individual shareholders tried in December 2012 to have the Takeover Panel and Financial Services Authority investigate Ross amid claims that he had abused his position in an attempt to buy the business cheaply. Ross said that he had acted altruistically and that the company's pension fund liabilities were now twice its value. By that time, trading in shares had been suspended due to a failure to comply with regulatory requirements by April of that year. Unable to obtain funding from existing or new lenders, or by a deal with pension fund trustees, the company was put into administration in February 2013. Ross and two banks were owed ¬£17 million and Ross held 46 per cent of the shares. The business had a ¬£50 million pension deficit when it fell into administration. According to Private Eye, after its collapse Ross bought the company's assets at \\"knockdown prices\\" and recovered \\"far more of his money than anyone else.\\" Partners from PricewaterhouseCoopers were joint administrators of the business. Amongst their actions was the subsequent sale of the Ballyclare workwear division to Ross for ¬£5.8 million. They said: \\"This sale ensured continued trading for the business and continued employment of all the companies' staff ... The alternative offers would have resulted in further insolvencies within the Group which would have resulted in lower realisations and increased costs\\". In the same year, Ross also acquired Simon Jersey, adding to his workwear portfolio. The decision of the Insolvency Service not to disqualify directors of Cosalt from holding future office has been questioned in Parliament. Jo Swinson, then a minister, said that \\"there was insufficient evidence of relevant misconduct for it to be in the public interest to investigate further since the issues raised are unlikely to be viewed by the Court as serious enough\\". She also said a potential criminal prosecution of the directors for failure to file accounts had been rejected. =Other business activities= In 2013, Ross resigned as Deputy Chairman of the Humberside Local Enterprise Partnership. He had become involved when Cosalt was investing in the area with proposals for wind-generated energy but the collapse of that company meant that he had little in the way of involvement in local business and was having to spend more of his time elsewhere. The Ballyclare workwear division was based in Barnsley and Stockport, neither of which are on Humberside. Ross, who has a strong personal interest in sport, was for some time on the board of Wembley Stadium and, with his friend Gary Lineker, was part of the consortium which rescued Leicester City Football Club from receivership, before it was later sold to Milan Mandariƒá. Other activities =Politics= Ross is a member of The Leader's Group of the Conservative Party. The group has been described by The Independent as \\"an elite diners' club whose members get frequent access to David Cameron in exchange for donating more than ¬£50,000 a year\\". In total, he had donated more than ¬£700,000 to the party by February 2020, including ¬£10,000 for Boris Johnson's leadership campaign in 2019. =Charitable activities and the arts= Ross was appointed by Tony Blair to the board of the National Portrait Gallery for a four-year term in February 2006. This was to satisfy the Gallery's desire to recruit \\"a person with senior level of financial, accounting, strategic planning and risk management skills\\". There were accusations of cronyism later in that year when it emerged that the Gallery had commissioned a photographic portrait of Ross, among other telecoms-related subjects, but the Gallery noted that he had not been involved with the organisation at the time of commissioning. , he is a trustee of the Gallery. In May 2012, Ross participated in \\"The Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012\\" charity cycle ride from Olympia, Greece to Stratford, London in aid of Andrew Flintoff and Lawrence Dallaglio's respective charities. He hosts the annual Nevill Holt Opera festival. Ross, brought up in Lincoln, sponsored the David P J Ross Vault at Lincoln Castle, which houses Lincoln Cathedral's copy of the 1215 Magna Carta and the 1217 Charter of the Forest. In July 2020, The Royal Opera House announced that Ross had been appointed as chair of its Board of Trustees. \\\\- Ross succeeded Ian Taylor. =Education= Ross founded the David Ross Foundation in 2006. It believes that \\"every child and young person has passions and talents\\" and that its intention is to \\"help them discover their strengths by offering them a wide range of world class educational opportunities\\". It has funded the David Ross Education Trust, which operates various academies and at least one free school in England. Its first academy was sponsored in 2007; by July 2014 it was running 25 educational establishments in the country. , he is a member of Nottingham University's Council. He had been shortlisted for the role of chairman of Ofsted by an independent panel in 2014 but his involvement went no further due to objections from the Liberal Democrats regarding a potential conflict of interest relating to his past political donations. =Sport= After Boris Johnson was elected Mayor of London in May 2008, Ross was his nominee to the board of the London Organising Committee of the 2012 Olympic Games. He resigned from this position December 2008 in the wake of the same event that led to his departure from the board of Carphone Warehouse. Johnson has also appointed Ross to the board of the London Legacy Development Corporation which has responsibility for redevelopment of Olympic Park in Legacy mode and to London United, the body that supported the capital's bid to be host city for the 2018 World Cup. Currently in 2013, Ross is a member of the Commonwealth Games England board. He is also a non-executive director of the British Olympic Association. Ross has supported his alma mater, the University of Nottingham to build a brand new ¬£40 million sports centre in the University Park Campus, named the David Ross Sports Village, which opened in October 2016.Olympic seal of approval for new David Ross Sports Village, 18 May 2017, The University of Nottingham Personal life Ross has a son with Michelle \\"Shelley\\" Ross, a former partner whom he did not marry but who happened to have the same surname. He has also been in relationships with high-profile women such as Saffron Aldridge and Ali Cockayne. Ross's main residence is the 13th-century, Grade I-listed Nevill Holt estate, near Market Harborough, Leicestershire, on which he has spent millions. In addition, he has, or has had, homes in Kensington and Mustique, and in Switzerland, where he spent some time as a tax exile. He owned a second country estate, at Brampton Ash in Northamptonshire; his stepsister, Fiona, was murdered there in 2006 and in 2008 he decided to sell it. He has a reputation for partying and a love of shooting, pursuing the latter interest with people such as Lineker and Richard Branson. In 2007 he bought of grouse moor in Yorkshire.

Inter-county =Club= Regan played his club hurling with his local club in Birr. His playing career coincided with a great period of success for the club. In 1991 Regan captured his first senior county championship winners‚Äô medal. It was Birr‚Äôs first county final triumph in twenty years. Birr later represented Offaly in the provincial club championship. A huge defeat of Ballyhale Shamrocks in the provincial final gave Regan a Leinster club winners‚Äô medal. Birr later qualified for the All-Ireland final, however, Kiltormer of Galway were the winners by 0-15 to 1-8.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 102 In 1994 Regan captured a second county championship title before later adding a second Leinster club winners‚Äô medal to his collection following a victory in a replay over Oulart the Ballagh.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 103 Birr later qualified for a second All-Ireland, this time with Dunloy providing the opposition. That game ended in a draw; however, Birr completely dominated the replay. A full-time score of 3-13 to 2-3 gave Regan an All-Ireland club winners‚Äô medal. In 1997 Regan added a third county championship title to his collection before later winning a third Leinster club winners‚Äô medal following a victory over Castletown of Laois. Birr later qualified for a third All- Ireland final, this time with Sarsfield‚Äôs providing the opposition. Birr commanded the game and took the lead from early on. At the full-time whistle the Offaly men had secured a 1-13 to 0-9 victory, giving Regan a second All- Ireland club medal. In 1999 Regan won a fourth set of county and provincial winners‚Äô medals, however, Birr were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi- final.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 104 He added a fifth county championship title to his ever-growing collection in 2000. =Minor and under-21= Regan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly minor hurling team in the mid-1980s. In 1986 he captured a Leinster title in that grade following a 4-7 to 1-5 trouncing of Wexford.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 40 Regan later lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland final with Cork providing the opposition. After an exciting game of hurling Offaly were the victors by 3-12 to 3-9, giving Regan an All-Ireland winners‚Äô medal at minor level.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 29 Regan subsequently joined the Offaly under-21 hurling team. After back-to-back defeated in provincial finals in 1987 and 1988, Regan captured a Leinster title in that grade in 1989.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 49 The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Offaly against Tipperary. The game was a high-scoring one, however, Tipp were the victors by 4-10 to 3-11.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 =Senior= By this stage Regan was also a member of the Offaly senior hurling team. He made his championship debut against Laois in the provincial championship in 1989 and later captured his first Leinster title as Offaly defeated Kilkenny in the provincial final. Offaly were the hot favourites going into the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final with Antrim, however, victory went to the Ulster men on a score line of 4-15 to 1-15.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 8 The significance of this victory was not lost on Offaly team as the entire team gave the Antrim players a guard of honor and a standing ovation as they left the field. In 1990 Offaly were the masters of Leinster once again, with Regan picking up a second provincial winners‚Äô medal following a 1-19 to 2-11 win over Dublin.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 27 Regan later lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, however, Galway were the victor son that occasion by 1-16 to 2-7. At the start of 1991 Offaly reached the final of the National Hurling League. Wexford were the opponents on that occasion, however, after a tense game Offaly took the victory and Regan won a National League winners‚Äô medal.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 69 Offaly lost their provincial crown later that year. After a few years out of the limelight Offaly bounced back in 1994. That year Regan added a third Leinster winners‚Äô medal to his collection following a 1-18 to 0-14 victory over Wexford. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, Regan later lined out against Limerick in the All-Ireland final. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all-time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball upfield and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. This victory gave Regan an All-Ireland winner‚Äôs medal. In 1995 Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2-16 to 2-5 trouncing of Kilkenny. It was Regan‚Äôs fourth provincial winners‚Äô medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to defend their title. It was the first ever meeting of these two sides in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end substitute √âamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equalizer Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1-13 to 2-8 winners.Munster Hurling Legends p. 142-143 In 1996 Offaly surrendered their provincial crown to Wexford. Following this defeat Regan lost his place on the starting fifteen. He made his last appearance as a substitute in a Leinster final trouncing by Kilkenny in 1999 before later retiring from inter-county hurling.

Austen challenges her readers by creating as her most attractive male character, a man whose main objective in life is to cause hurt to women. He is depicted as a man who, though not conventionally handsome, has great charisma. He is lively, witty and charming, a great asset at dinner parties, and admired by nearly all. Henry and his sister bring a fresh energy to the rather dour and oppressive atmosphere of Mansfield Park. At Sotherton his potential for disruption begins to emerge. Arrival of the Crawfords =Backstory= Henry's education had been at Westminster and Cambridge. On his twenty-first birthday, he inherited Everingham, an estate in Norfolk worth ¬£4,000 a year (now equivalent to about ¬£400,000). Henry and Mary Crawford are described as lively attractive personalities with elegant London airs, and often characterised by critics as the anti-hero and anti-heroine. Orphaned, they have been living in London with their uncle, the Admiral. The Admiral's wife is said to have favoured Mary, and the Admiral to have spoiled Henry. After the Admiral's wife dies, he brings his mistress into the house and Mary decides it is time to leave. She would have preferred to move to Everingham but Henry, unwilling to settle down, refuses. =First appearance= The Crawfords first appears in the novel in the July of the year when Fanny Price, the shy and apparently insignificant heroine, reaches her eighteenth birthday. Mary has accepted a warm invitation from her older half-sister, Mrs. Grant, to live with her at the parsonage where Dr. Grant, her husband and fifteen years her senior, has recently purchased the living. Henry accompanies his sister, intending to stay at Mansfield for just a few days but finds the local people more congenial than expected and decides to extend his visit. Mrs Grant sees Henry as a suitable match for Julia, the younger of the two daughters of the wealthy Sir Thomas Bertram, master of Mansfield Park. The elder, Maria, is already engaged to the dull but wealthy Mr Rushworth. Mary does not believe Henry will ever commit to any woman and cautions her brother not to cause too much hurt to the Bertram sisters. =Character= The Crawfords have often been portrayed by critics as those who threaten the ways and values of the countryside and, by extension, of England itself.Roberts, Warren Jane Austen and the French Revolution, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979 p. 34 Paula Byrne sets this in context, arguing that the \\"Crawfords are merely the agents of change: the real corruption rests at the door of the flawed custodians of the house, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram and Mrs Norris\\".Byrne, Paula (2013) The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things. HarperCollins Publishers. ch.12, Kindle ed. loc. Colleen Sheehan argues that Austen subtly creates the conditions that lead readers to see the Crawfords as morally ambiguous. Henry and Mary are depicted as vibrant, intelligent, witty, and alluring while, at the same time, behaving in ways that are morally repugnant. Austen puts her readers in a position where they have to exercise their own powers of observation and judgement.  Sotherton Court and the wilderness  Henry's barouche on the journey to Sotherton Court. Edmund follows behind on horseback. Sheehan says there is nothing ordinary about the superficial Crawfords or their devices and desires. \\"They are not only themselves corrupted ... they are bent upon dominating the wills and corrupting the souls of others. Rich, clever, and charming, they know how to captivate their audience and ‚Äútake in‚Äù the unsuspecting.\\" On the family visit to Sotherton Court, Henry transports the five ladies in his fashionable barouche, an upmarket vehicle with seating for four inside and two up top, in its day the equivalent of a modern convertible.Byrne, Paula (2013) The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things. HarperCollins Publishers. ch. 6, Kindle ed. loc. 2007 On the journey, Henry flirts with Julia who is seated beside him on the box. In this highly theatrical presentation, carefully crafted scenario and psychological sophistication interact with puns, allusions and hidden meanings.Edwards, Thomas R. \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park.\\" Nineteenth-Century Fiction 20, no. 1 (1965): 51-67. doi:10.2307/2932492. p. 52 Illicit misconduct is suggested from the moment the young people reach a door, temptingly open, 'which led immediately to... all the sweets of pleasure- grounds, [and] as by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out‚Äô.Byrne, Paula. The Genius of Jane Austen: Her Love of Theatre and Why She Is a Hit in Hollywood, 2017, HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition. ch. 9, Kindle ed. loc. 3518 Henry now shifts his attention to Maria, subtly undermining any vestige of respect she might have for Mr Rushworth, her future husband. The group wander through the wooded wilderness and reach a locked gate at the ha-ha. To please Maria, Mr Rushworth returns to the house to fetch the key. The dialogue is full of subtle innuendo. Henry says temptingly to Maria, \\"You have a very smiling scene before you\\". She responds, \\"Do you mean literally or figuratively?\\"Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch 10 (Kindle Location 1344-1349). The characters exploit the garden's allegorical potential.Edwards (JSTOR) p. 53-54 Henry suggests that, if she \\"really wished to be more at large\\" and could allow herself \\"to think it not prohibited\\", then freedom was possible. Fanny watches anxiously as Maria climbs round the gate, claims her freedom and is closely followed by Henry. Colleen Sheehan compares the ha-ha, with its deep ditch separating the darkness of the wood from the light of the open field beyond, to the Eden of Milton's Paradise Lost, where the locked gates open onto a deep gulf separating Hell and Heaven. The drama at the ha-ha is a symbolic forerunner of the future moral transgressions of Henry and.Maria. Both Crawfords fulfil the serpentine role as they offer moral shortcuts to happiness. Henry's flirtations cause dissension between the sisters.  Henry as actor  Henry, the life and soul of any party or society event, constantly acts; he has many personas but no depth, consistency or identity. He is immature, unable to commit. At Sotherton, Henry acts out the part of landscape improver. He is full of his own ideas for improvements to the landscape.Duckworth, Alistair \\"The Improvement of the Estate\\" pages 23‚Äì35 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 24‚Äì25 He is described as the first to go forward to examine the 'capabilities' of the walled garden, hinting at ironic comparison with the celebrated improver, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown. He reprises the role later for Edmund's intended living at Thornton Lacey, though he lacks the consistency to manage effectively his own estate in Norfolk. Henry lives for the present moment, only interested in playing the role of improver.Monaghan, David \\"Structure and Social Vision\\" pages 83‚Äì102 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York pages 86‚Äì87. Henry Crawford visits Thornton Lacey, Edmund Bertram's future living.At the first suggestion of a theatrical performance at Mansfield Park, Henry, for whom theatre was a new experience, declared he could undertake 'any character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I could be anything or everything.' During rehearsals, Fanny considers Henry the best actor of them all. However, she observes the ongoing flirtation between Henry and the about-to-be-married Maria and declares, \\"Maria acted well, too well.\\"Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch. 18 (Kindle Locations 2201-2202) Maria enjoys seeing the jealous discomfort on her sister Julia's face.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 17 Henry's need to live by imitation is expressed when he considers a career in the Church of England during a conversation with Edmund, and in the Royal Navy after listening to exciting tales of the sea from William Price. Henry is a man who constantly reinvents himself.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 16 When Henry unexpectedly falls in love with Fanny, he acts out the part of devoted lover, fully inhabiting the role. Even the hopeful Sir Thomas recognises that the admirable Henry is unlikely to sustain such a role unless Fanny responds quickly. In chapter 34, when Henry reads Shakespeare's Henry VIII aloud to Fanny, Edmund and Lady Bertram, he impersonates one character after another with great effect, even impressing the reluctant Fanny with his skill.Monaghan, David \\"Structure and Social Vision\\" pages 83‚Äì102 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York page 98. Fanny, a lover of Shakespeare, describes his reading as ‚Äòtruly dramatic‚Äô. She is awakened by Henry to the pleasures of ‚Äògood hardened real acting‚Äô.Byrne, Paula. The Genius of Jane Austen: Her Love of Theatre and Why She Is a Hit in Hollywood, 2017, HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition. ch. 8. Thomas Edwards says that even when Henry, during this discussion, tries to please Fanny by renouncing acting, he is still performing. He measures his every word and carefully watches the reaction on her face.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 15 During this conversation, Austen also slips in a discussion on sermon delivery. Henry shows that he has the taste to recognise that the 'redundancies and repetitions' of the liturgy require good reading (in itself a telling criticism, comments Isabel Brodrick). He offers the general (and possibly valid) criticism that a 'sermon well-delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read'. As Henry continues, his shallowness and self-aggrandisement becomes apparent: \\"I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience. I could not preach but to the educated, to those who were capable of estimating my composition.\\" He concludes flippantly, expressing the philosophy of many a lazy clergyman, maintaining that he should not like to preach often, but \\"now and then, perhaps, once or twice in the spring\\". Although Edmund laughs, it is clear that he does not share Henry's flippant, self-centred attitude. Henry has made it clear that his interest is in the performance and not the message. Later in the novel, when Henry suggests destroying the grounds of Thornton Lacy to create something new, Edmund rejects his plans, insisting that although the estate needs some improvements, he wishes to preserve the substance of what has been created over the centuries.Duckworth, Alistair \\"The Improvement of the Estate\\" pages 23‚Äì35 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 32‚Äì33. Pursuit of women Fanny rejects Henry = Abandonment of Maria = Following Henry's attentions, first at Sotherton, and then during the theatricals at Mansfield Park, Maria anticipated a proposal from Henry. Henry however departs without explanation so Maria persists with her earlier plan to marry Mr. Rushworth despite despising him. She marries to spite Henry and to escape her family home where she feels stifled. Henry rarely expresses any remorse for the injuries he causes to the women he pursues. = Pursuit of Fanny = After Maria and Julia leave Mansfield Park, Henry revisits. When he complains about Sir Thomas having shut down Lovers' Vows, Fanny expresses firm disapproval, attracting his attention for the first time.Monaghan, David \\"Structure and Social Vision\\" pages 83‚Äì102 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York pages 93‚Äì94 He realises she does not like him and decides to amuse himself by making her fall in love with him. He becomes obsessed with 'knowing' her, with achieving the glory and happiness of forcing her to love him. He plans to destroy her identity and remake her in an image of his own choosing.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 p. 12 (JSTOR pp. 56-57) Fanny, who alone had observed his flirtations with her cousins, resists him. Henry unexpectedly declares to his sister that he has now genuinely fallen in love with Fanny and speaks of her sweet conduct and forbearance. Mary identifies the only real attraction for Henry as Fanny's resistance to his charms. To make himself seem better in Fanny's eyes, Henry persuades his uncle, an admiral, to use his influence in the Royal Navy to obtain a promotion for Fanny's brother William from midshipman to lieutenant. He then proposes to Fanny, but to his surprise, she refuses him, not only because of his moral failings but because she is secretly in love with her cousin Edmund. Fanny's uncle, Sir Thomas, is displeased and demands that she marry Henry as he believes this to be a highly desirable marriage and, for her, beyond all reasonable expectation. Although Sir Thomas reproaches her very severely, Fanny remains resolutely opposed to the marriage. Fanny's refusal to capitulate to Sir Thomas' wish is seen by Kirkham as the moral climax of the novel.Kirkham, Margaret (2000) Jane Austen, Feminism and Fiction: Second Edition, Bloomsbury, p. 106 Henry is not discouraged and continues to pressure her and solicit her love. = Portsmouth improvements = Sir Thomas decides to send Fanny back to her own family who live in relatively poor circumstances in Portsmouth, so that she might see how marriage to Henry would be a better option. While she is there, Henry visits, attempting to prove that he is more constant than she believed and that he is a better manager of his Norfolk estate than she thought possible. He also demonstrates that he is fully accepting of her Portsmouth family's state. Fanny, though impressed by his apparent improvement, still refuses him. Her final word to him is that he examine his own conscience, a challenge which the reader has to assume he was unwilling or unable to do. David Monaghan says that she demands of Henry more perseverance and moral commitment than he is capable of attaining.Monaghan, David \\"Structure and Social Vision\\" pages 83‚Äì102 from Jane's Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York page 101. =Distraction and disaster= Henry returns to London, intending to go on to Everingham and fulfil his promise to Fanny to attend to his estate and be its effective master. The shallowness of Henry's feelings are exposed when, having promised to take care of Fanny's welfare, he is distracted by Mary's ploy to renew his contact with the newly married Maria. Piqued by Maria's haughty welcome, he is challenged to arouse her afresh. Her response gets out of hand and leads to an unwanted adulterous affair, soon uncovered, which brings shame and disgrace on Maria and sabotages her marriage. Henry destroys irrevocably any good impression he might have made with Fanny during his courtship. The likeable Henry, having caused widespread damage, is now recognised as the regency rake, callous, amoral and egoistical. Social perceptions of gender are such that, though Henry suffers for his sins, Maria suffers more. And by taking Maria away from her community, he deprives the Bertrams of a family member. The inevitable reporting of the scandal in the gossip-columns only adds further to family misery.Ty, Eleanor \\"Ridding Unwanted Suitors Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and Charlotte Smith's Emmeline pages 327‚Äì329 from Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, Volume 5, Issue # 2, Autumn 1986 pp.327-328. Although Henry and Maria run away together, he predictably refuses to marry her and, after considerable acrimony, they part.  Reforming Henry  A question Austen poses for her readers is whether or not Henry could have been reformed. Maggie Lane offers a sympathetic interpretation of Henry: \\"We applaud Jane Austen for showing us a flawed man morally improving, struggling, growing, reaching for better things‚Äîeven if he ultimately fails.\\"Lane, Maggie. Understanding Austen, (2013) ch.16 (Kindle Locations 3067-3068). Robert Hale. Kindle Edition. Austen's sister, Cassandra, thought Fanny should have married Henry, but despite their arguing about the matter, Jane stood firmly.Worsley, Lucy. Jane Austen at Home: A Biography (2017) ch. 18 (Kindle ed. loc. 2526). Hodder & Stoughton At the end of the book, the narrator speculates controversially that if Henry had been more patient, Fanny would probably have accepted him. For additionally, her beloved cousin Edmund, whom Fanny longed to marry, might have married Mary, had Mary not destroyed her own reputation by attempting to justify her brother's scandalous affair. Some commentators like Thomas Edwards disagree, believing that if Fanny had accepted Henry, the narcissistic regency rake would have lost interest and turned his attentions elsewhere. Colleen Sheehan concludes that \\"just as Fanny tries to remain a bystander to the production of Lovers' Vows but is drawn into the action, we the audience of bystanders are drawn into participation in the drama of Mansfield Park. Austen does not save Henry and Mary Crawford in this work; only they could save themselves. Neither does she save her readers. Our judgement must be our own.\\" Portrayals *Robert Burbarge in the 1983 television serial Mansfield Park. *Alessandro Nivola in the 1999 film adaptation. *Joseph Beattie in the 2007 BBC television drama Mansfield Park.

It was part of Worcestershire until 1966 and briefly part of Staffordshire until 1974. History The development of Eve Hill as a residential area began in the mid-19th century, as the population of Dudley was soaring as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Hundreds of houses were built in the area around Salop Street which formed part of the main road leading to Sedgley and eventually Wolverhampton. St James's Parish Church was opened at this time to serve Eve Hill and the surrounding area. A new infants school, St James's, was opened on the corner of Salop Street and Himley Road in 1842. Dudley Teacher Training College (later absorbed into the University of Wolverhampton) opened off Salop Street in 1905. Further development took place in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, with a mix of private and council housing being built on the land stretching towards the Priory Estate that was developed before the Second World War. The original part of Eve Hill, however, was still standing by the start of the 1960s, and by this stage most of the houses in the area were in an unfit condition with outdoor toilets, tin baths, and no electricity or running water. Dudley council decided to demolish the bulk of the older houses around Eve Hill in 1962, and by the end of the decade the landscape had altered drastically. The older houses had been levelled, with many families being rehoused on new council estates like Russells Hall, and the site had been redeveloped with three multi-storey blocks of council flats - Millfield Court, Prince of Wales Court, and Butterfield Court - being occupied by 1969. These tower blocks were 19, 19 and 16 storeys high respectively. A shopping parade including a butcher's shop and a Post Office were built in the shadow of Millfield Court. However, the tower blocks soon fell into disrepair and were blighted by crime, and refurbishment and concierge programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s did little to solve these problems. In March 1998, the council decided to demolish the two tallest tower blocks while retaining the third, and by the following April all of the 170 residents in the condemned tower blocks had been rehoused. The tower blocks were flattened in a controlled explosion on 18 July 1999, by which time the remaining block had been refurbished. Meanwhile, University of Wolverhampton sold the old Teacher Training College and the 1960s extensions on the completion of a new campus in Wolverhampton city centre in 2002. The modern buildings were taken over by Dudley College, while the old Teacher Training College was demolished and redeveloped as a private housing estate. Shaver's End Water Works opened on Highland Road at Eve Hill in 1926. Bishop Milner Catholic College opened on Burton Road in 1960 and remains in existence today, although most of it was rebuilt during the early-to-mid 2000s (decade). The Eve Hill area effectively expanded in 1966 when Sedgley Urban district was absorbed into Dudley in 1966 and the borders of Dudley as a town were extended approximately one mile north-west. This area included Burton Road Hospital, parts of which dated back to an 1859 workhouse and had only become a hospital in about 1900. This hospital remained opened until December 1993 and it was demolished within a year, and since its demolition the site has been extensively developed for upmarket private housing. An ambulance station was also opened next to the hospital a few years before its closure, while since its closure a new fire station (replacing the building on Tower Street in the town centre) opened in the old hospital grounds in 1998.

Regarded as one of Offaly's greatest-ever full-backs, Kinahan made his first appearance for the team during the 1991-92 National League and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2001 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, two Leinster medals and three All- Star awards. Kinahan was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Kinahan is a three-time county club championship medalist with Seir Kieran. Playing career =Club= Kinahan played his club hurling with the Seir Kieran club and enjoyed much success. Having ended up on the losing side in a number of county finals, Seir Kieran reached the championship decider once again in 1995. St. Rynagh's provided the opposition on that occasion. After a 1-13 apiece draw, Seir Kieran went on to win the replay. It was Kinahan's first championship medal. Both Seir Kieran and St. Rynagh's met again in the 1996 championship decider and, once again, the game was a close affair. Kinahan's side were two points in arrears with two minutes to go, however, Seir Kieran battled back to win by 0-13 to 1-8. It was a second championship medal for Kinahan. Three-in-a-row proved beyond Seir Kieran, however, the club qualified for a fifth successive championship decider in 1998. Once again St. Rynagh's provided the opposition, however, a draw was the result on that occasion. Seir Kieran went on to win the replay by 1-11 to 0-6, giving Kinahan a third championship medal in four seasons. =Inter-county= Kinahan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly under-21 hurling team. He won a Leinster medal in this grade in 1991 following a 2-10 to 0-12 defeat of Kilkenny. Offaly later reached the All- Ireland decider with Galway providing the opposition. A 2-17 to 1-9 trouncing was the result for Kinahan's side on that occasion. Offaly retained their provincial title in 1992, with Kinahan winning a second Leinster under-21 medal following a 1-15 to 2-10 defeat of Kilkenny. Once again Offaly reached the All-Ireland final, this time with Waterford providing the opposition. A 4-4 to 0-16 draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford were more effective in the replay. A 0-12 to 2-3 score line resulted in a second All- Ireland defeat for Kinahan. Kinahan made his senior debut for Offaly in a National Hurling League game against Tipperary in 1992. He was a regular during the next few National League campaigns but was an unused substitute during the championship. In 1994 Kinahan made his championship debut for Offaly in a provincial semi-final against Kilkenny. He later lined out in his first provincial decider. A 1-18 to 0-14 defeat of Wexford gave Kinahan his first Leinster medal. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, he later lined out against Limerick in the All-Ireland final. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all- time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball up the field and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. This sensational victory gave Kinahan a second All-Ireland medal. He finished off the year by collecting his first All-Star award. Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2-16 to 2-5 trouncing of Kilkenny in 1995. It was Kinahan's second provincial medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to put back-to-back All-Ireland titles together for the first time ever. It was the first-ever meeting of Offaly and Clare in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end substitute √âamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equaliser Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1-13 to 2-8 winners. In spite of this defeat Kinahan later collected a second All-Star award. After a couple of seasons in the doldrums Offaly emerged again in 1998, however, the year was not without controversy. That year Kinahan's side reached the Leinster final but lost by five points to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. That game ended in a draw 1-13 apiece draw and had to be replayed. The replay, however, was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Kinahan's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final in a repeat of the provincial decider. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest performances. Despite suffering from flu, he started in defence and was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1-6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by six points. Kinahan secured a second All-Ireland medal before later winning a third All-Star award. Offaly surrendered their championship crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats\\". Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14. Kinahan retired from inter-county hurling in January 2002. =Inter-provincial= Kinahan also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games.

The commonest variety is white with three spiral bands one near the suture, one above and one beneath the periphery. But some shells have the ground-colour brownish with darker bands, and some are white or dark brown throughout. The parietal wall of the aperture and the area around the umbilicus are never darker than the adjacent portion of the last whorl.  Anatomy  Reproductive system of Ariophanta laevipes containing love dart (d). The reproductive system of Ariophanta laevipes includes a love dart. The teeth on the radula have the formula 120 . 2 . 8 . 1 . 8 . 2 . 120 (130 . 1 . 130). The rhachidian tooth is tricuspid. The eight inner laterals are bicuspid and broad, forming a narrower median line than in other species of the genus, i.e. 17 teeth to 45 in the latter. The admedian teeth are bicuspid up to the 104th.  Distribution  This species lives in India. In Bombay it is common in gardens. It also occurs in the Ilajpipla Hills, east of Surat.  Life cycle  The egg of Ariophanta laevipes is elliptical, longitudinally sulcated, enclosed in a tough membrane, and 4 to 5 mm in length, 4-4.5 in diameter.

Whelehan made his first appearance for the team during the 1998 championship and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2004 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal. Whelehan was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Whelehan is a three-time All-Ireland medalist with Birr. In addition to this he has also won five Leinster medals and ten county club championship medals. Whelehan's father, Pad Joe, and his brothers, Brian and Barry, also played hurling with Offaly. Playing career =Club= Whelehan plays his club hurling with Birr and has enjoyed much success during a lengthy career. By 1997 Whelehan was a regular member of the starting fifteen. That year he won his first county championship medal following a 0-14 to 2‚Äì4 defeat of Seir Kieran. He later added a Leinster medal to his collection following an 0-11 to 0‚Äì5 defeat of Castletown. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Birr take on Sarsfield's of Galway. Darren Hanniffy scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes and gave Birr a lead that they would never surrender. A 1-13 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Whelehan his first All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their titles the following year, Birr bounced back in 1999. A 3-15 to 1‚Äì11 defeat of St. Rynagh's gave Whelehan a second championship medal. A subsequent 1-16 to 0‚Äì11 defeat of Castletown gave Whelehan a second Leinster medal. Whelehan won further championship medals in 2000 and 2001 as Birr retained their status as the kingpins of Offaly hurling. Once again Birr defeated Castletown in the provincial decider to give Whelehan his third Leinster medal. Once again Birr qualified for the All-Ireland final with Clarinbridge providing the opposition. A Declan Pilkington goal inside sixty seconds was the perfect start, although the Westerners did recover to lead by 1-4 to 1 -2 at the break. With wind advantage, Birr took control and secured a 2-10 to 1‚Äì5 victory. It was Whelehan's second All-Ireland medal, his first as captain. Birr continued their dominance in 2002 with Whelehan winning a fifth championship medal following a 3-12 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Kilcormac-Killoughey. He later added a fourth Leinster medal to his collection following a 2-5 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of Young Irelands in deplorable conditions. Birr later faced Dunloy in the All-Ireland decider. At the third time of asking Birr finally retained the title with a 1-19 to 0‚Äì11 victory. It was Whelehan's third All-Ireland medal. In 2003 Birr defeated Ballyskenach by 1-18 to 1-11 to secure their fifth successive county championship. It was Whelehan's sixth championship medal. A record six-in-a-row proved beyond Birr, however, Whelehan won his seventh championship medal in 2005 as his side beatCoolderry by 0-20 to 0‚Äì5. It was the start of another great run of success for Birr as the club retained their titles in 2006 and 2007. Later that year Whelehan won his fifth and final Leinster medal as Birr narrowly defeated Ballyboden St. Enda's by 1-11 to 0‚Äì13. Birr later had the chance to make history by becoming the first club side to win five All-Ireland titles, however, Portumna easily defeated Whelehan's side by 3-19 to 3‚Äì9 in the decider. In 2008 Whelehan won a tenth championship medal as Birr defeated Kinnitty by 1-15 to 0‚Äì15. It was a fourth successive county title for Birr. =Inter-county= Whelehan made his senior debut for Offaly in a Leinster championship game against Meath in 1998. He played no part in Offaly's subsequent provincial final defeat by Kilkenny. This defeat prompted the Offaly manager, Babs Keating, to describe the team as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All- Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed, however, the replay was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Whelehan's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest-ever Offaly performances, scoring 1‚Äì6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2-13 to 1‚Äì16. It was Whelehan's first All-Ireland medal. Offaly surrendered their All-Ireland crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats\\". Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14. The following few seasons proved difficult as Kilkenny went on to dominate the provincial championship. Whelehan decided to retire from inter-county hurling after the 2004 championship. =Inter-provincial= Whelehan also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games. He won a Railway Cup medal in 1998 as Leinster narrowly defeated Connacht by 0-16 to 2‚Äì9.

The Law Code of Manu. 2.6. The four sources of dharma are: ≈õruti (Vedas); sm·πõti, \\"that which is remembered, tradition: Dharma≈õƒÅstra, Puranas, Epics; ƒÅcƒÅra, good custom; and ƒÅtmatu·π£·π≠i.Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. The Law Code of Manu. 2.6. Etymology Atmatusti is usually translated into English as being \\"what is pleasing to oneself.\\"Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. The Law Code of Manu. 2.6. Other scholars have used different terms to describe atmatusti. For example, Derrett's translation from French to English of Lingat's ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Classical Law of India‚Äô‚Äô has coined the term ‚Äúinner contentment‚Äù in reference to atmatusti. Lingat states that inner contentment can be best understood as \\"the approval of one's conscious\\". Acceptance within the Hindu tradition The first three sources of law are rooted in the vedas, whereas atmatusti is not. It is because of this that atmatusti, as a fourth source, is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy. Only Manu and YƒÅj√±avalkya refer to atmatusti as the fourth source of dharma within the Hindu Law tradition. Textual accounts of Manu's and Yajnavalkya's placement of atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma can be found in The Law Code of Manu 2.6 and The Law Code of Yajnavalkya 1.7. Also, atmatusti does not share the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara. Atmatusti differs significantly from the other three sources of dharma in that it is not based on an \\"authority exterior to man\\"; in other words, an individual is able to create their own authority for any issue not covered under sruti, smriti, and acara. According to Davis, \\"When the Mimamsa method came to be applied to the texts of the smrti it left very little room for atmatusti. ([Lingat] 1973:6).\\"Davis, Jr. Donald R. 2007. pp. 51-68. Textual accounts There are only two instances where Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source of dharma within the dharmasastras. The first instance comes from The Law Code of Manu or Manava Dharmasastra (MDh). The Laws of Manu are commentaries on the dharmasastras by a sage named Manu and therefore is considered apart of smriti. Because of this, The Law Code of Manu has a great amount of authority. However, Manu's view of Atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma seemingly was not shared universally with other sages; except a sage named Yajnavalkya. This is understood through the lack of other smriti texts or dharmasastra commentaries in which Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source. Manu lists atmatusti along with sruti, smriti, and acara as being ‚Äúthe four visible marks of the law‚Äù.Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. The Law Code of Manu. 2.12. Manu's use of the phrase \\"the four visible marks of law\\", however, is not explained in relation to atmatusti legitimately being a fourth source of dharma. The significance here is therefore based interpretation. The first textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma is as follows: The second instance comes from The Law Code of Yajnavalkya (YDh). Here Yajnavalkya, in addition to listing Atmatusti as a fourth source, also lists a fifth source of dharma: \\"the desire born of proper intention.\\" However, Yajnavalkya is the only person to list this fifth source; therefore, its recognition among scholars is almost non-existent. The lack of support within the dharmasastras as a whole shows that the Hindu community, for the most part, did not find Yajnavalkya's fifth source of dharma correctly listed or legitimate.Davis, Jr. Donald R. The Spirit of Hindu Law. Ch. 1. The second textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma along with the listing of a fifth source is as follows: Role of Atmatusti within Hindu Law The appointment of atmatusti as a fourth source can be understood by looking at the hierarchy of the sources. The authority of each source is outlined along with the authoritative relationship the sources have on one another. Sruti, the first source, is superior and has more authority than Smriti and Acara. Smriti, the second source, in turn has authority over Acara, the third source. This is understandable in that the vedic texts are superior to tradition. Hence, it is only when the vedic texts do not provide the necessary dharma needed; will tradition or the secondary vedic texts be sought out. And, only when tradition does not provide the dharma on a specific topic should customary laws be looked into. Therefore, Manu appoints atmatusti as a last resort and fourth source of dharma for instances where the vedas, tradition, and customs all do not provide the necessary dharma or law. Atmatusti creates a guide in which a person does not obey laws because it is what they were told to do, but because the person has reverence for the law. It can be used to do what is a right in the context of legal manners, but it is generally not viewed as a moral compass that believers should follow. However, the legal aims of atmatusti are usually consistent with the Veda, seeing as the person's inner-self is partly built on by the individual's education. Therefore, the atmatusti is closely connected with a more highly acknowledged source of dharma.Davis, Donald R. 2007. ‚ÄúOn Atmatusti as a Source of Dharma.‚Äù Journal of the American Oriental Society: 294-295.

History The hospital has its origins in the infirmary for the Dudley Union Workhouse which was built to the west of the main workhouse site in the 19th century. The workhouse was converted into a hospital and, in the late 1920s, it became known as the Dudley Institution. Additions to the institution at that time included a maternity hospital which was completed in 1926 and which was re-named the Rosemary Ednam Maternity Hospital in memory of Lady Ednam who had died in an air crash in July 1930. A donation by the Rotary Club enabled Burton Road Hospital to receive the country's first mobile cardiac unit in 1971. The maternity unit continued to provide maternity services to the local area until they were transferred to a new 118-bed maternity unit at the Wordsley Hospital in the late 1980s. Following the transfer of the remaining services to Russells Hall Hospital and Bushey Fields Hospital, the hospital closed in December 1993 and the site has since been redeveloped for housing.

He is known for his performances and photographs, which were germane in the development of the punk scene in Boston in the 1970s and the art world boom of the mid to late 1980s in New York City. By the time of his death he had created some 2,000 pieces of work.Adams, Brooks. (March 2011). \\"Beautiful, Dangerous People\\". Art in America, pp. 127-128; ISSN 0004-3214 Life and career Born to a drug-addicted mother in Malden, Massachusetts, Morrisroe left home and began hustling under the name Mark Dirt at the age of 15. His mother was a tenant of Albert DeSalvo, who would become known as \\"the Boston Strangler\\", and Mark often told people he was DeSalvo's illegitimate son. When he was 17 years old, a disgruntled client shot him in the back, leaving him with a bullet lodged next to his spine for the rest of his life. The experience had a profound influence on his art, which often incorporated images of young prostitutes and X-rays of his injured chest. He attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he made friends with several soon-to-be-well-known artists, including Nan Goldin,Matt McCann. \\"Multiple Exposure: Mark Morrisroe\\", The New York Times Style Magazine, March 10, 2011. David Armstrong, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Stephen Tashjian (aka Tabboo!, with whom he founded the drag duo \\"Clam Twins\\" at the Pyramid Club in NYC's East Village), Gail Thacker and Pat Hearn. His boyfriend in Boston was Johnathan Pierson, who later changed his name to Jack Pierson. He graduated from the Museum School with honors receiving the coveted \\"5th\\" Year\\" Award. While attending, he performed as a drag character of his own creation, Sweet Raspberry, and co-founded a zine called Dirt Magazine with his friend Lynelle White, distributing it in Boston nightclubs. This zine was composed of fake news and gossip about celebrities, bands and other famous people, mostly from Boston.Spex #337 (March/April 2012): \\"Mark Morrisroe. Leuchtende K√∂rper in rumpeliger Umgebung\\", pp. 74-77. His career as a photographer began when he was given a Polaroid Model 195 Land camera. He experimented with unusual development techniques, receiving generous support of supplies, film, and chemicals from the Polaroid Corporation. Within his close circle of friends he soon laid claim to the \\"invention\\" of what are called \\"sandwich\\" prints‚Äîenlargements of double negatives of the same subject mounted on top of one another ‚Äî which yielded an elaborate pictorial quality, producing a very iconic painterly impression in the final result, which over time he learned to use in an increasingly controlled way. Early on, the artist recognized the intrinsic value of prints‚Äîirrespective of the medium used to produce them‚Äîas pictorial objects that he could manipulate, color, paint, and write on at will. Thus, Morrisroe scrawled comments, biographical notes and dedications on the side of his pictures, which made them very personal pieces of art. His photographs were mostly portraits, and his subjects included lovers, friends, hustlers, and people who visited his apartment. He also often incorporated stills from Super 8 films. There are a few photographs which incorporate landscapes and external shots. Death Morrisroe died on July 24, 1989, aged 30, in Jersey City, New Jersey from complications of AIDS. His ashes are scattered in McMinnville, Oregon on the farm of his last boyfriend, Ramsey McPhillips. He is considered a member of the Boston School of Photography and his work is found in many important collections including that of the Whitney and MOCA of Los Angeles. The estate of Mark Morrisroe (Collection Ringier) is currently located at the Fotomuseum Winterthur.

Monument in Liubech (1997) by Giennadij Jerszow Another session followed in (near Kiev) on August 10, 1100, known as the Council of Uvetichi. The council, initiated by Vladimir II Monomakh, brought together Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, Vasilko Rostislavich, David Svyatoslavich, Oleg Svyatoslavich, and other Rus' princes. It aimed to stop the , to pacify the people, and to present a unified front against the Polovtsy (Cumans). It resulted in the division of Kievan Rus' among the princes, letting their immediate families inherit them. This broke a rota system (lestvichnoe pravo) that had been followed in Kievan Rus' for two centuries. The Council assigned/confirmed the principalities as follows: * Sviatopolk II received Kiev, Turov, Pinsk, and the title of the Grand Prince. * Vladimir II Monomakh received Pereyaslavl, the Rostov-Suzdal lands, Smolensk, and Beloozero. His son Mstislav received Great Novgorod. * Oleg, Davyd, and Yaroslav, both sons of Sviatoslav II of Kiev (Grand Prince of Kiev, 1073-1076), received Chernigiv, Tmutarakan, Ryazan, and Murom. Of the remaining izgoi princes: * David Igorevich received Volodymyr-Volynskyi. * Volodar Rostislavich - Peremyshl. * Vasilko Rostislavich - Terebovl. This change effectively established a feudal system in Kievan Rus'. It stopped the struggle for Chernigov, but was not observed perfectly. After the death of Sviatopolk in 1113, the citizens of Kiev revolted and summoned Monomakh to the throne. Nevertheless, the new dispensation allowed other principalities to consolidate their power and to develop as powerful regional centers: most notably Galicia- Volhynia and Vladimir-Suzdal.

The squadron was first activated at Hamilton Field, California in 1941 as the 42d Pursuit Squadron. It deployed to Alaska where it participated in combat during the Aleutian Campaign. It returned to the United States, where it became a training unit and was disbanded in a general reorganization of the Army Air Forces in 1944. From 1947 to 1949 the squadron was active in the Air Force reserve as the 42d Fighter Squadron, but was not fully manned or equipped. The squadron was redesignated the 42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated in 1953 as an air defense unit in the midwestern United States. It flew North American F-86 Sabres until it was inactivated in 1958. The squadron conducted undergraduate pilot training as the 42d Flying Training Squadron at Columbus Air Force Base from 1990 to 1992. History =World War II= P-39 of the 42d Fighter Squadron in Alaska The squadron was activated at Hamilton Field, California as the 42d Pursuit Squadron on 15 January 1941, as one of the three original squadrons of the 54th Pursuit Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 116‚Äì117 It trained with Curtiss P-36 Hawks and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, then moved to Everett Army Air Field, and served as a part of the air defense force for the Pacific coast during the first few months of World War II. The squadron was redesignated as a fighter unit in May 1942. On 12 June 1942, the air echelon of the 42d took its newly assigned Bell P-39 Airacobras to Nome, Alaska, where it served in combat against the Japanese forces that invaded the Aleutian Islands during the summer of 1942. The squadron was credited with the destruction of seven enemy aircraft in aerial combat.Newton & Senning, p. 555 P-51B 43-12252 of the 42d Fighter Squadron at Hillsborough Army Air Field in April 1944 The air echelon returned to the United States in December 1942 and rejoined the group, which had been assigned to Third Air Force in Louisiana, and became a replacement training unit (RTU) for North American P-51 Mustang pilots. RTUs were oversized units training individual pilots or aircrews.Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi In early May 1943, the 54th Fighter Group began a split operation, with headquarters and the other squadrons of the group relocating to Bartow Army Air Field, Florida,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 227Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 228 while the 42d was at Hillsborough Army Air Field. However, the Army Air Forces (AAF) was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 As a result, in 1944 the squadron was disbanded as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. The squadron was replaced by the 343d AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter).See =Air reserve= The squadron was reconstituted in 1947 and activated in the reserves at Orchard Place Airport, Illinois on 15 October. It was assigned to the 338th Bombardment Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 217‚Äì218 The squadron trained under the supervision of Air Defense Command (ADC)'s 141st AAF Base Unit (Reserve Training) (later the 2471st Air Force Reserve Flying Training Center), although it does not appear that it was fully manned or equipped.See Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 195. (No aircraft listed for squadron during this period). In July 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC. The 42d was inactivated when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949. President Truman‚Äôs reduced 1949 defense budget also required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force,Knaack, p. 25 At O'Hare, the 338th Group and its squadrons were inactivated, and most of its personnel transferred to the 437th Troop Carrier Wing.Ravenstein, pp. 233-234 =Cold War air defense= 42d Fighter- Interceptor Squadron North American F-86L 52-10073 at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, 1957 In February 1953 the squadron was renamed the 42d Fighter- Interceptor Squadron and activated as part of the 501st Air Defense Group at the same location, now named O'Hare International Airport. At O'Hare it received radar equipped and rocket armed North American F-86 Sabres.Cornett & Johnson, p. 115 On 18 August 1955, as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.,Buss, et al., p.6 the squadron moved on paper from O'Hare to Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Pennsylvania, where it assumed the mission, personnel and aircraft of the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 323 including its radar equipped and rocket armed North American F-86 Sabres. At Pittsburgh was once again assigned to the 54th Fighter Group.

The claimed territory were the lands from the Delmarva Peninsula to southern Cape Cod. Settled areas are now part of the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and southwestern Connecticut. There were small outposts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Its capital, New Amsterdam, was located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan on the Upper New York Bay. The most developed part of the province roughly corresponds to today's Greater New York Metro Area. Overview Placenames in most cases had their roots in Dutch and the Algonquian languages, and occasionally the Iroquoian Mohawk. At the time of European settlement it was the territory of the various Native American groups. In many cases the names of the Natives Americans used today were taken from the word for the place they made their villages, or their sagamore. Both the Americans and the New Netherlanders often gave names inspired by the geography or geology of the natural environment and described a shape, location, feature, quality, or phenomenon. The Lenape population, who had the most frequent contact with the New Netherlanders, were seasonally migrational groups around the New York Bay and along the Lower Hudson who became known collectively as the River Indians.Ruttenber, E.M.,Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001) Among them were the Wecquaesgeek and Siwanoy (to the north on the east side of the Hudson River); the Hackensack, Raritan, the Ramapough,Benson J. Lossing, Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution Volume I, chapter XXXII, Harper Brothers, New York, 1859 and Tappan (to the west); and the Canarsee and Rockaway (on western Long Island). The Munsee inhabited the Highlands and western Hudson Valley. The Susquehannock, who lived along the Zuyd Rivier, were called the Minquas. The Mohawk, an Iroquois people, inhabited the Albany region, and the valley that now bears the name. The Mahicans, defeated by the Mohawks, retreated to the Housatonic River region soon after the arrival of the Dutch. The Native Americans used wampum for transcription.William James Sidis, 'The Tribes And The States: 100,000-Year History of North America' (via sidis.net) The Swannikens, or Salt Water People (as the Europeans were called), used the Latin alphabet to write down the words they heard from the Wilden (as the Lenape were called). These approximations were no doubt greatly influenced by Dutch, which was the lingua franca of the multilingual province. Some names still exist in their altered form, their current spelling (and presumably pronunciation) having evolved over the last four centuries into American vernacular. Early settlers and their descendants often \\"Batavianized\\" names for geographical locations, the exonyms, rather than by their autonym, subsequently becoming the name of the Native Americans used today. In some cases it cannot be confirmed, or there is contention, as to whether the roots are in the Dutch or native tongue as sources do not always concur. Some can have several interpretations, while locative suffixes vary depending on the Algonquian language dialect that prevailed. Kill, meaning stream or channel, wyck meaning district,Kramers Vertaalwoordenboek: Nederlands-Engels (or its English equivalents wick and wich), and hook meaning point are often seen. Dutch surnames abound throughout the region as avenues, lakes, parks. Orange and Nassau come from the \\"first family\\" of the Dutch Republic, a dynasty of nobles traditionally elected \\"Stadtholder.\\" William III of England was also prince of Orange, succeeding to the English throne through the conquest known as the Glorious Revolution, so the appellation Orange, though sometimes named for the English king in this period, reflects his Dutch birth and dynasty. A =Acquackanonk= The name of a Unami group who lived along and between the banks of the Passaic Neck and the name of one of the state's first townships, established in 1683. Meaning \\"a place in a rapid stream where fishing is done with a net,\\" alternatively, \\"at the lamprey stream\\" from the contemporary axkwaakahnung. Spellings include Achquakanonk, Acquackanonk, Auchaquackanock, and Ackquekenon.James, B.B. & James, J.F., ed., Journal of Jasper Danckaerts, 1679‚Äì1680, New York, 1913, pages 176‚Äì7 =Achter Col= Called Meghgectecock by the Lenape, this described the area around Newark Bay and the rivers that flowed into it.

Bergencountyhistory.org.

Bergen Street In the contemporary borough of Brooklyn, Bergen Street was named for the family of one of the earliest settlers of Nieuw Amsterdam, Hans Hansen Bergen, who arrived in the province of New Netherland in 1633 as a ship's carpenter.By Name: How the Neighborhoods, Streets, Parks, Bridges, and More Got Their Names, By Leonard Benardo, Jennifer Weiss, Published by NYU Press, 2006 He came from Bergen, Norway, and was one of the few Scandinavian settlers of Nieuw Amsterdam (New York City).Hans Hansen Bergen, Genealogical and Personal Memorial of Mercer County, New Jersey, Francis Bazley Lee, 1907 Bergen initially settled on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan and later owned extensive plantations elsewhere on the island. The Bergen Family, or the Descendants of Hans Hansen Bergen, Teunis Bergen, 1866 Bergen later married Sarah Rapelje, the first child born in New York state of European parents.In his definitive book on the early history of Manhattan, New York City: The Island at the City of the World, author Russell Shorto acknowledges that Rapelje was the first child born of European parents in New Netherlands, which embraces what it now New York State. Sarah Rapelje's chair, now in the collection of the Museum of the City of New York, is also identified as belonging to the first child born in the state of European parentage. Recent scholarship in the Dutch archives of New York backs up Shorto's assertions. 14 Generations: New Yorkers Since 1624, the Rapaljes Are On a Mission to Keep Their History Alive, Steve Wick, Newsday, March 28, 2009 =Beversreede= The fort on the Schuylkill River. A possible translation could be \\"Beavers Gap,\\" from bever (\\"beaver\\") and reet (opening / cleft), which would speak to its location where it enters the Delaware. More probably reede meant a \\"quai\\" in the harbor (cf. today's Dutch rede). Alternatively, adjacent to (or opposite) the fort was the terminus of the Great Minquas Path, an 80-mile (130 km) trail from the Susquehanna River to the Schuylkill River. This was the primary trade route for furs from the Susquehannock people, and the Dutch named the trail Beversreede, \\"Beaver Road.\\"The Great Trail Pennsylvania historical marker.

Sanderson, Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City, 2009, map \\"Habitat Suitability for People\\" p. 111 In analogy to the Dutch village of Bloemendaal lying next to the town of Haarlem, so the Dutch settlers seemed to have named the small settlement next to the village of Harlem on Manhattan. =Bowery= Bouwerij was the old Dutch word for farm (contemporary boerderij).

R =Ramapo= Name for the mountains and river and towns, meaning underneath the rock, spellings: Ramapough, Ramopock =Raritan= The people, river, bay, and towns take their name from a derivation of Naraticong, meaning river beyond the island (which, considering location, could be Staten Island). Some would believe that is comes from Roaton or Raritanghe, a tribe which had come from across the Hudson River and displaced the existing population of Sanhicans.Between 1628 and 1640, the Sanhicans were driven away from the west shore of Raritan Bay by a band of Wisquaskecks, known as the Roaton or Raritanghe, who removed from their territory north of Manhattan across Staten Island and into the lower Raritan Valley. By July 1640, the Raritans were described as \\"a nation of savages who live where a little stream [the Raritan River] runs up about five leagues behind Staten Island.\\" At a peace conference with the Dutch in 1649, Pennekeck, sachem of Achter Col (Newark Bay), \\"said the tribe called Raritanoos, formerly living at Wisquaskeck had no chief, therefore he spoke for them, who would also like to be our friends...\\" Their intrusion was apparently contested unsuccessfully by Sawanoos (Southern) Lenape and Sanhicans. Consequently, the Hackensacks were separated from other Sanhican communities.

The Dutch word ronduyt is an adjective meaning \\"frankly\\" or \\"positively.\\" The word could also be broken down into its components and translated, literally, \\"round-out.\\" However, it seems unlikely that the inhabitants of Esopus had any special meaning in mind when they corrupted the Dutch word reduyt into ronduyt and rondout.

European settlers of the region named it first the Palse River, after New Paltz. Later, when it was clear that the river continued well beyond the original New Paltz patent, it took after the Waal river in their native Netherlands.

Hay, were regulars on the Grand Ole Opry until Bate's death in 1936. The band's recordings, while scant, are considered some of the most distinctive and complex string band compositions in the old-time genre.Charles Wolfe, \\"Dr. Humphrey Bate,\\" The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 30. Early life Humphrey Bate was born in Castalian Springs, Tennessee on May 25, 1875 to a prominent Middle Tennessee family. Several of Bate's relatives had served as Confederate officers in the American Civil War, including a captain-- also named Humphrey Bate-- who was killed at the Battle of Shiloh. Bate's cousin, William Brimage Bate, served as Governor of Tennessee in the 1880s.Jay Guy Cisco, Historic Sumner County, Tennessee (Nashville, Tenn.: Charles Elder, 1971), 223.Wolfe, Encyclopedia of Country Music, 30.

In November 1925, WSM hired announcer George Hay, who had developed a popular program called National Barn Dance for Chicago radio station WLS. Hay kept the barn dance format for WSM, and sought rural musicians from the Nashville area to play on the program.Wolfe, \\"Notes,\\" 3.

Three other important acts were also created during this time and they include the Hindu Marriage Act (1955), the Hindu Succession Act (1956), and the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). All of these acts were put forth under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, and were meant to modernize the then current Hindu legal tradition. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 was meant to enhance the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890, not serve as its replacement. This act specifically serves to define guardianship relationships between adults and minors, as well as between people of all ages and their respective property. Introduction This act is one of four Hindu Code Bills that were codified by the Nehru Administration in 1956. The other three Acts include the Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, and Hindu Marriage Act. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act delineates the policies regarding minors according to Indian Hindu personal law. Important definitions * A minor is a person under the age of 18 * A guardian is the caretaker of a minor, his or her property, or both. Categories of guardians include: a natural guardian; a guardian chosen by the mother or father; a guardian appointed by the court; and a person who qualifies as a guardian according to the Court of Wards. Exception: the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This Act is intended to be an addendum to the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890, not its replacement. =Overriding quality= Any former law that is inconsistent with this law is declared legally void. This law supersedes all other relevant laws. Application This Act applies to all Hindus, meaning those who belong to the Hindu religion or any of its developmental forms. These include the Lingayat, Virashiva, and those who follow Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj. Those who practice the religions of Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism are also considered Hindus. Finally, those who are not Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jewish are governed by this Act unless they can prove that prior to its passage, they were not governed by Hindu law. Both legitimate and illegitimate minors who have at least one parent that meets the stipulations outlined above fall under the jurisdiction of this Act. Natural guardians The father is the primary guardian for a legitimate boy and unmarried girl and their property, while the mother is the secondary guardian. However, the mother is the primary guardian for all children under the age of five. For illegitimate children, the mother is the primary guardian, while the father is the secondary guardian. A married minor girl‚Äôs husband becomes her guardian. For an adoptive son, the adoptive father is the primary guardian, then the adoptive mother. Each of these, if they chose, may appoint guardians of their child‚Äôs person or property. Should a parent cease being a Hindu or become a renouncer, hermit, or ascetic, that parent will lose his or her guardian rights. =Abilities of natural guardians= Natural guardians can take actions that will benefit and protect the minor and his or her property. However, the guardian cannot sign a personal covenant for the minor. The guardian cannot sell, mortgage or give away any part of the minor‚Äôs immovable property, lease this property for more than five years, or lease the property for more than one year after the child becomes eighteen. Minors and property A child cannot act as a guardian of property of minors. For a minor who possesses an undivided interest in joint family property that is already controlled by an adult in that family, a guardian shall not be appointed to manage that undivided interest. =Welfare of minor= The welfare of the minor will be the primary consideration in the appointment of a guardian.

He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round, 51st overall in the 2009 NFL Draft, and has also played for the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons. He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers. Early years Levitre played high school football at San Lorenzo Valley High School in Felton, California, where he was a two-way lineman. In his junior season, he recorded 47 tackles, two quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. He added more than 60 tackles and three sacks in his senior year. Considered only a two-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Levitre was not ranked among the nation's top offensive line prospects in 2004. He chose Oregon State over LSU, Fresno State, and Arizona, where his older brother, Erick, played center (2002‚Äì2006). College career Levitre redshirted in 2004, and played in all 11 games as a redshirt-freshman in 2005, while starting against Oregon. In his sophomore season, he started in game four of the season after senior starter Josh Linehan injured a knee in game three against Idaho. Levitre earned Pac-10 Honorable Mention as a player and academically. During his junior year, Levitre started every game at either right or left tackle, and earned Pac-10 Conference second team honors as selected by the coaches. For his senior season he was named to the 2008 Outland Trophy watch list, and started all 13 games at left tackle. He registered a career-high 91 knockdowns and 14 touchdown-resulting blocks and was earned All-American status by the American Football Coaches Association and Pro Football Weekly. He was considered the most-decorated Beaver offensive lineman since John Didion, a consensus All-America choice in the late 1960s. Professional career =2009 NFL Draft= Alongside Duke Robinson and T. J. Lang, Levitre was considered one of the best guards available in the 2009 NFL draft. He has been compared to Todd Herremans by The Sporting News, and to Josh Beekman by CBS Sports. =Buffalo Bills (2009‚Äì2012)= Levitre in the 2011 NFL season. Levitre was selected by the Buffalo Bills with the 51st pick overall in the second round of the 2009 NFL draft, and was the first college guard drafted. He is the sixth selection from Oregon State in Bills history, the first since Keith Ellison in 2006. Counted on to start at left guard, Levitre joined a completely retooled offensive line that was expected to feature two rookie starters‚Äîhim, and first round pick Eric Wood at right guard‚Äîand no players returning at the same position. He started all 16 games in 2009. On January 15, 2010, Levitre was named to the 2009 NFL All-Rookie team along with teammate Jairus Byrd. =Tennessee Titans (2013‚Äì2015)= On March 12, 2013, Levitre reached a six-year $46.8 million deal with the Tennessee Titans.Tennessee Titans agree to terms with guard Andy Levitre Levitre underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in January 2013 and still felt knee soreness just days after signing for the team. =Atlanta Falcons (2015‚Äì2018)= On September 4, 2015, the Titans traded Levitre to the Atlanta Falcons for a 2016 sixth round draft pick. In the 2016 season, Levitre and the Falcons reached Super Bowl LI, where they faced the New England Patriots on February 5, 2017. In the Super Bowl, the Falcons fell in a 34‚Äì28 overtime defeat. In 2017, Levitre started the first 12 games of the season at left guard before suffering a triceps injury. He missed the next three games before returning in Week 17 against the Carolina Panthers, where he aggravated the injury. He was placed on injured reserve on January 2, 2018.

The WFA aims to perpetuate the memory, courage and comradeship of all those who fought on all sides and who served their countries during The Great War. The Western Front Association does not seek to justify or glorify war. It is not a re-enactment society, nor is it commercially motivated. It is entirely non-political. The object of the Association is to educate the public in the history of The Great War with particular reference to the Western Front. The WFA was established by military historian John Giles, who enlisted the help of John Terraine, who had co-written the landmark television series The Great War, which was first broadcast in 1964. Giles was driven to form The Western Front Association as a result of the creation of such groups as 'The Gallipoli Association' which had been established in 1969, and - in the early 1970s - the 'Waterloo Association' which had been set up to save the old battlefield. It was in this context, over the following years, that John Giles developed the idea for an association on the First World War with its emphasis on the Western Front. It would be, John Giles was clear, \\"The Western Front\\" and not, in his words about \\"Salonica or Naval battles\\" - the definitive article 'The' was also stipulated. And thus in November 1980 The Western Front Association was established. Since its foundation the WFA has grown over the years to in excess of 6,000 members worldwide. There are around 60 branches in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The WFA is a UK registered charity, numbered 298365. Web site The website of the Western Front Association contains articles on The Great War. One of the sections of the website is a \\"For Schools\\" section which has educational resources for teachers and students. Branches With nearly sixty branches worldwide, including fifty in the UK and Ireland, the association has a representation in most counties in the UK and in most of 'main combatant' countries which took part in the Great War. Membership of the WFA is not a requisite to attend branch meetings, which are open to the public. There are no formal charges for attending these meetings, but a donation on the door is usually requested, this is typically between ¬£3 and ¬£5. Most branches hold an event at least once a month, so there are between 500 and 600 meetings up and down the UK every year in which an aspect of the Great War is discussed. The number of branches being formed is increasing. Publications The WFA publishes its journal, \\"Stand To!\\" three times a year. This contains articles on the subject of The Great War. There is also a house magazine for members, the \\"Bulletin\\", which is also published three times each year. An electronic newsletter is also available to which members and non-members can subscribe. Video resources The Western Front Association holds conferences in various venues with typically four or five speakers addressing a range of subjects. These conferences are often filmed and these videos have been made freely available to the public via the Association's web site and via YouTube. Annual Service of Remembrance The WFA organises each year the Remembrance ceremony held at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 11 November (except when the 11th falls on Remembrance Sunday). The 2014 ceremony was attended by the Prime Minister, David Cameron. Butte de Warlencourt Memorial on the Butte de Warlencourt The Western Front Association owned a small but historically important part of the \\"old front line\\" on the Somme, the Butte de Warlencourt. This land was bought by The Western Front Association in 1990 in order to ensure its future preservation. A memorial detailing the fighting that took place in the area was dedicated in a ceremony on the Butte on 30 June 1990. The ceremony involved the then President of the WFA, well known historian and author John Terraine. In October 2018, the Western Front Association announced its sale \\"at fair market value\\" to Bob Paterson who was chairman of the WFA between 2014-2016. First World War records saved =Medal index cards= The Medal Index Cards were saved from destruction in 2005. Medal Index Cards (MICs) are the original method of recording medal entitlement for soldiers who served in the Great War. Each soldier who served in an active theatre of operations was awarded a medal. The Medal Index Cards were stored at the Ministry of Defence record centre in Hayes until 2005. Due to the need to make space, the MoD sold the Hayes site for redevelopment; the MoD (which owned the cards) proposed the cards would be destroyed. No museum or archive was prepared to take them on, so the Western Front Association came forward and agreed to save these records. Since obtaining these cards, the WFA has been storing them. Many WFA members have requested copies of these, often placing the card in a frame alongside the medals. =Pension index cards and ledgers= In November 2012, the WFA announced that it has secured over six million Pension Index Cards and Ledgers from the UK's Ministry of Defence, which would otherwise have been destroyed. These are an extremely valuable primary source for family and military historians as they provide information on men (and some women) who served in the Great War and who subsequently applied for a pension. This significantly adds to the data that is available, particularly for those individuals who survived the Great War. Sound archives at the Imperial War Museum The Imperial War Museum's sound archive holds over 33,000 recordings relating to conflict since 1914. This consists of the largest oral history collection of its type in the world, with contributions from both service personnel and non-combatants as well as significant holdings of speeches, sound effects, broadcasts, poetry and music. The Western Front Association funded digitisation of the majority of IWM's First World War sound recordings, thereby widening public access to this important historical resource. Tours The WFA organises tours of the Battlefields for its members three times a year. Many of the WFA's branches organise similar tours at a local level.

Li was known for his toughness and work ethic. He joined the army in 1982, and served as air force Colonel and first-class pilot before his death. During his 22-year flying career, Li flew 5,003 times registering 2,389 hours of safe flights, and was awarded third-class and second-class honors. Li was posthumously awarded a first-class merit and a gold medal for pilots, the highest honor for a pilot. On Nov 14, 2006, Li Jianying was flying over an area populated by 7 villages, 814 households, an express toll station and a tile workshop when his fighter jet ran into a flock of pigeons. There were over 800 liters of aviation oil, more than 120 airborne shells, a rocket, and explosive oxygen cylinders. Li knew that if he ejected, the jet would go out of control, causing unimaginable loss. Li radioed in that he was going to attempt a forced landing. He attempted to set down on a river bank, but his jet exploded on impact. Li died in the crash and was awarded a first-class merit and a gold medal for pilots.

It is the first tributary of the country's chief river, the Irrawaddy, and the watersheds between it and the N'mai Hka river to the northwest and the rivers Shweli and Salween to the southeast form part of the boundary between China and Myanmar. Its source lies in Yingjiang County of Yunnan, and it enters the Irrawaddy near Bhamo, Kachin State. History In 1277 King Narathihapate of Bagan had an ambassador from Kublai Khan executed and then invaded the state of Kanngai along the Taping river, 70 miles north of Bhamo, for submitting to the Mongols. The Chinese defeated the Burmese in the Battle of Ngasaunggyan, a vivid account of which was reported back to Europe later by Marco Polo. The Chinese army advanced to Kaungsin but turned back because of excessive heat. They returned however in 1283, destroying Kaungsin and advancing into the Irrawaddy valley culminating in the fall of Bagan. Trade with China had taken place along the Taping river for centuries through Kaungsin until Bhamo became more important from the 15th Century onwards. During the Second World War the Allies built the Ledo Road from India to China across northern Burma, and before Christmas 1944, completed 354 miles to reach Myothit on the Taping river in order to link up with the old Burma Road at Bhamo. American GIs in the road gang had pleasant recollections of their time along the river trading with locals for souvenirs and hunting in the jungle. Pontoon bridges were built by engineers across 10 major rivers including the Taping. Earlier in the war, the Chinese 38th Division led by General Sun Li-Jen under the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) had fought the Japanese 56th Division along the Taping in a successful attempt at capturing Myothit in late October and subsequently driving the enemy out of their main defense positions in Bhamo, thus spearheading the drive in the construction of the Ledo Road. Flora and fauna A rhinoceros was shot in 1946 after it had crossed the Irrawaddy and then the Taping river. The Americans hunted sambar (deer), pheasants, and bear during the war, and a tame pet otter was traded for 2 boxes of matches. The Irrawaddy dolphin has been known to enter the upper tributaries of the Irrawaddy including the Taping especially when the rivers are flooded. They were observed in the 19th Century up to 30 km above Bhamo called \\"Dolphin Point\\". More recent surveys in 2002-2004 reported sightings in the deep pool area at the confluence of the Taping and the Irrawaddy, and up to 36 km upstream to Sinkan at the upstream end of the second defile of the Irrawaddy. Dam building upstream along the Taping is causing concerns as the reduced flow during the dry season could lead to loss of habitat and decline in their numbers. Development Hydropower projects are under way in the region along the Taping, and 3 dams are being built - one on the Chinese side of the border, and 2 in Burma jointly by China Datang Corporation (CDT) and the Burmese military government namely Taping 1, 33 miles from Bhamo (240 MW), and Taping 2, 26 miles from Bhamo (168 MW).

Sources Classical Hindu law was theologically based on the Dharmasastras. Traditionally these texts established the rules of dharma which could be found through three sources. Theologically the most important source for dharma was from the ≈õruti or Veda, because it was acknowledged to be of divine origin. If one could not find a particular idea in the Vedas, the Dharmasutras instructed him or her to consult the next source of authority: sm·πõti followed then by ƒÅcƒÅra and in some cases ƒÅtmatu·π£·π≠i.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. 1. pp. 2 :The Law is set forth in the Vedas and the Traditional Texts. When these do not address an issue, the practice of cultured people becomes authoritative. (VaDh 1.4-5) However, ƒÅcƒÅra was the law that was conveyed in actual practice.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. 7 =≈öruti= ≈öruti is a section of texts that are learned through hearing and are synonymous with the Vedas.Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439. Originally transmitted to ancient Rishis by way of cosmic vibration, the texts are considered the highest form of revelation.Jho, Chakradhar. 1986. pp. 59 Because of their divine origin, the texts were passed orally through the generations by a select group of people who were granted the power to interpret the texts into more tangible laws. Although the texts themselves contain no specific law codes or rules, they are the claimed source for all classical Hindu Laws.Jho, Chakradhar. 1986. pp. 60 These texts contain the four Vedas and the supplementary commentary associated with them. =Sm·πõti= Smriti, defined as tradition, is the second source of dharma and specifically refers to the written texts which cite the traditions of lawful virtuous people. These texts include the Dharmasastras.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. 1, pp. 2. Smriti refers to the collections of acara or customary law wherein learning takes place. Smriti is the testimony of people who know the Vedas and is considered as the secondary Veda. Unlike Sruti, revelation, Smriti is based on memory; specifically those of sages who transmit their memories of traditions onto men as a means of passing down their wisdom. Smriti also represents the complete set of sacred literature: the six Vedangas, the epics (the Mahabharata and the Ramayana) and the Puranas.Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1, pp. 9-10. =ƒÄcƒÅra= ƒÄcƒÅra is the third source of dharma and refers to the community norms and standards of a particular social group.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. One Traditionally, according to the dharmasastras, these standards are derived from the actions of those so fully learned in the Vedas that all their actions are aligned with Vedic teaching.Hacker, Paul. 2006. pp. 484 Such actions are looked towards for example in times when information regarding a particular instance is not found within ≈õruti and sm·πõti literature. Although theologically the Vedas or ≈õruti literature should be the primary source for information regarding Hindu law, in reality, ƒÅcƒÅra provided the basis for the working system of law during the classical period.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. Seven Along with this shift away from laws directly resulting from the Vedas came the normalization of leaders whose actions are considered ƒÅcƒÅra yet are not Vedic scholars. Over time, merchant leaders, heads of caste, and community leaders became the true sources of ƒÅcƒÅra and therefore, also became the primary source for rulings within the Hindu law tradition.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. Seven =ƒÄtmatu·π£·π≠i= Atmatusti is defined as being what is pleasing to oneself and is considered by some to be the fourth source of dharma.Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. The Law Code of Manu. 2.6. However, only the law codes of Manu and YƒÅj√±avalkya cite atmatusti as the fourth source of law.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Ch. 1, pp. 6. Most scholars do not recognize atmatusti as a source of dharma within Hindu Law because it does not have the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara. Atmatusti is used as a last resort where a person may only use it if the first three legitimate sources do not address the issue in question.Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1, pp. 6. Classical Hindu Law in Practice =Administration= Classical Hindu law in practice originates from the community, not state bodies. In this way, particular groups of society began to gain influence in the creation and administration of law. Primary corporate groups, kingships, and Brahmins were the factions which conveyed Hindu jurisprudence in practice. Corporate groups were responsible for legislating law through the conception of social norms;Davis: The Spirit of Hindu Law kingships were responsible for the administration of punishment and the worldly Hindu system; and Brahmins were responsible for ritual, penance, and the maintenance of a spiritual Hindu system.Lingat: 1973 =Judicial Procedure= Evidence of judicial procedure in ancient India was mostly derived from classical Hindu law and religious texts like the Vedas. The king was made to be the ultimate law authority within a court. Ordeals, the divine methods of proof and oaths for simple cases were used to help in the decision-making process, while ultimately basing the decision on different texts like Manu, YƒÅj√±avalkya, Dharma≈õƒÅstras, Sastras and dharma.

South Littleton is located midway between Evesham and Bidford on Avon. South Littleton is the largest of The Littletons, with North and Middle Littleton being smaller. At the 2001 census it had 1,775 inhabitants, while North and Middle Littleton had a population of 906. History Though Neolithic human activity has been documented in the area, it is thought the first permanent settlements were constructed during Romano- British times (the important Roman road of Ryknild Street runs by the area). Other nearby Romano-British at Ullington, Blakes Hill and Littleton Pastures have been documented, and all were thought to be in continuous occupation until the late 4th century. Archeological evidence suggests the area was completely abandoned after the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. The area had been repopulated to an extent by the time of the Domesday Book, which documents the Littletons twice. Later stone buildings remain in the villages today. The parish remained largely as an agricultural area until the late 1940s. Today, very few of the inhabitants of the parish are employed in agriculture.

Ananda Yoga emphasizes inner awareness; energy control; and the experience of each asana as a natural expression of a higher state of consciousness, which is enhanced by the use of affirmations.  History  Kriyananda Ananda Yoga was established by Kriyananda taking from one of the oldest Hatha Yoga systems in the West. Its roots are the 1940s/1950s, when Kriyananda was with Self-Realization Fellowship, he was taught these postures by Yogananda. Yogananda, founder of SRF and YSS, asked Kriyananda (then Donald Walters) and other young monks, to demonstrate the postures for visiting guests, as well as for public events, such as the SRF \\"Lake Shrine Dedication.\\" Kriyananda and other monks also posed for photos, for articles on the yoga postures in Yogananda's \\"Self-Realization Magazine.\\"Described in \\"The New Path\\" by Swami Kriyananda, Crystal Clarity Publishers From 1965 Kriyananda through his own organization started to teach Ananda Yoga publicly in California. The director of Ananda Yoga, Gyandev Rich McCord, is a co-founder of Yoga Alliance and a member of its board of directors.To hear Gyandev's keynote address, 'Future Directions for Yoga in the West', at the 2011 Yoga Alliance Leadership Conference: http://vimeo.com/31819734  Principles  Ananda Yoga uses asana and pranayama to awaken, experience, and control the subtle energies (prana) within the body, especially the energies of the chakras, supposed energy centres that are arranged along the spine. Its object is to use those energies to harmonize the body, uplift the mind, and above all to attune to higher levels of awareness. A unique feature of this system is the use of silent affirmations while in the asanas, as a means of working more consciously with the subtle energies to achieve this attunement. Ananda Yoga is a relatively inward experience, not an athletic practice. A main goal is to prepare for deep meditation, as Hatha Yoga is considered the physical branch of Raja Yoga in both the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Gheranda Samhita.Hatha Yoga was classically a staircase to Raja Yoga: see the first sentences of Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita.  Energization exercises  The \\"Energization Exercises\\", a vital part of Ananda Yoga, are Yogananda's contribution to yoga. He first developed them in 1916, within his organization then called Yogoda, which he changed to Self-Realization Fellowship / Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in the 1930s. He eventually expanded them into a set of 39 exercises. The goal is to tap into cosmic energy, recharging the whole body. Yogananda explains in his Autobiography of a Yogi: \\"Realizing that man's body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will‚Ä¶. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple 'Yogoda' techniques by which the life force, centered in man‚Äôs medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy.\\" References Kriyas Meditation Yoga styles ","title":"Ananda Yoga"},{"id":"20603004","text":"Pedicellarum is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.

It was built of brick laid over Dennison interlocking tile, sitting atop a limestone base. The building was trimmed with limestone and Tuscan glazed faience in various colors. The facade was a series of gable-roof blocks, roofed with Spanish tile. The primary entrance was through a central, side-gable block, sized to match the nave. The entrance was recessed into the center of a projecting porch and surrounded by columned arches. A massive Eucharistic relief was set high in the center of the facade. The church boasted a wealth of decorative art, including stained glass and bronze works. The rectory was a large, two-story building with a dormer-attic.

Single-story wings with entrance doors flank the front, and a tower is located on the right side of the building. History This collection of buildings is significant for its architectural quality. The first building of the parish, the school, was completed in 1913 by Donaldson and Meier at a cost of $52,000. The school building included a chapel and parish hall. The convent and rectory were both completed in 1926, and the church, costing $130,000, was completed in 1929. Dwindling population in the latter part of the 20th century led to a merger of St. Catherine with the nearby St. Edward's Roman Catholic Church in 1970; the buildings of St. Edward's were demolished.

It is characterized by dystonia, and abnormal and sustained involuntary muscle contraction. This may cause twisting or jerking movements of the body or a body part. Although Pisa syndrome develops most commonly in those undergoing long-term treatment with antipsychotics, it has been reported less frequently in patients receiving other medications, such as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. However, it has also been seen in those with other diseases causing neurodegeneration and in those who are not receiving any medication (idiopathic Pisa syndrome). The characteristic development of Pisa syndrome consists of two types of dystonia: acute dystonia and tardive dystonia (also known as tardive dyskinesia). The underlying pathology of drug-induced Pisa syndrome is very complex, and development may be due to an underlying dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance, or serotonergic/noradrenergic dysfunction.Van Harten: Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1997 Jul 26;141(30):1471-4Nishimura, K: Pisa Syndrome Resolved After Switching to Olanzapine. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 2007; 19:202-203M. Amore, M. Cerisoli, S. Campanile, A. Campanile: Pisa Syndrome. Report of a Case. Italian Journal of Neurological Sciences 1988; 9:273-274. Symptoms The predominant symptom of Pisa syndrome is dystonia. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contraction leading to abnormal posture, twisting, and repetitive movement. In Pisa Syndrome specifically there is commonly a tonic flexion of the trunk of the body to one side, leading to a slight lean (reminiscent of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, hence the name \\"Pisa syndrome\\"). This is usually associated with a backward axial rotation of the spine and indifferent to markedly abnormal posture. Patients diagnosed with Pisa Syndrome usually experience either acute dystonia or tardive dystonia, also known as tardive dyskinesia. Differential diagnosis between the two may be hard to accomplish without a complete patient history, since both types of dystonia may occur simultaneously in a patient. These symptoms generally disappear after discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug. The time of onset of symptoms may vary depending on drug being administered and the neurological characteristics of the patient in question. =Acute dystonia= Acute dystonia nearly always develops a few weeks after a dopamine blocking agent/medication has begun or a substantial increase in antipsychotic dosage. An acute dystonic reaction consists of sustained, painful muscular spasms, producing twisting of the trunk/body and abnormal posture. The most frequent occurrences of these spasms have been reported in the neck, tongue, and jaw. Oculogyric crisis and opisthotonus are also very common. Acute effects of dopamine antagonists also include Parkinsons-like symptoms, manifested by bradykinesia, pin rolling tremor, and rigidity of the body. These movements may fluctuate over hours and temporarily dissipate in response to reassurance, and the individual episodes may last minutes to hours. Acute reactions are more common in older patients and females. The pathophysiology underlying these reactions is unknown, but the movements usually occur during the period when blood medication level is dropping. The acute syndromes which occur due to prolonged exposure to a dopamine antagonist are collectively termed extrapyramidal symptoms, EPS. =Tardive dyskinesia= Tardive dyskinesias are involuntary movements of the lips, tongue, face, trunk, and extremities which occur in patients with prolonged exposure to dopamine antagonists or antipsychotic medications. Clinical findings have provided evidence that adenosine, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, plays a role in the development of tardive dykinesias.Bishnoi M, Chopra K, Kulkarni SK. Involvement of adenosinergic receptor system in an animal model of tardive dyskinesia and associated behavioural, biochemical and neurochemical changes. Eur J Pharmacol. Dec 15 2006;552(1-3):55-66. Tardive dykinesias have also been associated with polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D2 gene, dopamine receptor D3 gene, dopamine transporter (DAT) gene, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene.Lafuente A, Bernardo M, Mas S, et al.

Sep 2006;86(1-3):323-5 Tardive dyskinesias are chronic compared to acute dystonia, which occur in an episodic fashion. Causes Pisa syndrome is predominantly caused by a prolonged administration or an overly dosed administration of antipsychotic drugs. Although antipsychotic drugs are known to be the main drugs that are concerned with this syndrome, several other drugs are reported to have caused the syndrome as well. Certain antidepressants, psychoactive drugs, and antiemetics have also been found to cause Pisa syndrome in patients.Suzuki et al., 1997 T. Suzuki, H. Kurita, T. Hori, M. Sasaki, A. Baba and H. Shiraishi, et al. The Pisa syndrome (pleurothotonus) during antidepressant therapy. Biol Psychiatry, 41 (1997), pp. 234‚Äì236. Drugs found to have caused Pisa Syndrome: * Atypical antipsychotic drugs- ex. clozapine, aripiprazole * Tricyclic antidepressants- ex. clomipramine * Psychoactive drugs * Antiemetic drugs * Cholinesterase inhibitorsCossu et al., 2004 G. Cossu, M. Melis, G. Melis, E. Maccioni, V. Putzu, O. Catte, PF. Putzu, Reversible Pisa syndrome (pleurothotonus) due to the cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine: case report. Department of Neuroscience, Oct;19(10):1243-4. * Galantamine Based on the drugs that caused Pisa syndrome, it has been implicated that the syndrome may be due to a dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance or a serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction. For the development of Pisa syndrome that cannot be alleviated by anticholinergic drugs, it has been considered that asymmetric brain functions or neural transmission may be the underlying mechanism. How these drugs interact with the biochemistry of the brain to cause the syndrome is unknown and a topic of current research. Risk factors Typically, females and older patients with organic brain changes are more likely to develop Pisa syndrome. Organic brain changes are physical changes in the brain which lead to neurological dysfunction, including dementia and frontal lobe syndrome. This includes the presence of neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.Lamparska A, Smoczy≈Ñski S. Psychotic syndromes in patients with organic brain damage in the light of clinical analysis. Psychiatr Pol. 1990 Jul-Aug;24(4):1-6. Diagnosis Treatment and Medication There are two lines of treatment for Pisa syndrome. The first line entails discontinuation or reduction in dose of the antipsychotic drug(s). The second line of treatment is an anticholinergic medication. A pharmacological therapy for Pisa syndrome caused by prolonged use of antipsychotic drugs has not been established yet.Suzuki et al., 2002 T. Suzuki, H. Matsuzaka, et al. Drug-induced Pisa syndrome (pleurothotonus): epidemiology and management. Department of Psychiatry, 16(3) (2002), pp. 165-74. =Reduction of drug dosage= Reducing the dosage of the antipsychotic drugs resulted in gradual improvement in the abnormal posture. In some cases, discontinuing the use of those drugs resulted in complete disappearance of the syndrome. The time it took for the improvement and the disappearance of the syndrome depended on the type of drug being administered or the specific cause of the syndrome itself. =Anticholinergic drugs= Anticholinergic drugs have been reported to be extremely effective in 40% of the patients with the Pisa syndrome. Patients with Pisa syndrome that is resistant to anticholinergic drugs is mostly resolved by the reduction of the administration of the antipsychotic drugs as previously mentioned. While the specific pathology underlying idiopathic Pisa syndrome is unknown, the administration of anticholinergic drugs has provided resolution in known cases. History Pisa syndrome was discovered by Karl Axel Ekbom, a Swedish neurologist, in the early 1970s. Cases of the syndrome were first observed in three elderly female patients suffering from presenile dementia. Each of these women were undergoing treatment with the antipsychotic drug methylperone, haloperidol or a combination of the two. The use of neuroleptic drugs caused the patients to exhibit a lateral flexion along with a rotation of the trunk. As the patients walked they experienced an increase in rotation. The postural and gait disturbances symptoms is what set this apart from any other form of acute dystonia previously observed. These symptoms proved to be the making of a new dystonic reaction, which was termed pleurothotonus or Pisa syndrome.K. Ekbom, H. Lindholm and L. Ljungerberg, New dystonic syndrome associated with butyrophenone therapy. Z Neurol, 202 (1972), pp. 94‚Äì103. The first patient, a 59-year-old woman with no family history of neuroleptic disease, was put through two periods of treatment with methylperone. The first trial of the drug was administered in February 1971. In the beginning the patient demonstrated no symptoms of dystonia. However, within the first few days the patient began to exhibit a tilting to right upon walking. The women was then taken off the methylperone treatment and as a result progressively regressed back to her previous state of exhibiting no symptoms within the first two months. The patient started a second trial of methylperone treatment in late October 1971. After a little over a week of the drug treatment, she began to express previous symptoms that including a bending of the trunk towards the right along with a rotation. The patient also experienced a pulling away from her direction of walking and a difficulty of turning. Within a couple of days of exhibiting symptoms, the patient was then treated with orphenadrine. This treatment helped regress the expressed symptoms quicker than the first time. By the end of the week the patient was able to return to her normal state. The second patient to undergo methylperone treatment was a 63-year-old woman with presenile dementia, which caused her to experience restlessness and paranoid hallucinations. The methylperone treatment was able to alleviate the woman's problems induced by her dementia. It did not take long for the woman to begin to experience symptoms of Pisa syndrome and as a result she was taken off of the methylperone treatment. Like the first patient, she was able to overcome the induced symptoms of Pisa syndrome within a month. The patient was again treated with methylperone after two months from the first treatment. Soon after the patient began to lean toward the right when standing or walking. She was then administered orphenadrine, which soon stopped the patient's tilting posture. The final patient was a 69-year-old woman, diagnosed with presenile dementia after she expressing symptoms of memory dysfunction, depression and urinary incontinence. As a result, the woman was put under a methylperone treatment, which soon caused a bending and rotation to her left. These symptoms disappeared soon after being taken off of methylperone. Unlike the other two patients, when the woman was again administered methylperone she did not exhibit any previous dystonic symptoms after two weeks of treatment. The patient was then switched to a small dosage of haloperidol along with the typical dosage of orphenadrine used on the previous patients. Instead of not having symptoms of Pisa syndrome, the woman began to experience a leaning to her left side and a particular rotation of her shoulder towards the left. Once haloperidol was eliminated from the treatment the patient no longer had these symptoms. As more cases of the syndrome came about, research discovered that the switching of drug treatments can be debated as a possible inducer of the disease. Other cases of the disease have been proven to be caused by medications other than neuroleptic drugs. These patients were observed exhibiting symptoms of Pisa syndrome as a result of having a prior neurodegenerative disease. Further research Current research has been focusing on discovering the underlying mechanisms of Pisa syndrome, since little is known about the biological and pharmacological reasons Pisa syndrome occurs (although theories about dopaminergic dysfunction have been suggested). While Pisa syndrome is mostly associated with antipsychotic drugs, there have been incidents of idiopathic Pisa Syndrome, the development of Pisa syndrome in those with other neurological disorders, and Pisa syndrome in those with intellectual disability.Ulhaq, Inam, et al. Case Report: Pisa Syndrome in Patients with Intellectual Disability. Mental Health and Learning Disabilities: Research and Practice. 2010, v.7, pg. 59-63. Future research hopes to pinpoint the essential neurological disorder or disorders underlying the development of Pisa syndrome so more that more effective medication and treatment may be created and/or administered.

Like candy canes, they usually have at least two different colors (either opaque or translucent) swirled together in a spiral pattern, resembling a barber's pole. The candy has a long history in the United States, where it is believed to have been developed,Harper's Magazine, v. 73 (June-November 1886), p. 94. and is often marketed as an \\"old fashioned\\" candy. It is often sold in general stores and similar shops specializing in nostalgia items. The Cracker Barrel chain estimates that its stores sell a total length of of stick candy each year.CBRL Group, Inc. Fact Book , September 30, 2008 History Stick candy has been around since at least the fall of year 1837 when it was shown at the Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association alongside \\"lobster candy\\". Stick candy was popular with both children and adults in the U.S. as early as the 1860s, and the selling of this type of candy (particularly during the carnival season in the warmer months) was described as being lucrative.Secrets of the Sideshows by Joe Nickell, p. 33. One contemporary account describes broken pieces of stick candy being sold in paper containers, being presented by candy sellers to rural people as something special, and commanding a high price. Candy sticks were the subject of an 1885 song called \\"The Candy Stick\\":\\"The Candy Stick\\" lyrics, from PD Music.org Stick candy was the subject of a poem, \\"Stick-Candy Days\\", from the 1907 collection A Rose of the Old Regime: And other Poems of Home-Love and Childhood by the Bentztown Bard (Folger McKinsey). \\"Stick Candy Days\\", A Rose of the Old Regime: And other Poems of Home-Love and Childhood by the Bentztown Bard (Folger McKinsey) Doxey Book Shop Company Baltimore and London 1907 The first two verses are: Stick candy is also mentioned in a 1909 poem, \\"The Land of Candy\\", by Madison Julius Cawein: The Giant and the Star, p. 16 Production and marketing Stick candy can be bent when hardening, making candy canes Stick candy is produced by mixing granulated sugar (and sometimes also corn syrup) with water and a small amount of cream of tartar. The dough is mixed with color and flavoring, then drawn and twisted, producing the characteristic spiral pattern, and finally cut to the proper length and allowed to cool and harden. In the 1800s, bright red (and sometimes also bright blue) swirled with white were the most common colors. Although unbent and thicker, it is similar to a candy cane (which retains the aforementioned red-and-white color scheme). Stick candy is produced in a wide assortment of flavors, such as root beer, sassafras, horehound, cinnamon, butterscotch, pi√±a colada, peppermint, clove, spearmint, licorice, bubble gum, cotton candy, and wintergreen. They are also made in a wide variety of fruit and berry flavors. There are also varieties containing two different flavors swirled together. Stick candy is generally sold shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, and traditionally displayed for sale in wide-mouthed glass jars. They were originally sold by the piece for a nickel or dime. As of 2008 they more typically sell for 25 cents to 75 cents each, although they are also sold in bulk. Some varieties of stick candy are filled with sweet cream. Consumption As a hard candy, stick candy is slow to dissolve and candy sticks last a very long time if consumed by sucking. As with lollipops, they are most often consumed by sucking, but may also be crushed by the teeth.

In this way, particular groups of society began to gain influence in the creation and administration of law. Primary corporate groups, Kingships, and Brahmins were the factions, which conveyed Hindu jurisprudence in practice. Corporate groups were responsible for legislating law through the conception of social norms;Davis:The Spirit of Hindu Law kingships were responsible for the administration of punishment and the worldly Hindu system; and Brahmins were responsible for ritual, penance, and the maintenance of a spiritual Hindu system.Lingat: 1973 Administration of Classical Hindu Law =Corporate groups= Corporate groups in medieval India included, but were not limited to, merchants, traders, religious specialists, soldiers, agriculturalists, pastoralists, and castes. These groups held legal prominence in classical Indian society because the primary authority and responsibility for law at the time came from the community, not a state polity. Particularly, early Dharmas≈´tra (dharmasutra) texts, beginning in about the 2nd BC, recognized a full-fledged theology surrounding the household institution.Davis The texts viewed households and families as the archetype of community, \\"an exemplary institution of religious and legal reflection of Hindu jurisprudence\\". Thus, Hindu jurisprudence portrayed the household, not the state, as the primary institution of law. Connectedly, the household is the institution to which Hindu law is most applied. For example, the texts are most explicit in reference to quotidian household acts such as eating, bathing, creating a family, etc. The focus on the household and other local institutions helped to identify the shared goals and goods within society which are inherent to Hindu law. Furthermore, small-scale communities such as the household were more effective in imposing the acceptance of common values and core ideas. Because of the social implication revolving around the importance of the household and the community in the creation and administration of law, Hindu law jurisprudentially subordinated state law to the law of castes and life-stages (varnasramadharma). In this manner, each caste and life-stage was responsible for highly localized occupations. ‚Äì Table 1. Dharmas of the Castes, showing the subordinate place of political rulership I. Brahmin :a. six occupations ‚Äì teaching and studying the Veda, offering and officiating at sacrifices, giving and accepting gifts (MDh10.74-75) II. K·π£atriya :a. three occupations ‚Äì studying the Veda, offering sacrifices, and giving gifts (MDh 10.77, 79) :b. special dharmas = rƒÅjadharma, the dharma of a ruler (MDh 10.79-80) ::1. protection of the people (MDh 7.144; YS 1.323, 335) ::2. promulgation of the law of castes and life-stages (MDh 7.24, 35; 8.41, 390-91, 410-418; YS 1.361; NS 12.117, 18.5) ::3. punishment of the wicked (MDh 7.14-31; YS 1.338, 354-359) ::4. adjudication of disputes III. Vai≈õya :a. three occupations ‚Äì studying the Veda, offering sacrifices, and giving gifts (MDh 10.78-79) :b. special dharmas (MDh 9.326-333; 10.79-80) ::1. trade ::2. animal husbandry ::3. agriculture IV. ≈ö≈´dra :a. special dharma ‚Äì \\"obedient service to distinguished Brahmin householders who are learned in the Veda\\" (MDh 9.334) Although the household and family were central to corporate groups‚Äô influence, medieval India was a time of political integration over larger and larger core areas.Davis:2005 During the time, corporate groups showed increased importance in the creation and administration of law. Such influence came with the development of corporate groups as intermediary tools. These intermediate- corporate groups exercised influence in two main ways: # they moderate legal influences of both \\"highly local sources (villages, families, etc)\\" and \\"elite-level political rulers\\", which promotes pragmatic conflict resolution and the circulation of legal standards for specific groups, and # they reconcile legal norms that influence local and regional customary law with esoteric Brahminical dialogue of Dharma≈õƒÅstra which establish \\"viable ideologies\\" that respect both customary and textual law.Davis:2005 Corporate groups also created their own laws and systems of jurisprudence. Specifically, the concept of ƒÅcƒÅra in the Hindu legal texts (i.e. the Dharma≈õƒÅstra) legitimized these localized laws. ƒÄcƒÅra allowed localized corporate groups to create their own laws, especially in the situations where Hindu legal texts were vague, ambiguous, or completely silent. In particular, ƒÅcƒÅra of specific corporate groups plays out in practice as \\"norms accepted and imposed by the leaders of various social institutions\\". The key to the legitimization of these norms created and accepted by the leaders of corporate groups is the concept of the ‚Äògood person‚Äô in ƒÅcƒÅra. This principal allows for the dissemination of sastric and Vedic control over practice through the mediation of experts who are learned in the texts. Through this, the Dharma≈õƒÅstra is connected to real life in a \\"mediate\\" way.Olivelle:2004, xl ƒÄcƒÅra is also recognized and validated in a legal sense through the device of paribhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ, which deemed the conventional rules of ƒÅcƒÅra as technical supplementary refinements of the rules of the ≈õƒÅstra. =Kingships= The dharmasastras, starting with Manu, first addressed the function of the king pertaining to the administration of Hindu law. These texts define the king as ‚Äòhe who has been anointed.‚Äô Many scholars interpret anointment as the celebration of coronation rites, and thus believe that the ceremony is necessary to invest the king with supreme authority. Although no rules lay down why or how a particular individual fits to qualify as king, Manu VII.2 indicates that only a K·π£atriya has the right to kingship. Some assume this is because the K·π£atriya possessed the force necessary to obtain obedience. However, interpreters of other dharmasastras, dispute this qualifying trait.yƒÅj√±avalkya, vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara The king was considered to have a divine nature, but not because of birth or immortality. Rather, the king encompassed god-likeness through exercising the royal function, which the texts say the gods created. This royal function is the source of the king's authority. The royal function vests the king with the power of command (k·π£atra) and the mission to protect the people and give them the guarantee of security.yƒÅj√±avalkya I.323 The sastras delineate the royal function to be the king's dharma (rƒÅjadharma). Aside from physical protection from the harmful in and outside of king's jurisdiction, rƒÅjadharma protects and permits his subjects‚Äô dharma to flourish. In this way, the king's dharma encompasses all dharma since each individual's performance of his or her personal duties is dependent on the protection secured by the king. Because of this interconnectedness between rƒÅjadharma and individual dharma (swadharma) \\"the salvation of the king depends on his subjects, just as the salvation of the subjects depend on the king\\". The king's spiritual happiness depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire. This relation applies vice versa as well. Punishment and justice The royal function gives two main privileges: the right to tax and the right to punish (da·πá·∏ça), and they are benefits outlined solely for the king. Only the king may use punishment to secure the execution of his orders. Due to his ability to punish, the king possesses an unlimited power on the temporal plane, and he may do whatever he wishes. Narada says, \\"whatever the king does is justified: such is the rule.\\" Furthermore, the execution of punishment ensures justice within the king's jurisdiction, and thus the king is the sole judge of the means needed to accomplish his mission of justice. In this vein, he may act as he deems necessary for justice. Moreover, exercising the royal function to maintain justice is equivalent to the celebration of a sacrifice, which keeps the king pure no matter what actions he must commit to bring a culprit to justice. However, although a king is always justified on a temporal plane, he would suffer the consequences of poor actions in his next lives. Punishment falls under royal authority because it pertains to accomplishing true justice‚Äîa concept only the king can judge. Thus, where there is textual silence, kings are responsible for administrating trials (vyavahƒÅra) of criminal law as well as administering punishment (da·πá·∏ça) for criminal acts. King's judge trials other than criminal cases too, except when parties do not wish to appear before him. When parties do not wish to bring a complaint to the king, individuals and corporate groups conduct their own trials. In these cases, although corporate groups such as castes and vocational sects have their own jurisdiction (which came from customary origins) they are still in the king's control. The king exercises this control through the recognition of a corporate group's particular jurisprudence. Recognition is important because the king's court is the only jurisdiction Dharmasastras identifies, thus the king's acceptance of other courts transfers sastric meaning to the particular jurisdictions. The king also employs danda when the Dharmasastra gives more than one penalty for a crime or when texts are contradictory. He is a source of last resort on questions of both fact and law, but once the king passes judgment it is not up for review. Lawmaking Kings were not very active in legislating especially for the reason that Hindu legal texts always preceded the authority of the king. In this way, kings were limited in their ability to make laws on conduct because the Veda already outlined dharma. Judgments made by the king were never law, but considered orders. These orders did not change laws or give new interpretations to texts but merely secured order and peace to the king's jurisdiction. More reasonably, the king was an administrator rather than a legislator. As an administrator, the king maintained peace between his subjects rather than made laws. In addition, royal authority did allow the king to divide tasks of administration amongst ministers and to define the scope and the powers of each ministry. Davis further attributes the lack of royal legislation or edict to the social context presumed by Hindu jurisprudence (i.e. the subordination of the state to the household). In this way, \\"the state is jurisprudentially part of the household dharma of the ruler\\" Davis: The Spirit of Hindu Law =Brahminical jurisprudence= The Brahmin was an integral part of the administration of classical Hindu law. For Gautama, the Brahmins and the king sustain the divine order of the world, the Brahmins with their council and the king by punishment. In this way, dharma cannot come to fruition without the two castes‚Äô cooperation. The Brahmin's opinion is the only counterbalance to the king's authority in society, and because of this, the texts say that the king cannot make a decision without the advice of a Brahmin. For this reason, Brahmins have a right to participate in the court of justice. Additionally, when a king cannot preside over a case himself, a Brahmin must be appointed to take his place. The Brahmin not only gives advice on the administration of justice but also in affairs of the state. \\"Brahmin is master when the question is one of ritual and of penance. But his scope extends in reality over all the field of royal activity, as much on its political side as on its religious\\". The superiority of the Brahmin is not attached to their birth (varna) but to the fact that they are devoted to the study of the Veda, and thus are qualified to instruct other people. Because of this devotion to the Veda, the Brahmin is more closely in line with the divine than the king. Thus, Gautama says, the king is the master of all with the exception of the Brahmin. Such high ranking in the classical Hindu law system is apparent in that Brahmin's are exempt from taxes, and may own land (something that is reserved for only kings and Brahmins). Judicial practices of Classical Hindu Law There are no references of Judicial procedure in early Vedic times but there was a frequent mention of the term Rta implying that there was a divine cosmic order by which the universe was regulated. The idea of Dharma seems to have developed from Rta, since Dharma later became the word commonly used in ancient India to designate law. The Rig Veda provides little evidence of civil law. In ancient India Dharma had a religious basis and was enforced by religious threat. It changed not by the will of the king but the evolution of social custom usages and practices.Das: 1977. 93-127. During the Brahmana period, the process of giving punishments to culprits was formed and for this reason law-assistants were appointed. The full Judicial procedure came into light during the composition of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras and Smrtis. King figures appeared as the highest judicial authority with a network of courts established under him. The courts consisted of ten members King, Pravivaka, the Sabhyas, the Ganika (accountant), the Lekhaka (Clerk) and court inspector. * Kings at the center of the court, facing the east- Sabhyas and Pradvivka on his right facing the north side, bench clerk on the left accountant opposite the bench clerk facing west. The King acted as the supreme judge and had the final decision issued under his signature and seal. * Pradvivakas and Sabhyas- assist the king in arriving at the truth and giving correct judgment. * Sabhyas seven, five or three in number‚Äîselected for their knowledge of the law and they had to advise the king on laws applicable to the case. Including only the people well versed in the Vedic lore and civil law. * Bench clerk wrote down the pleading made orally in the case. * Accountant made calculation of money involved in the suits. * Sadhyapala preserved the order in the court, execute its decrees and see to the attendance of parties and witnesses. The decision of a case in ancient India was based on eight sources according to brahmanical law givers. These sources are the three Pramanas (possession, documents, and witnesses) logical inference, the usages of the country, sapathas (oaths and ordeals), the kings edict and admission of the litigants.Kaul:1993. 136-37. If there were cases where no possessions, documents and recourse can be provided the decision of the King became the ultimate authority. Four parts of a trial‚Äî * Pratijna - plaint or complaint * Uttaram ‚Äî answer of written statement * Kriya ‚Äî Trial * Nirnaya ‚Äî Decision according to Yajnavalkya =Ordeals= Ordeals also referred to as Divya were divine methods of proof. They decided what cannot be or is not to be decided by human means of proof. The general rule stated by YƒÅj√±avalkya, Narada, Brahaspati, Katyayana is that ordeals are to be retorted to only if there is no human evidence or circumstantial evidence available.Kaul:1993. 149-155. Different kinds of ordeals are mentioned at different places, Manu gives only two ordeals i.e. holding of fire and plunging in water. Yet YƒÅj√±avalkya and Vishnu give a list of five, namely balance, fire, water, poison, consecrate water. Narada gives seven different types of ordeals, i.e. ordeal by balance, fire, water, poison, libration, rice, hot piece of gold. Though there has been evidence found that shows the practice of only two ordeals i.e. ordeal by rice and ordeal by sacred libation. They show up in the sources from ancient Kashmir. In the final decisions by the King human modes of proof ruled over divine modes of proof. Ordeals were only used in extraordinary circumstances. There are also more restrictions on who can perform what type of ordeal. Ordeals were generally performed in the presence of King, the judge, learned Brahmans and the public. The place and time where the ordeals could be performed also held importance. They were usually administered either at dawn or in the forenoon or sometimes even late at night. Sunday was the preferred day to administer them. They usually took place at places like temple, royal gate, public place where four roads meet and the hall of justice. The chief judge by the order of the King had to conduct all the rites like a sacrificial priest. The chief judge and the Sodhya had to take religious dips, observe a fast and convoke all deities. Four major ordeals * Ordeal of balance (Tula, Dhata)‚Äîmostly given to women, minors and old or disabled people. The person performing the ordeal was twice weighed on a balance. If the person weighed lighter than the previous weight they were considered innocent; if they were heavier the second time they were considered guilty. * Ordeal of fire (Agni)‚ÄîA hot ball of iron had to be carried across a certain distance in the palm of the hand using pipul leaves. If the hand did not end up getting burnt the person was declared innocent. If the hand was burnt the person was found guilty. * Ordeal of water (Salila)‚ÄîThe person had to dive into a river and keep themselves under water, while at the same time an arrow was also shot into the water and was brought back by a fleet runner. If the person stayed under water till that time and no body part was visible then the person was considered innocent. If the person floated back up again before the arrow was retrieved or a body part other than the top of the head became visible the person was found guilty. * Ordeal of Poison (Visa)‚Äîthe person had to take a certain quantity of poison and was monitored for any reactions for a certain time period. If there was no visible effect of the poison the person was considered innocent. Other types of ordeals included ordeals mentioned in the Smrtis like the ordeal of sacred libation in which an image of a deity was washed in holy water and the accused had to drink that water. If within a certain time period a misfortune occurred in his life he was found to be guilty. Ordeal of rice grains, ordeal of heated piece of gold, ordeal by ploughshare, ordeal by lot also existed within various texts. Ordeals played a significant part in the judicial administration of ancient India, even though they were not really rational and couldn‚Äôt really detect guilt. As pointed out in Medhatithi ordeals were like magic and were meant to scare the guilty party and come out with the truth. =Oaths= Oaths are an affirmation of truth which can be liable to punishment for perjury if the statement given turns out to be false. Manu recommended that when human proofs failed Sapatha or oath could be applied in search of the truth.Das:1977. 93-127. According to the Smrti oaths were intended to be used in simple cases, while ordeals were used only in serious cases. A person making an oath was to swear on his near and dear ones. He might touch the head or feet of a Brahman or his wife or his son, or the feet of an image of a deity or take sacred grass or sesamum, silver, gold, earth, fire, water according as the value of the disputed property. The waiting period on the oaths was one, three, five or more days depending on the nature of the accusation. There is a great amount of sanctity attached to Oaths as explained in Manu that if a man swears on an oath falsely even in a small matter will be lost in this world as well as the next.

The area, known as Northern Epirus (ŒíœåœÅŒµŒπŒøœÇ ŒâœÄŒµŒπœÅŒøœÇ) to Greeks and with a substantial Greek population, was taken by the Greek Army from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913). The Protocol of Florence, however, had assigned it to the newly established Albanian state. This decision was rejected by the local Greeks, and as the Greek army withdrew to the new border, an autonomous government was set up at Argyrokastron (, today Gjirokast√´r), under the leadership of Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished local Greek politician and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and with tacit support from Greece. In May, the autonomy was confirmed by the Great Powers with the Protocol of Corfu. The agreement ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local population and provided for self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty. However, it was never implemented because in August the Albanian government collapsed. The Greek Army reoccupied the area in October 1914 following the outbreak of World War I. It was planned that Northern Epirus would be ceded to Greece following the war, but withdrawal of Italian support and Greece's defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign resulted in its final cession to Albania in November 1921.Miller 1966: 543‚Äì44 Background Ethnographic map of Northern Epirus in 1913, presented by Greece at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 =Northern Epirus and the Balkan Wars= In March 1913, during the First Balkan War, the Greek Army entered Ioannina after breaching the Ottoman fortifications at Bizani, and soon afterwards advanced further north.Gregory C. Ference, ed. Chronology of 20th Century Eastern European History. 1994. Himar√´ had already been under Greek control since 5 November 1912, after a local Himariote, Gendarmerie Major Spyros Spyromilios, led a successful uprising that met no initial resistance.Kondis 1976: p. 93 By the end of the war, Greek armed forces controlled most of the historical region of Epirus, from the Ceraunian mountains along the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa in the east.Schurman 1916: \\"During the first war the Greeks had occupied Epirus or southern Albania as far north as a line drawn from a point a little above Khimara on the coast due east toward Lake Presba, so that the cities of Tepeleni and Koritza were included in the Greek area.\\" At the same time, the Albanian independence movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlor√´, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority only in the immediate area of Vlor√´. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durr√´s,Stickney 1924: 51 while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler.Winnifrith 2002: 130 Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks in the south and the Serbs in the north.Miller 1966: 518 The last Ottoman census, conducted in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region. Of the Orthodox population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The rest of the Orthodox community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and were the first to support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.Winnifrith 2002: 130 \\"...in Northern Epirus loyalty to an Albania with a variety of Muslim leaders competing in anarchy cannot have been strong\\". =Delineation of the Greek‚ÄìAlbanian border= alt=A caricature showing a woman defending herself from a monkey, leopard and snake. The woman's right forearm reads Shkod√´r and the left reads Janina. The concept of an independent Albanian state was supported by the Great European Powers, particularly Austro-Hungary and Italy.Schurman 1916: 'This new kingdom was called into being by the voice of the European concert at the demand of Austria-Hungary supported by Italy.' Both powers were seeking to control Albania, which, in the words of Italian Foreign Minister Tommaso Tittoni, would give whichever managed this \\"incontestable supremacy in the Adriatic\\". The Serbian possession of Shkod√´r and the possibility of the Greek border running a few miles south of Vlore was therefore strongly resisted by these states.Chase 2007: 37‚Äì38 In September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to determine the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of Italy and Austro-Hungary insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian, while those of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian, the younger generation was Greek in intellectual outlook, sentiment, and aspirations.Stickney 1924: 38 Under Italian and Austro- Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania.Stickney 1924: 32‚Äì33 \\"In view of the opposition of the part of the Dual monarchy...showed his irrecontiliation.\\" =Protocol of Florence= With the delineation of the exact boundaries of the new state, the region of Northern Epirus was awarded to Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Florence, signed on 17 December 1913. On 21 February 1914, the ambassadors of the Great Powers delivered a note to the Greek government asking for the Greek army's evacuation of the area. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos acceded to this in hopes of a favorable solution to Greece's other outstanding problem: the recognition of Greek sovereignty over the islands of the North Eastern Aegean.Kitromilides 2008: 150‚Äì151Greek ministry of Foreign Affairs. Note of the Great Powers to Greece. It concerned the decision of the Powers to cede irrevocably to Greece all the Aegean islands already occupied by the latter (with the exception of Imbros, Tenedos and Castellorizo) on the date on which Greek troops would evacuate the parts of Northern Epirus awarded to Albania by the Florence Protocol. Reactions =Declaration of Independence= Vasileios and Spyridon as well as local clergy, military personnel and civilians are seen in the front. This turn of events was highly unpopular among the pro-Greek party in the area. The pro-Greek Epirotes felt betrayed by the Greek government, which had done nothing to support them with firearms. Additionally, the gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable Albanian forces to take control of the region. To avert this possibility, the Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.Kondis 1976: 124Schurman 1916: \\"It is little wonder that the Greeks of Epirus feel outraged by the destiny which the European Powers have imposed upon them... Nor is it surprising that since Hellenic armies have evacuated northern Epirus in conformity with the decree of the Great Powers, the inhabitants of the district, all the way from Santi Quaranta to Koritza, are declaring their independence and fighting the Albanians who attempt to bring them under the yoke.\\" Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Epirote statesman from Lunxh√´ri (gr. Lio√∫ntzi) and former Greek foreign minister, took the initiative and discussed the situation with local representatives in a \\"Panepirotic Council\\". Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the AutonomousThe Greek term autonomos can mean either \\"independent\\" or \\"autonomous\\". Republic of Northern Epirus was declared in Gjirokast√´r (gr. Argyr√≥kastron) and a provisional government, with Christakis-Zografos as president, formed to support the state's objectives. Stickney 1924: 42 In his speech on 2 March,Boeckh 1996: 114 Christakis-Zografos stated that the aspirations of the Northern Epirotes had been totally ignored, and that the Great Powers had not only rejected their becoming autonomous within the Albanian state but also refused to give guarantees regarding their fundamental human rights. Zografos concluded his speech by stating that the Northern Epirotes would not accept the destiny the Powers had imposed upon them:Pyrrhus Ruches.

Sarand√´ was one of the first cities that joined the autonomists' movement. The flag of the new state was a variant of the Greek national flag, consisting of a white cross centered upon the blue background surmounted by the imperial Byzantine eagle in black.Ruches 1965: 83 In the following days, Alexandros Karapanos, Zografos' nephew and an MP for Arta,Miller 1966: 519 was installed as foreign minister. Colonel Dimitrios Doulis, a local from Nivice, resigned from his post in the Greek army and joined the provisional government as minister of military affairs. Within a few days, he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5,000 volunteer troops.Boeckh 1996: 115 The local bishop, Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, took office as minister of Religion and Justice. A number of officers of Epirote origin (not exceeding 30), as well as ordinary soldiers, deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries. Soon, armed groups, such as the \\"Sacred Band\\" or Spyromilios' men around Himar√´ (gr. Him√°rra), were formed in order to repel any incursion into the territory claimed by the autonomous government. The first districts to join the autonomist movement outside of Gjirokast√´r were Himar√´, Sarand√´ and P√´rmet.Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996: 68‚Äì69 =Greece's reaction and evacuation= The Greek government was reluctant to overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued to carry out a slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April. Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that the Great Powers and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by the Great Powers in order to secure peace and stability in the area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokast√´r, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Kor√ß√´ (gr. Koryts√°) asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis, followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of Kolonj√´ (gr. Kol√≥nia), Spyridon, proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.Kondis 1976: 127 Armed group of Epirote women. August 1914, Gjirokast√´r region. On March 1, Kontoulis ceded the region to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie, consisting mainly of former deserters of the Ottoman army and under the command of Dutch and Austrian officers. On March 9, the Greek navy blockaded the port of Sarand√´ (gr. √Ågioi Sar√°nda, known also as Santi Quaranta), one of the first cities that had joined the autonomist movement.Stickney 1924: 43 There were also sporadic conflicts between Greek army and Epirote units, with a few casualties on both sides.Ruches 1965: 84‚Äì85 =Negotiations and armed conflicts= Award of Greece for the Northern Epirote struggle. As the Greek army withdrew, armed conflicts broke out between Albanian and Northern Epirote forces. In the regions of Himar√´, Sarand√´, Gjirokast√´r and Delvin√´ (gr. Delv√≠nion), the revolt had been in full force since the first days of the declaration, and the autonomist forces were able to successfully engage the Albanian gendarmerie, as well as Albanian irregular units. However, Zografos, seeing that the Great Powers would not approve the annexation of Northern Epirus to Greece, suggested three possible diplomatic solutions: * full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Albanian prince; * an administrative and cantonal system autonomy; and * direct control and administration by the European Powers. On March 7, Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania, and intense fighting occurred north of Gjirokast√´r, in the region of Cepo, in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus; Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Epirotes. On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, and negotiations reached a deadlock. Meanwhile, Epirote bands entered Erseka and continued on to Frash√´r and Kor√ß√´. At this point, the entire region that had been claimed by the provisional government, with the exception of Kor√ß√´, was under its control. On March 22, a Sacred Band unit from Bilisht reached the outskirts of Kor√ß√´ and joined the local guerillas, and fierce street fighting took place. For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements. The International Control Commission, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time the cease-fire order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Kor√ß√´, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.Ruches 1965: 91 Recognition of autonomy and outbreak of World War I =Protocol of Corfu= Georgios Christakis Zografos, through effective political maneuvers, gained Northern Epirus internationally recognized autonomous status. Negotiations were carried out on the island of Corfu, where on 17 May 1914 Albanian and Epirote representatives signed an agreement known as the Protocol of Corfu. According to its terms, the two provinces of Kor√ß√´ and Gjirokast√´r that constituted Northern Epirus would acquire complete autonomous existence (as a corpus separatum) under the nominal Albanian sovereignty of Prince Wied. The Albanian government had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper-rank officials, taking into account as much as possible the opinion of the local population. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie and the prohibition of military levies from people not indigenous to the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, with the exception of the first three classes. The use of the Greek language was made equal to Albanian in all public affairs. The Ottoman-era privileges of Himar√´ were renewed, and a foreigner was to be appointed as its \\"captain\\" for 10 years.Miller 1966: 520 The execution of and adherence to the Protocol was entrusted to the International Control Commission, as was the organization of public administration and the departments of justice and finance in the region.Stickney 1924: 49 The creation and training of the local gendarmerie was to be conducted by Dutch officers.Boeckh 1996: 116 The agreement of the Protocol was ratified by the representatives of the Great Powers at Athens on 18 June and by the Albanian government on 23 June.Stickney 1924: 50 The Epirote representatives, in an assembly in Delvin√´, gave the final approval to the terms of the Protocol, although the delegates from Himara protested, claiming that union with Greece was the only viable solution.Kondis: 132‚Äì133 On July 8, control of the cities of Tepelen√´ and Kor√ß√´ passed to the provisional government of Northern Epirus. =Instability and disestablishment= After the outbreak of World War I, the situation in Albania became unstable, and political chaos emerged as the country was split into a number of regional governments. As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification,Ruches 1965: 94 and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small-scale armed operations. These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, as well as the possibility that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict. On 27 October, after receiving the approval of the Great Powers,Guy 2007: Greek troops crossed the southern Albanian border at the end of October 1914, officially reoccupying all of southern Albania, exclusive of Vlor√´, and establishing a military administration by 27 October 1914, p. 117. the Greek Army's V Army Corps entered the area for a second time. The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. Aftermath =Greek administration (October 1914 ‚Äì September 1916)= During the Greek administration at the time of the First World War, it had been agreed to by Greece, Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue would be left for the post-war future. In August 1915, Eleftherios Venizelos stated in the Greek parliament that \\"only colossal faults\\" could separate the region from Greece. Upon Venizelos' resignation in December, however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and predetermine the region's future by formally incorporating it into the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives to the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.Stickney 1924: 57- 63 =Italian‚ÄìFrench occupation and Interwar period= Postage stamp issued by the Northern Epirote postal authorities with the state's flag. The politically unstable situation that followed in Greece during the next months, with the National Schism between royalists and Venizelos‚Äô supporters, divided Greece into two states. This situation, according also to the development of the Balkan Front, led Italian forces in Gjirokast√´r to enter the area in September 1916, after gaining the approval of the Triple Entente, and to take over most of Northern Epirus. An exception was Kor√ß√´ which was retaken by French forces from Bulgarian occupation, and turned into the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Kor√ß√´ under the military protection of the French army. After the war's end in 1918, the tendency to reestablish the autonomy of the region continued.Winnifrith 2002: 132 Under the terms of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece, but political developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco- Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921.Kitromilides 2008: 162‚Äì163 In February 1922, the Albanian Parliament approved the Declaration of Minority Rights. However, the Declaration, contrary to the Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokast√´r, Sarand√´ district and 3 villages in Himar√´), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations.Basil Kondis & Eleftheria Manda.

Page 225 The Northern Epirote issue and the autonomy question From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian sources of that time, the Northern Epirote movement was directly supported by the Greek state, with the help of a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania.Ruches 1965: 87 In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentionedNata≈°a Gregoriƒç Contested Spaces and Negotiated Identities in Dhermi/Drimades of Himare/Himara area, Southern Albania, University of Nova Gorica 2008, p. 144. or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer. Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 1997, , p 2. With the ratification of the Protocol of Corfu, the term \\"Northern Epirus\\", the state's common name‚Äîand consequently that of its citizens, \\"Northern Epirotes\\"‚Äîacquired official status. However, after the region's cession to Albania, these terms were considered associated with Greek irredentist action and not granted legal status by the Albanian authorities; anyone making use of them was persecuted as an enemy of the state. The autonomy question remains on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations as part of the Northern Epirote issue.Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996: 73 In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus.It was not until 1925 that Albania's present borders were fixed through the Florence Protocol, the Kingdom of Greece finally abandoning its claims to northern Epirus. ... in, Brad K.

In February 1873 she attracted attention singing the young shepherd in Tannh√§user at La Monnaie (Bruxelles).CARMEN (Archives of La Monnaie) http://carmen.demunt.be/, accessed 29.12.08 Her first performance at the Op√©ra-Comique was in 1873 as Marie in La fille du r√©giment, going on to sing Mozart and Gounod.

The book argues that regardless of race, social economic class will determine how children cultivate skills they will use in the future. In the second edition, Lareau revisits the subjects from the original study a decade later in order to examine the impact of social class on the transition to adulthood. She covers the subjects' awareness of their social class, high school experiences and the effect of organized activities as they went through their adolescent years. She emphasizes the use of concerted cultivation, and natural growth as tools parents in different social and economic classes use in order to raise their children and by continuing her research ten years later she is able to show how these methods of child rearing helped to cultivate the children into the adults they are today. After her initial fieldwork was completed, Lareau returned to the families featured in her book to examine the pathways each of their lives had followed and to determine if her original research conclusions that class influences educational and work outcomes held true. In most cases, they did. The majority of the poorer, working class participants had either dropped out of high school or not attended post-secondary institutions, or if they had, had not completed their courses. Many were working in jobs that did not require a college degree and had already been working full-time for several years, some had children and car payments to support. Some even gave money back to their parents as rent, for example, if they still lived at home. This made them appear older than the middle class participants who generally had less work experience, and the majority of whom had attended college after going through an extensive preparatory process of investigating various institutions and receiving much greater support and involvement of their parents in making their decision, both about the college to attend and the courses to take. The middle class youth were more likely to be in courses that would lead to professional type occupations like business, medicine and law. Lareau found her earlier conclusions remained true: social class and parenting approaches significantly impacted educational and work outcomes. Middle-class families had financial and knowledge resources that working-class families did not, and that was most visible as students worked their way through high school either successfully or not, and even more so when it came time to make decisions about attending college, what institution to attend and what courses to take. Middle-class parents took a different approach to interventions in their children's lives than working-class parents and continued to play this support role and supervise as their children aged whereas working-class parents tended to stop once their children were 16‚Äì18 years old and it was felt they were old enough to make their own decisions. Lareau comments in a lecture captured on YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xq_iCMgP2Q that, \\"their lives had diverged in a profound way.\\" Unequal Childhoods encourages us to better understand the impact social class has on our educational and life choices as such decisions as who we will marry, where we will live and how we find jobs are influenced by social class and the advantages it may or may not bring. Methodology Lareau and her graduate researchers followed these families around in their daily lives. They attended sporting events, spent the night in the family's home, and attended a doctor's visit to observe the differences between the working- and lower-class families, and middle-class families. During her observations, she notices two different parenting styles. In her follow-up with families ten years later, Lareau admits that the ideal study would have involved on-going participant observation, but that was not feasible given the resources and time investment of the families that would have required. Instead, she conducted two hour recorded interviews with each of the twelve children, and had separate interviews with each of the mothers, fathers and siblings that agreed to be interviewed. Some declined. In response to the second edition of the book, critics continue to comment on the limitations of this study given its small sample size, while applying broad theoretical conclusions to North American society. Lareau briefly addresses race factors having an influence on outcomes for youth, but claims the class factors play a more significant role. Parenting styles Annette Lareau distinguishes between two different parenting styles: Concerted Cultivation and the Accomplishment of Natural Growth. Concerted Cultivation: The parenting style, favored by middle-class families, in which parents encourage negotiation and discussion and the questioning of authority, and enroll their children in extensive organized activity participation. This style helps children in middle-class careers, teaches them to question people in authority, develops a large vocabulary, and makes them comfortable in discussions with people of authority. However, it gives the children a sense of entitlement. Accomplishment of Natural Growth: The parenting style, favored by working-class and lower-class families, in which parents issue directives to their children rather than negotiations, encourage the following and trusting of people in authority positions, and do not structure their children's daily activities, but rather let the children play on their own. This method has benefits that prepare the children for a job in the \\"working\\" or \\"poor-class\\" jobs, teaches the children to respect and take the advice of people in authority, and allows the children to become independent at a younger age.

It is one of the most complete and informative abelisaurids yet known, described from a nearly complete and articulated skeleton.  Description  Size of Skorpiovenator compared to a human Restoration The preserved length of the excavated Skorpiovenator skeleton from the premaxilla to the 12th caudal vertebra is . It was estimated to have grown up to in length. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave larger estimations of and .Paul, G.S. (2010) The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 81 In 2016, a similar size to the original estimate at has been estimated. It had short, stubby, near-useless arms, but strong legs with powerful thighs and sturdy shins over which its large body was balanced. = Skull = Skorpiovenator's skull was short, stout and covered in the ridges, furrows, tubercles and bumpy nodules that are scattered over the heads of most abelisaurid theropods. It is craniocaudally short, similar to Carnotaurus, and is shorter and deeper than the skulls of Abelisaurus and Majungasaurus. Notably, the maxilla and lacrimal of Skorpiovenator are wider than in the corresponding bones of the remaining abelisaurids. Skorpiovenator had 19 maxillary teeth, which is more than any other known abelisaurid. The shape of the crowns of the teeth is similar to other abelisaurids, and exhibit enamel wrinkles and marginal serrations.  Discovery and naming  Fossil under preparation The type specimen was described and named by Canale, Scanferla, Agnolin, and Novas in 2009 (though the paper was released as an advanced publication online in 2008). The name Skorpiovenator bustingorryi is derived from the Greek and Latin for \\"scorpion hunter,\\" due to the abundant scorpions present at the dig site, and the specific name honors Manuel Bustingorry, who owned the farm where the specimen was found. The describers have defined a new name Brachyrostra for a clade, to which Skorpiovenator belonged. The type species, Skorpiovenator bustingorryi, is known from a single, nearly complete skeleton (MMCH-PV 48K) missing only sections of the tail and the majority of the forelimbs. The specimen was recovered from the lower part of the Huincul Formation in Patagonia, dating to the late Cenomanian stage, about 95 million years ago. It would have lived alongside other carnivorous dinosaurs such as the carcharodontosaurid Mapusaurus and another abelisaurid, Ilokelesia. The remains are deposited in the Ernesto Bachmann Paleontological Museum of Villa El Choc√≥n, Patagonia, Argentina.  Classification  In 2008, Canale et al. published a phylogenetic analysis focusing on the South American carnotaurines. In their results, they found that all South American forms (including Skorpiovenator) grouped together as a sub-clade of Carnotaurinae, which they named Brachyrostra, meaning \\"short snouts\\". They defined the clade Brachyrostra as \\"all the abelisaurids more closely related to Carnotaurus sastrei than to Majungasaurus crenatissimus.\\"Canale, J.I., Scanferla, C.A., Agnolin, F., and Novas, F.E.

For a long time it was considered unique, but in 1970 a similar star, V1057 Cygni, was discovered, and a number of additional examples have been discovered since then. These stars constitute the FU Orionis class of variable stars, GCVS type FU, often nicknamed FUors. These stars are pre‚Äìmain sequence stars which display an extreme change in magnitude and spectral type.  Stellar System  FU Orionis consists of two components, both surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Both disks were resolved with ALMA. The primary is surrounded by a dust disk with a radius of 11 astronomical units and the secondary disk has a similar inclination and size. The disks are separated by about 250 au. The 12CO emission show a complex kinematic environment and signatures of disk rotation, which are asymmetric. The asymmetry of the disk rotation is explained with interactions of the disks during a stellar flyby. The primary, called FU Orionis north has a mass of 0.6 and accretes 3.8 \\\\times 10^{-5} per year. The primary has an uncertain spectral type and luminosity class. FU Orionis stars do not show strong emission lines during the outburst and have spectral features that resemble F- or G-type supergiants during the maximum. The outer parts of FU Orionis stars produce a K-M supergiant spectrum, which can be observed in the near-infrared. The secondary, called FU Orionis south could be the more massive component in the system with 1.2 and a spectral type of about K5.

History  Darlton Gliding Club was formed during June 2007 by the merging of the former Newark and Notts Gliding Club and the Dukeries Gliding Club when both of these clubs lost use of their airfields. Darlton is now the only gliding club in the county of Nottinghamshire. The Dukeries club had been based at Gamston but when they lost the use of this site they were able to acquire the land at Darlton. Subsequently, the Newark and Notts club lost the use of their airfield at Winthorpe when the adjoining showground did not renew the lease. After a short period of ground-sharing a formal decision was made to merge the two clubs into one and the new Darlton Gliding Club was formed. Initially there were no facilities on site ‚Äì gliders were rigged and derigged each day ‚Äì so the priority was to erect a hangar. A portacabin was also installed to act as a clubhouse. Much work has been put into improving the grass, and it is now able to support year round operations. Club members have since erected a second hangar and the original portacabin has been replaced with a new clubhouse which was officially opened in April 2011. The club gained access to mains electricity on 30 September 2017 to power the clubhouse and hangars.  Operations  The club is run on a non- commercial basis by the members for the members. All non-flying activities are shared on a voluntary basis. The runway is oriented 05/23 (into the prevailing wind) and the area offers good soaring opportunities. Soaring flights have been achieved in every month from February through to November. Most launches take place using a winch however, in late 2014, some members of the club collectively acquired a Eurofox, allowing the ability to Aerotow. Motor glider operations are permissible and a group of members have a Falke motor glider based on the site.  Club Fleet  The fleet in the hangar.

The sex industry (also called the sex trade) consists of businesses that either directly or indirectly provide sex-related products and services or adult entertainment. The industry includes activities involving direct provision of sex-related services, such as prostitution, strip clubs, host and hostess clubs and sex-related pastimes, such as pornography, sex-oriented men's magazines, sex movies, sex toys and fetish and BDSM paraphernalia. Sex channels for television and pre-paid sex movies for video on demand, are part of the sex industry, as are adult movie theaters, sex shops, peep shows, and strip clubs.  Etymology  The origins of the term sex industry are uncertain, but it appears to have arisen in the 1970s. A 1977 report by the Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry (LaMarsh Commission) quoted author Peter McCabe as writing in Argosy: \\"Ten years ago the sex industry did not exist. When people talked of commercial sex they meant Playboy.\\" A 1976 article in The New York Times by columnist Russell Baker claimed that \\"[M]ost of the problems created by New York City's booming sex industry result from the city's reluctance to treat it as an industry\\", arguing why sex shops constituted an \\"industry\\", and should be treated as such by concentrating them in a single neighborhood, suggesting the \\"sex industry\\" was not yet commonly recognized as such.  Prostitution  Prostitution is a main component of the sex industry and may take place in a brothel, at a facility provided by the prostitute, at a client's hotel room, in a parked car, or on the street. Often this is arranged through a pimp or an escort agency. Prostitution involves a prostitute or sex worker providing commercial sexual services to a client. In some cases, the prostitute is at liberty to determine whether she or he will engage in a particular type of sexual activity, but forced prostitution and sexual slavery does exist in some places around the world. Reasons as to why an individual may enter into prostitution are varied. Socialist and radical feminists have cited poverty, oppressive capitalistic processes, and patriarchal societies that marginalizes people based on race and class as reasons for the continued presence of prostitution, as these aspects all work together to maintain oppression. Other reasons include displacement due to conflict and war. Institutionalized racism in the United States has been cited as a reason for the prevalence of sex workers who are Black or other people of color, as this leads to inequality and a lack of access to resources. The legality of prostitution and associated activities (soliciting, brothels, procuring) varies by jurisdiction. Yet even where it is illegal, a thriving underground business usually exists because of high demand and the high income that can be made by pimps, brothel owners, escort agencies, and traffickers. A brothel is a commercial establishment where people may engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, though for legal or cultural reasons they may describe themselves as massage parlors, bars, strip clubs or by some other description. Sex work in a brothel is considered safer than street prostitution. Prostitution and the operation of brothels are legal in some countries, but illegal in others. For instance, there are legal brothels in Nevada, USA, due to the legalization of prostitution in some areas of the state. In countries where prostitution and brothels are legal, brothels may be subject to many and varied restrictions. Forced prostitution is usually illegal as is prostitution by or with minors, though the age may vary. Some countries prohibit particular sex acts. In some countries, brothels are subject to strict planning restrictions and in some cases are confined to designated red-light districts. Some countries prohibit or regulate how brothels advertise their services, or they may prohibit the sale or consumption of alcohol on the premises. In some countries where operating a brothel is legal, some brothel operators may choose to operate illegally. Some men and women may travel away from their home to engage with local prostitutes, in a practice called sex tourism, though the destination pattern tends to differ between them. Male sex tourism can create or augment demand for sex services in the host countries, while female sex tourism tends not to use existing sex facilities. Like tourism in general, sex tourism can make a significant contribution to local economies, especially in popular urban centers. Sex tourism may arise as a result of stringent anti-prostitution laws in a tourist's home country, but can create social problems in the host country. Businesses that offer prostitution services tend to cluster around military bases. The British naval port of Portsmouth had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large red light districts near American military bases in the Philippines. The Monto red-light district of Dublin, one of the largest in Europe, gained most of its custom from the British soldiers stationed in the city; indeed it collapsed after Irish independence was achieved and the soldiers left. The notorious Patpong entertainment district in Bangkok, and the city of Pattaya, Thailand, started as R&R; locations for US troops serving in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. Prostitution is extremely prevalent in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. Due to the longstanding economic instability of many of these nations, increasing numbers of women have been forced to turn towards the sex industry there for work. According to Lin Lim, an International Labour Organization official who directed a study on prostitution in Southeast Asia, \\"it is very likely that women who lose their jobs in manufacturing and other service sectors and whose families rely on their remittances may be driven to enter the sex sector.\\" The sex industry of these countries has consequently grown to become their dominant commercial sector. Conversely, the sex industry in China has been revived by the nation's recent economic success. The nation's liberal economic policies in the early 1980s have been credited with revitalizing the sex industry as rural communities rapidly expand into highly developed urban centers. A typical example of this can be found in the city of Dalian. The city was declared a special economic zone in 1984; by the twenty- first century what had been a small fishing community developed an advanced commercial sector and a correspondingly large sex industry. A large portion of China's sex workers are immigrants from other Asian nations, such as Korea and Japan. In spite of these circumstances, most Asian countries do not have strong policies regarding prostitution. Their governments are challenged in this regard because of the differing contexts that surround prostitution, from voluntary and financially beneficial labor to virtual slavery. The increasing economic prominence of China and Japan have made these issues a global concern. As a result of Southeast Asia's lax policies regarding prostitution, the region has also become a hotbed for sex tourism, with a significant portion of this industry's clients being North American or European. Other participants The sex industry employs millions of people worldwide, mainly women. These range from the sex worker, also called adult service provider (ASP) or adult sex provider, who provides sexual services, to a multitude of support personnel. Sex workers can be prostitutes, call girls, pornographic film actors, pornographic models, sex show performers, erotic dancers, striptease dancers, bikini baristas, telephone sex operators, cybersex operators, or amateur porn stars for online sex sessions and videos. In addition, like any other industry, there are people who work in or service the sex industry as managers, film crews, photographers, website developers and webmasters, sales personnel, book and magazine writers and editors, etc. Some create business models, negotiate trade, make press releases, draw up contracts with other owners, buy and sell content, offer technical support, run servers, billing services, or payroll, organize trade shows and various events, do marketing and sales forecasts, provide human resources, or provide tax services and legal support. Usually, those in management or staff do not have direct dealings with sex workers, instead hiring photographers who have direct contact with the sex workers. Pornography is professionally marketed and sold to adult webmasters for distribution on the Internet. Other members of the sex industry include the hostesses that work in many bars in China. These hostesses are women who are hired by men to sit with them and provide them with company, which entails drinking and making conversation, while the men flirt and make sexual comments. A number of these hostesses also offer sexual services at offsite locations to the men who hire them. Although this is not done by every woman who works as a hostess in the bars of China, the hostesses are all generally labeled as \\"grey women\\". This means that while they are not seen as prostitutes, they are not considered suitable marriage partners for many men. Other woman who are included in the \\"grey women\\" category are the permanent mistresses or \\"second wives\\" that many Chinese businessmen have. The Chinese government makes efforts to keep secret the fact that many of these hostesses are also prostitutes and make up a significant part of the sex industry. They do not want China's image in the rest of the world to become sullied. Hostesses are given a significant degree of freedom to choose whether or not they would like to service a client sexually, although a refusal does sometimes spark conflict.  Pornography  porn actors preparing to shoot a scene for an adult film. Pornography is the explicit portrayal of explicit sexual subject matter for the purposes of sexual arousal and erotic satisfaction. A pornographic model poses for pornographic photographs. A pornographic film actor or porn star performs in pornographic films. In cases where only limited dramatic skills are involved, a performer in pornographic films may be called a pornographic model. Pornography can be provided to the consumer in a variety of media, ranging from books, magazines, postcards, photos, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, or video game. However, when sexual acts are performed for a live audience, by definition it is not pornography, as the term applies to the depiction of the act, rather than the act itself. Thus, portrayals such as sex shows and striptease are not classified as pornography. The first home-PCs capable of network communication prompted the arrival of online services for adults in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The wide-open early days of the World Wide Web quickly snowballed into the dot-com boom, in-part fueled by an incredible global increase in the demand for and consumption of pornography and erotica. Around 2009, the U.S. porn industry's revenue of $10‚Äì15 billion a year was more than the combined revenue of professional sports and live music combined and roughly on par or above Hollywood's box office revenue.Porndemic ‚Äî Sex in the Digital Age (at 6.35), a 2009 documentary by Christopher Sumpton and Robin Benger in association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. There is mixed evidence on the social impact of pornography. Some insights come from meta-analyses synthesizing data from prior research. A 2015 meta-analysis indicated that pornography consumption is correlated with sexual aggression. However, it is unknown if pornography promotes, reduces or has no effect on sexual aggression at an individual level, because this correlation may not be causal. In fact, counter intuitively, pornography has been found to reduce sexual aggression at a societal level. A 2009 review stated that all scientific investigations of increases in the availability of pornography show no change or a decrease in the level of sexual offending. The question of whether pornography consumption affects consumers' happiness was addressed by a 2017 meta-analysis. It concluded that men who consume pornography are less satisfied with some areas of their lives, but pornography consumption does not make a significant difference in other areas, or to the lives of women. Additionally, a sample of Americans revealed in 2017 that those who had viewed pornography were more likely to experience romantic relationship breakup than their non-pornography watching counterparts, and that the effect was more pronounced with men. Use of children While the legality of adult sexual entertainment varies by country, the use of children in the sex industry is illegal nearly everywhere in the world. Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is the \\"sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or kind to the child or a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object\\". CSEC includes the prostitution of children, child pornography, child sex tourism and other forms of transactional sex where a child engages in sexual activities to have key needs fulfilled, such as food, shelter or access to education. It includes forms of transactional sex where the sexual abuse of children is not stopped or reported by household members, due to benefits derived by the household from the perpetrator. CSEC is prevalent in Asia and parts of Latin America. Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico have been identified as the primary countries where the commercial sexual exploitation of children takes place. Certain places around the world are recognized for child sex tourism. Adult entertainment Adult entertainment is entertainment intended to be viewed by adults only, and distinguished from family entertainment. The style of adult entertainment may be ribaldry or bawdry. Any entertainment that normally includes sexual content qualifies as adult entertainment, including sex channels for television and pre-paid sex movies for \\"on demand\\", as well as adult movie theaters, sex shops, and strip clubs. It also includes sex-oriented men's magazines, sex movies, sex toys and fetish and BDSM paraphernalia.  Opposition  The sex industry is very controversial, and many people, organizations and governments have strong moral objections to it, and, as a result, pornography, prostitution, striptease and other similar occupations are illegal in many countries. The term anti-pornography movement is used to describe those who argue that pornography has a variety of harmful effects on society, such as encouragement of human trafficking, desensitization, pedophilia, dehumanization, exploitation, sexual dysfunction, and inability to maintain healthy sexual relationships. =Sociological objections= Dolf Zillmann asserts that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many sociological effects which he characterizes as unfavorable, including a decreased respect for long- term, monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He claims that pornography can \\"potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children\\" and that it depicts sexuality in a way which is not connected to \\"emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities\\".Zillmann, pages 16-17 Additionally, some researchers claim that pornography causes unequivocal harm to society by increasing rates of sexual assault, a line of research which has been critiqued in \\"The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective\\" on external validity grounds, while others claim there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes. =Immigration and sex tourism= Some researchers have claimed that sex workers can benefit from their profession in terms of immigration status. In her essay \\"Selling Sex for Visas: Sex Tourism as a Stepping-Stone to International Migration\\" anthropologist Denise Brennan cited an example of prostitutes in the Dominican Republic resort town of Sos√∫a, where some female prostitutes marry their customers in order to immigrate to other countries and seek a better life. The customers are, however, the ones that hold the power in this situation as they can withhold or revoke the sex worker's visa, either denying them the ability to immigrate or forcing them to return to their country of origin. Some customers see sex workers from other countries as exotic commodities that can be fetishized or exploited. Sex workers are also at risk of judgement from family members and relatives for having been associated with the sex tourism industry. It also must be noted that migrant sex work happens due to globalization. Globalization has produced growth both in sex tourism and in the migration of women to places where the sex industry thrives. =Homophobia in sex work= Recently, LGBTQ+ communities have welcomed the creation of sex work through a homosexual lens. However, there have also been repercussions within this community due to the brutal treatment of the workers. Many producers and proponents of pornography featuring gay actors claim that this work is liberating and offers them a voice in popular media while critics view it as a degradation of the eroticization of inequality and that advocates for this new line of cinema are only creating a new barrier for homosexuals to contend with. = Feminist objections = British feminist and political theorist Carole Pateman, who has condemned the commodification of women caused by the sex industry Feminism is divided on the issue of the sex industry. In her essay \\"What is wrong with prostitution\\", Carole Pateman makes the point that it is literally the objectification of woman. They are making their bodies an object that men can buy for a price. She also makes the point that prostitution and many other sex industries reinforce the idea of male ownership of a woman. On the other hand, some other feminists see the sex industry as empowering women. They could be seen as simply jobs. The woman who is working them are breaking free from social norms that would previously keep their sexuality under wraps as immoral. Based on these arguments, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have criminalized the buying of sexual services, while decriminalizing the selling of sexual services. (In other words, clients and pimps can be prosecuted for moneyed sexual transactions, but not prostitutes). Supporter of this model of legislation claim reduced illegal prostitution and human trafficking in these countries. Opponents dispute these claims. Some feminists, such as Gail Dines, are opposed to pornography, arguing that it is an industry which exploits women and which is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they charge that abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography are rampant) and in its consumption (where they charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They charge that pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism. However, other feminists are opposed to censorship, and have argued against the introduction of anti-porn legislation in the United States‚Äîamong them Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, Karen DeCrow, Wendy Kaminer and Jamaica Kincaid. = Other objections = The sex industry often raises criticism because it is sometimes connected to criminal activities such as human trafficking, illegal immigration, drug abuse, and exploitation of children (child pornography, child prostitution). The sex industry also raises concerns about the spread of STDs.

He was also a member of the Pasadena City Council from 1987 to 1999, and a Green Party candidate for Congress in 2006. He was the first Armenian-American mayor of Pasadena, as well as the only Pasadena mayor to visit Cuba during his term. Paparian has been known throughout his political career as an outspoken advocate of controversial causes, including ending the trade embargo against Cuba. He attracted national media attention for dispatching a Pasadena police helicopter to issue a citation to state aircraft spraying pesticides over the city, and for his urging Rose Parade observers in 2008 to turn their backs on the Chinese float, which he called the \\"Beijing Float of Shame.\\" Early years Paparian was raised in the Sherman Oaks section of the San Fernando Valley in the 1960s. He is the son of an Armenian immigrant mother and second generation Armenian-Irish-American father from Rhode Island. Paparian received his B.A. degree from California State University Northridge and later received his J.D. degree from Southwestern University School of Law. While attending California State University Northridge, he was a theater student who also protested the Vietnam War. Yet, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1971 and was stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County during the final years of the war. Years later, as Mayor of Pasadena, he was awarded the Outstanding Military Volunteer Service Medal by the Secretary of the Navy for his efforts as an elected public official on behalf of the military and veterans. After being discharged from the Marine Corps, Paparian attended Southwestern University School of Law on the G.I. Bill and became an attorney. As a young attorney, he helped gain a medical furlough for Gourgen Yanikian, an Armenian immigrant convicted in the 1973 assassination of two Turkish diplomats, and defended Harry M. Sassounian, a Pasadena man found guilty in the fatal 1982 shooting of a Turkish consul. He first achieved notoriety in 1987, when he unexpectedly unseated former Mayor Jo Heckman for her seat on the Board of City Directors, when her reelection was considered to be a safe bet. Reputation for independence Paparian has been known throughout his political career for a \\"go-it-alone\\" streak. In 1997, the Los Angeles Times published a profile of Paparian, focusing on his independence and penchant for attracting controversy. The Times noted > To detractors, his antics have undercut some otherwise good works and tarred > Pasadena's stately image. The controversies also have underlined the > sometimes puzzling complexities of a former Republican (now an independent) > who admires both leftist revolutionary Che Guevara and the U.S. Marine > Corps, who speaks out on Cuba and for the rights of American gun owners like > himself. Paparian's views may seem an incongruous marriage of right and > left, but his friends say they mark an independent-minded populist who > favors the underdog and answers no clarion but his own. Paparian suggested that his advocacy for unpopular causes was the product of \\"an intolerance for intolerance\\" and his upbringing in a family of Armenian immigrants. Cuban relations Paparian known for his efforts to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. As Mayor of Pasadena, he convened a conference on U.S.-Cuba relations at Occidental College that was co-sponsored by the United Nations Association and the Department of Diplomacy and World Affairs. Paparian has traveled frequently to Cuba to coordinate the delivery of medical supplies and equipment and has worked with the Cuban Council of Churches and Havana's pediatric hospitals. In July 1996, Paparian visited Cuba with his family in a trip paid for by the Cuban government. Paparian \\"received accolades and applause\\" in Cuba for his urging the U.S. government to end the trade embargo against Cuba. However, his visit led to criticism back in Pasadena. Upon his return from Cuba, more than 300 people crowded into a City Council meeting, some supporting and others opposing Paparian's trip. Criticism of China Paparian has also been an outspoken critic of the People's Republic of China. In July 1996, Mayor Paparian welcomed the Dalai Lama to City Hall and presented him with a key to the city, ignoring concerns expressed by the State Department and the government of the People's Republic of China, that there could be dire consequences for the relationship between the United States and China. In December 2007, when Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard referred to China's human rights abuses in China \\"allegations,\\" and invited China to enter a float in Pasadena's annual Rose Parade, Paparian wrote an article in the Pasadena Weekly urging parade observers to \\"Turn your backs on Bogaard's Beijing Float of Shame!\\" Armenian activism As an Armenian-American, Paparian has also spoken out about the Armenian Genocide. In April 1996, he was the keynote speaker at a ceremony attended by Elizabeth Dole and 7,000 others, remembering the genocide; the ceremony was held at the Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello, California. In his keynote address, Paparian noted: \\"Every year, we come to this hallowed site to honor the memory of our 1.5 million martyrs. Armenians the world over do the same on this day, each and every Armenian honoring our collective loss. But, we also know that the Genocide is not over. It continues silently, relentlessly, insidiously. The scars are not healed. The wounds are still festering, and the suffering is real.\\" In 1989, Paparian led the effort to declare Vanadzor, Pasadena's fourth Sister City. When a Genocide Resolution was defeated in the U.S. Congress in 2007, Paparian called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi under the Freedom of Information Act to release all records regarding the Genocide Resolution including records of meetings with representatives of the Turkish government. Paparian noted, \\"For too long, the leadership of the Democratic Party has played the Armenian-American community on recognition of the Armenian Genocide of 1915.\\" Other issues In what the Los Angeles Times called \\"one of his best-known moments,\\" Paparian led Pasadena's opposition to the state's use of helicopters to spray pesticides to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly. Paparian received national media attention when he passed an ordiance outlawing formation-flying at low altitudes, and dispatched a Pasadena police helicopter to issue a citation to the state's pesticide-spraying aircraft. In 1996, Paparian, then serving as Pasadena's Mayor, drew fire over a fund-raising \\"smoker\\" he hosted on the Rose Bowl's turf. Participants paid $110 each to smoke cigars with the Mayor, drawing criticism from anti-smoking advocates. In 1997, Paparian became engaged in a legal battle with the Pasadena Star News. The paper published a front-page story on Paparian's personal financial troubles on the day of the 1996 UCLA-USC football game. Paparian sued the paper, charging that the reporter had used confidential credit records in an effort to embarrass him. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 1997. Paparian has also been an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War and, in 2006, called on the California legislature to support and pass AJR 39, a California resolution calling for impeachment proceedings against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

The property, acquired in 1993 by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations, is named for a natural rock shelter once used as a winter camp by Native Americans. Its location near two, long Native American footpaths suggests that it may also have been a trail camp and meeting place. The Rock House Reservation is located off Massachusetts Route 9 and offers of hiking trails, an interpretive center, a butterfly garden, and scenic vistas. Boulder strewn Carter Pond occupies the center of the property. The reservation is open to hiking, picnicking, and cross country skiing. Horseback riding and mountain biking are allowed on certain parts of the property. History During the last ice age when the southern movement of the Wisconsin Glacier transformed the landscape producing unique rock formations and outcroppings. Today two glacially formed outcroppings are still present on the property. These formations are known as Balance Rock and the Rock House Shelter. After the ice age, archaeologists believe Native Americans used the Rock House Shelter as a winter camp, trail camp and/or meeting place. In the mid 17th century, the forests of West Brookfield were cleared by colonists for farming. In 1866, pastures around the Rock House were added to a 281-acre farm on Ragged Hill Road owned by William Adams whose family would tend the land for more than 125 years. During the first two decades of the 20th Century, Rock House was a popular stop on the \\"Copper Line\\", an electric trolley that ran between West Brookfield and Ware. Visitors came to picnic in the abandoned pastures and explore this historic Native American landmark. Later the area was used as a country retreat by Arthur Carter, a family descendant of the Adams who owned the land since the mid-1800s. Arthur built a small cabin in 1930, today‚Äôs Trailside Museum, and created Carter Pond by building an earthen dam. The property was gifted to The Trustees of Reservations in 1993. It is located next to the birthplace of suffragist Lucy Stone. Ownership History The Rock House Reservation was an anonymous gift, with endowment, in 1993 in memory of William Adams. Additional land was then purchased in 2002. The Rock House Reservation began with the gift of a conservation restriction to The Trustees of Reservations by an anonymous donor in 1977 followed by a donation of the fee interest in 1993, in memory of William Adams. The reservation was expanded by 58 acres in 2002 with the addition of 50 acres on the Reservation‚Äôs western border, which had been acquired from John Cregan and Donald Richards, and an additional 8 acres, west of the Cregan and Richards parcel, from Maurice Labbe. Natural Resources The Rock House reservation is located in the Lower Worcester Plateau/Eastern Connecticut Upland Ecoregion. Elevations at the Rock House range between 600 feet near its lowest elevation to more than 1,020 feet at its highest which makes up nearly the full range of elevation for the ecoregion. Rock outcrops and large surface boulders are common, and most are covered with lichens and ferns. The outcrop that gives the Reservation its name is among the largest and most dramatic. Post agricultural second-growth mixed forest and conifer plantations cover much of the eastern half of the Reservation while an oak dominated forest, possibly containing primary forest, covers the western half. Carter‚Äôs Pond is a primary scenic feature near the center of the property. The two and a half acre pond is very shallow and was created in the 1920s or 1930s. A power line also bisects the Reservation creating early successional habitat. Several intermittent streams flow through the property, flowing south towards Route 9 and the Ware River. Woodland vernal pools are uncommon. Carter Pond Carter Pond is a relatively shallow pond, with an area of about 2.5 acres and a watershed of about 8 acres. The pond has a healthy riparian zone (characterized by woody trees and shrubs) and healthy shoreline vegetation (characterized by sedges, grasses, rushes). Both of these areas provide important habitat for dragonflies, damselflies, mammals and amphibians. The pond has an average depth of 1 meter and soft substrate that is characterized by inorganic sediment and undecomposed organic matter. Sunlight reaches the bottom of the substrate 40% of the time. The pond has a healthy pH and alkalinity, low levels of nitrates, phosphates and dissolved oxygen and high levels of suspended solids. Biologically, there is a high diversity of macroinvertebrate and fish populations but a low diversity and of submerged and floating aquatic plants. It is unusual that Carter Pond has a low diversity of submerged aquatic plants, because shallow ponds usually have plants growing from shore to shore. In the case of Carter Pond, plant growth and reproduction might be limited by low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrient deficiencies may be caused by the pond‚Äôs small pond-to- watershed ratio and/or lack of nutrient inflow from an upstream source. In addition, it is possible that the spring that feeds Carter Pond is nutrient- poor, although additional water quality testing will be needed to confirm or disprove this theory. Carter Pond‚Äôs low abundance of aquatic plants may be contributing to another problem the pond is experiencing: low dissolved oxygen. This is because dissolved oxygen often enters the water as a byproduct of aquatic-plant photosynthesis. Thus, low numbers of aquatic plants can limit the amount of dissolved oxygen that enters the water. Lack of aeration due to stagnant water and/or warm water temperatures could also contribute to the low levels of dissolved oxygen in Carter Pond. Carter Pond is also experiencing high levels of inorganic sediment in the water column. A visual observation of sediment deposition on the north bank suggests that sediment might be eroding into the pond from the north shore after heavy rains. This deposition could be a problem because it limits transparency, decreases benthic habitat diversity, and builds up on the bottom of the pond. Carter Pond is also dealing with a build-up of organic matter, such as leaves and sticks, on the bottom of the pond. It is currently unclear why this accumulation is greater than decay, but it could be a result of low pond turnover rates, low numbers of decomposer in the benthic environments, or low dissolved oxygen Threats to Natural Resources Erosion poses a major threat to this property along many of the trail. One of the trails most affected is the Fire Road, which is prone to erosion, which causes sediment to be deposited into Carter Pond. These deposits cause the siltation of the pond due which is impacts the aquatic ecosystem and could result in the eventual filling in of the pond. Recent repairs have helped to address erosion but anticipated impacts from climate change will make erosion on ongoing issue. Trail erosion is likely to increase because of recent intense thunder and rain storms, which have increased erosion. Invasive plants are present but control efforts funded by the Landowner Incentive Program (LIP) over the past few years have helped control these species to the point that routine management should address future control needs. Knapweed is spreading along the power lines. Deer also pose a threat to the natural resources at the reservation. When deer numbers are high, browsing pressures can impact forest regeneration and plant species composition. Current browsing pressures at Rock House do not appear to be obvious which could be due to surrounding lands and part of the Reservation which have been open to hunting. Recreation The property is open year round, sunrise to sunset, for hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and hunting (in season). Hunting is only permitted on the part of the property which lies west of the Outer Loop. Fishing is strictly prohibited. Dogs are allowed, but must be kept under voice control or on a leash. Mountain Bikes and Horseback Riders are permitted on the fire road only. The reservation offers more than 3 miles of trails and throughout the property and has moderate hiking which can be strenuous in places. References *Rock House Reservation.

EACEF is student-staffed and operates as a fully independent 501(c)3 public charity. EACEF seeks to improve educational environments in East Africa by constructing school buildings and implementing learning programs. Having raised in excess of $250,000 dollars, EACEF is the largest independent student-run nonprofit organization in the United States.  Mission statement  EACEF exists to create and promote educational opportunity for academically gifted, economically disadvantaged children in East Africa.  About  Originally focused in Central Province, Kenya, EACEF has now expanded into Western Uganda. In both countries, EACEF engages in programs ranging from the promotion of English-language literacy to the development of inter-community relations. EACEF strives to create environments conducive to learning in every aspect of its outreach: through implementing the Nafasi Process, infrastructure initiatives such as the construction of fully equipped classrooms, libraries, kitchens, and latrines help to accommodate the everyday necessities of the students. Programs tailored to the needs of the students and teachers alike were also designed to ensure the efficient use of the new buildings. EACEF instills academic encouragement in communities that face educational hardships and believes that the first step to prosperity is proper schooling. The Kirimara Project represents the first trial run of the Nafasi Process. Astounding improvements were achieved in both the lives of the students and their performance in the classroom through the unique combination of infrastructure improvements and enhancement programs. The Chania Project seeks to replicate the successes achieved at Kilimara under the Nafasi Process. Located in Nyeri, Kenya, the school serves the children of destitute migrant laborers and squatters. The Shalom Project is EACEF‚Äôs first venture into Uganda. The school will serve a population long neglected in the wartorn region of Western Uganda.  Founding story  EACEF grew out of a realization on the part of its founder, Andrew Sugrue. In March 2007, he traveled to Kenya on an endowed exchange program through The Westminster Schools of Atlanta.http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/printedition/2008/05/08/kenya.html?cxntlid=inform_artr Traveling throughout the country, Sugrue visited schools where libraries consisted of a single shelf with four or five books under a leaky roof. In contrast, the children who called these makeshift quarters their schools often exhibited academic potential and, given the chance, could greatly benefit from a decent education. Sadly, the Kenyan education system allows only the top fifth of school-age children to advance to high school; only those who receive the highest marks on the English-language KCPE exam are admitted. Many children living in rural communities unfortunately do not have the materials necessary to learn English, leaving them incapable of passing an exam in a foreign language. Inspired, Sugrue returned home with the dream of addressing these inadequacies. With the help of visionaries like Scott Hawkins of the Mount Kenya Academy (MKA) Foundation, Kemi Nix of Children's Literature for Children, and Charity Mwangi, the Founder and Director of MKA, EACEF took form. Based on its mission of promoting opportunity through education, EACEF seeks to ensure that every student has the chance to live up to their potential. By providing educational support from furnished classrooms to school meals, rural children in East Africa will have the opportunity to go on to high school and to college. EACEF continues to grow with its first project at Kilimara Primary School outside of Nyeri, Kenya, now completed. EACEF intends to extend this successful design through itsnewly developed program, the Nafasi Process.

Other names for this flow regime are intermediate or slip flow, since it represents a transition state between free molecular flow and viscous flow. Thus the flow of fluids under Knudsen flow conditions is established both by molecular phenomena and by the viscosity. Separation processes For a gas passing through small holes in a thin wall in the Knudsen-flow regime, the number of molecules that pass through a hole is proportional to the pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to its molecular mass. It is therefore possible to effect a partial separation of a mixture of gases if the components have different molecular masses. The technique is used to separate isotopic mixtures, such as uranium, using gaseous diffusion through porous membranes. It has also been successfully demonstrated for use in hydrogen production, as a technique for separating hydrogen from the gaseous product mixture created when water is heated at high temperatures using solar or other energy sources.

Historical background The Norr≈ìnna Society was founded around 1896 as \\"a federation of Anglo-Nordic men of letters\\",The American Register, Vol. 5, Issue 7, 1930. by King Oscar II of Norway and Sweden for the purpose of ‚Äúresurrecting, reproducing, collecting and collating or indexing every thing that pertained to the early history of the Anglo Saxon, Celtic, Teutonic, and Scandinavian races‚Äîto furnish the people of Northern Europe with their own vital history.‚Äù Johnston, Harold D., The International Anglo-Saxon Society; Its History and Purpose in The Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society, Vol. 6, 1908, pp. 119‚Äì121.

In Great Britain, where the name of the society was changed to the Anglo-Saxon Society, membership reached 30,000. Upon expanding into America, the name was again changed to The International Anglo-Saxon Society. At that stage, the society began issuing elaborate, official certificates of membership. According to surviving examples, known members included Dr. Johnathan Ackerman Coles (1843‚Äì1926) of Newark, New JerseyWho's Who in the World, 1912, p. 298 and Edward Francis Wehrle (1868‚Äì1941) of Los Angeles, California.

The majority of the editions contain a frontispiece stating that the volumes were ‚Äúprivately printed for members,‚Äù and a \\"certificate of membership\\" was bound into the first volume at least one known set. The most common criticism of these editions is the fact that they were considered inexpensive or abridged reprints of earlier works with little new added to the content. Still many collectors held these sets, many finely bound, in high regard. In a letter to Anderson, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt stated that he kept his set in the most valued part of his library.

An accomplished trial attorney who has continued trying cases after being elected county attorney, Gaertner was inducted in the elite American College of Trial Lawyers in 2009. 2010 gubernatorial run In 2009, Gaertner announced her candidacy for governor as a Democrat, citing her experience as a prosecutor in Ramsey County. Gaertner initially indicated she would not seek party endorsement, but would instead run in the DFL primary in August 2010. Due to pressure from the local community that criticized her over-zealous prosecution and labeling of eight protesters as \\"domestic terrorists\\" during the RNC 2008 convention, Gaertner announced that she would withdraw from the race.Susan Gaertner drops out of governor race Koua Fong Lee trial and aftermath In the summer of 2010, prisoner Koua Fong Lee was released from prison after a retrial was ordered in manslaughter convictions in the crash involving his Toyota vehicle which killed three people. Susan Gaertner, who had consistently opposed his release (even after over 100 people had died in crashes related defective Toyotas), offered to release Lee from prison on the condition that he admit to guilt and register as a convicted felon, this during final deliberations of the appeals court deciding on his right to retrial. Immediately upon the court overturning his conviction and ordering a retrial, Gaertner announced she would not be pursuing another case against him; raising questions in the legal community and in the press about her judicial judgement for inexplicably flipping positions ex post facto. Two months later, Gaertner announced she would not be seeking re-election.

Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in,Koenen, Klaus. (2004) Bethel: Geschichte, Kult and Theologie abbreviated from Birket Beni Isra√¨l (trans. Pool of the Children of Israel) was a public cistern located on the north- eastern corner of the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. The structure is believed to have been built by the Romans for use as a water reservoir and also to protect the northern wall of the Temple Mount. Arab locals have known it by this name since at least 1857.Hackett (1857), p. 186 By the mid-19th century it had gone out of use as a reservoir; being partly filled with rubbish and reused as a vegetable garden. In 1934 it was filled in and is now known as el-Ghazali Square. It is currently in mixed use for shops, as a car park, and as a transshipment point for refuse. Construction Birket Israel, circled, on a 1915 map According to Muslim tradition, the reservoir was constructed by Ezekiel or Hezekiah, King of Judah.Hanauer (2008), p. 104 Some archaeologists have determined that the cistern was possibly built during the Herodian period to improve Jerusalem's water supply.From Pompey to the Destruction of the Second Temple Others estimate the date of construction later, in around 130 CE. This view is held by Charles Warren who recorded that although some kind of fosse must have existed at the spot at a very early period, since there is no description of the pool in the works of Josephus, \\"and it is very improbable that he would have omitted to mention so enormous a reservoir had it existed in his time\\", it was most probably constructed by Roman emperor Hadrian during his restoration of Jerusalem. This is further attested to since the masonry of the birket is inferior in character and resembles the later Roman work in Syria. Additionally, this reservoir appears to be mentioned by the Bordeaux Pilgrim (section 4) as already existing, and \\"would therefore most naturally be referable to Hadrian.\\"Warren, Charles. Conder, Claude Reigner. The Survey of Western Palestine, Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund, London, 1884. It was constructed in the bed of the western fork of the Kidron Valley that traverses the north-west quarter of the city.Paton [1908] (1977), p. 35 It formed Jerusalem's largest reservoir, measuring by with a maximum depth of .Finkelstein, Horbury, Davies & Sturdy (1999), p. 10 The cistern contained a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters and for centuries it formed part of Jerusalem's rainwater storage system. The pool also served as a moat, protecting the northern wall of the Temple Mount.Response to Other Theories The eastern and western ends of the pool were partially rock-cut and partly masonry. The masonry at the eastern end formed a great dam thick, the lower part of which was continuous with an ancient eastern wall of the Temple compound. The sides of the pool were lined entirely with masonry because it was built across the width of a valley. The original bottom of the reservoir was covered with a layer of about 19 inches of very hard Roman concrete and cement. There was a great conduit at the eastern end of the pool built of massive stones, and connected with the pool by a perforated stone with three round holes 5¬Ω inches in diameter. The position of this outlet shows that all water over a depth of must have flowed away.International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia (1913) Association with the Pool of Bethesda Labeled as \\"The Pool of Bethesda\\" in the 1842-49 The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia The Birket Israel cistern was frequented by Christian pilgrims during the 19th century, it being previously identified as the \\"Sheep Pool\\" or Pool of Bethesda of John 5:2; a double-pool with five porches, where the sick came to be cured.Kopp (1963), Pages 305-313. This link was based on the premise that the nearby St. Stephen's Gate occupied the site of the Sheep Gate mentioned in the New Testament. It was reinforced by the co-location of the names 'Birket Israel' and the 'Pool of Bethesda' on maps and plans of Jerusalem; and in drawings and paintings, such as those made by David Roberts in 1893.Schuler, Wolfgang (1991). In the Holy Land: Paintings by David Roberts 1839. Bnei Brak, Israel: Steimatzky ltd. What appears to be Birket Israel is described as: \\"Jerusalem, Bethesda Pool between the Temple Mount (left) and St. Anna\\". According to Kopp, the Pool of Bethesda became associated with a Byzantine church by 450 CE; then a 6th-century church, which by the arrival of the Crusaders, in 1099, was known as the \\"Church of St. Anne\\". A new Church of St. Anne was built in the 12th century CE; the church and the pool fell into disuse after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The church was converted into madrasah and Christian pilgrims were redirected to nearby Birket Israel on the other side of what is now called the \\"Via Dolorosa\\". Ownership of the whole site of the Church of St. Anne passed to France after the Crimean War, in 1856; and discoveries made in around 1870 led to the belief that the real Pool of Bethesda was actually located in the grounds of the Church of St. Anne.Wallace [1898] (1977), p. 225 Later uses By the mid-19th century, Birket Israel was no longer being used as a reservoir; and towards the end of the 19th century it was being rapidly filled with refuse and part of it was being used as a vegetable garden.Wallace [1898] (1977), p. 240 In 1934 the pool was filled in because its condition posed a threat to public health.Safdie, Barton, & Shetrit (1986), p. 115 Being located just inside the Lions' Gate, one of the major entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company initially intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work at the base of the Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Jerusalem and the Implementation of 21 C/Resolution 4/14, 31 May 1983 Today the area is known as el-Ghazali Square and is used as a car park and collection point for refuse before it is dumped outside the city. Some small shops also exist at the site. See also * Pool of Bethesda * Pool of Siloam References Bibliography *Finkelstein, Louis; Horbury, William; Davies, William David; Sturdy, John.

The excellent tracking skills of these Aboriginal Australians were advantageous to settlers in finding food and water and locating missing persons, capturing bushrangers and violently \\"dispersing\\" other groups of Indigenous peoples. The first recorded deployment of Aboriginal trackers by Europeans in Australia was in 1791 when Watkin Tench utilised Eora men Colbee and Balloderry to find a way to the Hawkesbury River. In 1795, an aboriginal guide led Henry Hacking to the Cowpastures area where the lost First Fleet cattle were found. In 1802, Dharawal men Gogy, Budbury and Le Tonsure with Gandangara men Wooglemai and Bungin assisted Ensign Francis Barrallier in his explorations into the Blue Mountains. There are many other examples of explorers, squatters, military/paramilitary groups, naval missions, and police utilising Aboriginal assistance in tracking down wanted persons. For instance, in 1834, near Fremantle, Western Australia, two trackers named Mogo and Mollydobbin tracked a missing five-year-old boy for more than ten hours through rough Australian bush. Another notable event occurred in 1864 when Duff children Jane (7), Isaac (9) and Frank (4) Duff, lost for nine days in Wimmera, were found by Aboriginal tracker Dick-a-Dick. Tracking When asked how he tracked, Mitamirri, a famous tracker of the early 20th century, said \\"I never bend down low, just walk slow round and round until I see more.\\"Edgar, S. (1996) \\"James, Jimmy [Mitamirri] (1902? - 1945)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, Parkville. In 1845 Edward Stone Parker the Assistant Protector of Aborigines in Victoria, based at the Loddon Aboriginal Protectorate Station at Franklinford, wrote a letter to the Chief Protector reporting on the murder of 'a native' at Joyce's Station (near Newstead). No witness to the murder could be found but footprints of five men were tracked by the Jajowurrong to open country south of Mount Macedon (Sunbury region). The trackers there met with another man attached to the Loddon Protectorate Station who was on his return from Melbourne. He told the trackers he had met with the group they were tracking and was able to give a description of them. The New South Wales Police Force actively engaged Aboriginal trackers from 1850, attempting to secure Aboriginal trackers for each of the police districts. By 1867, 52 Aboriginal Trackers were in the employ of the police at a daily rate of 2s 6d (approximately per month).NSW State Archives, NRS 10946, Police salary registers In that year, at the height of bushranger activity in the Goulburn Police District, three mounted Aboriginal trackers of the New South Wales Police Force were actively involved in the capture of the Clarke brothers at Jinden near Braidwood. Aboriginal tracker Sir Watkin Wynne (later Sergeant Major Sir Watkin Wynne), led the initial party of police from Fairfield under the command of Senior Constable Wright (later Sub-inspector Wright) to their location at Jinden. He was seriously injured during the capture and had an arm amputated. He was awarded for his role in the capture. Two other trackers, who subsequently led other police to the scene, trackers George Emmott (stationed at Ballalaba) and Thomas (stationed at Major's Creek), secured lesser awards of . Tracker George Emmott had previously received an award of for the arrest of Pat Connell another member of the gang.Martin Brennan's handwritten Police History of Notorious Bushrangers held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney, NSW - A2030 pp270-322, transcribed at http://grafton.nsw.free.fr/mother/pdfs/Brennan.pdf Two members of the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force, Wannamutta and Werannabe, assisted in the capture of Ned Kelly at Glenrowan, Victoria in 1880. They had been promised reward for Kelly's capture but descendants claimed the two were never paid.Koori Mail, \\"Tracker descendants to appeal back-pay ruling\\", 24 September 1997, p. 2. Native Police Members of the Queensland Native Police who assisted in the search of bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang A number of Native Police organisations were established in Australia during the 19th Century employing armed and mounted Aboriginal trackers under white officers to carry out various duties, the foremost of these being punitive missions against Aboriginal peoples who resisted colonialisation. During the goldrush era, they were also used to patrol goldfields and search for escaped prisoners. They were provided with uniforms, firearms, food rations and a dubious salary. A contingent of Queensland Police trackers were sent to Victoria to help in the hunt for the Kelly Gang in 1879. The trackers along with Queensland and Victorian police officers pose in Benalla Police Paddock. Back Row L-R: Senior Constable Tom King (Standing); Troopers Jimmy, Hero and Barney and Victorian Police Superintendent J Sadlier. Front Row L-R: Queensland Sub-Inspector Stanhope O‚ÄôConnor, Troopers Johnny and Jack and Victoria Police Commissioner, Captain Frederick Charles Standish (hands in pockets) In 1879 the services of a group of Queensland Aboriginal police were requested to help track the Kelly gang which were on the run from the Victorian police. Their use was agreed and a party of six \\"native\\" troopers, with a white officer (Sub-Inspector Stanhope O'Conner) reached Benalla about March 1879. Recent and present day use In 1941, the Northern Territory Special Reconnaissance Unit was established to patrol the north Australia coastline for Japanese landings and infiltration, and was primarily composed of Aboriginal soldiers. The 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit (\\"Nackaroos\\") performed a similar role, though Aboriginal people were a minority in the unit, serving as labourers and trackers. In the present day Australian Army, the Regional Force Surveillance Units can be seen as a spiritual descendant of the tracker legacy. Aboriginal trackers within the Queensland police force wore yellow epaulets to denote their role. Australia's last Aboriginal police tracker employed solely for the role, Lama Lama elder Barry Port, retired in 2014 with no replacement. Port died at Coen on the Cape York Peninsula on 4 March 2020. He had spent 30 years as a tracker, and the public bar at Coen was named after him.

Foster (November 19, 1934 ‚Äì October 31, 1990) was an American LGBT rights and Democratic activist. Foster became active in the early gay rights movement when he moved to San Francisco following his undesirable discharge from the United States Army in 1959 for being homosexual.Shilts (1993), p. 168 Foster co-founded the Society for Individual Rights (SIR), an early homophile organization, in 1964. Dianne Feinstein credits SIR and the gay vote with generating her margin of victory in her election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969.Armstrong, p. 125 In 1971, Foster, along with Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, transformed the SIR Political Action Committee into the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club.Armstrong, p. 126 The Toklas club was the first gay Democratic club in country. Also in 1971, Foster was instrumental in convincing Richard Hongisto to run for sheriff and in delivering gay votes to his winning campaign. It became a truism of San Francisco politics that, as long-time activist Jos√© Sarria had put it, \\"nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community.\\"Lockhart p. 36 In 1972, after the Toklas club delivered one-third of the signatures needed to secure George McGovern the first position on the California Democratic primary ballot, Foster was added to the list of speakers at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Originally, Foster had been given a prime time speaking slot, but George McGovern's campaign manager, future U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Gary Hart, changed it to a 3:00 a.m. speaking slot. The campaign had decided they needed to tone down their radical image.Shilts (1993), p. 169 He and fellow delegate Madeline Davis were the first openly LGBT people ever to address a national party convention.Bianco, p. 318 He called upon the Democratic Party to add a gay rights plank to the party platform,Ridinger, p. 176 saying: > We do not come to you begging your understanding or pleading your tolerance. > We come to you affirming our pride in our lifestyle, affirming the validity > of our right to seek and to maintain meaningful emotional relationships and > affirming our right to participate in the life of this country on an equal > basis with every citizen. Foster and other gay rights activists got a minority report to the floor, but the plank was defeated.Endean, et al., p. 59 Foster was approached by fledgling gay politician Harvey Milk in 1973. Milk sought Foster's endorsement for his first campaign for Supervisor. Foster, who through the Toklas club had staked out a position that it was best for the gay community to work with liberal establishment politicians than try to elect gay candidates, refused to support Milk's campaign.Shilts (1982), p. 74 This led to an enmity between the men which lasted until Milk's assassination in 1978. It has been suggested that this enmity, which extended to the Toklas club and the Milk-founded San Francisco Gay Democratic Club, may have hampered the LGBT community's early efforts to address the spread of HIV in San Francisco.Shilts (1987), p. 280 Foster was a founding member of the San Francisco Health Commission in 1985.Shilts (1987), p. 523 In 1989 he was hired by pharmaceutical company Lymphomed as a consultant. Foster died of an AIDS-related illness at his San Francisco home on October 31, 1990. See also * Sexual orientation and the United States military Notes References * Armstrong, Elizabeth A. (2002).

There has since developed no particular \\"Canadian\\" school of philosophy. Rather, Canadian philosophers have reflected particular views of established European and later American schools of philosophical thought, be it Thomism, Objective Idealism, or Scottish Common Sense Realism. Since the mid-twentieth century the depth and scope of philosophical activity in Canada has increased dramatically. This article focuses on the evolution of epistemology, logic, the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, ethics and metaethics, and continental philosophy in Canada.  1700s-1900s  = The Roman Catholic Church and philosophy = The Roman Catholic Church, one of the founding institutions of New France, had a profound influence on philosophy in Canada. As early as 1665, philosophy, viewed as the handmaiden of theology, was taught in Quebec at the Jesuit College there and included studies in physics, metaphysics and ethics as well as the works of St. Thomas Aquinas (1224‚Äì1274). The Enlightenment, and the arrival of the British after 1759, introduced new ideas into New France, including Cartesian doubt, the atheism of the Enlightenment, and the sovereignty of the polity. A reaction to these ideas ensued, inspired by the French philosopher, Felicite de Lamennais (1782‚Äì1854) and was reflected in the works of the colonial philosopher Abb√© J√©r√¥me Demers. This reaction initially took the form of an objection to, and refutation of these \\"unsettling\\" ideas, adopted by other thinkers, such as Pierre du Calvet. After 1840, in Europe as well as New France the reaction of the Catholic Church to the ideas of the Enlightenment, took the form of stronger response that sought to reaffirm the Catholic view and establish a \\"Catholic\\" philosophy that removed secular uncertainty by reinforcing the place of God at the centre of the daily life. This new philosophy took the form of Thomism, which in many ways is considered the \\"French Canadian\\" philosophy. In the 1920s the study of philosophy was taken up by universities in Quebec, including the University de Montr√©al in 1921 and Laval University in Quebec in 1935. This development was both inspired by and coincident with the publication in 1931 of the Papal pronouncement, Deus Scientarium, which sought to mobilize science as the basis of faith. The new century was also marked by notable contributions to the study of medieval history and philosophy by Father Ephrem Longpres, the Franciscan medievalist and the Dominican philosophers, including Hermas Bastien,http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/bios/bastienhermasbio.htm Charles De Koninck, Father Louis Lachance,http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/8138/Louis-Lachance.html Father Arcade Monette, Father Julien P√©ghaire, Father Louis-Marie Regis, and Father Patrice Robert. = English Canada = In English-speaking Canada, philosophical study was the exclusive domain of the colleges and universities of English speaking British North America and later Canada. Colleges founded during the colonial regime included Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1818, McGill University in Montreal in 1821, the University of Toronto in 1827, Queens University in Kingston, Ontario in 1841 and the University of Ottawa in 1848. The latter part of the nineteenth century witnessed the founding of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg in 1877, l¬¥Universit√© de Montr√©al and the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario in 1878 and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in 1887. The University of Alberta in Edmonton and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, were both established in 1908. All provided courses in philosophy. The Protestant Reformation inspired the first philosophers in English speaking Canada. These scholars all taught at newly created colonial universities, and their studies emphasized the philosophical foundation of religion, in this case Protestantism, the philosophical understanding of the natural world (natural philosophy), and the philosophical basis of political systems. James Beaven's Elements of Natural Theology, which was perhaps the first philosophical work written in English Canada, is an early example. Other notable contributors to these ideas included John Watson at Queen's University in Kingston and George John Blewett at the University of Toronto. Other philosophers included Richard Maurice Bucke of London, Ontario, John Macdonald at the University of Alberta, Herbert Leslie Stewart at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Rupert Clendon Lodge at the University of Manitoba, and George Sidney Brett and John Irving at the University of Toronto. Many of these figures were influenced by the British idealist tradition, represented by figures such as Bernard Bosanquet and Thomas Hill Green dominant in Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of particular note during middle years of the twentieth century was the work of one of Canada's greatest scholars, Harold Innis, of the University of Toronto. Although usually considered an economist and social scientist, his work also reflects an important number of philosophical concepts related to economics and communications. He had a great influence on his colleague Marshall McLuhan. =New disciplines = The growth and specialization of certain elements of philosophy in Europe, in time lead to their establishment as new disciplines, separate from philosophy. Natural philosophy became the study of physics, moral philosophy evolved into sociology and anthropology and psychology became a branch of study free of the influence of philosophy. These developments were reflected in Canada during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The first full professorships in physics as distinct from natural philosophy were established at Dalhousie, Halifax, in 1879, Toronto, 1887 and McGill, in Montreal in 1890. Although these were mainly teaching positions there was some research activity. At Dalhousie, Professor J.G. MacGregor, the first to hold the position at that university, published about 50 papers during his tenure from 1879 until 1899. Other prominent researchers in the field at this time included H.L. Callendar and E. Rutherford, Macdonald professors of physics at McGill and J.C. McLennan at U of T. Psychology in Canada was initially considered a part of the discipline of philosophy and university courses were given by members of philosophy departments. The first course in psychology in Canada was taught at Dalhousie University in 1838 by Thomas McCulloch within the framework of studies in philosophy. By 1866 Dalhousie hosted a chair in psychology and metaphysics. McGill offered courses beginning in 1850 when lectures in the topic were presented by Professor W.T.Leach with a doctorate from Edinburgh. The first psychology text written in Canada was penned by William Lyall of Halifax in 1855. However, by the end of the century psychology was still considered an adjunct to philosophy, not a subject of importance per se, but rather a prerequisite for the advanced study of ethics and metaphysics. Psychology slowly began to make its mark as a separate discipline in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The oldest Psychology Department in North America was founded at the University of Toronto by Professor Mark Baldwin in 1892 along with a related laboratory in psychology. It was here in 1909, that August Kirschmann, who had studied under Professor Wundt at his famous laboratory in Leipzig, undertook the first fundamental psychological research in Canada and presented seminars on the, \\"new psychology\\". Dr. E.A. Brett a noted philosopher at U of T, wrote the three volume History of Psychology between 1912 and 1921. McGill established a psychological laboratory under the directorship of Professor William Dunlop Tait in 1910, followed by the creation of a psychology department separate from philosophy in 1922. McMaster employed a professor in psychology by 1890. The First World War had an important positive effect on the discipline which was recognized for its use in the fields of personnel selection, training and the post-war rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. In the years following World War I, the number of staff at the U of T increased to seven and important research was undertaken by Dr. E.A. Bott relating to the rehabilitation of soldiers with muscular disabilities. By 1927 the psychology department at U of T had achieved full independence from the bonds of the department of philosophy. During this period Hans Selye undertook fundamental studies of stress which cut across the boundaries of medical research, biology and psychology. He began his work at McGill in 1936 and continued his investigations at the University of Montreal starting in 1945. He described the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as the body's mechanism for coping with stress and published a number of books including The Stress of Life in 1953. While still under the influence of the departments of philosophy, noted philosophers such as John Watson at Queens, John MacEachran at Alberta, William Caldwell at McGill and G.S Brett at U of T, championed the recognition of psychology as a discipline in its own right, leading to the creation of separate departments of philosophy and psychology in many universities. By the end of the thirties the growth of the discipline was sufficient to warrant the establishment of the Canadian Psychological Association in 1939. The discipline of sociology evolved from the ideas of philosophers Auguste Comte and √âmile Durkheim in France in the nineteenth century. However it was not until 1922 that Carl A. Dawson was appointed Canada's first professor of sociology at McGill. Honours programmes in sociology were established at McGill in 1926 and at the University of Toronto in 1932. Anthropology evolved from a long history of interest in Canada's native peoples on the part of Jesuit missionaries, explorers and university professors including Sir Daniel Wilson at the University of Toronto and Sir John William Dawson at McGill and the inspiration provided by moral philosophy. Professional anthropology got its start in Canada in 1910 when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier established the Division of Anthropology as a part of the Geological Survey of Canada.  1965‚Äìpresent  =Fields = ;Epistemology Studies in this field have often focused on the philosophy of psychology. Important work in this area has been done in Canada, particularly at the Centre for Cognitive Science at the University of Western Ontario by, Patricia and Paul Churchland, Zenon Pylyshyn, and Ausonio Marras in the early eighties. ;Logic Studies in logic have been undertaken by a number of individuals. Bas Van Fraassen, William Rozeboom and Alasdair Urquhart have specialized in the semantics of logic, while Hans Herzberger and William Harper have studied the nature of preference. John Woods has investigated concepts relating to relevance and paradox. Others have made contributions to the field, including Charles Morgan (modal logics), Charles Morgan (probability semantics), and Anil Gupta (the semantics of truth and paradoxes). ;Philosophy of mind All Group of Thirteen have departments of philosophy with doctorate-level staff members conducting research related to the philosophy of mind. The work of Dr. Paul R. Thagard, at the University of Waterloo, with respect to cognitive functions and coherence, is of note. Charles Taylor, emeritus professor at McGill University in Montreal, has studied consciousness within the context of Hegelianism. Zenon Pylyshyn a psychologist and computer scientist at the University of Western Ontario from 1964 to 1994, has made significant contributions to cognitive science. Other Canadian-born and educated cognitive scientists have made their mark in the US, including David Kirsh, John Robert Anderson, Keith Holyoak, and Steven Pinker. ;Metaphysics and religion Metaphysics deals with the study of the nature of reality. Since the Enlightenment, reality has been seen through the lenses of both religion and science, and frequently there has been a conflict between the views of the two. Following the horrors of the Second World War, the attacks on the views of religion became particularly vigorous with science on the offensive. Canadian philosophers in the postwar era have attempted, in a number of ways, to resolve these conflicts and to legitimize religious belief. A variety of approaches have been used. Some have stressed the similarities between religion and science, as have F.W. Waters (1967) and Alastair McKinnon (1970). Others, including Lionel Rubinoff, have emphasized the importance of placing our scientific view of the world in a larger human context. There have been attempts to resolve the conflict, through science, as seen in the writings of Charles De Koninck (1960), Thomas Goudge (1961), and A.H. Johnson (1962). Others have attempted to argue the rational nature of religious belief. Some, inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas, include Bernard Lonergan (1952), Louis-Marie R√©gis (1959), Joseph Owens (1968), Jean-Louis Allard (1979, 1982), and Lawrence Dewan, OP. More general approaches defending the reasonability of religion have been taken by Leslie Armour and William Sweet. Still others have attempted to address issues in the philosophy of religion by questioning underlying issues in metaphysics. Those following this approach within the analytic tradition include Kai Nielsen, Donald Evans (1963), Terence Penelhum (1970), Alistair M. Macleod (1973), and Jay Newman (1986). Phenomenology has also played a role, as seen in the work of Emil Fackenheim (1961), Benoit Pruche (1977‚Äì1980), Ren√© l'Ecuyer (1980), Jacques Croteau (1981), Cyril Welch (1982), Gary Madison (1988), Hendrik Hart (1990), Jean Grondin (1995), and Thomas De Koninck (1995). ;Ethics ‚Äì social and political philosophy Ethics is the study of questions concerning the nature of right and wrong and good and bad as they relate to human conduct. In many cases, the aim is to use philosophy to make our world and society a better place. Work in the field has grown in the postwar years. Research has been undertaken by a large number of individuals including Francis Sparshott, Kai Nielsen, David Braybrooke, Jonathan Bennett, Gerald Cohen, Donald Brown, Daniel Weinstock, William Sweet, Charles Taylor. Wayne Sumner has been active in the field of applied philosophy. Real Fillion has brought together philosophy and politics in his original work in multiculturalism. The minority position of the French language and culture in Canada and North America is reflected in the preoccupation of a large number of French Canadian philosophers with metaethics. Fernand Dumont, Claude Savary, Jacques Grand'Maison, Michel Morin, Claude Bertrand, Joseph Pestieau, Ferdinand Dumond, Guy Laforest, Louis Balthazar, Vincent Lemieux, Guy Laforest, Fran√ßois Blais, Diane Lamoureux, Michel Seymour, Gerard Bergeron, Maurice Lagueux, Jean Guy Meunier, Serge Cantin, Jean Roy, Guy Lafrance, Roger Lambert, Dominique Leydet, Gilles Labelle, Yvonne Th√©riault, Guy Lafrance, Josiane Ayoub, Pierre Robert, Bjarne Melkevik, and Philip Knee have made important contributions. They may be considered the secular descendants of their Thomist ancestors Of particular interest is the work of the economist and Thomist philosopher Bernard Lonergan, as reflected in Insight: A Study of Human Understanding (1957), and Method in Theology (1972), which described his Generalized Empirical Method. His writings are the subject of a 25 volume collection being edited by the University of Toronto Press. ;Continental philosophy European philosophers of the 20th century launched a number of philosophical movements that were revolutionary both within philosophy and in the larger culture. These movements‚Äîphenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction‚Äîwere often not well received in North American universities, but they have been a regular and growing part of the philosophical landscape of North America since the 1950s, and Canadian universities have played an important role in the development and dissemination of these philosophical ideas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the University of Toronto in particular was internationally known for its experts in what is often called \\"continental philosophy\\". Emil Fackenheim, Kenneth L. Schmitz, Graeme Nicholson, and others made the University of Toronto an international centre for the study of these approaches to philosophical inquiry. At the same time Graeme Nicholson's teacher James Doull, a Hegelian whom Emil Fackenheim notably debated in print on matters relating to the interpretation of Hegel, taught philosophy as well as classical literature in the Classics Department at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Currently, the University of Toronto, with scholars such as Robert Gibbs and Rebecca Comay , Ryerson University in Toronto, with Kym Maclaren, John Caruana, David Ciavatta, and Paula Schwebel, the University of Guelph, with John Russon, and McGill University, with scholars such as Philip Buckley, George Di Giovanni, Hasana Sharp and Alia Al-Saji, are major North American centers for research and teaching in the continental traditions of philosophy. = Associations and related activities = These years saw Canadian philosophy develop to the point where a professional organization, The Canadian Philosophical Association (ACPA), was established in 1958 to encourage and promote philosophy in Canada. This was followed by the founding of regional associations in Ontario, Quebec, the west and Atlantic Canada, and the initiation of the Canadian Philosophical Association Annual Congress.

He was also one of the first senior officers to respond to the Appeal of 18 June. Early life  Following studies at Victor Hugo School, he first tried to volunteer for the French Foreign Legion. Because he was only 15, he was not admitted and so returned to continue his studies.  Military career  = World War I = Admitted to √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1912, he graduated in 1914 part of the \\"promotion de Montmirail\\" with the rank of Sous-lieutenant. On 5 August 1914, he joined the 60th Line Infantry Regiment () and ended the war with the rank of captain. He was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur and 11 citations, wounded 7 times and subsequently retired with 90% invalidity because of a thigh fractured by a bullet, a broken arm due to a grenade, trepanning wounds and gas burns to his eyes. = Interwar period = Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, he was assigned to the Allied Chief Commander of the Orient. He then joined the general staff headquarters as chief of the first bureau in the beginning of 1919 and appointed to command the 1st Moroccan Tirailleur Regiment (, 1er R.T.M). On 25 September, he was designated to conduct a training program at the Center of Aviation of the 415th Infantry Regiment 415e RI of San Stefano where he was appointed as an aviation instructor. Following the assignment, he joined the administrative services of the Levant in Beirut, Lebanon as an adjoint to the administrator. He was designated as an Administrative Council on 1 March 1920 then Inspector on 19 October. In that post, he earned a citation at the order of the armed forces. On 11 May 1921, he was appointed to form the Army of the Levant in the Levant. On 1 July 1921, he assumed command of the 4th combat company of the 1st Squadron, eventually becoming the adjoint of the regimental commander. On 1 March 1924, he finally joined the ranks of the French Foreign Legion. After a brief tour with the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment 1er REI, he was assigned to the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment, 3e REI (the recently-redesignated Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion) and took part in the Moroccan campaign until 1927. Then, he was promoted to the rank of Chef de battaillon (Commandant ‚Äì Major) in 1928. On 14 October 1930, he was designated to take command of the 16th Chasseur Battalion √† Pied (, 16e B.C.P). Following the command, he was reassigned to the Legion in 1931 and would not leave the Legion until October 1941. During his 10-year tenure, he was assigned to the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment, 2e REI, then stationed in Morocco and the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment, 5e REI in Tonkin. = World War II = Returning from the Far East, in January 1938 he assumed command of the instruction battalion at Sa√Øda, while he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 25 June 1938, prior to embarking to Morocco with the 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment 4e REI. On 23 February 1940, he rejoined the 3e R.E.I, which formed a Mountain Marching Battalion Groupment. He was designated as a regimental commander of 2 Legion battalions which formed the 13th Light Mountain Demi- Brigade of the Legion (, 13e DB.L.MLE). Regrouped first in Larzac then Sathonay, his unit prepared for a campaign with destination unknown. This unit would be the forebear of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion, 13e DBLE. On 13 May 1940, at Bjervik, Norway, the 13th DBLE saw action for the first time in the Norwegian Campaign, conquering four objectives and forcing German forces to retreat while abandoning numerous prisoners, automatic arms, equipment and 10 Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft stuck on the ice of a lake. From 28 May to 2 June, Magrin-Vernerey and his Legionnaires were victorious at Narvik, which was referred to as \\"the only French victory of 1939‚Äì1940\\" (la seule victoire fran√ßaise de 1939‚Äì1940).Site de la promotion de Saint-Cyr \\"G√©n√©ral Monclar\\" The 13th DBLE liberated 60 Allied prisoners and captured 400 Germans, 10 cannons and significant material. Barely back to France with 500 of his men, he joined the Free French Forces in England on 21 June 1940 and adopted the name de Monclar (from the village name of Monclar-de-Quercy, Tarn-et-Garonne). He was soon promoted to the rank of Colonel. Leading the 13th DBLE in operations against Axis forces in the East African Campaign with the 1st Free French Division 1re DFL, he took part in the Battle of Keren and the Battle of Massawa. In June 1941, he refused to take part in combat against Vichy French forces in the Levant and particularly the Legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e REI. Following his refusal, he was replaced as commander of the 13th DBLE by Lieutenant-colonel Prince Amilakvari, who led the unit across northern Libya and into Tunisia. Promoted to the first section of officer generals, he exercised various commands in the Levant and participated to numerous campaigns and finished his tour as the Superior Commander of Troops in the Levant. Becoming adjoint to the superior commander of troops in Algeria in 1946, he was in 1948 designated as 2nd Inspector of the Foreign Legion charged with the permanent mission of inspecting Legion units until 1950. Division General Commandant of the French Foreign Legion, L'Etat-major du COMLE (Commandement de la L√©gion √âtrang√®re), Les Chefs COMLE Over the following two years, he constantly visited the various continents where the Legion was stationed and engaged in combat, including in Algeria, Morocco, Madagascar and Indochina. =Korean War= In 1950, at the age of 60 and on the eve of retirement from active duty, he volunteered to command the United Nations bataillon de Cor√©e in course of formation and was voluntarily demoted from g√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e to lieutenant-colonel in order to command the battalion. The battalion was attached to the 23rd Infantry Regiment as part of the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division. In February 1951, the 23rd Infantry Regiment and the Bataillon de Cor√©e fought the Battle of Chipyong-ni. According to the US Army commander in Korea, General Matthew Ridgway: > I shall speak briefly of the 23rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, Colonel Paul L. > Freeman Jr. commanding, [and] with the French Battalion. Isolated far in > advance of the general battle line, completely surrounded in near-zero > weather, they repelled repeated assaults by day and night by vastly superior > numbers of Chinese.

Later life Attaining the limit of service age, he returned to France in 1951. In 1962 while succeeding g√©n√©ral Andr√© Kientz, he became Governor of Les Invalides (), an official function directing the institution and an office in which he died while in tenure, like many other Governors.

The property, acquired in 2001 by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations, is named for the Quinebaug River, which runs through the reservation. The reservation is located off Dug Hill Road in northeast Holland and offers of hiking trails, woodlands, river frontage, a scenic vista, and the remains of a 1930s cabin atop the hogback Blake Hill. The reservation is open to hiking, picnicking, horseback riding, fishing, and cross country skiing. Quinebaug Woods is part of a contiguous area of protected open space including the United States Army Corps of Engineers' East Brimfield Dam/Holland Pond Flood Control and Recreation Area. History The area known today as the town of Holland, Massachusetts was first settled by Joseph Blodgett, who purchased land there in 1730. In 1783, Holland was incorporated as the East Parish of South Brimfield but wasn't incorporated as a town until 1835 when it achieved the necessary fifty voters. The population of Holland remained small (estimated at 300 in 1912) until the 1920s when a significant number of real estate buyers were attracted. Among these new buyers was William Haller, a professor at Barnard College of Columbia University who resided in northern New Jersey. For over ten years Professor Haller and his family- his wife, Malleville and their three children, Bill Jr., Ben and Maria- rented a cottage on Holland Pond where they spent their summers. Then, in 1931, Haller purchased nearly one hundred acres of woodland on the west bank of the Quinebaug River. The land included a hill just north of the Hamilton Reservoir dam that was referred to locally as a ‚Äúhogback‚Äù- an exposed rocky ridge. An old logging road ran to the top of the hill and, here, the Hallers built a cottage. The Hallers visited the Quinebaug camp for many years. It had no running water or electricity. When the Haller children were grown and married, they continued to use the camp. The Hallers eventually became year-round residents of Holland. Bill Sr. and Malleville moved permanently into a small house by the lake. Their son Ben gave a parcel of land across the river from the hill to his son William to build a home and a second parcel to his sister Maria who, in turn, passed the land to her son John. Eventually, Ben had the cabin on the hill torn down, despite the protests of some family members. He felt a wilderness camp was no longer viable in the middle of the heavily settled community that Holland had become. The cabin had been repeatedly vandalized, and extensive repairs had been necessary each spring. In 2001, Ben and Margaret Haller made a gift of their 38 acres of land on the hill, including the site of the former camp, to The Trustees of Reservations. In 2002, Quinebaug Woods became the 90th property of The Trustees of Reservations. Cultural Resources The only known cultural resources on the reservation are the former cabin site and the original chimney still sitting atop the ridge. While it is an interesting landscape feature, this site has little historical or cultural significance either locally or regionally. To date, there have not been any efforts made to maintain the chimney as a landscape feature. Natural Resources Quinebaug Woods is located within the Lower Worcester Plateau/Eastern Connecticut Upland Ecoregion. Forest covers the entire property. Hemlock is abundant and suppresses understory diversity. A ridgeline of exposed bedrock, also referred to as a ‚Äúhogback,‚Äù is a prominent feature along the western boundary. This rock is composed of Paxton and Partridge schists, neutral to slightly acidic metamorphic rocks containing limy quartz and feldspar sandstone. Several small clearings occur along this ridgeline, as does an exemplary vernal pool. A view of the nearby hills can be seen from the largest of the clearings- the former site of the Haller cabin. The Quinebaug River forms much of the property's eastern boundary. Timber harvesting occurred throughout the 20th century, most recently in 2000. The reservation is adjacent to significant acreage owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Holland Pond Recreational Area. The Leadmine Wildlife Management Area, managed by MassWildlife, is located across Sturbridge Road from the reservation. Other protected lands in the area include the Norcross Wildlife Sanctuary and The Trustees‚Äô Tantiusques Reservation. Wildlife In 2002, a breeding bird survey was conducted on the reservation in order to inform management of Quinebaug Woods. During the survey, a total of 37 species of birds were identified on the property including seven species listed as Massachusetts Priority Neotropical Migrant Bird Species. A male northern parula was observed along the river in June 2002. It is unlikely that this state-listed, threatened warbler is breeding on the property as it was only observed on one occasion. It is more likely that this individual was an unpaired male or a late migrant. Brown-headed cowbirds were one of the few problematic or non-native species observed. These birds pose a risk to neotropical migrants in that their habit of laying their eggs in the nests of other species impacts the productivity of native, neotropical migrants. In June 2002, a Louisiana waterthrush was observed feeding an immature cowbird. The acreage of Quinebaug Woods alone is not large enough to support viable populations of wide-ranging species such as a barred owl or broad-winged hawk. However, in conjunction with other contiguous or nearby protected open space, the reservation plays an important role in supporting both wide-ranging and interior species. This may also be true of wide-ranging mammal species, in addition to birds. One significant issue that has the potential to alter bird species composition at Quinebaug Woods is the loss of eastern hemlock trees from hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA). This will likely have the most significant impact on black-throated green warbler and Blackburnian warbler and blue-headed vireo, species that prefer mature mixed forest or conifers as habitat. Recreation The Reservation is open year-round, daily, sunrise to sunset for hiking, bird watching, picnicking, horseback riding, and bow hunting (in season, with permission). There is a short loop trail that goes north along the Quinebaug River before turning west and heading up and over a steep hillside with rocky outcrops. On the exposed ridge there is a stone chimney and foundation steps, the only remains from a cabin built in 1932. From this and other vantage points, you can see Blake Hill to the east and Hamilton Reservoir to the south. References *Quinebaug Woods. The Trustees of Reservations. Retrieved December 8, 2008.

An emulsion dispersion is thermoplastics or elastomers suspended in a waterphase with help of emulsifiers. Preparation Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable liquid/liquid dispersions that are stabilized. Emulsion dispersion is not about reactor blends for which one polymer is polymerized from its monomer in the presence of the other polymers; emulsion dispersion is a novel method of choice for the preparation of homogeneous blends of thermoplastic and elastomer. In emulsion dispersion system the preparation of well-fined polymers droplets may be acquired by the use of water as dispersing medium. The surfactant molecules adsorb on the surface of emulsion by creating a dispersion of droplets, which reduces interfacial tension and retards particle flocculation during mixing. The molecules of surfactant have polar and non-polar parts which act as an intermediary to combine polar and non-polar polymers; the intermolecular interactions between the polar and the non-polar polymer segments resemble the macroscopic hydrocarbon-water interface. The idea of the emulsion dispersion inspired by emulsification of liquid natural rubber (LNR), from particle size analysis and optical microscopy results showed that the droplet size of emulsion of LNR with higher molecular weight is greater than that of the lower molecular weight. Emulsion dispersion was able to produce homogeneous low- density polyethylene (LDPE)/LNR blends and nylon 6/LNR blends. Results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram indicated a single glass transition temperature (Tg) showed that the blends were compatible and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph showed no phase separation between blend components. In addition, exfoliated HDPE/LNR/montmorillonite nanocomposites were successfully achieved by using emulsion dispersion technique as well.

It authorized the Departments of State and Commerce to create regulations regarding the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Background The United States Senate ratified U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on April 25, 1997. On October 25, 1998 the U.S. Congress passed the Chemical Weapons Implementation Act of 1998, legislation which formally implemented the treaty's many provisions. Among those provisions were requirements for signatories to develop new regulations to deal with the transfer of chemicals and technologies that can be used for chemical warfare purposes.Block, Dennis J., and Epstein, Michael A. The Corporate Counsellor's Deskbook, (Google Books), 14-39 2003 Supplement, Aspen Publishers Online, 1995, (). Order Executive Order 13128 was signed by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton on June 25, 1999. EO 13128 partially implemented the CWC, a treaty; treaties can be and are sometimes partially implemented by executive order.Trone, John. Federal Constitutions and International Relations, (Google Books), University of Queensland Press, 2001, p. 92, ().See: Executive Order 13107. In addition, with its signing the order established the U.S. Department of State as the lead national agency for coordinating the implementation of and the provisions of both the CWC and the 1998 law with the various branches and agencies of the federal government.\\"Proposed U.S. Legislation- 110th Congress\\", Federation of American Scientists, official site, accessed December 10, 2008. The executive order also authorized the U.S. Department of Commerce to establish regulations, obtain and execute warrants, provide assistance to certain facilities, and carry out other functions consistent with the CWC and the 1998 act.Gayton, Cynthia M. and Vaughn, Richard C. Legal Aspects of Engineering, (Google Books), Kendall Hunt, 2004, p. 538, (). Results The Department of Commerce published an interim rule on December 30, 1999, through the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which established the Chemical Weapons Convention Regulations (CWCR). The CWCR implemented all provisions of the CWC which affected U.S. persons and industry. The BIS rule was published after extensive comments from the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association and others. The U.S Department of State issued its own regulations which dealt with taking samples at chemical weapons sites as well as criminal and civil punishments for violation of the provisions of the CWC.

It represents Australian-owned record labels and independent artists based in Australia who function without the backing of major record labels. AIR was founded in 1996 in Sydney and is now located in Melbourne. In 2000, it founded the Independent Music Charts, also known as AIR Charts, which track the sales of Australia's highest-selling independent artists on a weekly and monthly basis, and since 2006 the annual Independent Music Awards, or AIR Awards, have been run to celebrate the year's highest-charting independently released Australian singles and albums.  History  AIR was started by a group of Sydney and Melbourne music industry professionals and labels, who began meeting regularly to formulate ideas on how to start an industry association that would assist the ongoing development of Australia's independent record industry. The association was incorporated in 1996 thanks to a small donation from Phantom Records, and received its first operation funding grant from the Australia Council for the Arts in 1998. Additional Australia Council funding was received in 2000, and in this same year, members also voted to change AIR's legal status from Incorporated Association to Company Limited by Guarantee. AIR moved its base from Sydney, New South Wales, to Brisbane, Queensland, in 2004 when Stuart Watters (formerly of Q Music, Queensland's state music council) took over as its Chief Executive Officer. In 2007 AIR moved its operations from Brisbane to Melbourne, Victoria, where it is now based in the Rubber Records and Media Arts Lawyers building in North Melbourne. In 2009 it registered a collective bargaining notification to bargain on behalf of 63 participating members, with each of Telstra, Optus, Foxtel, Austar, MTV, XYZnetworks, Fuel TV (Australia) and Bigpond, regarding the licensing of sound recording rights in respect of public performance and transmission of music videos. The application, which would last for three years, was approved. The collective bargaining power brought a number of benefits to members.  Members  AIR began as a small association with 25 members to a company with over 200 financial members across all sectors of the Australian music industry. AIR's membership of significant Australian Independent Record Labels includes but is not limited to Head Records, Shock Records, Elefant Traks, Obese Records, Dew Process, Liberation Music, Plus One Records, Remote Control Records Pty Ltd, MGM Distribution, UNFD ‚Äì We Are Unified, Ivy League Records, Vitamin Records, Eleven: A Music Company, Red Cat Records, Illusive Sounds, Future Classic, Casadeldisco Records and Jarrah Records. it has about 350 members. Purpose and function AIR is the national industry association representing \\"indie labels\\" in Australia, which aims to represent their members' interests both in Australia and elsewhere. With this sector of the recording industry representing about 85% of all Australian recorded music, AIR's primary role is growing the marketplace for this music. Representing their members individually and collectively is done through advocacy, negotiations, and helping with access to new markets internationally. It services businesses of all shapes and sizes, battles copyright violations and helps to develop artists' careers. AIR represents the Australian industry internationally as a member of Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), a coalition of independent music bodies from countries throughout the world. On 4 July 2008 AIR took part in WIN's Independents Day initiative, the first annual coordinated celebration of independent music across the world. As a major part of these celebrations AIR conducted an online poll for Australia's greatest independent records of all time. 2017 market analysis In 2017, AIR commissioned Deloitte Access Economics to produce AIR Share: Australian Independent Music Market Report, the first market analysis of the industry, which showed that indie labels represented 30% of revenue generated by the Australian recorded music market. It also showed that 57% of independent sector revenue is from Australian artists, which put the Australian sector in the Top 10 global list of mainly English-speaking indie music markets. The report valued the Australian recording industry as worth , sixth largest music market in the world in terms of revenue and ahead of countries with higher populations such as Canada and South Korea. Digital revenue, at 44%, had overtaken that coming from physical sales, at 33%. A spokesperson from the company Unified Music Group said that governments were beginning to recognise the financial and cultural worth of a thriving music industry, but there was still a big challenge for the independents to compete with well-funded tech companies that have an anti-copyright agenda.  Independent Music Charts  In 2000, AIR inaugurated the Independent Music Charts, which track the sales of Australia's highest selling independent artists. The top 20 independent singles and albums were published on a weekly basis, but genre charts for jazz, hip hop, blues and roots, hard rock/punk and country music were published once a month. When J√§germeister took over as major sponsor of the AIR Awards in 2008, they announced that AIR Charts would undergo some changes, including a new website, aimed at developing new audiences for Australian music, both in Australia and worldwide. In 2010 a further three-year deal for sponsorship by J√§germeister was announced, with the awards renamed the J√§germeister Independent Music Awards and the charts J√§germeister Independent Music Charts. When Carlton Dry took over the sponsorship in 2013, the charts were renamed the Carlton Dry Independent Music Charts. , the AIR Charts include four categories and include the top 20 in each: 100% independent singles; 100% independent albums; independent label singles; and independent label albums. The lists are created by AIR from data supplied by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The AIR Charts differ from the ARIA Charts in that they focus on Australian artists represented only by Australian independent labels. the monthly genre categories are no longer published The weekly charts, published on each Monday, feature the top 20 in each of the following categories: 100% Independent Singles; 100% Independent Albums; Independent Label Singles; and Independent Label Albums. The distinction between the \\"100%\\" and \\"Label\\" categories were described in 2009 as follows: * 100% Indie: Independent releases distributed through an independent distributor * Indie Label: Independent releases distributed through any distributor, including a major distributor. The top 50 of the AIR singles charts are also published by online industry magazine The Music Network, along with various other charts. Australian Independent Record (AIR) Awards  Beginning in 2006, the AIR commenced the annual AIR Awards, celebrating the success of Australian independent music. Indie-Con Australia The inaugural \\"Indie-Con Australia\\" music industry conference took place in July 2017 in Adelaide, to coincide with the 11th AIR Awards. The conference has continued until 2019, with the support from the South Australian government. (One article describes it as an \\"offshoot\\" of the Indie-Con UK conference, which is organised by Association of Independent Music AIM, but it appears to be independently run in Australia.) The conference was held at Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute in 2017, at The Hindley (then part of the HQ complex in Hindley Street) in 2018 and at Lot Fourteen in 2019. Sponsors , the City of Adelaide, the South Australian Tourism Commission and the South Australian Government through the Department of the Premier and Cabinet and the Music Development Office (MDO, in the Department of Innovation & Skills)) are major sponsors of the Awards and Indie-Con. Supporting partners include the Australia Council, Moshtix, APRA/AMCOS, radio stations Fresh 92.7 and Radio Adelaide and others.

Bean High School (commonly referred to as Everman, Everman High School, and EHS and also E-Block) is a public secondary school located in Everman, Texas (a suburb south of Fort Worth, Texas). The school is a part of the Everman Independent School District (commonly referred to as Everman ISD) and serves students in grades 9-12. The school mascot is the Bulldog, and schools colors are purple and gold. Everman High School houses students in grades 9-12. Most of the grade 9 classes are taught in the Jefferson Davis, Jr. Ninth Grade Center, which opened to the west of the existing campus in January 2008.  History  Everman High School started out as part of the Everman School in the 1900s. It was a grade school, middle school, and high school for the children of Everman, Texas (then known as the community of Enon). The Everman School building is now Hommel Elementary School. Everman High School was built in the 1950s and is still in use today. In the 1990s, Everman High School was renamed Everman Joe C. Bean High School after Dr. Joe C. Bean (former Everman Independent School District principal and superintendent). Kathy Culbertson began her term as principal in 2003 at around age 26. \\\\- Alternate title \\"Embattled Everman principal to step down\\" The 2006 Texas Education Agency (TEA) accountability rating was unacceptable because the passing rate for African-American students was 33% for mathematics and 32% for science. TEA rules specify that if a racial group fails the tests, the entire school's rating is unacceptable. That year Principal Kathy Culbertson called attention to African-American students specifically over the public intercom. Two weeks later she left her position; she received criticism for using the intercom to call attention to it. Jeri Pfeifer, the superintendent of Everman ISD, stated that Culbertson chose to resign in lieu of reassignment due to a desire to avoid being a \\"divisive element\\". Curtis Amos, initially scheduled to be the principal of Powell Intermediate School, was appointed to replace her. Demographics In 2006, 59% of the students were black.  Sports  Everman High School offers a variety of sports programs and dance ensembles. Current sports offered are Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Powerlifting, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track, and Volleyball. =Basketball= Everman is home of the 2003 Texas 3A State Boys Basketball champions. The team defeated Aransas Pass High School (86-58) in the semi-finals and Tatum High School (72-44) in the finals. In 1997-1998 Everman's boys basketball team became the first non Class 5A school in Texas to be rated in the USA Today National Top 25 Poll starting out the season at 25-0 (at the time Everman was UIL Class 4A). Everman's boys basketball team has also notched a State Tournament appearance in the 1950s and has advanced to the Regional Finals a total of four times and the Regional Semi-Finals seven times in school history. The girl's teams at EHS have not had the same level of success as the boys teams as they have not won a playoff game since the 1980s before finally winning a playoff game during the 2010 season. =Track= Everman High School won the UIL 3A Girls Track & Field Team Champions Championship under Head Coach Steve Beggs in 2001. The girls track team beat out competing high schools with 50 points. In 1995 Everman won the UIL 4A Boys Track and Field Championship beating out Dallas Lincoln and Brenham with 38 points. Among individual/relay state title winners in track and field: Boys 1973 Fred Duevall High Jump (Class 3A) 1980 Leslie Brooks 400m dash (Class 3A) 1983 Kevin Robinzine 400m dash (Class 4A) 1984 Kevin Robinzine 400m dash (Class 4A) 1994 Boys 4x400 Relay Champions (Class 4A) 1994 Shane Stewart Pole Vault Girls 1999 Licretia Sibley 400m dash (Class 4A) 2001 Licretia Sibley 400m dash (Class 3A) 2001 Girls 4x100 Relay Champions (Class 3A) 2001 Girls 4x400 Relay Champions (Class 3A) =Baseball= Everman has produced two players who have spent time in the professional ranks. They played in the state tournament in 1984, losing to Austin Westlake in the State Semi-Finals. = Football = Everman's football program started in the late 1950s and had immediate success, winning three straight district titles from 1960-1962. However, from 1963-1978 EHS posted just one winning season (8-2 in 1972). Everman's football fortunes turned around starting in 1979 with a 7-2-1 record and in 1984 the Bulldogs posted a perfect 10-0 record winning their first district title in 22 years. Since 1979 Everman has had a history of football success posting just four losing seasons (1990, 1996, 1998, 2012). Most of Everman's football success has been under Dale Keeling, who has been head coach since 1998. The Everman High School football team has won two Class 3A state football championships [2001 and 2002]. Everman defeated Sinton High School 25-14 at Texas A&M; University to win the 2001 title; Everman trailed 14-6 at halftime but outscored Sinton 19-0 in the second half for the win. Everman finished the season with a perfect 15-0 record. In 2002, Everman finished the season 14-1 and won their second straight state title beating Burnet High School 35-14 at the Alamodome in San Antonio. That Burnet team featured a pair of future NFL players in QB Stephen McGee and WR Jordan Shipley. The game is probably more famous for a tragic event that took place in the first quarter when Everman DB Corey Fulbright suffered paralysis while making a tackle on a Burnet player. Fulbright underwent emergency surgery at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio to save his life. He was rendered without the use of his arms and legs due to the severity of the injury. In 2007, the football team was named Class 4A district champions after going undefeated in the regular season and going 14-1, but eventually losing in the semi-finals, where they played Highland Park High School and lost 13-42. (Highland Park High School later lost to Lake Travis High School). In 2008, the Bulldogs went 14-1 again but on Saturday December 13, 2008, Everman lost 47-34 to Sulphur Springs High School at Texas Stadium. Sulphur Springs High School was behind in the first quarter but began to take over in the last three quarters. Sulphur Springs would win the Class 4A State Championship the next week. Everman again had a strong season in 2009 advancing to the Class 4A Division II semi-finals before falling to Aledo 35-22. The Bulldogs would finish the season at 11-3. After a few years of limited success between 2010 and 2013, Everman football has rebounded in 2014 and 2015 advancing to the Class 5A Division II quarter-finals in back-to-back seasons. =Powerlifting= Powerlifting is a relatively new sport at Everman but the Bulldogs are among the state's elite programs, winning boys Division I THSPA titles in 2006 (shared with Odessa High), 2007, and 2014.http://www.thspa.us/Documents/Texas%20High%20School%20Powerlifting%20Association%20Team%20Champions%202016.pdf =Soccer=  Dale Keeling Field House  Construction for the Dale Keeling Field House was completed in 2009. The new field house is named after Dale Keeling, Everman ISD's Director of Athletics and Everman High School's head football coach. The estimated construction cost of the site is $5,275,000. The site sits on the northern end zone of J.E. Marr Stadium (Located behind Everman High School). This field house was dedicated to Dale Keeling.

Molybdenite-quartz veins in alkaline granite. Dark silvery gray = molybdenite (MoS2).. Medium gray = quartz. Light colored areas = alkaline granite. The Climax mine, located in Climax, Colorado, United States, is a major molybdenum mine in Lake and Summit counties, Colorado. Shipments from the mine began in 1915. At its highest output, the Climax mine was the largest molybdenum mine in the world, and for many years it supplied three-fourths of the world's supply of molybdenum. After a long shutdown, the Climax mine has reopened and resumed shipment of molybdenum on May 10, 2012. The mine is owned by Climax Molybdenum Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan. History Climax molybdenum mine, Colorado, circa 1924 (USGS photo) The prospector Charles Senter discovered and claimed the outcropping of molybdenite (molybdenum sulfide) veins in 1879, during the Leadville, Colorado Silver Boom, but had no idea what the mineral there was. Senter determined that the rock contained no gold or silver, but retained the claims. The following year he settled with his Ute wife a few miles north, and he made a living working a nearby gold placer. Each year he performed the assessment work required to maintain his lode claims, convinced that his mystery mineral must be of value. In 1918 Senter received $40,000 for his mining claims and \\"settled into a comfortable retirement in Denver.\\" Steve Voynick (1996) \\"Climax\\", Mountain Press Publishing Company, September 1997. This company owns about 50% of Colorado mines. It is relied on by many miners to make profit. Although Senter finally found a chemist who identified the gray mineral as containing molybdenum in 1895, at the time there was virtually no market for the metal. When steelmakers determined the utility of molybdenum as an alloy in producing hard steel, the first ore shipments from the deposit began in 1915, and the Climax mine began full production in 1914. The main ore bearing area was Bartlett Mountain, which was mined out during the early mining. The demand for molybdenum fell drastically at the end of World War I, and the Climax mine shut down in 1919.Stewart R. Wallace and others (1968) Multiple Intrusion and Mineralization at Climax, Colorado, in Ore Deposits in the United States 1933/1967, v.1, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.605-664. Molybdenum later found use in the metal alloys for the turbines of jet engines. Molybdenum is an important metal used in industrial work to increase the resistance of steel because of its much higher melting point compared to that of iron.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. 2004-2001. ‚ÄúWhat is molybdenum‚Äù.

Jan. 1937 pp. 35-40 The extraction of molybdenite hit its highest during World War I, when the army realized that the Germans were using molybdenum as an alloy to strengthen and increase the durability of their weapons and tanks.Gillian Klucas(2004) Leadville: the struggle to revive an American town. Washington, DC : Island Press. Print. The Climax Molybdenum Company re-opened the mine in 1924, and it operated the mine nearly continuously until the 1980s. The mine was shut down between 1995 and 2012, because of low molybdenum prices. The mine's current owner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, continued to work on environmental cleanup of past operations while holding the mine ready in the event of market changes. In December 2007 Freeport-McMoRan reported that it planned to reopen the Climax mine and that production should start in 2010. An initial $500-million project involves the restart of open-pit mining and construction of state-of-the-art milling facilities.Marcia Martinek, It's a go; Climax Mine will reopen, Leadville Herald Democrat, 6 Dec. 2007, p.1, c.1.

Like other porphyry-type ore deposits, the ore is low- grade, much less than one percent molybdenum, but the ore bodies are very large. Beside molybdenum, the mine has also produced tin (from cassiterite), tungsten (from h√ºbnerite), and pyrite as by-products. The rocks of the Climax Stock are alkaline felsic intrusives. They range from porphyritic alkaline rhyolite to alkaline aplite to porphyritic alkaline granite. In map view, the igneous bodies of the Climax Stock form a roughly circular structure. In cross-section view, each intrusion has an inverted bowl shape. Published studies on the origin of the Climax Molybdenum Deposit and other Climax-type moly deposits have concluded that they form principally in incipient extensional tectonic settings well inland from shallow-angle subduction zones that have recently ceased.Climax Molybdenum Deposit, class notes, Ohio State University The Climax deposit is one of a number of large molybdenum deposits in central Colorado and northern New Mexico. Other molybdenum deposits in the region include the Questa mine in New Mexico, and the Henderson and Urad mines near Empire, Colorado. Mining Climax mine, 2005 Historically, mining was principally by \\"sub-level induced panel caving\\", a method that removes ore by undercutting the base of a panel in the ore deposit, causing the rock above to break and drop down in a controlled manner. The method allowed economical extraction of the large low-grade ore deposit. Current mining operations at Climax are via an open-pit. The ore is crushed on-site, and the molybdenite is separated from the waste material by froth flotation, which mixes pulverized ore into a slurry of air, water, surfactants, and other chemicals. The large quantities of waste slurry flows into nearby reservoirs on the adjacent stream drainage to the north. Most of the liquid is drained and the remaining solid pulverized minerals and waste are called tailings. When full‚Äîas seen from the highway‚Äîthese tailings reservoirs look quite striking; something like a cross between a reservoir and a dammed mountain meadow. The Climax tailing impoundment now covers several square miles. Geography The Climax mine is located at (39.365890,-106.185780) at an elevation of about 11,360 feet (3465 meters). It is located on Fremont Pass along the Continental Divide. Remediation and reclamation About 20 different federal or state agencies affected Climax operations, including the U.S. EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. In 1991, the mine declared the Storke Level ore abandoned; no more ore could be extracted profitably, so the company redirected its focus to other activities, such as open-pit reclamation, the haulage of open-pit waste to the tailings dam, and hydromulching, among others. Climax also started the reclamation of a particular highly acidic tailing pond at the head of the Eagle River drainage. It sold the water rights to a company from Vail and started the process of removing and neutralizing the acid tailings to convert the pond to a freshwater reservoir. To do this, they used a ‚Äúhydrology mining‚Äù process to extract the tailings from the bedrock it had been sitting on for several decades. This process converted the compacted tailings to a water slurry that could be easily piped into a pond where it would be chemically neutralized. In 1994, the mine labor force was reduced to 24 employees who were working on five different tasks, including treating water and maintaining environmental quality, environmental reclamation and development of water resources.Stephen Voynick (1996) Climax: the history of Colorado‚Äôs Climax Molybdenum mine. Mountain Press Publishing Company Missoula, Montana. Print. Ground surface subsidence started around 1920 on Bartlett mountain. By 2001, the subsidence area covered about 100 acres on Bartlett mountain. Around the open-pit, caved ground combined with winter avalanches and high vertical pit walls make the West side of the mountain even more susceptible to collapse. Also, the cracks through the rocks created by shifting blocks allow ground water to infiltrate into the working tunnels. This ground water increased the potential for acid rock drainage from the mine.Steve Blodgett (2002) Subsidence Impacts at the Molycorp Molybdenum Mine Questa, New Mexico.

It was a progenitor of the numerous Martello towers the British built in the 19th century throughout their empire. History The Italian architect Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino designed the Tour de Mortella and Colonel Giorgio Doria directed the construction between 1563 and 1564. It was one of a series of coastal defences constructed by the Republic of Genoa between 1530 and 1620 to repulse attacks by Barbary pirates. On 7 February 1794, two British warships, (74 guns) and (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under Major-General David Dundas and Lieutenant-General John Moore after two days of heavy fighting. Late in the previous year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned the tower after (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. Then the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them. Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended and copied the design. However, they misspelled the name as \\"Martello\\" rather than \\"Mortella\\". When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1796, they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state. Current status The ruined tower was listed as one of the official Historical Monuments of France in 1991. The database incorrectly gives the date of construction as 1553‚Äì1554. This earlier date is when Spanish and Genoese troops led by Admiral Andrea Doria besieged the French forces occupying the port of Saint-Florent after the Franco-Turkish invasion of the island.

Biography  Miller was born in Bridport, Dorset on 11 August 1704, the son of a clergyman who possessed two considerable livings in the county. He studied at Wadham College, Oxford, and while there wrote part of his famous comedy, The Humours of Oxford, which contained music by Richard Charke and was first performed on 9 January 1730, to great success. Miller's family was somewhat unsupportive of his theatrical endeavors. They had wanted him to pursue a career in business, but Miller showed a revulsion to such a path. He therefore was persuaded to follow in his father's profession as a minister, taking holy orders soon after he left Wadham. Miller became a lecturer at Trinity College, Conduit Street and a preacher at Roehampton Chapel. The livings for these positions however did not provide for the lifestyle that Miller was accustomed to, so he continued to write for the stage to supplement his income. This decision was met by some hostility by his colleagues in the church and his career as a clergyman suffered to some extent. Regardless, he went on to write eight more plays, many of which were premi√®red at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and contained incidental music by Thomas Arne.The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain. Miller died in Chelsea on 27 April 1744 a few days after his adaptation of Voltaire's tragedy Mahomet opened in London. He was married and had one son.  Works  Miller wrote mostly comedies for the stage and he was known for his use of intelligent parody and wry wit. His known dramatic works include: The Humours of Oxford (1730), The Mother-in-Law (1734), The Man of Taste (1735), The Universal Passion (1737), The Coffee House (1737), Art and Nature (1738), An Hospital for Fools (1739), The Picture, or Cuckold in Conceit (1745), and Mahomet the Imposter (1744, completed by John Hoadly). He also wrote the libretto to George Frideric Handel's Joseph and his Brethren (1744) and translated Moli√®re's comedies for their first publication into the English language. Miller was also a celebrated and prolific poet, of which the satirical poem Harlequin Horace is his most well known work. Miller dedicated the poem to its subject, Mr. Rich, who was the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre at that time. The poem, an ironic portrait and arch mockery of Rich, was payback to a man who had offended Miller. Several of his poems were published in Gentleman's Magazine. Miller also contributed some religious writings, publishing a volume of his sermons. His sermons display an air of distinguished piety, and a zeal for the interest of what Miller called 'true religion'.

History The band were known to have been inspired by the sound of a malfunctioning Mellotron loaned to Tim Smith by Planet Mellotron coordinator Andy Thompson. The Mellotron is used extensively on the Spratleys Japs recordings. (It has since been repaired). The band's original lineup was Tim Smith (bass guitar, vocals, Mellotron), Joanne Spratley (vocals, flugelhorn, Theremin), Heidi Murphy (electronics devices and synthesisers), Mark Donovan (guitar) and Viv Sherriff (drums). Murphy, Donovan and Sherriff were allegedly members of a band called the Rev- Ups, which initially formed near Mexico but subsequently moved to the New Forest area of England. Since the original Spratleys Japs and the Rev-Ups have never played live, it's been suggested that both they and the original band were fictional. Spratleys Japs released one album‚Äî1999's Pony‚Äîand one single, 1999's \\"Hazel\\". Both of these were released on Smith's own All My Eye And Betty Martin Music label. The album sold several hundred copies and the band never performed its material live before the split-up. Joanne Spratley went on to work with Christian Hayes' project MIKROKOSMOS. =Revival (2016‚Äìpresent)= In 2016 Joanne Spratley's son Jesse Cutts suggested they should form a band together and in autumn that year she organized a Spratleys Japs concert in Brighton. It took place on 19 November and was billed as \\"Spratleys Japs Performed Live\\". The concert did not feature Tim Smith, who remained unable to perform following his 2008 stroke and heart attack (although he attended as an audience member) but did feature Spratley plus musicians drawn from various Brighton bands including Clowwns, Crayola Lectern, Muddy Suzuki and Heavy Lamb. The concert led in turn to a full revival of Spratleys Japs featuring the new lineup, which includes, alongside Joanne and the bassist Cutts, Adrien Rodes (keyboards), Etienne Rodes (guitars), and Damo Waters (drums). They did assorted concerts in England during 2017, including a small tour. On 18 December 2018, the single \\"Her/Hands\\" was released, Tim Smith credited as its executive producer, followed by a Christmas gig at the Garage club to celebrate an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Music from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Smith had received in October. On 4 February 2019, the band had a session with Marc Riley. On 17 May 2019, they supported Gong at Oslo (Hackney) and planned to release the new album by the end of the year.

The bunker complex was a secure U.S. government storage facility from World War II until 2013. As of April 2015, Smart Warehousing, based in Kansas, owns the Atchison Caves. The facility, which is adjacent to Jackson Park in Atchison, has 125 acres of above ground land and 60 acres of underground storage space and has been called the \\"World's Largest One-Level Storage Facility\\". History In 1886, George W. Kerford began to quarry limestone from the large bluffs 2 miles (3.2 km) south of downtown Atchison, Kansas. Initially, the company produced riprap for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, one of several railroads that traveled through the area. The Kerford Quarry Company's operations at the site resulted in a series of large caverns supported by pillars of unmined rock. The mines in the quarry grew to encompass more than 60 acres of underground space. =World War II= During the Second World War, the United States War Food Administration was tasked with collecting and storing reserve farm products to support the war effort. A businessman in Atchison suggested to them that the Kerford Mines would be an ideal facility to store perishables due to the constant temperature and humidity in the caverns. In July 1944, the Kerford Quarry Company stopped their mining operations and began to lease the facility to the government for the sum of US$20,000 each year. The government immediately began renovations, spending nearly $2 million to create a refrigerated storage facility where the temperature would be maintained at 32 degrees. The War Food Administration stored perishables including meat, fruits, vegetables, dairy products and eggs in the facility. By 1949, reports indicate that the Atchison Storage Facility held nearly 9,000 tons of eggs, 20,000 tons of prunes, 1,000 tons of raisins and nearly 50 tons of milk. =The Cold War= In the years leading up to World War II, the Army Ordnance Department suffered from a shortage of specialized production machine tools. These highly specialized tools were necessary to make the increasingly complex weapons used in modern battles. In the drawdown following the war, the Army began to stockpile these tools to be held in reserve status to be used in the event of another national mobilization. The Atchison Storage Facility, with its constant temperature, low humidity and protection from the building threat of nuclear weapons,An Evaluation of the Shelter Potential in Mines, Caves and Tunnels U.S. Department of Defense 11 Jun 1965 was chosen to be part of the Ordnance Corps Production Equipment Readiness Program. The tools were held in a state of readiness, to be shipped nationwide to manufacturers in the event of a national emergency. In 1952, the facility was renamed the United States Storage Facility- Atchison Caves. The Army converted two of the largest mines (more than of underground space) into storage areas with the installation of concrete block walls, concrete floors, electrical lighting, sump pumps, air handling equipment and an extensive dehumidification system. To facilitate moving the large machine tools in and out of the storage facility a truck receiving dock was built near the entrance, a railroad spur and dock were constructed and dock facilities for barges were established on the Missouri River. In addition, a shop to refurbish and maintain the machine tools was established at the facility. At its peak, a private contractor was responsible for maintaining more than 5,000 machine tools in the reserve facility. In 1977, the facility was transferred to the Defense Logistics Agency and it was renamed as the Atchison Storage Facility. It was later used to store surplus parachutes (more than 8,500), medical supplies and important defense department documents, plans and computer files. Documents classified as \\"Secret\\" were securely stored inside two large vaults. Until 2013 it was operated by the Army Reserve's 88th Regional Support Command in Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. Defense Department documents listed the facility's use as storage and training. They list the size of the facility as above ground and below ground. In the 1990s some hazardous materials were identified at a former landfill at the site. Extensive site remediation was conducted and groundwater monitoring is being conducted in cooperation with the State of Kansas. Ownership In April 2013, the entire facility and property was sold via an online GSA Auction. The final sales price was $510,001.00. One of the new owners was Coby Cullins, a businessman from Missouri. However, by April 2015, Smart Warehousing owned the Atchison Caves.

The songs that made the album were the ones that came together by the deadline I had to meet for the release, leaving six or seven great song foundations for the next album.\\" \\"Country Road\\" was based upon John Denver's \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\". Ward built a new song around the chorus of Denver's song. Reception The album received a negative review from Blabbermouth.net.

Founded in the mid-13th century by William II of Villehardouin, the town served as the main port and mint of the Frankish Principality of Achaea, being located next to the Principality's capital, Andravida. Commerce with Italy brought great prosperity, but the town began to decline in the early 15th century as the Principality itself declined. In 1428, Glarentza was ceded to the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea, and served as its co-capital, being the residence of one of the Palaiologos despots, until the Ottoman conquest in 1460. Under Ottoman rule, Glarentza declined rapidly as the commercial links with Italy were broken, and by the 16th century was abandoned and falling into ruin. Little remains of the town today: traces of the city wall, of a church and a few other buildings, as well as the silted-up harbour.  History  Map of the Peloponnese with its principal locations during the late Middle Ages Glarentza was founded in the mid-13th century by William II of Villehardouin (ruled 1246‚Äì78), the ruler of the Principality of Achaea, a Frankish state established after the Fourth Crusade and encompassing the Peloponnese or Morea peninsula in southern Greece. Its Frankish foundation is evident in its name, Clarence or Clairence in French, Chiarenza or Clarenza in Italian, Clarentia or Clarencia in Latin, rendered ŒöŒªŒ±œÅŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÉŒ± (Klarentsa), ŒöŒªŒ±œÅŒØŒΩœÑŒ∂Œ± (Klarintza), or ŒìŒªŒ±œÅŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ∂Œ± (Glarentza) in contemporary Greek documents. The medieval town was located a bit further west of the modern village of Kyllini, on the northern tip of a headland that forms the westernmost point of the Peloponnese. This was a site known since Antiquity as the best anchorage in all of Elis, and was likely the site of the ancient city of Cyllene. Glarentza was established as the haven for the Principality's capital, located inland at Andravida, some away. Along with Andravida and the fortress of Clermont or Chlemoutsi, some from the port, Glarentza formed the administrative heart of the Principality of Achaea. Glarentza profited from its location and became the main port for communication and traffic between the Morea and Italy. As described in the town's Greek Ministry of Culture website, Glarentza \\"rapidly established itself as the most important financial and urban centre of the Crusader principality, with an international renown\\", while according to the medievalist Antoine Bon, it was \\"the agglomeration which should most resemble, by its activity, a city in the modern sense of the word\\". It was a cosmopolitan city, frequented by emissaries from Italy, soldiers and merchants, chiefly Venetians. Trade brought great prosperity, as evidenced by the fact that it used its own system of weights and measures in the 14th century. It featured a hospital as well as banks, lodgings for the mariners, and a Franciscan monastery. Based on a 1391 list of fiefs, the town counted ca. 300 hearths, making it among the largest in the Principality. Denier tournois of Princess Isabella of Villehardouin, struck at Glarentza The town was also the site of the princely mint, which from the 13th century until its cessation, in 1353, struck denier tournois or tornese coins, inscribed initially with [DE] CLARENTIA, and, from the reign of Florent of Hainaut (ruled 1289‚Äì97) onwards, with DE CLARENCIA. Although Andravida was the main residence of the princely court, Glarentza too was a location of political significance, and several parliaments and assemblies took place there, such as the adjudication on the inheritance of the Barony of Akova in 1276, or the parliament and oath of allegiance to Isabella of Villehardouin and Florent of Hainaut in 1289. Glarentza was surrounded by a set of walls, but scholars have long disputed exactly when this was done. The debate concerns the relation between Glarentza and the nearby fortress of Clermont/Chlemoutsi, which in the view of those who consider Glarentza to have originally been unfortified served as the town's citadel, in which case this was probably the original site of the mint, whence its alternative name of \\"Castel Tornese\\". In June 1315, Glarentza was captured by the Aragonese troops of the infante Ferdinand of Majorca, who claimed the princely title of Achaea for himself by virtue of his marriage to Isabella of Sabran, granddaughter of William II of Villehardouin. Ferdinand made Glarentza his residence, and soon seized all of Elis, aided by the defection of several Achaean barons dissatisfied with the Principality's rule by the Angevins of Naples. Ferdinand began minting coins with his name‚Äîthe rarest issues of the Glarentza mint‚Äîbut his reign was cut short with the arrival of the legitimate claimants, Matilda of Hainaut and Louis of Burgundy. In the Battle of Manolada, fought to the northeast of Glarentza on 5 July 1316, the Aragonese were defeated and Ferdinand was killed. The remainder of his army fled to Glarentza, and soon handed over the town and the other fortresses they had occupied and departed the Peloponnese, taking the corpse of Ferdinand with them. The town's decline began in the early 15th century, following the worsening fortunes of the Principality itself. At that time, Achaea, under Prince Centurione II Zaccaria (ruled 1404‚Äì30), found itself endangered by the attacks of the Byzantines of the Despotate of the Morea on the one hand and the expansionist designs of the Tocco family of Cephalonia and Zakynthos on the other. In late 1407, Centurione's own brother-in-law Leonardo II Tocco seized Glarentza and reaped an enormous booty, as recorded in the Chronicle of the Tocco. It took several years of conflicts and diplomatic manoeuvrings before a Venetian-mediated deal restored the city to Centurione in July 1414. In 1417, the Byzantines under the Despot Theodore II Palaiologos and his brother John VIII Palaiologos, launched another attack on the remains of the Principality. The brothers made swift progress, forcing Prince Centurione to retire to Glarentza, which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Byzantines. A truce was concluded in 1418, but in the same year, an Italian adventurer, Olivier Franco, seized the town, which in 1421 he sold to Carlo I Tocco, Leonardo's elder brother. Miniature portrait of Constantine XI Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea and last Byzantine emperor With Glarentza in their hands, the Tocchi now began to openly pursue their aspirations in the Peloponnese, and attacked the territories of the Latin Archbishop of Patras Stephen Zaccaria, Centurione's brother. In 1427, the Byzantines, led by emperor John VIII in person, attacked the Tocco lands in the Peloponnese. After the Byzantine fleet defeated his navy, Carlo was forced to submit, and in 1428, Glarentza was handed over as part of the dowry of his niece, Maddalena, who was married to the Despot Constantine Palaiologos (the future last Byzantine emperor). When Constantine besieged Patras in 1429, a Catalan fleet that came to the city's aid captured Glarentza, forcing Constantine to ransom it back. He then destroyed its fortifications, so that it could no longer be seized and used by a western power. In 1430, following the final subjugation of the Principality of Achaea by the Byzantines, the Peloponnese was divided into appanages among the various Palaiologos princes. Glarentza became the residence of Thomas Palaiologos until 1432, when he exchanged his portion with Constantine, who had originally settled at Kalavryta. In 1446, Glarentza and its surrounding region were raided by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Murad II, and in 1460, it fell to the Ottomans along with the remainder of the Byzantine Peloponnese. Although nearby Chlemoutsi continued to play a role as a military stronghold until the 19th century‚Äîit was garrisoned by the Venetians during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War of 1463‚Äì79, and attacked by the Knights of Malta in 1620‚ÄîGlarentza itself seems to have rapidly fallen into obscurity under the Ottomans, apparently declining as the maritime links with Italy were severed. By the 16th century, it was already abandoned and half-ruined. The ruins were described by successive travellers until the 19th century, and photographs were also taken later. During the German occupation of Greece in World War II, the German Army demolished many of the remains. In the early 19th century, several authors and travellers, like Robert Byron, contended that Glarentza (in its Latin form, Clarentia/Clarencia) gave its name to the royal English title of the \\"Duke of Clarence\\", via Princess Matilda of Hainaut and her cousin Philippa of Hainaut, a claim that has been repeated by reputable publications like the Meyers Konversations-Lexikon encyclopedia into the 20th century. However, this view was conclusively rejected already in 1846 by the military officer and antiquarian William Martin Leake, who pointed out that at no time did English royalty hold Moreote titles, and that \\"Clarence\\" originates from Clare, Suffolk, and not Glarentza. Location and archaeological remains Sketch outline of Glarentza (east on top), 1906/7 The town of Glarentza was situated on a small plateau, sloping slightly downwards from west to east, at the extreme northwestern end of the peninsula known in Antiquity as Chelonatas. The town occupied an irregular shape of ca. from east to west and from north to south, i.e. a surface of ca. . The northern and western sides of the town bordered on the sea and were protected by a cliff of some 50 m in height descending to the sea. The port was located in the north, shielded from the dangerous western and southwestern winds. There are very few material remains of the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations it does not appear to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals. Among the few remains of buildings from the interior of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation. The site is currently managed by the 6th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. It is accessible by car, and is open for visitors. References Sources    External links  * D.

Chairs load from the station on the left of this image, gondolas along the carpeted area to the right. The top of Doppelmayr's \\"Le Grand Cerf\\" at Les Sept Laux, outside of Grenoble, France. Chairs exit to the right, gondolas on the left. Le Hybrid, Mont Orford, Canada Telecomb Du Mont-Rond, France A hybrid lift is a type of ski lift that combines the elements of a chairlift and a gondola lift. First introduced by Poma, who refers to them as Telemix, they have since been built by most lift manufacturers who refer to them by a variety of names; Doppelmayr refers to them as a combined lift, Bartholet refers to them with the French name, t√©l√©port√© mixte, while the more generic terms chondola and telecombi are common in North America. Both chairs and gondolas have advantages for lift operations. Gondolas offer protection from the elements and are particularly useful in rain or very cold conditions. They can also be used during the summer for walk-on guests, cyclists or wheelchairs, and in the winter for snowshoers. In the winter, gondolas require skiers and snowboarders to remove their equipment and walk into the cabin. Chairs are generally more convenient and easier to board for skiers. Some lifts have so-called 'bubble' chairs, which add a retractable acrylic glass dome to protect passengers from weather. A hybrid lift allows cabins and chairs to be used on the same lift line, changing the ratio as the rider load, season and weather conditions demand. On most hybrid lifts, during the winter season there are usually more chairs than cabins, for example, the hybrid lift at Sunday River has 60 chairs and 15 cabins, with four chairs between each cabin. During the summer season, many hybrid lifts will operate with fewer chairs, or with gondola cabins only. Year-round versatility is increasingly important as ski resorts add summertime activities, such as downhill cycling and nature hiking trails. To allow safe loading and unloading, stations have separate areas for the different carrier types. This may resembling a gondola station followed by a chairlift station, or vice versa ‚Äì the overall length of the boarding area can be reduced by folding the station so that the gondolas are loaded on the \\"downhill\\" side of the ends of the lift, and the chairs on the uphill side. In some stations the cabins may use a separate contour. Installations around the world =Australia= Australia has two ski lifts that mix gondolas and chairs. Northside Express (formerly named Horse Hill) built in 1986 at Mount Buller in the state of Victoria was the first Doppelmayr hybrid lift in the world. It has 106 chairs and 20 gondolas. The second to be built in Australia was the 1860-metre-long Crackenback (since renamed Kosciusko Express), built in 1990 at Thredbo ski resort in New South Wales. It was also built by Doppelmayr.Australian Ski Lift Directory, Section 2.1.3. https://www.australianmountains.com/australianskilifts#2 =Europe= In Austria, the \\"Sun Jet\\" was finished in 2008 on the mountain of Hochwurzen, Schladming.Planai & Hochwurzen official site In 2010 the \\"Kombibahn Penken\\" in Mayrhofen, Austria was built. This was the first hybrid lift with separated loading areas for chairs and gondolas. The \\"Weibermahdbahn\\" in Lech in Vorarlberg was built in 2011 by Doppelmayr for the Ski Arlberg ski resort. It alternates between 8-person chairlifts and 10-person gondolas. In 2013 the \\"Auenfeldjet\\", a gondola lift for 10 persons, was linked to it. In France, Poma has installed at least ten hybrid lifts, and Doppelmayr three.

In Italy, the Telemix \\"Puflatsch\\" at the Seiser Alm was built in 2009. In Norway, the ski mountain Strandafjellet installed a Leitner Telemix lift in the summer of 2010. The lift has 3 six-passenger chairs followed by one eight-passenger gondola. The lift opened on February 12. 2011, and is the biggest chairlift in Scandinavia. The lift is 2100 metres long, has a 618 metres height difference and a capacity of 2400 people per hour per direction. In Slovakia, a Telemix at the Donovaly ski resort was installed by Poma in 2005. It has 60 chairs and 10 cabins. Sweden's first hybrid lift was installed in √Öre ski resort in √Öre, Sweden. The new hybrid lift is named 'VM 8:an' and replaces the former four- passenger chair lift 'Olympialiften'. The lift was installed by Leitner in 2006 and consists of 16 eight-passenger gondola cabins, and 68 eight-passenger chairs. In Verbier, Switzerland, lift manufacturer Leitner Ropeways installed a hybrid lift, \\"La Chaux Express\\", in 2005. The 60 cabins, manufactured by CWA, each hold 8 passengers whilst the 20 chairlifts can each hold up to 6. The result is a maximum capacity of 1950 to 2400 persons per hour.Leitner Ropeways The lift also has multiple stations; the valley station at 2200 m, and the middle at 2484 m which angles the route of the lift, allowing the second lower station at 2260 m.Lift-Database The middle station is most commonly disembarked during the ski season as it lies in the \\"middle\\" of the slopes.

Peng Pai was one of the few Chinese intellectuals who were aware in the early 1920s that peasantry and land issues caused the most critical problems for Chinese society. He believed that the success of any revolution in China must depend on the peasants as its base foundation. Background and early life Peng Pai was born on October 22, 1896, into an elite Hokkien speaking landlord family and an heir to great wealth. The Peng family, with about thirty members, owning lands cultivated by peasant tenants who, with their families, numbered more than 1,500; so each one of the Peng family controlled about fifty peasants. Peng Pai‚Äôs sociopolitical views were partly influenced by his mother, Zhou Feng (). Zhou Feng came from an impoverished family. At the age of eighteen, she was sold by her parents as a concubine to Peng Pai‚Äôs father Peng Xin (ÂΩ≠Ëæõ, another first-name Shou-yin ÂØøÊÆ∑). At that time, Peng Xin already had two sons by his first wife. Pai‚Äôs mother had three sons of her own: Peng Hanyuan (), Peng Pai, and Peng Shu ().ÂΩ≠Ê±âÂû£ Hanyuan and Shu later actively joined and assisted Pai in the peasant movement launched and led by Pai. All three brothers lost their lives for this cause. They are officially honored as \\"Revolutionary Martyrs\\" by the People‚Äôs Republic of China. In 1916, as a student in the local Haifeng County High School (now named as \\"Peng Pai Memorial High School\\" since 1955),Êµ∑‰∏∞ÂéøÂΩ≠ÊπÉÁ∫™Âøµ‰∏≠Â≠¶ Peng Pai became rebellious. He protested against the local gentry‚Äôs plan to placate a hostile official by building a statue of this local warlord.  Study in Japan (1917‚Äì1921)  Peng Pai went to Japan in 1917 and studied politico-economics after admitted into the Waseda University, Tokyo. There he experienced several historical events of \\"Aftermath of World War I\\" that forever changed China and Sino-Japan relations. He witnessed the \\"Rice Riot\\" of 1918 in Japan, and was influenced by impact of the 1917's Russian Revolution. In consequence, Peng Pai converted from a Christian to a Socialist. He believed that only socialism, and only complete social, political and economic revolution in the creation of a socialist system, could ensure China‚Äôs survival. Reports on the Haifeng Peasant Movement by Peng Pai, published in 1926. The title's Chinese Characters were handwritten then by Zhou Enlai  Education commissioner of Haifeng (1921‚Äì1922)  Peng Pai finished his study in Japan and returned to his hometown Haifeng in the summer of 1921. He was appointed as the Commissioner of the Education Bureau of Haifeng County in October. He created new schools, revised the curriculums, and recruited young teachers and principals with pro-socialist ideals. He organized a May Day celebration parade to the county seat involving his students and \\"many boys and girls of wealthy families\\" in 1922.  Launching and leading peasant movement (1922‚Äì1926)  In the summer of 1922, Peng Pai was dismissed from the Education Commissioner position because of his organizing the May Day parade. Soon after he left that position, Peng Pai launched and led the peasant revolution movement in Haifeng. He advocated socialism by editing a journal Red Heart Weekly (or Sincere Heart Weekly) and using a gramophone to play music and songs to gather the villagers and try to convince them to form peasant organizations. To politically awaken peasants and encourage them to fight for their own rights and to liberate themselves from social injustice, Peng Pai burned all the title deeds of his inherited lands in public, and announced to his peasants that the lands they were cultivating henceforth belonged to them. After such unusual and sincere efforts, he succeeded in forming the first countywide Peasant Association in China, the Haifeng County Peasant Association. The association campaigned for lower rents, led anti-landlord boycotts, and organized welfare activities. He was elected the Association President on New Year‚Äôs Day in 1923. By that time, the Association claimed its membership of about 20,000 families covering 100,000 persons, or one-quarter of the population of the entire county.Current Intelligence Staff Study -Mao Tse-Tung And Historical Materialism. April 1961. p8 In 1924, Peng Pai became a member of Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) as individuals and served as the Secretary of Peasant Department of KMT Central Committee, as the KMT-CCP Alliance had been formed since 1923. The KMT was then led by Sun Yat-sen and carried out the policies of \\"alliance with Soviet Russia, cooperation with the Communists, and assistance to peasant and worker movements\\". Based on Peng Pai‚Äôs idea and suggestion, the KMT Central Committee decided to set up Guangzhou Peasant Movement Training Institute (PMTI) to train young idealists who then went out to educate the masses in rural China. Peng Pai was the director of the 1st and 5th terms of the PMTI, while Mao Zedong was the director of the 6th term. Peng Pai finished his famous Report on the Haifeng Peasant Movement there and published it in The Chinese Peasants in 1926.  A CCP leader establishing the first Soviet in China (1927‚Äì1928)  A Statue of Peng Pai in Haifeng, Guangdong Province, China. On April 12, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek and his right wing in the KMT launched the historic incident of \\"Party purge\\" or \\"Shanghai massacre of April 12 Coup\\". Many prominent Communist and left wing members of the KMT along with tens thousands of the masses suspected pro-CCP were imprisoned or slaughtered. Peng Pai was elected as a member of the CCP Central Committee on the 5th National Congress held in Wuhan during April and May. He was lately appointed as a member of the CCP Front Committee led by Zhou Enlai for organizing and directing the Nanchang Uprising launched on August 1 of that year. He was elected as an alternate-member of CCP Politburo on the August 7th Emergency Meeting of the party. Peng Pai returned to Guangdong following the Nachang Uprising troops, and established the Hai-Lu-Feng Soviet Worker-Peasant-Soldier Government and Territory Base after successful organizing and launching an armed uprising in Haifeng and Lufeng counties in mid November. He was the President of the Hai-Lu-Feng Soviet, the 1st Soviet in Chinese history. As a reply to the \\"White Terror\\" launched on April 12 by Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT, the Hai-Lu-Feng Soviet engaged in a \\"Red Terror\\". Jung Chang and Jon Halliday in their disputed book \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" described that under Peng's leadership of the short-lived Hailufeng Soviet villages were leveled and more than 10,000 people were killed. Being a Hoklo speaker, he made an effort to learn the peasant Hakka language to better communicate with the local Hakka peasant who formed the entire native population of the Hailufeng territories. In the spring of 1928, less than four months after its inauguration, the Hai-Lu-Feng Soviet was crushed by KMT troops with overwhelming superiority. Peng Pai left Guangdong for Shanghai following CCP Central Committee‚Äôs directive. In July 1928, on the 6th National Congress of the CCP, Peng Pai was elected as a Politburo member and served as the Secretary of the Central Agrarian Movement Committee and a member of the Central Military Affairs Commission of the CCP.  Imprisonment and death (1929)  In 1929, Peng Pai was betrayed by his meeting secretary Bai Xin (). This led to Peng, Yang Yin () and three other CCP leaders being arrested by the KMT government when attending a meeting in Shanghai on August 24. Peng Pai firmly refused to surrender or renounce his beliefs, even under torture, during his imprisonment. Zhou Enlai, leading the Central Special Task Units (CSTU) of the CCP, organized an action attempting to rescue Peng Pai but this failed. On August 30, Peng Pai was secretly killed at Longhua, Shanghai by the KMT government on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek. On November 11, per Zhou Enlai‚Äôs order, Chen Geng and Gu Shunzhang directed the CSTU with its Red Squad to kill Peng's betrayer, Bai Xin, outside of his hidden shelter in Shanghai. In memory of Peng Pai and Yang Yin, the CCP named its military academy the \\"Peng-Yang Military Academy of the Red Army\\".

She confesses to have a strong craving for sweet things. Kahoko has never played or touched a violin until she meets the strange music fairy, Lili.

She is a polite and considerate girl who puts others' feelings before her own, though at times she can appear rather naive, especially in music. The boys involved in the concourse have obvious crushes on her, though Kahoko is unable to figure that out because of her sweet, but dense personality. She also is unable to realize that every time she feels depressed, the other members strangely feel the same way.

As told by Mizue, he was also in the basketball club when they were in middle school. He does not like Tsukimori, and they often get into many disagreements. Their arguments can vary in topics, from a notebook to their style of performance. This rivalry happens possibly because of the fact that they are falling for the same girl.

In the middle of the series, he starts to call Kahoko \\"Kaho-chan\\", instead of the usual \\"Hino- chan\\", because he has a rather obvious crush on her.

A neutral sixth is a musical interval wider than a minor sixth but narrower than a major sixth . Three distinct intervals may be termed neutral sixths: * The undecimal neutral sixth has a ratio of 18:11 between the frequencies of the two tones, or about 852.59 cents. * A tridecimal neutral sixth has a ratio of 13:8 between the frequencies of the two tones, or about 840.53 cents. Jan Haluska, The Mathematical Theory of Tone Systems, CRC (2004). This is the smallest neutral sixth, and occurs infrequently in music, as little music utilizes the 13th harmonic. * An equal-tempered neutral sixth is 850 cents, a hair narrower than the 18:11 ratio. It is an equal-tempered quarter tone exactly halfway between the equal-tempered minor and major sixths, and half of an equal-tempered perfect eleventh (octave plus fourth). These intervals are all within about 12 cents of each other and are difficult for most people to distinguish. Neutral sixths are roughly a quarter tone sharp from 12 equal temperament (12-ET) minor sixths and a quarter tone flat from 12-ET major sixths. In just intonation, as well as in tunings such as 31-ET, 41-ET, or 72-ET, which more closely approximate just intonation, the intervals are closer together. A neutral sixth can be formed by subtracting a neutral second from a minor seventh. Based on its positioning in the harmonic series, the undecimal neutral sixth implies a root one minor seventh above the higher of the two notes. Thirteenth harmonic Thirteenth harmonic on C. The pitch ratio 13:8 (840.53 cents), is the ratio of the thirteenth harmonic is notated in Ben Johnston's system as A13. In 24-ET is approximated by A. This note is often corrected to a just or Pythagorean ratio on the natural horn, but the pure thirteenth harmonic was used in pieces including Britten's Serenade for tenor, horn and strings.Fauvel, John; Flood, Raymond; and Wilson, Robin J.

He published a number of works and was an English professor at Vanderbilt University for more than fifty years. He wrote chiefly about the literature, the society, and the values of the south. He was a founding charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers. Life Walter Sullivan was born in Nashville. His father died three months after he was born, and Walter, an only child, spent his childhood living with his mother and various aunts, uncles, and grandparents.Walter Sullivan, Nothing Gold Can Stay, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, 2006, pp. 1-26. After attending local schools, he began his studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 1941, studying creative writing under Donald Davidson.Sullivan, Nothing Gold Can Stay, p. 49. He served in the Marines during World War II but the war ended before he was assigned to combat. He resumed his studies at Vanderbilt and graduated in 1947. He married Jane Harrison and they moved to Iowa City, where he earned an MFA at the University of Iowa, studying under Andrew Nelson Lytle.Sullivan, Nothing Gold Can Stay, p. 113. He then returned to Vanderbilt and taught in the English department there from 1949 until his retirement in 2001.Sam Pickering, \\"A Golden Book\\", Sewanee Review, Fall 2005, pp. xciii-c. He deplored the change in English studies from the close study of the great texts to the dominance of various forms of theory, and was one of the founders of the Fellowship of Southern Writers in 1987. \\"We [the members of the FSW] believed that language could accurately communicate an author's intentions and that truth or an aspect thereof was available to those who were sufficiently gifted to find it. But ... our beliefs and our writings, our very selves, were anathema to a large part of the literary world.\\"Sullivan, Nothing Gold Can Stay, pp. 166-67.

She is signed to Sony Music Japan International. Her latest mini album, My Road ~ Songs for Guin Saga was released on August 26, 2009. Her fifth album planned to be released on March 31, 2011, as she stated on her blog. But, somehow she postponed it. Her most recent album was released on April 27, 2011. The album's title is \\"A New Story\\" Biography Kanon was born in Japan and lived much of her childhood abroad. Growing up in a western world led her to pick up many such habits and customs, one of which includes a fluent tongue in English. She began participating in a choir at age 13, in which she acquired a fair amount of interest in classical vocalization as well as vocal technique. Kanon grew to appreciate famous composers such as Handel and Chopin. Little did she know that this timely love of classical music would mature and blossom into what will become the cornerstone of her career as an artist. She debuted in July 2002 with her first live performance shortly after graduating the Queensland Conservatorium in Australia. A year later, Kanon released [Alleluia], a mini- album containing various songs in her own piano self-accompaniment. That same year she was invited to perform live in Russia at the Moscow Baptist Church, the Red-Plaza stage, and at a home for the elderly. She was very popular with the crowds and was deemed a highly regarded Japanese representative. The first year-and-a-half of her career proved to be a fantastic display of vocal prowess, but also, in particular, lacked in original compositions. It wasn't until February 2004 when Kanon released the album [Hymn of Grace], this one being the first to include songs written and composed by her. Prior to this release she solely sang covers of songs (usually ones that fall under the category of popular folk songs) indigenous to various regions of the world. Equipped with a beautiful face and a voice to match, Kanon aspired to reach the pinnacle of her potential, possibly out of a desire to far exceed the positive feedback from listeners all around the world. They say her voice is \\"one that heals,\\" which is an accurate description considering her soothing vocals and extensive range. Sony Music Japan International recognized her talents and together they released her first single [KISEKI Song of Love] in October 2004. The following year was busy, portentous to Kanon's promotion now that she had her newly signed contract under Sony Music. June 2005 opened up with her album [Primary Flowers] as well as an invitation to sing Japan's national anthem during the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany-Asia public showing. She ended the year with a flowering demonstration and a live performance in Tokyo in October. The release of her mini-album [Destiny] was complement to this display. In 2006, Kanon released three singles, [Kokoro], [My Destiny/Serenade], and [Brand New Breeze]. Her December album [Sanctuary] became the accumulation of her 2006 work with a few new additions. Kanon was invited to perform at MIDEM 2007 opening the 2007 year in January as Japan's representative; this was very much an honor as it was enjoyable for her. Even after the significant privileges and eulogies bestowed unto Kanon, her style still reflects that of her essence ‚Äì contemporary classical. Tie-ins are also a part of Kanon's routine and plays in her overall promotion. Her song \\"Brand New Breeze\\" is being used in the opening sequence of the current anime Kiniro no Corda ~primo passo~. In the videogame industry, one of Kanon's most well- known endeavors is her collaboration with avex trax to aid in the completion of Namco's RPG Tales of Legendia, in which she sang as lead vocalist in a few of the games‚Äô tracks. In fact, visiting the provided link will direct you to the game's official site, where a sample of one of those songs can be heard. One song in particular from the Tales of Legendia Original Soundtrack, \\"Tori wa Naki, Boku wa Utau\\" (\\"The Bird Chirps, I Sing\\"), has captivated fans across the globe, thus increasing the number of listeners to what it is today. Career She debuted in 2003 with a mini album titled Alleluia -Piano & Voice-. As of year 2008, she already has 5 singles, 4 studio albums and 2 mini albums released and her latest appearance is at NHK Studio Park Kara Konnichiwa on March 19, 2008. =Collaborations= As for songs on her albums, she often does compositions herself, however occasionally collaborated with other composers such as Saint-Preux and Francesco Sartori.

Having started coaching before his 20s, he was the youngest manager in charge of a La Liga club, having taken over Salamanca at not yet 30 years of age. He also coached Oviedo, Tenerife, Zaragoza and Almer√≠a in the top-flight. Coaching career =Early years / Salamanca= Born in Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Lillo began coaching local Amaroz KE at just 16 and, four years later, he took charge of Tolosa CF in Tercera Divisi√≥n. He moved to CD Mirand√©s also in that level afterwards, and led the side to promotion to Segunda Divisi√≥n B in the 1988‚Äì89 season, as champions. Lillo spent the 1991‚Äì92 campaign at Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa, advocating a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. He became the youngest coach to attain the national coaching badge in Spain. Lillo made his name as a manager at UD Salamanca, joining the club in mid-1992 at the behest of its chairman Juan Jos√© Hidalgo. In his first season he finished second in the third level, narrowly missing out on promotion playoffs which he attained the following campaign without any major squad changes. This prompted reported interest from Real Valladolid, but the coach stayed until the end of 1995‚Äì96 as they competed in La Liga‚Äì this made him the youngest ever person to manage at the highest level, at only 29; after 28 games in charge, with Salamanca four points into the relegation zone, he was dismissed, but players and fans publicly opposed the sacking, supporting him in recognition of his achievements ‚Äì the team finished in last position, eleven points behind 21st- placed CP M√©rida. Lillo then had some spells in the top division: in the 1996‚Äì97 season he worked with Real Oviedo, but was fired before its closure due to poor results. He returned to management in February 1998 with CD Tenerife, helping them avoid relegation in his first year; the following campaign, however, he did not see out the year, being sacked after 15 matches as the team were ultimately relegated. After a year-and-a-half break, Lillo returned to take the reins of Real Zaragoza ‚Äì the team had qualified for the UEFA Cup the previous season, and manager Txetxu Rojo moved to Athletic Bilbao. He set about fulfilling the task of progressing in the European competition and repeating European qualification through the league but did not achieve this, being relieved of his duties after barely three months. =2000s= Lillo did not return to coaching quickly: he worked as a sports commentator for television channel Antena 3, during its 2002 FIFA World Cup coverage. From 2003 to 2005 he coached in Segunda Divisi√≥n, with Ciudad de Murcia and Terrassa FC, with little success (the Catalans were even relegated). Lillo went to Mexico in 2005, joining Dorados de Sinaloa and resigning mid-season (the club would also eventually drop down a division). He insinuated that the team he was battling against to avoid relegation, Televisa-owned San Luis FC, had gained unusual victories against more powerful opposition, which were also owned by the Televisa group; this caused much controversy in both the Mexican press and football league. Following the incident, Lillo spent the following two years away from football until he was appointed as the new head coach of Real Sociedad in April 2008, with the Basques in the second tier. Despite losing only once during his tenure he saw them fail to reach a promotion spot after finishing in sixth position, and was replaced by Mart√≠n Lasarte. In late December 2009, Lillo replaced Hugo S√°nchez at the helm of struggling UD Almer√≠a, just one place above the relegation zone. After helping the Andalusian team finish 13th, his link was renewed for a further season. After a 8‚Äì0 home loss against FC Barcelona on 20 November 2010, Lillo was dismissed with the side in the relegation zone, and eventually being relegated after four years. =Abroad= After several years of inactivity, Lillo was appointed at Colombian club Millonarios FC in December 2013. He was fired on 2 September the following year, after four consecutive Primera A losses and elimination in the Copa Sudamericana. On 8 October 2015, Lillo joined Jorge Sampaoli's staff at the Chile national team, being handed the role of handling the transition of players from the youth sides to the main squad. On 21 June 2017, after leaving Sevilla FC where he was working under the same manager, he was announced as the new coach Atl√©tico Nacional in place of Reinaldo Rueda; he resigned from his position at the latter in December, after being eliminated by Deportes Tolima in the quarter-finals of the Categor√≠a Primera A. Lillo switched continents again in September 2018, joining Japanese J1 League club Vissel Kobe who had recently signed high- profile compatriot Andr√©s Iniesta. He resigned the following April with the team in mid-table, despite financial backing from Rakuten and the presence of other veterans such Lukas Podolski and David Villa.

Nasir ad-Din and nearby al-Manara were in the same jurisdiction with 4,185 dunams of land, most of which was allocated to cereals.

A kilometer to the west is the shrine for another Muslim soldier who died fighting the Crusaders, named Sheikh al- Qaddumi. =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Nasir al Din had a population of 109, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Tiberias, p. 39 increasing in the 1931 census to 179, still all Muslims, in 35 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 84 During the British Mandate in Palestine, most of Nasir ad-Din's houses were scattered north-south, with no particular village plan. The inhabitants worked in agriculture and animal breeding. In the 1944/1945 statistics the population consisted of 90 Muslims, and together with the people of Al-Manara they had 4,185 dunams of land. Of this, 4,172 dunams of land were used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 173 =1948 War= On April 12, 1948, the 12th battalion of Israel's Golani Brigade captured Nasir ad-Din to cut off Tiberias from major Arab centers to the west (Nazareth and Lubya). The skirmish lasted four hours because the Haganah encountered unexpected local resistance, but eventually most of the inhabitants fled to Tiberias or Lubya ‚Äî British troops escorted villagers to Lubya. During the battle 22 Arabs were killed, six were wounded, and three were captured.Morris, 2004, p. 183 The civilian deaths included seven men, at least one woman, and a number of children. Two Haganah troops were also wounded. The capture and killing in Nasir ad-Din was a decisive factor for the flight of Arabs from Tiberias, and was a major demoralizing factor for Arab forces. All the houses were destroyed, and residents that remained were expelled on April 23.Morris, 1987, p. xv, 71.

It is the capital of Aravan District. Its population was 17,767 in 2009. Located on the Silk Road. Nearby are the Celestial Horses of Aravan, carved on a cliff face perhaps in the 1st century BC. They are thought to represent the 'blood-sweating horses' sought by the Chinese of the Han Dynasty. The petroglyphs have an important role in regional folklore and have become a pilgrimage site for Muslims in the Fergana Valley. There is a Sufi shrine. The Chil-Ustun cave system is 4 km away in the hills above the Aravan and Ak-Buura rivers. There is a similar cave system 20 km away. Neither is easily accessible. Celestial Horses of Aravan The Celestial Horses site itself is just near the local hospital when you are about to enter Aravan, on your right hand side when coming from Osh. The petroglyphs, who date from the first century BC, are carved on a near-vertical rock face next to a cemetery and represent solar symbols and the legendary Fergana horses which were much sought after by Chinese emperor Wu-Di in the second century BC. The site was archaeologically researched from the 1930s to the 1980s, and excavations at the foot of the rock produced evidence of animal sacrifice sites. Today, the horse carvings and nearby spring are still a local pilgrimage site and there is a small mosque. As a matter of fact, there are far more modern-day graffiti than ancient petroglyphs on the rock since a local superstition considers it as a luckbringer to have your name eternalized on the rocks. There are more petroglyphs near Camp Charbak. Chil-Ustun Chil-Ustun cave is located on the south-west of Kyrgyzstan, in 3,5 km from Aravan settlement. Nearby, in the limestone hills that make up the foothills of the Ak Bura and Aravan river basins lie the Chil-Ustun cave system that is named after the stalactites that can be found here, (Chil-Ustun is Tajik and means 40 columns). A huge entrance in the cave in the form of arc with a height of 15 m and a length of basement 25 m is located in the rocky group on almost plumb wall at the altitude of 1100 m. The cave consists of 3 halls of different volume, connected with corridors and narrow man holes. Tiff accumulated forms stalactites. Wandering kars of quaint forms of different colors from white and cream to dark-brown create a unique fairy interior of the hall. The length of the cave is 380 m. Dangi Canyon To the south of Aravan is the Dangi Canyon, which is dissected by the Aravan River. In the canyon are a series of caves. The main one is Azhiadar-Unkur and Tuya-Moyun Mountain.

It was originally developed by Data Dynamics, which was then acquired by GrapeCity. ActiveReports is a set of components and tools that facilitates the production of reports to display data in documents and web-based formats. It is written in managed C# code and allows Visual Studio programmers to leverage their knowledge of C# or Visual Basic.NET when programming with ActiveReports. Among the components included with ActiveReports are exports to file formats such as PDF, Excel, RTF, and Word. The main components are a Visual Studio integrated report designer, and an API that developers use to create customized reports from a variety of data sources. ActiveReports Standard Edition includes a Visual Query Designer, a customizable Windows Viewer control, and a WPF Viewer control. The integrated report designer handles three types of reports: * Section Reports with banded sections like the original ActiveReports (reminiscent of Microsoft Access reports) * Page Reports with a fixed layout for forms * RDL Reports with a continuous page layout like the original Data Dynamics Reports (uses Report Definition Language) The Professional Edition of ActiveReports includes the Standard Edition tools plus End-User Report Designer controls for desktop and web.

In 106 AD, Tiberius Claudius Maximus, of the Roman army, captured a fugitive Dacian king Decebalus, just moments after the king committed suicide in order not to be captured alive and suffer the same humiliation as Vercingetorix. Maximus cut Decebalus' head and right hand and brought them on a shield to Emperor Trajan, who was camped at that time at this fortification.

Lauder Business School (LBS) was founded in 2003 as a University of Applied Sciences with financial help from Ronald S. Lauder. There are currently app. 350 students enrolled in one undergraduate and two graduate programs. Lauder Business School is a fully recognized and government-funded University of Applied Sciences. LBS degree programs are in line with the Bologna requirements, accredited by the Agency for Quality Assurance and Accreditation Austria and listed with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy.  History and development  Main building In 2003 the Ronald Lauder Foundation established the Lauder Business School, under its President Ronald S. Lauder. Vienna as a location was chosen as a bridge between western and eastern traditions and to form an international University. The university combines American and European educational methods and is connected to the Harvard MOC (Microeconomics of Competitiveness) Network, which includes more than 100 major business schools from 65 different countries. Building on the key concepts of Professor Michael Porter the network provides scholarship, research and capacity building. During the first years of its existence, Lauder Business School offered an 8-semester Magister degree in International Marketing and Management, but since 2007 students have been accepted to two new programmes: a 6-semester Bachelor and a 4-semester Master's. At the moment the university offers one Bachelor in International Business Administration, a master's degree in International Management and Leadership and one in Strategic Finance and Business Analytics.  Campus  Main building Campus of the LBS New Building Mainbuilding of the LBS Lauder Business School has one campus, which includes a main building with classrooms, library, an administration building, auditoriums, a dining building and a student residence (in cooperation with Jewish Heritage Center). The main part which is located in the north has a size of 1.200 m¬≤ that provides enough space for lecture- and seminar rooms. Another 750 m¬≤ are used as office space. At the southern end of the park the student residence is located. They are all located in the D√∂bling district of Vienna, between Pyrkergasse and Hofzeile. These buildings (except one for the auditorium and dining room, which was built especially for the school) comprise a former palace of Maria Theresa, given to her by Charles IV and built by Nicol√≤ Pacassi. Later the building was owned by members of the Rothschild family and served as a hospital. The Bank Austria Creditanstalt Auditorium was built in 2003 and is dedicated to Gerhard Randa, former chairman of BA-CA. The conversion and extension of the baroque ensemble of Lauder Business School was done by Kuhn Malvezzi, a Berlin-based architecture bureau.Kuehn Malvezzi website entry on the LBS project  Educational programs  The university offers the following studies: * International Business Administration ‚Äì Bachelor (6 Semesters, 180 ECTS): The studies focus on an international, competitive education with a great part of practical application. The graduates will be prepared to work at international organizations or enterprises. * International Management and Leadership ‚Äì Master (4 Semesters, 120 ECTS): During this academic program students deepen their knowledge in applied business administration and increase their management and leadership skills. The graduates are trained to work in upper management positions in globally oriented companies. The Master centers on learning the foundations of executive management as for example decision- making and learning to strategize within complex structures. Students also receive a SAP beginner¬¥s certificate. * Strategic Finance and Business Analytics ‚Äì Master (4 Semesters, 120 ECTS): The program combines contemporary knowledge and concepts in the field of international finance and corporate strategy with the latest trends in business analytics. The curriculum is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the finance sector as well as the appropriate financial management of corporations in the non-financial industry. The university offers within their own language department classes in German, Hebrew, Chinese, Russian and Spanish. The students are required to choose at least one of those languages to develop intercultural competences.  International collaborations and research  Lauder Business School is a member of the Harvard MOC Network (Microeconomics of Competitiveness). Within this network it has established an Institute of Competitiveness (IoC), which focuses on urban competitiveness and on diversity challenges in international management. The IoC is the first of its kind in Austria. The LBS has diverse international partnerships with institutions or companies such as the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Bar-Ilan University, Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Ia»ôi in Romania, the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, the RHI AG, the Bank Austria Unicredit Group and the Vienna Insurance Group.  Integration of Judaism  The university itself is secular and there is no influence of religion on the business studies curriculum. But LBS is adjusted to Jews and people interested in Judaism. There are no classes on the major Jewish holidays, nor on Austrian bank holidays.

In classical mythology, the bident is a weapon associated with Hades (Pluto), the ruler of the underworld. Likewise, the three-pronged trident is the implement of his brother Poseidon (Neptune), god of the seas and earthquakes, and the lightning bolt, which superficially looks as if it has one prong, is a symbol of Zeus. Etymology The word 'bident' was brought into the English language before 1914,Webster's Online Dictionary, entry on bident. and is derived from the Latin bidentis, meaning \\"having two teeth (or prongs).\\" Historical uses Ancient Egyptians used a bident as a fishing tool, sometimes attached to a line and sometimes fastened with flight feathers. Two-pronged weapons mainly of bronze appear in the archaeological record of ancient Greece.Arthur Bernard Cook, Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion (Oxford University Press, 1924), vol. 2, p. 799. In Roman agriculture, the bidens (genitive bidentis) was a double-bladed drag hoeK.D. White, Roman Farming (Cornell University Press, 1970), p. 239. or two-pronged mattock,K.D. White, Agricultural Implements of the Roman World (Cambridge University Press, 1967, 2010), p. 11. although a modern distinction between \\"mattock\\" and \\"rake\\" should not be pressed.White, Agricultural Implements, p. 12. It was used to break up and turn ground that was rocky and hard.Pliny, Natural History 17.54; White, Agricultural Implements, p. 19. The bidens is pictured on mosaics and other forms of Roman art, as well as tombstones to mark the occupation of the deceased.White, Agricultural Implements, pp. vii, viii, 11, 51. In mythology Roman-era mosaics show the bident for hare hunting (Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily, ca. 300 AD) The spear of Achilles is said by a few sources to be bifurcated.By Lesches of Lesbos (7th century BC) in the Little Iliad (Ilias parva), frg. 5 in the edition of Kinkel, as preserved by the scholiast to Pindar, Nemean Ode 6.85 and the scholiast to the Iliad 16.142. Also in the Classical period by Aeschylus in the fragmentary Nereids (Nereides), frg. 152 in the second edition of Nauck; and by Sophocles in the Lovers of Achilles (Achilleos erastai), frg. 156 (Nauck2 = 152 in the edition of Jebb), as cited by Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 799. Achilles had been instructed in its use by Peleus, who had in turn learned from the centaur Chiron. The implement may have associations with Thessaly. A black-figured amphora from Corneto (Etruscan Tarquinia) depicts a scene from the hunt for the Calydonian boar, part of a series of adventures that took place in the general area. Peleus is accompanied by Castor, who is attacking the boar with a two-pronged spear.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 799. A bronze trident found in an Etruscan tomb at Vetulonia seems to have had an adaptable center prong that could be removed for use as a bident.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 1225, with images of Zeus wielding lightning bolts, and citing Milani, Studi e materiali di archeologia e numismatica (Florence, 1905), (vol. 3, p. 85. A kylix found at Vulci in ancient Etruria was formerly interpreted as depicting Pluto (Greek: Œ†ŒªŒøœçœÑœâŒΩ Plouton) with a bident. A black-bearded man holding a peculiarly two-pronged instrument reaches out in pursuit of a woman, thought to be Persephone. The vase was subjected to improper reconstruction, however, and the couple are more likely Poseidon and Aethra.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 800‚Äì801. The kylix from the workshop of Brygos. On Lydian coins that show Plouton abducting Persephone in his four-horse chariot, the god holds his characteristic scepter, the ornamented point of which has sometimes been interpreted as a bident.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 801. Other visual representations of the bident on ancient objects appear to have been either modern-era reconstructions, or in the possession of figures not securely identified as the ruler of the underworld.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 802. The Cambridge ritualist A.B. Cook saw the bident as an implement that might be wielded by Jupiter, the chief god of the Roman pantheon, in relation to Roman bidental ritual, the consecration of a place struck by lightning by means of a sacrificial sheep, called a bidens because it was of an age to have two teeth.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 805‚Äì806. In the hands of Jupiter (also known as Jove, Etruscan Tinia), the trident or bident thus represents a forked lightning bolt. In ancient Italy, thunder and lightning were read as signs of divine will, wielded by the sky god Jupiter in three forms or degrees of severity (see manubia). The Romans drew on Etruscan traditions for the interpretation of these signs. A tile found at Urbs Salvia in Picenum depicts an unusual composite Jove, \\"fairly bristling with weapons\\": a lightning bolt, a bident, and a trident, uniting the realms of sky, earth, and sea, and representing the three degrees of ominous lightning (see also Summanus).Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 803, with image on p. 804. Cook regarded the trident as the Greek equivalent of the Etruscan bident, each representing a type of lightning used to communicate the divine will; since he accepted the Lydian origin of the Etruscans, he traced both forms to the same Mesopotamia source.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 806. The later notion that the ruler of the underworld wielded a trident or bident can perhaps be traced to a line in the Hercules Furens (\\"Hercules Enraged\\") of Seneca. Dis (the Roman equivalent of Greek Plouton) uses a three-pronged spear to drive off Hercules as he attempts to invade Pylos. Seneca also refers to Dis as the \\"Infernal Jove\\"Inferni Iovis (genitive case), Hercules Furens line 47, in the prologue spoken by Juno. or the \\"dire Jove\\",Diro Iovi, line 608 of Hercules Furens; compare Vergil, Aeneid 4.638, Iove Stygio, the \\"Jove of the Styx\\". Fitch, Seneca's Hercules Furens, p. 156. the Jove who gives dire or ill omens (dirae), just as in the Greek tradition, Hades is sometimes identified as a \\"chthonic Zeus.\\" That the trident and bident might be somewhat interchangeable is suggested by a Byzantine scholiast, who mentions Poseidon being armed with a bident.Codex Augustanus, note to Euripides' Phoenician Women, line 188, as cited by Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 806, note 6. In art Council of the gods from the Loggia di Psiche, Villa Farnesina, with Pluto holding a bident and Neptune a trident In Western art of the Middle Ages, classical underworld figures began to be depicted with a pitchfork.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 803. Early Christian writers identified the classical underworld with Hell, and its denizens as demons or devils.Friedrich Solmsen, \\"The Powers of Darkness in Prudentius' Contra Symmachum: A Study of His Poetic Imagination,\\" Vigiliae Christianae 19.4 (1965), pp. 238, 240‚Äì248 et passim. In the Renaissance, the bident became a conventional attribute of Pluto in art. Pluto, with Cerberus at his side, is shown holding the bident in the mythological ceiling mural painted by Raphael's workshop for the Villa Farnesina (the Loggia di Psiche, 1517‚Äì18). In a scene depicting a council of the gods, the three brothers Jove, Pluto, and Neptune are grouped closely, with a Cupid standing before them. Neptune holds the trident. Elsewhere in the loggia, a putto holds a bident.Richard Stemp, The Secret Language of the Renaissance: Decoding the Hidden Symbolism of Italian Art (Duncan Baird, 2006), p. 114; Clare Robertson et al., Drawings by the Carracci from British Collections (Ashmolean Museum, 1996), p. 78. Perhaps influenced by this work, Agostino Carracci had depicted Pluto with a bident in a preparatory drawing for his painting Pluto (1592), in which the god holds instead his characteristic key.Robertson et al., Drawings by the Carracci from British Collections, pp. 78‚Äì79. In Caravaggio's Giove, Nettuno e Plutone (ca. 1597), a ceiling mural based on alchemical allegory, Pluto-- with his 3-headed dog, Cerberus --holds a bident. (Immediately beside him, Neptune is shown with a trident. Some writers have confused the two figures; Neptune's identity is confirmed by his embrace of the Hippocamp -- the \\"sea horse\\" with fins for forelegs, and whose markings appear to repeat the trident in a stylized, perhaps symbolic, form.)

As the only permanent officer of the Alumni Association, Hodgkins' job was to keep the living alumni interested in the school. He created various activities and outings for alumni to participate in, in support of the University, and in 1892 Hodgkins prepared a historical catalogue of the University that covered the George Washington University's first seventy years. Hodgkins served the Alumni Association for more than twenty-five years. In addition to all his work at the George Washington University, Howard Lincoln Hodgkins was involved in a number of ‚Äúextracurricular activities. He was initiated into the DC Alpha chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity on campus which is still present today. He worked with the Washington Society of Engineers, served as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was a member of the American Physical Society, the American mathematical society, and the Washington Philosophical Society in addition to serving as the special computer of the National Almanac Office of the Navy Department from 1882 until 1892. Hodgkins died on February 13, 1931 in Washington DC at age 69.

Lambda Foundation is governed by a national Board of Directors. History For many years, Lambda operated as a spin-off project from an unincorporated club, Lambda Business and Professional Group. The Lambda Business and Professional Group sought charitable status and eventually underwent a name change to Lambda Foundation for Excellence, and its fundraiser, Wilde About Sappho, was one of Canada's largest literary activities. After establishing five scholarships in partnership with five universities, Lambda incorporated under the name Lambda Literary and Scholarship Foundation - Lambda Foundation being the short version. Lambda Foundation received charitable status in 2003, its activities having grown into education and research. It has recently changed its name to Lambda Scholarship Foundation Canada but is still known in short form as Lambda Foundation/Fondation Lambda. Scholarship Programme =Universities= Lambda Foundation's Scholarship Programme is the first Canadian series of national, annual university scholarships in LGBT research in all fields. To date, scholarships have been established on eight university campuses: Carleton University, Universit√© de Montr√©al, Guelph University, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa, University of Victoria and Laurentian University. There is also a Doctor Gary Gibson Award at Saint's Paul's Hospital Foundation/UBC in Vancouver, and the Friends of Lambda scholarship at the University of Saskatchewan, College of Law (Foster Prize in Human Rights). Each university selects candidates and projects, based on academic merit and relevance to the LGBT community. Students meeting these criteria are welcome to apply to the participating university, regardless of sexual orientation, gender or any other grounds. =Schools= Expanding beyond universities, Lambda worked with local community leaders in 2007 to establish awards for high school students at Gulf Islands Secondary School on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia. = Scholarship/award recipients = Lambda Foundation scholarships have been awarded to a wide range of students in arts, literature, social sciences and other sciences, professional schools and secondary schools. The awards highlight the value of gay and lesbian studies, to both the LGBT community and more broadly. A listing of recipients can be found at the Lambdafondationlambda.com website. Other forms of support With the assistance of the Canada Council for the Arts and Carleton University, Lambda sponsored a Writer-in-Residence, Ivan Coyote, at Carleton University during 2007-2008.

Its typical habitat is sandy plains near coral reefs and it is able to change its colouring to make it well-camouflaged in this environment. It is sometimes known as the peacock flounder, a name also given to the closely related Bothus mancus from the Indo-Pacific. Description Close-up of head Bothus lunatus has a laterally flattened body and orientates itself so that its right side is underneath and its left side is uppermost. Both eyes are on this upper surface and project on short thick stalks. The body shape is rounded and the dorsal and anal fins nearly surround the body. The former has 92 to 99 soft rays and the latter 71 to 76. The pectoral fins are long and often erect. An average adult length is about , with a maximum length of . The upper surface of this flounder is some shade between grey, brown and tan with small blue spots and circular blue markings, the head and fins also being spotted and speckled with blue. There are two or three rather diffuse dark patches on the lateral line. The fish can vary its background colour to make it closely resemble that of its surroundings and thus camouflage itself as it lies on the seabed. Fish in this genus are able to change their colouring in two to eight seconds. Distribution and habitat Bothus lunatus is found in tropical and subtropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Its range extends from Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda to Brazil, but it is absent from the Gulf of Mexico. It also occurs in the Gulf of Guinea and Ascension Island. It is usually found between deep but may occur as deep as . Its typical habitat is sandy areas near coral reefs, in seagrass meadows or near mangroves. It is also sometimes found over rubble or hard substrates and is one of the commonest flounders near coral reefs. Behaviour Bothus lunatus is well-camouflaged as it lies on the sandy seabed, often partially submerged in the sediment. It is more visible when it swims, which it does in a series of short glides, remaining close to the rippled sand contours of the ocean floor. In the Caribbean, a small octopus, Macrotritopus defilippi, mimics these bursts of swimming activity, a behaviour which might afford it protection from predators large enough to take a bite out of a soft-bodied octopus but too small to tackle a rigid flounder. In the West Indies, Bothus lunatus largely feeds on fishes, which make up 85.7% of its diet by volume, and particularly on herrings in the genus Jenkinsia and the bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus). Another 11.4% of its diet consists of mantis shrimps and 2.9% of octopuses. Bothus lunatus is believed to be an ambush predator, lying concealed on the seabed before darting out to catch any unwary prey that moves too close.

It was established 28 March 2007, though it has been offering training for more than 60 years in different status. It is situated on Observation Hill close to University of Dar es Salaam, in which it was a constituent college from 1996-2007, when it was known as University College of Lands and Architectural Studies‚ÄîUCLAS. Prior being part of University of Dar es Salaam, Ardhi University was known as Ardhi Institute with history extending to mid-1950s.Ardhi University website Today, academic activities at the university are generated in four schools as follows: 1\\\\. School of Architecture, Construction Economics and Management (SACEM) 2\\\\. School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics (SERBI) 3\\\\. School of Environmental Science and Technology (SEST) 4\\\\. School of Spatial Planning and Social Science (SSPSS) The number of academic staff with doctoral degrees has increased from three in 1996 to 43 in 2008.  History  The university was established under University Act No 7 of 2005, and came into being after the signing of Ardhi University Charter by the President of United Republic of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete on 28 March 2007. The roots of Ardhi University can be traced back to pre-independence days when a Surveying Training School offering technician certificate courses in land surveying was established in Dar es Salaam. In 1974, the name was changed to Ardhi Institute and its range of courses expanded to include building design and building economics. In the early 1980s, the public health engineering course (later renamed ‚Äòenvironmental engineering‚Äô) was introduced. In 1996 the Ardhi Institute became a constituent college of the University of Dar es Salaam, and ten years later was granted autonomy as Ardhi University. During the decade of association with the University of Dar es Salaam, the Ardhi Institute grew dramatically: the number of academic programmes on offer increased from six to 39, while the number of students grew from 400 to 1,400. In 1979, the Centre for Housing Studies was established as joint project between the governments of Tanzania and the Netherlands. The centre has now grown into the Institute of Human Settlement Studies, which is involved in the ‚Äòregularisation of informal settlements‚Äô, with which Dar es Salaam is plentifully endowed.SARUA  Academics  The university currently offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the following schools and an institution: * School of Architecture, Construction Economics and Management (SACEM) * School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics (SERBI) * School of Environmental Science and Technology (SEST) * School of Spatial Planning and Social Science (SSPSS) * Institute of Human Settlement Studies (IHSS)  References  Public universities in Tanzania Universities in Dar es Salaam Educational institutions established in 2007 2007 establishments in Tanzania Association of African Universities ","title":"Ardhi University"},{"id":"20606326","text":"CBDN may refer to: * CBDN (AM), a radio rebroadcaster (560 AM) licensed to Dawson, Yukon Territory, Canada, rebroadcasting CFWH * CBDN-FM, a radio rebroadcaster (104.9 FM) licensed to Dawson, Yukon Territory, Canada, rebroadcasting CBU-FM ","title":"CBDN"},{"id":"20606419","text":"The Calico Acts (1700, 1721) banned the import of most cotton textiles into England, followed by the restriction of sale of most cotton textiles. It was a form of economic protectionism, largely in response to India (particularly Bengal), which dominated world cotton textile markets at the time. The Acts were a precursor to the Industrial Revolution, when Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading textile manufacturer in the 19th century.  Context  The English East India Company introduced Britain to cheap calico and chintz cloth after the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for calico, by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected, with parliament petitioned, the EIC offices stormed by a mob, the fashion conscious assaulted for wearing imported cloth, making the calico question one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like China and India. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. So, dissatisfied with the outcome of the first act, in 1721 Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time, prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread Fustian and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of raw cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they wished to compete with the EIC for the British cotton market. The acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, till the 1840s.

Environmental ecology An agroecosystem exists amid contexts including climate, soil, plant genetics, government policies, and the personal beliefs and predilections of the agriculturalist. Not only are these contexts too numerous to list in their entirety for any agroecosystem, but their interactions are so complex it is impossible to perfectly characterize a system, let alone predict the effect a given perturbation will have on the whole. At the same time, all of these contexts are dynamic, albeit at wildly diverging time scales, so the ecology of contexts for an agroecosystem is fundamentally mutable. An awareness of the ecology of contexts is helpful for agroecologists, as the nearly axiomatic acceptance dynamic, and thereby unperfectable, nature of agroecosystems precludes the often damaging notion of a best or ideal approach to agroecosystem management as well as an awareness of the complexity of the response that can result from any perturbation of the system. This concept of the ecology of contexts provides a useful epistemological device for understanding agroecosystems. This dual relationship of an entity in an ecology of contexts underscores the ecological analogy, with its emphasis on holonic interactions.

It is also used in Bhutan in the same way. \\"Tashi delek\\" is associated with Losar, the festival of the lunisolar new year. Origin and meaning Tashi (, ) means \\"auspicious\\" and delek (, , or Deleg, Deleh) means \\"fine\\" or \\"well\\". It is difficult and perhaps impossible to translate properly into English. Different authors render it as \\"Blessings and good luck\\" or \\"May all auspicious signs come to this environment\\". Usage \\"Tashi delek\\" is traditionally used as part of a larger invocation on Losar. With the Dalai Lama's self-deportation and creation of the Tibetan diaspora, exile authorities promoted the use of \\"tashi delek\\" as an all-purpose greeting which could be easily picked up by foreign sponsors. Students of the exile school system are taught that this usage of \\"tashi delek\\" has roots in premodern Tibet, and that Chinese Tibetans' exclusive usage of \\"tashi delek\\" for New Year's is corrupt. Tour operators have promoted the phrase, along with khata scarves and prayer flags, as essentialized and commodifiable aspects of Tibetan culture, a fact that has caused resentment among some religious Tibetans. \\"Tashi Delek\\" is the name of a website that provides information on the nation of Bhutan and promotes Tourism.

Immediately preceding these verses, he had commissioned them to evangelize the Israelites with his authority. As soon as he did this, he moved to telling them of the persecutions they will be subjected to for him, before moving to a description of the world in light of their teaching. Jesus with the twelve apostles 10:16 Necessity of cunning and innocence \\"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.\\" Inserting 'behold' into the midst of his commission of the Twelve Apostles draws attention to what Jesus begins to say here.Donald Hagner. Matthew 1-13: Word Biblical Commentary (Dallas: Word Books, 1993) 276. It marks off this section as distinct from the preceding part of his instruction to the disciples. After drawing the attention of the disciples with 'behold', Jesus says, literally, 'I, even I, send you...'.Robert E. Morosco. '\\"Matthew‚Äôs Formation of a Commissioning Type-Scene out of the Story of Jesus' Commissioning of the Twelve\\" in Journal of Biblical Literature 103:4 (December 1984): 539-556, 550. Though in a different tense, this is a quotation of the Septuagint reading of Exodus 3:12, where God commissioned Moses to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. This would have brought to the disciples' attention that they were being commissioned to be the leaders of God's people, as was Moses. He sends them as sheep among wolves, which brings to mind the messianic time envisioned at Isaiah 11:6, which says that the ‚Äòwolf shall dwell with the lamb‚Äô.Daniel J. Harrington, The Gospel of Matthew: Sacra Pagina Series. (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press, 1991), 144 Referring to them as sheep also highlights the danger they will face in their mission.Hagner, 277. It draws attention to Jesus‚Äô community as the true Israel, because Jewish literature had traditionally used sheep and wolf imagery of Israel and the nations. Because this verse follows on Jesus sending the twelve to the Israelites exclusively, the Jews hostile to his kingdom are now implicitly cast as wolves.W. D. Davies and Dale Allison, Jr., A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel According to Saint Matthew. (Edinburgh: T&T; Clark, 1991), 181. When he tells them to be as wise as serpents, this refers back to the Genesis story of Eden, where the serpent is called ‚Äòsubtle‚Äô, but the Greek is the same both here and there (at Gen 3:1).Harrington, 144. This wisdom entails avoiding danger, but only in ways consistent with their mission.John Nolland, The Gospel of Matthew: A Commentary on the Greek Text (Bletchley: The Paternoster Press, 2005), 423. Their wisdom is to be for self-preservation, rather than doing harm to others as did the serpent of Genesis.R.T. France. The Gospel of Matthew. (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2007), 391. Augustine of Hippo saw this as an analogy in which Jesus was calling Christians to offer their whole body to persecutors rather than their head, as serpents do (they curl up their body around their head to protect it).St Augustine, De doctrina christiana, II.xvi.23. R.P.H. Green, trans. On Christian Teaching (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 44. This is emphasized by pairing the commandment to be like serpents with a commandment to be like doves. Commanding them to be innocent as doves tells the disciples to have pure intentions‚Äîelsewhere it is a characteristic of those with integrity.John Nolland, 423. The literal meaning of the Greek word translated ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô is ‚Äòunmixed‚Äô.W.D. Davies and Dale Allison, Jr., 181. Elsewhere in the New Testament it is used in a meaning related to the simplicity of children, and it is meant to instruct the twelve that they are to set themselves wholly upon the mission entrusted to them by Jesus. This further shows that the wisdom of snakes, and the innocence of doves, while different, are not at odds. Because doves were used at the time to symbolize Israel,David Hill, ed. The Gospel of Matthew: New Century Bible (London: Oliphants, 1972), 187. the text further points to the twelve as the centre of the true Israel. Pairing the statement on snakes with one about doves seems to have been a trope in Jesus‚Äô time. Though the wisdom of the serpent has a positive connotation, it is also meant to contrast with the innocence of doves. 10:17 Persecution by Jews Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in their synagogues In this verse the wolves are seen in a vague way as ‚Äòmen‚Äô, or ‚Äòpeople‚Äô. However, it seems to point to persecution from Jewish officials, because the rest of the verse refers to judicial sentences carried out in the Jewish world of the day. Some commentators see this as a redaction in which Matthew is writing in light of a ‚Äòserious cleavage‚Äô between Judaism and Christianity, because the twelve will be flogged in ‚Äòtheir‚Äô synagogues (presumably in opposition to the idea of synagogues of Jewish Christians or synagogues shared by both groups). Hagner further sees it as a redaction because the sentence continues in v. 18 in reference to witnessing to the nations, which would have been the case in the later Church, but not at the time of this speech of Jesus. In contrast, R. T. France sees that Jesus did speak these words here, and that he was looking to the future of the community's life from this early point. Similarly, Davies and Allison see this as evidence that Matthew's community continued to be close to the Jewish communities, because this verse indicates that they were submitting to the authority of the (Jewish) synagogues. Overall, Matthew's gospel is suited to a community closely related to Judaism, because of its messianism and emphasis on the covenant of Abraham.M. Tenney, New Testament Survey (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing: 1985), 150. ‚ÄòCouncils‚Äô is literally ‚Äòsanhedrins‚Äô, and necessarily refers to local governing bodies rather than to the national Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, because here the Greek is in plural form.R.T. France, 388. ‚ÄòSynagogues‚Äô is translated as ‚Äòassemblies‚Äô by France because he sees a difference in their function from the earlier uses of the word in Matthew, as meaning a location of worship and teaching. This points to the idea that ‚Äòsynagogue‚Äô might refer to a grouping of the community, rather than a building used for worship. Leon Morris points out that synagogues were places not only of worship and teaching, but also of trials and the administration of justice.Leon Morris, The Gospel According to Matthew: PNTC (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992), 253. That \\"synagogue\\" could refer to an assembly rather than a building, there may be a connection between being delivered up to councils and being flogged in the synagogues, as seen in the case of the apostles in Acts 5: being set before the Sanhedrin (v. 27) and then beaten (v. 40). This flogging was the well-known 39 lashes given for transgressions, in the eyes of the sanhedrin, of the Mosaic law. Nolland's belief lends itself to this connection, in that his causative translation of the verb linking councils and synagogues (‚Äòcouncils, and will have you flogged in...‚Äô)John Nolland, 423 makes a clearer connection between the action in each group. Also, Davies and Allison see that ‚Äòin‚Äô their synagogues could be translated ‚Äòby‚Äô or ‚Äòthrough‚Äô their synagogues.W.D. Davies and Dale Allison, Jr., 183. These points strengthen the idea that the synagogue could refer to an official gathering of the community, similar to the Sanhedrin, that would have exercised the authority of Deuteronomistic punishments. 10:18 The apostles' mission to the Gentile rulers and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. This verse moves the Twelve Apostles' mission from being restricted to the Jews, and points toward their mission to the Gentiles. Until this point in Matthew's gospel Jesus‚Äô ministry had been in Galilee. But at the time, Galilee had no Roman governor or king. (R.T. France distinguishes between kings and tetrarchs, which was the title of the region's Herod Antipas.)R.T. France, 392. On this basis, commentators see v. 18 as a great leap from the following verse. However, something that France notes but does not seem interested in, is that four chapters later, Matthew refers to Herod as ‚Äòking‚Äô. This suggests that we should say that at the time Galilee did in fact have a king; and if Galilee had a king at the time Jesus said this, this verse is not so revolutionary as some make it out to be. Davies and Allison read the verse so that it does not need to envision action of the Twelve outside Palestine, because there were plenty of Roman officials in the land to whom they could witness.W.D. Davies and Dale Allison Jr., 184. The term translated \\"governors\\" is ·º°Œ≥ŒµŒºœåŒΩŒ±œÇ (hƒìgemonas), simply meaning \\"leaders\\", while \\"kings\\" is Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·øñœÇ (basileis). Therefore, it does stand in marked contrast to the beginning of Jesus‚Äô commission, telling the twelve not to approach the Samaritans, much less the nations. The plurality of governors and kings suggests the situation of the Church after Peter's vision in Acts. Morris believes that this shows a shift in Jesus‚Äô meaning, from talking earlier about the immediate mission he was sending His twelve out for in Galilee, to now and following talking about their later missions to the Gentiles. This is because their restricted mission to the people of Israel would not have brought them into contact with the governors and kings of whom he spoke.Leon Morris, 254. ‚ÄòTo bear testimony before them‚Äô is problematic because it is unclear from the Greek syntax to whom ‚Äòthem‚Äô refers. It could refer to the kings and governors, to the councils and synagogues, or to both. This passage is ‚Äòtaken primarily from Mk 13.9-13‚Äô,W.D. Davies and Dale Allison Jr., 181. and in that version, ‚Äòand the Gentiles‚Äô does not follow, ‚Äòbefore them‚Äô. However, it is also unclear to whom ‚Äòthem‚Äô refers in that passage. This fact, coupled with the fact that bearing witness to governors and kings would have been simultaneously bearing witness to the Gentiles over whom they ruled, suggests that ‚Äòthem‚Äô refers to the councils and synagogues. It would have been redundant for Matthew the Evangelist to add on ‚Äòand the Gentiles‚Äô to his source-text, if he felt that ‚Äòthem‚Äô referred in any way to the kings and governors. The fact that the twelve will be ‚Äòdragged‚Äô before the nations‚Äô rulers reminds the reader of how the twelve will be as sheep among wolves. 10:19-20 Providence of words When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Verse 19 connects explicitly to verse 17; the verb in the Greek for ‚Äòdeliver you up‚Äô is the same in both (as well as in verse 21).Donald Hagner, 277. This returns attention to the twelve in front of the Jewish officials, because this verb is not used of the twelve being brought before the Gentile officials. Had Matthew wanted it to refer to the twelve before the Gentile officials as well, he could have used the verb there as well, instead of ‚Äòdragged‚Äô. ‚ÄòDo not be anxious‚Äô is the same language as is used in 6:25-34. The attitude of trust the twelve have when they are delivered up is to be the same attitude of trust they have in God in relation to bodily provision. Matthew makes his version of this speech more intimate than that of his source, the Gospel of Mark, by saying that who will speak is ‚Äòthe Spirit of your Father‚Äô (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ†ŒΩŒµ·ø¶ŒºŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ†Œ±œÑœÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ, to Pneuma tou Patros hym≈çn) rather than ‚Äòthe Holy Spirit.‚Äô Referring to God as Father of the listeners provides an additional connection between this passage and 6:25-34. It also reminds the twelve that their true family is not their earthly family, which they soon are to hear will deliver them up.W.D. Davies and Dale Allison Jr., 186. The outpouring of the Spirit on the disciples associates their ministry with that of Jesus, as an extension of it, because in Matthew's gospel references to the Spirit are only in relation to his operation in Jesus‚Äô ministry.John Nolland, 425. Davies and Allison suggest that the image of the Spirit speaking through the twelve is an eschatological marker, a marker of the end-times, because Jews expected a special outpouring of God's Spirit in the latter days. 10:21 Persecution by one's own family Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death Jesus‚Äô view of the situation to come for the Church is worse than at the beginning of this passage. Now when the twelve are delivered up it will be by their own kinsmen, and the penalty is to be capital punishment rather than flogging. The escalation of response to the mission of the twelve again suggests a larger audience than merely Galilee,R.T. France, 393. and Davies and Allison say that it is clearly an expression of the post-Easter situation of the twelve. The sense of eschatology is heightened because this verse alludes to Micah 7:6, which is eschatological in theme.Francis Andersen and David Freedman, Micah: The Anchor Bible (New York: Doubleday, 2000), 562. Such conflict within families was seen as ‚Äòa sign of the End‚Äô in Jewish apocrypha.David Hill, 189. The ‚Äòdeliver[ing] up‚Äô and being put to death point to execution by authorities.R.T. France, 393-4. This is in continuity with the echo of verses 17 and 19, which dealt with being accused before the sanhedrins. The same word is used in 10:4 of Judas Iscariot‚Äôs betrayal of Jesus.Leon Morris, 255. 10:22 Necessity of endurance and you will be hated by all for my name‚Äôs sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. This verse is the climax of the increasingly bleak-looking picture of the persecutions to be endured by the twelve. ‚ÄòFor my name‚Äôs sake‚Äô echoes ‚Äòfor my sake‚Äô in verse 18.John Nolland, 426. The second half of this verse is unclear. Both ‚Äòto the end‚Äô and ‚Äòsaved‚Äô can have multiple meanings. Elsewhere in Matthew ‚Äòto the end‚Äô can refer to the destruction of the Temple in 70, the Second Coming of Jesus, the end of persecution, the close of the age, or the end of an individual's life. France notes that there is no context to say for certain to what it refers here, and opts to view it as being as long as necessary to be saved, with reference to the rest of the verse. Thus he does not believe it to refer to any particular historical or eschatological event. Hill rejects this, saying that ‚Äòto the end‚Äô refers not to death by martyrdom, nor to the close of the age, but asserts, with no apparent reason, that it refers to the end of persecution. Davies and Allison examine the possible meanings, and how they are expressed elsewhere in Scripture, and believe that ‚Äòto the end‚Äô refers to the parousia (Second Coming).W.D. Davies and Dale Allison Jr., 187. France notes that ‚Äòsaved‚Äô is used several different ways in Matthew: being saved from physical death or disease, corporate salvation from sins, a disciple's life being saved by losing his life, or it can be co-identified with entering the kingdom of God.R.T. France, 394-5. Because he had already as much as told them they would be martyred (verse 20), Jesus would not be speaking here of salvation from death or disease. His meaning had to lie among the more spiritual meanings of the word. Hagner says that to be saved is to ‚Äòenter finally into the blessed peace promised to the participants in the kingdom.‚ÄôDonald Hagner, 278. The Catechism of the Catholic Church uses this verse to orient Catholics towards the hope of obtaining salvation.Catechism of the Catholic Church. (New York: Doubleday, 1997), 1821. 10:23 The apostles are to go from town to town When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes. Going through all the towns of Israel may refer either to the twelve running out of cities to which they can flee, or to the completion of Israel's evangelization.Donald Hagner, 279. However, because the two are so closely aligned‚Äîone will occur when the other does‚Äîit is little matter which one is read. The Son of man is a figure borrowed from Daniel 7, and its use by Jesus is self-referential.R.T. France, 396. Daniel 7:13 says, '...there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.' The coming of the Son of man has been taken to refer to the parousia, the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, or some great event of early Christian history (e.g., the Resurrection, the Ascension, or Pentecost). The parousia is rejected as too far removed from the Galilean setting of Jesus‚Äô public ministry, where he spoke these words to the twelve.R.T. France, 395-6 Hagner rejects the early defining moments of Christianity as being too early for the persecution of the preceding verses to have developed. Working from the background of ‚ÄòSon of man‚Äô in Daniel 7, where the figure approaches God, Morris does look to either the Resurrection or Ascension as the meaning of the mysterious phrase. He notes that at the time there was still work to be done in Israel.Leon Morris, 257. This is less natural than Hagner's interpretation, because it was not until after Pentecost that the twelve were persecuted as described in verses 17-22. Morris seems to have forgotten that he made this same point‚Äîjust a few verses earlier, Jesus had shifted into speaking about the situation of the Church after he was to leave. There seems to be nothing here to indicate that Jesus has reverted to talking about the mission of the disciple while they were still accompanied by himself. Hagner interprets the coming of the Son of man as referring to the destruction of the Temple‚Äîthe coming of the Son of man as his judgement upon Israel. This time frame allowed for a development of the kind of persecution described in the earlier verses. Thus Hagner reads the verses as meaning that the twelve's exclusive mission to Israel will not end before 70, when the focus of salvation history would shift from the Jews to the Gentiles.Donald Hagner, 280. Giblin moves away from seeing the coming of the Son of man in temporal terms. Rather than reading the verse to mean that the coming of the Son of man stops short the mission of going through the towns of Israel, he translates it as meaning that the Son of man's coming completes and fulfills this mission.Charles Giblin, S.J. ‚ÄòTheological Perspective and Matthew 10:23b‚Äô, Theological Studies, 29 (1968): 639. ‚ÄòWhat the text has in view is not a single historical event as such but a theological understanding of the mission of the Church.‚ÄôCharles Giblin, 641. The sayings are addressed to the whole church, because it is apostolic. France reaches a similar conclusion to that of Giblin.R.T. France, 396-7. He notes that in Daniel 7, the coming of the Son of man is to God, and there is no indication of a coming to earth. The verb used in the LXX Daniel 7 and in allusions to it is distinct from parousia, so Matthew does not seem to want to convey parousia when speaking of the coming of the Son of man. France reads the coming of the Son of man as not a particular historical event, but as Jesus‚Äô enthronement, vindication, and empowering. This seems to lead the reader towards the Resurrection or Ascension, but he had earlier said that we are not to think of it as a particular point in time. It was begun at the resurrection, but continues throughout the Church's history until the Last Judgment. Just as inserting ‚Äòbehold‚Äô at verse 16 to mark the beginning of the section, so Matthew marks the end of the section with ‚Äòtruly, I say to you‚Äô‚Äîthis is parallel to the end of the prior section, at 10:15.John Nolland, 427. The parallel here with verse 15, and at 16 with verses 5-6 (sheep), draws a strong connection between the two passages. Ulrich Luz identifies ‚Äòdeliver up‚Äô as the theme of this passage, which serves to distinguish it from the mission section of verses 5-15.Ulrich Luz. James E. Crouch, trans. Matthew 8-20: A Commentary, (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2001), 84.

The image is in Gothic style, from approximately the 13th century, carved in alabaster. It was an exceptional witness to the historic events of the Discovery of the Americas. Before it, prayed men like Columbus, The Pinzon Brothers, and the men who participated in the first expeditions of Columbus and in subsequent ones that departed to the Americas from this zone. Likewise, in their visits to the Franciscan monastery, many prostrated themselves, among others, Hern√°n Cort√©s, Gonzalo de Sandoval (who died in the monastery and was buried in it) and Francisco Pizarro. Although it was dated towards the late 13th century or the early 14th century, included in the popular tradition and the legends is an ancient codex of 1714 from Fray Felipe de Santiago; it has been given an apostolic origin and some notable incarnations, like her apparition in the sea after the completion of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania among the nets of some fishermen from Huelva. The image is a patron of both the monastery and the city of Palos de la Frontera, in which several diverse religious and civil acts are celebrated in the month of August in its honor culminating with the typical Andalusian romeria celebrated in the environment of La R√°bida in the last weekend of that month. Because of the various vicissitudes suffered by the image it has been repaired and restored on various occasions, however the carving largely conserves the original work. On June 14, 1993 it was crowned by the Pope John Paul II, who named it ¬´Mother of Spain and the Americas ()¬ª. The Godparents of honor for the coronation where the kings of Spain, who delegated to their daughter, Infanta Cristina. In the acts of this celebration she was also named, in part through the town hall. ¬´Pertutual Honorary Mayor of Palos de la Frontera ()¬ª. The image and La R√°bida The current Image. =Description= The Image is a sculpture representative of the Virgin Mary built in alabaster, it stands 54 centimeters tall. The body of the sculpture is one piece, although with some minor attachments in the posterior due to some imperfections suffered during its history; it rests atop a 5 centimeter pedestal with elongated lines. Its face is also elongated with the hair combed naturally, and the hands a bit exaggerated with respect to the body. The dress is carved to resemble a tunic with a modest neckline which descends in parallel folds, regular and well carved, until it reaches the pedestal, where a glimpse of the right foot covered with a typical shoe is visible. The head is covered with a cloak which falls over the body a bit rigidly, and over her left arm which holds the baby Jesus in an upright posture with his right arm placed in the typical position for blessing in the old Greek manner and his left arm holding what resembles a globe, like the virgin he is dressed in a clinging tunic. It has a unique form of shifting the hips to sustain the baby in its left arm, which is characteristic of the type of sculpture to which it belongs. In her right arm the Virgin carries a Pomegranate, placed there in a restoration done in 1937, after the damage suffered during the Spanish Civil War, and which replaced the Lilium she initially held. As an exterior adornment the image ports an aureola with an oval structure, something rare among images of the Virgin. The decoration itself is composed of a frame containing the enameled coat of arms of the primary countries of the Americas, and in the top-center is the coat of arms of Spain, the set is accentuated with alternating smooth and wavy beveled rays. It was created by Manuel Seco de Velasco and designed by Evaristo Dom√≠nguez, a painter from Palos de la Frontera. =Dating and style= Following the Byzantine art period of the late 13th century or early 14th century, the iconography of the model corresponds to the Hodegetria style (depicting Mary holding the Child Jesus as the source of salvation) developed in the Gothic period. The style is undoubtedly Gothic, specifically French- Gothic, different authors also point towards a possible inspiration from the school of Gothic Pyrenean-Aragonese-Navarro, and it could even belong to the Gothic Mannerism or to Gothic Normandy. Examples of this type of imagery and of similar style, can be found in the \\"Capilla de los Alabastros\\" in the Seville Cathedral or in Church of San Lorenzo of the same city. Also at Palos de la Frontera, in the Parish of San Jorge there is an Image of Santa Ana sculpted in the same material. The father √Ångel Ortega points out in his work that the ancient image of the Virgin of la Hiniesta de Gloria (lost in a 1932 fire) of the parish of San Juli√°n de Sevilla, could have been a contemporary or even have served as a model. The image as it appeared dressed before 1936. For centuries, the sculpture was polychrome, dressed in fine clothing, and adorned with precious stones according to all the various reports made on its restorations,Certificaci√≥n de Juan de Hinestrosa de la restauraci√≥n realizada en 1718 wills, documentation, and engravings stored at the monastery and at the archivesTestamento de Leonor Gonz√°lez, vecina de Palos, 28 de junio de 1488 of the French order in the Provincia Beltica. The custom of dressing the image was very deeply rooted during the Middle Ages and among the most famous were the Our Lady of Guadalupe found in C√°ceres, Spain, which received exquisite dresses at the hands of her adherents, a tradition still practiced and conserved in some of the local images of the area. Finally after the restoration done in 1937, it was decided to eliminate the polychrome from the image and in 1938 it was returned to worship at her monasteryDecreto de devoluci√≥n de la Imagen de Santa Mar√≠a de la R√°bida a la Orden Franciscana, expedido por el Cardenal Arzobispo de Sevilla, D.

(Archivo del convento de La R√°bida) in the original form in which it was sculpted. =La Rabida Monastery= La Rabida Monastery is the home of the image where it has been permanently kept practically since its creation and where it received its unique name, \\"Santa Mar√≠a de la R√°bida\\". It was erected in the 14th and 15th centuries. Among those buildings known for its artistic qualities are the Gothic-Mud√©jar church, the decorated stays containing frescoes by Daniel Vasquez Diaz, the cloister, and the museum housing numerous objects commemorating the Discovery of the Americas. Its irregular shape measures 2.00 m2 in area. The monastery, over its more than 500 years of history, has suffered several modifications, above all from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. La Rabida Monastery. It is one of the most prominent places from the events surrounding the discovery of the Americas; Columbus stayed there, it is the burial place of Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n, it was visited by various Spanish conquistadors, and many of their religious practiced in the evangelization of the Americas. That is why it forms part of the distinguished historic and artistic itinerary known as los Lugares Colombinos.Decreto 553/1967, de 2 de marzo, por el que se declara conjunto hist√≥rico art√≠stico el sector denominado ¬´Lugares Colombinos¬ª en la provincia de Huelva. BOE n¬∫ 69 de 22 March 1967. The monastery was declared a National Monument in 1885 and further more was declared \\"First Historic Monument of the Hispanic Pueblos\\" ().I Congreso Hispanoamericano de Historia. Madrid, Octubre de 1949. On February 28, 1992, it was given the Golden Medal of Andaluc√≠a () by the Andalusian Autonomous Government, and in the 9th Ibero-American Summit it was recognized as a meeting place for the Iberoamerican Community of Nations. History The image has suffered various vicissitudes throughout the centuries; however, there is no evidence to indicate any impersonation, theft, or total disappearance in the various fires that have affected the monastery, as indicated by P. Ortega in 1925: In the oldest documents it is denominated with the name \\"Santa Mar√≠a de la R√°bida\\".Bula pontificia \\"Etsi cunctorum\\", 6 de diciembre de 1412, de BENEDICTO XIII. Est√° considerada la carta fundacional del Monasterio de La R√°bida. This is the appellation that has become universal and the original native name. Additionally, due to the many ancient documents that record the favors and supposed miracles attributed to it, it is known as \\"Our Lady of Miracles\\". The original date on which it was carved, as well as the author and original monument upon which it was carried to the monastery remain unknown, the stylistic studies carried out have place it in the late 13th century or early 14th century. The Papal bull \\"Etsi cunctorum\\" of December 6, 1412, belonging to Antipope Benedict XIII already spoke of its appellation as a patron saint of the monastery, which places it before that date since the papal bull confirms the monastic life already existing in that particular hermitage. On another note, like many other images from the same area and time period, it is surrounded by various legends, fables, and traditions. However, all of them fundamentally lack historic or scientific backing. The majority are recognized in the 1714 codex of Fray Felipe de Santiago, where the traditions and legends of the area and time period are documented along with historical data. =Traditions and legends= Topographic Map of the la Villa de Huelva and the Lugares colombinos 1755. Among the most notable legends that circle the image are: *The supposed apostolic origin of the image. Refers to the relocation of the image from the Holy Land to Palos, and that it was a work of Luke the Evangelist. *The Virgin during the period of Arabian domination. Tells of how the image was deposited in the sea to avoid being desecrated by the Saracens until it was ready to be rescued at a better time. *The joyous find at Sea. Recounts the apparition of the Virgin among the nets of some fishermen from Huelva and its subsequent crowning in the Franciscan monastery. Both Fr. Angel Ortega and Fr. Sebastian Garcia among other authors repeat the tales, all of them largely inspired by the cited codex of 1714. =Apostolic origins= Circa the 18th century. The primitive lilium located in the right hand and the dress reflecting the time period can be observed. According to legend, the image would have been sculpted in the beginnings of Christianity by St. LukePiadosa leyenda que atribuye varias esculturas de la virgen al evangelista. La leyenda se basa en que es el evangelista que m√°s trata la infancia de Jes√∫s y m√°s datos aporta de la Virgen. and brought to the port of Palos in the year 333 by a Libyan sailor, Constantino Daniel. The sculpture was a gift from the bishop of Jerusalem Saint Macarius as a pious present for having dedicated the parish of Palos to the martyr, Saint George, a patron saint very widespread in the East. The codex recounts it: =Muslim period= The legends continue to attribute singular prodigious events and miracles to the image of the Virgin, including healing of sicknesses of all kinds, among the most noted was the cessation of a rabies epidemic when the sculpture had recently arrived. Also attributed is the defense of its homeland against pirate attacks. Under this halo of favors and healing, the image continued to be venerated until finally the peninsula fell under Muslim domination in 711. Under the imminent fear of having their patron saint desecrated or destroyed by the Saracens, two priests, Anselmo G√≥mez and Leandro Alberto, claimed that they had received a revelation commanding them to hide the image at sea until God saw a better moment to uncover it. Once the Muslims were established, they took the cenobite, and in the altar where the Virgin would have been located, they placed the \\"leg bone of Muhammad\\". However, according to the legend, the bone was cast repeatably onto the floor, it was never permitted to stay in the spot previously occupied by the Virgin, an act which the followers of the prophet would have attributed to a supposed Christian enchantment. The Muslims decided to have with them a Christian, since every time one was retained the phenomena would cease. Finally, unable to support such events, it was negotiated to return the cenobite to Christianity. =Reconquest: Apparition at sea= One of the last and most famous of the legends is regarding the apparition at sea, in the beach of \\"Morla\\", in the municipal territory of Palos, close to the monastery. According to this tradition, some fishermen from Huelva were casting their nets, and through fishing found the image which appeared in two pieces, first the Virgin with half of the Child, and later the rest of the Child. Upon finding her, the fishermen tried to take the image back to Huelva, which angered the townspeople of Palos. This led to disputes that were on the verge of ending in war between the two towns. Intervention was necessary by the overseeing abbot of the convent, whose opinion was respected by both sides, to finally resolve the issue; the Virgin was deposited in a boat near where she had appeared, leaving her alone without any crewmen, to see where the waves would take her. Eventually the boat arrived at the spot where the monastery was situated and they decided to dedicate an altar there to that image of that apparition.

Computational lithography has come to the forefront of photolithography in 2008 as the semiconductor industry grappled with the challenges associated with the transition to 22 nanometer CMOS process technology and beyond. 193 nm deep UV photolithography The periodic enhancement in the resolution achieved through photolithography has been a driving force behind Moore's Law. Resolution improvements enable printing of smaller geometries on an integrated circuit. The minimum feature size that a projection system typically used in photolithography can print is given approximately by: :CD = k_1 \\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{NA} where \\\\,CD is the minimum feature size (also called the critical dimension). \\\\,\\\\lambda is the wavelength of light used. \\\\,NA is the numerical aperture of the lens as seen from the wafer. \\\\,k_1 (commonly called k1 factor) is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors. Historically, resolution enhancements in photolithography have been achieved through the progression of stepper illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths -- from \\"g-line\\" (436 nm) and \\"i-line\\" (365 nm) sources based on mercury lamps, to the current systems based on deep ultraviolet excimer lasers sources at 193 nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with extreme ultraviolet lithography and x-ray lithography, forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193 nm optical lithography systems until some form of next-generation lithography proves viable (although 157 nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each). Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture have led to the use of immersion lithography. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much attention has been paid to reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as phase-shift photomasks. These techniques have enabled photolithography at the 32 nanometer CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193 nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the ITRS roadmap calling for the 22 nanometer node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22 nm technology manufacturable. While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: computational lithography. History  Computational lithography means the use of computers to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by Chris Mack at NSA in developing PROLITH, Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of Synopsys) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997. Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180 nm and 130 nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, phase shift masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65 nm to 45 nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45 nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in design for manufacturing start-up companies. A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of ASML) in 2005 to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions. As 45 nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32 nm and 22 nm are expected to run on existing 193 nm scanners technology. Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as source mask optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major mask synthesis vendors have settled on the term \\"computational lithography\\" to describe and promote the set of mask synthesis technologies required for 22 nm. Techniques comprising computational lithography Computational lithography makes use of a number of numerical simulations to improve the performance (resolution and contrast) of cutting-edge photomasks. The combined techniques include Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET), Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO), etc. The techniques vary in terms of their technical feasibility and engineering sensible-ness, resulting in the adoption of some and the continual R&D; of others. =Resolution enhancement technology = Resolution enhancement technologies, first used in the 90 nanometer generation, using the mathematics of diffraction optics to specify multi-layer phase-shift photomasks that use interference patterns in the photomask that enhance resolution on the printed wafer surface. =Optical proximity correction = Optical proximity correction uses computational methods to counteract the effects of diffraction-related blurring and under- exposure by modifying on-mask geometries with means such as: adjusting linewidths depending on the density of surrounding geometries (a trace surrounded by a large open area will be over-exposed compared with the same trace surrounded by a dense pattern), adding \\"dog-bone\\" endcaps to the end of lines to prevent line shortening, correcting for electron beam proximity effects OPC can be broadly divided into rule-based and model-based. Inverse lithography technology, which treats the OPC as an inverse imaging problem, is also a useful technique because it can provide unintuitive mask patterns. =Complex modeling of the lens system and photoresist= Beyond the models used for RET and OPC, computational lithographics attempts to improve chip manufacturability and yields such as by using the signature of the scanner to help improve accuracy of the OPC model: polarization characteristics of the lens pupil, Jones matrix of the stepper lens, optical parameters of the photoresist stack, diffusion through the photoresist, stepper illumination control variables. A CPU-century worth of calculations or more The computational effort behind these methods is immense. According to one estimate, the calculations required to adjust OPC geometries to take into account variations to focus and exposure for a state-of-the-art integrated circuit will take approximately 100 CPU-years of computer time. This does not include modeling the 3D polarization of the light source or any of the several other systems that need to be modeled in production computational photolithographic mask making flows. Brion Technologies, a subsidiary of ASML, the largest manufacturer of photolithography systems, markets a rack-mounted hardware accelerator dedicated for use in making computational lithographic calculations -- a mask-making shop can purchase a large number of their systems to run in parallel. Others have claimed significant acceleration using re-purposed off-the-shelf graphics cards for their high parallel throughput.

It allows safely running native code from a web browser, independent of the user operating system, allowing web apps to run at near-native speeds, which aligns with Google's plans for Chrome OS. It may also be used for securing browser plugins, and parts of other applications or full applications such as ZeroVM. To demonstrate the readiness of the technology, on 9 December 2011, Google announced the availability of several new Chrome-only versions of games known for their rich and processor-intensive graphics, including Bastion (no longer supported on the Chrome Web Store). NaCl runs hardware-accelerated 3D graphics (via OpenGL ES 2.0), sandboxed local file storage, dynamic loading, full screen mode, and mouse capture. There are also plans to make NaCl available on handheld devices. Portable Native Client (PNaCl) is an architecture-independent version. PNaCl apps are compiled ahead-of-time. PNaCl is recommended over NaCl for most use cases. The general concept of NaCl (running native code in web browser) has been implemented before in ActiveX, which, while still in use, has full access to the system (disk, memory, user- interface, registry, etc.). Native Client avoids this issue by using sandboxing. An alternative of sorts to NaCl is asm.js, which also allows applications written in C or C++ to be compiled to run in the browser (at more than half the native speed), and also supports ahead-of-time compilation, but is a subset of JavaScript and hence backwards-compatible with browsers that do not support it directly. Another alternative (while it may initially be powered by PNaCl) is WebAssembly. On October 12, 2016, a comment on the Chromium issue tracker indicated that Google's Pepper and Native Client teams had been destaffed. On May 30, 2017, Google announced deprecation of PNaCl in favor of WebAssembly. Although initially Google planned to remove PNaCl in first quarter of 2018, the removal is currently planned in the second quarter of 2019 (except for Chrome Apps). Overview Native Client is an open-source project being developed by Google. To date, Quake, XaoS, Battle for Wesnoth, Doom, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, From Dust, and MAME, as well as the sound processing system Csound, have been ported to Native Client. Native Client has been available in the Google Chrome web browser since version 14, and has been enabled by default since version 31, when the Portable Native Client (PNaCl, pronounced: pinnacle) was released. An ARM implementation was released in March 2010. x86-64, IA-32, and MIPS are also supported. To run an application portably under PNaCl, it must be compiled to an architecture- agnostic and stable subset of the LLVM intermediate representation bytecode. The executables are called PNaCl executables (pexes). The PNaCl Toolchain makes .pexe files; NaCl Toolchain .nexe files. The magic number of .nexe files is 0x7F 'E' 'L' 'F', which is ELF. In Chrome, they are translated to architecture-specific executables so that they can be run. NaCl uses software fault detection and isolation for sandboxing on x86-64 and ARM. The x86-32 implementation of Native Client is notable for its novel sandboxing method, which makes use of the x86 architecture's rarely used segmentation facility. Native Client sets up x86 segments to restrict the memory range that the sandboxed code can access. It uses a code verifier to prevent use of unsafe instructions such as those that perform system calls. To prevent the code from jumping to an unsafe instruction hidden in the middle of a safe instruction, Native Client requires that all indirect jumps be jumps to the start of 32-byte-aligned blocks, and instructions are not allowed to straddle these blocks. Because of these constraints, C and C++ code must be recompiled to run under Native Client, which provides customized versions of the GNU toolchain, specifically GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Binutils, and LLVM. Native Client is licensed under a BSD-style license. Native Client uses Newlib as its C library, but a port of GNU C Library (GNU libc) is also available. Pepper NaCl denotes sodium chloride, common table salt; as a pun, the name of pepper was also used. Pepper API is a cross-platform, open-source API for creating Native Client modules. Pepper Plugin API, or PPAPI is a cross- platform API for Native Client-secured web browser plugins, first based on Netscape's NPAPI, then rewritten from scratch. It is currently used in Chromium and Google Chrome to enable the PPAPI version of Adobe Flash and the built-in PDF viewer. =PPAPI= On 12 August 2009, a page on Google Code introduced a new project, Pepper, and the associated Pepper Plugin API (PPAPI), \\"a set of modifications to NPAPI to make plugins more portable and more secure\\". This extension is designed specifically to ease implementing out-of-process plugin execution. Further, the goals of the project are to provide a framework for making plugins fully cross-platform. Topics considered include: *Uniform semantics for NPAPI across browsers. *Execution in a separate process from the renderer-browser. *Standardize rendering using the browser's compositing process. *Defining standardized events, and 2D rasterizing functions. *Initial attempt to provide 3D graphics access. *Plugin registry. The Pepper API also supports Gamepads (version 19) and WebSockets (version 18). , Google's open source browser, Chromium, was the only web browser to use the new browser plug-in model. As of 2020, Pepper is supported by Chrome, Chromium and Blink layout engine-based browsers such as Opera and Microsoft Edge. In January 2020, Google announced that support for PPAPI would be removed from Google Chrome and Chromium in June 2021.  PPAPI in Firefox  Mozilla Firefox stated in 2014 that they would not support Pepper, as there is no full specification of the API beyond its implementation in Chrome, which itself is designed for use with Blink layout engine only, and has private APIs specific to the Flash Player plugin which are not documented. In October 2016 Mozilla announced that it had re-considered and was exploring whether to incorporate the Pepper API and PDFium in future releases of Firefox, however no such steps were taken. Applications One website uses NaCL on the server to let users experiment with the Go programming language from their browsers. Reception Some groups of browser developers support the Native Client technology, but others do not. =Supporters= Chad Austin (of IMVU) praised the way Native Client can bring high-performance applications to the web (with about 5% penalty compared to native code) in a secure way, while also accelerating the evolution of client-side applications by giving a choice of the programming language used (besides JavaScript). Id Software's John D. Carmack praised Native Client at QuakeCon 2012, saying: \\"if you have to do something inside a browser, Native Client is much more interesting as something that started out as a really pretty darn clever x86 hack in the way that they could sandbox all of this in user mode interestingly. It's now dynamic recompilation, but something that you program in C or C++ and it compiles down to something that's going to be not your -O4 optimization level for completely native code but pretty damn close to native code. You could do all of your evil pointer chasings, and whatever you want to do as a to-the-metal game developer.\\" =Detractors= Other IT professionals are more critical of this sandboxing technology as it has substantial or substantive interoperability issues. Mozilla's vice president of products, Jay Sullivan, said that Mozilla has no plans to run native code inside the browser, as \\"These native apps are just little black boxes in a webpage. [...] We really believe in HTML, and this is where we want to focus.\\" Mozilla's Christopher Blizzard criticized NaCl, claiming that native code cannot evolve in the same way that the source code-driven web can. He also compared NaCl to Microsoft's ActiveX technology, plagued with DLL Hell. H√•kon Wium Lie, Opera's CTO, believes that \\"NaCl seems to be 'yearning for the bad old days, before the web'\\", and that \\"Native Client is about building a new platform ‚Äì or porting an old platform into the web [...] it will bring in complexity and security issues, and it will take away focus from the web platform.\\" Second generation The second generation of sandboxing developed in Google is gVisor.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17810591https://github.com/google/gvisor It is intended to replace NaCl in Google Cloud, to be more exact in Google App Engine.

In 1905, Gore was the head of the mathematics department and taught a majority of the undergraduate and graduate courses. He is the author of nearly 20 books covering topics including mathematics, geodesy, European politics, travel and art. Much of his writing was influenced by his time spent in Berlin, Leyden, and Brussels, where he completed his post-graduate studies. Gore was also a member of several European royal societies such as Commandeur of the Order of Leopold (Belgium), a member of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) and a member of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Each of these societies are related to the royal parties of Belgium and the Netherlands and are generally bestowed upon individuals who have demonstrated dedication and commitment towards these respective areas. History James Howard Gore was born to Mahlon Gore and Sydney Cather in Frederick County, Virginia. Growing up, he lived on a farm with his family. At the age of four, his father died. From this point on, his mother took on the responsibility of raising Gore and his two brothers, with whom he shared farm chores. From an early age, Gore displayed interest in the sciences and mathematics and often read scientific literature. Gore took his education very seriously and chose to attend the Hamilton Academy, Richmond College, and finally Columbian University (now George Washington University). Gore also took time abroad and performed his post graduate studies in Berlin, Leyden and Brussels from 1894 through 1897. However, it was in 1877 that Gore graduated from Columbian University but remained there as a tutor. Thus began his profession of teaching. During 1878‚Äì1881 he served as a tutor at Columbian University in mathematics; during 1881‚Äì1883 Gore served as an adjunct professor of mathematics at Columbian University; in 1884‚Äì1887 he was professor of mathematics and geodesy at the Corcoran Scientific School at the George Washington University; during 1884‚Äì1909 Gore was a respected professor at the Corcoran Scientific school until his retirement; in 1888 he received an honorary doctorate from Columbian University; and during 1909‚Äì1939 Gore was a professor emeritus until his death in 1939. Throughout his time teaching at George Washington University, Gore lived not too far away in a neighborhood frequented by today's students in Friendship Heights, Maryland. On July 20, 1889, Gore married Lillian van Sparrendahl and they had one child. He died on June 10, 1939, at the age of 82. George Washington University continues to preserve materials from his days as a professor. Publications Outside of his teaching career, Gore wrote several publications, including Geodesy; Elements of Geodesy; History of Geodesy; Physical Geography; Parliamentary Law; German Science Reader; Editor of German Texts; Political Parties and Party Policies in Germany; Dutch Art as Seen by a Layman; How to See Holland; Holland as Seen by an American; Legionnaires: A Directory of the Citizens of the United States of whom France has conferred her National Order, the Legion of Honor.

The Policewoman of the Royal Malaysia Police was first established during the Malayan emergency period, when local women were recruited as Special Police. In August 1955, the Policewoman Unit was officially organised. History The involvement of women in policing institutions began on 23 June 1948. This restored the women involved in the movement of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) during the emergency in 1948. The early history of the establishment of women police from the emergency period in 1948 and the first intake of seven women's with the rank of Women Police Inspector in 1955. The first intake of 56 Women Police Constables (WPC) were ranked was in 1956. An Englishwoman police officer, Miss BDB Wentworth, was assigned to the Policewoman Unit to aid in efforts to recruit the Malayan pioneer group of policewomen. Intake the Women Special Constable or Special Constabulary (SC) have a very good response, especially among those who live in rural areas. Members of the SC women assigned to the gates of entry and exit of new villages. They carried out their duties with the policemen and the male SC. They tasks perform is as Inspecting Officer or Women Searcher against women and children. Prior to the establishment of SC women, these tasks formerly carried out by the police wives and civilians who are appointed as examiners for women. After serving 52 years, the women police officers had proven their ability and excellence in various fields. The government at that time actively launched the operation to prevent food supplies from falling into the hands of communist terrorists. After the declaration of emergency was made, the government found that the most effective means to oppose communist terrorism was by checking those people receiving food supplies from public sources. This project required inspection/examination in villages, and because most of the people who worked as rubber tappers in Malaysia were women, they were ideal for the duties of checking food supply receivers. Special Policewomen also worked in jails and as police escorts for women and children who were detained. Since then, the Policewoman Unit continues to develop, and further plays a vital role to maintain the peace and peoples' well-being in Malaysia.

History The illustrator and designer Walter Crane served as the founding president of the Society for its first three years. Of its goals and purposes, he wrote: Annual exhibitions were held at the New Gallery in 1888, 1889, and 1890, but the third exhibition failed to match the quality of the first two, and was a financial disaster.Parry 2005, p. 70 William Morris succeeded Crane as president in 1891., and the Society thereafter chose to reduce the frequency of showings in order to ensure an abundance of materials to display. The Society published Arts and Crafts Essays, an influential collection of essays on the decorative arts by its members, in 1893. Contributors included Morris, Crane, T. J. Cobden-Sanderson, Ford Madox Brown, and May Morris. The fourth exhibition, held in 1893, was far more successful, and the fifth exhibition of 1896‚Äîalthough clouded by the death of William Morris on its planned opening day‚Äîproved to be its most influential.Parry 2005, p. 71 The 1899 exhibit featured a Morris retrospective.Parry 2005, p. 79 Another successful exhibition was held in 1903, but the Society suffered organizational problems in the new century, with the exhibitions of 1906, 1910, 1912 and 1916 each being held in a different location. Crane died in 1915, and architect and designer Henry Wilson was president from 1915 to 1922, but the exhibitions failed to recover the critical and artistic success of the 1890s.Parry 2005, pp. 89-92 In 1915, W. R. Lethaby and other members, recognising the limitations of the Society's devotion to craft methods of production, set up the Design and Industries Association to improve the standards of British industrial design. In the 1930s it became clear to some members that if the Society was to survive in any form it had to confront the role of the crafts in relation to industry and the place of machinery in craft production. The Society‚Äôs 1935 exhibition introduced a section devoted to mass-produced articles designed by craftsmen to demonstrate the influence the crafts could have on industry, which brought its exhibitions to the notice of the press again.\\"Arts and Crafts at Burlington House\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 November 1938, p.5 This move was controversial within the Society and led to some resignations. The Society continued to exhibit periodically until the 1950s and many eminent craftsmen and women were associated with it.John Farleigh, The Creative Craftsman, London: G.Bell and Sons, 1950 In 1960, it merged with the Cambridgeshire Guild of Craftsmen to form the Society of Designer Craftsmen, which is still active.

He is the Mayor of Chattanooga. He is a member of the Democratic Party and represented Hamilton and Marion counties in the 10th district as state senator from 2007 to 2012. On March 5, 2013, he became Chattanooga's Mayor Elect, and was inaugurated on April 15, 2013.http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/mar/06/andy-berke-is-new- chattanooga-mayor/?local Early life and education Berke was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marvin and Karen Berke. He has one sister, Julie. He attended Rivermont Elementary, Baylor School in Chattanooga, where he was a standout tennis player, and Stanford University, where he met his wife, Monique. He currently lives in Chattanooga with his wife and their two daughters, Hannah and Orly. After graduating from Stanford with honors, Berke worked as a legislative assistant for U.S. Congressman Bart Gordon. Following his graduation from the University of Chicago Law School, he worked as a law clerk for Judge Deanell Reece Tacha of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Lawrence, Kansas. During this time he also taught at the University of Kansas School of Law as an adjunct professor. Berke returned home to Chattanooga and was admitted to the Tennessee Bar in 1994. He joined his family law practice, Berke, Berke, and Berke in Chattanooga, which was founded in 1934 by his grandfather, the late Harry Berke. Public office =State Senate= Berke entered a 2007 special election to replace longtime state senator Ward Crutchfield and defeated Republican Oscar Brock, son of former U.S. Senator Bill Brock, with 63% to Brock's 37%. He was sworn into the Tennessee Senate on November 21, 2007. During the 105th General Assembly, Berke served as the secretary of the Senate Education Committee and as a member of the Senate Transportation Committee. Berke won re-election on November 4, 2008, by defeating Republican Oscar Brown. He received over 70% of the vote.

On November 24, 2008, Senator Berke was elected as the Secretary/Treasurer of the Senate Democratic Caucus. =Chattanooga mayoral campaign= On May 8, 2012 Berke officially announced he was running for Mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Berke became Chattanooga's Mayor Elect on March 5, 2013, after receiving 72% of the vote. He was inaugurated as Chattanooga Mayor on April 15, 2013. =First mayoral term = Within the first month of taking office, Berke reorganized city government, merging the Departments of Parks and Recreation and Human Services into a new Department of Youth and Family Development, the Departments of Neighborhood Services and Community Development into a new Department of Economic and Community Development, eliminating the Department of Education, Arts, and Culture, and creating a new Department of Transportation to handle Transportation matters once handled by the Department of Public Works. Within his first year as mayor, Berke formed a task force to reform the City of Chattanooga Police and Fire Pension and overhauled the Pension Plan, saving taxpayers over $227 million while preserving benefits for first responders. During Berke's first term, Chattanooga's unemployment rate fell from a June 2011 high of 9.5% to 4.1% in May 2016, a nine-year low, and the city of Chattanooga created over 8,000 new jobs. On July 14, 2014, Berke joined other local and state officials to announce the Volkswagen Crossblue would be manufactured in Chattanooga, resulting in over 2,000 new jobs for residents. In addition to a boom of manufacturing jobs, Chattanooga's 10 Gigabit fiber optic infrastructure helped fuel wage growth, resulting in the third fastest wage growth in the country for a medium-sized metro area. On January 14, 2015, Berke established an Innovation District, making Chattanooga the first mid-sized city with an innovation district. Since that time, Chattanooga's Innovation District has been a catalyst for change in the city's downtown, resulting in $700 million in new retail, office and residential space, and 868 new business licenses issued in 2016 alone. Under Berke, Chattanooga has received national recognition for its work in digital equity. A new program called Tech Goes Home, modeled after an award-winning program in Boston, ensures equal access to technology by offering technology training, skills, and access to families. In his 2015 State of the City Address, Berke also announced a new partnership with Chattanooga's Electric Power Board (EPB) to offer discounted high-speed internet access to students on free and reduced lunch through a program called NetBridge. Six months after the launch of the Innovation District, four Marines and a sailor were killed during a terror-inspired attack in Chattanooga. In the hours to follow, Berke called the incident a \\"nightmare for the city of Chattanooga\\" and pledged all available resources to aid the FBI in its investigation. Because of his leadership during and following the attack, Berke was invited to lead the U.S. delegation at the first annual Strong Cities Network Global Summit held in Antalya, Turkey, on May 11, 2016. The creation of an Innovation District and his response to the July 16 attack were both cited as factors in Berke's recognition as American City & County's 2015 Municipal Leader of the Year. On December 15, 2015, Berke was recognized by OZY.com as a Rising Star, citing Chattanooga's technology boom as the major factor in the city's turnaround. In 2016, Berke announced new efforts to combat violence including investments in public safety technology and a new Citizen Safety Coalition, a new Office of Early learning and a partnership with United Way to offer early learning scholarships, and a Family Friendly Workplace challenge to get more businesses to adopt policies making their business more friendly for working parents. Berke announced new investments in neighborhoods in 2016 including $6 million for a new Youth and Family Development center in Avondale, $887,000 for a new park at the former Charles A Bell School site in Alton Park, $1.5 million for the cleanup of the old Dixie Yarn Mill in Lupton City, completed $2 million in upgrades of the Wilcox Tunnel in East Chattanooga, and the construction of a new Miller Park District as the gateway to the MLK Neighborhood. =Mayoral re-election campaign = On September 6, 2016, Mayor Berke announced his bid for re-election to a second term as Chattanooga Mayor. Berke's campaign announcement focused on combating gun violence, enhancing workforce development, and expanding the city's focus on early childhood education. Berke won re-election against District 4 City Councilman Larry Grohn, a member of the Chattanooga Tea Party, former District 3 City Councilman and City Sustainability Director under the Littlefield Administration, David Crockett, and housing developer, Chris Long.

The primary audience includes programmers, developers, system architects, and system designers.  Overview  An API is a library consisting of interfaces, functions, classes, structures, enumerations, etc. for building a software application. It is used by developers to interact with and extend the software. An API for a given programming language or system may consist of system-defined and user-defined constructs. As the number and complexity of these constructs increases, it becomes very tedious for developers to remember all of the functions and the parameters defined. Hence, the API writers play a key role in building software applications. Due to the technical subject matter, API writers must understand application source code enough to extract the information that API documents require. API writers often use tooling that extracts software documentation placed by programmers in the source code in a structured manner, preserving the relationships between the comments and the programming constructs they document. API writers must also understand the software product and document the new features or changes as part of the new software release. The schedule of software releases varies from organization to organization. API writers need to understand the software life cycle well and integrate themselves into the systems development life cycle (SDLC). API writers in the United States generally follow The Chicago Manual of Style for grammar and punctuation.  Qualifications  API writers typically possess a mix of programming and language skills; many API writers have backgrounds in programming or technical writing. *Computer programming background (Knowledge of C, C++, Java, PHP, or other programming languages) *Knowledge of formatting standards like Doxygen, Javadoc, OpenAPI, or DITA *Knowledge of editors and tools, like FrameMaker *Excellent communication and writing skills to interact with developers Expert API/software development kit (SDK) writers can easily become programming writers.  API writing process  The API writing process is typically split between analyzing and understanding the source code, planning, writing, and reviewing. It is often the case that the analytical, planning, and writing stages do not occur in a strictly linear fashion. The writing and evaluation criteria vary between organizations. Some of the most effective API documents are written by those who are adequately capable of understanding the workings of a particular application, so that they can relate the software to the users or the various component constructs to the overall purpose of the program. API writers may also be responsible for authoring end-user product documentation. While reference documentation may be auto-generated to ensure completeness, documentation that helps developers get started should be written by a professional API writer and reviewed by subject matter experts. This helps ensure that developers understand key concepts and can get started quickly.

In Japan, it was introduced in 1983 and promoted as \\"\\" because it had three roles in one machine: a PC, a word processing machine which was traditionally marketed as a machine different from a PC in Japan, and an IBM-host attached terminal. General The IBM PC that had been marketed by IBM since 1981, using Intel 8088, was not powerful enough to process the far eastern languages of Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Nor was the resolution of IBM PC's display high enough to show the complex characters of these languages. The IBM 5550 was first introduced in Japan in March 1983, using Intel 8086 microprocessor and was called \\"Multistation 5550\\" because it had three roles in one machine: a PC, a word processing machine which was traditionally marketed in Japan as a machine different from a PC, and an online terminal. After the Japanese 5550 models, Korean, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese models were also introduced. IBM 5550 initially used its own architecture, but, later since 1987, was changed to use IBM Personal System/2's Micro Channel Architecture, being renamed as Personal System/55. In Japan, Kiyoshi Atsumi, a film actor, was used to promote the 5550. IBM later introduced IBM JX for home users in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and DOS/V for both business and home users in Japan.  Features  PS/55 The 5550 was originally planned as a terminal with a combination of word processing and personal computing targeted for Japanese computer market. To display 24 dots Mincho kanji typeface which was also used in many Japanese electrical word processors, the 5550 had high display resolution such as a 1024√ó768 pixel graphic screen. The 5550 read a display font from an external storage to support multilingual include Japanese, Chinese, and Korean language. The 5550 provided below three roles: * Japanese Business Personal Computer: developed by Microsoft. * Japanese word processor: developed by IBM. * Japanese online terminal: and developed by IBM. The original Bunsho Program and emulators booted from a floppy disk without Nihongo DOS. They used a proprietary disk format which couldn't be read from Nihongo DOS, so users had to replace floppy disks or set the boot partition to switch between two programs. Also, they had to use a conversion program to exchange data. Later, they were ported for Nihongo DOS, and functions were gradually implemented. The 3270 Kanji Emulation was superseded by the Nihongo 3270 PC released in October 1983, and the 5250 Kanji Emulation was superseded by the Nihongo 5250 PC in September 1984. The Bunsho Program was also superseded by the DOS Bunsho Program in May 1986. The first generation of IBM 5550 had up to three 5¬º inch double-density (720 KB) floppy drives because the Bunsho Program used three floppy disks; program disk, font disk, and user's data disk. Later, two-drive models contained a font ROM card as other Japanese personal computers did.  Development  of IBM Fujisawa Development Laboratory planned the terminal with a combination of word processor and personal computer, called the Multi- functional Workstation, and he proposed it at the headquarter in March 1981. The development team was founded as an Independent Business Unit (IBU). IBM Displaywriter System The team set goals for IBM 5550 that the machine was usable for both word processing and personal computing on the same architecture at least 3-5 years. They tried to build the 5550 from the IBM Displaywriter System 6580, the English word processor developed in Austin office in 1980, and the IBM Personal Computer developed in Boca Raton office, but it was difficult to combine different types of machines. Considering price‚Äìperformance ratio and continuity of an architecture, the team examined processors chosen from Intel's and other manufacturers. The IBM PC used an Intel 8088, but the 5550 employed an Intel 8086 because bus speed largely influenced for performance of the machine which had high display resolution. To gain an advantage over competitors in Japanese word processing, 24 pixel font models render characters in a box of 26√ó29 pixels, and the total display resolution is 1066√ó725 pixels calculated with box width by 41√ó25 text. 16 pixel font models render characters in a box of 18√ó21 pixels, and the total display resolution is 738√ó525 pixels. The 5550 had one more column than 40 columns of usual Japanese computers, which enabled line breaking. Multiplan on PS/55 For personal computing, the Nihongo DOS K2.00 had been developed by Microsoft. It was a Japanese localization of MS-DOS 2.0 followed to Toshiba's PASOPIA 16. The Nihongo DOS bundled the Microsoft BASIC interpreter specialized for IBM 5550. Programming languages and the Japanese version of Multiplan were also provided. The team didn't consider the machine was used for online communication, but they realized its importance during the development. They decided to add a role of a terminal in January 1982. This change extended the development term. In May 1982 Business Show (one of computer industry exhibitions in Japan), IBM Japan only displayed the IBM PC as a reference material. They unveiled the development of 5550 in fall 1982. IBM Japan didn't have a factory for mass production of personal computers, so the production of 5550 was outsourced to some companies. System units, hard disks, and monitors were manufactured by Matsushita Electric Industrial, printers by Oki Electric Industry, and keyboards by Alps Electric.  Models  * 5551-A/B/C/D/E/G/H/J/K/M/P (Basic models, placed beside the display. Later became a smaller size like 5540) * 5541-B/E/J/K/M/P (Smaller size models, on which the display can be placed. Later made even smaller) * 5561-G/H/J/K/M/P (Larger size models, all models employ Intel 80286) * 5530-G/H (Stand-alone models, without the communications adapter. Used 3¬Ω inch floppy disk) * 5535-M (Laptop, using 3¬Ω inch floppy disk) Competition In Japan, Multistation 5550 competed against: * Fujitsu FACOM 9450 and FMR Series * NEC PC-9801 Series and NEC N5200/5300 Series Reception BYTE in 1983 speculated that \\"we may soon see a similar machine here in America\\". Describing the 5550 as \\"a true workstation\\", the magazine envisioned the computer as filling the \\"considerable gulf above the PC\\", and a rival to the IBM System/36 minicomputer. It praised the 5550's \\"unprecedented\\" combination of kanji support with high-end word-processing capability, and reported that in Japan an ecosystem of vendors providing products for the computer was forming. The magazine concluded that \\"if the American PC is any precedent, the market should soon be filled with 5550 software\\".

These particles are heavier than warm dark matter and hot dark matter, but are lighter than the traditional forms of cold dark matter, such as Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). The Lee-Weinberg bound limits the mass of the favored dark matter candidate, WIMPs, that interact via the weak interaction to \\\\approx 2 GeV. This bound arises as follows. The lower the mass of WIMPs is, the lower the annihilation cross section, which is of the order \\\\approx m^2/M^4, where m is the WIMP mass and M the mass of the Z-boson. This means that low mass WIMPs, which would be abundantly produced in the early universe, freeze out (i.e. stop interacting) much earlier and thus at a higher temperature, than higher mass WIMPs. This leads to a higher relic WIMP density. If the mass is lower than \\\\sim 2 GeV the WIMP relic density would overclose the universe. Some of the few loopholes allowing one to avoid the Lee-Weinberg bound without introducing new forces below the electroweak scale have been ruled out by accelerator experiments (i.e. CERN, Tevatron), and in decays of B mesons. A viable way of building light dark matter models is thus by postulating new light bosons. This increases the annihilation cross section and reduces the coupling of dark matter particles to the Standard Model making them consistent with accelerator experiments.  Motivation  In recent years, light dark matter has become popular due in part to the many benefits of the theory. Sub-GeV dark matter has been used to explain the positron excess in the galactic center observed by INTEGRAL, excess gamma rays from the galactic center and extragalactic sources. It has also been suggested that light dark matter may explain a small discrepancy in the measured value of the fine structure constant in different experiments.

Flat interest rate mortgages and loans calculate interest based on the amount of money a borrower receives at the beginning of a loan. However, if repayment is scheduled to occur at regular intervals throughout the term, the average amount to which the borrower has access is lower and so the effective or true rate of interest is higher. Only if the principal is available in full throughout the loan term does the flat rate equate to the true rate. This is the case in the example to the right, where the loan contract is for 400,000 Cambodian riels over 4 months. Interest is set at 16,000 riels (4%) a month while principal is due in a single payment at the end. Flat rate calculations Flat interest example APR Loans with interest quoted using a flat rate originated before currency was invented and continued to feature regularly up to and beyond the 20th century within developed countries. More recently, they have also come to be used in the informal economy of developing countries, frequently adopted by microcredit institutions. One reason for the popularity of flat rates is their ease of use. For example, a loan of $1,200 can be structured with 12 monthly repayments of $100, plus interest, due on the same dates, of 1% ($12) a month, resulting in a total monthly payment of $112. However, the borrower only has access to $1,200 at the very beginning of the loan. Since $100 in principal is being paid each month, the average amount to which the borrower has access during the loan term is approximately half, in fact just over $600. For this reason, as mentioned above, the true rate of interest is nearly double. \\"A general rule known by financial managers is that when flat interest is used, the APR is almost twice as much as the quoted interest rate.\\"Chuck Waterfield. 'The role of interest rates in microfinance'. In Microfinance India: State of the Sector Report 2008 (N. Srinivasan, Sage Publications, Los Angeles, New Delhi, 2009), p. 63.For detailed comparison of amortization charts, see Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest, 'Microcredit interest rates' Occasional Paper #1, August 1996, pp. 4-8 In order to show the true rate underlying a flat rate, it is necessary to use the declining balance amortization schedule, dividing the total cost to the borrower by the average amount outstanding. In the first three examples on the right the borrower is quoted 1% a month. These are loans of $1,200 each, amortized with level payments over 4, 12 and 24 months. In the 4-month example, the borrower will make four equal payments of $300 in principal and 4 equal payments of $12 (1% of $1,200) in interest. The total cost of this loan is the principal plus $48.00 in interest, whilst the average amount outstanding was approximately $600. This yields an annualized flat rate of 12%, and an annualized effective or true rate of 19.05%. The true rate can also be calculated by iteration from the amortization schedule, using the compound interest formula. To keep quoted interest rates as low as possible, institutions also often call for one-time origination or administration fees. However, an origination fee as low as 4% of the total loan can have a large impact on the borrower's total costs. This is especially true for short-term loans, a typical characteristic of microcredit. As these fees represent an inherent cost of borrowing, they must also be added to the charge for interest in order to show the effective APR. Benefits of flat rate lending Flat interest rates have the following advantages: * They are easy to calculate and track: Flat interest rates require no calculations to blend principal and interest into a level payment and, as long as these are made on time, require no compounding calculations (see the example to the right). Flat rates keep loan commitments clear, transparent and easily tracked by both parties. Many microfinance institutions do not have computers, so the complexity of true, declining balance calculations may confuse their borrowers and even their staff. Semi-formal institutions like self-help groups, village banks and ASCAs also usually prefer the flat rate method. * They meet vital cash flow needs of farmers: Many borrowers in developing countries are farmers who demand loans with balloon payments, repayable after they harvest their crops. When the borrower has use of the full amount of principal throughout the entire loan term, flat rate calculations equate to true rate. For farmers accustomed to these types of transactions, flat rate cash loans are familiar and easy to understand. * They support 'in-kind' loan transactions: As mentioned above, flat rate loans originated before currency was invented, and are commonly used to repay loans in regular instalments of chickens, eggs, kilos of rice, and so on. Problems with flat rate lending Flat interest rates have the following disadvantages: * They are complicated by early or late payments: If a loan calls for repayment at regular intervals but these are not made when due, the total cost of credit and those repayments are inapplicable; interest must be recalculated based on (a) the amount outstanding from time to time and (b) the true rate. If the loan is repaid ahead of time, refusing to allow an interest discount would be unfair to borrowers and remove the incentive to honour their legal obligations early. Conversely, if the loan is repaid late, failing to apply additional interest would be unfair to lenders and encourage borrowers to dishonor their legal obligations. In either case, it is a mistake to claim that that \\"flat\\" means \\"fixed\\" in the sense of the original total cost of credit. Writing of the practices of microfinance institutions in Bangladesh, S.M. Rahman points out that \\"[i]f one client takes a loan today and offers to repay the entire loan the next day, the client has to repay the total loan along with the whole year's interest, reckoned on a flat rate system.\\"S.M. Rahman. A practitioner's view of the challenges facing NGO-based microfinance in Bangladesh. In Thomas Dichter and Malcolm Harper (eds.) What's Wrong with Microfinance? Intermediate Technology Publications Ltd., Warwickshire, UK, 2007, p. 198. * Their meaning is sometimes confused: The expression \\"flat rate\\" is sometimes mistaken for \\"fixed rate\\". As mentioned above, flat rate is a method of calculating the total cost of credit if all payments are made on time. Whether or not a rate is variable depends on the terms of the underlying agreement. * They can make it difficult to compare rates: As with weights and measures, a common system is not the only but represents the simplest way of comparing offers. Loans quoted with flat interest rates generally prevail where declining balance calculations are not understandable to most borrowers, which - as mentioned above - is the case almost everywhere. \\"Not only the clients but even educated people sometimes have trouble understanding this system. The problem is that the flat rate gives an impression of a lower rate than it actually is.\\"S.M. Rahman in Dichter & Harper, p. 198. Where loans quoted with declining balance rates are not required by law, flat interest rates are also often used. The latter will be selected by borrowers if they mistakenly believe all rates are comparable without adjustment. Chuck Waterfield, designer of Microfin, a widely used financial modeling tool for MFIs, asks \\"Why did such a system appear in microfinance lending? The answer is obvious and cannot be debated: it allows the institution to charge nearly twice as much interest for the quoted interest rate as with the declining balance method.\\"Waterfield in Srinivasan, p. 63. * They may result in undervaluation of a loan portfolio: In addition, flat rate calculations may slightly understate the size of an outstanding loan portfolio which could result in the appearance of a lower average loan size and of a higher yield. Both of these characteristics appeal to donors and external financiers.'Microcredit interest rates', p. 9 Towards consumer protection in borrowing The less developed an economy, the less capacity the government may have to regulate informal lenders. As a result, Brigit Helms argues for an evolutionary approach to interest rates, in which they can be expected to gradually drop as competition increases and the government gains greater capacity to effectively enforce comparable interest rate disclosures on financial sector actors.Brigit Helms & Xavier Reilly. Microfinance interest rates: the story so far. Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, Sept, 2004, p. 15 F.W. Raiffeisen as early as 1889, writing to the credit unions then emerging in Germany, campaigned against maintaining the total charge for credit unchanged, even when a loan is repaid early. ‚ÄúIt is immoral to charge interest in advance, and also objectionable as a business method. Every member shall have the right at any time to pay back his loan. If interest has been charged for a full year in advance, the members who have made repayments ahead of time, pay too much interest, unless the Credit Union makes a refund.‚ÄùF.W. Raiffeisen, The Credit Unions. Eighth edition, December 1966, The Raiffeisen Printing and Publishing Co., Neuwied on the Rhine, Germany. Translated to English by Konrad Engelmann. p. 74. Separately, interest rate ceilings and popular conflation of flat with true rates, has led some institutions to replace or complement interest with transaction fees and other charges, sometimes circumventing disclosure norms consistent with APR. For these reasons, interest is no longer quoted by reference to the flat rate in certain developed countries (for example, in the US, see the Truth in Lending Act), whilst many insist that loans always quote the APR. Nevertheless, loans originally quoted and engaged with a flat rate remain contractually valid and still feature widely in both developed and developing countries.

Retrofitted ramps (these also intended for push chairs/prams. V-shaped bicycle stairway beside a short staircase Concrete push ramp in Stockholm Bicycle stairway within a vehicle ferry A bicycle stairway is a pedestrian stairway which also has a channel alongside it to facilitate walking a bicycle up or down the stairway. The channel itself is also often called a wheeling ramp, push ramp or runnel. There is no standard in the dimensions, materials, or shape used in the channel, however the channel is intended to be sufficient to guide a variety of bicycle tires without binding or causing damage. Cross-section shapes vary, but are usually either nearly rectangular or V- or U-shaped. Depth is generally 2 to 6 cm (1 to 2.5 inches) and width 6 to 13 cm (2.5 to 5 inches). If the stairs do not turn and are relatively short, a flat cross section without sidewalls may suffice. The channel is an inclined plane within easy reach of someone using the stairs. There may be level portions for resting or passing. While most examples of existing bicycle stairs feature permanent or built-in channels, Oregon Health & Science University has invested in the development of a modular, after-market, retrofitting \\"bicycle gutter\\" device that was awarded patents in 2011 and 2012. Accessibility requirements for handrails tend to conflict with bicycle stairways, as handrails may obstruct or decrease the control of a bicyclist using the channel. Suggestions for resolving the conflicts include providing a single handrail down the middle of the stairs with gutters at the outside edges, or placing handrails at both edges and placing the gutter in the middle. However, the Toronto Transit Commission is testing channels placed next to handrails. Some users have commented about the disadvantages, such as pedals catching on the stairs' handrail. Bicycle stairways may have arisen in reaction to wear and compaction beside outdoor stairways where people preferred to roll their bicycle on smooth lawn or soil instead of carrying it or having it bump along the stairs.

The E77 used feathers as a vector to disseminate anti-crop agents from a hydrogen-filled balloon and was first developed in 1950. Background In the late stages of World War II, Japan employed thousands of incendiary and antipersonnel weapons via unmanned balloon, using some 9,300 of these devices, releasing them into the high altitude jet stream to travel over the Pacific Ocean to the North American mainland. The Japanese use of these balloon munitions inspired the E77, though no direct connection was made between the two.Whitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 157‚Äì67, (). History Development of the E77 balloon bomb began in 1950. The design of the E77 was based on the design for the World War II Japanese bomb and approved by the Army's Chemical Corps Technical Committee in April 1951. At time of its development the E77 represented one-sixth of all U.S. biological munitions efforts. The E77 was designated a \\"strategic weapon\\" and readied for deployment but was never used in warfare as subsequent developments in munitions supplanted the E77, especially the 750-pound E86 cluster bomb.Wheelis, Mark, et al. Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 218, (). Specifications Similar to the Japanese fire balloon on which its design is based, the E77 utilized a hydrogen-filled balloon. Suspended from the balloon envelope was a 32 inch by 24 inch balloon gondola. The E77 was an anti-crop munition, designed to disseminate anti-crop agents, such as wheat stem rust. The balloon bomb employed a dissemination method similar to that of the M115 anti-crop bomb, or \\"feather bomb\\". This dissemination method combined a culture of anti- crop agent with a light-weight vector, in this case, feathers.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 2 - History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: p. 51), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed December 9, 2008. Tests involving the E77 At least three separate sets of tests were conducted with the E77 balloon bomb. From October to December 1954 41 E77s were launched at Vernalis, California, which demonstrated that the munition met \\"military characteristics\\" to create high levels of plant infection on targeted crops. Further testing in 1958 showed that when cereal rust spores were delivered via an oil-based vector (wet spores) that they remained viable for longer periods in less than ideal environmental conditions. Subsequent investigations at Fort Detrick and the University of Minnesota came to several positive conclusions about the effectiveness of oils as carriers of the rust spores.

Asteroid 831 Stateira is named in her honour.  Biography  Stateira was the daughter of the Persian nobleman Hydarnes. She married Artaxerxes II, the oldest son of Darius II of Persia and his wife Parysatis. Probably Darius II wanted to establish good relations with an important noble family, from which Stateira was descended, because her brother Terituchmes married Amestris, a daughter of Darius II. But Terituchmes loved one of his half-sisters more than his royal bride and tried to start a rebellion. Therefore, Parysatis had all the children of Hydarnes killed and only spared the life of Stateira at the request of her husband.Ctesias, Persica 55-56 (in an excerpt from Photius I of Constantinople). Artaxerxes II took over the Persian throne in 404 BC after the death of his father. Stateira seems to have been his only legal wife despite his numerous concubines. She bore a son, Artaxerxes, the heir to the throne, and probably other children. The queen mother Parysatis and Stateira tried to be the key political influence on the king; so the women became bitter rivals. Stateira was very popular with the people, allegedly because she left the curtains open when she drove in her carriage and because she talked to the ordinary people. She supported her husband in his quarrel with his brother Cyrus the Younger and criticized her sharp-tongued mother-in-law, because Parysatis had helped her favourite son Cyrus in his attempt to win the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II. Reportedly the intense hatred between the two women led Parysatis to encourage Artaxerxes II to take on concubines in order to hurt his wife. Stateira also publicly spoke up against the cruelties of the queen mother at the Persian court. For example, she criticized the brutal treatment of the eunuch Masabates and therefore intensified her conflict with Parysatis. Finally Parysatis had Stateira murdered. Classical sources give different reasons for this deed. According to one version Parysatis wanted to save the life of the Spartan commander Clearchus and his fellow-generals, who had been taken prisoner by Tissaphernes, but Stateira had succeeded in persuading her husband to execute the prisoners. Therefore, Parysatis is supposed to have poisoned Stateira. Plutarch, in his biography of Artaxerxes II, did not believe this story. According to another tradition Parysatis murdered her daughter-in-law because she realized that her son only felt true love for his wife. Plutarch reports that Parysatis performed the assassination with the help of a loyal servant named Gigis. She carved a bird with a poisoned knife in such a way that only one half of the animal was mixed with the poison. This half was served to Stateira when they were dining together. The poisoned meal caused the painful death of Stateira.Plutarch, Artaxerxes 5-6 and 17-19 (mainly based on Ctesias).  Notes   References  * Karl Fiehn: Stateira 1).

In England, deriving from the Old English (pear tree), referring to one who dwells by a pear tree, Retrieved 25 January 2014 while in Wales Perry, along with Parry, arose as patronymics, via a shortening of \\"ap Harry\\" (son of Harry). There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages (derived from the Latin): Pereira , Pereyra, Pereyro, Pereiro, Pereiros Pereire, Perera, Perer, Perero, Pereros; the Norman French (quarry), possibly referring to a quarryman. Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester, Essex, East England, such as Lexden and Copford. Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira, which means pear tree in Portuguese language.

The firm, founded in March 1990, is headquartered in Tokyo at the Ebisu Garden Place Tower. By late 2008, DMM was handling products from more than 150 different adult video studios, making it one of the largest AV distributors in Japan. The company interfaces with the public for sales and information as Outvision. Company information As of July 2007 DMM had 185 employees and total assets of 16,618,000,000 yen (about $166 million). Stockholders equity was 6,073,000,000 yen (about $60 million) and company capital amounted to 45 million yen (about $450,000). Sales for the fiscal year ending February 2007 were 28,366,000,000 yen (about $283 million) with sales for the 2008 fiscal year extrapolating to about 30 billion yen (about $300 million). Hokuto had a period of rapid growth from the time of its foundation with sales going from 5.1 billion yen (about $50 million) in fiscal year 2001 to 6.2 billion yen ($60 million) in 2002, 9.8 billion yen ($100 million) in 2003 and 12.3 billion yen ($125 million) in 2004. Under CEO Hiroyuki Shimazaki (Â≥∂Â¥éÂïì‰πã), DMM caught up with and surpassed its chief rival in AV sales, the Soft On Demand (SOD) group. Some companies which had formerly been part of SOD, including Dogma, Hajime-Kikaku and Aroma Planning, left SOD to become clients of DMM. According to the Japanese market research company Teikoku Databank, after this period of rapid growth, there was a sharp drop in sales at DMM, probably due to competition from internet porn sites. From a high of 32.4 billion yen (about $330 million) for fiscal year 2008, income dropped to less than half that amount for the 2010 fiscal year and rival SOD once again became the largest adult conglomerate in Japan. =DMM= The DMM Corporation (Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ„Éá„Ç∏„Çø„É´„É°„Éá„Ç£„Ç¢„Éû„Éº„Éà or \\"Digital Media Mart\\"), incorporated November 1999, is a major distributor of videos in Japan for both sales and rental, and also provides pay-per-view and downloadable digital adult content via its website dmm.co.jp. The director of DMM is Tatsuya Matsue (ÊùæÊ†ÑÁ´ã‰πü) and the company has a capital of ¬•30 million (about $300,000). The DMM website was opened in July 1998 and in September 2011 was ranked #30 in traffic for Japanese sites, #177 in Hong Kong, and #422 globally, with an audience slanted towards middle-aged men. As of September 2011, DMM had a catalog of more than 160,000 DVDs for sale, more than 200,000 adult videos available for rental and more than 130,000 videos for digital download. It also lists information on more than 30,000 AV actresses and compiles an annual list of the top 100 ranked actresses in sales from its site. In addition, the DMM site provides facilities for a large number of AV actress blogs. DMM also provided an English-language version, en.dmm.co.jp, for pay-per-view or monthly subscription downloads only, but it was discontinued on 29 April 2013. Nutaku partnership In December 2014, DMM partnered with Nutaku with the objective of marketing and publishing games to the western market.http://www.dmm.co.jp/en/netgame/foreign/ Nutaku is currently the sole distributor of DMM games outside Japan. Several DMM games have been translated in English and released on Nutaku:http://www.nutaku.net * Angelic Saga * Dragon Providence * Dragon Tactics Memories * Duel Squad * Girls Kingdom * Hellfire Girls * Hijitsu Chronicle * Kanpani Girls * Lord of Valkyrie * Luv Slot * Millennium War Aigis * Peropero Seduction * Ultra Adventure!

With over 200,000 movies available for VOD via streaming and downloading, it far surpasses other rival JAV sites. =AV Grand Prix= Upon the demise of the SOD-sponsored AV Open contest in 2007 owing to fraud, DMM started a new competition in 2008, the AV Grand Prix. Winners were determined by sales and by fan voting at the DMM website. The 2008 AV Grand Prix was a success with 77 studios competing and an even larger 2009 contest began in late 2008. = Companies in the DMM group = As of mid-2010, the DMM group included 20 studios producing gravure (non-nude) videos and another 19 units involved in adult toys.

It originally aired on December 8, 2008.  Plot  A bartender, Doug, gets Ted and Barney involved in a fight with a group of guys sitting in the gang's favorite booth. Marshall and Lily try to warn them off, but Barney vows to join in when Robin reveals that she thinks fights are sexy. Ted joins in as an experience he thinks he should have sometime in his life. When they arrive in the back alley, Doug has knocked out the guys single-handedly. Ted and Barney try to give him credit, but he insists they were in the fight as well. Afraid of appearing unmasculine, they take the credit after Barney creates \\"battle wounds\\" by blackening his own eye and punching Ted in the nose. They earn the admiration of everyone except Marshall, who claims that he used to fight with his brothers and Ted and Barney wouldn't stand a chance. Ted and Barney laugh it off, believing it to be gentle horseplay. Ted and Barney are sued by the losers of the fight. They admit to Marshall and the others that they had no role in the victory. Robin, who had been extremely attracted to Barney, cancels a date to a hockey match. Marshall gets the boys out of the lawsuit with their admission of no involvement. Doug is now the only person named in the suit and he plans to pulverize Ted and Barney for their betrayal. Barney runs away in fear. Doug brings up Stella leaving him and Ted punches Doug, who subsequently knocks him out cold. Marshall proves his earlier stories of fighting prowess by knocking out Doug with one blow; as it turns out his childhood fights with his brothers weren't gentle horseplay as the gang believed, but rather vicious brawls. Barney returns to find both Doug and Ted on the floor in pain. At school, Lily struggles with two kids in her class who are also fighting. First, she has Marshall come to class to preach pacifism, but the kids call him a wuss. She later has Ted come to class after he has been hit by Doug to preach the consequences of fighting. The kids are still unmoved. Marshall is shown with Lily at his mother's house 3‚Äì5 years later for Thanksgiving and he pulls out a lightsaber to carve the turkey.

He was the last man executed in South Australia when he was hanged in Adelaide Gaol for the murder of Richard Strang. Early life Born Graham Paul Fraser, he changed his name as a teenager to Glen Sabre Valance after Liberty Valance, the title character of a 1962 western film. Crime In the early hours of 16 June 1964, Valance tied up three station hands at the Koonroon property near Bordertown, South Australia then entered the bedroom of Richard and Suzanne Strang. Valance shot and killed Richard as he slept and then raped his wife. Valance escaped by car and drove towards Adelaide. Suzanne called the police and Valance was captured at a road block near Murray Bridge. The rifle was in the car with him. Trial and execution Dates of last executions & abolition Valance claimed he had a grievance with Richard Strang: he once worked for Strang, but was sacked after being accused of theft. Strang had legal proceedings against Valance accusing him of theft, while Valance claimed Strang had owed him money and refused to pay, further blaming Strang for having his car repossessed. Valance pleaded insanity, but was found guilty and sentenced to death by South Australian state Chief Justice Sir Mellis Napier on 17 September 1964. The Supreme Court of South Australia dismissed his appeal on 9 October and a further application to the High Court of Australia for leave to appeal was rejected on 9 November. The death sentence was carried out on 24 November 1964. Valance was hanged at Adelaide jail in a guard tower that had been converted into an execution facility by the installation of a gallows in 1950 (the \\"Hanging Tower\\") and was the newest gallows in Australia after the one at Fannie Bay, Darwin (1952). The gallows survives, and the date 24 November 1964 and the letters GSV still remain painted on the inner perimeter wall above the grave, in the area of the prison set aside for burial of executed prisoners. Valance was the last man executed in South Australia, and the second to last in Australia; the last was Ronald Ryan, who was executed in Victoria on 3 February 1967.

Ralph Leavitt's customer traded his steam automobile for a new model, which promptly broke down. He had dealer Leavitt arrested, who fled to his Maine home Ralph J. Leavitt (born 1877, date of death unknown) was an early New York City automobile dealer charged with fraud who successfully avoided arrest over a period of months, both in New York City and in his native York Harbor, Maine, where he fled, and where he tied his speedboat to a buoy, threatening officers with a pistol. Leavitt's flight from justice was chronicled in the newspapers of the day. Leavitt set off the mad dash after jumping bail in 1905 in Manhattan, where he was charged with fraud in connection with a trade-in at his Manhattan car dealership, the Leavitt Motor Power Exchange. In a chase-scene reported blow-by-blow in The New York Times, Leavitt was said to have barely escaped capture in New York, and then fled northward to Maine. Surprised by detectives at his Maine home, Leavitt took to his boat in York Harbor, \\"defying officers and threatening to shoot the first man who dared to molest him,\\" after which \\"he came ashore and disappeared,\\" The New York Times reported.Leavitt Escapes Again, Eludes Officers By Landing from His Launch at Midnight, The New York Times, May 27, 1906 Earlier Leavitt had moored to a buoy, \\"prepared to keep away all hostile persons by use of his revolver.\\" In an era before cable news networks, the hijinks of the New York car dealer kept a nation riveted. A day after The New York Times informed its readers that the scofflaw Leavitt had taken to his launch to evade arrest, The Times announced in a front-page headline: \\"HOW LEAVITT HELD OUT AGAINST ALL COMERS.\\" In smaller serif print, the newspaper of record noted that \\"Armed in His Launch, He Defied Beardsley and His Sleuths.\\" (\\"EVEN THE SHERIFF DAUNTED\\" was the subhead.) And below that the Times noted that the \\"Auto Dealer Raised Such Serious Objections to Arrest That Detectives Returned to This City.\\") The wily auto dealer, according to The Times, had outwitted even Hubert T.E. Beardsley of the American Bonding Company. \\"The next time he goes in pursuit of Ralph J. Leavitt,\\" said the Times of Beardsley, \\"he will take a squadron of cavalry if the chase is by land, or a torpedo boat, if the seas or other bodies of water have to be traversed.\\" Beardsley's adventure, according to The Times, began when Toledo, Ohio-bound New York real estate mogul Robert G. Kelsey picked up a car from Leavitt's dealership. The automobile \\"fell to pieces as soon as it was on the road,\\" and Kelsey, learning that Leavitt had already sold the steam-driven model he'd traded in, had Leavitt arrested. Ralph Leavitt subsequently made bail, was released, and fled to his old Maine haunts, whereupon bondsman Beardsley set off for Maine in hot pursuit, along with four other detectives. Arriving in York Harbor, Maine, Beardsley and his detectives asked directions to the Leavitt homestead in York Corners, some seven miles inland. On arriving at the Leavitt home, the bondsman reminded auto dealer Leavitt that he was a fugitive, and asked Leavitt to come quietly. \\"Leavitt laughed long and loud,\\" according to The New York Times, saying that \\"no one in the present company could put handcuffs on him. Leavitt took down from the mantel a revolver, and repeated that he didn't think that anyone present wanted to handcuff him.\\"HOW LEAVITT HELD OUT AGAINST ALL COMERS, The New York Times, May 27, 1906 The New York detective tried a different approach. \\"Mr. Beardsley tried tact, artifice and diplomacy,' said The Times. \\"Mr. Leavitt softened. He laid aside his resolve and invited his visitors to have a bite to eat while he went upstairs to prepare himself for the journey to New York.\\" Minutes passed, and when the New York detectives went upstairs to locate Leavitt, they discovered the car dealer had fled, taking to his yacht. Beardsley and the detectives followed.

Subsequent to this exchange, according to comments made by Saudi cleric Awad Al-Qarni and reiterated by Prince Khaled, one Israeli family offered $100,000 for the capture of a Palestinian man released under the deal who they believed was responsible for the 1998 death of one of their relatives.$1 million for the catch ‚Äì Saudi royal boosts bounty on Israeli soldier 30 October 2011, RT News.

As of late October 2011, news agencies were reporting at least two such $100,000 bounties on-offer by Israeli extremist groups for the killing of Palestinians who were released in the exchange and who they believe to have been responsible for the killing of Israelis.Saudi royal offers bounty on Israeli soldiers 30 October 2011, Associated Press, via CBS News. Excerpt: In Israel, extremists have offered two rewards of $100,000 to anyone who kills a Palestinian released in the Shalit deal if the Palestinian killed Israelis... Extremist settler activist Baruch Marzel said he was familiar with the bounties and that there were a number of bereaved Israeli families who were looking to \\"settle the score\\" with the killers. Controversy As part of conservative wing in Saudi royal family, Khaled said he had been forced to speak out after quiet efforts to advise his brother to mend his ways had fallen on deaf ears. Khaled, told an Arabic website that his brother's plan to introduce cinema into Saudi society was the straw that broke the camel's back. This was a reference to a Saudi film financed by Al-Waleed bin Talal, and shown in Saudi Arabia in 2011 despite fierce opposition from Islamist activists. On 29 October 2011, Prince Khaled stated that he would give $900,000 for the capture of any Israeli soldier for use as bargaining leverage in potential future negotiations with Israel for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, variously estimated in late October 2011 as between 5,000 and 7,000 persons. Details provided about his announcement varied considerably among the many media outlets that covered it, with some apparent contradictions among them, and with some reports excluding any mention of the previous bounty offers made by Israeli groups that the Prince said prompted his offer.Montrealers celebrate release of Israeli soldier .

In what he described as a response to the $100,000 bounty offered by the Israeli family as described above, Saudi cleric Awad Al-Qarni offered his own bounty in the same $100,000 amount for the capture of any Israeli soldier, with the understanding that any soldier so captured would be used in a potential subsequent prisoner exchange to try to secure the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians who remain in Israeli prisons.Saudi prince backs cleric's bounty offer for Israeli soldier . 29 October 2011, Reuters.

However, whereas Zar'roc is crimson in appearance, Brisingr is blue, with its blade, guard, hilt and scabbard each being a different hue.

During their time in Du Weldenvarden, he and his dragon Glaedr stored vast amounts of energy into the sword's gem, a yellow diamond. Several elves also contributed energy to the point where there was said to be enough raw power contained within the sword to shift an entire mountain. Oromis used the sword in his duel with Eragon.

Fred Saberhagen: Books of the Swords  *The Twelve Swords of Power: Each possesses a unique magic property, were forged by Vulcan and capriciously scattered across a world in which technology had been replaced by magic and the deities of classical antiquity returned. *Coinspinner: the Sword of Chance - Symbol: dice *Doomgiver: the Sword of Justice - Symbol: hollow circle *Dragonslicer: the Sword of Heroes - Symbol: dragon *Farslayer: the Sword of Vengeance - Symbol: target; that is concentric rings *Mindsword: the Sword of Glory - Symbol: generic banner *Shieldbreaker: the Sword of Force - Symbol: hammer *Sightblinder: the Sword of Stealth - Symbol: human eye *Soulcutter: the Sword of Despair - Symbol: none *Stonecutter: the Sword of Siege - Symbol: a wedge, splitting a block *Townsaver: the Sword of Fury - Symbol: crenelated wall *Wayfinder: the Sword of Wisdom - Symbol: small white arrow *Woundhealer: the Sword of Mercy - Symbol: open hand  Brandon Sanderson: Cosmere  *Shardblades: Featured in The Stormlight Archive, shardblades are usually two handed swords capable of cutting through any nonliving material. Living beings that are struck by shardblades are not cut, but the wound causes an injury to the soul instead. Wounds from shardblades cause the affected area to go limp and become useless. Shardblades can be summoned by a wielder who has bonded one. Some characters are able to summon shardblades through a connection with supernatural creatures known as spren. A prominent shardblade, Oathbringer, is the namesake of the third book in the Stormlight Archive, which partially explores the sword's history with several of the main characters. *Honorblades: The oldest known shardblades, given to a group of immortal beings known as Heralds by their namesake god and creator, Honor. Unlike typical shardblades, Honorblades grant their wielders the supernatural abilities of one of the orders of the Knights Radiant. The powers vary depending on the Honorblade that is used. *Nightblood: First featured in Warbreaker, Nightblood is a sentient sword that can communicate with its wielder. Drawing Nightblood usually causes those in the sword's vicinity to try and kill each other to claim the sword for themselves. Nightblood, when used, is capable of destroying almost any known foe or object, but its power consumes the essence or soul of the wielder, making its use incredibly dangerous. Nightblood itself has a somewhat innocent, almost childlike personality, appropriately unaware of many things about the world around it. Nightblood is bound by a single command: \\"Destroy evil,\\" which because of its limited understanding of concepts of morality, causes some confusion when used in battle. *Koloss blades: Featured in the first trilogy of Mistborn books, these massive swords are used by ogre-like monsters known as koloss. The blades are too massive for any normal human to wield (Though some magic users can increase their strength and do so). The number of swords that a koloss band has influences that band's hierarchy. Due to the brutal lifestyle of the koloss and their generally low intelligence, the blades are not well maintained or even kept sharp, rendering many blunt, albeit still quite dangerous.  J. R. R. Tolkien: Middle-earth  *Glamdring: (Sindarin: foe- hammer) Nicknamed \\"Beater\\" by the Goblins. First owned and wielded by Turgon, king of Gondolin, it was later wielded by Gandalf the White. *Narsil: (Quenya: red fire-white brilliance; refers to the Sun and Moon as the great lights of the heavens) The sword of Elendil, broken when Elendil falls on it during his battle with Sauron. The hilt-shard is used to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand by Isildur, Elendil's second son. The broken sword is an heirloom of the House of Elendil, and eventually comes into Aragorn's possession as the latest heir to the thrones of Arnor and Gondor. It is reforged and renamed And√∫ril (Quenya: West-brilliance, usually rendered as the Flame of the West), fulfilling the prophecy that it shall be forged anew when the One Ring is found again. And√∫ril serves as Aragorn's primary weapon and as a symbol of good to all who oppose Sauron. It is the literary opposite of the One Ring. *Orcrist: (Sindarin: orc/goblin-cleaver) Called \\"Biter\\" by the orcs; used by Thorin Oakenshield. *Ringil: (Quenya: cold-star) The sword of Fingolfin, king of the Noldor elves; used during his duel with Morgoth, the Great Enemy. *Sting: An Elven knife used as a sword by Bilbo, and later his nephew, Frodo. Sting has the characteristic of glowing when orcs are near, thus serving as an alert to its wielder. *Anglachel (Sindarin: iron-fire-star) and Anguirel (Sindarin: iron-eternal-star): Swords forged from meteoritic iron by E√∂l, the dark elf. They could cleave all earth delved iron. *Gurthang: (Sindarin: death-iron) The sword formerly known as Anglachel. So named by T√∫rin Turambar, who wielded the sword until his suicide upon Gurthang's point. The sword is notable for apparently being sentient; it appeared to mourn the death of its former owner, the elf Beleg C√∫thalion, and it spoke in response to being hailed by T√∫rin just before his death. It was found to have broken under T√∫rin after his death and the shards were buried with him. *Herugrim: (Rohirric: very fierce, savage) The sword of Th√©oden, king of Rohan. *Aranr√∫th: (Sindarin: king's-ire) The sword of Thingol, King of Doriath in Beleriand. *G√∫thwin√´: (Rohirric: battle-friend) The sword of √âomer. *Barrow-blade: The blades wielded by Frodo Baggins (until he obtained Sting), Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took; given to them by Tom Bombadil from a tomb on the Barrow-downs. Swords only appearing in the film adaptations: *Hadhafang: Elrond's sword from the Second Age. *Lhang: A variety of two- handed, curved bladed swords used by Elves.  Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman: Darksword  *The Darksword: A sword wielded by Joram. It is made of darkstone/iron, which has the ability to absorb Life (magic). Weapons forged from darkstone need to be infused with Life from a catalyst and can only be effectively wielded by the Dead (devoid of magical power), who have no magic to be absorbed.  Tad Williams: Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn  Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn are three legendary swords key to the plot of the trilogy. Memory is also known as Minneyar, \\"Year of Memory\\".  Gene Wolfe: The Book of the New Sun  *Terminus Est: The sword carried by Severian, the Torturer. It contains liquid metal (mercury, but referred to by its Latin name hydrargyrum) within the blade, making it hard to lift and giving more power on the downswing.  Roger Zelazny: The Chronicles of Amber  *Grayswandir: A sword used by Corwin of Amber.

Andrzej Sapkowski: The Witcher  * Zirael (in Elder Speech: Swallow) is a sword given to Ciri by the blacksmith Esterhazy. Leo Bonhart, who enthralled Ciri, wanted to buy this sword for Ciri and make her fight in arenas. Zirael was a gwyhyr, which is a type of sword produced by gnomes. On the sword's blade is the elvish glyph Blathanna Caerme (in Elder Speech: Destiny Wreath). * Sihill was a sword made by dwarves. According to the Witcher Saga, Sihill's first owner was the dwarf Zoltan Chivay, who gave the sword to witcher Geralt of Riva. It has the dwarven glyph on it, which says: For damnation of whoresons.

Jade Harley wields it temporarily. =Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda= *Master Sword: From \\"The Legend of Zelda\\", also referred to as \\"the Blade of Evil's Bane\\" and \\"the Sword that Seals the Darkness\\". It said that no one with an evil heart can even wield the blade. It also said that only a member or a descendant of the bloodline of the Knights of Hyrule can pull it from its pedestal. It is often wielded by the various incarnations of the hero, Link in order to defend Hyrule from Ganon and other evil forces. In some games, when at full power the blade shines with the power to repel evil and protects its wielder from certain types of harmful magic such as the Shadow Crystal from Twilight Princess. Before Skyward Sword, the sword's exact origins and when it was created where unclear leading to contradictory explanations for its existence. In Skyward Sword it is revealed that the Goddess Sword created by the Goddess Hylia to aid the chosen hero, containing the spirit of Fi, was later forged into the Master Sword through the efforts of the Link of Skyloft and was ultimately used to defeat the Demon King Demise, though it is implied that as a result Demise's hatred towards Link & Zelda would continue to be reincarnated in the form of the evil, Ganon. In Breath of the Wild, the sword becomes rusted and battle-worn during the Great Calamity while Link is fighting Guardians and is placed by Princess Zelda in its pedestal in Korok Forest where it is protected by the Great Deku Tree and the Korok forest spirits after Link is injured and placed in stasis. Zelda reveals the sword's spirit spoke to her and told her that her destiny is not finished, giving her the resolve to confront and seal herself with Calamity Ganon to keep him sealed while Link recovers. One hundred years later after Link awakens from stasis, he finds it in Korok Forest but learns that the sword will test him to see if he is worthy to wield it and will sap his health as he tries to remove it forcing Link to obtain enough heart containers to remove it. The Great Deku Tree confirms it is of divine origins indicating that he is aware of its true origins. It is stated in-game that the sword's spirit Fi is delighted to be in Link's possession echoing her words about hoping to met Link again from the end of Skyward Sword. However, Fi herself does not make a physical appearance and is never mentioned by name, though the game strongly implies her spirit is still present and conscious within the blade. The Master Sword cannot be dropped or removed from Link's inventory and has its own weapon inventory slot. The sword will be rendered temporarily unusable for a time if its power is used too much which is designed to fit with the breakable weapons mechanic of Breath of the Wild. When in the presence of corrupted Guardians or Ganon's incarnations it true power shines causing the blade to glow increasing its attack damage and durability. Its true power state can be unlocked permanently by completing the DLC Side Quest \\"EX Trial of the Sword\\" which appears as part of \\"The Master Trials Pack\\" DLC. *Fierce Deity Sword: From \\"The Legend of Zelda\\", is a large, peculiar greatsword with a unique double-helix design which has caused it to become known as the \\"Double-Helix Sword\\" among fans before it was officially named in Breath of the Wild. Like the Biggoron Sword, it is wielded two-handed. The blade first appears in Majora's Mask where it is the main weapon wielded by Link in his Fierce Deity form that is the result of Link wearing the powerful Fierce Deity's Mask which is obtained from the Lunar Child that wears Majora's Mask after trading all non-transformation masks to the other Lunar Children. Majora Mask's Child claims the mask represents the True Bad Guy and is implied to possess dark power greater than Majora's Mask and transforms Link into a white-haired, pupil-less, god-like being that resembles his adult form from Ocarina of Time that wields the two-handed Fierce Deity Sword. Link can only use the mask and sword when fighting bosses and allows Link to fire sword beams with magic power. The sword makes another appearance in \\"Tri Force Heroes\\" where it appears when Link wears the Fierce Deity Armor outfit which makes Link look like the Fierce Deity and turns his sword into the Fierce Deity Sword when worn. In \\"Breath of the Wild\\", it was officially named the Fierce Deity Sword and for the first time in the main series appears as an equipable weapon. It appears as a special weapon that can be obtained randomly via using a specific amiibo with the amiibo Rune after completing one of the four Divine Beast dungeons, however like all weapons in Breath of the Wild, it will eventually break, though can be reacquired through using the amiibo again. Link can also obtain a related armor set that makes him look like the Fierce Deity which can be obtained using the same amiibo that unlocks the Fierce Deity Sword. It is described in-game as \\"A peculiar greatsword allegedly used by a hero from a world in which the moon threatened to fall. It slashes wildly in battle as if possessed by a fierce deity.\\". *Four Sword: From \\"The Legend of Zelda\\", another sword wielded by Link that has the power to split its wielder into four copies. In Minish Cap, it is revealed to have been forged by the Minish. *Sword of Sages: From \\"The Legend of Zelda\\", it is a holy sword created by the Six Ancient Sages to execute and seal away the Dark Lord Ganondorf. It first appeared in \\"Twilight Princess\\" during a flashback of Ganondorf's failed execution. The ancient sages used the sword in an attempt to execute Ganondorf, though as if by some divine prank Ganondorf chosen by destiny to wield the power of the gods (implied to be the Triforce of Power) and Ganondorf survives his execution and removes the blade which leaves a glowing wound that never heals. However, unlike the Master Sword, the blade can be wielded by evil beings as Ganondorf uses it to kill the Ancient Sage of Water after his failed execution forcing the remain five sages to banish Ganondorf in the Twilight Realm using the Mirror of Twilight where Ganondorf encounters Zant who worships him as a god and helps him overthrow Twilight Princess Midna and take over the Twilight Realm, then invade Hyrule. Ganondorf keeps the blade with him when he returns to Hyrule, despite considering it \\"foul\\" due to its holy power and use in his attempted execution, though poetically states he plans to use to blot out the light from Hyrule. It is used by Ganondorf to counter the Master Sword during his and Link's final battle as its holy nature means it is not affected by the Master Sword's power to repel evil. However, the wound it caused to Ganondorf remains a weak point and afflicts Ganondorf for the remainder of his life until he is killed by Link at which time it stops glowing as Ganondorf dies. The sword's fate after his defeat is unclear. In Breath of the Wild, it is named the Sword of the Six Sages and for the first time appears as a sword that can be wielded by Link, though as a two-handed weapon implying that it is quite heavy (presumably Ganondorf could wield it one-handed due to his unnatural strength and power). It appears as a special weapon that can be obtained randomly via using a specific amiibo with the amiibo Rune after completing one of the four Divine Beast dungeons, however like all weapons in Breath of the Wild it will eventually break, though it can be reacquired through using the amiibo again. *Biggoron Sword: From \\"The Legend of Zelda\\", is a greatsword forged by the giant Goron blacksmith, Biggoron. It is so large that Link must wield it with two hands, preventing him from using his shield. There is an identical blade called the \\"Giant's Knife\\" made by Biggoron's brother Medigoron in Goron City, though unlike the Biggoron Sword which is unbreakable, the Giant's Knife will break after a certain number of hits and Link cannot purchase it from Medigoron if he has obtained the Biggoron Sword. In Ocarina of Time, it deals twice as much damage as the Master Sword, though at the cost of being unable to use Link's shield. In Breath of the Wild, it appears as a special weapon that can be obtained randomly via using a specific amiibo with the amiibo Rune after completing one of the four Divine Beast dungeons, however like all weapons in Breath of the Wild it will eventually break, though can be reacquired through using the amiibo again. =Nintendo's Fire Emblem= *Falchion: A sword from the Fire Emblem series, it is wielded by Marth, the prince of Altea in Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, Alm in Fire Emblem Gaiden, Chrom, the prince of Ylisse in Fire Emblem Awakening, and Lucina, the princess of Ylisse in Awakening. *Tyr *Mystletainn: *Balmung: *Durandal: *Binding Blade: *Sieglinde: *Ragnell: A weapon in \\"Fire Emblem\\", it is Ike's main weapon of choice in the game \\"Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance\\" and \\"Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn\\".

Long before the events of the game, there was a war between twelve dragons. One of the dragons, the Rainbow Sage, forged five divine weapons: Yato, Raijinto, Fujin Yumi, Siegfried, and Brynhildr. Humanity was selected to wield these weapons, which plunged them into the war. If the Yato and one of the other weapons collide their powers together, the Yato will gain a new form, depending on the weapons it collides with. If the Yato collides with all of the weapons, it will transform into its true form, the Omega Yato. *Raijinto: A sword in \\"Fire Emblem Fates\\", it was originally wielded by the former king of Hoshido, Sumeragi, but is now wielded by his son, Ryoma, the high prince of Hoshido.

However eventually its origins were forgotten among the Kaioshin, as the Supreme Kai Shin was completely unaware that Elder Kai was sealed in it and it was stuck inside a pillar-shaped rock where many such as Kibito have tried to remove it without success. During the Majin Buu Saga, Supreme Kai brings Son Gohan to the Sacred World of the Kais believing Gohan can remove it and that wielding it will allow Gohan to awaken his true power. It is implied that a sword in the Stone-like myth has grown among the Kaioshin and Gohan even mentions reading a similar legendary sword in a stone that supposedly exists on Earth (presumably refer Excalibur or the Sword in the Stone). Gohan removes the sword but both he and initially skeptical Kibito finds it is extremely heavy. Eventually, Gohan manages to get the hang of wielding while training with it and is eventually joined on the Sacred World of the Kais by his father, the series' main protagonist Son Goku who, after learning of his son's survival, tracks him down using Instant Transmission. Goku later decides to help out with Gohan's sword-training. It was later broken by the Goku and Gohan, while Gohan was training with the sword, freeing the Elder Kaioshin who aids the Z-Fighters providing his ability to unlock Gohan's hidden potential and knowledge of Potara Fusion to Goku, as well as transferring his own life force to the deceased Goku so he could fight against the evil Majin Buu. The Z Sword appears as both an item and a weapon in various Dragon Ball video games. In Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Old Kai is shown to hold a grudge against Beerus for sealing him in the Z-Sword and even complains about all that he has missed while trapped in it to the game's protagonist. At one point during the game's story, Whis even suggests to Beerus sealing Old Kai in the Z Sword again to relieve his anger and frustration over Towa manipulating him during the battle against Golden Frieza. *Brave Sword: From \\"Dragon Ball Z\\" is a longsword used by Tapion and Kid Trunks in the DBZ film \\"Wrath of the Dragon\\" and is depicted as a mystical weapon forged by a Konatsian Wizard to combat Hirudegarn who was cut in two by the blade and sealed with Tapion and his brother. The sword was sealed with Tapion who uses it when he is freed by Goku and his friends at the request of Hoi, who is, in reality, an evil Kashvar a rare of wizards who wish to exterminate all other lifeforms and created Hirudegarn for that purpose. After Hirudegarn escapes, Tapion manages to seal the entire beast in himself and requests that Trunks use the sword to kill him and Hirudegarn, though Trunks hesitates and the monster escapes only to be defeated by Super Saiyan 3 Goku's Dragon Fist technique. Afterward, Tapion gives the sword to Trunks whom he had formed a brother-like bond. It is implied that Trunks later uses this sword as an adult in Dragon Ball GT. It resembles the sword used by Future Trunks in DBZ, though it is unlikely that they are the same weapon. It has been referred to as the \\"Tapion's Sword\\" or the Brave Sword in *Sword of Chaos: The sword wielded by Sarevok during the events of Baldur's Gate, and acquired by the protagonist in Baldur's Gate: Shadows of Amn (Forgotten Realms). *Keyblade: The weapon Sora wields in \\"Kingdom Hearts\\".

The handle is in the shape of a large red dragon's head and the blade is an ethereal blade of yellow-orange flame that can be adjusted in length. Thus the sword as a whole resembles a dragon breathing fire. It is used by Lloyd to kill the Jade Dragoon, Lavitz. It is later used by the Dark Dragoon, Rose, and Red Dragoon, Zieg, to kill the wingly, Melbu Frahma. *Buster Sword: Cloud Strife's initial weapon in Final Fantasy VII, it is a large and rather simple greatsword.

It was given only to someone who could be exalted as the \\"perfect knight\\", the strongest, bravest and truest knight of an era, which signifies the unrivaled Lancelot out of all those who sat at the Round Table of Camelot. *Excalibur Galatine: The shining sword that Sir Gawain possesses. It is the sister-sword of Excalibur also originally owned by the Lady of the Lake, but it is not as well known as a holy sword and rarely mentioned due to having its legend hidden in the shadow of King Arthur's holy sword. While Excalibur collects the lights from the planet, Sir Gawain's holy sword is said to represent the rays of heat from the sun with a Pseudo-Sun contained in the hilt *Caladbolg: The sword wielded by Fergus mac R√≥ich, with which he redirected his anger at not being able to kill the one who tricked him out of kingship by cleaninly blasting the top of three hills like a long rainbow. * Kanshou and Bakuya: \\"Married\\" twin swords forged by Gan Jiang and Mo Ye, they represent Ying and Yang. The main ability of the swords is their strong bond with each other, which not only allows them to attract each other, but it is also said they will return their owner even if events cause them to be lost. If one is thrown while the other is held, the thrown sword will return to the wielder much like a boomerang. They are wielded by Servant Archer. * Ea: The single most powerful weapon in existence, Ea can ‚Äì at full power ‚Äì destroy the entire world. It is something that was born before the appearance of the concept that the world calls a \\"sword\\", so it is not something that can truly be called a sword or have the shape of any known blade and it is the only sword that does not exist in the current world. It is something that does not appear in any modern legends, crystallized during the Age of Gods at the beginning of the world. It is possessed by Gilgamesh, and is the only sword that Archer and Emiya cannot Trace. * Merodach:The Original Sin ( ÂéüÁΩ™„É°„É≠„ÉÄ„ÉÉ„ÇØ, GenzaiMerodakku) is the original model of the \\"legends of swords of selection in the various lands of the world\\" and \\"the foundation of the sacred right to select the king\\", including Gram and the sword modeled on Gram, Caliburn.

It utilizes the same power as Caliburn, a \\"light that can burn away everything it touches\\" * Durandal: The Peerless Sword is the holy sword favored by Roland and one of the many Noble Phantasms stored in Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon. The sword is a splendidly forged \\"symbol of power\\" much like King Arthur's Caliburn, and it is said to hold three miracles within it. It will not lose its sharpness even should its user's magical energy be depleted, proving indestructible even when Roland tried to destroy it. * Harpe: Immortal Slaying Scythe is a divine sword from Greek mythology used by Perseus to kill the Gorgon Medusa.

Since the merger, the railroad has improved service and infrastructure on lines with customer growth potential; weaker lines were abandoned or sold off. of track was returned to service. A yard was also constructed in Pocopson, Pennsylvania along the Wilmington & Northern (W&N;). ESPN has acquired additional locomotives and replaced older locomotives to handle increased traffic, including the acquisition of two rebuilt EMD GP38-2's from GATX to be used along the W&N; and Octoraro lines. ESPN attempted to abandon the Colebrookdale line between Pottstown and Boyertown in 2008; it was eventually purchased by Berks County. In 2010, the Chester Valley line between King of Prussia and Bridgeport was abandoned and subsequently sold to Montgomery County so that it can become a part of the Chester Valley Rail Trail. On August 1, 2011, the East Penn Railroad began operations on the York Industrial Track between York and Stony Brook, taking over operations from Norfolk Southern. In December 2012, the former Raritan River 40' boxcar #100, stored on East Penn tracks at its Quakertown depot, was restored, one of the few surviving pieces of equipment from the former Raritan River Railroad.

Moosally (born 4 October 1944) is a former captain in the United States Navy. During his naval career, Moosally served in many different assignments, including commander of a destroyer and the battleship . Moosally was captain of the Iowa when the center gun of one of the ship's main gun turrets exploded on April 19, 1989, killing 47 crewmen. During the investigation into the cause of the explosion, Moosally testified that the Navy had assigned personnel of inferior quality to the Iowa. The investigation found that Iowa had been operating with severe deficiencies in safety and training procedures, for which Moosally was disciplined. The Navy stated that the deficiencies were unrelated to the turret explosion. In December 1989 in testimony before the United States Senate Armed Services Committee, Moosally declined to fully support the Navy's conclusion that the explosion had been intentionally caused by Clayton Hartwig, one of the turret's crewmen. Moosally's testimony was widely reported in the media. Moosally retired from the Navy soon after in May 1990. In 1999, Moosally began working for Lockheed Martin. In 2002 he was appointed president of the company's MS2 division. In this capacity, Moosally has helped lead Lockheed Martin's involvement in the and Integrated Deepwater System programs. Moosally led MS2 from a $1B organization to a $4B+ organization when he retired in January 2010. Moosally was succeeded by Orlando Carvahlo, former General Manager and Vice President of the Lockheed Martin MS2 Moorestown, New Jersey site. It was announced on 12 February 2010 that Moosally was hired as President and Chief Executive Officer of Fincantieri Marine Group (FMG), a subsidiary of Fincantieri-Cantieri Navali Italiani S.p.A. Early life and education Moosally, born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio,Schwoebel p. 258 was one of six children in a family of three sons and three daughters. His father was an insurance salesman and the family attended the local Syriac Maronite Church.Thompson, p. 36. At Ursuline High School, according to Charles Thompson, Moosally played American football. A defensive tackle, he was selected as a second-string member of the all-city squad. Moosally also lifted weights, ran track, and played summer baseball. He graduated high school in 1962Thompson, pp. 35‚Äì36. and was recruited by Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh to play football. He instead decided to attend the United States Naval Academy after speaking with the academy's football coach, Bill Elias. Moosally played defensive tackle on the academy's football team. In 1964 he and the team played in the Cotton Bowl Classic. One of Moosally's teammates in the game was Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach. In 1965 Moosally was awarded the Annapolis Touchdown Club's Silver Helmet trophy as the team's Most Valuable Player and was selected to play in the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic. Only free preview online.Thompson, pp. 35‚Äì40. Moosally graduated in 1966 with a class ranking of 812 out of 868. His classmates nicknamed him \\"Moose\\" because of his physical presence and his \\"slap-on-the-back\\" personality.Lockheed Martin, \\"Lockheed Martin appoints Fred P. Moosally\\", Schwoebel p. 258, Thompson, p. 35‚Äì40. At a later, unknown date, Moosally received a master's degree in finance from Central Michigan University. Naval career Moosally's first tour after commissioning as an ensign was on the destroyer in which he spent some time off the coast of Vietnam. He attended destroyer department head school at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island and was assigned to the destroyer . In 1971, Moosally returned to the Naval Academy, where he worked in the recruitment and candidate guidance office. He also worked with the varsity football team. After turning 30 years old, Moosally was assigned to the frigate as the ship's executive officer. The ship's captain was (then) Lieutenant Commander William J. \\"Bud\\" Flanagan who would later become a four-star admiral and commander of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet.Thompson, pp. 36‚Äì37. After the Bronstein Moosally was assigned to Washington, D.C. in the Navy's Bureau of Naval Personnel, where he worked for Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf, III. He was subsequently assigned to the destroyer as executive officer. After Mahan, Moosally was promoted to commander and was assigned to work for the Navy's Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) office as a surface-warfare program coordinator. Two years later, he became administrative assistant and aide to the CNO, Thomas B. Hayward.Thompson, pp. 37‚Äì38. USS KiddBy this time, Moosally was considered to be very well-connected politically with many of the Navy's top admirals, mainly because of tours on the staffs of Metcalf and Hayward. In 1985, Moosally began a tour as commander of the destroyer . Metcalf later said he thought Moosally did \\"a terrific job\\" as skipper of Kidd.Schwoebel p. 258; Thompson pp. 35‚Äì38. After Kidd, Moosally worked in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. His supervisor was an Academy football teammate, Rear Admiral Thomas Lynch. In this position, Moosally was successful in helping lobby for congressional approval and funding for two new aircraft carriers, two frigates, and a nuclear-powered cruiser for the Navy. Jim Hickey, a congressional aide at the time, said of Moosally, \\"He's intelligent, politically savvy and well respected not only by the people in the liaison office but by the Navy folks as well.\\"Thompson, pp. 38‚Äì39. Moosally then requested the command of one of the newly reactivated s. His request was supported by Metcalf, (then) Rear Admiral \\"Bud\\" Flanagan, Rear Admiral Richard Milligan (the Navy battle group commander in Charleston, South Carolina), and (then) Rear Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda. The CNO at that time, Admiral Carlisle Trost, apparently agreed, and the request was granted; Moosally was assigned to command .Thompson, p. 39. USS Iowa =Takes command= USS Iowa, photographed in 1984On May 23, 1988, Moosally took command of Iowa at Norfolk, Virginia. Reportedly, Moosally favored Iowas missile and engineering systems and deemphasized 16-inch gunnery. A week after taking command, Moosally and his executive officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned one million dollar repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs to the main gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems; seventy-five detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant.Schwoebel p. 259; Thompson pp. 46‚Äì47. One of the deficiencies needing repairs was the sprinkler system in Turret 2, including the ones in the powder magazines, intended to help put out any propellant fires, were inoperable. After completion of the overhaul Moosally took Iowa on a shakedown cruise around Chesapeake Bay on August 25, 1988. Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water, Iowa, with Moosally at the helm, narrowly missed colliding with the , , and before, Thompson claims, running aground in soft mud outside the bay's main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals. After one hour, Iowa was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port. Although other US Navy vessels observed Iowa grounded in the mud, the incident apparently was not acted upon by Moosally's superiors.Thompson, pp. 58‚Äì60. According to Thompson, the near- misses with the other navy ships were recorded in Iowas log as attempts to \\"render honors\\" to them. Mike Fahey, the ship's executive officer, warned the other officers on Iowa to never mention the grounding to anyone, including superior Navy officers. Throughout August and September, Iowa continued with sea trials, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.Thompson, pp. 65‚Äì67. Between September 1988 and January 1989, Iowas crew did not conduct much training with the 16-inch guns, in part because of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to Ensign Dan Meyer, officer in charge of the ship's Turret One, morale and operational readiness among the gun turret crews suffered greatly. In spite of the problems with the main gun turrets, the ship passed its Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation in October 1988.Thompson, pp. 67‚Äì69.Vistica p. 289 =Gun experiments= In January 1989 Iowas Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, and Gunnery Officer, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Michael Costigan, persuaded Moosally to allow them to experiment with increasing the range of the main guns using \\"supercharged\\" powder bags and specially designed shells. Moosally was led to believe, falsely, that top officials from Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) had authorized the experiments. In fact, John McEachren, a mid-level bureaucrat with NAVSEA, had given the go-ahead to conduct the experiments, even though he had no authority to do so. McEachren concealed his approval of the gunnery experiments from his superiors.Thompson, pp. 63, 69‚Äì71, 346‚Äì47. Several of the officers and non- commissioned officers in charge of the main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of and numerous maintenance problems with the main guns and gun turrets. Meyer complained to Lieutenant Commander Roger John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Moosally or halt the experiments.Schwoebel p. 44; Thompson p. 73. On January 20, 1989, off Vieques Island Iowas Turret One fired six of the experimental shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed that one of the 16-inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16-inch shell ever fired. Moosally was pleased with the accomplishment, and ensured that news of the record was publicized in the media. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.Thompson, pp. 70‚Äì81. The Turret One gun crew leaders, which fired the experimental loads, considered defying the order because of the unauthorized nature and perceived danger of the experiment, but in the end fired their guns. In the 1950s, the US Navy had fired a nuclear-equipped 16-inch shell 13 nautical miles further than Skelley's shell. On April 10, 1989 the battleship was visited by the commander of the US 2nd Fleet, then Vice Admiral Jerome L. Johnson, and on April 13 sailed from Norfolk to participate in a fleet exercise in the Caribbean near Puerto Rico. The exercise, titled \\"FLEETEX 3-89\\", began on or around April 17 under Johnson's command. Iowa served as Johnson's flagship during the exercise.Schwoebel p. 1; Thompson p. 15. Thirty US Navy ships were participating in the exercise, including the aircraft carrier , seven cruisers, three guided-missile destroyers, two conventional destroyers, seven frigates, three amphibious assault craft, a communications ship, two oilers, a minesweeper, two ammunition ships, plus three South American frigates including one from Venezuela and another from Brazil. =Turret explosion= At 8:31 a.m. on April 19, 1989 Iowa prepared to engage in a main gun firing drill as Moosally and Johnson watched from the ship's bridge. Turret Two was to fire practice (no explosives) projectiles with five powder bags. The use of five bags had been directed by Skelley and was against regulations but Moosally was not aware of the unauthorized nature of the drill.Schwoebel pp. 1‚Äì2; Thompson pp. 15, 93‚Äì96. Turret One fired first, beginning at 09:33. Turret One's left gun misfired and its crew was unable to get the gun to discharge. Moosally now ordered Turret Two to load and fire a three-gun salvo. According to standard procedure, the misfire in Turret One should have been resolved first before proceeding with the exercise.Garzke, Dorsey, \\"Ten years after Iowa tragedy, only evidence left is memories\\"; Schwoebel pp. 2‚Äì4, 119, 232; Thompson pp. 98‚Äì100. Turret One was firing 2,700 lb dummy (BL&P;) shells with six powder bags filled with D845 propellant (reduced charge). Moosally's order to Turret Two also violated drill protocol. Lieutenant Leo Walsh, the ship's fire-control officer, was supposed to direct the loading and firing of the guns instead of the orders coming directly from the bridge. Turret One's left gun crew \\"super elevated\\" their gun eight times to try to coax the last powder bag to slide down against the primer in the breech, to no avail. Turret One's left gun remained in a \\"hang fire\\" condition until it was manually unloaded hours after the explosion in Turret Two. Turret Two's center gun explodes.At 09:53, about 81 seconds after Moosally's order to load and 20 seconds after the right gun had reported loaded and ready, Turret Two's center gun exploded. A fireball between and and traveling at per second with a pressure of 4000 lb per square inch (281 kg per square cm) blew out from the center gun's open breech. The fireball spread through all three gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret. All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed. The turret contained most of the force of the explosion.Schwoebel pp. 7‚Äì8, 136, 232, 238; Thompson pp. 97, 101‚Äì07, 152. Turret Two's sprinkler system failed to operate automatically. Firefighting crews quickly responded and sprayed the roof of the turret and the left and right gun barrels, which were still fully loaded with both gunpowder and projectiles, with water. On Kissinger's recommendation, Moosally ordered Turret Two's magazines, annular spaces, and powder flats flooded with 16 tons (14,000 kg) of seawater, preventing the remaining powder from exploding and likely saving the ship. The turret fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes.Schwoebel pp. 8‚Äì9; Thompson pp. 107‚Äì24. Meyer recommended to Kissinger that the powder rooms be flooded; Kissinger immediately forwarded the recommendation to Moosally. After the explosion, Moosally ordered the ship to General Quarters, which meant that all doors and hatches were closed, impeding efforts by firefighting teams to approach Turret Two to fight its fires. After the fire was extinguished, Moosally directed his crew to remove the bodies and to clean up the turret. No attempt was made to photograph or record the locations of the bodies or of damaged equipment in the turret. As a result, important evidence which could have assisted with the subsequent investigation into the cause of the explosion was lost.Schwoebel pp. 10‚Äì11, 65, 13, 121; Thompson pp. 88, 100‚Äì01, 109‚Äì10, 126‚Äì33, 142‚Äì43; Vistica p. 290. Vistica states that Rear Admiral Richard D. Milligan, the investigating officer, gave the order to clean up the turret without recording or collecting evidence. Moosally (left) greets President George H. W. Bush at the memorial ceremony at Norfolk on April 24, 1989.Iowa returned on April 23 to Norfolk, where a memorial service was held on April 24. Several thousand people, including family members of many of the victims, attended the ceremony at which President George H. W. Bush spoke. Moosally also spoke at the ceremony, saying, \\"I remember Turret 2. They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. We came together in times of trouble. We shared the good and the bad, the comedy and now the tragedy. But we must go on, the crew of the Iowa.\\"Schwoebel pp. 13‚Äì15; Thompson pp. 161‚Äì65. In a press conference after the ceremony, Moosally claimed that everyone in the turret was qualified for the position that they were filling. In reality, only 13 of the 47 turret crewmen were formally qualified (Schwoebel p. 233). =Investigation, deployment, and disciplinary action= Milligan was placed in charge of the investigation into the explosion. As part of his investigation, Milligan interviewed Moosally on May 1 and May 10, 1989. In his testimony to Milligan, Moosally criticized Iowas crew, stating that the Navy had sent him enlisted men of \\"inferior quality\\" and that many of Iowas sailors were \\"dopers, marginal performers, constant UAs [unauthorized absences]\\".Garzke, Schwoebel pp. 260‚Äì63; Thompson p. 181. Moosally added that if he had kicked out every sailor in his crew who was a troublemaker, had legal difficulties, or was incapable of doing his job, \\"I don't think I'd have many guys left.\\"Schwoebel pp. 260‚Äì63; Thompson p. 181. According to Thompson, Iowas Turret Two was trained forward after the explosion to its stowed position and superficial repairs were conducted. All the related repair pieces were stored inside the turret and the turret was sealed shut. The turret was never put back into operation.Thompson, p. 261. Iowa (top) with (left), (center), and (right) off the coast of Lebanon on August 16, 1989.In June 1989, Iowa, under Moosally's command, departed for a training cruise and operational deployment to Europe and the Mediterranean. On August 2, Iowa, in a shipyard at Marseilles, was ordered to join a force of US warships off the coast of Lebanon in response to threats by Shiite Muslim kidnappers to kill American hostages and threats to the US embassy by Maronite Christian demonstrators loyal to Michel Aoun. The ship remained off Lebanon until the crisis cooled a little over a week later, then departed for Italy.Schwoebel pp. 259‚Äì61; Thompson pp. 261‚Äì62, 276‚Äì79. Moosally missed the departure of Iowa from Marseilles because he and his wife were on leave in Paris. According to Thompson, Moosally had neglected to give Iowa the name and phone number of the hotel he was staying at and had not kept in touch with the ship. He was flown out to the ship by helicopter a day later (Thompson, p. 278). Milligan's investigation, completed in July, concluded that the explosion was caused intentionally by a Turret Two crewman named Clayton Hartwig who Milligan believed was suicidal and homicidal. Milligan also found that, under Moosally, Iowa was operating with severe training and safety deficiencies. The finding that the explosion was intentionally caused by Hartwig was heavily criticized by the victims' families, the media, and members of Congress. Most of Iowas crewmen also did not believe that Hartwig was responsible for the explosion.Schwoebel pp. xvii, 39‚Äì42, 70, 244; Thompson p. 284. Some of the key findings in the report included: Iowas crew failed to ensure Turret Two personnel were properly trained and qualified; ineffective enforcement of safety policy and procedures was the norm within Turret Two; unauthorized research and development experiments using the main guns was ongoing; preparation for the April 19, 1989 gunshoot was poorly conducted; Hartwig intentionally directed the center gun rammerman to overram the powder bags; and overraming the powder by 21-inches in and of itself would not have caused the explosion (Schwoebel pp. 243‚Äì44). On October 3, 1989 Donnell flew to the Mediterranean to discipline Iowas officers in response to findings in Milligan's report. Milligan had recommended that Moosally be relieved of command, but Donnell had decided on a lesser punishment. Moosally and Bob Finney, Iowas operations officer, were given non-punitive \\"letters of admonition\\" which were not placed in their permanent personnel records. Donnell stated that Moosally's \\"poor adherence to explosive safety regulations and ordnance safety\\" and \\"his failure of leadership\\" were a \\"marked departure from an otherwise outstanding performance\\".Thompson, pp. 286‚Äì87. Shortly thereafter, the Navy issued a statement explaining that the safety violations and training deficiencies found aboard Iowa during the investigation were unrelated to the explosion. Two weeks later, a panel of 13 Navy admirals recommended that Moosally be given another major command, stating that Moosally was \\"superbly fit\\" for such responsibility.Schwoebel pp. 44, 47; Thompson pp. 286‚Äì87, 316‚Äì17, 340‚Äì41. Milligan was one of the admirals on the panel who supported the recommendation. After Thompson asked Rear Admiral Brent Baker, the Navy's Chief of Naval Information, and Chief of Naval Personnel Jeremy Michael Boorda about the recommendation, Moosally's name, according to Thompson, was withdrawn.Thompson, pp. 286‚Äì87, 316‚Äì17, 340‚Äì41. On October 8, the Navy Times newspaper published a story titled \\"Iowa CO Rips Quality of Officers, Crew\\" which detailed Moosally's testimony to Milligan in which Moosally had disparaged his crew. Thompson claims that many of Iowas sailors were enraged by Moosally's remarks, with a few reportedly threatening Moosally's life.Thompson, pp. 316‚Äì17. Iowa returned to Norfolk on December 7. At a press conference the same day, according to Thompson, Moosally explained that his comments criticizing his crew had been taken out of context by the news media.Thompson, p. 349. =Senate testimony and retirement= Moosally was scheduled to testify on December 11 before the United States Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), which was investigating the Navy's findings about the explosion. The weekend before his appearance in front of the committee, Moosally prepared his remarks at his home in Oakton, Virginia. Rumors were spreading throughout the top ranks of the Navy that Moosally was angry about Milligan's investigation and was contemplating attacking the Navy's findings before the SASC. In response, several Navy admirals, including Bud Flanagan and Ted Gordon, at that time the Navy's Deputy Judge Advocate General, visited Moosally at his home during the weekend to encourage Moosally to support the Navy's position regarding the cause of the explosion in his senate testimony. Said Gordon of his visit, \\"I went over to Moosally's home the night before his testimony to tell him to cool it, to watch it. I told him I thought he would still make admiral, no matter what had happened to the Iowa.\\"Thompson, pp. 350‚Äì51. Appearing before the SASC on December 11, Moosally denied that Iowa had carried out illegal or unauthorized gunfire experiments. He added that his disparaging remarks about the quality of his crew had been misunderstood. Senator Sam Nunn asked Moosally if he agreed with the Navy's conclusion that Hartwig had \\"most probably\\" caused the explosion.Schwoebel pp. xviii, 27‚Äì28, 257‚Äì68; Thompson pp. 350‚Äì55. In a response that was widely reported in the media, Moosally answered, \\"I would not come out and say that. I would not make an unqualified statement that Petty Officer Hartwig is the guy who committed the wrongful act. I do not think I can do that.\\"Halloran; \\"2 Survivors of Iowa Blast Deny Shipmate Set It Off\\"; Schwoebel pp. xviii, 27‚Äì28, 257‚Äì68; Thompson pp. 350‚Äì55. Reportedly as a result of his refusal to fully support the Navy's position, Moosally's Navy career was over. A request for his retirement, whether made by Moosally or someone else is unclear, was approved a few days later. The Navy later reopened its investigation and eventually concluded that it could not determine who or what had caused the tragedy.Schwoebel pp. xix‚Äìxx, 223‚Äì24, 284‚Äì87; Thompson pp. 352, 372, 380‚Äì82. An independent review of the Navy's investigation by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.Garzke; Charles;Schwoebel pp. xxi, 164, 216‚Äì22. Legion of MeritCaptain Moosally retired from the Navy at that rank in May 1990. At his change of command ceremony on Iowa on May 4, 1990, Moosally criticized the Navy for mismanaging the investigation into the turret explosion, saying that the investigators were \\"people who, in their rush to manage the Iowa problem, forgot about doing the right thing for the Iowa crew\\". During the ceremony, Moosally was awarded the Legion of Merit by Rear Admiral George Gee for his service as commander of Iowa. Soon after, Moosally went to work for an unnamed defense contractor in the Washington, D.C. area.Gordon, \\"Navy Reopens Iowa Blast Inquiry After Ignition in Gunpowder Test\\", \\"Deadly Blast Haunts Battleship's Skipper\\", Thompson, pp. 367‚Äì68. On April 19, 1994, Moosally and other former Iowa crewmen attended the dedication of a memorial plaque at Norfolk Naval Station to the 47 sailors killed in the explosion. Moosally was shunned or ignored by many of the former crewmen present, who were still angry over his disparaging comments about them during the investigation.Dorsey, \\"Ten years after Iowa tragedy, only evidence left is memories\\", Thompson, pp. 396‚Äì97. A Glimpse of Hell In 1999, Charles Thompson published a book titled A Glimpse of Hell: The Explosion on the USS Iowa and Its Cover-Up which documented Thompson's investigation into the explosion and its aftermath. The book was extremely critical of Moosally, depicting him as an inept officer who gained command of the battleship through political connections.\\"Deadly Blast Haunts Battleship's Skipper\\", Thompson, \\"Cover-up aboard the USS Iowa\\", Blue, \\"Framed at Sea\\". In 2001, the FX TV network broadcast a movie A Glimpse of Hell based on Thompson's book, starring James Caan in the role of Moosally.\\"Deadly Blast Haunts Battleship's Skipper\\", ; =Lawsuit= In March 2001 Moosally and two other former Iowa officers plus an officer involved in the investigation into the explosion filed suit against Glimpse of Hell author Thompson, his publisher, W.W. Norton, and Dan Meyer, who the plaintiffs stated provided much of the information used in the book, for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. In response to the suit, Thompson stated that he stood \\"foursquare\\" behind his book's content.\\"Deadly Blast Haunts Battleship's Skipper\\", Supreme Court of South Carolina. \\"Published opinion and orders\\", Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\". The other plaintiffs with Moosally were John Morse, Bob Finney, and Joseph Dominick Miceli. Morse was Iowas former executive officer, Finney Iowas former operations officer, and Miceli led the Navy's technical investigation into the explosion. In April 2004 the South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer for of lack of personal jurisdiction against both individuals, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed.Moosally v. W. W. Norton Company, 594 S.E.2d 878. South Carolina Court of Appeals, 2004-04-05. In February 2007 the suit was settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, Moosally's attorney, said that his client felt \\"totally vindicated\\".Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\" W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending a letter to Moosally and the other plaintiffs stating, in part, \\"'To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family.\\"Associated Press, \\"Court allows Iowa officers to sue book publisher\\", Supreme Court of South Carolina. \\"Published opinion and orders\\", Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\" Lockheed Martin career =Littoral combat ship= In 1997, Moosally began working for Lockheed Martin in the Washington, D.C. area while living in Oakton. In 1999, Lockheed Martin appointed Moosally as president of its Naval Electronics & Surveillance Systems (NESS) Surface Systems business, based in Moorestown, New Jersey. On October 1, 2002, Lockheed Martin appointed Moosally as president of the NESS division.Lockheed Martin, \\"Appoints Fred P. Moosally\\". The division's name was later changed to Maritime Systems and Sensors (MS2) division.O'Rourke On May 29, 2004, Lockheed was awarded a contract to construct two of the first four littoral combat ships (LCS) for the US Navy. Moosally's MS2 division managed the contract for Lockheed. The contract called for the first LCS to be delivered to the Navy at the end of 2006 at cost of $220 million. As construction of the ship progressed, however, it became apparent that the delivery date and construction cost would significantly exceed the original expectations.Lockheed Martin, \\"First Littoral Combat Ship\\"; Merle. , Lockheed's first LCSIn response to an inquiry on adverse issues with the program, on February 8, 2007, Moosally submitted a statement to the United States House Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces regarding Lockheed's construction of its portion of the LCS contract. In the statement, Moosally stated that the problems with contract completion arose from the addition of new requirements and specifications by the Navy shortly after contract award, material shortages, and \\"First-of-Class issues associated with the process of transitioning a new ship design into production\\".Moosally, \\"Statement before the House Armed Services Committee\\". Due to the expected cost and schedule overruns with Lockheed's first LCS and a failure to come to an agreement on a fixed cost for future work, the Navy canceled Lockheed's production of its second LCS in April 2007. Lockheed's first LCS, , was delivered to the Navy in November 2008 at a cost of over $531 million, more than double the original contracted price. In March 2009, the Navy renewed the contract with Lockheed to build its second LCS, the .Washington Post, \\"National Briefing: Lockheed Gets Second Ship Deal\\". =Deepwater= Around 1997, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) determined that its fleet of open ocean (\\"deepwater\\") ships and aircraft needed to be replaced. The USCG elected to replace these assets with a system- of-systems acquisition which would be procured as a single, integrated package, estimated to cost a total of $24 billion, called the Integrated Deepwater System Program or \\"Deepwater.\\" On June 25, 2002, the USCG awarded a five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, performance-based contract to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS), a consortium of private companies led by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. Moosally served as vice-chairman of ICGS. On May 19, 2006, the USCG extended the contract with ICGS for 43 additional months.O'Rourke pp, 2‚Äì3Moosally, \\"Statement to the House Committee on Homeland Security\\", Defense Industry Daily Graphic of Deepwater components as originally envisioned by the USCGMoosally's MS2 division led Lockheed's participation in the Deepwater contract. Specifically, Lockheed's portion of the Deepwater program encompassed system engineering and integration, the command and control network, and logistics and aviation, including refurbishment of existing assets and production of new components. One of the refurbishment projects was upgrades to the USCG's 110-foot patrol boats. In August 2006, Lockheed engineer Michael DeKort went public with claims that Lockheed's MS2 division had contributed to ICGS's delivery of boats that were unsafe and which did not meet the USCG's requirements. DeKort stated that Lockheed had accepted schedule and cost requirements that were impossible to meet. As result, according to DeKort, Lockheed's MS2 engaged in corner-cutting measures which adversely affected the boat's electronics systems. These issues included camera surveillance blind spots over the bridge, electronic equipment for communications, navigation and sensor systems, that were installed on the outside of the boat, that would not meet extreme weather requirements, the use of hazardous smoke producing cables, and security deficiencies that would cause a compromise of the boat's secure communications systems.Lipton, \\"Billions later\\". A subsequent United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspector general report confirmed that some of DeKort's allegations were valid, including that in at least one instance, \\"The contractor [Lockheed Martin] knowingly installed in the (boats) equipment that did not meet specific environmental requirements outlined in the Deepwater contract.\\" As a result of this and other issues with the program, in April 2007 the USCG announced that it was curtailing ICGS's role as active manager of the Deepwater contract.Lipton, \\"Coast Guard to Manage Fleet Modernization\\". On May 17, 2007, Moosally testified before the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism concerning the DHS' report's findings. Moosally stated that Lockheed had either met the contracted requirements or had immediately notified the USCG when issues arose. He added that any other discrepancies were minor and did not affect the safety, reliability, or effectiveness of the systems in question.Moosally, \\"Statement to the House Committee on Homeland Security,\\". DeKort criticized Moosally's testimony, calling it \\"not correct\\" in that it had misrepresented the true nature of the issues. In a letter to Representatives Loretta Sanchez and Chris Carney, DeKort stated that in 2004 when he asked to talk to Moosally to explain his concerns about issues with MS2's work on the systems, Moosally had refused to meet with him.DeKort. The USCG later canceled all further work on upgrading the 110-foot patrol boats, but this was primarily because of problems with hull modernization and extension efforts by Bollinger Shipyards, Inc., a Lockheed subcontractor.Biesecker.

Universities and universities of applied sciences are not forced by law to make use of this propaedeutic diploma, but it is quite common. The diploma is not a recognized degree and thus grants no rights outside the Dutch educational system. It has remained in use after the introduction of the Bologna process and the international bachelor-master system in the Netherlands. When in use at an educational institution, the propaedeutic diploma is a mandatory diploma which a student acquires by successfully completing all subjects (60 credits) and study requirements of the first year. This first year is therefore also known as the propedeuse or the propedeutische fase (literally, \\"propaedeutical phase\\"). Some study programs require the student to score sufficient on an additional examination. = History = The propaedeutic diploma was introduced as a means to determine whether students were suited for studying in the direction of their choice. and traditionally signifies that a student is officially accepted at a university. To symbolize this, schools may choose to organize an annual formal event where the propaedeutic diploma is awarded, mostly in early October, although this tradition is on a decline for financial reasons. Educational reforms in 1982 emphasized the orientational, selecting and referring function. The difference between hogescholen(university of applied sciences) and universities was diminished so that the propedeutische fase became a commonly used name for the first year in all tertiary education. It became possible to enroll at university with a hogeschool propaedeutic diploma. This method is often used by students who did not obtain the required secondary education. University students can also enroll at a different university or hogeschool for the same or a similar study program. At the end of the first year, an educational institution is obligated to issue advice on a student's suitability, whether the institution awards the propaedeutic diploma or not. In the vast majority of cases, this will be positive advice. The two possible consequences of not obtaining the propaedeutic diploma in one year are a negatief advies (literally, negative advice) which implies that the university or hogeschool recommends the student to enroll in a different study program, and a bindend negatief advies (literally, \\"binding negative advice\\") which prohibits the student from continuing or re-enrolling for the same study program at the institution. Furthermore, most hogescholen (university of applied sciences) have included in their statutes that should a student fail to meet the requirements for the propaedeutic diploma within a set period of time, usually set at two years, the student cannot continue to obtain a bachelor's degree. = Analogies = In the UK, the Certificate of Higher Education is roughly equivalent to the propaedeutic diploma, being earned after the first year of the three-year course of study culminating in a baccalaureate degree. In the US, the equivalent of the propaedeutic diploma lies somewhere between an undergraduate certificate and an associate degree. Undergraduate certificates can be completed in as little as one semester (one- half of one academic year or about four months) and do not necessarily lead or contribute to any degree. Associate degrees (e.g. AA, AS) are typically earned after the first two years of the four- to five-year (in the US) course of study culminating in a baccalaureate degree; however, students matriculated in a bachelor's degree program are not usually awarded the associate degree en route (as is often the case when a doctoral student is awarded a master's degree en route). Additionally, there are first professional associate degrees (e.g. AAS, AGS) that do not necessarily lead or contribute to a bachelor's.

With teammates Jim Whittaker, Lute Jerstad, Willi Unsoeld and Tom Hornbein, he was a member of the first American team to summit Mount Everest on May 22, 1963. He worked for the National Geographic Society for most of his life, beginning as a picture editor in 1959 and serving as a photographer, writer, and scientist with the society until his retirement in 1994. He was killed in an automobile accident near Pocatello, Idaho later that year. Early life Barry Chapman Bishop was born on January 13, 1932 to Robert Wilson Bishop, a sociologist who was to become a dean at the University of Cincinnati, and Helen Rebecca Bishop. He was fascinated by climbing from an early age, spending his summers with the YMCA in Colorado and joining the Colorado Mountain Club at age nine or ten. Under the tutelage of the club's members, many of whom were also members of the 10th Mountain Division, Bishop quickly learned mountaineering skills and was guiding expeditions in the Rockies and Tetons by age 12. He attended school in Cincinnati; first a private school, and a private college preparatory school beginning in 8th grade. He began his undergraduate education at Dartmouth, where he roomed with Rodger Ewy and Bill Chafee. Following an acute lung infection, Barry soon switched to the University of Cincinnati, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Geology in 1954. While at Cincinnati, Barry was a member of Beta Theta Pi. As part of his undergraduate research, he did field work in the Mount McKinley area in the summer of 1951, during which time he participated in Bradford Washburn's expedition, reaching the summit on July 10, 1951 to claim the fourth ascent of the mountain and the first by the West Buttress route. He met Lila Mueller, also an undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati, and the two were married in 1955. In the summer of 1952, Barry and Rodger Ewy climbed guideless on many \\"classics\\" in Europe, among which the Zugspitze Ridge, Cime Grande in the Dolomites, Z'mutt Ridge on the Matterhorn, the traverse from Gornergrat to Monte Rosa via summits of Breithorn, Castor and Pollux and both summits of Monte Rosa, and the Dent du Requin Needle on Mont Blanc. Barry soloed the Italian Ridge on the Matterhorn. His studies continued at Northwestern University, where he earned a masters in geography in 1954-1955, studying shear moraines on the Greenland Icecap. During his work in Greenland he met Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and after joining the Air Force, served as scientific advisor to Byrd's staff with Admiral Dufek, at the Antarctic Projects Office in Washington, D.C., where he monitored international scientific programs in polar research. By 1958, when he was honorably discharged from the Air Force at age 27, Bishop had accumulated considerable skills as a mountaineer, polar scientist, photographer and explorer. His daughter Tara is now the wife of Greg Mortenson, the co-author of Three Cups of Tea. National Geographic Society In May, 1959, on the strength of his photographs from Antarctica and the Bugaboos, Bishop was hired by the National Geographic Society as Picture Editor for National Geographic. He rose quickly with the magazine, becoming a photographer for the magazine in 1960, and had his first published photography in 1962. His 1963 photography work on the American Everest Expedition earned him a National Press Photographers Association Special Award. Eventually he would become a vice president and Chairman of the Committee for Research and Exploration. Himalayan expeditions Bishop's work on shear moraines brought him to the attention of Sir Edmund Hillary, who invited him to join the 1960-1961 Himalayan Scientific and Mountaineering Expedition known as the Silver Hut expedition, where he served as the expedition's official glaciologist and climatologist. Though he was not sponsored by National Geographic on the trip, his photographic, scientific, and mountaineering accomplishments cemented his career with the Society. With fellow expedition members Mike Gill, Mike Ward and Wally Romanes, Bishop made the landmark first ascent of Ama Dablam, which was also the first winter ascent in the Himalayas. Barry's success with the Hillary expedition and his work with National Geographic led to an invitation to join the 1963 American Everest Expedition, which aimed to make the first American ascent of Mount Everest. He was transferred to the National Geographic editorial staff and wrote an account of the expedition for the magazine, accompanied by his photography. On nearing the mountain, the expedition decided to attempt the unclimbed West Ridge, and Bishop helped establish a route up to the summit pyramid at before transferring to the portion of the team attempting the South Col. Via that route, Jim Whittaker summitted on May 1, becoming the first American to do so. In the following weeks, Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld continued the attempt on the West Ridge, and Bishop and Lute Jerstad attempted the South Col. After a stove accident early on the morning of May 22, the pair began the summit attempt, reaching the South Summit at 2:00 p.m. and the main summit at 3:30. They waited on the summit for signs of Hornbein and Unsoeld, who were also due to reach the summit that day, but short of oxygen and seeing no sign of them, they began the descent at 4:15. As darkness fell around 7:30, they made voice contact with Hornbein and Unsoeld, who had summitted and were descending the South Col. Believing the other team had failed to summit, Bishop told his partner he thought the two of them were dead and God was calling them to heaven. After rendezvousing the four decided to bivouac but having no tents could only kneel on their packs to rest. During the night, temperatures reached ‚àí18 ¬∞F, and Bishop sustained frostbite that would result in the loss of all his toes and the tip of his little finger. On July 8, 1963, the team was awarded the Hubbard Medal by president John F. Kennedy for their achievement. Later career The loss of his toes marked the end of Bishop's technical climbing career, and in the late 1960s he refocused his energies on academics, enrolling in the University of Chicago's Ph.D. program in geography in 1966, assisting in high-altitude physiology studies, and planning and executing the field research for his dissertation, a cultural-ecological analysis of the Karnali Zone of western Nepal. The dissertation was eventually published in 1980 and in book form as Karnali Under Stress (1990). Through the 1980s and early 90s, Bishop continued both his administrative duties with the National Geographic society as Vice Chairman and then Chairman of the Committee for Research and Exploration and Chief of the Geographic Liaison Office, and his research and service, leading Himalayan research expeditions in 1983 and 1985 and continuing to write for National Geographic. He retired in 1994 and moved to Bozeman, Montana. On September 24, 1994, Bishop was on his way to deliver a lecture in San Francisco when he apparently veered onto the shoulder of the highway, lost control of his car, and was killed. He was survived by his wife Lila, who suffered minor injuries in the accident, and by his son Brent and daughter Tara. The National Geographic Society honored him posthumously with the Distinguished Geography Educator award in recognition of a life that \\"reflected National Geographic's mission of increasing and diffusing geographic knowledge.\\" See also *List of 20th-century summiters of Mount Everest References 1932 births 1994 deaths American mountain climbers National Geographic people University of Cincinnati alumni Northwestern University alumni Road incident deaths in Idaho American summiters of Mount Everest ","title":"Barry Bishop (mountaineer)"},{"id":"20608228","text":"Jannis Pieter Mazure (1966) Jannis Pieter Mazure (24 December 1899, Rotterdam ‚Äì 3 November 1990, The Hague) was a Dutch politician.biography from www.parlement.com He was a member of the Labour Party (PvdA) and was considered to be very outspoken about his beliefs.

The park comprises 586 hectares of remnant bushland in various locations throughout Warrandyte and Wonga Park around Pound Bend, Fourth Hill, Black Flat, Yarra Brae and various other locations in the area. It hosts many significant geographical, environmental, archaeological and historical sites, such as the site of the first gold discovery in Victoria in 1851 and preserves the sites of former gold mines and tunnels. It is a popular destination for school and community groups and is frequented by local bush walkers and hikers. Land now occupied by the park was initially occupied by Indigenous Australians of the Wurundjeri nation. After European settlement, gold was discovered in Warrandyte, and the area was mined for a number of years. Frequent clearing had at one stage removed all the vegetation in the area, and bushfires have erased much of the recent human architectural history of the area. However, they have ensured the health of the bushland and reduced the impact of human settlements, enabling the vegetation to recover throughout the 20th century. The major threats to the park's ecology are introduced species of flora and fauna such as foxes, rabbits, dogs and cats. Being located close to suburban settlements, backburning is regularly undertaken within the park to minimise risk of bushfires. History Land now occupied by the park was initially occupied by Indigenous Australians of the Wurundjeri nation. After European settlement in Melbourne, settlers were slow to spread out into the hills east of Melbourne into the Warrandyte area, but with the discovery of gold at Andersons Creek in July 1851, the first gold licences in Victoria were issued. At the turn of the century, the settlement at Warrandyte, employed about 250 miners.Parks Victoria, Official Website, 2008 Much of the area was mined heavily throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this was done in sections leaving large slots or \\"stopes\\" underground where the reef had been. Many of these mine shafts, structures and stopes remain as ruins throughout the park. The park itself was established in 1975 in an effort to protect areas geographic, environmental, historical and archeological significance around Warrandyte. Stane Brae and Yarra Brae, were later added because of their conservation value. The most recent addition to the park was the Mount Lofty area in 1997. Geography The cairn marking the site of the first recognised discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851 at Andersons Creek. The park is located around 175 km upstream of the mouth of the Yarra River in Warrandyte, 24 km east of Melbourne. The park in its entirety comprises several detached areas of land adjoining the Yarra River from Pound Bend in the west, through Warrandyte to Wonga Park through the Warrandyte Gorge to Mount Lofty in the east. Other areas of land are situated throughout the hills immediately south of Warrandyte. The various areas include (roughly from west to east); *Pound Bend - Includes the area around Pound Bend in the Yarra River, the westernmost section of the state park. *Norman Reserve - a small reserve where Pound Bend begins upstream. *Fourth Hill - one of the highest points in Warrandyte, intensively mined. *Whipstick Gully - a gully to the north of Fourth Hill, intensively mined. *Timber Reserve *The Common *Black Flat - an area of flat riverbank just south of Blue Tongue Bend near Jumping Creek. *Jumping Creek - the area where Jumping Creek flows into the Yarra River. *Yarra Brae - an area in the east of Warrandyte gorge on the southern banks of the river. *Mount Lofty - the easternmost section of the state park. Other smaller areas and reserves within the state park include: *Scotchman's Hill - another hill in central Warrandyte, northeast of Fourth Hill *The Island - an island/billabong in the river, heavily polluted by introduced species. *Koornong - an area of land to the east of Blue Tongue Bend. *Blue Tongue Bend - a bend in the river upstream from Jumping Creek. *Gravel Reserve - a small reserve on Jumping Creek *Stane Brae *Bend of Isles - area to the north of Mount Lofty around a series of bends in the river. =Gold Mine Ruins & Structures= A headframe at Whipstick Gully near the Victory Mine. The area around Fourth Hill and Whipstick Gully was the most intensively mined in the area, the Gold Heritage Walk is a trail that includes information boards and signage detailing the history of the goldfields in the area. Some of the ruins of former mines and structures include:Parks Victoria Gold Heritage Walk Map *Victory Mine - Previously known as Young Colonial and Warrandyte Claim, the Victory mine produced one of the richest recorded claims. It was worked from 1896 and produced 1,870oz in three years. The main shaft was sunk to 67m. The area includes the ruins of a steam-powered quartz crusher and a large quarry. *Open Mines - Originally dug by Europeans, these open mines were often reworked by Chinese prospectors who were more successful at working the mines than the Europeans who frequently missed discoveries. *Johnson's Mine - This mine involved a horizontal or \\"adit\\" tunnel 60m into the hill, following a small reef. Gold was not found and a second tunnel was dug 20m before the mine was abandoned. *Upper Monument Mine *Miner's Hut - built in the 1950s, all structures in these minefields built before 1939 were destroyed in the \\"Black Friday\\" bushfires of that year. *Monument Mine - This type of shaft was operated by two or three people, the two mines remaining were in operation until the 1960s, the last working mines in the Fourth Hill area. *Louis Michel Memorial - a cairn marking the spot where gold was first discovered in Victoria, erected in 1935. *Geraghty's Mine - One of the most extensive mines in the area, the main tunnel was constructed from June 1859 - February 1860 and runs for 130m. Various tunnels branch off the main tunnel and a tramway was built to transport quartz from within the mine. Ecology :See Also: Flora of Australia, Fauna of Australia The wildlife, so diverse on the fringe of such a big city, includes kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, platypus and koalas. Over 100 bird species have been recorded as well as many reptiles, frogs, fish and insects. Vegetation in the area was almost totally cleared during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the vegetation seen today has regrown since then. Smooth-barked Manna Gums and Silver Wattles line the Yarra River, while an assortment of Box Eucalypts and other Wattles cover the hills. Much of the hilly area is characterised by open, forested country, with an understorey of native grasses, creepers, orchids and other wildflowers. Recreation A range of activities can be undertaken within the park and on the Yarra River, many of these activities can be guided or involve tours. The following is a list of the various activities and information regarding them in the park: *Horse riding - Equestrian trails exist in the Fourth Hill, Whipstick Gully, Timber Reserve, The Common and Yarra Brae areas. Horses are only permitted on designated bridle trails only, and the trails are sometimes closed in bad weather. Maps of the trails are available here. *Canoeing / kayaking - Canoeing and kayaking are popular along the Yarra River through much of the area occupied by the state park from Wonga Park into Warrandyte. *Mountain biking - There are several trails throughout the park. However, riders are advised to stay on the designated trails as there are several mine shaft ruins off the trails, and mountain biking through bushland destroys understory vegetation. *Walking and Hiking *Abseiling & Rock Climbing - These are very occasionally run by guided groups in various sections of the park. Fossicking- needs to purchase a miner's right Access Controlled burning in the state park around Fourth Hill, 2008 *Fourth Hill - access to the fourth hill area can be made via various sealed and unsealed streets branching from Yarra Street. *Tunnel Street Regulations *No dogs, cats or firearms. *Fires to be lit only in fireplaces provided. *Horse riding only on designated tracks. *No digging for worms on the river bank. *Prospecting is permitted in the bed of Anderson's Creek with non-mechanical tools only. *It is also advised that visitors: *Keep to walking tracks, as many partly hidden mine shafts dot the hills. *Tracks in Whipstick Gully can be steep and slippery in wet weather.

Keltis is a board game designed by Reiner Knizia that won the Spiel des Jahres for best game of the year in 2008. In the US, it has been marketed as Lost Cities: The Board Game, though there are some subtle rules differences. It is a multi-player board game that is based on the same theme as Knizia's two-player card game Lost Cities. Players score points by playing cards, which must be played in ascending or descending order. Each turn, a card is played which advances the player's token along a stone path. Playing only 1 to 3 cards in a color results in negative points for that color. Each card played improves a player's score, and when at least 4 cards of one color have been played, positive points are scored for that path. Each player records progress using tokens. One token is taller, and points it collects are doubled. Extra points are gained by collecting stones or landing on bonus squares during the game. The game ends either when five of the players' tokens have entered the \\"goal area\\" consisting of the last three ranks on the board, or when the deck runs out.

The Rajarata University of Sri Lanka was established as the eleventh University in Sri Lanka and was opened on 31 January 1996 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Over the years, the University has developed to become a centre of excellence in higher education in the North Central Province as well as in Sri Lanka. The academic programs of the RUSL are offered by six faculties namely; Technology, Agriculture, Applied Sciences, Management Studies, Medicine and Allied Sciences and Social Sciences and Humanities. The main administrative complex, the Faculties of Applied Sciences, Technology, Management Studies and Social Sciences and Humanities are located at Mihintale while the Faculty of Agriculture and Faculty of Medicine Allied Sciences are located at Puliyankulama and Saliyapura, respectively.http://www.rjt.ac.lk/  History  Rajarata University was established as the eleventh National University in Sri Lanka and was opened on 31 January 1996 by President Chandrika Bandaranayake, in accordance with the Gazette Notification 896/2 and the University Act 16 of 1978. The official opening ceremony was attended by Prime MinisterSirimavo Bandaranayake, Hon. Speaker Kiri Banda Ratnayake, Minister of Higher Education Richard Pathirana, Deputy Minister of Higher Education Wiswa Warnapala, Governor NCP Maithripala Senanayake, Chairman UGC Prof. Stanley Thilakaratne, the University's first Vice Chancellor Prof. W.I. Siriweera and the University's first chancellor, Dr. Jayantha Kelegama. Having examined the Social variables encountered by Sri Lanka in the two decades 1970 and 1980, the then government decided to establish Affiliated University colleges to provide opportunities for higher education for youth who are qualified but deprived of University education. Consequently, Affiliated University colleges were established in Makandura, Kuliyapitiya and Anuradhapura. Subsequently, on 7 November 1995, the Affiliated Universities were amalgamated and the affiliated university of Kuliyapitiya and Makandura were named as Wayamba Campus of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka. At the inception, four faculties namely Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Faculty of Management Studies, Faculty of Agriculture and Faculty of Applied Sciences were established and in the year 2006, the Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences was established as the fifth faculty of RUSL. The faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities, Faculty of Management Studies and Faculty of Applied Sciences are located in the Mihintale premises while the Faculties of Agriculture and Medicine and Allied Sciences are situated in Puliyankulama and Saliyapura respectively. In November 1995 the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka (RUSL) was established by the Gazette Notification No: 896/2 of 7 November 1995 in the administrative District of Anuradhapura. The Central Province Affiliated University College (CPAUC) in Polgolla, located 140 km from the main campus at Mihinthale, Anuradhapura was amalgamated to the RUSL as its Faculty of Applied Sciences (FASc). The immediate task of the FASc was to upgrade all the students of the CPAUC who had successfully completed their diploma requirements, to the graduate level. On this task the FASc was inaugurated on 10 January 1997 to commence the third-year degree programme with a batch of 102 students, who graduated in 1998. The first batch of students who were directly sent by the UGC to follow the degree programme was enrolled in November 1997. After functioning for nearly 10 years at Polgolla, the faculty was established in the main campus at Mihinthale, on 16 January 2006 upon completion of Stage I of the building complex.  Faculties  The university consists of six faculties, Technology, Applied Sciences, Agriculture, Management Studies, Medicine and Allied Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities = Faculty of Agriculture (FA) = Faculty of Agriculture (FA) offers B.Sc. Agriculture(Special) four-year degree in Agriculture On the recommendation of the committee on affiliated University colleges (1994), nine Affiliated University colleges spread out in various provinces of the country were merged to form two National Universities, the Rajarata and the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka in 1996. The Affiliated University college of the North Western province which consisted of two academic sections namely; Home science and Nutrition and the Agriculture, originally affiliated with the University of Kelaniya and Peradeniya respectively, were merged to form the Wayamba Campus of the Rajarata University in terms of the provisions of the section 18 and 47(1) of the University act. No 16 of 1978 and campus board ordinance NO: 3 of 1995. Two faculties were set up to form the Wayamba Campus namely, the faculty of Agricultural Science and the faculty of Applied Sciences, each with three departments of study. The Faculty of Agricultural Sciences constituted the Department of plantation Management, Horticultural Sciences and Food Technology and Agricultural Engineering. A three-year general degree in Agricultural Science was offered. Later in 1999, a committee was appointed to make recommendations to upgrade the Wayamba Campus to a fully-fledged university. Based on the recommendations of this committee the Wayamba University was established in August 1999. With that faculty of Agricultural Sciences taken over to the Wayamba University in 1999 and Rajarata University loses its Agriculture Faculty. In the year 2001, a new Agriculture Faculty of the Rajarata University has incepted at Puliyankulama closes to ancient Anuradhapura and about ten kilometers away from Mihintale where administration building complex and other sister faculties were located.

Surfacing around the turn of the 21st century, it is widespread throughout the United States, with documented practice on the East and West Coasts and in the Midwest and South, largely in college and youth communities. Rules and play Playable by three (and to some extent two) or more players, the game involves the participants (if numerous, then seated in a circle) \\"passing\\" the word zip to the person on their right with their lips curled in over their teeth. The person to one's right must do the same, and so on. If any participant wishes to change the flow of the passage, he or she must say the word bong instead of zip, reverting the game's direction. The word bong performs one of two functions, depending on how the game is played. The first (and probably more common) function simply uses bong to switch the game's direction. The second has zip stand for a clockwise flow and bong stand for a counterclockwise flow, thus giving both the words zip and bong the power to revert the flow. In either case, use of the words can result in an effective restricting of the game between two players until one chooses not to revert the flow. The object of the zip and bong is to stay in play. This is accomplished by never showing one's teeth and by not missing one's turn (which is potentially difficult in small groups who make use of the word reversion). The game can be difficult because the absurdity of its play easily causes laughter, which can lead to exposure of the teeth.
