Protection and development of the sugar mill land has been controversial. It created a loss of billions rupees of taxpayer money. Illegal occupation of government lands impeded the development of the local area and caused the loss of significant agricultural jobs. The plan is to recover these encroached lands and reestablish the Birgunj Sugar Mill for farmers. Destruction of the natural forest and river by domestic and cross border gangs created flood and desertization of fertile lands. Electricity theft using unauthorized hooks disturbed electricity availability. Dumarbana has its own college, high schools and cooperatives. It has been developing as an educational, agricultural, socioeconomic hub in Bara district.

The engine was ground-tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and its use was incorporated in the Kurchatov Mars 1994 crewed mission proposal. This engine had slightly higher performance (exhaust temperature and specific impulse) over NERVA (the U.S. nuclear thermal rocket engine project). The design of the reactor core included thermal insulation between uranium carbide/tungsten carbide fuel and the zirconium hydride moderator. This solution allowed for a very compact reactor core design. Hydrogen flow cooled the moderator first allowing to keep very low neutron energy and high fission cross-section, then it was heated by the direct contact to the fuel rods. To prevent the chemical reaction between carbide and hydrogen, about 1 percent of heptane was added to the hydrogen after the moderator passage. The hydrogen boost turbopump was designed by KBKhA in Voronezh. TEM, an evolved design, is under development .

The Mongolian government takes the latter view.  1932 armed uprising  In April 1932 a group of lamas, angered by heavy-handed persecution of Buddhist monks and government expropriations of monasteries, ignited a revolt in Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province by occupying several town centers. The uprising soon spread to four provinces in the northwest of the country and lasted until October 1932, with outbreaks reported in the east of the country as well. By June the Mongolian Red Army had brutally suppressed large pockets of the revolt. The involvement of the Soviet Red Army in the suppression is still debated. Surprised by the breadth of the uprising, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin ordered that the implementation of socialism in Mongolia be temporarily scaled back. At the Third Congress of the MPRP (June 29‚Äì30, 1932), top leftist politicians were blamed for creating conditions that led to the revolt. A few days later, on July 2, 1932, Jigjidjav, who was known as the top-leftist personality in Mongolia, was stripped of all of his offices.Babaar 1999, p 320 Later in 1932 Jigjidjav was appointed minister of trade, road transport and communications development, a post he held until his death on May 22, 1933.

United States, 406 U.S. 441 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court decision that ruled on the issue of whether the government's grant of immunity from prosecution can compel a witness to testify over an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In a 5-2 decision (Justices Brennan and Rehnquist took no part in the consideration of the case), the Court held that the government can overcome a claim of Fifth Amendment privilege by granting a witness \\"use and derivative use\\" immunity in exchange for his testimony. Background Petitioners were subpoenaed to appear before a United States grand jury in the Central District of California on February 4, 1971. The Government believed that petitioners were likely to assert their Fifth Amendment right. Prior to the scheduled appearances, the government applied to the District Court for an order directing petitioners to answer questions and produce evidence before the grand jury under a grant of immunity conferred pursuant to . Petitioners opposed issuance of the order, contending primarily that the scope of the immunity provided by the statute was not coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination and so was not sufficient to supplant the privilege and compel their testimony. The District Court rejected ordered petitioners to appear before the grand jury and answer its questions, under the grant of immunity. Petitioners appeared but refused to answer questions, asserting their right against compulsory self-incrimination. They were brought before the District Court, and all persisted in refusing to answer the grand jury's questions, notwithstanding the grant of immunity. The court found both in contempt and committed them to the custody of the Attorney General until either they answered the grand jury's questions or the term of the grand jury expired. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.406 U.S. at 443. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the question of whether testimony may be compelled by granting immunity from the use of compelled testimony and evidence derived therefrom (\\"use and derivative use\\" immunity) or if it is necessary to grant immunity from prosecution for offenses to which compelled testimony relates (\\"transactional\\" immunity). Decision The United States can compel testimony from an unwilling witness who invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by conferring immunity, as provided by , from use of the compelled testimony and evidence derived therefrom in subsequent criminal proceedings, as such immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege and sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the right. Transactional immunity would afford broader protection than the Fifth Amendment privilege and is not constitutionally required. In a subsequent criminal prosecution, the prosecution has the burden of proving affirmatively that evidence proposed to be used is derived from a legitimate source, wholly independent of the compelled testimony.

History In 1912, two years after the Boy Scouts of America were founded in the United States, the Manchester Council (#330), a volunteer-led council was organized. Initially there were only two troops, both of them chartered by the YMCA. As Scouting grew in popularity, three more makeshift and unrecognized councils sprang up in Dover, Claremont, and Portsmouth. The council grew steadily and added a Scout Executive to its staff in 1919. On January 9, 1920, the Manchester Council was granted an official charter with the Boy Scouts of America. At that time, the council represented ten troops and 256 Scouts within Manchester, and 87 troops with a total of 1621 Scouts in New Hampshire. In 1925, the Manchester Council acquired Camp Manning in Gilmanton for use as a summer camp. While the Manchester Council grew rapidly, the rest of New Hampshire's Scouting program saw limited growth. On May 25, 1929, the Manchester Council was renamed the Daniel Webster Council (#330),and expanded to cover Scouting for the entire state. The new name was derived from New Hampshire statesman Daniel Webster. Organization The Daniel Webster Council is divided into eight geographical districts: * Abnaki District * Arrowhead District * Historic District * Massabesic District * Mt Monadnock District * Sunapee District * Wannalancit District * Nutfield District- dissolved as of 1/1/2019 - Towns split between Historic, Arrowhead, and Massabesic Districts * Exploring Division Camps =Griswold Scout Reservation= Griswold Scout Reservation is a Scouting reservation located near Gilmanton Iron Works, New Hampshire, United States. There are two summer camps located within it: Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell. Covering over of forest, lakes, and mountains, the Scout Reservation was first run by the Norumbega Council. In 1971, the Daniel Webster Council acquired what was then called the Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. In 2000, the camp acquired additional land, which it named Camp Bell, and the total reservation was renamed Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. Hidden Valley is run as a traditional Scout camp with full dining facilities and a wide variety of program areas and activities. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the Patrol Method. Campers do their own cooking in their sites, and participate in day-long activities as patrols. Camp Bell has a different variety of activities from Hidden Valley, including their \\"living history areas\\", and a different set of merit badges are available. The land currently used primarily by Camp Bell has been used as the homes of many other camps, most recently Camp Manning, which after being sold by the Daniel Webster Council to private owners, changed ownership several times and had previously existed as a camp run by various organization such as the YMCA who called it Camp Leo. Camp Bell was named for a member of the council's executive board who was instrumental in reacquiring the property for the council. =Camp Carpenter= Camp Carpenter is the Cub Scout Summer camp located in Manchester, New Hampshire. It has a dining hall, a swimming lake and ample tent space. It is also home to the Lawrence L.

Passaconaway Lodge The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Passaconaway Lodge #220. On June 10, 1942, the Passaconaway Lodge was organized at Camp Manning. 43 members were inducted that year. The totem of the lodge was chosen as the bear since the Native word Passaconaway means \\"the child of the bear\\". Election of the first lodge officers took place. The mission of this lodge is to fulfill the purpose of the Order of the Arrow as an integral part of the Boy Scouts of America through positive youth leadership under the guidance of selected, capable adults.

It is exclusively used by regional services. However it also acts as a diversionary line in case of difficulties on the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim railway. History The Mangfall Valley Railway was part of the first rail link between Munich and Rosenheim (and beyond that to Salzburg/Kufstein), the so-called Maximiliansbahn. It was built by the state of Bavaria and completed on 31 October 1857. At that time the route ended in the Rosenheim suburb of Am Ro√üacker. Not until 13 November 1858 was the first \\"real\\" station opened in Rosenheim complete with locomotive shed and turntable. That locomotive shed still exists today and is used as an exhibition building (e.g. the Bajuwaren- and Der Inn exhibitions). The railway was mainly used at that time to transport coal from the mine at Hausham to the Salinensudhaus salt works in Rosenheim. From Bad Aibling there was an electrified branch line to Bad Feilnbach, now dismantled. There was also a short stub line to Vagen, that was still used in the 1940s for passenger traffic. Later the tracks were only used to access the Leitzach factory, before it was knocked down in the early 1990s. The planned double-tracked expansion of the route has not been realised to this day, because in 1871 the newly built direct route from Munich to Rosenheim via Grafing (today the KBS means Kursbuchstrecke or timetable route and refers to the route number in the DB's official timetable/) took over the role of the main line. In 1971 the line was electrified in order to provide a relief line for the heavily trafficked KBS 950 route. The turnouts in the stations are unusually long in order to fulfil this function. Several new stations, at Feldolling, Hinrichssegen, Bad Aibling and Rosenheim, were to have been built some years ago; planning for them began in 1995. But even in 2006 the Deutsche Bahn stated that it could not give a firm date for the actual in-service date of the new stations. Local politicians have made strong complaints against Deutsche Bahn. Accidents and incidents On the route between Bad Aibling and Kolbermoor on May 28, 1945 military train full of soldiers collided head on with an empty train. The accident, which occurred in a forest, took five lives and caused 21 injured, some seriously. Contributory cause was the interruption of telephone and communication lines between Bad Aibling and Kolbermoor at the end of World War II. On 9 February 2016 the Bad Aibling rail accident occurred only 700m from the location of the 1945 accident when two passenger trains were involved in a head-on collision near Bad Aibling. Several people were killed and many more were injured. Route The departure point for the route is at Holzkirchen on the KBS 955/956/957 (Munich‚ÄìHolzkirchen‚ÄìBayrischzell/Lenggries/Tegernsee), where line 3 (KBS 999.3) of the Munich S-Bahn also ends. Kreuzstra√üe station is also an S-Bahn terminus, in this case for route 7 (KBS 999.7). At Rosenheim the line meets the KBS 950 and 951 main lines as well as the less important, unelectrified and single-tracked main line to M√ºhldorf (KBS 944). The entire route was worked until recently by locomotive-hauled push-pull trains, but more recently by electric multiple-units of DBAG Class 425. A higher train frequency is planned, as is the introduction of more stations (see table).

Hanniffy made his first appearance for the team during the 1997 National League and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the 2008 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal and one National Hurling League (Division 2) medal. Hanniffy was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Hanniffy is a four-time All-Ireland medalist with Birr. In addition to this he has also won six Leinster medals and eleven county club championship medals. Hanniffy's father, Declan and his brothers, Darren and Rory, also played hurling with Offaly. Playing career =Club= Hanniffy plays his club hurling with Birr and has enjoyed much success during a lengthy career. He was still a minor when he joined the club's senior team in 1994. That year he was a non-playing substitute when Birr made a clean-sweep of county, Leinster and All-Ireland titles. By 1997 Hanniffy was a regular member of the starting fifteen. That year he won his first county championship medal following a 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì4 defeat of Seir Kieran. He later added a Leinster medal to his collection following an 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì5 defeat of Castletown. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Birr take on Sarsfield's of Galway. Darren Hanniffy scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes and gave Birr a lead that they would never surrender. A 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Hanniffy his first All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their titles the following year, Birr bounced back in 1999. A 3‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì11 defeat of St. Rynagh's gave Hanniffy a second championship medal. A subsequent 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì11 defeat of Castletown gave Hanniffy a second Leinster medal. Hanniffy won further championship medals in 2000 and 2001 as Birr retained their status as the kingpins of Offaly hurling. Once again Birr defeated Castletown in the provincial decider to give Hanniffy his third Leinster medal. Once again Birr qualified for the All-Ireland final with Clarinbridge providing the opposition. A Declan Pilkington goal inside sixty seconds was the perfect start, although the Westerners did recover to lead by 1‚Äì4 to 1 -2 at the break. With wind advantage, Birr took control and secured a 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 victory. It was Hanniffy's second All-Ireland medal. Birr continued their dominance in 2002 with Hanniffy winning a fifth championship medal following a 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Kilcormac-Killoughey. He later added a fourth Leinster medal to his collection following a 2‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of Young Irelands in deplorable conditions. Birr later faced Dunloy in the All-Ireland decider. At the third time of asking Birr finally retained the title with a 1‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì11 victory. It was Hanniffy's third All-Ireland medal. In 2003 Birr defeated Ballyskenach by 1‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì11 to secure their fifth successive county championship. It was Hanniffy's sixth championship medal. A record six-in-a- row proved beyond Birr, however, Hanniffy won his seventh championship medal in 2005 as his side beat Coolderry by 0‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì5. It was the start of another great run of success for Birr as the club retained their titles in 2006 and 2007. Later that year Hanniffy won his fifth and final Leinster medal as Birr narrowly defeated Ballyboden St. Enda's by 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì13. Birr later had the chance to make history by becoming the first club side to win five All-Ireland titles, however, Portumna easily defeated Hanniffy's side by 3‚Äì19 to 3‚Äì9 in the decider. In 2008 Hanniffy won a remarkable tenth championship medal as Birr defeated Kinnitty by 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì15. It was a fourth successive county title for Birr. =Inter-county= Hanniffy made his senior debut for Offaly in a National Hurling League game against Tipperary in 1997. Later that year he came on as a substitute against Laois to make his championship debut. By 1998 Hanniffy was a regular impact sub for Offaly's championship campaign. He lined out in his first provincial decider that year, however, Kilkenny defeated Offaly by 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì11. This defeat prompted the Offaly manager, Babs Keating, to describe the team as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed, however, the replay was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Hanniffy's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest-ever Offaly performances, scoring 1‚Äì6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì13. It was Hanniffy's first All- Ireland medal. Offaly surrendered their All-Ireland crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats\\". Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14. The following few seasons proved difficult as Kilkenny went on to dominated the provincial championship. In 2005 Hanniffy won a Division 2 medal in the National League following a 6‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì7 trouncing of Carlow. Following Offaly's relegation from Division 1 of the National League in 2008, Hanniffy decided to call time on his inter-county career.

They were produced by a group of amateur animators known as Daicon Film, who would later go on to form the animation studio Gainax. The films are known for their unusually high production values for amateur works and for including numerous references to otaku culture, as well as its unauthorized appropriations of both the Playboy Bunny costume and the 1981 song \\"Twilight\\" by the English rock band ELO. Daicon III was made by Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai and Daicon IV credits twelve people, including Yamaga as the director and Anno and Akai as animation supervisors. Despite the questionable legal status of the works, the production of Daicon III resulted in debts that were repaid by selling video tapes and 8mm reels of the production, the profits of which went to the production of Daicon IV. In 2001, the anime magazine Animage ranked the Daicon animations as the 35th of the \\"Top 100\\" anime of all time. Summary =Daicon III Opening Animation= The Jet VTOL ship from Ultraman's Science Patrol descends out of the sky toward Earth, as a school girl, carrying her randoseru, observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to \\"DAICON\\". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as Punk Dragon blocks her path. He summons a mecha from Starship Troopers, and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and Gomora rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning Godzilla with the Ideon symbol. With King Ghidorah and Gamera chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A Star Destroyer, a TIE fighter, and Martian fighting machines from the film The War of the Worlds (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a lightsaber. After slicing an Alien Baltan in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from the Godzilla series catches fire. The Atragon breaks in two as the Yamato, the USS Enterprise, an X-wing fighter and Daimajin explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled daikon buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship Daicon. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, Toshio Okada and Yasuhiro Takeda, sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, Daicon departs for the far reaches of the universe. =Daicon IV Opening Animation= The Daicon IV Opening Animation begins with an abridged, 90-second retelling of the Daicon III Opening Animation set to \\"Noah's Ark\\" by Kitar≈ç from the album, Silver Cloud. After this, \\"Prologue\\" by Electric Light Orchestra is heard, while the lyrics appear against a starfield and an outline of the spaceship Daicon passes in the background. The film proper begins as \\"Prologue\\" segues into \\"Twilight\\", the song which follows it on the album Time. The girl from the previous animation is now an adult, wearing a bunny costume. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters and mobile suits then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside. She is then in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, with Stormtroopers sitting in the background and the Death Star enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a xenomorph with artificial legs, wielding the Discovery One, knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the Dynaman robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The Stormbringer suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as Yoda as Y≈´ Ida given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience. The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the Yamato, the Arcadia attached to the transformed SDF-1 Macross appear, along with an exploding VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter from Macross armed with a Gundam-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an otaku coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes. A host of machines and characters (from The Lord of the Rings, Conan, Narnia, Pern, and others) fly past her into space, including a Klingon battle cruiser, the moon ship from H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon, the Millennium Falcon, Lord Jaxom and the Thunderbirds. Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly through the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown. Then, suddenly, \\"what could only be described as an atomic bomb\\"\\"Daicon IV Opening Animation\\" , Little Boy 2005 ed. Takashi Murakami explodes over an unpopulated city, leaving behind a flurry of sakura petals. Successive upheavals of the Earth give birth to new worlds. As a beam launched by the Daicon traverses the sky, lush greenery sprouts and grows. The camera then pans over a massive crowd of fictional characters, the sun rises, the camera zooms out to the solar system, and the film ends with an image of the Daicon logo. Production Originally, the productions were intended to be shot in 16 mm film, but both were shot in 8 mm film instead and were completed only the morning before their debut. In order to pay off the debts of the productions, video copies of the animation were sold. Eng declares this as the first example of original video animation (OVA) predating Dallos. Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue originally designed the mecha that appears in the Daicon III clip chasing the little girl for a Japanese edition of the military science fiction novel Starship Troopers novel in the early eighties.Gundam Century (1st Edition), p.146. Minori Shobo. September 22, 1981. =Daicon III= Only three people were involved in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who was a part of the group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production. The work was carried out in an empty room of Okada's house where their business was also operated. While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera on a tripod and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets. Osamu Tezuka did not see the opening film at Daicon III, but was shown the film by Akai and Yamaga later that night. After watching the film, Tezuka remarked \\"Well, there certainly were a lot of characters in the film. ... [T]here were also some that weren't in the film\\". Akai and Yamaga later realized the omission of Tezuka's characters; they were subsequently used in the Daicon IV animation. According to Toshio Okada, the theme of water in the opening represented \\"opportunity\\" and Lawrence Eng, an otaku researcher, describes the theme as, \\"... making the best use of one's opportunities while fighting against those who would seek to steal such opportunity away.\\" =Daicon IV= The production facility for Daicon IV was in a dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union. Takeda defined it as a literal anime sweatshop, the building was shut down at 9:00 pm and a majority of the staff would be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning. The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors. Toru Saegusa did the artwork and the animations were done with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mahiro Maeda, Norifumi Kiyozumi; additional animation was provided by Ichiro Itano, Toshihiro Hirano, Narumi Kakinouchi, Sadami Morikawa, Kazutaka Miyatake. Originally, Daicon IV was supposed to be fifteen minutes long, but the difficult production resulted in the cut time. Reception and release The Daicon III film was reported on in Animec magazine which resulted in requests for the film to be released publicly. In order to pay off the debts from producing the film, the decision was made to sell 8mm reels of the film and videos. Additional original artwork and the storyboards were included in the release. The sale paid the debts and the profit would be used to produce Daicon IV. Due to copyright problems an official release of the animations has proven impossible. For the American release of the film, the rights to use of the Playboy bunny costume was denied and the rights to Electric Light Orchestra's music was consequently not sought. However, a laserdisc featuring Daicon III & IV Opening Animation was unofficially released in Japan as bonus material to a ¬•16,000 art book of the animations. This laserdisc is considered rare and highly valuable among collectors, easily fetching prices over a thousand dollars on online auctions. Legacy Since its release the animations have been referenced several times in Japanese media productions, especially those focused on otaku culture. Clips and characters from the animations appear in the 1991 Gainax OVA Otaku no Video. The opening sequence of the Train Man Japanese TV drama series from 2005 was inspired by and uses the Electric Light Orchestra theme and the lead character from the Daicon IV film. In episode 5 of Gainax's FLCL, titled \\"Brittle Bullet\\", Haruko, wearing a red bunny suit, flies in on a bass guitar and yells \\"Daicon V!\\" before attacking a giant robot with a slingshot. From 2008 to 2016, Otakon's AMV contest opened with a video inspired by and using clips from the Daicon IV film. At Fanimecon, Yamaga said, \\"[The openings are] a source of pride and something you want to strangle.\\" Akai, who wants to produce better films, stated, \\"I don't want to see them for a long time. Just thinking about them sends shivers down my spine.\\" Lawrence Eng stated that without the Daicon animations, Gainax might never have existed. In 2001, the anime magazine Animage ranked the Daicon animations as the 35th of the \\"Top 100\\" anime of all time. =Daicon 33= Gainax revealed the details of a new campaign to celebrate Daicon Film's 33rd anniversary. The new project is named \\"DAICON FILM 33\\" and was announced on January 8, 2014. The basis of the project is a \\"revival of DAICON FILM\\" and includes the release of several goods inspired by the original films from the eighties. The project's official site has started accepting pre-orders for the first lineup of memorial goods. A new illustration of the \\"Daicon Bunny Girl\\" has been drawn by Takami Akai, the original character designer of the opening animation films and one of the founders of Gainax. The art was displayed on the top page of Gainax's official site. No further news about the project has been announced since.

Family and education Phillipps was born in Beckenham, Kent, the son of Henry Mitchell Phillipps. In 1883, he went to Charterhouse School Who was Who, OUP 2007 and in 1886 he travelled to Heidelberg in southern Germany to study for three years, returning as a fluent speaker of the German language.Roy Douglas, Vivian Phillipps in Brack et al., Dictionary of Liberal Biography; Politico‚Äôs, 1998 p295 In 1890, Phillipps went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, obtaining his bachelor's degree in Modern Languages tripos in 1893. In 1899, he married Edinburgh woman Agnes Ford, and they couple had a son and two daughters. Career Phillipps‚Äô first employment was as a teacher of German at Fettes College in Edinburgh.Douglas, op cit, p295 While there he wrote a text-book, A Short Sketch of German Literature for Schools, published in 1895. He left Fettes in 1905,The Times, 18 January 1955 deciding to opt for a career in the law. In 1907 he was called to the Bar at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn and practised as a member of the Northern Circuit. From 1915 he served as a Justice of the Peace in Kent and became Vice-Chairman of the Bench in 1931.Douglas, op cit p297 He was Chairman of the West Kent Quarter Sessions between 1933 and 1945. Politics =Parliamentary candidate= Phillipps A convinced Liberal, Phillipps first tried to enter Parliament at Blackpool in 1906 and then at Maidstone in both the January and December 1910 general elections.Philip Williamson, Henry Vivian Phillipps in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; OUP 2004-08 In 1918 he was the Liberal candidate at Rochdale but as a supporter of H H Asquith he was not a recipient of the Lloyd George Coalition Government coupon which went instead to his Conservative opponent Alfred Law, who won with a healthy majority of 7,847 votes. =Political secretary= Between 1912 and 1916, Phillipps was appointed to be private secretary to Thomas McKinnon Wood, the Scottish Secretary.The Times, 13 June 1912 He continued briefly in that post under Wood‚Äôs successor Harold Tennant. Tennant was the brother of Margot Asquith (n√©e Tennant), the wife of the prime minister. When Asquith was replaced as prime minister by Lloyd George in December 1916, he asked Phillipps to become his private secretary, a post he held between 1917 and 1922. He gained a reputation at this time as being the most implacable opponent of Lloyd George of the circle around Asquith. =Member of Parliament= Phillipps finally managed to enter the House of Commons at the 1922 general election for the constituency of Edinburgh West. In a straight fight with the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament John Gordon Jameson, Phillipps won the seat, albeit by the narrow margin of 666 votes. He held the seat at the 1923 general election this time in a three-cornered contest with Tory and Labour opponents, increasing his majority to 2,232, when some commentators had forecast he would lose.The Times, 8 December 1923 =Liberal Whip= After the 1922 general election, there were a number of attempts to bring about the reunion of the Asquith and Lloyd George factions within the Liberal Party.Chris Cook, The Age of Alignment: Electoral Politics in Britain 1922-1929; Macmillan, 1975 p.89) Asquith was by now back in the House of Commons having won a by-election at Paisley in 1920 but he and Lloyd George were initially cool on the possibility of reunion David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p90 The problem of reunion spilled over into internal party appointments. In 1919, Asquith had selected George Rennie Thorne, the MP for Wolverhampton East as his Chief Whip. Asquith was not in Parliament at this time and the remaining independent Liberals wanted James Myles Hogge as Whip, so Asquith appointed him to be Thorne‚Äôs colleague.The Times, 13 February 1923 Thorne resigned in 1923 and Asquith took the opportunity to replace Hogge as well, immediately appointing Phillipps to the post of Chief Whip, even though as a newly elected MP he was inexperienced in Parliamentary terms. Moreover, Phillipps was known to be totally committed to his old chief and was perhaps not the right choice to lead the negotiations between the rival wings of the party as they struggled to come to an accommodation and towards an eventual reunion. Or perhaps he was exactly what Asquith and the official party wanted. One historian comments that the appointment of Phillipps underlined the reluctance of the official Liberals to renew their connection with the former prime minister David Powell, British Politics 1910-1935: The Crisis of the Party System; Routledge, 2004 p122-123 while another suggests that Asquith sacked Hogge and deliberately appointed Phillipps in order to thwart reunion at that time.Cook, op cit pp 89-90 & 96 The 1923 general election helped the situation, as it was called on the issue of protectionism and tariff reform by prime minister Stanley Baldwin and Liberals of all shades were able to come together in support of the traditional policy of free trade. However, there were other issues to be resolved before formal reunion could be achieved, notably the question of access for the former independent Liberals to monies in the Lloyd George fund, the sizeable treasure chest which he had amassed over the years including by the sale of honours during his time in 10 Downing Street.G R Searle, The Liberal Party: Triumph and Disintegration, 1886-1929; Palgrave, 2001 p146 Further difficulties emerged with the formation of the first Labour government in January 1924. The Liberals, who held the Balance of power in the House of Commons agreed to allow Labour to take office, causing further disagreements within the party. Phillipps, as Chief Whip, had to issue a statement at one point officially denying a split between Asquith and Lloyd George on the question of turning out the Baldwin government.The Times, 19 April 1924 On occasions the party‚Äôs MPs were split in Parliamentary votes The Times, 8 April 1924 and it was a disastrous miscalculation on a Liberal amendment to a Conservative censure motion on the Campbell case which actually led to the downfall of the government against Liberal wishes.Roy Douglas, History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson ,1971 pp 179-180 Phillipps presided over all this as Chief Whip. =1924 General Election= Like so many other Liberal MPs, Phillipps was unable to overcome the swing to the right which occurred at the 1924 general election. The electorate was coming to see the political system as a left-right battle between the principal challengers on those wings of British politics, Labour and Conservative. There was little room for the Liberals in a system which discriminated against third parties and in a tight three-way contest in Edinburgh West Phillipps lost his seat to the Conservatives.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Elections Results, 1918-1949, Political Reference Publications, 1969, p. 584 Overall the Liberal Party's Parliamentary strength was reduced to 40 seats. Phillipps stood again in Edinburgh West at the 1929 general election but found himself out of step again with Lloyd George over the issue of reducing unemployment by state intervention. The impression given to the electorate was of a still divided Liberal Party. It was again a reasonably close three-cornered contest but Phillipps came third and he decided not to try for re-election Parliament again. Other political and public appointments Phillipps served as Chairman of the Liberal Party Organisation from 1925‚Äì27 and was one of the secretaries to the Liberal Council These appointments proved difficult for Phillipps because Asquith was out of the House of Commons again after losing Paisley in 1924 and agreed to go to the House of Lords in 1925, playing a diminishing role in the party, eventually resigning as leader in 1926.The Times, 15 October 1926 Lloyd George assumed the leadership. Questions of money and organisation proved onerous.The Times, 27 November 1925 Phillipps chaired a fund raising initiative called the ‚ÄòMillion Fighting Fund‚Äô The Times, 3 February 1925 but the appeal was a disaster and he was forced to resign from the party‚Äôs Administrative Committee.Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914-1935; Cornell University Press, 1966 p339 The Liberal Council was set up by Phillipps and a number of other distinguished Liberals with the object of rallying those party members who opposed Lloyd George and his money and to supply sympathetic constituency associations with speakers, literature and candidates.Wilson op cit, pp339-340 Phillipps never overcame his distrust of Lloyd George and his enmity towards him. When Conservative newspapers began trying to uncover damaging information about the Lloyd George Fund and the sale of honours Phillipps was one of their prime sources. Less controversially perhaps, Phillipps was a member of the West Kent Unemployment Appeal Tribunal, 1934‚Äì40 and the Kent Agricultural Wages Committee, 1935‚Äì40. He also served on the Board of Visitors at Maidstone Convict Prison. Autobiography In 1943 Phillipps published his autobiography My Days and Ways; published by Pillans & Wilson of Edinburgh and printed \\"for private circulation\\".British Library catalogue; system number 002901786 Douglas has described it as a \\"useful record to how matters looked to a devoted Asquithian\\".Douglas, in Dictionary of Liberal Biography; p297 Death Phillipps died at his home at Upper Kennards, Leigh, Kent near Tonbridge in Kent on 16 January 1955 aged 84.

He lived in Iowa for several years before moving to Nashville to work as a farmer and salesman. Hale first gained regional fame as a banjo player in the early 1900s, and taught the instrument to Chattanooga banjoist Homer Davenport. He joined the Grand Ole Opry (then called the WSM Barn Dance) in 1926. While he played both banjo and fiddle throughout his career, he only made recordings as a fiddle player. Hale's group \\"Theron Hale and Daughters\\"-- which consisted of Hale on fiddle, Hale's daughter Elizabeth on piano, and daughter Mamie Ruth on either second fiddle or mandolin-- recorded several tracks in 1928 and played regularly throughout the 1930s. The group dissolved after Mamie Ruth left in the late 1930s, although Theron continued playing informally throughout the following decade. Around 1948, Hale paired up with Opry guitarist Sam McGee to make several recordings for the Tennessee State Extension Project, which was promoting traditional square dancing music.Wolfe, \\"Notes,\\" 11. Unlike most Opry acts of the day, Hale preferred slow, traditional \\"twin fiddle\\" sets rather than dance music.

Brown (born 1909) was a quarterback for the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 1929 to 1931, while playing for coach Dana X. Bible. Brown lettered in 1930 and 1931, and started at quarterback in 1931. That season, he led the Cornhuskers to an 8-2 record, and an undefeated Big Six record and conference title. A native of Wisner, Nebraska, Brown wore jersey #17 throughout his Cornhusker career, and was the first of three Wisner High School graduates to star at Nebraska in the 1930s. His cousin, Jerry LaNoue, would follow Brown to Nebraska, where he would earn All Big Six honors at quarterback; in turn, it was LaNoue who encouraged fellow Wisner native Warren Alfson to become a Cornhusker football player. Alfson ultimately earned All-America recognition as a guard in 1940. Like Alfson and LaNoue, Brown worked for some time in order to save enough money to attend Nebraska. Brown had never played an organized game of football until joining the Cornhuskers, as Wisner High did not field a football team while he attended the school. Wisner briefly fielded a team following Brown's graduation, but they failed to achieve a winning season. Despite Brown's field success, Wisner High School soon dropped football again after his Cornhusker career was finished. However, Brown achieved significant success as a Wisner High basketball player--in fact, he was a starter on the Bulldogs' 1923 state champion team as an eighth grade student, despite not being old enough to legally play. So, he was the only Wisner student to letter five times in a varsity sport.'A Great Past, A Greater Future--A History of Wisner, Nebraska. Wisner News-Chronicle; 1971.

Definitions Trust management can be conceptualized in two ways, the process by which an individual becomes trustworthy and second, the process of assessing the reliability of other individuals. Both concepts of trust are considered as equally significant in the context of trust management. Becoming trustworthy on a personal level is a significant criterion of success and survival as it allows cooperation and collaboration between the individual and other people. Thus it is an important principle as it common for a majority of people attempt to build up a \\"fake image\\" of their reliability for personal benefits. Having the ability to assess the reliability of other individuals is equally as important as being trustworthy oneself. Through being able to detect reliability, one can make better decisions and employ trust in the right people. Taking these two aspects together, the following definition of trust management can be formulated: (Grudzewski, Hejduk, Sankowska, Wa≈Ñtuchowicz, 2008) ‚ÄúThe activities of creating systems and methods that allow relying parties to: :1. Make assessments and decisions regarding the dependability of potential transactions involving risk :2. Allow players and system owners to increase and correctly represent the reliability of themselves and their systems.‚Äù Trust is a container concept used in a broad variety of disciplines. Much work has been done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political sciences, philosophy, anthropology and management sciences. Simply defining \\"trust\\" is a milestone in the management sciences. One can barely speak of coherent research in the field of trust and trust management. For trust management defined above, there are some crucial assumptions as follows: :1. Some suspicion is often well-founded in competitive organizations; as in the course of unforeseeable political circumstances, the cost of misplaced trust can have a disastrous effect, :2. In a potentially uncertain, dangerous and risky environment people need to know very well who can be trusted and under what circumstances. Moreover, it is essential to see the necessity of being aware of potential dangers. The essence of trust management is not only to trust but to decide to what extent to trust-- and how to create and develop trusting relationships. When there is a trust deficit a climate of resignation ensues. It brings on consternation and makes it hard to concentrate on agreed targets. People tend naturally to limit these effects and create \\"trust substitutes to counteract the climate of uncertainty generated by these effects\\".(Sztompka, 1998, 2007) These equivalents of trust are as follows: :1. Providentialism ‚Äì meaning supernatural forces, fortune, God or metaphysical forces. :2. Corruption ‚Äì predicting and having control under the other‚Äôs people's actions using bribes, favors, favoritism and so on. :3. Pressure ‚Äì directly and unconditionally controlling the other‚Äôs people's actions. :4. Isolation (ghettoization) ‚Äì separating certain ethnical, religion or professional groups in unfavorable and threatening its environment, with strong internal loyalty strengthened by Xenophobia and lack of tolerance for the others. :5. Paternalism ‚Äì considered as going in search of strong authority, leader ‚Äì ‚Äûquasi father‚Äù ‚Äì who assures missing order, hierarchical harmony and predictability of the group‚Äôs life. :6. Externalization ‚Äì meaning transferring trust in other external groups or communities together with a tendency to idealize the procedure of operations, organizational solutions or total quality of an institution of a targeted group. :7. Excessive assistance of legal institutions ‚Äì when businessmen do not trust each other, they need formal means to secure the transaction (for instance, detailed contracts, bank guarantees, employing certifying notary, and tendency to sue). Application Trust management needs to be put in practice. The strategy that leads to this is trust building. The rules of trust creation refer to rules and guidelines which have a far- reaching influence on the formation and development of trust. Trust building is the kind of the management strategy because it is strongly focused not only on the present, but first of all on the future cooperation. The level of trust determines not only individual development, but above everything else it fosters the social and economic evolution of the whole communities. Therefore, trust management is the best solution to develop. However, it is possible only when people act in the atmosphere of trust where trust culture in commonly acceptable and required by every member of the society. Culture of trust Trust culture stands for disseminated in society rules which oblige every citizen to treat trust and trustworthiness as common shared values. In this culture well-rooted norm is to redeem the obligations, be honest, open to collaborate with others. Trust culture negates the existence of corruption. Culture of trust is helpful in insecure and unorganized situations.(Bjerke, 1999) Trust can be recognized as the strategy of dealing with uncertainty. Distrust culture is based on cynicism, disorder, corruption, exploiting others, deceiving, great care. In order to function in distrust culture there are implemented various formal legal remedies. Trust has focal meaning for the success of every transaction. It stimulates the human activities. In countries with trust culture there is higher social well- being and economic growth.(Fukuyama 1995) In distrust culture those who trust in others are believed to be naive and simple-minded and they are the victims of unfair transactions. Cynicism limits the collaboration, the freedom of activity, destroys communication and divides people. Trust is depreciated. Building trust Building trust has special meaning for social capital. According to Putnam trust is one of elements constituting social capital, together with norms and networks. Without this capital there is impossible the economical and social growth and building capitalism and democracy. Citizens need to have the feeling that they influence state affairs and live in the country characterized by culture of trust. Fukuyama, American politician, economist and political philosopher brought forward the issue of trust and social capital in his famous book entitled Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity.New York: Free Press, 1995 References ;Notes * Bjerke, B., Business leadership and culture.

The prison is operated by Serco. History Lowdham Grange Prison was opened as a privately financed, constructed and managed prison in 1998. Soon after the jail opened, it emerged that one of Lowdham Grange's new prisoner custody officers had previously been employed as a security guard for the gangster Reggie Kray. The officer subsequently resigned from his post at the prison. In 2004, the National Audit Office praised the prison as one of seven prisons providing exceptionally good value. However, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons carried out an inspection of Lowdham Grange in March 2004 and reported that though the prison was well managed, \\"100 prisoners on average were not busy enough\\" in employment or education. Low staffing levels were also identified as a problem at the jail, though inspectors stated that the prison did have control of its prisoners. In August 2005 Lowdham Grange's Board of Visitors reported an increase in violent behaviour amongst inmates. There was also an increase in drugs found at the prison. However the Board claimed that Lowdham Grange was \\"doing better overall than the Prison Service strictly requires.\\" In June 2006 a prisoner serving 10 years for burglary escaped from Lowdham Grange by hiding in a shipment of chef hats, which are manufactured in the prison's workshop. The Chief Inspector of Prisons carried out an un- announced inspection of Lowdham Grange in 2008. The Inspectorate noted that the prison had much improved, and was well managed. However the prison was also told to do more to improve work opportunities for inmates, improve resettlement services for prisoners leaving custody, and set up an accredited drug treatment programme for inmates. In May 2008 it was announced that the Lowdham Grange Prison was to be expanded by more than a third. The ¬£52 million project, expected to be complete by 2010, would create 260 more cells, a two- storey activities building, as well as expanding and refurbishing existing buildings. In September 2009, Lowdham Grange Prison was awarded Level Four status by the National Offender Management Service for exceptional delivery. The prison today Lowdham Grange is a Category B closed training prison for adult males serving both determinate and non-determinate sentences (IPP). Accommodation at the prison consists mainly of single occupancy cells, with some double cells. Some cells have en-suite shower facilities. The prison offers workshops, education and training for inmates in areas such as bricklaying, plumbing, electronics, painting and decorating and industrial cleaning. All work and training programmes can lead to NVQ qualifications in related fields. There is a Visitor Centre outside the main gate at Lowdham Grange. There are limited refreshment facilities available in the Visits Hall inside the prison. Both the Visitor Centre and Visits Hall have full access for disabled visitors. There have been allegations that prison officers committed serious assaults against prisoners including throwing a handcuffed prisoner down stairs. Serco, that runs the prison denies the allegations. Violence has been rising at Lowdham Grange assaults have risen yearly since 2009. There were 318 assaults in 2017 and 237 in 2016, the 2017 number was over twice the number of assaults in 2014. Roughly two thirds of assaults were prisoners assaulting other prisoners, one third involved prisoners assaulting staff. There were 162 cases of self harm in the first three months of 2018, there were 402 self harm cases in 2017 and 288 in 2016. Two prisoners died in 2017 and one died up to August in 2018. Serco refused to tell the BBC how many prison officers were based at Lowdam Grange. The most recent inspection, in 2015 decided staff use of force \\"was very high\\" and not invariably \\"fully justified or warranted\\". The last inspection by HM Inspector of Prisons found violence against staff and prisoners had increased since a 2011 inspection and was much higher than in comparable establishments. The prison had become less safe, there was too much violence against staff and against other prisoners and too much of it was serious. The inspection also concluded \\"use of force was very high\\", inspectors were not convinced it \\"was always fully justified or warranted and not all incidents were de-escalated as quickly as they might have been\\". Self harm had risen and was higher than in similar prisons, there were, \\"unacceptable waiting times to see health professionals\\". Prisoners had \\"little confidence in the complaints system\\" and there were more complaints than in similar prisons. Inspectors found cases of complaints that were not properly investigated or answered. The Independent Monitoring Board found, \\"levels of violence between prisoners and, on occasions towards staff were of concern\\". It said, \\"Injuries sustained by prisoners were sometimes quite serious and required hospital treatment. Assaults on staff were rarer but still occurred and sometimes required hospital treatment.\\" During the year there were at least 25 times when a, \\"command suit\\" was needed to manage \\"serious incidents\\". Incidents included prisoners balancing on railings, building barricades, groups of prisoners engaged in \\"concerted indiscipline\\" and apparent hostage situations. The board maintained it observed some incidents and was, \\"impressed by the efficient, calm and humane way in which the incidents were managed\\". Use of psychoactive substances was, \\"worryingly high\\" and was one cause of violence. Low staffing levels made it difficult to manage prisoners and, \\"the proportion of inexperienced staff contributed to challenging atmospheres on some wings\\". The report said, \\"Staffing was seldom at the agreed level during the year.\\" The Monitoring Board was also concerned over how many prisoners with mental health problems were in segregation for long time periods and raised concerns over how many prisoners preferred to stay in their cells during the day. The building where most healthcare took place was unfit for the purpose. Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform said, \\"This has been a long hot summer, and it sounds like Lowdham Grange has problems. Perhaps it is time for the inspectorate to conduct an inspection, as only one report has been published on the prison in the last seven years. This illustrates how prisons can deteriorate very quickly. They also show how important it is for prisons to have robust and imaginative management and careful oversight of staff.\\" References External links Category B prisons in England Prisons in Nottinghamshire 1998 establishments in England Private prisons in the United Kingdom Men's prisons Serco ","title":"HM Prison Lowdham Grange"},{"id":"20615597","text":"\\"When I Consider How My Light is Spent\\" is one of the best known of the sonnets of John Milton (1608‚Äì1674). The last three lines are particularly well known; they conclude with \\"They also serve who only stand and wait\\", which is much quoted though rarely in context. Variants of it have been used as mottos in a number of contexts, for example the Dickin Medal for service animals bears the motto \\"We also serve\\", and the Navy Wives Clubs of America uses the motto \\"They Also Serve, Who Stay and Wait\\". In U.S. popular culture it is perhaps best known for Hall of Fame baseball broadcaster Vin Scully, who would quote it when showing a player not in the game. The sonnet was first published in Milton's 1673 Poems in his autograph notebook, known as the \\"Trinity Manuscript\\" from its location in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He gave it the number 19, but in the published book it was numbered 16,Kelley, M. (1956). Milton's later sonnets and the Cambridge manuscript. Modem Philology, 54, 20-25.Revard, S. P. (Ed.), (2009). John Milton: Collected Shorter Poems. Chichester, UK: Wiley () so both numbers are used for it. It is popularly given the title On His Blindness, but there is no evidence that Milton used this title; it was assigned a century later by Thomas Newton in his 1761 edition of Milton's poetry,Newton, T. (1761). The poetical works of John Milton: with notes of various authors (3 vols.). London: J. and R. Tonson. as was commonly done at the time by editors of posthumous collections.Ferry, A. The title to the poem. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press () It is always assumed that the poem was written after the publication of Milton's 1645 Poems. It may have been written as early as 1652, although most scholars believe that it was composed sometime between June and October 1655, when Milton's blindness was essentially complete. However, most discussions of the dating depend on the assumption that Newton's title reflects Milton's intentions, which may not be true. More reliable evidence of the date of the poem comes from the fact that it appears in the \\"Trinity Manuscript\\", which is believed to contain material written between about 1631 and 1659 and that it is not written in Milton's own handwriting, but that of a scribe who also wrote out several other of the sonnets to which Milton assigned higher numbers.Shawcross, J. T. (1959). Notes on Milton's amanuenses. Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 58, 29-38. HaskinHaskin, D. (1994). Milton's burden of interpretation. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press () discusses some of the likely interpretative errors that readers have made as a result of assuming that the common title of the poem is authentic. For example, the \\"one talent\\" that Milton mourns his inability to use is not necessarily his poetic ability; it might as easily be his ability to translate texts from foreign languages, the task for which he was responsible in the Commonwealth government. However, the references to light and darkness in the poem make it virtually certain that Milton's blindness was at least a secondary theme. The sonnet is in the Petrarchan form, with the rhyme scheme but adheres to the Miltonic conception of the form, with a greater usage of enjambment. Text : When I consider how my light is spent, : Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide, : And that one Talent which is death to hide : Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent : To serve therewith my Maker, and present : My true account, lest he returning chide; : ‚ÄúDoth God exact day-labour, light denied?‚Äù : I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent : That murmur, soon replies, ‚ÄúGod doth not need : Either man‚Äôs work or his own gifts; who best : Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state : Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed : And post o‚Äôer Land and Ocean without rest: : They also serve who only stand and wait.‚Äù  Meaning  When Milton writes \\"that one talent which is death to hide\\" he is specifically alluding to the parable of the talents in the Gospel of Matthew.David V. Urban, \\"The Talented Mr. Milton: A Parabolic Laborer and His Identity\\" in Milton Studies, Volume 43, Albert C. Labriola (ed.), Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2004, , pp. 1‚Äì18.

His parents, Richard and Ann, farmed at Sladehouse and Thomas took over the business as a yeoman farmer even while his father was alive.Rev Dr Alexander Gordon of Belfast \\"Ancient and Modern Muggletonians\\" Liverpool: privately printed (1870) p. 38 His faith was initially PresbyterianThomas Tomkinson \\"Truth's Triumph\\" Covent Garden: W. Smith (1823) p. 258 but in 1661 he read a book by Laurence Clarkson (presumably The Lost Sheep Found) and became attracted to Muggletonianism. Earlier, in February 1652, he had had a revelatory experience similar to the one Lodowicke Muggleton reported in 1650 but without any experience of the direct voice of God which had come to John Reeve and which was the foundation experience of Muggletonianism. Since John Reeve died in 1658, these dates mean that Tomkinson was one of the first prominent Muggletonian personalities not to have known Reeve personally. Life Tomkinson visited London and met Lodowicke Muggleton on Mayday 1662. He returned to Staffordshire and married, Ann, shortly afterwards. He converted a sizeable number of family, friends and neighbours to the new faith, enough to make himself a nuisance to the parish authorities. He said he managed to keep the peace only \\"through a little money and friendship\\".Christopher Hill, Barry Reay and William Lamont \\"The World of the Muggletonians\\" London: Maurice Temple Smith (1983) p. 44 On 9 December 1664 he was blessed by Lodowicke Muggleton. In 1674 he found himself in serious trouble on account of his beliefs and, to evade arrest, contemplated emigrating to New England but was talked out of it by Muggleton. Around 1680 he moved permanently to London. It is unclear how he made his living. Part of the time he followed Muggleton's trade of tailoring but he also had plans to wholesale cheese and butter in the capital. He still signed his writings, however, as from Sladehouse. On 10 July 1684, Thomas and Ann's daughter, Anne, was blessed by Lodowicke Muggleton. Lodowicke Muggleton died in 1698 and Tomkinson is credited by Professor Lamont as \\"the man who prevented the religion from imploding after Muggleton's death\\" which is what Muggleton himself thought would happen.William Lamont \\"Last Witnesses\\" Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing (2006) p. 113 He is thus crucial to how a small sect survived. Tomkinson was Muggleton's literary executor, preparing and editing Muggleton's autobiographical \\"Acts of the Witnesses\\" leaving out some of the more contested astronomical assertions. Tomkinson is quite open in his introduction as to the deletions he made. Thomas Tomkinson died in London in 1710 and was succeeded as unofficial leader of the Muggletonians by Arden Bonell (? ‚Äì 1746) Ideas Tomkinson's conversion experience had been a difficult one. \\"What a great deal of pain to please the unsatisfied fancy of one particular man,\\" Muggleton had grumbled.Lamont \\"Last Witnesses\\" p. 21 Tomkinson had been attracted to Muggletonianism by the radical humanity of their God. Every Muggletonian agreed God was the man Christ Jesus; necessarily and sufficiently. One of Tomkinson's subsequent books was called \\"None but Christ\\". But it mattered intensely to him that Christ had not known of his divinity whilst on this earth, else his humanity was inauthentic. John Reeve had inclined to think Christ had awareness, at least at some stage. But, \\"Mr Clarkson in his Wonder of Wonders said he did not know himself to be the only God.\\"Lamont \\"Last Witnesses p. 64 referring to Laurence Clarkson Muggleton affected sagely indifference. For Tomkinson, Christ had lived, died and lain in a grave for three days entirely as a man. By what power, then, did this man ascend to heaven? There has to be an answer else the crucifixion is the final death of God: indeed, God's suicide. The standard Muggletonian reply is that during Christ's sojourn on earth, the affairs of heaven were managed by Elijah (perhaps in partnership with Moses and Enoch). Elijah had temporary control of God's prerogative power, easily adequate to a resurrection and glorious return. Such a view seems to fit nicely with the transfiguration story. It also explains the crowd at the crucifixion crying out, \\"Behold, he calleth Elias.\\"Gospel of St Mark 15:35) But the monotheism of the whole enterprise is dangerously compromised. On one hand, there is a God in the form of the man Christ Jesus. On the other hand, there is a man Elijah, directly translated to heaven without death, capable of exercising God's full prerogative power. Where remains the dividing line between creator and created?John Saddington, an earlier writer, prefers to emphasize a different argument; namely that although the body and soul of the man Jesus were both authentically dead there remained the divine quickening power to restore vitality. Does this come dangerously close to 'spirits without a body'? Perhaps neither explanation is wholly satisfactory. Tomkinson's most original contribution to Muggletonian belief was to adapt the theory of 'the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman', which John Reeve had expounded in A Divine Looking-Glass, to produce a doctrine of predestination that avoided the perceived pessimism of Calvin's model. Muggletonians felt Calvin portrayed God as a kind of capricious tyrant because Calvinism allowed only for 'one seed' which rendered the whole of humanity abject. Tomkinson also toned down Muggleton's implacable hostility to reason, accepting that reason had its uses in everyday life but was no substitute for faith. The term 'sober reason' was coined to imply reason subordinated to faith. Tomkinson's most lasting contribution may have been to stress that there was no dividing line between the ideas of Lodowicke Muggleton and those of John Reeve. This topic was a source of splits and dissent amongst Muggletonians, some believing that Muggleton, alone, had insisted that God took no immediate notice of everyday human activities. Tomkinson is perhaps the first Muggletonian intellectual. At least, one of the first influenced by the wider history of ideas. His writings are profusely illustrated by references to classical authors, church fathers, and western philosophers. Muggleton himself was probably well-read but made a point of relying on a mix of scriptural quotation and plain common-sense, which he felt to be the key to avoiding the opposing traps of scriptural literalism and the imaginings of reason. \\"A Practical Discourse upon the General Epistle by Jude\\" Tomkinson's most important work from the sect's perspective was \\"A Practical Discourse upon the General Epistle by Jude\\". This was probably the last book Tomkinson wrote and he did so at the request of William Hall, a Derbyshire Muggletonian.First printed 1757, reprinted at Deal for James May in 1822. Further reprinted by Kessinger, 2008 Although only a short work of 25 verses, the Epistle of Jude was of disproportionate significance to Muggletonians. Its darkly poetic language seemed to give scriptural support to important Muggletonian ideas. * The writer of Jude knows and esteems the Book of Enoch even though this work was lost in Tomkinson's day. The subsequent rediscovery in Western Europe of EnochThe Muggletonians did not produce their own edition of Enoch but they did reprint a glossary of names and difficult words from the book. Signification of the proper names occurring in the Book of Enoch from the Hebrew & Chaldee Rev. D. A. De Sola London: Isaac Frost (1852) did much to bolster the Muggletonian view that they were on the right track.Isaac Frost's Two systems of Astronomy (1846) was directly inspired by this Since Jude and Revelation are the two concluding books of the New Testament, they seemed to point ahead to a Third Commission and to a Muggletonian future. According to modern exegesis,For example, John Norman Davidson Kelly Commentary on the Epistles of Peter and Jude London: A&C; Black (1969) verses 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 and 21 of Jude draw upon the book of Enoch whilst verse 6 can be derived from nowhere else and verses 14 and 15 give an openly acknowledged quote from it. What was generally important about Enoch was that he was the seventh from Adam (considered an auspiciously holy number), that he walked with God, and that he was translated directly from life on earth to heaven. What is important in the specific context of Jude is that Enoch is sufficient prophet of the reprobates' doom because, unusually, Enoch claimed to be a prophet of future times, not of his own. He alone, it was said, knew the secrets of time, whereas the rest of us know nothing. * Jude incorporates, at verse 12, the concept of the 'second death'. * Jude propagates the notion that a pre-existent Christ can be seen at work in the Old Testament. Christ is more than simply foretold. One ancient rendering of Jude uses the term 'the God Christ' and elsewhere the expression 'our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ' is used.This is disputed, however. Apparently the Greek would be the same whether one or two entities were referenced This is exactly what Muggletonians wanted to read. * Jude's expression in verse 4 about men \\"who were long ago marked out for condemnation\\" is highly compatible with the doctrine of the two seeds. * What is important about Cain, in Jude's interpretation is not so much his slaying his brother, but that this is a specific instance of his being \\"a child of the Evil One.\\"1 John 3: 12 which is congruent to Muggletonian belief.Canon J. N. D. Kelly Commentrary on the Epistles of Peter and Jude p. 267 * Jude disparages those false prophets who rely upon visions to bolster their opinions. No view could be more Muggletonian than this. * Jude defends the reputation of the angels against those who deride them as cohorts of a demiurge.Some of the Christian gnostics were of this view. Canon Kelly (p. 267) says that certain sects went so far as to see Cain, Esau and Korah as the justified ones, freedom fighters against a 'creator God' who is the bringer of evil, but for Muggletonians this is 'unclean reason' at work. * Jude advances the role of the prophet as the proper channel to expound God's will to people who should not rely upon their own lights and fancies in these matters. Tomkinson uses his own book to promote a doctrine of election. He attacks, on one hand, the possibility of universal grace and, on the other, the belief that one can be saved by one's own efforts. He argues that people who hold to these views end up presuming to judge God by human standards. Besides, he suspects that those driven to deny election are motivated by fears for their own status. Only faith saves. \\"The world's faith is grounded upon tradition.\\" God gave faith only once in the age of innocence. \\"There is no new faith given but the old awakened.\\"\\"A practical discourse upon the general epistle by Jude\\" Deal: James May (1822) p. 25 Those who die in faith do so with the assurance that, after the sleep of the grave, they will enjoy resurrection in both body and soul, in a new glorified condition. Those who lack this assurance, die in fear that their lot will be 'a second death'. We know this because Enoch taught it. Using Jude's language, he likens the preachers of the established churches to wandering stars. They \\"shall always be learning but never come to the knowledge of the truth\\".\\"A practical discourse\\" p. 95 What about those who, in the time of the Third Commission, do not accept that faith but who, nevertheless, try to live lives of innocency? Will they be saved? Tomkinson thinks not.\\"A practical discourse\\" p. 91 Their sincerity is matched by their spiritual ineffectualness because they cannot let go the apparent security and worldly attractions of reason. Ultimately, the seed of reason triumphs over the seed of faith in them and they go down. And to what a shuddering fate! At the end of time, those left behind on this abandoned earth \\"in which darkness they shall hear one another's doleful cries and cursed blasphemies, but shall never see one another's dreadful faces; neither can they stir from the place of their resurrection having bodies as heavy as lead and as black as pitch.\\"\\"A practical discourse\\" p. 97 Thus, then and now, hell is an accusing conscience.There is no direct evidence as to whom the writer of Jude was. It seems generally agreed he was a Jewish Christian writing for a gentile Christian audience but this is an inference drawn from the text itself. The apostles are talked about in the past tense so the book is likely pseudonymous. What it may reveal is the intense sensitivity of Muggletonians to the Jewish strand in Christianity in the first two centuries after Christ's life on earth. No modern historian seems yet to have investigated this. \\"The Muggletonian Principles Prevailing\\" Only two of Tomkinson's books were printed during his lifetime. One, \\"The Muggletonian Principles Prevailing\\", printed 1695, is a reply to Dr John Williams' anonymous pamphlet called \\"A true representation of the absurd and mischievous principles of the sect called Muggletonians\\" (1694). It is interesting Dr Williams felt the Muggletonians worthy of notice. He makes individual, scriptural objections rather than a sustained critique. Most of the points had already been raked over in the disputes between Muggleton and the Quakers, so Tomkinson follows Muggleton's lead in the main. Dr Williams has most success with the Book of Revelation. He wants to know why John Reeve says one reprobate angel fell when scripture says many such angels fell. This matters: it is central to Muggletonianism that one angel was cast from heaven to earth to impregnate Eve (and to perish in the process) thus causing Cain to be the first offspring of the 'seed of the serpent' and for the perpetuation of evil to take place on our earth. However, Revelation 12:9 says, \\"that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him\\". Tomkinson simply denies any 'rebellion in heaven' as described in Revelation 12:7Thomas Tomkinson \\"Muggletonian Principles Prevailing\\" Deal: James May (1822) p. 40 Such angels, he says, are merely Cain's offspring on this earth. But Tomkinson cannot summon the insouciance one might have expected Muggleton to have wielded at this point. For Muggleton, Williams would have been a misguided 'literalist' who, besotted with reason, failed to read Revelation in the manner appropriate to the last days. However, Dr Williams could have driven his point about Revelation a lot further. Professor Lamont Lamont \\"Last Witnesses\\" p. 52 shows that neither Reeve nor Muggleton ever really got to grips with the question of how they knew they were the Two Witnesses of Revelation 11:3. God, when he spoke to Reeve, did not tell him so. The best Muggleton could do was to say that he and Reeve had defeated John Robins, that Robins was clearly the anti-Christ and that it was the job of the Witnesses to destroy the anti-Christ. Thus, Reeve and Muggleton must be the Two Witnesses. Perhaps inevitably, Dr Williams questions the Muggletonians' professed power to curse and to bless. Here, Tomkinson strikes out on his own saying that this is none other than the gospel power to bind and to loose.\\"Muggletonian Principles Prevailing\\" p. 22 Muggleton might have put the emphasis differently ‚Äì with one eye on the legal code. Muggleton had never been tried in court for cursing even though The Blasphemy Act 1650 had criminalised it. But Muggleton knew there never was any law against simply saying a man is damned. So, Muggletonians pronounced sentence upon reprobates whose behaviour clearly showed the seed of the serpent at work within them. It was this seed within which caused their damnation. The sentence was merely stating the obvious. \\"A System of Religion\\" This bookThomas Tomkinson A System of Religion First printed (posthumously) 1729. Revised and reprinted for Isaac Frost, William Cates and Joseph Gandar. Clerkenwell: T. Goode (1857) has seven topics *Christ, the one God *The nature of the Trinity *The Devil is nowhere to be found but in man *Of the soul's dying with the body to await resurrection *The two seeds and how to know which predominates *Predestination *Resurrection of the saints The anonymous preface, presumably from 1729, says that Thomas Tomkinson's aim is to show the Muggletonian faith to be systematic and in accord with philosophical empiricism. His target is atheism, not other Christians. He says he will employ \\"mere faith\\" and the plain-sense meaning of scripture (which the 'atheistic enthusiast' is unlikely to accept anyway) scorning to employ reason \\"though it would make for his purpose.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion preface page (v) The modern reader may be disappointed that Tomkinson never engages with the arguments of Thomas Hobbes but sticks to preaching to the converted.William Lamont Last Witnesses p. 124/5 lists the points of agreement between Hobbes and the Muggletonians as mortalism, materialism, determinism, prayers as 'attributes of intention', dreams and devils as projections of fear, witches and sorcery as old wives' tales, an apocalyptic reading of history, and others His first two topics, Christ the one God, and The Nature of the Trinity, can be taken together. Tomkinson starts from the monotheism of the Holy One of Israel who will not give his glory to another. Only that way can God derive his perfection from himself. Without that, what sort of God do we have?Tomkinson System of Religion p. 17 Meaningful unity of body and spirit is only possible if spirits cannot depart from bodily form. Tomkinson argues that God cannot be an infinite spirit else we would all have something of that spirit within us and there would not \\"remain an everlasting distinction between the changeable creature and the unchangeable Creator.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 8/9 Humans can only describe things in terms derived from their own experience. It would make no sense to ask 'what was before God?' because our experience is a total blank.Tomkinson System of Religion p. 5 God has purposes of which we clearly know nothing so, in addition to his gracious side turned towards us, there are other sides which sometimes appear wrathful. To say God is father, son and holy ghost is in the same style as saying a human being is body, soul and spirit \\"united and knit together\\".Tomkinson System of Religion p. 17 God is not just a trinity but a whole world within himself: a Kingdom or a City and in everything an internal harmony. We, too, on this earth should cherish inner harmony as a foretaste of the paradise which will follow resurrection. God's word is a power and works like a \\"glorious wheel, that moved him to form living creatures to appear in his sight.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 7 Or, as Tomkinson neatly summarises it, \\"He that was the seedsman became seed himself.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 3 On his third topic, \\"The Devil is not a spirit in the air but a lying lustful spirit in the heart\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 39 which is well described by the scriptural phrase: 'hardening of the heart'. So, people cannot slough off responsibility for their own sins onto an external tempter. \\"I tell thee thy sins are begot by thine own intention, hatched in thine own heart, and acted by thine own will; so that thou weavest the web of thine own woe.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 54 The fourth and seventh topics, Resurrection and the Soul, can be taken together. Adam's living soul was, in a single essence, the breath of God and the dust of the earth.Tomkinson System of Religion p. 56 It is because a soul is always with a body that it is capable of sin. \\"If you say evil comes by imitation, try it, lock up a child from evil company and see if the seed of its own evil lust and appetites will not bud forth and produce evil.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 59 God does not attend the begetting of each new child. Procreation does its own work. Every person will die the first death of mortality but it is obedience to sin which causes the second, eternal death. Thus \\"every sin is not unto death\\" meaning the second death. On the first death, the saints do not go to heaven but sleep with the fathers in the earth. Lazarus was not called back from heaven but from the grave. In Tomkinson's view it is the false doctrine of the soul leaving the body at death to migrate straight to heaven which is the cause of much foolish martyrdom and suicide. Such false doctrine is zealously promoted by rulers whose self-interest lies in their citizens and soldiers killing and being killed for glory. Tomkinson believes this stems from the pagan notion of Elysium. No one is judged at the first death else they would be judged twice.Tomkinson System of Religion p. 90 He quotes Revelation 20:13&14 \\"And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.\\" We should not think of our resurrection as the 'springing back to life' of our old bodies, but of a quickening of our seed ‚Äì like the seed corn which rots in the earth yet comes to life anew when its time is due. This has an egalitarian slant to it: no saint will be resurrected except as all saints are resurrected. The remainder of the book deals with Predestination and the Two Seeds. Knowledge is an awareness of good and evil. The irony is that we gain an understanding of what we have lost in the process. Because we have all inherited something down the generations from Adam, our situation, although made baleful by our parallel inheritance from Cain, is not hopeless. This mixed process is said to have begun when the sons of Seth took wives from the daughters of evil men.Tomkinson System of Religion p. 92 his citation Genesis 6:2 may not be entirely apt And it is the meaning of \\"God loved Jacob and hated Esau before they had done either good or evil\\" which, says Tomkinson, is an example of the impotence of free-will and human desiring, for \\"The potter hath power over the clay.\\"Tomkinson System of Religion p. 111 The choice is God's and cannot be forced. Good works coming to fruition are not the cause of salvation but evidence that the seed of faith is alive and well in a person. \\"None but Christ\\" None but ChristThomas Tomkinson The Harmony of the Three Commissions or None but Christ written 1692, printed as abridged by the author, 1757, reprinted for James May Deal: T. C. Annall (1822) is a huge survey of the whole of scripture designed to show that every divinely-inspired 'personality' from Moses to St Thomas Apostle believed, as Muggletonians believe, that Christ was the Holy One of Israel. Hence its title, None but Christ. But, if the message of scripture is so clear and unanimous, why had it become such a minority view by Thomas Tomkinson's time? His answer is that, after its first three hundred years of existence, Christianity was absorbed by the state and misused ever since for the state's own purposes.Tomkinson General Epistle by Jude chapters 5 and 12 to 15 This oppressive situation will continue until the seventh anti-church (Quakers) expires. Some readers may find the book obsolete. Its myopic dissection of the text approximates the kind of 'bible literalism' Muggletonians condemn in others. Tomkinson writes at a time when an understanding of the way the text has come down to us was unavailable. It might have been hoped that, with the whole of scripture ranged before him, Tomkinson would have chosen to tackle those texts which seem hardest to square with Muggletonian beliefs. For example, Christ's exorcisms or statements where Trinitarian distinctions are most pronounced. Sadly, he does not. He does little more than introduce some interesting topics, such as whether Isaiah was put to death for proclaiming an embodied God. \\"The Mystery of Faith\\" The Mystery of FaithThomas Tomkinson The Mystery of Faith prepared for the press from manuscript by Samuel Morris Bailey (1823) and issued with General Epistle by Jude thus the pagination commences at p. 127 deals with four topics:- * where faith's components come from and why faith is a mystery * how the components fit together to give faith * sin, as the opponent of faith * how to make progress in faith \\"In the days of the voice of the Seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the Mystery of God shall be finished.\\" Just as God is a mystery, so faith in God is a mystery, too. It is a knowledge of things unseen and thus it is what links us to God because it is that part of our natures which comes from God through Adam and Eve. Faith is an operation of God; let no man glory in manhood. \\"All is but a tale, dream, or shadow, till faith comes to open the door of the heart.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 135 No new faith is given but Adam's old faith is rewakened. God does not speak directly to the faithful but through his prophets because they speak with the spirit. This process of renewal had a definite beginning with Ezekiel 11: 19 and with Jeremiah 31:31. It is a new covenant in the form of a law of faith. In this, a new heart replaces the old heart. This old heart was defective because it was always divided between the letter and the spirit. 12 apostles were needed to preach the second commission but a whole tribe of Levi, the first. \\"So likewise is the old heart given in Levi, which will have the old law of the old tabernacle forms, and multitudes of blind priests must be maintained for their fruitless prayers, outward formalities and simple ninny's.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 146 Faith needs few preachers. \\"This made the prophet Isaiah say, Lord who believes our report: and Elias was alone.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 148 Faith is most marvelous \\"as it stands still, viewing and beholding.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 131 Thus the apostles' faith was their simple wonderment at what Christ said and did. Faith is such that although many behold the same events and hear the same speech, some believe and some don't. \\"This is turning the world upside down.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 152 Tomkinson sees the fight against sin to be won by putting into the field proportionate and opposite forces of faith at an early stage. \\"Many people do err exceedingly by believing that an evil thought do break the law; but the evil thought doth not break the law as well as the evil deed and this belief of theirs occasions much wickedness, for when they conceive they have broken the law ... they upon this let loose the reins of their lust.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 165 More serious sins, such as murder, cannot take hold unless preceded by smaller sins like envy and strife. Tomkinson recognises there is such a thing as righteous anger. But it should not lead to vengeance because that belongs to the Lord. \\"Fret not against evil doers,\\" he says, \\"to vex other men is only to teach them how to vex you.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 170 Tomkinson's perusal of various sins gives rise to some interesting observations. Riches are to be sought to the extent that the attainment of them takes away the longing for riches. (This might be the Muggletonian motto.) \\"Pride is the occasion and cause of persecution and oppression\\" because the proud do scorn all not of their mind. \\"It is humility that pricks the bladder and lets forth all the puffing wind.\\"Tomkinson Mystery of faith p. 184 Love and faith go together like body and soul. \\"Faith is not seen to be faith if love do not shew it.\\" Faith in the heart and conscience is the only acceptable form of worship. \\"We do not serve God for salvation, but from salvation.\\" There is no need to call on him to save us. \\"Truth's Triumph\\" Truth's Triumph is described as Tomkinson's major work.Lamont Last Witnesses p. 141 This work was published during Tomkinson's lifetime. Collected works A two volume set called Tomkinson's Works was produced by the London Muggletonians at some time between 1873 and 1887. It is similar in style to the three volume set \\"Miscellaneous Works of Reeve and Muggleton\\" which was produced by the Frost brothers in 1832 but is less sumptuous being bound in boards and purple cloth, and lacking any special preface. However, like the 1832 set, it is not a new printing, being existing publications trimmed to size and bound more adequately. As a result, volume 1 is not entirely uniform with volume 2, the former being royal octavo, the later octavo. Manuscripts Many of Tomkinson's writings circulated only in manuscript. Copying them out was considered a good way to study them. Not all are now known entire. Other fragmentary writings exist. Those known to have circulated widely are:- * Joyfull newes from heaven for the Jewes are called (undated) * A survey of the scripture (undated) * Zions Sonnes (1679) This may have been printed but it has not been reprinted. It is in the form of an appeal to a relative who had left the faith. * The souls struggle (1681) * The Christian Convarte (1692). This was the beginnings of a biographical sketch. * The mystery of Godlyness (1692) * White divell uncased (undated) * White divell uncased (1704) which is a different work from the above.

She is portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski and is one of two agents assigned by the NSA and CIA to protect Chuck Bartowski after he unwittingly downloads the secret government computer known as the Intersect into his brain. Throughout the series, she is Chuck's primary love interest and initially poses as Chuck's girlfriend to conceal their identities as spies from the public. In the Season 4 finale, \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\", Chuck and Sarah were married, dismissed from government service, and given ownership of Volkoff Industries, with which they bought the Burbank Buy More and the secret Castle base thereunder. During the final three episodes of season 5, Sarah gets her memories suppressed due to a faulty Intersect upload, the signs of recovery from which are exhibited throughout the final episode. Biography Very little about Sarah's past is revealed throughout the series. According to one dossier, she was born in May 1982, though Chuck stated she was 28 years old before he met her father for the first time in a 2008 episode.\\"Chuck Versus the DeLorean\\" The only people outside of her family confirmed to know her real name, \\"Sam\\", were Director Graham, Daniel Shaw, and Chuck; she confessed her middle name is Lisa.\\"Chuck Versus the Wookiee\\" The relationship between her parents began to fall apart after her father's disastrous proposal,\\"Chuck Versus the Balcony\\" and Sarah and her father were largely on their own at least as early as 1988.\\"Chuck Versus the Wedding Planner\\" Her father was a con artist she introduced to Chuck as \\"Jack Burton,\\" and much of her youth was spent moving from city to city under a series of aliases, actively participating in her father's schemes.\\"Chuck Versus Santa Claus\\" Sarah spent at least some of the ten years between 1988 and 1998 in the care of her grandmother, who did not think much of her father. Sarah attended at least her senior year of high school‚Äîand graduated in 1998‚Äîunder the alias of Jenny Burton. Sometime in 1998 before her graduation, Sarah's father was arrested for his own protection after a scam went wrong. He left her a hidden cache of money for just such an emergency, and it was while recovering this cache that she was first approached by CIA Director Graham. He took her in as a protege after remarking on her many aliases and gave her the cover name of Sarah Walker. Although apparently \\"recruited\\" at this point, flashbacks make it clear that she continued in high school; several of the popular children cruelly mocked her as the \\"jailbird's daughter\\" because of her father's imprisonment. Sarah was (officially) recruited out of Harvard University.NBC.com: Spy Dossiers She also spent a year with the Secret Service.\\"Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte\\" Sarah's earliest known assignment after being recruited was with the C.A.T. (Clandestine Attack Team) Squad, a team of female spies that also included Sarah's DEA friend, Carina Miller. The team eventually broke up in 2003, when Sarah discovered a bug indicating one of the members, Zondra, was a traitor. Although Zondra was cleared by a government inquiry, their relationship was strained. Sarah's CIA \\"red test,\\" or first kill, was Evelyn Shaw in 2005. Sarah was given no background information about her target, and couldn't check on the kill because she had to flee from the scene before police arrived. Also beginning in 2005 Sarah was partnered with Chuck's former friend and college roommate Bryce Larkin. Their professional relationship eventually evolved into an intimate one. After Bryce went rogue, Sarah was assigned to Budapest under the handling of Kieran Ryker.\\"Chuck Versus the Baby\\" In 2006 Ryker assigned Sarah to retrieve a \\"package\\" that turned out to be a baby girl, but Sarah discovered Ryker was corrupt and left the baby with her mother, who was unknown to the CIA. Sarah cut off all contact in order to protect them and to make sure the baby grew up having the normal life Sarah never got. Afterward, Director Graham sent Sarah to Burbank to investigate why Larkin sent an email to Chuck Bartowski. In 2011, when Ryker resurfaced and found out that Sarah's mother had the child, now called Molly, Sarah saved them from him and was reunited with her mother and adopted sister. Series =Season 1= When Bryce apparently goes rogue to steal the Intersect computer, Sarah‚Äînot realizing that he did so to protect it from a cabal of rogue spies called Fulcrum‚Äîfeels both personally and professionally betrayed. Sarah is subsequently assigned by Graham to attempt to recover the Intersect. The only lead is the e-mail Bryce sent to Chuck, and she tracks Chuck down to the Buy More where, posing as a customer with a broken phone, she first makes contact.\\"Chuck Versus the Intersect\\" Sarah soon becomes one of Chuck Bartowski's two government handlers. She is partnered with NSA agent John Casey and assigned the task of protecting Chuck. This extends to acting on information Chuck \\"flashes\\" on. As part of her cover, Sarah pretends to be Chuck's girlfriend. One of the complications and the main focus on the development of her character throughout the series is that although initially she insists this is only part of her cover, a genuine romantic interest grows between them. While Sarah herself is initially slow to recognize or acknowledge her feelings, other characters have readily picked up on her attraction to Chuck. Sarah's DEA friend Carina is one of the first to recognize that Sarah's feelings for Chuck are more than merely professional. Casey also recognizes that she is falling for him,\\"Chuck Versus the Imported Hard Salami\\" something he teases her and Chuck about frequently. The development of a relationship between Sarah and Chuck meets with two major sets of obstacles throughout the series. First, professionally Sarah is supposed to avoid romantic entanglements, and her affection for Chuck sometimes does put him in danger.\\"Chuck Versus the Break-Up\\" Second, both characters become jealous of competing romantic interests, including instances where one of them has to seduce someone for a mission. There are two particularly notable cases of these love triangles in the first season. Chuck's interest in finding a real relationship leads Chuck to \\"break up\\" his cover relationship with Sarah and pursue Lou the sandwich girl,\\"Chuck Versus the Truth\\" which causes Sarah to become jealous and protective. Just after the \\"break up\\" Sarah passionately kisses Chuck seconds before a bomb is meant to explode. Soon afterwards, Bryce Larkin returns\\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" and competes for Sarah's affections. Sarah is torn but ultimately decides to stick with her mission protecting Chuck rather than follow Bryce, largely due to her feelings for Chuck. By the end of the season, Sarah displays a willingness to go to great lengths for Chuck, and is even prepared to go rogue and draw her gun on another CIA agent attempting to take him into government custody.\\"Chuck Versus the Marlin\\" =Season 2= In the second season, Chuck and Sarah haltingly move towards establishing a real relationship. Sarah agrees to go on a first \\"real\\" date with Chuck as it appears he is being released back to civilian life.\\"Chuck Versus the First Date\\" However, the rebuilt Intersect is sabotaged, pulling Chuck back into his spy life and re-establishing Sarah's professional barrier. Then, as Chuck attempts to pursue Sarah anyway, Larkin returns a second time.\\"Chuck Versus the Seduction\\" This time Sarah's feelings are clearly for Chuck, but when her affection for Chuck places both her life and Chuck's at risk, Bryce convinces Chuck to \\"break up\\" with her. Shortly thereafter, Chuck runs into his ex-girlfriend Jill Roberts, creating another love triangle that makes Sarah jealous and protective of Chuck. But this time she shows more restraint, trying not to interfere, at least until she discovers Jill is a member of Fulcrum.\\"Chuck Versus the Ex\\" Yet another love triangle arises later in the season with the arrival of Cole Barker, who (like Bryce) is a suave and formidable spy, but that only goes as far as a kiss. Chuck provides Sarah with emotional support when a mission forces her to revisit part of her childhood, and later when Sarah's father returns. Chuck makes some strong suggestions that he loves Sarah, including notably in the mid-season finale when he gives Sarah his mother's charm bracelet, a gift Sarah says is something he should save for a \\"real girlfriend.\\" Sarah's personal feelings for Chuck lead to her temporary replacement as Chuck's handler in \\"Chuck Versus the Broken Heart\\", as Beckman is concerned those feelings jeopardized the mission. However, the replacement agent, Forrest (Tricia Helfer), failed to effectively protect Chuck and he refused to work with her because of her methods. Sarah's feelings also gave her a close insight that warned her something was wrong when Forrest couldn't. Beckman reluctantly acknowledged Sarah and Chuck's feelings for each other were actually a benefit to their working relationship rather than a danger and allowed Sarah to resume her role as his handler. In the meantime, while Sarah's professional obligations to Chuck are suspended, she becomes more personally involved. Sarah makes an unauthorized and illegal search of the CIA database at Langley to locate Chuck's father after his own efforts fail, and ultimately she takes Chuck to meet his father. In \\"Chuck Versus the First Kill\\" General Beckman orders Sarah to lure Chuck to Castle so he can be taken into custody and brought back to Washington. Sarah objects, but is about to carry out her orders when at the last minute she warns Chuck that it is a setup and takes him on the run.\\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\" While on the run, Chuck and Sarah spend the night in a motel and share a bed. While not under surveillance, they kiss and are close to having sex but are interrupted by a lack of a condom, followed by the appearance of Agent Casey. After Chuck successfully removes the Intersect from his head, Sarah is reassigned to work on the new Intersect project with Bryce, but soon decides not to go and instead stay with Chuck. But even after learning that she turned down the assignment, Chuck consciously re-establishes the professional barrier by uploading the new Intersect. =Season 3= By the beginning of \\"Chuck Versus the Pink Slip\\" Sarah's relationship with Chuck is shattered. Flashbacks throughout the episode reveal that shortly after uploading the new Intersect, Sarah asked Chuck to go AWOL and run away with her so they could be together. Chuck was initially enthusiastic, but by the time they met with each other, he refused so he could pursue his spy training. Sarah was heartbroken and subsequently cut him off. She was forced to reconnect again when Chuck interfered with an operation against the Ring. Ultimately, Chuck was reinstated on the team and Sarah was ordered by Beckman to help train Chuck. Their relationship issues again came to a head during an assignment with Carina. Because of Chuck's remaining feelings for her, she requested a transfer from Beckman on grounds that she was a liability but was denied. They managed to partially resolve their situation, and Carina showed Sarah security footage of Chuck trying to explain to her that he chose to take his spy training because of Sarah's own encouragement, and his realization that he could help people and a desire to protect those he loved-including her. Team Bartowski's new leader, Daniel Shaw, began romantically approaching Sarah in \\"Chuck Versus the Mask.\\" Although initially Sarah very vocally rejected his advances, when she and Shaw were exposed to cyclosarin gas Sarah admitted that she overreacted and somewhat enjoyed Shaw's attention. Sarah and Chuck agreed that they were free to pursue relationships with other people, and Sarah began allowing Shaw to get closer. In \\"Chuck Versus the Fake Name\\", Sarah tells Shaw that this job is making her slowly forget who she was before and says that for the last three years, she has never once told anybody her real name. When Shaw asks her what it is, Sarah reveals that her real name is Sam (most likely from Samantha). Chuck also finds out her real name after he overhears this conversation while posing as an assassin the Ring hired to kill Shaw. She is still initially reluctant to allow herself to become involved with him, but by the end of the episode relents. Sarah administered Chuck's \\"final exam\\" as a spy alongside Shaw in \\"Chuck Versus the Final Exam.\\" During the mission, Chuck tried to talk about what happened in Prague, but the mission interrupted them. Although pleased with Chuck's successful handling of the assignment, Sarah was greatly disturbed when Shaw instructed her to order him to kill a rogue CIA agent. She attempted to resist, fearing what it would make Chuck into, but eventually gave Chuck his instructions. When Chuck finally cornered his target he hesitated and Casey completed the hit from the shadows, however from Sarah's perspective it looked like Chuck pulled the trigger. After the mission, she refused to answer when he attempted to call and expressed to Shaw her distaste over what she had turned Chuck into. When Shaw pressed if she was still in love with Chuck, she replied she no longer was. In \\"Chuck Versus the American Hero\\" Chuck presses her on how he feels and asks for a second chance at Prague. Sarah is in the process of packing to meet him when Casey arrives. Although she insists what he has to tell her won't change her decision, Casey admits he killed the mole instead, to Sarah's visible relief thus removing any reservations that Sarah had against Chuck. However, before she can leave, Shaw arrives and tells her they have a new mission and there is no time to contact Chuck. In Shaw's car, Sarah is distressed that there is no signal to call Chuck and asks where they are headed. Shaw tells her only they are going to \\"settle an old score.\\" \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy\\" revealed that Sarah was taken by Shaw to a Ring facility, where masquerading that they were still on a mission, he revealed to Sarah that she was set up to kill Evelyn. Despite the revelation, Sarah continued to trust Shaw over Chuck's misgivings. She and Chuck did reconcile their feelings for each other, as she admits she fell for him before the climax of the Season 1 pilot. As they were preparing to begin a relationship, Shaw lured her to Paris and took her to the street where Evelyn was killed, revealing that he had turned to the Ring and intended to kill Sarah in retaliation for his wife's death. Chuck correctly guessed Shaw's intent and destination and arrived in time to save Sarah's life by shooting Shaw when he refused to back down. Unlike the death of Perry, Chuck's killing of Shaw to save her life (and his handling of the situation as a whole) put Sarah's mind at ease, realizing that although Chuck is capable of killing someone, he won't resort to that until every other option has been exhausted. The two chose to spend a few days together in Paris before returning to Burbank. She and Chuck did attempt to run away from the spy life together in \\"Chuck Versus the Honeymooners\\" until an encounter with a defecting Basque terrorist helped them realize that they \\"wanted it all,\\" and were determined to build their relationship without giving up on their careers. Although Beckman was not pleased when she learned of the couple, even she noted: \\"It's about damn time.\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Role Models\\", Chuck asks her to move in but she initially declines, telling him that they aren't a \\"normal couple\\" so they shouldn't pretend to have a \\"normal life.\\" General Beckman assigns them to observe an experienced spy couple, the Turners. After seeing the Turners' rocky relationship, Chuck and Sarah find that their relationship could be more of a challenge than they thought. However, Sarah agrees to move in with Chuck at the end of the episode, so that they can have something \\"to fall back on after [their] spy life is over.\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Tooth\\" even though they are living together, Sarah still has difficulty expressing her emotions to Chuck. When Chuck starts to show signs of a mental breakdown and is locked down in a CIA mental hospital, Sarah believes in and supports his claims that a Zamibian scientist has connections to the Ring. Although her investigation indicates that Chuck is wrong, she goes to his doctor and tells him that she loves Chuck and wants to help him work through whatever problems he is facing. At the end of the episode, she candidly tells Chuck that she loves him. Sarah struggles with Chuck lying to her in \\"Chuck Versus the Living Dead\\" about his dream that Shaw is alive. After she obtains the truth from Morgan, she confronts Chuck and along with Casey, goes through her relationship with Shaw to find any clues as to his whereabouts or plans. She breaks into Shaw's penthouse with Chuck and recovers Shaw's Intelligence Safe after a confrontation with a Ring agent. When Chuck's father leaves, she provides Chuck with his address and takes him to Stephen's cabin, where she saves Chuck from a trap by Ring agents. At the end of the episode, Sarah gives her spy will to Chuck, saying that he's the only one she wants to have it in case something happens to her. In \\"Chuck Versus the Subway\\", Sarah, along with Casey and Chuck, is arrested by Shaw under charges of treason after Shaw puts in motion his plan to take over the CIA. While supposedly transporting them to a detention facility, Shaw stops the truck and tells them to uncuff themselves, planning on killing them and making it look as if they were trying to escape, at which point Morgan and Devon use Casey's highly modified Crown Victoria to blow up the truck, rescuing Team Bartowski. In \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\", Sarah and Team Bartowski carry out a plan to expose Shaw at a security convention. The plan succeeds and they're able to identify and detain the Ring Elders, but Shaw manages to escape just as Sarah walks into his office to find Chuck heavily debilitated by his latest attempt at flashing without the Governor. Sarah takes a barely conscious Chuck back to Castle when Shaw enters the Buy More and plants several bombs, threatening to blow up the store unless Chuck meets him. Sarah leaves Chuck in Castle and meets Shaw alone just as Jeff, Lester and Big Mike pull the fire alarm, emptying out the store, although Shaw is able to prevent Sarah from escaping. Chuck sees through the monitors in Castle that Shaw is holding Sarah hostage at the Buy More and manages to get up and meet him. After their confrontation, Chuck decides not to kill Shaw and Sarah knocks him unconscious, taking the Governor from him and returning it to Chuck. She later accepts Chuck's decision to follow through on his promise to Ellie and quit the CIA. =Season 4= At the beginning of the fourth season, Sarah continues working for the CIA partnered with Casey, while Chuck is retired. \\"Chuck Versus the Anniversary\\" reveals that the two have been assigned to investigate Volkoff Industries, run by a notorious black-market arms dealer. Their mission dovetails with Chuck's own search for his mother, which she and Casey agree to aid. Most of Sarah's actions for the remainder of the season revolve around this combined mission and around the personal challenges from her past that she confronts as she and Chuck decide to commit to marriage. Sarah confronts her old high school enemy Heather Chandler again in \\"Chuck Versus the Cubic Z.\\" Heather admits that she tried the route that Sarah is currently traveling (with Chuck being her personal moral beacon), but her nature overwhelmed any inclination at a normal life; she further doubts that Sarah will be any different. Under fire, Sarah denies being anything like Heather; the two come to an understanding and as a peace offering, Heather surrenders what she knows about Project Beacon and Frost (Chuck's mother). In Chuck Versus Phase Three, after Chuck is captured, Sarah goes on a rogue mission to find him, during the course of which Casey describes her actions as those of Langston Graham's \\"wild card enforcer,\\" a side of her he didn't like. Sarah ultimately agrees with Casey's statement and says \\"I'm different without Chuck, and I don't like it.\\" When she finally finds him, Sarah resolves her expressed fear of marriage in multiple previous episodes by telling an unconscious Chuck that she loves him and wants to spend the rest of her life with him, with or without the Intersect. Sarah tells Beckman in \\"Chuck Versus the Balcony\\" that if there is anything she can do to bring back Chuck's mother to let her do so. Just as Chuck is about to propose to her, she is pulled away to establish her cover as a rogue CIA agent and goes undercover in Volkoff Industries to help Mary bring it down. After Alexei Volkoff is defeated, Chuck finally proposes to Sarah while waiting for the arrival of Clara Woodcomb. The pending wedding with Chuck presents Sarah with a number of personal hurdles owing to her childhood. In \\"Chuck Versus the Seduction Impossible\\" Chuck's family starts prying the couple with questions about their wedding plans causing Sarah to panic. She suggests eloping, as she would have no one to invite to the large family wedding Chuck desired. To help her reconnect with her friends, Chuck reunites Sarah with her old team, in \\"Chuck Versus the Cat Squad\\", prompting the return of their nemesis Augusto Gaez and some internal grudges. Sarah had long suspected her teammate Zondra of being a traitor working with Gaez, having found a transmitter in her boot. When it was discovered that Amy was, in fact, the traitor, Sarah mended her friendship with Zondra, inviting her and Carina to be her bridesmaids. Sarah also deepens friendship with Ellie, agreeing to discuss her family issues, and inviting her to be maid of honor. In \\"Chuck Versus the First Bank of Evil\\", Sarah is at first not truly excited about making wedding plans but Ellie explains that a portion will cause her to make the situation more real, alluding to her own factor in her and Devon's wedding: their wedding rings. Sarah is doubtful, but when she tries to find the right dress, Ellie's prediction is justified. At the end of the episode, Sarah has become a Bridezilla, horrifying both Ellie and Chuck. Sarah reconnects with her father, \\"Jack Burton,\\" in \\"Chuck Versus the Wedding Planner\\" when the wedding planner she hires with Chuck steals their savings. She fails to conceal her upcoming wedding from him, and ultimately Jack and Sarah have a father/daughter dance at the reception. Jack laments it might be the only one they have. Chuck invites Jack to stick around but he says he won't make promises to Sarah he can't keep. Instead, Jack leaves Sarah her old piggy bank to which he has only added cash, never taken, to cover the costs of their wedding. In \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details\\", Vivian discovers that Chuck's mother and father were responsible for the undoing of her own father, Alexi Volkoff/Hartley Winterbottom. She takes her revenge by targeting Sarah with the Norseman device. Sarah is barely clinging to life throughout most of \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\", but is saved when Chuck and Hartley retrieve the antidote for the Norseman from Vivian. She and Chuck are then finally married. When they return from their honeymoon two weeks later she and Chuck reveal to Casey and Morgan that Hartley turned over all the wealth of Volkoff Industries to them. She and Chuck used this money to purchase the Buy More and Castle and announce they intend to go into business for themselves as independent spies. =Season 5= Sarah's devotion to the spy life wanes, subtly at first, but much more pronounced in later episodes. Her decisions become more geared towards using her emotions and believing in her friends rather than relying on distrust, suspicion, and self-sufficiency. The start of this mindset began most notably in \\"Chuck Versus the Frosted Tips\\", when she believed (correctly) that Morgan's drastic change in attitude was due more to a malfunctioning Intersect than a power trip, even when Chuck believed that Morgan was simply acting like an overconfident ass. She further displays a dislike for her spy life when she asks Chuck not to get reintegrated with the CIA. This dislike proceeds further as she suggests that Carmichael Industries become an Electronic Security Company, focusing on Chuck's primary strength with computers, and minimizing the amount of gunplay they would be subjected to in \\"Chuck Versus Bo\\". However, Nicholas Quinn's emergence and the reintroduction of the Intersect glasses lead to the team having a \\"last mission\\", which was successful, though Quinn kidnaps Chuck in exchange for the glasses. Sarah and Casey go to save him but are ambushed by Quinn's men and heavily outnumbered. Sarah, after running out of ammunition, puts on the glasses and uploads the Intersect into her head, which allows her to save both her and Casey after she flashes on how to neutralize Quinn's men and go to rescue Chuck, but Sarah begins to suffer uncontrollable flashes shortly after. She's kidnapped by Quinn after he realizes that she has the Intersect and forces her to flash on Intersect images, wiping her memories, including those of her relationship with Chuck. He then manipulates Sarah into believing that he's her CIA handler and that she has orders to bring him the Intersect glasses and kill Chuck. Sarah is able to get the glasses, but Chuck had managed to switch them. Sarah then takes Ellie hostage as leverage against Chuck and Chuck agrees to give her to the glasses and Sarah threatens to kill Ellie if she senses that it's a trap. As they drive to where Chuck hid the glasses, Ellie notices that Sarah isn't wearing her seatbelt and tells her that if she had her memories back, she would want her to do whatever needed to protect Chuck and then crashes her car, which knocks Sarah out. Chuck then tells Ellie that he knows where to take Sarah to help her get her memories back. Sarah awakens in the house she and Chuck had planned to buy and Chuck tells her that he brought her there hoping that she'd remember the house, if not him. Sarah tells him that their relationship was nothing more than a cover and he was just an assignment. Chuck tells her that he was an assignment, but then that she fell in love with him. With tears in his eyes, he tells her about their first real, non-cover kiss was when they thought they were going to die from a bomb and how he closed his eyes and felt her grab him and then kiss him and how they tried to pretend it never happened and how one day he was so sure that she could never love a nerd like him, she came over and he asked if she loved him and that she said yes. Chuck then tells her that when he proposed, they knew they would be together for the rest of their lives, living in this house and raising a family. Chuck then tells Sarah that he's going to give her a choice: they can start over or she can take the glasses and never see him again. Sarah then asks if Chuck really loves her to which he replies \\"With all of my heart.\\" Sarah then tells Chuck she's sorry for doing her job too well and that she's going to finish the mission. As she tries to grab the glasses, Chuck grabs them away for her and they get into a scuffle, with Chuck refusing to fight back. She then kicks him down the steps and takes the glasses and then points her gun at his head. Chuck tells her that she can kill him, but that he'll never hurt her. Sarah then notices the carving of their names and remembers writing it. At that moment, Quinn arrives and takes the glasses and tells Sarah that Chuck was right about him and pulls out a gun to shoot her with. Chuck then jumps in front of the bullet and is shot in the back. Sarah tries to shoot Quinn, but he escapes. She then kneels down next to Chuck to see if he's okay and he tells her that he's wearing a vest. Hearing the sirens, Chuck tells her that the CIA is coming for her and tells her to run and she flees. Back at her place, Sarah is quickly packing her things when Casey walks through the door. She pulls a knife, but Casey tells her that he's not there to fight. He asks what she remembers about him to which Sarah replies his reputation: how he's unfriendly, unforgiving and unquestioning about orders. Casey chuckles and says that people said the same thing about her when they first met and says that it was probably the reason they never got along. Sarah asks if they didn't along, why he was here now and Casey pulls out an envelope out of his jacket and sets it down for her, saying that Chuck ended up making them both soft. He tells her that in the past five years, the two of them changed and they became friends. Casey tells Sarah to take care of herself and then leaves. Sarah then opens the envelope he left and pulls out a disc of mission logs. She watches them and it's of her telling how she's started to fall in love with Chuck and even one confirming the kiss Chuck had told her about. Sarah then shows up at Chuck's apartment just as he's about to go inside. Sarah tells him that she believes everything he said about them, but that she doesn't feel it. Chuck asks her why she's there right now and Sarah tells him that she wanted to say she was sorry for everything that happened and that she wanted to say goodbye. She tells Chuck that she's going to go look for Quinn. The two of them say goodbye and then Sarah leaves. Sarah then started pursuing Quinn, learning that he's trying to reassemble The Key, a device that can modify the Intersect's original function. When she fails to stop him on a plane, she returns to Chuck to ask for his help. They track Quinn to Berlin, where by coincidence, she started re-enacting the events from the pilot. However, she made the mistake of assuming that Chuck would kill Quinn, who not only allowed Quinn to escape but accidentally shot down Casey's helicopter in the process. Locked back in Castle, Sarah was convinced to work with the team as they tried to stop Quinn. Sarah is forced to shoot Quinn when he reaches for his gun, ruining their chances of deactivating the bomb Beckman is sitting on. Chuck then decides that he must upload the Intersect back into his head in order to figure out how to defuse the bomb, thus eliminating the only chance of Sarah getting her memories back. He gets the Intersect, but cannot figure out to disarm the bomb once he's on the computer for it. Sarah suggests searching for \\"Irene Demova\\" (a porn virus) on the Internet which Chuck does and is surprised that she knows about, pointing out it was from five years ago and the bomb is disarmed after the virus crashes it Afterward, Sarah felt unsure of herself because her memories have still not fully returned and tells Chuck that she needs time alone to figure out who she is. Chuck later finds her on the beach, pointing out that it was the same beach they were at after their first \\"date\\" when Sarah told him to trust her and that he's doing the same thing now, asking her to trust him. He tells Sarah that no matter where she goes, he'll always be there for her. Sarah asks Chuck to tell her about their story, to which he does. When he has finished, Chuck suggests that they try Morgan's theory and have a \\"magical kiss\\" to see if her memories will return. Sarah tells Chuck to kiss her. They share a kiss, thus; ending the series. Whether it means that Sarah's memories will come back or she will have to fall in love with Chuck all over again remains unknown. Development On February 12, 2007 Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski was announcedDevelopment Update: Monday, February 12, The Futon Critic for what was then the role of \\"Sarah Kent,\\" joining Zachary Levi (Chuck) and Adam Baldwin (Maj. John Casey). Prior to the beginning of filming the character's name was changed to Sarah Walker. Strahovski was unable to come to the US for an audition so the producers allowed her to make her audition via the internet.Interview: January 23, 2008, YvonneStrahovski.net The character is a reversal of typical action film gender roles, with Sarah Walker portraying the protector and fighter while Chuck is the more emotional \\"brain.\\" Strahovski herself is highly active and performs all her own fight scenes. She considers this one of her favorite parts of the role, especially the fight scene in \\"Chuck Versus the First Date\\" against Michael Clarke Duncan's towering Mr. Colt.Interview: October 8, 2007, BuddyTV.com She also speaks fluent Polish, which she worked into the role in the Season One episode \\"Chuck Versus the Wookiee.\\" Very little of Sarah's background is revealed in Season 1 other than her relationship with Bryce Larkin and middle name. However real attention was paid to her past in the first half of Season Two. In June 2008 Nicole Richie was announced to be appearing in a role as a former classmate of Sarah from high school,Cast Update: June 26, 2008, TV Decoder and in September Gary Cole was revealed to be playing Sarah's father in an upcoming episode.Cast Update: September 10, 2008, IGN.com It has not been announced if the name Graham hints at on her birth certificate is actually her real name, or if it will ever be revealed. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak revealed that Sarah's mission would shift somewhat in Season 3. According to dialogue quoted during interviews, Sarah's role would begin to change from protecting Chuck from the world to protecting the world from Chuck due to the unpredictability of Intersect 2.0. Sarah would also have a significant effect on Chuck's development during the third season, due to the profound impact she has on his emotional state. As described by Fedak, with the Intersect being affected by Chuck's emotions, Sarah has the potential to be both his \\"kryptonite\\" and his \\"spinach.\\"Chicago Tribune: July 26, 2009: Chuck vs. Season 3: What's coming next on the spy dramedy Other interviews and panels have indicated Sarah's role with Chuck would also change from more of an asset/handler relationship, to becoming Chuck's \\"sensei.\\"Blast: Comic- Con 09: Chris Fedak, co-creator of Chuck =Personality= At the beginning of the series, Sarah's complicated upbringing and government training have made her deadly, determined and guarded. * Her childhood experience in conning and concealing secrets has been sharpened by spy training; she is highly capable at combat, especially with throwing knives (she typically wears several in a sheath strapped to her leg when her wardrobe allows,) and to a lesser extent her favored side arm throughout the series, the Smith & Wesson Model 5906; she is able to speak in several foreign languages (Polish,\\"Chuck Versus the Honeymooners\\" Russian, Spanish\\"Chuck Versus the Undercover Lover\\" and German,\\"Chuck Versus the Sandworm\\" and can understand at least some Swedish) and accents. * Before she meets Chuck she is apparently, in Casey's words, \\"Langston Graham's wild-card enforcer,\\" and in her own words in \\"Chuck Versus the Tooth\\", does not envision a future for herself beyond her next mission. She is determined to personally resolve Bryce's perceived personal and professional betrayal. * And finally, her professional need to keep her past and emotions a closely guarded secret also suits her temperamentally. She does not readily discuss her personal history or reveal her real name, and repeatedly states the conventional wisdom of the spy community that emotion and love create vulnerabilities. It is later revealed that a key event in her becoming cold and distant was the day of her \\"red test,\\" or first kill, which she considers to be the worst day of her life and the details of which she never forgot; and one of her greatest stated fears is Chuck becoming like her when he is ordered to undergo his own red test.\\"Chuck Versus the Final Exam\\" Still, she is immediately receptive to Chuck's good nature and humor, and she much later admits to Chuck that she fell for him during the first episode \\"after you fixed my phone and before you started defusing bombs with computer viruses.\\"\\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy\\" While Sarah lacks Chuck's openly trusting nature, she quickly recognizes that Chuck is just a regular guy and not a threat, and chooses to protect him from the NSA team led by John Casey. A series-long character arc involves her gradually overcoming both professional barriers and deep-rooted relationship baggage from her past to let her guard down and develop a relationship with Chuck. The first two seasons show her to be much more empathetic and sympathetic to Chuck's plight than Casey, and is highly protective of Chuck, to an extent beyond the requirements of her mission to safeguard the Intersect. Where Casey for a long time only seems concerned with physical threats to Chuck's safety (things that might cost the government the use of the Intersect information in Chuck's head), Sarah is more concerned for him as an individual: * Sarah is quick to reassure Chuck of his own abilities beyond the Intersect, and tells him on several occasions that he has made an excellent spy. * Sarah openly warned both Lou and Jill\\"Chuck Versus the Fat Lady\\"‚Äîwith whom Chuck carried on brief relationships‚Äînot to hurt him. * By the end of the first season, she is prepared to pull a gun on a fellow CIA agent rather than allow Chuck to be detained for the rest of his life. Later, in \\"Chuck Versus Santa Claus\\", she executes an unarmed Fulcrum agent, since his special status makes him confident that Fulcrum will find him and that he would then reveal to them that Chuck is the Intersect, and thereafter Chuck's life would be over. * Early on, she objects to orders that put Chuck and those close to him in danger; she also increasingly objects to lying or concealing information from Chuck and using him without his knowledge. Chuck and Sarah have always had a saying 'Don't freak out'. Though she kisses Chuck when they think they're about to die, and they go on a real date when they think Chuck is about to regain his freedom, Sarah keeps Chuck uncertain about her feelings for him with mixed messages: obvious concern for Chuck, the ambiguous nature of their \\"cover relationship,\\" noting professional barriers to any real relationship but also occasionally holding out the possibility of eventually having a normal life with her, and her aptitude for taking on different roles/covers and using her appearance on missions, at times flirting with the team's targets when needed.\\"Chuck Versus the Crown Vic\\"\\"Chuck Versus the Third Dimension\\" Further complicating things on both sides are the occasional love triangles. Despite her attempts to mask her feelings, many characters in the first two seasons, including Chuck's sister Ellie,\\"Chuck Versus the Tango\\" Bryce Larkin, Casey, Carina, Roan Montgomery, and her father, all detect that she is romantically interested in or in love with Chuck. Though she denies any such interest, she openly acknowledges a desire to remain friendly with Chuck on a personal level, until the end of the second season, when she and Chuck share several intimate moments. At this time, as Chuck becomes more capable in combat and embraces becoming a spy, she becomes more concerned about how this will change his character, and that if he has to kill he will lose the trusting and good nature she originally came to love about him, just as she thinks her own \\"red test\\" changed her. In \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\", Shaw remarks on how Sarah's personality has transformed from a person who masked her emotions to being just as open, caring and loving as Chuck. She does express relief when Chuck does not kill Shaw after defeating him and shows mercy. While Shaw said that it made him weak, Sarah tells Chuck, \\"No, that is what makes you great!\\" Several episodes imply that Sarah misses or envies the \\"normal\\" life Chuck desires to return to. Sarah herself expressed a desire to have a normal life with Chuck in \\"Chuck Versus the Pink Slip,\\" and has asked Carina\\"Chuck Versus the Three Words\\" and Casey if they ever wondered what a normal, real life would be like. In \\"Chuck Versus the Role Models\\", Sarah moved in with Chuck and expressed that she looked forward to living a \\"normal life\\" with him after their spy lives are over. But in keeping with her temperament, Sarah is often unnerved in situations of a more domestic nature. She is visibly flustered as Ellie's maid of honor, and in a deleted scene from \\"Chuck Versus the Ring,\\" is panicking, stating that she handled covert operations and none of it was as terrifying as Ellie on her wedding day. When Devon suggests that Chuck and Sarah would be next in line for the family life, Sarah becomes scared; she later channels her frustration and fear by pummelling Casey in a sparring match, and becomes instantly relieved when a romantic mission is cancelled. After Clara's birth and Chuck's proposal when Chuck's family begin to plan Chuck and Sarah's wedding, Chuck, Casey and Sarah become visibly scared at the family's intensity; Sarah remarks that she's \\"sweating. The last time [she] sweat, gunfire was involved.\\" Throughout the rest of Season 4, Sarah becomes more accepting of the concept of marriage and normalcy and ultimately Chuck and Sarah are married by the end of Season 4. Season 5 has Sarah become more interested in having a normal life, to the point of admitting she was excited about the possibility of having a baby, which prompts her to start questioning the constant risks she and Chuck put themselves through in their line of work. Her change from a cold-blooded spy to a warm and loving person culminates with her reconnecting with her mother, to Chuck's excitement.

He served as the first \\"Dewan\\" (Prime Minister) of the erstwhile Baroda state, and Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1966. Early life left Jivraj Narayan Mehta was born on 29 August 1887 to Narayan and Jamakben Mehta in Amreli in Bombay Presidency. He was son-in-law of Manubhai Mehta, then Dewan of Baroda state. In his early age, Dr. Eduljee Rustomji Dadachandjee, a civil surgeon in Amreli prompted him to take up medicine. He subsequently secured admission into the Grant Medical College and Sir J. J. Hospital, Bombay, after clearing a stiff written test and a thorough viva voce examination that was conducted by the British IMS officers. Mehta's medical education was sponsored by the Seth VM Kapol Boarding Trust. He topped the class in his First Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery(equivalent of MBBS) examination. In his final year, he won seven of the eight prizes open to his batch and shared the eighth prize with his hostel roommate Kashinath Dikshit. Later, for postgraduate studies in London he applied to the Tata education foundation for a student loan and he was selected as one of the only two students for this prestigious fellowship from amongst several bright students who had applied for it. Jivraj Mehta lived from 1909 to 1915 in London. He was the president of the Indian Students Association in London where he studied medicine and did his FRCS there. He won University gold medal in his MD examinations in 1914. Later, he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London. Political career =Doctor of Mahatma Gandhi= He was briefly the personal doctor to Mahatma Gandhi after returning to India and joined the independence movement. He was twice incarcerated (1938 and 1942) by the British government for his role in Gandhi's Satyagraha movement. After independence in 1947, he held various public offices. He served as the first \\"Dewan\\" (Prime Minister) of the erstwhile Baroda state in free India sworn-in on 4 September 1948, director general of health services and secretary to the ministry of health in the central government during the partition period, minister of public works, finance, industry and prohibition for the then Bombay state. =Chief Minister= He was the first Chief Minister of the newly formed Gujarat state from April 1960 to September 1963. Later he also served as the Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1966. Contributions to medical education in India He was the founder of Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College and King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. He served in these institutions as their first Dean over a period of 17 years (1925‚Äì42). In the 1930s, Mehta had gauged the fundamental importance of research in medical education. As the dean, he made many efforts towards securing adequate funds for the institute. is enterprise. Drs. P. C. Bharucha, M. D. D. Gilder, N. A. Purandare and R. N. Cooper responded overwhelmingly to his appeal for financial donations to the college research corpus. However, similar requests to the Indian Research Fund Association went for nothing. Then Dr. Jivraj persuaded Sir Walter Morley Fletcher to visit KEM Hospital on his visit to Bombay to attend a dinner. He shown him the commendable research going on and also impressed upon Sir Walter the acute need of Government support for such a research program. The result was Government sanction of funds within a few weeks for the same projects through the Indian Research Fund Association. Mehta with other medical personalities like Nilratan Sarkar and Dr. B. C. Roy strongly forwarded the case of the metropolitan city of Delhi, when the Government was contemplating establishment of a central medical research institute at Dehradun. Their proposal was accepted by the government and result was All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Delhi. He was also involved in the planning of the medical colleges and hospitals at Poona (now Pune), Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Aurangabad. In the establishment of the Topiwala Nair Municipal Hospital, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Hospital and the Dr. Balabai Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai, he played a key role. He was thrice elected president of the All India Medical Congress and also president of the Indian Medical Association. Mehta died on 7 November 1978. His marriage to Hansabhan in the 1920s provoked what historian John R. Wood describes as a \\"mild sensation\\" because it was an inter-caste union, with Mehta being of the Bania community and his wife coming from a prominent Nagar Brahmin family.

The commission was established as a response to criticism from the public and government over media ownership. As the Commission chair, Hutchins had the duty of selecting members for the Commission, but he ran his picks by Henry Luce first. The final commission was made up of twelve prominent intellectuals. Although all members were respected intellectuals with sterling reputations, none were journalists. Hutchins thought the commission would be more open-minded if it contained no journalists, but enemies of the Commission, particularly in the press, used that to attack its credentials. After deliberating for four years, the Commission came to this conclusion in 1947: the press plays an important role in the development and stability of modern society and, as such, it is imperative that a commitment of social responsibility be imposed on mass media. According to this social responsibility theory, the press has a moral obligation to consider the overall needs of society when making journalistic decisions in order to produce the greatest good. Though there had been journalism \\"codes of ethics\\" for decades, the Commission's report was considered landmark by some scholars; they believed it was a pivotal reassertion of modern media's role in a democratic society. Social- responsibility theory was born at a time (just after Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs death) when large and powerful publishers were unpopular with the public, and when the public had a high degree of suspicions about the motivations and objectives of the press. The press had mushroomed into an unwieldy and powerful entity, and criticism of the Fourth Estate was widespread. Critics contended that the media had monopolistic tendencies, that corporate owners were not concerned with the rights or interests of those unlike themselves, and that commercialization produced a debased culture as well as dangerously selfish politics. Social-responsibility theory thus proposes that the media take it upon themselves to elevate society's standards, providing citizens with the information they need to govern themselves. It is in the best interest of the media to do this; if they do not, social theorists warn, the public will demand that the government regulate the media. Some scholars (among them John C. Nerone) have speculated whether journalistic fairness and balance already existed prior to the Commission‚Äôs report. Were the Commission's conclusions merely an \\"adjustment\\" in liberalism, brought on by perceived business demands? Libertarians (who prioritize individual liberty and seek to minimize the power of the state) are wary of the social- responsibility theory; they believe that responsibility means accountability, accountability means government intervention, and government intervention comes at the expense of liberty. Indeed, the Commission noted that continued misuse of press power would necessitate regulation. References  Sources  * John C.

Beckman describes herself as a documentary photographer. While she produces a lot of work on location (such as the cover of The Police album Zenyatta Mondatta, taken in the middle of a forest in the Netherlands), she is also a studio portrait photographer. Her work has appeared on records for the major labels, and in magazines including Esquire, Rolling Stone, Glamour, Italian Vogue, The Times, Newsweek, Jalouse, Mojo and others. Early life Beckman was at King Alfred School, in Golders Green in north London, from 1953 to 1967.OA News & Correspondence. Alfredians. Accessed January 2018. She spent a year at Saint Martin's School of Art, and then three years at London College of Communication studying photography.  Punk and hip-hop photography  After initially working for Sounds magazine with Vivien Goldman ‚Äì her first shoot was with Siouxsie and the Banshees ‚Äì she had a job shooting for music magazines such as Melody Maker and The Face, with a studio and darkroom in central London. Her primary focus was the UK's burgeoning punk subculture. Beckman moved permanently to New York City in 1982 and continued her career, shooting for her UK clients as well as new ones in the U.S. After moving to New York, Beckman presented her portfolio to American record companies looking for work shooting album covers, but the gritty feel of her work did not fit the \\"airbrushed\\" aesthetic preferred at the time. She was passed on to smaller rap and hip-hop labels, where she photographed acts such as Salt-N-Pepa, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and the Beastie Boys in their early days. In a 2015 interview with American Photo magazine, she recalled \\"It is amazing, 30 years later, people going ‚Äòoh you photographed legends.‚Äô I guess I did, but they weren‚Äôt legends when I was taking pictures of them.‚Äù  Exhibitions  In August 2010 Beckman produced an exhibition entitled Archive of Attitude at Arkitip's Project Space, Los Angeles, which included \\"works from her time in London during the punk era through the hip-hop decade in New York and Los Angeles\\". Arkitip published a supplement to the show in the form of a broadsheet newspaper full of Beckman's photographs. That same month photographer Jill Furmanovsky chose Beckman's Paul Weller and Pete Townsend as one of her personal favourite music photographs for an article with NME. In March 2011 the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York City opened an exhibition at their Bowery location titled Catch the Beat: The Roots of Punk and Hip Hop, a joint exhibition of photographs by Beckman and photographer David Corio. In a recording of Beckman working on the streets of Harlem, her photograph of LL Cool J with his boom box is described as hip-hop history, known around the world. In July 2011, Flavorwire named Beckman one of \\"10 Rock Photographers You Should Know\\". In the same month, Beckman launched \\"Archive Of Attitude\\", a blog recounting the stories behind the photographs. In March highlights her current advertising campaign was for Kangol, her third lookbook for the music- friendly headwear company. In the summer of 2012 Beckman joined the faculty at the International Center of Photography in New York City to teach a course on photographing youth culture. Beckman took on a new working relationship with the British style magazine Jocks and Nerds for which she later became the New York City editor. Beckman appeared in the St√ºssy/Yo! MTV Raps two-part documentary \\"We Were All Watching / Part 2, Fashion in the Golden Age of Hip Hop,\\" alongside Bill Adler, Dante Ross, Questlove, and others. A trip to Caracas in 2013 produced a body of work on Tuki dancers, who combine street styles, pop, house and techno culture. Also in 2013, Ono Arte gallery in Bologna held two exhibitions: Made in the UK and My Generation. 2014 brought a residency at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, Nebraska, in conjunction with an exhibition at Carver Savings and Loan Association titled Rebel Culture: Legends of Hip Hop and the Go Hard Boyz (Harlem Bikers). Beckman‚Äôs ‚ÄúHip Hop Mash Up‚Äù was launched in 2014. She teamed up with graffiti artists including Cey Adams, to reinterpret photos from her archive, including Slick Rick, Public Enemy, Run DMC, and Big Daddy Kane. By early 2015 prints had been exhibited at Salon Atelier-Galerie in Paris, France, and at Gansevoort Market, New York City. Later in 2015 comes an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, with photographs by Beckman, including the Mash Up, along with two other New York City photographers, Joe Conzo and Martha Cooper: Hip-Hop Revolution presents more than 80 photographs taken between 1977 and 1990. Also in 2015, Beckman curated an exhibition and slideshow of photographs of musicians from across four decades by dozens of photographers for Photoville, a two week exhibition of photography in Brooklyn, NY. In conjunction with the celebrations in the UK of 40 years since the birth of punk, in 2016, the Punctum Gallery in London‚Äôs Chelsea Art College hosted a punk version of the Mash Up, and shoe store Fiorentini + Baker in east London hosted an exhibition of photos of punks from Beckman‚Äôs archive.

The manor is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England, and its gate piers and wall to the north entrance of the house are listed Grade II. In the early 14th century the lord of the manor was the de Cothay family, whose heir was the Bluett family, later from the early 15th century lords of the manor of Holcombe Rogus in Devon, also of nearby Greenham Barton. The Bluett family lived at Holcombe Court until 1858. Built around 1480, its listing cites it as an unusually well-conserved, neat collection of buildings before 1500 in England The rent for the land surrounding the manor in the medieval era was a pair of silver spurs and a rose. To celebrate the end of the Cousins' Wars, in the Tudor rose iconography of the time, a red rose (for Lancashire), and a white rose (for Yorkshire), were planted on the terrace by Richard Bluett, who was the lord of the manor at the time. In 1927, historian Christopher Hussey wrote in Country Life (magazine) that this manor was \\"the most perfect small 15th‚Äêcentury country house that survives in the Kingdom\\".Visit Somerset: History and Heritage Recent history In 1925, the property was purchased by Lt-Col Reginald Cooper who was Sissinghurst Castle Garden owner Sir Harold Nicolson's oldest friend, having been at school together at Wellington College, Berkshire, in the Diplomatic Corps. They were also were friends of Hidcote Manor Garden's Major Lawrence Johnston and Edwin Lutyens. Cooper arranged for restoration of the gatehouse and the house in a \\"sympathetic\\" manner, to retain the medieval look and feel.Cothay Manor, ‚Äòthe most perfect small 15th-century country house in the kingdom‚Äô, has come up for sale Nicholson's diaries indicate that the gardeners exchanged ideas, and that \\"Reggie came to stay and advised me on the length of the bowling green\\". Cooper's larger projects included moving the River Tone to save his favourite pine trees from erosion. Sissinghurst was laid out in 1932, with one garden writer describing Cothay as the \\"Sissinghurst of the West Country.\\" From 1937 to 1947 the property was owned by Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300‚Äì1500: Volume 3, Southern England Page 529 and housed much of his famous art collection during World War II although it was dispersed after the war. Subsequently, the property was the home of Taunton MP Edward du Cann who sold the property to Alastair and Mary-Anne Robb in 1993. Alastair‚Äôs great- grandmother Mary-Anne was a plant hunter, with the Wood Spurge Euphorbia amygdaloides 'var. robbiae' named after her, nicknamed \\"Mrs Robb's Bonnet\\" because she had to hide it in her hat to smuggle it through customs. With the whole property and gardens in need of renovation, the gardens were gutted and rebuilt along the original Cooper structure. The Robbs also added new garden areas, including a bog garden in the Oxbow, an Arboretum planted, and a wild flower meadow sown. In the 2003 book \\"England‚Äôs Thousand Best Houses\\", Simon Jenkins awarded Cothay four out of five stars \\"for its authentic medieval interiors ‚Äòof incomparable value‚Äô\\".Visitors' Historic Britain: Somerset: Romans to Victorians In 2008 and 2009, the manor was the subject of a Channel 4 television programme presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series. In the first episode, the owners expressed concern about the cost of operating the manor and the ¬£1 million tax bill.Last Night's Television - Country House Rescue Watson provided some advice on increasing the revenue from visitors to the manor and gardens by increasing the commercial appeal.Country House Rescue Revisited Country House Rescue Revisits Cothay In an interview in August 2011, the Robbs said they had accepted some of Watson's advice as they had discussed in the \\"revisited\\" episode (which aired in November 2009) but had also implemented some new concepts of their own with a \\"little bit more soul, spirit and meaning\\".

Service subscribers access queues and or topics to exchange data using point-to-point or publish and subscribe patterns. Goals A message queueing service aims to eliminate the traditional overhead associated with operating in-house messaging infrastructures. These operating overheads include: * Unused capacity installed to meet peak demands * Human resources that are necessary to maintain messaging infrastructure * Projects idle time waiting for resource provisioning * Need to isolate messaging resources Besides reducing cost, a message queueing service seeks to simplify access to messaging resources and therefore facilitate integration efforts within organizations and between them. Benefits A message queueing service also creates new value by providing reduced costs, enhanced performance and reliability. In order to provide those benefits, a message queueing service leverages cloud computing resources such as storage, network, memory and processing capacity. By using virtually unlimited cloud computing resources, a message queueing service provides an internet scale messaging platform. Accessibility A message queueing service is accessible through a variety of protocols such as Java Message Service, AMQP, REST-style APIs and web services. Usage Examples * Patient gets admitted into a hospital out of his provider's network. Producer hospital can start sending real time events about the treatment of the patient to his physician's hospital using a message queueing service platform. The cost of integration between hospitals is marginal since they do not need to configure messaging protocols, VPNs and other details. * Information processing organization that processes events from thousands of different sources, can ask its information providers to simply place messages onto queue services and reduce integration costs. * A Call Centre can carry on servicing requests for bills to be present when the billing system is unavailable * Embedded telemetry devices in vehicles can securely communicate with an application that number crunches statistics in near-real time; Round-robin messaging lets the vehicle supplier add computing resources as his sales increase. * Security trading application can post updates to P&L; application that might be unavailable at the moment. * Technician submits an x-ray while consuming application instances in London, Chicago and S√£o Paulo compete who gets the message first by listening on the same queue.

It is a two-dimensional, 5-neighbor cellular automaton with 6 states per cell, and was developed in 1989 by John Byl, from the Department of Mathematical Sciences of Trinity Western University.  Details  The Byl's loop was developed just a few years after Langton's simplification of Codd's automaton, which produced a simpler automaton that would reproduce itself in 151 time-steps. John Byl simplified Langton's automaton further, with an even smaller automaton that reproduced in just 25 time-steps. Byl's automaton consisted of an array of 12 chips ‚Äî of which 4 or 5 could be counted as the instruction tape ‚Äî and 43 transition rules, while Langton's device consisted of some 10√ó15 chips, including an instruction tape of 33 chips, plus some 190 transition rules.

Built in the weeks following the Union defeat at Bull Run, Fort Worth was situated on a hill north of Hunting Creek, and Cameron Run, (which feeds into it). From its position on one of the highest points west of Alexandria, the fort overlooked the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the Little River Turnpike, and the southern approaches to the city of Alexandria, the largest settlement in Union-occupied Northern Virginia. In modern times, the site of Fort Worth sits within the boundaries the City of Alexandria (the land west of Quaker Lane, was annexed from Fairfax County in the 1950s) just off Seminary Road. Fort Worth Ave, a residential street approximates Fort Worth's Civil War location. It was named for William Jenkins Worth.  Occupation of Alexandria  The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful, with the sole exception of the town of Alexandria. There, as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, commander of the New York Fire Zouaves (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it, he was shot and killed by James Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War.Ames W. Williams, \\"The Occupation of Alexandria,\\" Virginia Cavalcade, Volume 11, (Winter 1961‚Äì62), pp. 33‚Äì34. Throughout the remainder of the war, Alexandria would lean strongly towards the Confederate government, necessitating continued occupation by a Union garrison. = Washington D.C. Fortifications = Washington D.C. Fortifications map Over the seven weeks that followed the occupation of northern Virginia, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.J.G. Barnard and W.F. Barry, \\"Report of the Engineer and Artillery Operations of the Army of the Potomac from Its Organization to the Close of the Peninsular Campaign,\\" (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1863), pp. 9‚Äì10. While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101‚Äì110. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington. On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses. > In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous > resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and > numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... > not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side.

To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 679. Alexandria, which contained the southern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and one of the largest ports in the Chesapeake Bay, was an object of \\"anxious study.\\"Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 680.

Barnard to take charge of construction to begin creation of a complete system of defenses.Civil War Defences, Chronology, NPS, 29-Oct-2004 Gen. Horatio Wright, who had overseen the construction of Fort Ellsworth, and Gen. John Newton, who was in charge of the forts south of Four Mile Run, supervised the construction and managed the flow of men and materials.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 684. The fort was constructed upon Vaucluse, a plantation that was seized from the Fairfax family. Construction began on September 1, 1861. The perimeter was 463 yards, with places for 25 guns, including one 100-pound Parrott rifle.  Wartime use  On Wednesday, November 27, 1861, Col. J.

Tara Mines is a zinc and lead mine near Navan, County Meath, Ireland. Tara is an underground mine where the orebody lies between 50 and 900 metres below the surface in carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits. The deposit was discovered in 1970 by Derek Michael Romer while working for Pat Hughes' Northgate Exploration. Development started in 1973 and production began in 1977. Tara Mine is operated by Boliden. It is the largest zinc mine in Europe and the eighth largest in the world producing 200,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 40,000 tonnes of lead concentrate annually. The mine life extends past 2015.Tara Mines Website The planning conditions for the Tara mines included: * The mining site was to be screened by trees to reduce visual impact. * Noise and air pollution were closely monitored. * Large quantities of mining waste or tailings were carefully managed. * Water used in the operation was purified before being released into the Blackwater River. Broken ore is delivered to one of five underground crushers and reduced in size to less than 150mm before being carried by conveyor to a 3,600t capacity storage bin at the base of the production shaft. Skip loading and hoisting are automatic. Ore is supplied, at an hourly rate of 570 tonnes, to the surface coarse ore storage building, with a 30,000t capacity, known as the Tepee. The concentrates are shipped via Dublin Port to Boliden's smelters in Kokkola, Finland and Odda, Norway and to other smelters throughout Europe. Tara Mines is connected by railway to Drogheda via Navan, where daily loads of ore are sent to Dublin Port. Due to low zinc prices, production was halted between 2001 and 2003. In 2009 production was again threatened as demand for zinc, used to galvanise steel for the car and construction industries, declined sharply due to the slowdown in the global economy. Zinc and lead prices maintained their strength throughout 2011 due to continued demand from China and India. Ore production from Tara Mines continued strongly throughout 2011. A brand new Autogenous Grinding mill, which replaces large sections of the original crushing and grinding plant, became operational in October 2009.Swedish Boliden says unions accept Tara mine deal References External links * Boliden Tara website Lead mines in Ireland Navan Underground mines in Ireland Zinc mines in Ireland ","title":"Tara Mine"},{"id":"20616062","text":"Pacific Creek may refer to: * Pacific Creek (Teton County, Wyoming) * Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming) * Pacific Creek (British Columbia) ","title":"Pacific Creek"},{"id":"20616065","text":"Parupeneus barberinoides, the bicolor goatfish, is a species of goatfish native to the western Pacific Ocean.

It is the oldest botanical garden in Germany and among the oldest in the world, and open daily without charge. Leipzig's botanical garden dates back to at least 1542,Leipzig Botanic Gardens website although the garden has moved several times. They were created shortly after the university's reform in 1539, when Maurice, Elector of Saxony donated the Dominican monastery of St. Pauli. Its former monastery garden, on the north side of the Paulinerkirche, was reworked as a hortus medicus by May 1543. This first garden was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War, and in 1648 the university acquired a new site (now Grimmaische Street) where in 1653 it created its second garden. In 1807 the garden was moved to the grounds of the Plei√üem√ºhlgraben, where greenhouses were constructed after 1840. By 1857 the garden cultivated more than 10,000 species, of which 4,500 were grown in the greenhouses. In 1876-1877, after the decision to erect a court house on its site, the garden was relocated once again to its present location southeast of Leipzig. The initial size of this new area (2.8 hectares) was extended in 1895, and the new greenhouses (1232 m¬≤) were more than twice as large as those at the previous site. The garden was utterly destroyed in World War II, with the ruins of the Botanical Institute subsequently demolished and backfilled with rubble. By 1954 the show houses had been restored, but economic difficulties in the 1980s led to closure of some greenhouses. After reunification, the garden was completely renovated (1992-2004), with a new butterfly house created in 1996 and five new greenhouses built in 1999-2000. Illustration about vegetables of botanical garden from Acta Eruditorum, 1734 Today the garden contains a total of some 7,000 species, of which nearly 3,000 species comprise ten special collections. The garden contains a systematic department, as well as geographic arrangements of plants from the steppes of Eastern Europe and Asia, forests of the northern hemisphere, prairies, and eastern North America, as well as a marsh and pond with regional flora and an alpine garden containing plants from Asia, Europe, and South America.

The programme was operational from 1996 to 2016. INOGATE was one of the longest running energy technical assistance programmes funded by the EU. Up to 2006, it was funded by the Tacis Regional Cooperation Programme, and as of 2007, it was funded by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) under the ENPI-East Regional Indicative Programme 2007-2010 and 2010‚Äì2013. EuropeAid supported the programme through the ENPI and the Development Cooperation Instrument. The coordinating INOGATE Technical Secretariat was discontinued in April 2016. Origins INOGATE originated in 1995 as an EU support mechanism dealing with INterstate Oil and GAs Transportation to Europe (whence it derived its name as an acronym).Website of EC Delegation in Central Asia It was particularly concerned initially with oil and gas pipelines running from and through Eastern Europe and the Caucasus to the EU. In 2001, a formal 'Umbrella Agreement' was signed by twenty one countries in Kiev, to cooperate on pipeline development and enhancement.International Energy Agency (2006), p. 208 Following conferences in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2004 and in Astana, Kazakhstan, INOGATE evolved into a broader energy partnership between the EU and countries of the former Soviet Union, (excluding the Russian Federation and the Baltic States, but including Turkey), and concentrating on four key topics: * enhancing energy security * convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles * supporting sustainable energy development * attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest. Partner countries The INOGATE partner countries are: Turkey is an INOGATE partner country and was, therefore, regularly invited to attend INOGATE meetings but it is not a beneficiary country. The Baku Initiative and the Astana Declaration The Baku Initiative resulted from a policy dialogue on energy cooperation between the European Union and the INOGATE partner countries. The initiative was announced on 13 November 2004 at the Energy Ministerial Conference in Baku. A second Ministerial Conference was held in Astana on 30 November 2006 which confirmed the broader remit of the INOGATE programme to cover a range of energy issues in the Partner Countries and their cooperation in these issues with the EU. One objective of the Baku Initiative is to enhance integration of the energy markets of participating countries with the EU energy market, so as to create transparent energy markets, capable of attracting investment and enhancing security of energy supply. (Other aspects of the Initiative were concerned with transport issues: see main article). The partner countries agreed objectives to harmonise legal and technical standards so as to create a functioning integrated energy market in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks; to increase the safety and security of energy supplies by extending and modernising existing infrastructure, substituting outdated power generation infrastructures with environmentally friendly systems; the development of new infrastructures and implementation of modern monitoring systems; improvement of energy supply and demand management through the integration of efficient and sustainable energy systems; and promotion of the financing of commercially and environmentally viable energy projects of common interest. A 'road-map' towards achievement of these and allied objectives was adopted at the Astana Ministerial Conference. Structure and activities The coordinating body of INOGATE was the Technical Secretariat based in Kiev, Ukraine, with regional offices in Tbilisi, Georgia, and in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The INOGATE Secretariat had an important role in ensuring the visibility, the coordination,coherence and sustainability of the programme as a whole as well as the individual projects. The Baku Initiative is implemented through the four working groups, each of which contains members from all partner countries: * Harmonisation of Legal, Regulatory and Institutional framework for market liberalisation * Enhancing Safety and Security of Energy Transportation Networks * Sustainable development * Investment Attraction and Project Facilitation A number of specific projects, financed by the ENPI, were associated with the INOGATE programme, and are listed at the INOGATE webportal. These projects included initiatives to improve safety and security of oil and gas transit structures, to develop coordinated national energy policies in Central Asia, and to support market integration and sustainable energy initiatives in partner countries. INOGATE was closely involved with the development of the Eastern European Regional Centre for Hydrocarbon Metrology in Boyarka, Ukraine, which 'provides state- of-the-art calibration services for gas transfer within the region and to other countries'.ADE (2010), p. 71 This should form an important element in the development of a regional energy market operating to Western European standards.see Boyarka informative brochure The INOGATE programme hadan ongoing schedule of conferences and publications. Its webportal contained regularly updated information and news on energy developments in partner countries and relevant EU initiatives and policies. The programme supported reduction in Partner Countries, their dependency on fossil fuels and imports, improvement of the security of their energy supply, and climate change mitigation. Projects An 'INOGATE Project' was any EU-funded regional energy project supporting energy policy cooperation in the INOGATE Partner countries in the topics of the four INOGATE areas of cooperation. Since the inception of the Programme in 1996, approximately 61 INOGATE projects have been implemented. In the period 2010-2015 there were three active INOGATE projects: * INOGATE Technical Secretariat (ITS) and integrated programme in support of the Baku Initiative and the Eastern Partnership energy objectives; Duration: 02/2012-01/2015, Total value: ‚Ç¨16.6 million * Energy Saving Initiative in the Building Sector in the Eastern European and Central Asian Countries; Duration: 01/2010 - 12/2013, Total value: ‚Ç¨4.5 million * Sustainable energy programme for Central Asia: renewable energy sources and energy efficiency; Duration: 01/2013-12/2015, Total value: ‚Ç¨4 million. In addition to the INOGATE projects, there was also the following INOGATE-related project (not directly promoted as an INOGATE project but using INOGATE funding and encouraging the same objectives): * Supporting Participation of Eastern European and Central Asian Cities in the 'Covenant of Mayors' (INOGATE-related project); Duration: 09/2011 - 09/2013, Total value: ‚Ç¨2.15 million Each of the individual projects was responsible for ensuring visibility of their actions. However the ITS project promoted their results in the wider framework of the INOGATE Programme.

It is now occupied by the city of Waterbury‚Äôs offices. Architecture The Chase Brass and Copper Company commissioned well-known architect Cass Gilbert to design its corporate headquarters in 1916 across from his recently completed Waterbury city hall. Henry Sabin Chase, the company president, specifically requested that the headquarters be designed to contrast with the style of the city hall, resulting in a design which shunned colonial marble and brick. The Renaissance inspired building relies heavily on Adamesque designs and detailing and evokes the Tower of the Winds in the capitals on the central pavilion‚Äôs columns. The excellent iron and bronze work for the building was entrusted to Philadelphian Samuel Yellin. The building is notable for its excellent curved staircase, elaborate Adamesque plaster ceilings, careful detailing, and high quality materials. The stained-glass window in the staircase quotes Abraham Lincoln \\"Go forward without fear and with manly heart.\\" Interior designer Geoffrey Webster considers the Chase Building to be one of Gilbert‚Äôs finest works. Construction lasted from 1917-19. The company sold its building in 1963 to preservationists for one dollar, who in turn sold it to the city of Waterbury to be used as city offices, a function it still serves today. It is now known as the Chase Municipal Building and is part of Waterbury's Cass Gilbert Historical District.

They have facilities in many countries and manufacture many of the chemicals they sell. History The current Alfa Aesar setup - part of the Johnson Matthey Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division \\\\- comes from a series of company mergers: *Alfa Inorganics was founded in 1962 by Alfred Bader, in a 50:50 venture between Aldrich Chemicals and Metal Hydrides Inc. The purpose was to provide a source of inorganic research chemicals to sit alongside the organic chemicals of Bader's other company: Aldrich Chemicals. It was created to market inorganics, organometallics, and others such as organoboron and organoarsenic reagents. Following the amalgamation of Aldrich and the Sigma Chemical Co, the joint venture was terminated with Alfa reverting to Metal Hydrides ownership (later Ventron, later again Thiokol). In the USA the business was branded as Alfa, and sold only inorganics. In Europe, the business was branded as Alfa-Ventron (to distinguish it from the UK company Alfa Chemicals) and also later sold a limited range of organic chemicals sourced from Lancaster Synthesis. The European sales office was in Karlsruhe, Germany. The USA and European operations used different (though similar) catalogues, with completely different product number sequences and appear to have been run with a high degree of independence from each other. Thiokol eventually tired of the non-mainstream business and sold it to Aesar, who closed the USA site and relocated the business to the Aesar location. *Johnson Matthey Research Chemicals. Johnson-Matthey had two distinct research chemical catalogues, one of high purity inorganic chemicals and metals, the other a (short-lived) range of inorganic reagents, solvents and acids. This was operated from their facility at Royston, Hertfordshire U.K. Royston had manufacturing and machining equipment for high purity metal foils, powders, ribbons and salts. *Aesar. This was Johnson Matthey's part-owned USA distribution agent for their range of high purity inorganics. Aesar had no manufacturing or bottling facilities, being simply a distribution centre. Following the takeover of Alfa, the combined business was rebranded Alfa- Aesar, rationalised on the Aesar location at Ward Hill, and Johnson-Matthey assumed full ownership. This grew in importance to lead the Johnson Matthey research chemical interests. * Lancaster Synthesis, initially based in Lancaster and then Morecambe, Lancashire UK. This business was founded by Eric Wildsmith and Wilf Maughan and specialised in the manufacture and supply of organic research chemicals. The business was sold to MTM PLC for ¬£20,000,000 in 1989, following which Maughan retired and Wildsmith was eventually ousted as Managing Director by the Executive Chairman of MTM : Richard Lines. MTM subsequently went bankrupt, Lines and the MTM Financial Director, Tom Baxter were jailed for fraud, and Lancaster Synthesis (by then rebranded MTM Research Chemicals) was sold to BTP PLC in 1993 - who reverted the name to Lancaster Synthesis. BTP in turn was later sold to Clariant, who had no idea what to do with a catalogue company - and eventually agreed a sale to Johnson Matthey for ¬£14,000,000. Unfortunately a few weeks before the sale was due to complete, an unexplained major fire destroyed the scale-up plant and the majority of the bulk stock. This has echoes of another destructive fire on the eve of the MTM takeover, which totally destroyed a manufacturing laboratory. The Lancaster Synthesis sites have now all closed, with all UK operations moved to the newer Avocado facilities at Heysham. During the period of MTM ownership, a series of other companies were acquired and brought under notional control: Loba Feinchemie (Fischamend, Austria), Farchan Laboratories (Gainesville, Florida) Monomer Polymer & Dajac Labs (USA). These were all sold back to their previous owners or local management following the MTM collapse as they required too high a management input from the UK, and had never been properly integrated. Not long after Farchan was returned to local management it also was destroyed in a fire, subsequently relocating to Columbus, OH close to the location of its founding, where its initial technology had been based on research into high performance aviation fuels during WWII by Henry Channon. During the period of MTM ownership a short-lived distribution agreement existed for Farmitalia-Carlo Erba to distribute Lancaster Synthesis products through a Carlo Erba rebranded version of the LS catalogue. However this venture was a failure and only lasted for one catalogue edition: the Italians proved unable to commit the required marketing resources to the project. * Fairfield Chemicals, Blythewood, South Carolina. This was a small-scale manufacturing plant near Columbia S.C. which specialised in hazardous chemistry, often involving fluorine and phosgene. It was acquired by MTM from its founder, Hiram S. Allen, as a USA manufacturing plant for Lancaster Synthesis, and was the one MTM Research Chemical acquisition that was properly integrated and managed. Like many other similar small chemical sites in that part of South Carolina, it was subject to intense local environmental concerns and pressures, driving Clariant to eventually close the site. However the intellectual property, stock and customers were transferred to Lancaster Synthesis prior to closure. * Avocado Research Chemicals, based in Heysham, Lancashire, UK, specializing in organic chemicals. This was Eric Wildsmiths second foray into the research chemical business. Originally based in Lancaster, it quickly grew, moving to a purpose built location at Heysham following a serious fire at its second location on Caton Road, Lancaster. It was subsequently sold to Johnson-Matthey for ¬£25,000,000 and integrated into Alfa-Aesar, becoming their main organic production plant. Both Lancaster Synthesis and Avocado had close trading links to Alfa at various times prior to the takeover: the organic products sold in Germany through the Alfa-Ventron catalogue were sourced from Lancaster, while Avocado products were distributed both in the USA and Germany by the combined Alfa-Aesar. During the late 1970s / early 1980s, Lancaster Synthesis was the primary UK distribution agent for the USA Alfa range, taking this business over after it was relinquished by Aldrich UK. However this relationship was undermined when Alfa-Ventron independently opened its own short-lived sales unit in the Thiokol-Morton offices in Coventry. On June 25, 2015, Johnson Matthey agreed to sell Alfa Aesar for an amount of ¬£256 million to Thermo Fisher Scientific. Johnson Mattey cited that \\"This is a further step in delivering our strategy to focus on areas where we can apply our expertise in complex chemistry\\". Thermo Fisher Scientific cited that \\"The acquisition of Alfa Aesar enhances our existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents to support virtually every laboratory application ‚Äì from research, to drug discovery and development, to production, In addition, customers will benefit from greater access to these products through our extensive global commercial reach.\\". The acquirement is to be fully completed in the end of 2015. Johnson Matthey and Thermo Fisher Scientific both made statements, as well as Alfa Aesar. Current Manufacturing Their main manufacturing organic chemical facility is located at Heysham, Lancashire, UK. . This has been supplemented by a bulk manufacturing site at Yantai, China Product lines Alfa Aesar supplies a large variety of chemicals for various disciplines including: *Organic chemistry *Inorganic chemistry *Analytical chemistry *Chromatography *Semiconductor manufacturing *Pure chemical elements *Biochemistry and molecular biology *Large scale chemicals & contract manufacturing Alfa Aesar is a major supplier in the research and fine chemicals market offering over 30,000 products - many of which are rare compounds, which are unique to a major catalogue supplier.

Instead they are assigned sobriquets derived from poetic exchanges (e.g. Murasaki takes her name from a poem by Genji), from the particular court positions they occupy (in the Tyler translation, characters are often referred to by such terms as His Highness of War, Her Majesty the Empress, His Grace, the Palace Minister and so on), from their geographical location (e.g. Lady Akashi who lived on the Akashi coast before meeting Genji), or from the name of their residence (e.g. Lady Rokuj≈ç, whose mansion is on the Sixth Avenue, rokuj≈ç, or Fujitsubo, literally wisteria pavilion, the part of the Imperial Palace where this particular lady resided). Out of the two most recent translations into English, Seidensticker‚Äôs tends to systematically employ the same names (e.g. Genji, Murasaki, Akashi, Utsusemi, etc.), whereas Tyler‚Äôs, a more textually accurate translation, tends to change sometimes characters‚Äô appellation with every chapter. Similarly, many women writers of the Heian period left behind their sobriquets alone. Murasaki Shikibu is no exception: ‚ÄúMurasaki‚Äù is presumably borrowed from her character in the tale, whereas ‚ÄúShikibu‚Äù refers to a court position in the Bureau of Ceremonial (shikibu), that her father used to occupy. Notes Following Genji, all the other characters are introduced following the chronology of the events in the tale. However, this chronology does not take into account the first time a character is mentioned, but rather the time a character actually makes his or her debut into the tale. Some of the character descriptions below include a reference to the chapter in which the character is introduced to the narrative. Important characters are in capital letters. Characters *Prince Genji (Hikaru Genji/ the Shining Genji/ the Shining Prince) ‚Äì The eponymous hero of the tale, he is the son of an emperor (usually referred to as Kiritsubo Emperor) and of a low- ranking imperial concubine (known to readers as Lady Kiritsubo or Kiritsubo K≈çi). Many scholars have tried to decipher the real or fictional model behind the character of Genji. Some of the favorite candidates are Ariwara no Narihira (the hero of The Tales of Ise), Emperor Murakami, Sugawara no Michizane, Minamoto no T≈çru or Fujiwara no Korechika.Ivan Morris, The World of the Shining Prince, 1994, 285. Independently of Murasaki Shikibu's sources of inspiration, Hikaru Genji cannot be simply reduced to being a mere fictional reflection of a real historical figure. In the tale, Genji occupies center stage from chapters one to forty-one and the narrative focuses on his amorous exploits and political successes. Although demoted to commoner status (and forced to take the name of Minamoto), Genji rises in rank to the position of Honorary Retired Emperor and lives to see his children becoming Emperor, Empress and Minister, respectively. In the realm of amorous relationships, the narrative follows Genji from his adventurous youth, a time in which he engages in multiple relationships with women of various ranks, to his mature years, when his political and erotic success is best reflected in his Rokuj≈ç-in mansion, a residence built to shelter the most important women in his life and to mirror the Imperial Palace (or at least its hidden quarters reserved to the emperor's female staff). The peak of Genji's glory, however, also announces his slow but inexorable decline, and chapters such as ‚ÄúNowaki‚Äù and ‚ÄúWakana‚Äù reveal his vulnerability in front of a new generation of young heroes, Y≈´giri and Kashiwagi. The disintegration of Genji's world becomes final with the death of his beloved Murasaki, in chapter forty, ‚ÄúMinori,‚Äù and not long after, the Prince's shining light is finally extinguished. *Lady Kiritsubo (the Kiritsubo Intimate/ Kiritsubo K≈çi/ Kiritsubo Consort) ‚Äì Genji's mother and the favorite of Emperor Kiritsubo, Lady Kiritsubo is disadvantaged at court because she lacks parental support. Her father, a Grand Counselor, is already dead at the beginning of the narrative, and her mother cannot provide her with political support. Thus, the lady provokes the jealousy of other imperial concubines, in particular that of the Kokiden Consort, a lady with well- founded hopes of becoming Empress. As a result, Kiritsubo is constantly harassed by the other women and the humiliations she has to suffer at court eventually trigger her premature death, only three years after having given birth to Genji. Her name is derived from the Paulownia Pavilion, where she resided while at the Imperial Court, the farthest location from the emperor's chambers and symbolic of the lady's low status (at least when compared to other imperial concubines). (chapter 1). The character of Kiritsubo is loosely based on the historical Yang Guifei. *Emperor Kiritsubo (Kiritsubo no Mikado) ‚Äì Genji's father, who despite the large social gap between him and the Kiritsubo Lady, maintains an unwavering devotion to her, tragically exposing her to the jealousy of his other consorts. Aware of Genji's fate were he to attract the hostility of the Kokiden Lady, and also worried about the predictions made by a Korean soothsayer concerning Genji's potential future (as an emperor, Genji would bring about unrest; as a minister, he would also face foreboding uncertainty), the Emperor demotes Genji from imperial prince to commoner. Thus, at least in theory, Genji is forbidden to ascend to the throne. Instead, Kiritsubo Emperor names Suzaku, Genji's stepbrother and the son of the ambitious Kokiden Lady as Heir Apparent (or Crown Prince). Furthermore, the emperor also arranges Genji's marriage to Aoi, the daughter of the Minister of the Left and, by this, ensures that his son will benefit from the powerful political support of his father-in-law, the only one able to balance the influence of Kokiden and her party. Sometime after the death of his beloved Kiritsubo, the emperor learns of the existence of an imperial princess, referred to as Fujitsubo (again, after the name of her residence, the Wisteria Pavilion), who uncannily resembles his lost love. Of an incomparable higher status than her unfortunate predecessor, Fujitsubo goes on to become the emperor's favorite and ultimately Empress, but her resemblance to Genji's mother also attracts Genji's initially childish interest in her. This childish interest, once turned erotic, fuels much of the later narrative plot.(chapter 1; dies chapter 10) *Suzaku (later, Emperor Suzaku/ Suzaku (Tale of Genji)) ‚Äì The son of Kiritsubo Emperor by the Kokiden Lady, Genji's half- brother and grandson of the powerful Minister of the Right, he is named Heir Apparent, although the Kiritsubo Emperor would have personally preferred to make Genji a Crown Prince. Apparently a pathetic figure throughout the narrative (he is cuckolded by Genji, sees the women he would like to have taken away from him, becomes a puppet in the hands of his mother and her political faction), Suzaku still retains a tragic dignity, especially during the ‚ÄúWakana‚Äù chapters, when, after having abdicated and taken Buddhist vows, his religious devotion is obstructed by his excessive paternal love for his favorite daughter, the Third Princess (Onna San No Miya/ Ny≈çsan). Moreover, at least one Genji critic distinguishes Suzaku's vengeful potential, by identifying him with the possessing spirit affecting the women of the Uji chapters.Tyler, Royall and Susan. ‚ÄúThe Possession of Ukifune.‚Äù Asiatica Venetiana, 5 (2002): 177‚Äì209.(chapter 1; like Genji's death, Suzaku's death is not featured in the narrative) *Lady Kokiden (Kokiden Consort) ‚Äì Kiritsubo Emperor's consort of higher rank (ny≈çgo) than Lady Kiritsubo (k≈çi), she is the daughter of the powerful Minister of the Right. Bitterly jealous of the emperor's love for Kiritsubo, once her rival is dead, her animosity comes to affect her rival's son, Genji. Thus, due to political scheming, she finally has her son, Suzaku, appointed Heir Apparent. Nevertheless, once Fujitsubo debuts into the narrative, Kokiden is confronted with a much more powerful rival, one that is more high-ranking than Kiritsubo and thus can claim the title of Empress, leaving Kokiden to content herself with being ‚Äúonly‚Äù the Empress Mother. Time and again, Kokiden figures in the narrative as Genji's archrival, plotting and scheming to eliminate him from court and finally succeeding in stripping him of his rank and sending him into exile at Suma. Genji's return from exile marks the beginning of his political ascension and also his victory over the Kokiden Lady.(chapter 1‚Äì14) *Lady Fujitsubo (Her Highness/ Majesty Fujitsubo) ‚Äì Daughter of a previous emperor and thus imperial princess, Fujitsubo enters the service of Emperor Kiritsubo at the age of sixteen, mainly because of her resemblance to the deceased Lady Kiritsubo. She soon becomes an imperial favorite, but also Genji's childhood crush and later lifelong obsession. By chapter seven, ‚ÄúMomiji no ha,‚Äù it becomes obvious that Fujitsubo and Genji are already involved in an illicit love affair (although the author does not describe, but rather implies the beginning of the relationship), the result of which is the birth of Reizei (future emperor) whom everyone, except the two lovers, believes to be the son of the Kiritsubo Emperor. Elevated to the rank of Empress and having her son named Heir Apparent (Reizei is supposed to succeed Suzaku), Fujitsubo gradually grows more and more troubled by guilt and the fear of having her secret exposed. Once Genji's advances intensify and, in the public realm, the faction of the Kokiden Lady comes to power, Fujitsubo's only countermeasure is to take vows and become a nun (‚ÄúSakaki‚Äù). By this, she hopes on the one hand, to permanently put Genji off and eliminate the risk of their affair being discovered and, on the other hand, to reassure Kokiden that she renounces any secular, political claims to power. After Genji's return from exile, she forms a political alliance with him and turns into a genuine ‚Äúpolitically ambitious‚ÄùNorma Field, The Splendor of Longing in The Tale of Genji, 1987. figure in the tale. Only on her deathbed (in ‚ÄúUsugumo‚Äù) does she return to being a romantic heroine. Nevertheless, Fujitsubo's importance in the tale lies beyond her immediate contribution to the plot, in what Norma Field termed as being an ‚Äúoriginal substitute‚Äù (she makes her debut as a substitute for Kiritsubo, yet, later, Genji will look for substitutes for her, in women such as Utsusemi, the Third Princess, but most of all, in Murasaki). (chapter 1; chapter 10 becomes a nun; chapter 19 dies) *≈åmy≈çbu(Fujitsubo's ≈åmy≈çbu) ‚Äì She is a lady-in-waiting in Fujitsubo's service and Genji's accomplice. Her major narrative role is to facilitate Genji's access to Fujitsubo, an event which will have as its result the birth of the future emperor Reizei. In addition, she acts as a go-between in their epistolary exchanges. (chapters 5‚Äì12) *Minister of the Left (Sadaijin) ‚Äì Genji's father-in-law, father to Aoi and T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç, his role is to maintain perfect political balance at the Emperor Kiritsubo's court by countering the influence exerted by the Minister of the Right. He is entrusted with Genji's fate and becomes his protector during Genji's younger years. With the death of the Kiritsubo Emperor however, the Minister falls out of favor and eventually retires from public activities altogether. His main wife is Princess ≈åmiya, the mother of Aoi and T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç.(chapter 1-chapter 19) *Minister of the Right (Udaijin) ‚Äì Kokiden Lady's father and thus Kiritsubo emperor's father-in-law, the Minister of the Right plays a role similar to the historical position of the Fujiwara leaders (see Fujiwara clan). Like them, the Minister marries his daughter to the emperor, has his grandchild appointed Heir Apparent and rules de facto after the abdication (in the Genji, after the death) of the emperor. Although one of Genji's enemy, the Minister is often portrayed as un-courtly, indiscreet, even headstrong, but never more evil or more determined to destroy Genji than his daughter, the Kokiden Consort. The Minister of the Right is also T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç's father-in-law.(chapter 1-chapter 13) *T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç ‚Äì The son of the Minister of the Left and brother of Aoi, he becomes Genji's friend and rival in love during the Prince's adolescence and youth. Their relationship remains fairly harmonious for the first twelve chapters of the tale: they engage in conversations about women, share their amorous experiences and love letters and, once in a while compete, or pretend to compete, in conquering a woman (with Suetsumuhana, the competition seems more genuine, whereas in the case of Gen no naishi, it is a mock-competition meant to create a humorous interlude). Unbeknownst to T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç however, Genji has an affair with one of his former mistresses, Y≈´gao, finds out about the existence of his friend's child, yet reveals nothing to him and, for all that we know, T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç remains ignorant of this affair until the end. After Genji's return from exile however, his friendly rivalry with T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç is no longer related to love matters, but becomes political. Although associated with the Fujiwara clan, T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç is not on the winning side: the daughters he sends to court are always outshined by Genji's own candidates so that T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç can never get to play the part of a Fujiwara regent. Later in the tale, the two heroes, Genji and T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç seem to reach some sort of reconciliation once Genji reveals to T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç the existence of his daughter, Tamakazura, and the latter finally accepts Y≈´giri, Genji's son, as his son-in-law.(chapter 1-chapter 41) *Lady Aoi (Aoi no Ue) ‚Äì Daughter of the Minister of the Left (T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç's sister) and Genji's first principal wife, she marries Genji when she is sixteen and he only twelve. Proud and distant to her husband, Aoi is constantly aware of the age difference between them and very much hurt by Genji's philandering. For only a short while, after giving birth to Genji's son, Y≈´giri, and suffering episodes of spirit possession, does Aoi actually appear sympathetic in Genji's eyes. The episode of spirit possession itself (mono no ke) is extremely controversial and brings to the fore two female characters in the tale: Aoi (Genji's wife) and Lady Rokuj≈ç (Genji's mistress). The relationship between the two women may be that between victim and aggressor, if one follows the traditional interpretation of spirit possession,Royall Tyler tends to interpret spirit possession at face value, at least in the case of another female character, Ukifune. Tyler, Royall and Susan. ‚ÄúThe Possession of Ukifune.‚Äù Asiatica Venetiana, 5 (2002): 177‚Äì209. or that between accomplices expressing their discontent with the Heian system of polygynous marriage (and with Genji, obviously).Doris Bargen, A Woman‚Äôs Weapon: Spirit Possession in The Tale of Genji, Honolulu: University of Hawai‚Äôi Press, 1997. Aoi dies at the end of the ‚ÄúAoi‚Äù chapter and her exit from the tale is thus definitive.(chapter 1-chapter 9) *Governor of Kii (Ki no Kami) ‚Äì One of Genji's retainers, he is the son of the Iyo Deputy and stepson of Utsusemi. Later becomes Governor of Kawachi. (chapters 2 and 16) *Deputy Iyo (Iyo no Suke) ‚Äì He is the father of the Governor of Kii and husband of Utsusemi. Later becomes the Deputy Governor of Hitachi. (chapters 2,4 and 16) *Utsusemi (Á©∫Ëùâ/Cicada Shell/ Lady of the Locust Shell) ‚Äì She is the wife of the Iyo Deputy and stepmother of the Governor of Kii. She attracts Genji's attention, but resists his courtship despite his repeated attempts to win her over. Although she will not become a central character in the tale, Utsusemi is memorable as the first woman Genji courts in the tale and whose courtship the readers actually witness and also, arguably, as the first to resist him (chapters 2,3,4; reenters the tale in chapter 16; is mentioned again in chapter 23). A lady of lower rank, after the death of her father she has no choice but to become the second wife of the Iyo Deputy, whose first wife is dead at the time of the narrative (Chapter 2 ‚ÄúHahakigi‚Äù). She accidentally attracts Genji's attention during one of his visits to the Governor of Kii's mansion. Forced to avoid a directional taboo, young Genji leaves his father-in-law's mansion at Sanj≈ç and takes refuge to his retainer's house. Ritual purification also forced the women of the Iyo Deputy's household, Utsusemi included, to temporarily reside in the same place. Having heard some feminine voices and the movements in an adjacent room, Genji becomes interested in the Governor's step-mother, whom he already knew was young and potentially attractive. That very same night, Genji steals into the women's quarters and under the guise of being a lady-in-waiting (Utsusemi is calling for Ch≈´j≈ç, which is both the sobriquet of her servant and Genji's current rank of captain), he slips next to Utsusemi. Once the lady realizes who he really is, she is terrified and would like to call for help, were it not for her awareness that such a discovery would only bring her shame. Even so, she still rejects his advances and keeps strong despite his seductive words, until Genji, at a loss, can only think of taking her away to a more private location. As he carries her out of the room, he encounters the real Ch≈´j≈ç who is more than ready to defend her mistress against this unknown intruder until she too realizes who he is. Genji's rank and status is simply too high for the two women to dare raise a commotion. Once Genji secures Utsusemi's location, he continues to pour out sweet words and promises, yet the lady ‚Äúwas as (...) the young bamboo: she bent but was not to be broken.‚ÄùSeidensticker, The Tale of Genji, 1993, 43. Despite the textual description, many Genji critics read the incident as Genji's success despite the lady's resistance. Their interpretation lies heavily on one verb in the original, miru, which, although has multiple meanings, also refers to ‚Äúmaking love, carnally knowing someone.‚Äù Because of this one meaning among many, the traditional interpretation of the scene was that Genji does manage to break through Utsusemi's defenses and ends up sleeping with her. Other critics however, most prominently Margaret Childs,Childs, Margaret H. ‚ÄúThe Value of Vulnerability: Sexual Coercion and the Nature of Love in Japanese Court Literature.‚Äù The Journal of Asian Studies, 58, no. 4 (1999): 1059‚Äì1079. prefer to reject this interpretation as unfounded. After the incident in question, Genji tries to see the lady two more times. The first time, she finds out about his arrival and takes refuge into another wing of the house, where she surrounds herself with her ladies-in-waiting. Frustrated, Genji ends up taking her younger brother to bed, as her replacement. This episode is considered the sole explicit example of homosexual relations in the tale. The second time, Genji manages to get close to her and he even gets to spy on her playing go with her step-daughter, Nokiba no ogi. This kaimami (man spying on one or multiple women through a gap in the fence/ curtain/ screen) became a favorite screen among Genji artists and has been often illustrated as representation for chapter 3 ‚ÄúUtsusemi.‚Äù After having spied on her, Genji, with the complicity of Utsusemi's younger brother, Kogimi, steals into her chamber again. Aware of his presence, Utsusemi manages to escape from Genji's embrace by discarding her outer robe like a cicada discards its shell (hence the chapter title). In her desire to escape him, the lady also abandons behind her sleeping step-daughter, who becomes Genji's unwitting prey. Unwilling to admit defeat, or rather to sleep alone for the night, Genji makes do with what is left behind and ends sleeping with Nokiba no ogi, who does not even imagine she has been the victim of mistaken identity. At the end of the fourth chapter, \\"Yugao\\", Utsusemi leaves the capital with her husband who has been appointed governor of a province. Nokiba no ogi also gets married and leaves the narrative. Utsusemi returns in chapter sixteen, ‚ÄúSekiya,‚Äù when she meets Genji on her return from the provinces. They exchange poems, and Utsusemi is shown to regret not being able to accept Genji's advances (because of Utsusemi's marriage and differences in rank). Last time the readers encounter Utsusemi is in chapter twenty-three, ‚ÄúHatsune,‚Äù where they learn that she has become a nun after her husband's death. The reason behind her decision is her desire to escape the unwelcome amorous attentions of her step-son, the Governor of Kii. After taking the tonsure, Utsusemi comes to depend upon Genji and takes residence in his former home (his home before the building of the Rokuj≈ç-in), Nij≈ç-in. * Ch≈´j≈ç (Utsusemi's Ch≈´j≈ç) ‚Äì She is Utsusemi's servant. Her name literally means ‚Äúthe captain.‚Äù Genji was a Captain in the Palace Guards at the time of his meeting with Utsusemi, so he is able to steal into the lady's chambers by taking advantage of the confusion between Ch≈´j≈ç's name and his rank. (Utsusemi calls for Ch≈´j≈ç and Genji pretends he misinterpreted her words). Because there are six other ladies-in-waiting in the tale all referred to as ‚ÄúCh≈´j≈ç‚Äù, the best way to differentiate among them is by the identities of their mistresses or masters.(chapter 2) *Kogimi ‚Äì He is Utsusemi's brother and 12 or 13 at the time of the narrative in the ‚ÄúHahakigi‚Äù chapter. Genji is delighted with the boy and uses him as a go-between in the letter exchanges with Utsusemi and Nokiba no ogi. At the end of the ‚ÄúHahakigi‚Äù chapter, frustrated because he cannot reach Utsusemi, who took refuge in a different pavilion of the Governor of Kii's mansion, Genji beds little Kogimi as a replacement for his sister. This episode constitutes the only open reference to homosexuality (and pederasty) in the tale. The boy reappears in chapter sixteen, ‚ÄúSekiya‚Äù, as Second of the Right Gate Watch (in Tyler's translation), but by then he is already an adult and of no relevance to the narrative.(chapters 2 and 3; reappears in chapter 16) *Nokiba no Ogi ‚Äì She is the daughter of the Iyo Deputy and the sister of the Governor of Kii, in other words, Utsusemi's stepdaughter. She is a fleeting presence in the tale and only briefly does she take center stage in chapter three, ‚ÄúUtsusemi.‚Äù During his pursuit of the Lady of the Locust Shell, Genji engages in kaimami (lit. ‚Äúpeeping through a hole‚Äù) on Utsusemi and Nokiba no ogi playing go. When later, he intrudes into the lady's bedchamber with Kogimi's complicity, Genji fails to capture Utsusemi, who flees leaving behind her outer robe and her sleeping stepdaughter. Having been caught in a case of mistaken identity, Genji cannot extricate himself from the situation and ends up sleeping with Nokiba no ogi (whom he woos into believing she is indeed the object of his desire). Needless to say that Genji quickly forgets this unfortunate event and, later, when he finds out about the girl's prospective marriage, he is confident that, married or not, Nokiba no ogi will never refuse his advances.(chapters 3,4) *Koremitsu ‚Äì He is Genji's foster brother (in fact his milk brother, menotogo; Koremitsu's mother was Genji's wet nurse), trusted servant and accomplice. He plays his most prominent part in the ‚ÄúY≈´gao‚Äù chapter, where he approaches Y≈´gao and facilitates Genji's subsequent courtship of the lady. After Y≈´gao's death, it is Koremitsu who carries her dead body and arranges for her funeral rites. Similarly to the Y≈´gao episode, Koremitsu also serves Genji in the following chapter, ‚ÄúWakamurasaki,‚Äù where he acts as a go-between for Genji and Sh≈çnagon, Murasaki's nurse, as well as Genji's accomplice in the kidnapping of Murasaki. A very useful servant and mediator in Genji's love affairs, Koremitsu even accompanies Genji during his exile to Suma. Later in the tale, however, his presence becomes more sporadic.(chapters 4‚Äì21) *Y≈´gao ‚Äì She is a woman of lower status of about nineteen with whom Genji has a short affair in the eponymous chapter four, ‚ÄúY≈´gao.‚Äù Before encountering Genji, Y≈´gao was T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç's mistress and even gave him a daughter, the future Tamakazura. However, because of the jealousy of T≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç's main wife, Y≈´gao leaves him and goes into hiding. It is under these circumstances that Genji encounters her, while out visiting his former wet nurse (Koremitsu's mother). The woman's name translates as ‚ÄúEvening Faces‚Äù and refers to the flowers that attract Genji's attraction to Y≈´gao's shabby abode. Genji becomes very fond of this woman, of whom he apparently knows next to nothing, and proceeds to move her to an abandoned mansion where she falls prey to spirit possession and dies. The possessing spirit is traditionally associated with Lady Rokuj≈ç. (chapter 4) *Ukon (Y≈´gao's Ukon) ‚Äì She is the daughter of Y≈´gao's nurse and the lady-in- waiting closest to Y≈´gao. Orphaned at an early age, Ukon was raised by Y≈´gao's father and grew up together with the lady, whom she is extremely attached to. After losing Y≈´gao, she wants to follow her mistress into death, but gives in to Genji's pleas and enters his service. She will come to play a great role in the discovery of Y≈´gao's daughter, Tamakazura. There are two other ladies-in- waiting named Ukon in the tale (one in the service of Naka no Kimi, the other in the service of Ukifune, but only the latter plays a similarly important role as Y≈´gao's Ukon).(chapters 4 and 22) *Lady Rokuj≈ç (Rokuj≈ç no miyasudokoro) ‚Äì She is a lady of high birth and Genji's senior by seven years. Introduced in the tale narrative in chapter four, ‚ÄúY≈´gao,‚Äù as Genji's lover, Rokuj≈ç is not mentioned in any of the previous chapters. Nevertheless, the later narrative does clarify certain biographical aspects related to this lady. Thus, she is the widow of a former Crown Prince (presumably one of Emperor Kiritsubo's brothers) and would have become an empress, if not for her husband's untimely death. Because of her outstanding social position, she is entitled to be treated with the utmost respect, a fact which Genji, too caught up in his philandering, neglects to do. Humiliated by Genji's disrespect for her, angered and jealous by the rumors of his affairs, Rokuj≈ç becomes the perfect candidate for being the possessing spirit behind Y≈´gao's demise, at least in traditional interpretations of the tale. Her identification as possessing spirit is further reinforced in the ‚ÄúAoi‚Äù chapter, where several clues seem to make her the culprit in Aoi's possession and death. Troubled by the gossip about her involvement in Aoi's possession, Rokuj≈ç herself comes to believe in her own guilt. As a result, she decides to follow her daughter, appointed as Priestess, to Ise. After her return to the capital, she entrusts her daughter, Akikonomu, to Genji and dies in chapter fourteen, ‚ÄúMiotsukushi.‚Äù Following her death, she keeps being identified as the spirit inflicting torment upon Genji's women, Murasaki and the Third Princess to be exact. (chapters 4‚Äì14; as the presumed possessing spirit, chapters 35,36) *Lady Murasaki (Murasaki no Ue) ‚Äì She is the daughter of Prince Hy≈çbu by a minor consort and related to Fujitsubo on her father's side (Hy≈çbu is Fujitsubo's brother, hence Murasaki is Fujitsubo's niece). She makes her debut into the tale as a substitute for her unattainable aunt, but she gradually outshines Fujitsubo in Genji's and the readers‚Äô eyes, turning into ‚Äúa substitute for all seasons.‚Äù In fact, her very name, ‚ÄúMurasaki‚Äù translated as ‚ÄúLavender,‚Äù plays on the similarity of two colors (the color ‚Äúmurasaki‚Äù is purple of a darker hue than ‚Äúfuji‚Äù, wisteria, of Fujitsubo's name). Discovered by Genji in the Northern Hills when she is only ten, she is taken into his Nij≈ç residence after the death of her grandmother (the episode of her kidnapping has definite violent undertones) where she is molded into Genji's ideal woman, not unlike the myth of Galatea, with whom she is often compared.Komashaku Kimi, Murasaki Shikibu no messƒìji (T≈çky≈ç: Asahi Shinbunsha, 1991). She remains Genji's most important lover throughout the tale, but, because of her imperfect social status (she is of royal blood on her father's side, but her mother was a commoner), she can never be acknowledged as Genji's main wife (kita no kata). For that reason, her position is perpetually insecure, especially when Genji's attention shifts to other women including Akashi, Asagao, but most importantly, the Third Princess. Childless her entire life, Murasaki can only adopt Genji's daughter by the Akashi Lady and raise her to become an empress. Towards the end of her life, she repeatedly expresses her desire to become a nun, but meets Genji's resolute opposition. She becomes the victim of spirit possession in chapter 35 (the aggressor is once more identified as Rokuj≈ç, though this interpretation has been debated ) and dies in chapter 40 without having realized her wish. Murasaki as a character of the Genji has triggered much debate among scholars. Some see her as an utterly miserable character, while others claim that her relationship with Genji is the best things that could have happened to a woman of Murasaki's status.Royall Tyler, ‚ÄúI am I‚Äù: Genji and Murasaki,‚Äù Monumenta Nipponica 54, no4 (1999). The beauty of this character resides precisely in its complexity. (chapters 5‚Äì40) *Sh≈çnagon (Murasaki's Sh≈çnagon) ‚Äì She is Murasaki's nurse and most important protector after the grandmother. Even so, after the grandmother's death, Sh≈çnagon is not high-ranking enough to oppose Genji's plans and, faced with the decision of either to follow her young mistress to Genji's Nij≈ç (at the risk of being accused of kidnapping by Prince Hy≈çbu, once he finds out the girl is missing) or to abandon her, she takes the first choice. Later, impressed by Genji's social standing as well as by the care he devotes to Murasaki, Sh≈çnagon is quite happy with her decision. As Murasaki ages, Sh≈çnagon slips out of the narrative unnoticed. (chapters 4‚Äì12) *Kitayama no Amagimi (The Nun, Murasaki's grandmother) ‚Äì She is Murasaki's maternal grandmother who took custody of the child after the mother's death. While alive, she adamantly rejects Genji's offers of taking care of the girl because she sees through his innocent- looking pleas and guesses his ulterior sexual designs for Murasaki.Royall Tyler, trans., The Tale of Genji, p. 91. At the same time, she does not want Murasaki to return to her father's household for fear of Prince Hy≈çbu's main wife, whose jealousy of Murasaki's mother might make her persecute the child as well. After the grandmother's death, Genji takes advantage of the situation and spirits Murasaki away before her father is able to take her into his household. (chapter 5) *Prince Hy≈çbu (His Highness of War/ Hy≈çbuky≈ç no Miya) ‚Äì He is Fujitsubo's brother and Murasaki's father. Of royal blood (like Fujitsubo, he is the son of a former emperor), Prince Hy≈çbu is married with a woman suiting his high status who is extremely jealous of Murasaki's mother, a woman below her own social position. The text goes as far as to suggest that Murasaki's mother died because of the constant harassment of Hy≈çbu's main wife, not unlike Kiritsubo. After the woman's death however, Hy≈çbu and his wife are both willing to take Murasaki into their household, but Genji kidnaps her before Hy≈çbu can act. When Murasaki becomes Genji's wife, Hy≈çbu is informed of his daughter's fate and, for a while, his relationship with Murasaki seems good. Once Genji falls out of favor and is exiled however, Hy≈çbu cuts all ties with his daughter, a mistake which Genji will not forgive after he rises to the top of the political hierarchy. *Elderly Lady (ja: Ê∫êÂÖ∏‰æç Gen-no-naishinosukeÔºâ ‚Äì Although most likely in her late forties, the elderly lady still gains the favor of Genji. In The Tale of Genji she flirts with Genji, even though he knows any relationship with her would be inappropriate. *Princess Hitachi (also Old Style Princess) ‚Äì Because her nose is so big, the traditionally minded princess never shows her face in public and is very shy. However, because of her talent at playing the zither, Genji becomes attracted to her. *Lady Akashi ‚Äì Born as a middle-ranked noble, a love affair with Genji was not her own plan, but her father was insistent in getting them involved in a relationship. She gives a birth to a girl, the only daughter of Genji. She brings up her daughter (called Little Lady Akashi, later Empress Akashi) until the age of four, when Genji decides that Lady Murasaki should adopt the little girl. Lady Akashi is saddened, but gradually accepts the situation. Later, she meets her daughter again, now a court lady of the crown prince, and receives many honors as the birth mother of little Lady Akashi. She then receives a letter from her father about his fortune-telling dream. He writes the dream gave him a prediction that his granddaughter by Lady Akashi would become the empress, and he turned all his efforts to realize that prediction. *Y≈´giri ‚Äì The son of Genji and Aoi. His mother dies days after his birth, and he is raised by Genji's father-in-law the Minister of the Left when Genji goes into exile. On Genji's return, Y≈´giri serves as a page in the Emperor's court. Chapter 21 revolves around his education and romance with Kumoinokari when both are 14. The match is long opposed by her father T≈ç No Ch≈´j≈ç, but they eventually win him over and marry in Chapters 32-33. He is the best friend of Kashiwagi, but when that man takes his own life, Y≈´giri becomes obsessed with his widow, the neglected Second Princess. Kumoinokari returns to her father's house with their daughters in the wake of this scandalous affair. (Chapters 12-52) *Tamakazura ‚Äì A daughter of T≈ç No Ch≈´j≈ç and a lady called Yugao, who was later a concubine of Genji. Tamakazura is adopted by Genji. She wants to meet her real father, who doesn't know she is still alive. Genji forms a salon for her admirers. He takes pleasure in watching young men compete for Tamakazura's favor. Her brothers, sons of T≈ç No Ch≈´j≈ç, are involved, not knowing that she is their sister. Genji himself flirts with her, just to see her reaction. Later, she and T≈ç No Ch≈´j≈ç meet again by the courtesy of Genji. Genji plans to marry her well, but she is raped by a middle-aged courtier and becomes his wife instead. =Part II= *Kashiwagi ‚Äì is the eldest son of Naidaijin (T≈ç No Ch≈´j≈ç in his youth) and best friend to Y≈´giri. He has an affair with Genji's youngest wife, Onna san no miya (lit. the Third Princess), which results in the birth of Kaoru.

He falls in love with Oigimi in Uji, the first daughter of Hachinomiya, but she dies. He later fell in love with Ukifune whose features are quite similar to the late Oigimi, but their relationship also fails. *Perfumed Highness or Fragrant Highness (Nio no miya) ‚Äì Nio no miya is the third prince of the current Emperor by Empress Akashi, therefore a grandson of Genji. Nio no miya is the best friend of Kaoru. He is known as a man of love affairs. He falls in love with Naka no kimi in Uji, the second daughter of Hachinomiya and the younger sister of Oigimi.

It opened in 1866, six years after the line, which reached Aberystwyth in August 1867. Services at the time were limited, with only three trains running every day except Sundays. However, even this service enabled Lampeter to become an important station, although the cost of building the railway was slowly bankrupting the company. A steam Locomotive, No7 \\"Carmarthen\\", exploded at Maesycreigiau in 1890, and the Cambrian Railway took the M&M; to court over unpaid bills. The railway was originally owned by the Manchester and Milford Railway Company, but owing to great financial difficulties, it was sold to the Great Western Railway in 1906. In 1911, a branch line was constructed between Lampeter and Aberaeron, known as the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway. During the Second World War, specifically on Saturday 8 July 1944, Lampeter railway station received a contingent of 330 evacuee children from London who were then distributed to homes in and around the local area (including the village of Cribyn). That same day Aberystwyth railway station likewise received 400 evacuee children.The Cambrian News and Welsh Farmers Gazette, 14 July 1944 After the nationalisation of the railways, the passenger service to Aberayron ceased in 1951. Passenger services from Carmarthen ran through to Aberystwyth until flooding severely damaged the line south of Aberystwyth in December 1964. A limited service continued running from Carmarthen to Tregaron for a few months after the line was severed; this was the era of the Beeching Axe and the line was closed to passengers in February 1965. Milk continued to be conveyed by railway until 1973 when the traffic was transferred to the road, and the tracks were lifted shortly afterwards. The former existence of the presence of a railway in Lampeter is still obvious; the large station and goods yard are now part of the University and the Cattle Market. Station Terrace has retained its name, and the railway bridge over the River Teifi near the Co-operative Supermarket still stands. The remains of the platforms still exist on the grounds of the university, heavily overgrown, and is not accessible to the public. A bridge once carried the railway over the A482, but this has since been dismantled, although the trackbed still remains in both directions. Local residents have been campaigning for the return of the railway to Lampeter.

It protrudes into the White Sea, with Onega Bay to the south-west, and Dvina Bay to the north-east. The length of the peninsula is about , and the width varies between and . Geography The coastal area of the peninsula is populated. The villages (counterclockwise) of Nyonoksa, Syuzma, Krasnaya Gora, Pertominsk, Unsky, Yarenga, Lopshenga, Letny Navolok, Letnyaya Zolotitsa, Pushlakhta, Lyamtsa, Purnema, and Nizhmozero are all located at or near the coast. The north-eastern coast of the peninsula is crossed by the Una Bay, a gulf in the Dvina Bay, which is about long. The villages of Una and Luda are located at the inner coast of the Una Bay. The interior of the peninsula (north-west of the line connecting Luda and Purnema) is a wilderness without any permanent population. There is some logging at Verkhneozersk, south-east of Luda. The interior of the peninsula is hilly, and there are many lakes, the biggest of which are Lake Myandozero, Lake Vezhmozero (both lakes drain to the Vezhma River - a tributary of the Una Bay), Lake Lyamitskoye (which drains to the Lyamtsa River, flowing west), and Lake Bolshoye Vygozero (which drains into the Zolotitsa River, also flowing west). Administration Administratively, the peninsula is shared between Onezhsky and Primorsky Districts and the city of Severodvinsk of Arkhangelsk Oblast. On 17 December 1940 Belomorsky District was established on the peninsula, on the areas which previously were parts of Primorsky and Onezhsky Districts. The administrative center of the district became the selo of Pertominsk. On 30 September 1958 Belomorsky District was abolished, and the area of the district was shared between Primorsky and Onezhsky Districts. History and religion The peninsula was settled by Novgorodians not later than the 13th century. The Pomors, living at the coast, are the descendants of the Novgorodians. Most of the villages on the coast of the peninsula have a historical significance. The ensemble of the Purnema Pogost, consisting of St. Nicholas' Church (1618) and the Nativity Church (1860), and the Zaostrovsky Pogost in the village of Nyonoksa, consisting of the Church of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (1683-1688) and the St. Michael Church (1776-1785), are protected at the federal level as a monument of architecture. The village of Lopshenga was featured in the works of Yury Kazakov, a Russian short story writer who traveled extensively in the Russian North. The name of one of the Kazakov's books of short stories is Poedemte v Lopshengu ‚Äî Let us go to Lopshenga. Economy and transportation The economy of the peninsula is based on the timber production and fishery. The village of Luda is connected by an all-season road to Severodvinsk and Onega. There is a boat ferry across the Una Bay. Other villages at the coast have infrequent air and sea connections to Onega and Arkhangelsk. A national park, Onezhskoye Pomorye National Park, was opened on the coast of the Onega Peninsula in 2013 to protect pristine forests.

The Rathdowney Trend, stretches 40 kilometres, between the towns of Abbeyleix and Thurles. The region is a broad plain drained by the Rossetown and Drish Rivers, tributaries of the River Suir, which flows into the sea at Waterford. Exploration of the Rathdowney Trend during the late 1960s and early 1970s identified sporadic occurrences of lead and zinc, although the first significant mineralisation was not discovered until 1984. Lisheen Mine is also in the Rathdowney Trend. Galmoy was exclusively an underground operation. Initially the mine used room-and-pillar methods exclusively but subsequent modifications introduced both benching and drift-and-fill systems where conditions are appropriate, as a means of maximising ore recoveries. At the same time the mining method was designed to ensure that no waste rock needed to be hauled to the surface. Concentrates were transported by truck to New Ross port, County Wexford, about 80 km away, and loaded onto ships for transport to smelters, located mainly in Europe. A miner was killed in an accident in 2007. In 2008 workers at Galmoy Mines were told the mine was to close completely on a phased basis by July 2011, due to dwindling zinc resources at Galmoy and a drop in the price for metal worldwide. Production from the mine ceased in May 2009. Some ore remained unmined and plans were being formulated to recover of some or all of this ore. The mine finally closed in 2012.  Geology  The Galmoy ore bodies are breccia-hosted, generally stratabound lenses of predominantly massive sulphides consisting of sphalerite, argentiferous galena and pyrite/marcasite in varying combinations. Hosted in Lower Carboniferous rocks, they occur at the junction of an argillaceous bioclastic limestone beneath dolomitised Waulsortian limestone.

In the 2008 parliamentary election, she won the Jomoro constituency seat at her first attempt. She is the daughter of Kwame Nkrumah, first President of Ghana.  Early life and education  Samia was born at Aburi in the Eastern Region of Ghana in 1960. She was forced to leave Ghana with her mother and brothers on the day of the 1966 military coup that overthrew Kwame Nkrumah. The family were resettled in Egypt by the Egyptian government. She returned with her family in 1975 at the invitation of General Acheampong's National Redemption Council government and attended Achimota School. However, she left the country again when her mother decided to return to Egypt in the early 1980s. Samia proceeded to London, later completing her studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London in the United Kingdom, where she obtained the degree of Bachelor Arabic Studies in 1991. She also completed a Master's degree at the same institution in 1993.  Politics  She became the first woman to ever head a major political party in Ghana. Her victory, along with three other female members of the party, is hailed as marking the renaissance of the ailing CPP, and an affirmation of the party's long held tradition of promoting women's rights. In an article about her, entitled \\"The new Mandela is a woman\\", the Huffington Post described and analysed her impact on Ghanaian and African politics. She is one of the founders of Africa Must Unite,http://www.africamustunite.net/ which aims to promote Kwame Nkrumah's vision and political culture. As part of this philosophy, she decided to go into active politics in Ghana. She contested the Jomoro constituency seat in the Western Region of Ghana and beat the incumbent MP, Lee Ocran of the National Democratic Congress with a majority of 6,571, winning about 50% of the total valid votes cast. She was elected as the first woman chairperson of the Convention People's Party on 10 September 2011. She won the poll with 1,191 votes, and her nearest contender, the incumbent, polled 353 votes. By this feat, she became the first woman to ever head a major political party in Ghana. Career Samia Nkrumah started work as a bank clerk with the London branch of the Bank of India in 1984. She then worked with Al-Ahram as a journalist in various capacities starting from 1989.

Al-Dandashi graduated from a university in Belgium with a degree in law. During his time at the university, he participated in Arab activist circles. After returning to Syria, he established a law office.Moubayed, p. 220. In 1932, Dandashi and other Arab intellectuals convened in the Mount Lebanon village of Qarnayel and founded the League of Nationalist Action (LNA), a nationalist political group whose main goal was coordinated Arab action in ending European colonialism in the Arab world. Dandashi became the secretary-general of the LNA. With his leadership position, he built a large power base, consisting of intellectuals, lawyers, and student activists. Under al-Dandashi, the LNA emerged as a more confrontational counterweight to the National Bloc which ultimately favored negotiating Syria's independence from French rule through diplomatic and other non-violent means. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, al-Dandashi was \\"an impassioned orator and a hard-line Arab nationalist\\". Al-Dandashi died in 1935 when he looked out from the window while riding a train and his head subsequently struck a tunnel wall..

M√§nnikj√§rve bog in Endla Nature Reserve. Wetland conservation is aimed at protecting and preserving areas where water exists at or near the Earth's surface, such as swamps, marshes and bogs. Wetlands cover at least six per cent of the Earth and have become a focal issue for conservation due to the ecosystem services they provide. More than three billion people, around half the world‚Äôs population, obtain their basic water needs from inland freshwater wetlands. The same number of people rely on rice as their staple food, a crop grown largely in natural and artificial wetlands. In some parts of the world, such as the Kilombero wetland in Tanzania, almost the entire local population relies on wetland cultivation for their livelihoods. Fisheries are also an extremely important source of protein and income in many wetlands. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the total catch from inland waters (rivers and wetlands) was 8.7 million metric tonnes in 2002.Review of the state of world fishery resources: inland fisheries, FAO Fisheries Circular. No. 942, Rev.1. Rome, FAO. 2003. 60p In addition to food, wetlands supply fibre, fuel and medicinal plants. They also provide valuable ecosystems for birds and other aquatic creatures, help reduce the damaging impact of floods, control pollution and regulate the climate. From economic importance, to aesthetics, the reasons for conserving wetlands have become numerous over the past few decades. Wetland definition Various definitions of wetlands exist. The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, also known as the Ramsar Convention, defines wetlands as including: lakes and rivers, swamps and marshes, wet grasslands and peatlands, oases, estuaries, deltas and tidal flats, near-shore marine areas, mangroves and coral reefs, and human-made sites such as fish ponds, rice paddies, reservoirs, and salt pans. Meanwhile, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Wetlands Reserve Program, describes wetlands as \\"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.\\"EPA > Wetlands > Definitions Wetlands vary widely in their salinity levels, climatic zones, supported flora, surrounding geography, whether they are coastal or inland and so on.Wetland Wetland functions The main functions performed by wetlands are: water filtration, water storage, biological productivity, and provide habitat for wildlife.EPA > Wetlands > Wetlands Facts Sheets > Functions and Values of Wetlands Additional functions and uses of wetlands are described in wetland. =Filtration= Wetlands support a vast and intricate food web which provides many functions and services to nature and humans. Wetlands aid in water filtration by removing excess nutrients, slowing the water allowing particulates to settle out of the water which can then be absorbed into plant roots. Studies have shown that up to 92% of phosphorus and 95% of nitrogen can be removed from passing water through a wetland.Ducks Unlimited Canada > Wetland and Waterfowl Conservation > Value of Wetlands > Filter our water Wetlands also let pollutants settle and stick to soil particles, up to 70% of sediments in runoff. Some wetland plants have even been found with accumulations of heavy metals more than 100,000 times that of the surrounding waters' concentration.DU > Conservation > Habitat Without these functions, the waterways would continually increase their nutrient and pollutant load, leading to an isolated deposit of high concentrations further down the line. An example of such a situation is the Mississippi River‚Äôs dead zone, an area where nutrient excess has led to large amounts of surface algae, which use up the oxygen and create hypoxic conditions (very low levels of oxygen). Wetlands can even filter out and absorb harmful bacteria from the water. Their complex food chain hosts various microbes and bacteria, which invertebrates feed on. These invertebrates can filter up to 90% of bacteria out of the water this way. =Storage= Wetlands can store approximately 1-1.5 million gallons of floodwater per acre. When you combined with the approximate total acres of wetlands in the United States (107.7 million acres),Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States 1998 to 2004. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (December 2005), pp. 1-116. means that US wetlands can likely store over a trillion gallons of floodwater. By storing and slowing water, wetlands allow groundwater to be recharged. \\"A 550,000 acre swamp in Florida has been valued at $25 million per year for its role in storing water and recharging the aquifer.\\" And combining the ability of wetlands to store and slow down water with their ability to filter out sediments, wetlands serve as strong erosion buffers. =Biological productivity= Through wetlands ability to absorb nutrients, they are able to be highly biologically productive (able to produce biomass quickly). Freshwater wetlands are even comparable to tropical rainforests in plant productivity. Their ability to efficiently create biomass may become important to the development of alternative energy sources. While wetlands only cover around 5% of the Conterminous United States‚Äôs land surface, they support 31% of the plant species. They also support, through feeding and nesting, up to ¬Ω of the native North American bird species. Bird populations, while playing a major role in food webs, are also the focus of several, well-funded recreation sports. (Waterfowl hunting and bird watching to name a pair) =Wildlife habitat= Wildlife Habitat is important not only for the conservation of species but also for a number of recreational opportunities. As a conservation purpose, wildlife habitat is managed for maintaining and using the resources in sustainable manner. Ninety- five percent of all commercially harvested fish and shellfish in the United States are wetland dependent. Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge is an example of recreational destination for hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography that has a good wildlife management. Some parts of the area are wetlands managed for providing habitat of migratory birds, such as waterfowl and songbirds. The 14 million United States hunters generate in excess of $50 billion annually in economic activity. This does not include the 60 million people that watch migratory birds as a hobby. The Florida Keys wetland area generates more than $800 million in annual tourism income alone. Conservation by country Conservation efforts vary in intensity and method by country. The following list is not comprehensive. =New Zealand= Over 90% of the wetlands in New Zealand have been drained since European settlement, predominantly to create farmland. Wetlands now have a degree of protection under the Resource Management Act 1991. =Republic of Macedonia= The fragments of wetland habitats that are still in existence in the Republic of Macedonia are present as marsh or swamp communities. These patches are present at Studenchishte (small fragment near Ohrid Lake), Pelagonia (village Chepigovo), Negortsi Spa, Bansko, Belchishte wetland and Monospitovo marsh. The large areas of swamps that used to be present in most of the valleys in contemporary Republic of Macedonia have undergone a great transformation over the last 50‚Äì60 years. The main cause for their reduction is land reclamation, drainage, and conversion into arable land for agricultural needs (Smith and Smith, 2003). Some of the remaining wetlands (Negortsi Spa, Bansko) are of great importance for understanding the genesis of marsh vegetation in the Republic of Macedonia as many mountainous marshes and peat bogs suffered anthropogenic transformation due to the capturing of water from mountain springs and streams for the purposes of generating drinking water (Smith, 2003). Accordingly, the fragmentation and transformation of previous swamps had a major impact on faunal distribution and abundance. Amphibians are the most affected species along with invertebrate and vertebrate groups including the European Otter (Lutra Lutra L.). It is listed as Nearly Threatened according to the IUCN‚Äôs red list and mainly found now only in the Belchishte wetland (Smith 2003; Smith and Smith, 2003). The otter has importance for the wetland communities not just in Macedonia but also in other European countries such as the Netherlands and Germany (Reuther, 1995; Reuther et al., 2001). Macedonian wetlands lie within the network of some of the bigger rivers in Macedonia including the Vardar River, a catchment area equal to 80% of Macedonian territory. =South Africa= The South African Department of Environmental Affairs in conjunction with the departments of Water Affairs and Forestry, and of Agriculture, supports the conservation and rehabilitation of wetlands through the Working for Wetlands program.http://wetlands.sanbi.org/ Working for Wetlands The aim of this program is to encourage the protection, rehabilitation and sustainable use of South African wetlands through co- operative governance and partnerships. The program is also a poverty relief effort, providing employment in wetland maintenance. =Sweden= The Swedish national wetland inventory (VMI) is one of the world's most extensive systematic inventories of nature types that has ever been done. VMI has surveyed the wetlands of Sweden below the alpine region during a 25-year period. In total 35 000 objects (sites) are included in VMI, corresponding to an area of 4.3 million hectares, or 10% of the land area of Sweden. The aim of the survey has been to increase the general knowledge of wetlands in Sweden, as a basis for environmental monitoring and natural resources planning. By investigating the impact of human activities on wetlands and identifying the most valuable wetlands, their values can be preserved for future generations. The results from the inventory were also meant to function as background data for the authorities' decisions concerning e.g. drainage permits. =United States= The US wetland conservation efforts are rooted partly in legislative requirements specifying that when a proposal is made to drain or fill a wetland, the proposers in many cases must offset the loss by restoring or constructing wetlands nearby that are of the same or greater size and levels of function. Several states within the US have additional requirements that must be met when wetland alteration is proposed. In addition, several federal programs provide financial incentives for wetland protection to private individuals whose land contains wetlands not completely protected by federal or state laws. A restoration project by the State of Florida in the Everglades acquired U.S. Sugar Corporation land allowing for water delivery, water treatment, and water storage of sufficient quantity and quality to mimic the Everglades' natural system.

The present-day fort has evolved from earlier strongholds that were erected on the site as early as 1638, and has been known in previous incarnations as Fort Royal and Fort de la Republique. The modern-day Fort Saint Louis is both an active naval base and a listed historic site of France. There are daily tours of the fort, though the portion that is still a naval base is off-limits. Naval base Fort Saint Louis is under command of the capitaine de vaisseau in charge of the navy and the naval air forces for the Caribbean (COMAR ANTILLES). The forces based here include the BATRAL Francis Garnier (L9031); the P400 class patrol vessel Fougueuse (P685); and the frigate Vent√¥se (F733). The active part of the fort includes the administrative buildings of the base, the service for naval constructions, the radio station of Pointe des Sables, ammunition storage facilities (at the end of Fort de France), and the Rivi√®re Sal√©e station (20 km away). =Environment= Fort Saint Louis has a commanding view of the anchorage of Fort-de-France, the island's capital city. It stands on a rocky peninsula at the edge of Fort-de-France Bay. The fort has been home to many generations of a small but enduring colony of Green Iguana. The species, Iguana iguana, is not indigenous to Martinique and the reptiles are thought to have arrived by boat from either French Guiana or the √éles des Saintes and thrived in the fort area after their release or escape. History In 1635, during the reign of Louis XIII, Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique established a French colony in Martinique, which the company governed until 1650. In 1638, Jacques Dyel du Parquet (1606-1658), nephew of Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and first governor of Martinique, decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks. The fort was soon destroyed, and rebuilt in 1669, when Louis XIV appointed Jean-Charles de Baas-Castelmore, the Marquis of Baas, as governor-general. Under his orders and those of his successors, particularly the Count of Bl√©nac, the fort was built along the lines of a Vauban design. On 19 July 1674, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Admiral de Ruyter led a Dutch fleet of eighteen warships, nine storeships, and fifteen troop transports bearing 3,400 soldiers in an attack on the fort. The attack lasted three days before the Dutch gave up. After the initial Dutch attack, Governor Sainte Marthe called a war council. Sieur de Gemozat, the Lieutenant du Roi (an engineering officer), was the only member to absolutely reject the option to surrender. Still, Captain Aycard, at ruinous personal cost, scuttled his fully freighted ship to prevent the Dutch vessels from entering the Car√©nage; the King rewarded the captain by authorizing him thereafter to fly an admiral's pennant wherever he went. During the siege, Thomas-Claude Renart de Fuschamberg, future Marquis d'Amblimont, and commander of the warship Les Jeux, used his vessel's guns to prevent the Dutch frigates from approaching the fort more closely, and the Dutch land forces from over-running the North Bastion. Today, the actions of Aycard, de Baas, de Gemozat and D'Amblimont are memorialized in structures in the fort that bear their names. In 1677, Charles de La Roche-Courbon, comte de Bl√©nac, became Governor-General, holding the post until 1683. He was responsible for the 10-year effort that resulted in the building of a 487-meter wall around the peninsula, the wall being four meters high and two meters thick. Comte de Bl√©nac served as Governor-General again from June 1684 to February 1691, and again from 24 Nov 1691 until his death in 1696. His successor was the Marquis d'Amblimont, who had played an important role in the repulse of the Dutch. In January 1759, the fort repulsed an attack by the British sailor, Admiral Rodney. A second British attack three years later was more successful. The British forces occupied two hills overlooking Fort Saint Louis, Morne Garnier and Morne Tartenson. Fort Saint Louis, although strong on the seaward side, was ill-prepared to resist bombardment from above and an attack from the landward. The British were therefore able to force its surrender. During this and subsequent periods of British occupation, the fort bore the name Fort Edward. On 11 February 1763, after the Treaty of Paris returned Martinique to French control, the British left and the fort resumed its name of Fort Royal. The French proceeded to construct a second fort, Fort Bourbon, on Morne Garnier to protect Fort Saint Louis. In 1793, with the advent of the French Revolution, the fort's name was changed to Fort de la Republique. Capture of Fort Saint Louis, Martinique, 1794, Artist: Nicholas Pocock In February 1794, the British Admiral John Jervis attacked Martinique, taking it after a 28-day siege. By 20 March only Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal still held out. Jervis ordered the fourth rate ship of the line HMS Asia (64 guns), and the sloop, HMS Zebra to take Fort Saint Louis. Asia was unable to get close, and so Commander Faulknor of Zebra volunteered to undertake the capture without the help of the larger vessel. Despite facing heavy fire, he ran his sloop close under the walls. He and his ship's company used Zebra's boats to land. The British stormed the fort and captured it. Meanwhile, the boats of the British fleet captured Fort Royal and two days later Fort Bourbon capitulated. The Governor-General of Martinique at the time was Donatien Marie Joseph de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau. The British occupied the fort from 22 May 1794 until September 1802 when the Treaty of Amiens again returned Martinique to France. The fort was renamed Fort Saint Louis. The British captured Martinique again in 1809. During their attack, Commander Charles John Napier of the brig-sloop Recruit noticed that Fort Edward, as he termed it, appeared abandoned. He took a gig and with four men, landed, scaled the fort's walls, and hoisted a British flag. Sir Alexander Cochrane immediately landed marines to occupy the fort and turn its mortars, which its fleeing garrison had not spiked, against the French.Napier (1862), p.17. Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, who had become Governor- General in September 1802, was still in office at the time of the British attack. A Court of Inquiry in Paris in December 1809 stripped the Admiral and some of his subordinates of their rank and honors, holding them responsible for problems with the fortification of Fort Desaix and the subsequent loss of the island. The British occupied the fort from 21 February 1809 to 8 October 1814, and again briefly in 1815 after Napoleon escaped from Elba. Several British regiments, such as the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, the 63rd (The West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot, and others, have 'Martinique 1809' as one of their battle honors. Between 1850 and 1896, the French installed a number of artillery pieces at the fort and at Pointe des Negres to protect the bay.

It is a -story, three-bay Tidewater house constructed between 1761 and 1995. The house illustrates the characteristic pattern of homes from small one- and two-room 18th-century dwellings into the larger houses that survive today. Pleasant Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The land on which Pleasant Hill is located was originally part of a larger tract known as Green's Inheritance. In 1713 John Spalding purchased 200 acres of Green's Inheritance for Pleasant Hill. The home was built in at least three phases. * The first phase was begun in the 1760s by Basil Spalding, grandson of John. The original structure was a single story, two room home with a full cellar. It was made of timber framing with sawn clapboards. There were two chimneys on either end. The cellar was divided into two rooms, one of which had a fireplace and is believed to have been the original kitchen. A 20th century architectural historian described it as a typical middle-class home but \\"of better quality than most.\\" Basil died in 1792 and left the home to his widow, Catherine. * The second phase took place during Basil Jr.'s ownership. Sometime between 1798 and 1828 he added a two- room wing to the southeast end. The east-most room had a brick floor and a large fireplace, likely meaning this room became the new kitchen. Some commentators describe this wing as the oldest or original part of the home. But structural clues strongly suggest that it was built later. Basil Spalding, Jr. died in 1828 and his property was divided between his two sons in approximately 1838. His son John took Pleasant Hill. * The third modification took place during John's ownership, between 1838 and 1848. During this time, John added a second floor to the original two-room portion of the house and the first room of Basil Jr.'s addition. John also added two-story porches to the front and back of the home along the length of the two-room main block. The front porch remains. The back porch is believed to have been demolished in the early 20th century after it became structurally unsound. During John's time at Pleasant Hill, he operated a store and post office from the property.Ibid. The inventory of John's estate indicate that he was a slave- holder, owning 19 slaves.Ibid. at 133 John died in 1848. * This was the fourth phase in the construction of Pleasant Hill. From approximately 1992 to 1995, Don and Beth added a two-story wing to the west end of the house, consisting of a one-room basement, kitchen, and second-floor bedroom.\\"The Greens, Spaldings and Mudds,\\" undated, author unknown, monograph believed to be part of original application for Historic Register nomination. On file at Pleasant Hill. The new wing was connected to the older portion of the house by a hyphen which connected to a new, glass-enclosed, two-story porch where the original porch had been located.

Gonpo Tseten Rinpoche (1906‚Äì1991) was a Dzogchen master, author, painter, sculptor, and teacher of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. Biography G√∂npo Tseten was born in 1906 in Amdo, the eastern province of Tibet, into a family of ngakpas. At the age of seven he was sent to Sangchen Mingye Ling, a Nyingmapa monastery. At the age of 15, having been identified as a potential future teacher, he studied with Kargi Tert√∂n and accomplished the preliminary practices of Tibetan Buddhism. At Sangchen Mingye Ling, G√∂npo Tseten continued his Dharma studies and the traditional Tibetan arts and sciences. Around this time he began to display abilities in drawing, painting, and sculpture. In 1925, at the age of 18, he completed two images of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara, each over six feet tall. He then travelled twenty days in order to study for a year with the Tert√∂n Choling Tuching Dorje, a disciple of Dodrupchen Rinpoche. He subsequently spent four months receiving the transmission and empowerments of the Rinchen Terdzod from the great Dzogchen master Bathur Khenpo Thubten Ch√∂phel, who was also a guru of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and the 6th Dzogchen Rinpoche. Later, the ngakpa G√∂npo Tsering taught him Tu, the art of overcoming enemies. This was essential since his gompa in Amdo needed protection from surrounding afflictions, including ruthless bandits and wild animals. After this, he studied sutra and tantra, including the Y√∂nten Dz√∂, at Sukchen Tago Gompa in Golok, which was established by the First Dodrupchen Rinpoche in 1799. His student Ngawang Khedup, who studied with Lama G√∂npo in Clement Town, Dhera Dun, India, and accompanied him when he went to the United States, reported that among the other places G√∂npo Tseten studied in his youth was Rabgon Ngakmang, \\"the place of many Tantrikas\\", one of Tibet's tantric colleges, where the most secret yogic practices were taught in depth and practiced to completion. At the end of the tummo course, as a test of their accomplishment, the students went to the deep holes dug in the ground behind the buildings on a cold winter's night. The student would then go down to the bottom of a hole and see how many wet blankets could be dried out in a single night by inner heat. The students would also see how far that they could ascend into the air above the hole, to discover which among them could rise up the highest. \\"I was told,\\" Ngawang wrote, \\"that people standing at a distance away could see Lama G√∂npo rising above, not just the other yogis, but also the row of buildings that were in front!\\" Having himself brought tantric siddhis to fruition, Lama G√∂npo emphasized to his students that such outward signs must be the fruit of inner realization rather than goals in themselves. In 1932 he met his root guru, the Longchen Nyingtik lineage holder Patrul Rinpoche Kunzang Shenpen √ñzer of Ts√∂, the tulku of Patrul Rinpoche Ch√∂kyi Wangpo, who was himself a heart-son of Adzom Drukpa Drodul Pawo Dorje. According to the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, in his autobiography Brilliant Moon, Patrul Rinpoche of Ts√∂ was an emanation of Avalokiteshvara and a very unusual person who would feed hundreds of beggars at his monastery upon condition that they enter the gate of the Dharma and undertake ng√∂ndro preliminary practices. Under his guru's direction he did Rich√∂, a solitary mountain retreat, for four years including ng√∂ndro, tsa-lung and Dzogchen progressing through the stages of the path to the realization of the supreme state. At the end of his retreat Patrul Rinpoche of Ts√∂ asked him to teach others and, in 1936, he was given the role of vajra acharya to teach Patrul Rinpoche's disciples in the master's absence. As well, he was given the knowledge-holder name Rigdzin Trinl√© √ñzer. For two years he taught tsa-lung and Dzogchen at Patrul Rinpoche's monastery in Ts√∂. He then did further retreat for one year to deepen his realization before going to Dzogchen Monastery in 1939 and 1940. Lama G√∂npo then returned to his own gompa, Sangchen Mingye Ling, bringing with him the Kangyur, Rigdzin Jigm√© Lingpa's Ton Bum, Yonden Subdon, and other profound texts totaling 1,552 pages. At Sangchen Mingye Ling he became khenpo, and also did another several years in retreat. Converting his monastery to one which concentrated on the Longchen Nyingtik teachings of Rigdzin Jigm√© Lingpa he would teach the Kunzang Lam√© Shyalung of Patrul Ch√∂kyi Wangpo. In the winter he taught tsa-lung, and in the summer, Yeshe Lama. His fame spread far and wide like the rays of the sun. Numerous lamas asked him to teach at their gompas. He taught at eight monasteries throughout Amdo, teaching twice a year at each. From 1957 to 1959 he taught at the renowned Tsering Jong Monastery of Kunkhyen Jigme Lingpa himself near Lhasa. In 1959, Lama G√∂npo managed to escape from Tibet. Having arrived in India, Lama G√∂npo steadfastly continued to teach the Dharma far and wide, and received numerous teachings from other exiled teachers. There, he wrote a compact edition of the Kunzang Lam√© Shyalung. To dispel obstacles, he did a three-month retreat on Vajrakilaya at the residence of the Dalai Lama. At the end of his retreat the Dalai Lama presented him with an offering of a phurba hidden as a terma treasure by Padmasambhava, Guru Rinpoche, and discovered by the great terton Nyang Ral Nyima √ñzer (1124‚Äì1192), the first of the five sovereign terma revealers. Much later, since no material object was important to him in the least unless it could serve the dharma, due to his foreknowledge, at the appropriate time before he departed for the Copper- Coloured Mountain in 1991, Lama G√∂npo transferred this precious artifact to a generous benefactor and gave all of the large donation he received to help fund the community of nuns he was guiding in Amdo. From 1967 to 1978 Lama G√∂npo taught at the Nyingmapa Lamas College at Clement Town, Dehra Dun, India, teaching the entire range of the preliminary and advanced practices. In 1979 Lama G√∂npo was requested to come and teach in the United States by Gyatrul Rinpoche. From 1979 to early 1982, accompanied by his consort Pema Lhanzam, he taught mainly in California, where he taught almost the entire Longchen Nyingtig cycle, including the Yeshe Lama to his devoted students. He was particularly skillful in his guidance of disciples, and could be very gentle, paternal, warm, and encouraging or forthrightly challenging, always expecting those who studied with him to make the greatest possible effort in their practice. Once, after the appearance of unmistakable signs, Lama G√∂npo told a disciple, \\"You are definitely the incarnation of a yogi in Tibet who did a certain Dorje Phurba practice.\\" When the student asked if it were possible to discover more about this, his teacher casually replied, \\"Of course, but inquiring into past lives is not important for most people. It takes away attention from the key point. The key point for is to bring to fulfillment the practice in this very lifetime.\\" A few days thereafter the vidyadhara bestowed the necessary empowerments on the student in order for him to continue the path his teacher had identified. While in America, Lama G√∂npo was an inexhaustible river of extensive empowerments and teachings on every level of the Longchen Nyingtig, from teachings on the Nine Yanas, to Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa's ky√©rim text Staircase to Akanishtha, to one of the first comprehensive Ch√∂ empowerments and teachings given in North America, Laughter of the Dakinis, Phowa, Shitro, Rigdzin D√ºpa, among many others, as well as teachings on the nature of mind, both Semd√© (Mind Category) and Longd√© (Space Category) all the way up to and including the unsurpassed Yeshe Lama, all transmitted from the perspective of highest Dzogchen Atiyoga. When the Chinese government allowed exiled Tibetans to return in 1982 Lama G√∂npo, despite the fact that he had attained the age of 76, courageously returned to Amdo, the region of his birth, and gathered a dedicated community of practitioners, who were mainly nuns, to help in the revival of the Dharma in the Land of Snows. After visiting America once more for a brief period, Lama G√∂npo remained in Tibet until his death at the age of 85. Before Lama G√∂npo left the USA the first time, at a final interview with one of his students, who was himself embarking on the path of a spiritual teacher, the disciple humbly requested his root guru, \\"This is the last time we will meet in this life. What are your essential instructions for me?\\" The great vidyadhara answered simply, \\"Always teach pure dharma, and always rest in rigpa.\\" In these two phrases Lama G√∂npo Tseten set forth a succinct and accurate description of his own life and teaching. Lama G√∂npo Tseten was deeply humble and comfortable in all situations, both high and low, and was immune to praise or blame. He had no interest in founding organizations or building dharma centers and so left that activity for other masters to accomplish. Although he himself possessed unimpeded insight and had the power to authoritatively recognize and enthrone tulkus, which he occasionally did as he foresaw would be helpful, Lama G√∂npo did not consider his own enthronement as a reincarnate master to be necessary and so dispensed with that formality. As were Choje Longchen Rabjam, Kunkhyen Jigme Lingpa, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Gonpo Tseten Rinpoche was considered to be a secret emanation of Panchen Vimalamitra, who brought the Dzogchen teachings to Tibet. This fact is alluded to in his long life prayer, written by H.E. Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche of Pemak√∂: > Of the millions of knowledge-holders The chief is the Supreme Vimalamitra, > Whose light-ray sunlike activity you invite as guests Into the lotus-like > Wisdom Mansion of your heart. Glorious teacher Rigdzin Trinley Ozer, may you > live long. The Dzogpa Chenpo is the Dakinis' luminous heart-essence, The > Supreme Dharma's excellent activity spread widely like pollen. May your > fortunate disciples gathering like bees to honey, Fly in the Dharmakaya's > sky. Although he had planned to depart this world on the tenth day of the sixth Tibetan month, that day being special to Guru Rinpoche, Lama G√∂npo kindly acceded to his students' request and delayed his departure three days. Like Kunzang Sherab the 1st Throneholder of Palyul, and Terdak Lingpa the founder of Mindrolling Monastery, just before his parinirvana the Vidyadhara Trinl√© √ñzer, as he had predicted, saw the dakinis coming to convey his consciousness to the Copper-Coloured Mountain, Guru Rinpoche's pure land. Lama G√∂npo made beautiful inviting mudras as his physical body was dying, and passed into the sphere of ultimate truth on the 13th day of the sixth Tibetan month in the Iron-Sheep Year of the 17th Rabjung, 1991. Lama G√∂npo mentioned in 1981 that he would not reincarnate as a conventional tulku, but would send emanations directly from the Copper Colored Mountain. Personal life About the age of twenty he married and had a son, Pema Rigdzin. After two years he and his wife separated. He later married again, this time to Drolma Chi, with whom he spent the remainder of his time in Tibet until 1959. Three years before the Chinese army arrived, he moved to Lhasa with his wife and son. During the Chinese invasion of Tibet, G√∂npo Tseten became separated from his wife and son, who did not escape. Writings Some writings of Lama G√∂npo Tseten Rinpoche (published under the name Gonpo Tseten): *Dorje Phurba: Developing and Completion Stage Practice (1962), *Preliminary Practices of the Longchen Nyingtik: a Commentary (1964), *Tsa-Lung: Completion Stage Practice (1966), *Life History of the Longchen Nyingtig Lamas: Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa (1979), *In Praise of Longchenpa (1979), *The Life of Guru Rinpoche and the Meaning of the Tsog Offering (1981), *Kye Rim: A Developing Stage Practice of Rigdzin Dupa, and *Yonten Tso: a Comprehensive Nyingtig Text. In addition to his own writings, in 1977 Lama G√∂npo Tseten Rinpoche also published in Gangtok the following texts by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo: *Immortal Celebration: the Empowerment Liturgy of the Text ‚ÄúExtracting the Essence for Prolonging Longevity\\" (a terma of the Fifth Dalai Lama), *A Rough List of Scholars and Translators of Tibet, the Land of Snow, *A Brief Account of the Throneholders of Both New and Old Tantric Schools of the Land of Snow: The Wondrous Lotus Garden. Artistic accomplishments Among Lama G√∂npo Tseten's artistic works are two murals in Clement Town, Dhera Dun, India: \\"Amitabha in Dewachen\\" at Tashi Gommo Gelugpa Monastery, and \\"Mount Meru and the Universe System\\" at the Nyingmapa Lamas College. He also painted a large thangka of the Longchen Nyingtik Refuge Tree and smaller thangkas of Padmasambhava and Vajrakilaya, some of which he gave to Thinley Norbu Rinpoche. Subsequently, the main figure of Guru Rinpoche of Lama G√∂npo's painting was used as the cover for the Padmakara Translation Group's translation of White Lotus by the 1st Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche.

Core architecture data model (CADM) in enterprise architecture is a logical data model of information used to describe and build architectures.Architecture Needed to Guide Modernization of DOD‚Äôs Financial Operations. GOA May 2001. The CADM is essentially a common database schema, defined within the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework DoDAF. It was initially published in 1997 as a logical data model for architecture data.DoD (2003). DoDAF 1.0 Deskbook 15 Aug 2003.  Overview  Core architecture data model (CADM) is designed to capture DoDAF architecture information in a standardized structure. CADM was developed to support the data requirements of the DoDAF. The CADM defines the entities and relationships for DoDAF architecture data elements that enable integration within and across architecture descriptions. In this manner, the CADM supports the exchange of architecture information among mission areas, components, and federal and coalition partners, thus facilitating the data interoperability of architectures. CADM is a critical aspect of being able to integrate architectures in conformance with DoDAF. This includes the use of common data element definitions, semantics, and data structure for all architecture description entities or objects. The use of the underlying CADM faithfully relates common objects across multiple views. Adherence with the framework, which includes conformance with the currently approved version of CADM, provides both a common approach for developing architectures and a basic foundation for relating architectures. Conformance with the CADM ensures the use of common architecture data elements (or types).  History  The CADM was initially published in 1997 as a logical data model for architecture data. It was revised in 1998 to meet all the requirements of the C4ISR Architecture Framework Version 2.0.1 As a logical data model, the initial CADM provided a conceptual view of how architecture information is organized. It identified and defined entities, attributes, and relations. The CADM has evolved since 1998, so that it now has a physical view providing the data types, abbreviated physical names, and domain values that are needed for a database implementation. Because the CADM is also a physical data model, it constitutes a database design and can be used to automatically generate databases. The CADM v1.01 was released with the DoD Architecture Framework v1.0 in August 2003. This DoDAF version restructured the C4ISR Framework v2.0 to offer guidance, product descriptions, and supplementary information in two volumes and a desk book. It broadened the applicability of architecture tenets and practices to all mission areas rather than just the C4ISR community. This document addressed usage, integrated architectures, DoD and Federal policies, value of architecture, architecture measures, DoD decision support processes, development techniques, analytical techniques, and the CADM v1.01, and moved towards a repository-based approach by placing emphasis on architecture data elements that comprise architecture products.DoD (2007). DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.5 Volume 1. 23 April 2007 The CADM v1.5 was pre-released with the DoD Architecture Framework, v1.5 in April 2007. The DoDAF v1.5 was an evolution of the DoDAF v1.0 and reflects and leverages the experience that the DoD components have gained in developing and using architecture descriptions. This transitional version provided additional guidance on how to reflect net- centric concepts within architecture descriptions, includes information on architecture data management and federating architectures through the department, and incorporates the pre-release CADM v1.5, a simplified model of previous CADM versions that includes net-centric elements. Pre-release CADM v1.5 is also backward compatible with previous CADM versions. Data sets built in accordance with the vocabulary of CADM v1.02/1.03 can be expressed faithfully and completely using the constructs of CADM v1.5. Note: For DoDAF V2.0, The DoDAF Meta-model (DM2) is working to replace the core architecture data model (CADM) which supported previous versions of the DoDAF. DM2 is a data construct that facilitates reader understanding of the use of data within an architecture document. CADM can continue to be used in support of architectures created in previous versions of DoDAF.  Topics  = Building blocks = The major elements of a core architecture data model are described as follows: * Core : The essential elements of architecture information that need to be developed, validated, and maintained and that should be sharable across architecture concerns to achieve architecture goals (e.g., interoperability, investment optimization). * Architecture data : The possible piece-parts of architecture products and related analytical tools in a rigorous definition of the pieces (object classes), their properties, features, or attributes, and inter-relationships. * Data model: A data model defines the objects of a domain, their inter-relationships, and their properties, normally for the purpose of a database design. There are three data model levels, from highest to lowest: conceptual, logical, and physical. Conceptual data models are the highest level. They model the user concepts in terms familiar to users. Details may be left out to improve clarity and focus with users. Logical models are more formal, often with considerations of unique data representation (non-redundancy or database normalization), emphasis on semantic well-definedness and exclusivity (nonoverlapping entities), and domain-level completeness. Logical data models need not commit to a specific Data Base Management System (DBMS). Physical data models are usually the most detailed and the level sufficient for database generation. The Physical model must contain all the information necessary for implementation. The Physical model often addresses performance considerations. = Data modeling and visualization = The DoDAF incorporates data modeling (CADM) and visualization aspects (products and views) to support architecture analysis. The DoDAF's data model, CADM, defines architecture data entities, the relationships between them, and the data entity attributes, essentially specifying the ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù for the architecture community. It contains a set of ‚Äúnouns,‚Äù ‚Äúverbs,‚Äù and ‚Äúadjectives‚Äù that, together with the ‚Äúgrammar,‚Äù allow one to create ‚Äúsentences‚Äù about architecture artifacts that are consistent with the DoDAF. The CADM is a necessary aspect of the architecture and provides the meaning behind the architectural visual representations (products). It enables the effective comparing and sharing of architecture data across the enterprise, contributing to the overall usefulness of architectures. The CADM describes the following data model levels in further detail: * Conceptual : Models the user concepts in terms familiar to users * Logical : More formal model that considers unique data representation, emphasis on semantic well-defineness and exclusivity, and domain-level completeness * Physical : Models all the information necessary for database implementation Data visualization is a way of graphically or textually representing architecture data to support decision-making analysis. The DoDAF provides products as a way of representing the underlying data in a user- friendly manner. In some cases, the existing DoDAF products are sufficient for representing the required information. Regardless of how one chooses to represent the architecture description, the underlying data (CADM) remains consistent, providing a common foundation to which analysis requirements are mapped. = Data model diagram notation. = CADM Data Model Diagram Notation. As illustrated in the figure, boxes represent entities for which architecture data are collected (representing tables when used for a relational database); they are depicted by open boxes with square corners (independent entities) or rounded corners (dependent entities). The entity name is outside and on top of the open box. The lines of text inside the box denote the attributes of that entity (representing columns in the entity table when used for a relational database). The horizontal line in each box separates the primary key attributes (used to find unique instances of the entity) from the non-key descriptive attributes.DoD Architecture Framework Working Group (2003). DoDAF 1.5 Volume 2, 15 August 2003. The symbol with a circle and line underneath indicates subtyping, for which all the entities connected below are non- overlapping subsets of the entity connected at the top of the symbol. Relationships are represented by dotted (non-identifying) and solid (identifying) relationships in which the child entity (the one nearest the solid dot) has zero, one, or many instances associated to each instance of the parent entity (the other entity connected by the relationship line). = Basic architectural elements = An architecture data repository responsive to the architecture products of the DoDAF contains information on basic architectural elements such as the following: CADM Architecture Concepts Model. * Operational nodes may be organizations, organization types, and operational (human) roles. (A role may be a skill, occupation, occupational specialty, or position.). * Operational activities including tasks defined in the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL). * Information and data refers to information provided by domain databases and other information asset sources (which may be network centric) and systems data that implement that information. These information sources and systems data may define information exchanges or details for system interfaces. * Systems nodes refers to nodes associated with physical entities as well as systems and may be facilities, platforms, units,3 or locations. * Systems include families of systems (FOSs) and systems of systems (SOSs) and contain software and hardware equipment items. * System functions are required by operational activities and are performed by one or more systems. * Performance refers to performance characteristics of systems, system functions, links (i.e., physical links), computer networks, and system data exchanges. * Standards are associated with technologies, systems, systems nodes, and data, and refer to technical standards for information processing, information transfer, data, security, and human computer interface. * Technologies include future technologies and relates to systems and emerging standards concerning the use of such technologies. The depicted (conceptual) relationships shown in this diagram include the following (among many others): * Operational nodes perform many operational activities. * Operational nodes require information. * Information are related to systems and implemented as data, which is associated with standards. * Systems perform system functions. * Systems have performance characteristics; both systems and performance may relate to a system function being performed. With these relationships, many types of architectural and related information can be represented such as networks, information flows, information requirements, interfaces, and so forth. = Related models = The counterpart to CADM within NASA is the NASA Exploration Information Ontology Model (NeXIOM), which is designed to capture and expressively describe the engineering and programmatic data that drives exploration program decisions.

Model genetic species, such as D.melanogaster (common fruit fly) and Apis mellifera (honey bee), have been rigorously studied and proven to be instrumental in developing the science of genetics. Many examples of genetic factors of social behavior have been derived from a bottom-up method of altering a gene and observing the change it produces in an organism. Sociogenomics is an integrated field that accounts for the complete cellular genetic complement of an organism from a top-down approach, accounting for all biotic influences that effect behavior on a cellular level. Sociogenomics Sociogenomics, a subdiscipline of genomics, is an integrative approach to behavioral biology that compares genomic data to behavioral phenotype. Of particular interest are differential gene expression of mRNA (transcriptomics) and protein transcription (proteomics) that correspond to changes in behavior. Data of this sort is especially useful when comparing the genomic qualities of organisms with varying degrees of social organization.Robinson GE, Grozinger CM, Whitfield CW (2005). \\"Social life in molecular terms\\". Nature Genetics Reviews 6, 257-270. While sociogenomics integrates more fields of study and is more encompassing than classical genetics, the methodology is still considered forward genetics. The goal is to determine genes or sets of genes and their artifacts that contribute to the expression of a phenotype. =Eusociality= Sociogenomic methodology has been applied to understanding the biology of eusociality include its cellular origin, caste determination in a eusocial hierarchy, and the mechanisms that mediate division of labor. Efforts in genome sequencing have allowed researchers to examine eusocial insect behavior from a molecular perspective. Notable progress in this field was made by the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium, led by Gene E. Robinson, which published and made public a completed honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome in October 2006.Honeybee Genome Sequencing Consortium. \\"Insights into social insects from the genome of the honeybee Apis mellifera\\". Nature 2006 Oct 26; 443(7114):931-4. Completion of the honey bee genome and other model organism genomes has made further between-species sociogenomic comparisons possible. Honey Bee To examine higher insect social order, researchers looked into the potential evolutionary history of a ‚Äúforaging gene‚Äù in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Honey bees have a several week lifespan divided between two phases‚Äîone spent caring for the hive, the other spent foraging. The regulation of social foraging is important to maintain division of labor, requisite of eusocial organization. In order to discover how foraging in bees is genetically encoded, the honey bee genome was searched for genes that may be shared by other species. A molecular basis for feeding behavior has been determined in Drosophila melanogaster, which shares a common insect ancestor. The ‚Äúforaging gene‚Äù in D. melanogaster encodes a cGMP mediated protein kinase (PKG). Naturally occurring allelic variation produces behavioral syndromes in D. melanogaster, both ‚Äúsitters‚Äù and ‚Äúrovers‚Äù. The needs of a honey bee colony are communicated between bees by pheromones, chemical signals which trigger behavioral responses. Honey bees have a variant of the same foraging gene that controls the onset of foraging behavior. Elevated expression of this gene correlates with increased foraging activity; precocious foraging was induced in young workers by experimentally introducing PKG. Further clues to the genetic origins of eusociality have been derived by comparing quality of genomic processes. Also applying to A. mellifera; by looking at the degree of genetic linkage and chromosomal recombination rates, light may be shed on the consequence of group selection on a eusocial insect colony. Within the Order Hymenoptera, primitively and highly eusocial species tend to have greater gene linkage and significantly higher more DNA recombination events than non-social species. This trend continues within groups of eusocial species, highly eusocial species have highly recombinant genomes. While contested, recombination activity might originate from the influence of group selection acting on developing eusocial organization in haplodiploids, where colonies that can best maintain a stable coefficient of relatedness are favored.Gadau J, et al (1999). Genome organization and social evolution in Hymenoptera. Naturwissenschaften 87: 87-89 An early study also determined the cellular basis of the discrete caste morphology of A. mellifera. Queens arise when workers in a colony selectively feed chosen larvae royal jelly. The caste differentiation occurs through an epigenetic process; non-heritable factors contributing to gene expression. Queen and worker morphological forms both come occur from the same genome, royal jelly nourishment is the non-genetic determiner. The pathway to queen morphs is through increased mRNA translation in the cytosol. Biogenesis of organelles occurs at the same rate in both types of larvae, as evidenced by the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. Special feeding leads to an increase of metabolic rate for larval queen to facilitate the energy requirement to develop their larger body size.Corona M, Estrada E, Zurita M (1999). \\"Differential expression of mitochondrial genes between queens and workers during caste determination in the honeybee Apis mellifera\\". J. Exp. Biol. 202: 929-938 Social influences on gene expression In songbirds, egr1 is a transcription factor encoding gene that is active in the auditory forebrain when hearing a song from another songbird. The strength of the expression of egr1 has much variability, dependent on the nature of the song. Songs previously unheard result in strong responses whereas familiar songs result in little or no response. Pure tones or white noise do not evoke any response. It is thought that the purpose of this genetic response to social stimuli is to update the brain's catalog of the changing natural environment. For example, it would be advantageous for a songbird to express more egr1 in a situation where there is a new song heard (a potential intruder) compared to the familiar song of a known individual. In contrast, for the species of highly social cichlid fish A. burtoni, the egr1 gene plays an indirect role in reproduction. In this species, there is an established social dominance hierarchy and an individual's position determines their access to resources for reproduction. If the alpha male is removed from the group, a previous subordinate starts exhibiting dominant behavior and egr1 is expressed in hypothalamus neurons that are responsible for producing a neuropeptide linked to sexual reproduction. Overall, the role of transcription factor egr1 in the context of social behavior clearly shows the link between genes and behavior. As a corollary to that described above, given an environmental cue egr1 will induce or suppress the transcription of other genes. Egr1 shows how social experience may trigger changes in the brain's gene networks. With higher capacity screening techniques, the expression of many genes simultaneously in response to social stimuli will provide a more complete picture.Robinson, G.E. et al. (2008) \\"Genes and Social Behavior\\". Science 322, (896-899) Neurobiology of mating decisions The neurobiology of drosophila mating behavior is an area of research that has studied in detail and has elucidated the genetic basis for behavior. The male courts a female based on pheromones from the female and previous experience courting other potential mates. The female accepts or rejects the male's courtship also based on pheromones, the acoustics of his courtship song, and her readiness to mate. The mating behavior of drosophila had been described almost a century ago, and the genetics of these behaviors have been studied for several decades. The current interest in neurobiology is trying to understand the neural circuits that provide the basis of action selection‚Äîhow the brain maps sensory input, internal states, and individual experience to behavioral decisions. The pathways that govern the mapping of pheromones to the brain of drosophila are beginning to be understood in detail. Pheromones are detected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). A well-studied pheromone is cVA, which suppresses male courtship behavior when the male detects it from a female. cVA complexes with other proteins to form a ligand, which binds to the odorant receptor Or67d present in OSNs, which is specific for cVA. In turn, the OSNs grow axons that will connect to the glomerulus DA1 in the antennal lobe, which is analogous to the olfactory bulb in mammals. This glomerulus then connects to DA1 projection neurons (PNs) which relay the pheromone signal further to higher brain centers in the protocerebrum (anterior part of an arthropod brain). It is noteworthy that there is significant neuronal convergence taking place between the OSNs and PNs‚Äîabout 50 OSN inputs to 4 PNs. Another pathway that has been studied is that involving another odorant receptor called Or47b, which is connected to the VA1v glomerulus. Its respective pathway conveys pheromones from odors in both sexes, and when the genetics of the involved neurons is changed, male courtship is delayed. As a simple model, one would view the integration of the Or67d/DA1 and Or47b/VA1v pathways as a way to describe the initiation of mating behavior in drosophila. The former will tend to inhibit male courtship, whereas the latter is thought to stimulate mating. It is thought that the difference in the fru gene causes the bulk of the distinction in sexual differentiation in neural circuits. Although the sensory and motor circuits are nearly identical in both sexes, the fru gene fine tunes these according to the needs of either sex. There is learning taking place when a male engages in courtship behavior. A male learns by experience, after courtship rejection by females that have already mated he learns not to pursue other mated females. Similarly, courtship of receptive virgin females is learned after past mating successes. The mushroom bodies are a probable site for this experience-dependent modulation of pheromones, as disrupting fru in neurons in this area reduces short term courtship behavior. Long term courtship is suppressed by the presence of certain proteins in this region of the brain.Dickson, B.J. et al. (2008) \\"Wired for Sex: The Neurobiology of Drosophila Mating Decisions\\". Science 322, (904-908) For females, the decision whether to mate or not when courted by a male largely depends on the courtship song. Analogous to OSNs, the female's Johnston's organ neurons (JONs) distinguish the quality of the song, and a distinct mechanical stimuli projects signals to specific regions of the brain, which can lead to mating. The reluctance for a female to mate again after having mated before has a molecular basis. In the male Drosophila ejaculate, there is a sex peptide (SP) which binds to the sex peptide receptor (SRP) in the female's fru neurons, disrupting pathways that would compel the female to mate again. Future research in this area hopes to further explain how the chemical and auditory signals are processed and mapped to behaviors in the fly's brain. Though the molecular mechanisms in the pathways vary between mammals and insects, it has been shown that the information is processed in similar ways. The relative simplicity of fly nervous systems could eventually hint at how neural circuits solve complex behavioral decision making. Effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on animal behavior In the past few decades, it has been discovered that oxytocin and vasopressin neuropeptides have key roles in the regulation of social cognition and behavior in mammals. Although homologs have been discovered which are pervasive across many taxa which have similar roles in social and reproductive behaviors, the specific influenced behaviors are quite diverse. For example, in snails the homolog for oxytocin/vasopressin conopressin modulates ejaculation in males and egg laying in females. On the other hand, for vertebrates there is sexual dimorphism in the neuropeptides‚Äîoxytocin induces maternal behavior in females and vasopressin induces territoriality, aggression and reproduction in males. In sheep, oxytocin has another effect on a female in addition to a generalized increase in maternal behavior‚Äîit induces mother-infant bond selectivity by priming the mother's olfactory bulb, and the mother selectively learns the offspring's scent. An insightful study of vasopressin is its role in the stimulation of monogamous behavior. The V1a vasopressin receptor gene is a mechanism most widely studied. Different species of voles were studied, prairie voles which are monogamous in nature and montane voles, which tend towards polygamy. Using viral vector mediated gene expression, which allows the cross-species transplanting of genes, when the V1a receptor expression was increased in the reward and reinforcement neural circuitry of montane voles, they acquired a more selective preference for their mate. Their behavior became more akin to that of prairie voles. Therefore, it is alteration of vasopressin receptor gene expression patterns is thought to affect social behavior, rather than the neuropeptide itself. A proposed mechanism for the difference in these patterns is the variation of microsatellite DNA length that is upstream of the V1a receptor gene‚Äîshort microsatellite DNA in the 5' flanking region of the gene has a different effect on prairie vole behavior than longer microsatellite DNA. Whether this is a mechanism that is replicable in the wild is uncertain.Donaldson, Z.R. et al. (2008) \\"Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and the Neurogenetics of Sociality\\".

She was the first woman to graduate from the professional architecture program at the University of Washington and was the first woman to be registered as an architect in Washington State. Ayer was born in Thurston County, Washington, in October 1897. She enrolled at the University of Washington in 1916, graduating in 1921 with her B.Arch. degree. In 1919, while still a student, she was hired by Andrew Willatsen. The next year she began her long association with Seattle architect Edwin Ivey. From 1922 to 1923 she worked in New York City, but after a year returned to Seattle, again working with Ivey. By the late 1920s, Ayer was identified as Ivey's \\"Associate.\\" During the 1920s and 1930s, Ayer played key roles in design and supervision of the Ivey's residential commissions. About 1930, Ayer became registered as an architect in Washington State. In 1940, Ivey was killed in an automobile accident. Ayer took over the firm and with another employee, Rolland Lamping, continued the practice. In 1942, they suspended the practice‚Äîfor the duration of World War II Ayer worked as an architect in the U.S. Engineers Office. She restarted the practice after 1945. Some time during the 1950s, the firm name was changed to Ayer & Lamping. Ayer retired in 1970, after a 50-year professional career.

History CLWR was founded in March 1946 by Lutherans in Canada who wished to respond to refugee and relief needs following the Second World War. This facilitated the sending of clothing, bedding, blankets, and food to displaced persons in Europe. Also, thousands of refugees were assisted in finding a new home in Canada.[see Grams] Current Scope of Work  Development work is focused in Zambia, Mozambique, India, Bolivia and Peru. A small scale irrigation program is operated in Ethiopia through Canadian Foodgrains Bank, of which CLWR is a founding member. Relief commodities are shipped to where needed most and to where they can be most effectively transported, this being primarily in Africa. Recent shipments have been directed to Mauritania, Zambia, and Tanzania. Refugees come from Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. =Community Development= Community development is undertaken in partnership with the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), with support funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/CIDAWEB/acdicida.nsf/En/FRA-1124132537-PM3 \\"Main CIDA Partners\\" and donations from individual supporters. CLWR works with other local partners in Bolivia and Peru as well as in Ethiopia, where food- for-work programs assist communities in constructing water projects. In all project countries, goals include food security, economic development, environmental protection, gender equality, organizational strengthening, and HIV and AIDS prevention. CLWR recognizes the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals in planning community development. =Refugee Resettlement= Since 1979, CLWR has sponsored refugees as an official Sponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH) with the Government of Canada. Each year, roughly one hundred refugees are resettled by CLWR into Canada. CLWR's Toronto and Vancouver offices administer the refugee program. =Emergency Relief= CLWR responds to natural and human disasters in partnership with other members of the international aid networks of the LWF and Action by Churches Together (ACT) International. 100 percent of all donations designated for emergency response measures are forwarded for relief activities; CLWR retains no portion for administration costs.http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2008/19/c6294.html \\"CNW Group news release - Aid agency, CLWR, calls for more support for relief efforts in Haiti following Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike\\" =Basic Commodity Shipments - We Care Kits and Quilts= Through the We Care program, thousands of donated kits and quilts are delivered annually into situations of need around the world. We Care kits are assembled by individuals and groups who are interested in supporting this part of CLWR's work. Kits contain clothing, hygiene products, school supplies, sewing goods and more. =International Volunteer Service= CLWR offers volunteer opportunities in developing countries across Latin America, Africa and Asia. The duration of these placements range from six months to two years and are organized in cooperation with partner organizations in the country of destination. Often the partner is the LWF. The variety of work is broad and is based on the skills of the volunteers and the needs of the host organization. =Working in Alliance= CLWR is a member of ACT Development, a global alliance of churches and related agencies working on development that are committed to working together.

Design The bridges are typically reinforced concrete barrel arches with uncoursed stone facing on the sides, in a National Park Service Rustic style. The concrete is not visible to passersby, whose attention is taken by the mass of the masonry. Of the two, the Clover Creek bridge is the more impressive, due to its setting. The bridges were designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs in cooperation with the Bureau of Public Roads. The design inspiration for the bridges was the Westchester County, New York parkway system, which included the Bronx River and Hutchinson River parkways. The National Park Service sent two designers to observe the construction, and one of these, John Wosky, was the designer of the Generals' Highway bridges. Wosky developed the architectural design of the Marble Fork bridge in the fall of 1928, and structural plans were developed by the Bureau of Public Roads in January 1929.

His son David Leavitt II served as private in Capt. Thomas Bull's Company of Major Elisha Sheldon's Regiment, Connecticut Light Horse, from September to December 1776. The ambitious David Leavitt Jr. left rural Connecticut in 1813 at age 22 for New York City, where he began his career as a clerk in a produce and commission house. Three years later Leavitt's father died and, after inheriting a share of the elder Leavitt's estate, the son David Leavitt set himself up as a New York merchant and financier.Joining David Leavitt as New York City merchants were his cousins from Litchfield County, Connecticut, John Wheeler Leavitt and Rufus Leavitt. For a while all three flourished. But ultimately the two Leavitt cousins, who were in business together, were declared insolvent, with David Leavitt left as one of their primary creditors. John Wheeler Leavitt was the grandfather of American portrait painter Cecilia Beaux. By 1815, Leavitt had gone into business with David Lee at 133 Front Street in Manhattan in the firm of Leavitt & Lee, wholesalers in the grocery business. By 1820 Leavitt & Lee had moved to 127 Front Street, and shortly afterwards the two partners dissolved their business. Leavitt left the grocery business and decided to set himself up as a financier.Annual Report of the Corporation of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, Press of the Chamber of Commerce, New York, 1896 He decided to go it alone.The Old Merchants of New York City, Walter Barrett, Published by Carleton, New York, 1866 In one of Leavitt's first transactions, he bought an entire cargo of tea which the merchant John Jacob Astor had imported. When the German immigrant Astor inquired of Leavitt how he intended to pay for the cargo, Leavitt produced from his pocket a handful of notes written by Astor on his account, which Leavitt had bought up on the street.David Leavitt, obituary, The New York Times, December 31, 1879 In his next large transactions, the 25-year-old Leavitt again demonstrated his business acumen. The government of Colombia, facing a conflict at home, had paid a group of New York merchants to build a warship and equip it with armaments for use by the South American nation. Ultimately, those building the vessel were unable to complete the transaction, and Leavitt stepped in, paying for the ship's construction, and assuring that the United States government would help arm it with munitions. Leavitt then took command of the vessel, sailing it to South America, where the Colombian government paid him $100,000 in Colombian currency, and an additional $100,000 in a London bank draft. On his way home, Leavitt stopped in Havana, where he converted the Colombian currency into Spanish doubloons, which he converted back into dollars when demand for doubloons soared. The London bank draft finally cleared in its entirety after several years' delay, during which Leavitt bided his time instead of selling the draft at a discount. The entire transaction had netted Leavitt a tidy profit, which he invested in other ventures. In 1823, a local businessman had established a manufactory for white lead in the emerging city of Brooklyn.History of American Manufactures from 1608 to 1860, J. Leander Bishop, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2006 Acting as a lender to the business from its inception, Leavitt stepped in to take control in 1825 and founded the Brooklyn White Lead Company, later Dutch Boy Paint. Much of Leavitt's wealth derived from his early investment in lead manufacturing and importing.The Wealth and Biography of the Wealthy Citizens of the City of New York, Moses Yale Beach, Published at the Sun Office, New York, 1846 Leavitt had already had a home built in Brooklyn, where he took up residence with his wife Maria Clarissa (Lewis), a native of Goshen, Connecticut. At the time of Leavitt's move to Brooklyn, there were only three homes visible from his own, and the New York merchant later bought up large tracts of Brooklyn real estate, and became a trustee of the village of Brooklyn Heights.Portrait Gallery of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, Catalogue and Biographical Sketches, George Wilson (compiler), Press of the Chamber of Commerce, New York, 1890 Letter to New York City banker David Leavitt, representing lenders to the Illinois and Michigan Canal of the opening of the waterway. 10 May 1848 Leavitt also owned and operated the Fulton Street Ferry,As owner of the Fulton Street Ferry, and other businesses on the Brooklyn side of the East River, Leavitt often petitioned the Board of Aldermen of New York for various improvements to the piers and waterfront. until popular sentiment against Leavitt's large monopolies put an end to his ownership. In 1843, Leavitt financed construction of an elegant mansion in Brooklyn Heights, which he sold a decade later to Henry C.

During his tenure at American Exchange, there was a financial panic, during which European bondholders of the State of Illinois declared their intention to foreclose on the bonds issuer. \\"Grave fears were entertained that the bonds would not be paid\\", wrote The New York Times, \\"and several financiers had failed in placing them in the European market, but by pledging his own credit, Mr. Leavitt succeeded in creating a degree of confidence in the scheme, and it was a source of pride to him in after years that all the holders of the bonds eventually received both principal and interest.\\" To reassure the bondholders, Leavitt not only advanced his own funds, but traveled to England to meet jittery European stakeholders. For his role in averting the bond collapse, and allowing construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal to the growing city of Chicago, city elders ultimately named Leavitt Street after the New York financier.History of Chicago, Alfred Theodore Andreas, The Arno Press, 1884 At the opening of the canal in April 1848, Leavitt - and the only other trustee The Illinois and Michigan Canal: A Study in Economic History, Chicago Historical Society's Collection, Vol. X, James William Putnam, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Ill., 1918 of the canal's bondholders who had personally intervened to float the $1.6 million loan to complete the project - were feted at the opening ceremonies.

He served as Receiver of the North American Trust and Banking Company.Reports of Cases in Law and Equity in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Vol. XVII, Oliver L. Barbour, Gould, Banks & Co., Albany, N.Y., 1855 In 1857, during another financial panic which swept the markets, Leavitt took to the steps of the American Exchange Bank building, where he addressed depositors, assuring them the institution would meet its obligations and stemming a run on the bank. By 1861, when The Merchants' and Bankers' Almanac was published by Bankers' Magazine, the portrait of David Leavitt, along with those of George Peabody, Albert Gallatin, Erastus Corning, and Stephen Girard, graced the periodical's cover.The Merchants' Magazine and Commercial Review, Isaac Smith Homans, William Buck, Vol. XLIV, 1861 Leavitt later built a estate called Brookside in the Massachusetts Berkshires at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where he established a gallery for his growing art collection, especially the works of Emanuel Leutze,Washington at Monmouth, American Heritage Magazine, June 1965, Volume 16, issue 4, AmericanHeritage.com from whom Leavitt had commissioned The Battle of Monmouth.Following Leavitt's death, several of the Leutze paintings were bought by Mrs. Mark Hopkins for her collection in San Francisco.

He became only the third American-born player and the first American-trained player to join the National Hockey League. In 1928, Lane was offered by the Rangers to the Bruins for Eddie Shore and $5,000. Rangers president John S. Hammond believed that because Lane was such a hero in his home state, the Bruins would do anything to acquire him. According to former Rangers publicity director Stan Saplin, who got the story from Lester Patrick, the telegram Bruins' president, Charles F. Adams sent back read: GET A LIFE PRESERVER - YOU ARE MYLES FROM SHORE. The Rangers later sold his contract to the Bruins for $7,500. He was with the Bruins when they won the Stanley Cup in 1929.

Over 9,015 regular season games, the Vols compiled a win‚Äìloss record of 4,569‚Äì4,446 (.507). They qualified for postseason playoffs on 16 occasions and had a postseason record of 108‚Äì74 (.593). Nashville won eight SA pennants, nine SA playoff championships, and four Dixie Series titles. Combining all 9,197 regular season and postseason games, the Vols had an all-time record of 4,677‚Äì4,520 (.509). The Nashville Baseball Club was formed as a charter member of the newly organized Southern Association in 1901. The team did not receive its official moniker, the Nashville Volunteers, until 1908. However, the team was, and is, commonly referred to as the Vols. Their last season in the Southern Association was 1961. After sitting out the 1962 season, Nashville returned for a final campaign as a part of the South Atlantic League in 1963. The Vols competed at four class levels: Class B (1901), Class A (1902‚Äì1935), Class A1 (1936‚Äì1945), and Double-A (1946‚Äì1961, 1963). Today, all Minor League Baseball teams are affiliated with a Major League Baseball team to develop players for the major league club. However, it was not until the 1930s that Nashville entered into such major league affiliations on a consistent basis. The Vols were affiliated with eight teams across 29 seasons and were unaffiliated in the other 33 seasons. Their longest affiliation was with the Chicago Cubs for nine seasons (1943‚Äì1951), followed by the Cincinnati Reds/Redlegs (8 seasons; 1936‚Äì1937, 1955‚Äì1960), New York Giants (5 seasons; 1934‚Äì1935, 1952‚Äì1954), Brooklyn Dodgers (3 seasons; 1938‚Äì1940), and one season each with the Cleveland Naps (1908), Minnesota Twins (1961), Chicago White Sox (1920), and Los Angeles Angels (1963). The team's best season record occurred in 1940 when they finished 101‚Äì47 (.682). The 1940 team was ranked as the 47th best minor league of all time in a 2001 ranking by baseball historians. Their lowest season record was 45‚Äì92 (.328) in 1906. Of the eight major league affiliations in Nashville's history, the team recorded its best record from 1938 to 1940 as a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate. The team had a regular season record of 270‚Äì181 (.599) during that time. They reached the postseason in all three seasons, winning two playoff championships and one Dixie Series title. Their postseason record was 25‚Äì16 (.610). Conversely, the team's lowest record was as a Los Angeles Angels affiliate in 1963. The Vols compiled a 53‚Äì86 (.381) record and failed to reach the postseason in their lone year with the Angles and their final year of competition.

The ensemble made several recordings for the RCA Red Seal label. After some 30 years of inactivity, in 2008 Tashi reunited for a tour to celebrate the centenary of Messiaen's birth.  References  Chamber music groups Musical groups established in 1973 Peter Serkin was fascinated by the concept of ‚Äòsound color,‚Äô created by composer Olivier Messiaen. Its history was Messiaen‚Äôs experience in a prisoner of war camp. There he composed Quartet for the End of Time. It was based on the color of visions Messiaen had while suffering internment, and it was written for the only musicians at the camp. Their instruments: cello, clarinet, piano and violin. Serkin was compelled to form a group with those same instruments that would take Messiaen‚Äôs masterpiece forward in time. Once formed, the new quartet needed a name, and the name of Serkin‚Äôs Tibetan Terrier Tashi seemed perfect. Serkin purchased Tashi as a puppy from a Tibetan weaver while in Kathmandu. A Buddhist Lama, responsible for naming children and pets, named Tashi the dog for the Tibetan symbol of good fortune. Thus, the debut record album by the Tashi Quartet has a brightly colored Tibetan painting of this symbol as its cover.

In response to the conspiracy theories, the White House released copies of the President's long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011, and posted an image of it to the White House website, reaffirming that he was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. During Barack Obama's campaign for president in 2008, throughout his presidency, and afterwards, \\"there was extensive news coverage of Obama's religious preference, birthplace, and of the individuals questioning his religious belief and citizenship‚Äîefforts eventually known as the birther movement, by which it is widely referred across media. The movement falsely asserted Obama was ineligible to be President of the United States because he was not a natural-born citizen of the U.S. as required by Article Two of the Constitution. Birther conspiracy theories were predominantly held by conservatives and Republicans, as well as individuals with anti-Black attitudes. Theories alleged that Obama's published birth certificate was a forgery‚Äîthat his actual birthplace was not Hawaii but Kenya. Other theories alleged that Obama became a citizen of Indonesia in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claimed that Obama was not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a dual citizen (British and American). A number of political commentators have characterized these various claims as a racist reaction to Obama's status as the first African-American president of the United States.  These claims were promoted by fringe theorists (pejoratively referred to as \\"birthers\\"), the most prominent among whom was Donald Trump, who would later succeed Obama as president. Some theorists sought court rulings to declare Obama ineligible to take office, or to grant access to various documents which they claimed would support such ineligibility; none of these efforts succeeded. Some political opponents, especially in the Republican Party, expressed skepticism about Obama's citizenship or been unwilling to acknowledge it; some have proposed legislation which would require presidential candidates to provide proof of eligibility. Theories have persisted despite Obama's pre-election release of his official Hawaiian birth certificate in 2008, confirmation by the Hawaii Department of Health based on the original documents, the April 2011 release of a certified copy of Obama's original Certificate of Live Birth (or long- form birth certificate), and contemporaneous birth announcements published in Hawaii newspapers. Polls conducted in 2010 (before the April 2011 release) suggested that at least 25% of adult Americans said that they doubted Obama's U.S. birth, and a May 2011 Gallup poll found that the percentage had fallen to 13% of American adults (23% of Republicans).Obama's Birth Certificate Convinces Some, but Not All, Skeptics , Gallup (May 13, 2011). The fall has been attributed to Obama's release of the long form in April 2011.Welch, Susan et al.

Background =Early life of Barack Obama= People who express doubts about Obama's eligibility or reject details about his early life are often informally called \\"birthers\\", a term that parallels the nickname \\"truthers\\" for adherents of 9/11 conspiracy theories. These conspiracy theorists reject at least some of the following facts about his early life: Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (now called Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children) in Honolulu, Hawaii,Dan Nakaso, \\"Twin sisters, Obama on parallel paths for years\\" , The Honolulu Advertiser, December 22, 2008.

Retrieved June 12, 2010 (archived from the original on July 22, 2011) from Wichita, Kansas, and her husband Barack Obama Sr., a Luo from Nyang'oma Kogelo, Nyanza Province (in what was then the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya), who was attending the University of Hawaii. Birth notices for Barack Obama were published in The Honolulu Advertiser on August 13 and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on August 14, 1961. Obama's father's immigration file also clearly states Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. One of his high school teachers, who was acquainted with his mother at the time, remembered hearing about the day of his birth. Obama's parents were divorced in 1964. He attended kindergarten in 1966‚Äì1967 at Noelani Elementary School in Honolulu. In 1967, his mother married Indonesian student Lolo Soetoro, who was also attending the University of Hawaii, and the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama attended the Catholic St. Francis of Assisi School before transferring to State Elementary School Menteng 01, an elite Indonesian public school in Menteng. As a child in Indonesia, Obama was called \\"Barry\\", sometimes Barry Soetoro, reflecting his stepfather's surname, and sometimes Barry Obama, using his father's surname.Sabarini, Prodita (January 31, 2007). \\"Impish Obama couldn't sit still, says school pal\\" . The Jakarta Post Retrieved January 28, 2014. When he was ten years old, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham, and has resided continuously in the United States since 1971. =Origins of the claims= Conspiracy theories about Obama's religion appeared at least as early as his 2004 U.S. Senate campaign in a press release by Illinois political candidate Andy Martin, and, according to a Los Angeles Times editorial, as Internet rumors. From the start of March 2008, rumors that Obama was born in Kenya before being flown to Hawaii were spread on conservative websites, with the suggestion that this would disqualify Obama from the presidency. In April of that year, some supporters of Hillary Clinton circulated anonymous chain emails repeating the same rumor; among them was an Iowa campaign volunteer, who was fired when the story emerged. These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion, and birth certificate. On June 9, 2008, Jim Geraghty of the conservative website National Review Online suggested that Obama release his birth certificate.Geraghty, Jim (June 9, 2008). \\"Obama Could Debunk Some Rumors By Releasing His Birth Certificate\\" , The Campaign Spot, National Review Online. Geraghty wrote that releasing his birth certificate could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet, namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; that his mother had originally named him \\"Barry\\" rather than \\"Barack\\"; and that Barack Obama Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen. In August 2008, Philip J. Berg, a former member of the Democratic State Committee of Pennsylvania, brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against Obama, which alleged \\"that Obama was born in Mombasa, Kenya.\\" In October 2008, an NPR article referred to \\"Kenyan-born Sen. Barack Obama.\\"Trial and Triumph: Stories Out Of Africa, NPR, October 9, 2008 Also that month, anonymous e-mails circulated claiming that the Associated Press (AP) had reported Obama was \\"Kenyan-Born\\". The claims were based on an AP story that had appeared five years earlier in a Kenyan publication, The Standard. The rumor-checking website Snopes.com found that the headline and lead-in sentence describing Obama as born in Kenya and misspelling his first name had been added by the Kenyan newspaper, and did not appear in the story issued by the AP or in any other contemporary newspaper that picked up the AP story. In 2012, the far-right website Breitbart published a copy of a promotional booklet that Obama's literary agency, Acton & Dystel, printed in 1991 (and later posted to their website, in a biography in place until April 2007) which misidentified Obama's birthplace and states that Obama was \\"born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.\\" When this was posted by Breitbart, the booklet's editor said that this incorrect information had been her mistake, not based on anything provided to her agency by Obama. Release of the birth certificates =Short form, 2008= Scanned image of Barack Obama's birth certificate released by his presidential campaign in June 2008. On June 12, 2008, Obama's campaign responded to the rumors by posting an image of Obama's birth certificate on the \\"Fight The Smears\\" website. The image is a scan of a laser-printed document obtained from and certified by the Hawaii Department of Health on June 6, 2007. It is a \\"Certification of Live Birth\\", sometimes referred to as a short form birth certificate, and contains less information than the longer \\"Certificate of Live Birth\\", which Hawaii no longer issues. Asked about this, Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo explained that Hawaii stopped issuing the longer \\"Certificate\\" in 2001 when their birth records were \\"put into electronic files for consistent reporting\\", and therefore Hawaii \\"does not have a short-form or long-form certificate\\". A \\"record of live birth\\", partially handwritten and partially typed, was created and submitted in 1961 when Obama was born, and is \\"located in a bound volume in a file cabinet on the first floor of the state Department of Health\\". The document was used to create the state's electronic records, and has been examined by state officials multiple times since the controversy began. In releasing the certificate, the Obama website declared that the rumors \\"aren't actually about that piece of paper ‚Äì they're about manipulating people into thinking Barack is not an American citizen\\". The campaign also provided the Daily Kos blog with a copy of the document. Referring to this release, National Review columnist Jim Geraghty, wrote on June 12, 2008: Frequent arguments of those questioning Obama's eligibility related to the fact that he did not originally release a copy of his \\"original\\" or \\"long form\\" birth certificate, but rather a \\"short form\\" version that did not include all of the information given on 1961 Hawaii-issued birth certificates. It was claimed that the use of the term \\"certification of live birth\\" on the first document means it is not equivalent to a \\"birth certificate\\". These arguments have been debunked numerous times by media investigations, every judicial forum that has addressed the matter, and Hawaiian government officials‚Äîamong whom a consensus has been reached that the document released by the Obama campaign is indeed his official birth certificate. The director of the state Department of Human Health confirmed that the state \\"has Sen. Obama's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures\\". The short form is \\"prima facie evidence of the fact of birth in any court proceeding\\". Rejection by conspiracy theorists The release of the certificate in 2008 resulted in a fresh round of questions. It was asserted that the certificate had been digitally forged with Adobe Photoshop and lacked a stamped seal of the state, which led them to demand that Obama release his \\"original\\" 1961 birth certificate. Jerome Corsi, author of the book The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, told Fox News that \\"the campaign has a false, fake birth certificate posted on their website... it's been shown to have watermarks from Photoshop. It's a fake document that's on the Web site right now, and the original birth certificate the campaign refuses to produce.\\" This view was rejected by FactCheck.org, which viewed the Obama campaign's hard copy of the Certification of Live Birth and reported that: Corsi continued to cast doubt on Obama's birth certificate as late as March 2019. In a CNN interview, he stated, \\"I want to see the original 1961 birth records from Kenya, that'll settle it...the State of Hawaii will not show those records to anyone.\\" Corsi's attorney, Larry Klayman, falsely asserted during the same interview, \\"the birth certificate uses the word ‚ÄòAfrican- American‚Äô in 1961.\\" Hawaii Department of Health response The director of Hawaii's Department of Health, Chiyome Fukino, issued a statement confirming that the state held Obama's \\"original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures\\". Noting \\"there have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama's official birth certificate\\", Fukino explained that the department was prohibited by state law from releasing it to \\"persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\\" She stated: \\"No state official, including Gov. Linda Lingle, has ever instructed that this vital record be handled in a manner different from any other vital record in the possession of the State of Hawaii.\\"Hawaii Revised Statutes ¬ß338-18 Disclosure of records , January 4, 2011 According to the website TVNewser, CNN's researchers stated in 2009 that the original birth certificate no longer existed, as Hawaii discarded all paper birth records in 2001, and the certification of live birth was the official copy. Contradicting this report, Janice Okubo, public information officer for the Hawaii DOH, said \\"We don't destroy vital records.\\" The Health Department's director emphasized the assertion: Joshua Wisch, a spokesman for the Hawaii Attorney General's office, stated in 2011 that the original \\"long form\\" birth certificate ‚Äî described by Hawaiian officials as a \\"record of live birth\\" kept in the archives of the Hawaii Department of Health is \\"... a Department of Health record and it can't be released to anybody\\", including President Obama. Wisch added that state law does not authorize photocopying such records. =Long form, 2011= On April 22, 2011, Obama asked Loretta Fuddy, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, for certified copies of his original Certificate of Live Birth (\\"long-form birth certificate\\"). Accompanying the letter was a written request from Judith Corley, Obama's personal counsel, requesting a waiver of the department's policy of issuing only computer-generated certificates. Corley stated that granting the waiver would relieve the department of the burden of repeated inquiries into the President's birth records. On April 25, 2011, Fuddy approved the request and witnessed the copying process as the health department's registrar issued the certified copies. The same day, Corley personally visited the department headquarters in Honolulu to pay the required fee on Obama's behalf, and received the two requested certified copies of the original birth certificate, an accompanying letter from Fuddy attesting to the authenticity of same, and a receipt for the processing fee. Fuddy said that she had granted the exception to its normal policy of issuing only computer-generated copies by virtue of Obama's status, in an effort to avoid ongoing requests for the birth certificate. On April 27, 2011, White House staffers gave reporters a copy of the certificate, and posted a PDF image of the certificate on the White House website. The certificate reconfirmed the information on the official short-form certificate released in 2008, and provided additional details such as the name of the hospital at which Obama was born. Rejection by conspiracy theorists A claim put forth by the Drudge Report that the newly released document was a forgery made with image editing software quickly spread on the Internet. Nathan Goulding, chief technology officer of the National Review magazine, dismissed the matter of \\"layered components\\" found in the White House PDF by suggesting \\"that whoever scanned the birth certificate in Hawaii forgot to turn off the OCR setting on the scanner.\\" Nathan added, \\"I've confirmed that scanning an image, converting it to a PDF, optimizing that PDF, and then opening it up in Illustrator, does in fact create layers similar to what is seen in the birth certificate PDF. You can try it yourself at home.\\" \\"Showing papers\\" Goldie Taylor, a commentator for the African American news site The Grio, characterized the demand that Obama provide his birth certificate as an equivalent of making him \\"show his papers\\", as blacks were once required to do under Jim Crow laws. Sociologist Matthew W. Hughey has cited many of the claims as evidence of racial \\"othering\\" of Obama against the conflation of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) subject as the ideal and authentic American citizen. False claims =Born in Kenya= Some opponents of Obama's presidential eligibility claim that he was born in Kenya and was therefore not born a United States citizen. Whether Obama having been born outside the U.S. would have invalidated his U.S. citizenship at birth is debated. Political commentator Andrew Malcolm, of the Los Angeles Times, wrote that Obama would still be eligible for the presidency, regardless of where he was born, because his mother was an American citizen, saying that Obama's mother \\"could have been on Mars when wee Barry emerged and he'd still be American.\\" A contrary view is promoted by UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh, who has said that in the hypothetical scenario that Obama was born outside the U.S., he would be a natural-born citizen, since the then-applicable law would have required Obama's mother to have been in the U.S. at least \\"five years after the age of 14\\", but Ann Dunham was three months shy of her 19th birthday when Obama was born.Volokh interpreted the law differently in , but later posted a correction at Obama's paternal step-grandmother's version of events An incorrect but popularly reported claim is that his father's stepmother, Sarah Obama, told Anabaptist Bishop Ron McRae in a recorded transatlantic telephone conversation that she was present when Obama was born in Kenya. The McClatchy newspapers gave an explanation of how the story about Obama's step-grandmother began. The tape is cut off in the middle of the conversation, before the passage in which she clarifies her meaning: \\"'Obama was not born in Mombasa. He was born in America,' the translator says after talking to the woman. ... Another response later says, 'Obama in Hawaii. Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii.'\\" Sarah Obama shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune. In the interview, Obama's paternal step-grandmother stated that six months after Barack Obama Sr. and Ann Dunham were married, she received a letter at her home in Kenya announcing the birth of Barack Obama II, who was born August 4, 1961. In a June 2012 interview at her Kenyan home, Sarah Obama was asked: \\"Some people want to believe that the president was born in Kenya. Have these people ever bothered you or asked for his birth certificate?\\" Her response was: \\"But Barack Obama wasn't born in Kenya.\\" Fake Kenyan birth certificate On August 2, 2009, Orly Taitz released and attached to court documents a purported Kenyan birth certificate which she said, if authenticated and shown to be genuine, would significantly narrow and shorten the discovery and pre- trial litigation period in the Keyes v. Bowen lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs asked for a judicial order that Obama provide documentation that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. Legal papers submitted describe the document as an \\"unauthenticated color photocopy of certified copy of registration of birth\\".\\"Kenya 'birth certificate' said to be fake\\" , United Press International. August 4, 2009. The document was almost immediately revealed to be a forgery. It purports to have been issued by the \\"Republic of Kenya\\", when in fact, such a state did not yet exist at the time of Obama's birth as indicated on the document (Kenya was a British Colony until 1963).Snopes.com: Kenyan Mistake. February 15, 2011. Subsequently, evidence was unearthed that the alleged Kenyan birth certificate was a modified version of a 1959 Australian birth certificate found on an online genealogy website.Rosendorff, Dina. \\"Adelaide man caught up in bid to oust Obama\\" , PM, Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Transcript of program aired August 4, 2009.Koppelman, Alex (August 4, 2009).\\"Source for forged Kenyan birth certificate found?\\" , Salon. The Washington Independent website cited an anonymous bloggerSee anonymous blogger . as having taken responsibility for the forgery and posting four photos substantiating his claim. =Not born in Hawaii= Despite the existence of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, Terry Lakin's attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that he was born in Hawaii. However, the suggestion that this could have applied to Obama was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: \\"If you were born in Bali, for example, you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali. You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu. The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate\\". Another fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after Obama was born, while Obama's published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu. Additionally, some people claim that the information in the birth certificate only has to be based on the testimony of one parent. On July 27, 2009, Fukino issued a statement explicitly stating she has \\"seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen.\\" Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo elaborated on state policy for the release of vital records: \\"If someone from Obama's campaign gave us permission in person and presented some kind of verification that he or she was Obama's designee, we could release the vital record.\\" Martin was seeking \\"a copy of Obama's birth certificate, and related files and records.\\" A hospital spokesperson at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children has said that their standard procedure is to neither confirm nor deny Obama was born there, \\"even though all the information out there says he was born at Kapiolani Hospital\\", citing federal privacy laws. Obama's birth announcement, published in The Honolulu Advertiser on August 13, 1961 In 1961, birth notices for Barack Obama were published in both the Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on August 13 and 14, 1961, respectively, listing the home address of Obama's parents as 6085 Kalanianaole Highway in Honolulu. On November 9, 2008, in response to the persistent rumors, the Advertiser posted on its web site a screenshot of the announcement taken from its microfilmed archives. Such notices were sent to newspapers routinely by the Hawaii Department of Health. In an editorial published on July 29, 2009, the Star-Bulletin pointed out that both newspapers' vital-statistics columns are available on microfilm in the main state library. \\"Were the state Department of Health and Obama's parents really in cahoots to give false information to the newspapers [...]?\\" the newspaper asked. =Lost U.S. citizenship= It has been suggested that Obama obtained Indonesian citizenship (and thus may have lost U.S. citizenship) when he lived there as a child. As an attempt to prove that Obama was no longer a U.S. citizen (or held dual citizenship), some claim his 1981 trip to Pakistan took place at a time when there was supposedly a ban on United States passport holders entering that country, which would in turn have required him to use a non-U.S. passport. There was in fact no such ban. A The New York Times article and U.S. State Department travel advisories from 1981 make it clear that travel to Pakistan by U.S. passport holders was legal at that time. An April Fools' Day hoax email circulated on the Internet starting in 2009. It falsely claimed that Obama applied to Occidental College under the name \\"Barry Soetoro\\" claiming to be \\"a foreign student from Indonesia\\" in order to obtain a Fulbright scholarship (which does not exist for undergraduate students from Indonesia). Disputes over \\"natural-born citizen\\" requirements Another theory of Obama's ineligibility is that, regardless of his place of birth, he does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states: \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States....\\" According to law professor Gabriel J. Chin, \\"there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment.\\" Despite this agreement, two similar but distinct theories nonetheless contend Obama, although born in Hawaii, does not qualify as a \\"natural-born citizen\\". =Parental citizenship= Some campaigners, such as the Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, contend that in order for a person to be a natural- born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is necessary that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, Obama could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to be President of the United States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited a passage in the decision on an 1875 voting rights case which came before the U.S. Supreme Court‚ÄîMinor v. Happersett‚Äîin which the court stated there was no doubt that \\"all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens\\" were natural-born citizens.Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, pp. 3, 5. This legal theory on Obama's eligibility was unsuccessfully litigated several times, most notably in Ankeny v. Governor of the State of Indiana (2008). =Dual citizenship= Others, including New Jersey attorney Leo Donofrio, have falsely claimed that a person cannot be a natural-born citizen if he is a dual citizen at birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that because Obama's father was a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies at the time Obama was born, Obama was born a dual citizen and therefore was not a natural-born citizen. In August 2008, the Rocky Mountain News ran an online article asserting that Obama is both a U.S. and a Kenyan citizen. This turned out to be incorrect according to FactCheck.org, which noted that Obama was indeed born a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) under British law, by virtue of his descent from a Kenyan father at a time when Kenya was a British colony, but lost CUKC citizenship and became a Kenyan citizen when that country gained independence in 1963. However, Kenya's 1963 constitution prohibited dual citizenship in adulthood. Obama therefore automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship on his 23rd birthday in 1984, by failing to formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Although the paper apologized for the error and published a correction, the article continued to provide fuel for online rumors about Obama's eligibility for the presidency. The current Kenyan constitution effective since 2010 permits dual citizenship, but requires those who lost Kenyan citizenship prior to 2010 to complete a registration process in order to regain citizenship. Campaigners and proponents A protester questioning the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate Notable advocates of the view that Obama may not be eligible for the Presidency include Philip J. Berg, a Pennsylvania attorney and 9/11 conspiracy theorist. Berg describes himself as a \\"moderate to liberal\\" Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton for president.Rizo, Chris (December 8, 2008). \\"Supreme Court declines to hear Obama citizenship challenge\\" , LegalNewsline.com. Another notable advocate is Alan Keyes, who was defeated by Obama in the 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate election, served as a diplomat in the Reagan administration, and is currently a media personality and self-described \\"conservative political activist\\". Orly Taitz, a California dentist and attorney who emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel, then to the United States, and holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, has been called the \\"queen bee of the birthers\\", because she is often seen as the face of the movement. Other notable advocates include Andy Martin, a perennial candidate who was \\"widely credited with starting the cyberwhisper campaign\\" that Obama is a secret Muslim, and Robert L. Schulz, a tax protester and activist who placed full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune in December 2008 arguing that Obama had been born in Kenya or had subsequently renounced U.S. citizenship. Larry Klayman, founder of both Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, expressed doubts about Obama's natural-born citizenship. The Constitution Party, a paleoconservative third party, also campaigned for release of Obama's original long-form certificate.Weigel, Dave (December 12, 2008). \\"Stay Classy, Constitution Party\\" , Reason. Also see \\"Got Birth Certificate? Constitution Party Calls For Barack Obama To Prove Eligibility For Office\\", Constitution Party Website (December 9, 2008) (archived from the original on July 25, 2011). In December 2008, Alex Koppelman, a senior writer for Salon, characterized nearly all of the prominent people promoting the story Obama was not eligible to be president‚Äîincluding Jerome Corsi, Philip Berg, Andy Martin, and Robert Schultz‚Äîas having a \\"history of conspiracist thought\\". The website AmericaMustKnow.com encouraged visitors to lobby members of the Electoral College to vote against Obama's confirmation as President and become faithless electors. Electors around the country received numerous letters and e-mails contending that Obama's birth certificate is a forgery and that he was born in Kenya, and requesting that Obama be denied the presidency. Some of the online campaigners coordinated their efforts with weekly conference calls, in which they discussed the latest news and how to advance the story. The campaign was supported by the conservative WorldNetDaily (WND) website, which sponsored a letter-writing campaign to the Supreme Court. WNDs publisher Joseph Farah has written a number of editorials arguing that Obama's eligibility needs to be confirmed. WND has mounted an advertising campaign, using electronic billboards to ask \\"Where's The Birth Certificate?\\" The talk radio hosts Michael Savage, G. Gordon Liddy, Brian Sussman, Lars Larson, Bob Grant, Jim Quinn, Rose Tennent, Barbara Simpson, Mark Davis, and Fred Grandy have all promoted the ineligibility claims on their radio shows. Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs have also broached the issue several times on their shows. Savage, during an episode of his nationally syndicated radio show The Savage Nation, said that \\"We're getting ready for the Communist takeover of America with a noncitizen at the helm.\\" Some celebrities have promoted or touched upon the ineligibility claims, as well. In August 2009, actor Chuck Norris, while not embracing the eligibility claims, wrote an open letter to Obama urging that he officially release his \\"original birth certificate\\", saying, \\"Refusing to post your original birth certificate is an unwise political and leadership decision that is enabling the 'birther' controversy.\\"\\"What Obama and My Wife Have in Common\\" , Chuck Norris, August 9, 2009 In December 2010, Baltimore Orioles baseball player Luke Scott asserted in a Yahoo! interview that Obama \\"was not born here\\" and that his birth certificate was never released.Meet Luke Scott: He‚Äôs a Baseball Birther , HyperVocal.com, December 9, 2010 The Huffington Post reported that, in April 2011 during his stage show, Charlie Sheen said, \\"For starters, I was fucking born here, how about that? And I got proof! Nothing photoshopped about my birth certificate.\\" According to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, \\"the birther movement has gained a large following on the radical right ... it has been adopted by the most noxious elements out there\\". Some of those \\"noxious elements\\" include a number of avowed white-supremacist and neo- Nazi groups. James Wenneker von Brunn, an avowed white supremacist charged as the gunman in the June 10, 2009, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting, had previously posted messages to the Internet accusing Obama and the media of hiding documents about his life. In March 2017, after Obama was no longer the president, Malik Obama, his paternal half brother, posted on Twitter an image of a fake Kenyan birth certificate, which had been \\"debunked\\" in 2009 when it was first presented as part of one of the failed lawsuits that challenged Obama's ineligibility. =Donald Trump= Trump was the most prominent promoter of birther conspiracy theories. This elevated Trump's political profile in the years leading up to his successful 2016 presidential campaign. According to political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, Trump \\"became a virtual spokesperson for the 'birther' movement. The strategy worked: when Trump flirted with running for president in 2011, his popularity was concentrated among the sizable share of Republicans who thought that President Obama was foreign born or a Muslim or both.\\" In 2010, at the urging of Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, the National Enquirer began promoting a potential Trump presidential campaign, and with Cohen's involvement, the tabloid began questioning Obama's birthplace and citizenship. In March 2011, during an interview on Good Morning America, Donald Trump said he was seriously considering running for president, that he was a \\"little\\" skeptical of Obama's citizenship, and that someone who shares this view should not be so quickly dismissed as an \\"idiot\\" (as Trump considers the term \\"birther\\" to be \\"derogatory\\"). Trump added, \\"Growing up no one knew him\\", a claim ranked Pants-on-Fire by Politifact. Later, Trump appeared on The View repeating several times that \\"I want him [Obama] to show his birth certificate.\\" He speculated that \\"there [was] something on that birth certificate that [Obama] doesn't like\\", a comment which host Whoopi Goldberg described as \\"the biggest pile of dog mess I've heard in ages.\\" On the March 30, 2011, edition of CNN Newsroom, anchor Suzanne Malveaux commented on Trump's statements, pointing out that she had made a documentary for which she had gone to Hawaii and spoken with people who knew Obama as a child. In an NBC TV interview broadcast on April 7, 2011, Trump said he would not let go of the issue, because he was not satisfied that Obama had proved his citizenship. After Trump began making his views public, he was contacted by Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily, who was reportedly on the phone with Trump every day for a week, providing Trump with a \\"birther primer\\", answers to questions, and advice. After Obama released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011, Trump said \\"I am really honored and I am really proud, that I was able to do something that nobody else could do.\\" On October 24, 2012, Trump offered to donate five million dollars to the charity of Obama's choice in return for the publication of his college and passport applications before October 31, 2012. On September 16, 2016, as the Republican Party presidential nominee, Trump conceded that \\"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.\\" Trump gave himself credit for putting the controversy to rest and also repeated a false claim that Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and one of Obama's opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, had started the controversy concerning Obama's place of birth. While those who did so were Clinton supporters, there is no evidence of Clinton or her campaign questioning Obama's birthplace. =Joe Arpaio= Volunteer investigators working under the direction of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio have asserted that Obama's birth certificate is a computer-generated forgery. Rejecting this claim, an assistant to Hawaii's attorney general stated in July 2012 that \\"President Obama was born in Honolulu, and his birth certificate is valid.... Regarding the latest allegations from a sheriff in Arizona, they are untrue, misinformed and misconstrue Hawaii law.\\" Arizona state officials, including Governor Jan Brewer and Secretary of State Ken Bennett, have also dismissed Arpaio's objections and accepted the validity of Obama's birth certificate. Alex Pareene, a staff writer for Salon, wrote regarding a May 2012 trip to Hawaii by Arpaio's people that \\"I think we have long since passed the point at which I'd find this story believable in a fictional setting\\". In December 2016, Arpaio presented \\"9 points of forgery\\" that he said proved that the digital image of Obama's long form birth certificate was not authentic. He said he would submit his evidence to federal authorities. =Matthew Hill= TNGA Rep. Matthew Hill speaking during 2008 Republican primary debate, Jonesborough, Tennessee Rep. Matthew Hill, one of a handful of Tennessee General Assembly members widely reported at the time to be birthers, demanded in 2009 that newly-elected president Obama should be compelled to present Hill and other Tennessee state legislators with a certified copy of his Hawaiian birth certificate. Hill interviewed birther conspiracy advocate Orly Taitz at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Nashville for a February 10, 2009, segment podcasted online by the IRN/USA Radio Network. During The Matthew Hill Show he stated: > We've said on this program many times ... we've had people call in and say > why are you picking on him? And I've said, \\"Look it's really simple. If he > is a U.S. citizen you produce the papers. If he's not a U.S. citizen, what > does he do? He hides them. He's hiding them. We need the truth. We need the > documents unsealed.

Retrieved from the Internet Archive, > September 19, 2016. =Roy Moore= U.S. Senate candidate and former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court Roy Moore first questioned Obama's citizenship in 2008, and said in 2016 that he didn't believe Obama had natural-born citizenship. =Richard Shelby= In February 2009, the Cullman Times, an Alabama newspaper, reported that at a town hall meeting there, U.S. Senator from Alabama Richard Shelby was asked if there was any truth to the rumors that Obama was not a natural- born citizen. According to the Times report, Shelby said, \\"Well his father was Kenyan and they said he was born in Hawaii, but I haven't seen any birth certificate. You have to be born in America to be president.\\" A Shelby spokesperson denied the story, but the newspaper stood by it. =Roy Blunt= On July 28, 2009, Mike Stark approached Missouri Congressman Roy Blunt asking him about the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen. Blunt responded: \\"What I don't know is why the President can't produce a birth certificate. I don't know anybody else that can't produce one. And I think that's a legitimate question. No health records, no birth certificate.\\" Blunt's spokesperson later claimed that the quote was taken out of context. =Jean Schmidt= After giving a speech at the Voice of America Freedom Rally in West Chester, Ohio on September 5, 2009, Republican congresswoman Jean Schmidt replied to a woman who commented that Obama was ineligible for the Presidency, \\"I agree with you. But the courts don't.\\" Schmidt's office subsequently responded that a video clip of this comment was \\"taken out of context\\", and reiterated that her stated position is that Obama is a citizen. She had earlier voted to certify the Electoral College vote affirming his presidency, and had said she believes Obama is a U.S. citizen. =Nathan Deal= In November 2009, then-Representative Nathan Deal replied to a question about whether he believed that Obama \\"is a native-born American citizen who is eligible to serve as president\\" with a statement that \\"I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the President asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can have an answer to this question.\\" Contrasting the differing fates of Deal, who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in Georgia, and former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, David Weigel of Slate noted: \\"Dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp didn't stop Deal from winning a statewide primary.\\" =Sarah Palin= During a December 3, 2009 interview on Rusty Humphries' radio talk show, Humphries asked Sarah Palin if she would make Barack Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run. Palin responded, \\"I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers.\\" Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, \\"I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records ‚Äì all of that is fair game. The McCain‚ÄìPalin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area.\\" After news organizations and blogs picked up the quotation, Palin issued a statement on her Facebook page in which she clarified that she meant to say that voters have the right to ask questions, and she herself has never asked Obama to produce a birth certificate. She then went on to compare questioning of Obama's birth certificate to questions that were raised during the 2008 presidential elections about her maternity to her son, Trig. This analogy was criticized by Mark Milian of the Los Angeles Times, who commented that \\"It's not like Barack Obama hosted a radio show and called her a baby faker.\\" In addition, Andrew Sullivan, an established skeptic of Palin's relationship with Trig, wrote in response to her comments: \\"Palin has never produced Trig's birth certificate or a single piece of objective medical evidence that proves he is indeed her biological son.\\" =Tracey Mann= Tracey Mann, a candidate running for Congress from Kansas in 2010, stated at a candidate forum that Obama \\"should show his birth certificate to really resolve this thing one way or another\\". In a radio interview, he answered a question as \\"I think the president of the United States needs to come forth with his papers and show everyone that he's an American citizen and put this issue to bed once and for all.\\" In response, on July 21, 2010, The Hutchinson News, a local paper in Hutchinson, Kansas, withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann \\"questions the citizenship of President Barack Obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people ‚Äì including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers\\". Mann responded that he was \\"disappointed and mystified by the Hutchinson News decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of [his] position\\", as he is not \\"interested in pursuing this issue in Congress\\", and he has \\"never had any interest in spending any time on the matter\\". Mann was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by state senator Tim Huelskamp.Clarkin, Mary (August 27, 2010), \\"Republican from Fowler takes 1st Congressional District primary\\" , The Hutchinson News =David Vitter= At a townhall meeting in Metairie, Louisiana on July 11, 2010, Senator David Vitter responded to a question about Barack Obama's birth certificate saying \\"I personally don't have standing to bring litigation in court, but I support conservative legal organizations and others who would bring that to court. I think that is the valid and most possibly effective grounds to do it.\\" His campaign did not provide any additional comments on the matter. =Newt Gingrich= On September 11, 2010, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated that Obama could only be understood by people who \\"understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior\\". While Gingrich did not define what constitutes \\"Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior\\", White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs accused Gingrich of \\"trying to appeal to the fringe of people who don't believe the president was born in this country\\". Gibbs went on to say, \\"You would normally expect better of somebody who held the position of Speaker of the House, but look, it is political season, and most people will say anything, and Newt Gingrich does that on a, genuinely, on a regular basis.\\" =Andy Martin= In December 2010, Andy Martin (plaintiff in Martin v. Lingle and self-described \\"King of the Birthers\\") announced his candidacy to seek the 2012 Republican nomination for the President of the United States. In February 2011, Martin's planned appearance at a Republican meeting in Deering, New Hampshire, was cancelled after his anti-Semitic past was discovered. =Mike Huckabee= On February 28, 2011, on Steve Malzberg's radio program Mike Huckabee, a 2008 candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, falsely claimed that Obama had been raised in Kenya and that \\"[Obama] probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.\\" Huckabee, speaking on The O'Reilly Factor, said that he misspoke and intended to say Indonesia, characterizing his own comment as a \\"verbal gaffe\\". =Michele Bachmann= In March 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann told conservative radio host Jeff Katz on his program, \\"I'll tell you one thing, if I was ever to run for president of the United States, I think the first thing I would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate, so we can get that off the table.\\" Previously on Good Morning America, when asked about President Obama's origins, she replied, \\"Well, that isn't for me to state. That's for the president to state.\\" =Mike Coffman= On May 12, 2012, Mike Coffman, a congressman running for re-election in the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado, addressed a Republican fund-raising event in Elbert County. Coffman stated that he did not know where President Barack Obama was born. Coffman went on to say of Obama that \\"in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American.\\" Coffman issued an apology on May 16, saying that he had misspoken and that he had confidence in President Obama's citizenship and legitimacy as president. In a May 23 Denver Post op-ed piece, Coffman described his comment as \\"inappropriate and boneheaded.\\" =Arizona electors= In December 2012, three out of the eleven electors from Arizona who cast their votes for Mitt Romney, raised doubts about Barack Obama's birthplace. One of those electors was the chair of the Republican Party of Arizona, Tom Morrissey. Morrissey later insisted that he is not a birther, but stated that \\"In [his] opinion, what [he has] seen from the president, produced as a birth certificate, does not convince [him] that it is a real document.\\" Political impact A birth certificate-related bumper sticker, below two other stickers Although claims about Obama's citizenship were evaluated in 2008 by the McCain campaign and ultimately rejected, they became a significant issue among sections of the political right. Activists unsuccessfully lobbied Republican members of Congress to reject the 2008 Electoral College vote and block Obama's election when it came before Congress for certification on January 8, 2008. By mid-2009, the natural born citizen issue was one of the hottest and most lucrative sources of fundraising for organizations on the right that raise funds through direct mail and telemarketing. Online petition sites such as that of Alan Keyes, who has been collecting signatures on the birth certificate issue, are a major source for generating mailing lists of movement conservatives. The web site WorldNetDaily published more than 200 articles on the subject by July 2009 and has sold billboards, bumper stickers and postcards asking \\"Where's the birth certificate?\\" and similar slogans in an effort which has \\"already raised tens of thousands of dollars.\\" Moderate conservatives soon found themselves \\"bombarded with birther stuff\\". Protesters at the Tea Party protests in 2009 carried signs about the birth certificate issue, some of which were recommended by protest organizers. In an incident that attracted widespread media coverage, moderate Republican Representative Michael Castle was booed and heckled during a July 2009 town hall meeting in Georgetown, Delaware, when he told a woman protesting about Obama's birth certificate: \\"if you're referring to the president there, he is a citizen of the United States.\\" NBC Nightly News reported that other members of Congress often hear the issue too; an anonymous congressman told the program that he was reluctant to advertise his own town hall meetings for fear of this issue drowning out everything else.\\"Obama's Birthplace Still blog fodder\\" , NBC Nightly News. July 22, 2009. A number of Republican legislators have proposed legislation and constitutional amendments at the state and federal levels to address issues raised by the birth certificate campaigners. Some Republicans are said to \\"want the issue to go away\\", seeing it as a distraction. Democratic commentators have criticized the reluctance of some Republicans to distance themselves from the proponents of the conspiracy theories, suggesting that \\"Republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base\\". NBC News' \\"First Read\\" team commented: \\"the real story in all of this is that Republican Party has a HUGE problem with its base right now.\\" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele released a statement through his spokesperson saying, \\"Chairman Steele believes that this is an unnecessary distraction and believes that the president is a U.S. citizen\\".Sargent, Greg (July 29, 2009). \\"Michael Steele Blasts Birtherism As 'Unnecessary Distraction,' Says Obama Is 'U.S. Citizen'\\" , The Plum Line (blog). Conservative Joel Pollak, writing for The American Thinker, has stated that the reason the \\"Birther theory\\" has caught on particularly among conservatives, is the weakness of the Republican opposition, stating: Political analyst Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic and CBS News suggests this phenomenon goes to the heart of the dilemma now facing the Republican Party, positing that Political analyst Andrew Sullivan, writing in The Sunday Times, stated On July 27, 2009, the House of Representatives passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood. The resolution, containing language recognizing Hawaii as President Obama's birth state, passed by a vote of 378‚Äì0. =Opinion surveys= In October 2008, the Orange County Register's OC Political Pulse poll found that a third of responding Republicans believed that Obama had been born outside the United States. As a result of the widespread publicity given to the citizenship controversy, 60% of respondents in an Ohio State University survey carried out in November 2008 had heard of the issue. However, only 10% believed the claims that Obama was not a citizen. An opinion poll carried out for Daily Kos by Research 2000 in July 2009 found that 77% of Americans believed that Obama was born in the U.S., while 11% didn't, and 12% were unsure. However, Republicans and Southerners were far more likely than other political or demographic groups to doubt that Obama was born in the United States. 58% of Republicans either believed that Obama was not born in the U.S. (28%) or were not sure (30%), with 42% believing that he was. An overwhelming majority of Democrats (93%) and independents (83%) believed that he was born in the U.S. Support for the belief that Obama was born outside the U.S. was strongest in the South, where only 47% of those polled believed he was born in the U.S., compared with an average of 90% of residents of the Northeast, Midwest and West. A marked racial disparity in the South was also apparent. Politico's congressional reporter, Glenn Thrush, commented that the Research 2000 poll \\"explains why Republicans, including Roy Blunt, are playing footsie with the Birther fringe.\\" Writing on National Journal's Pollster.com blog, Brendan Nyhan observed that the poll \\"suggests that the encouragement of the birth certificate myth by conservative pundits and Republican politicians has begun to activate the GOP base on this issue.\\" A Public Policy Polling survey carried out in August 2009 found that 32% of Republicans in Virginia thought that Obama was born in the U.S., 41% thought he was foreign-born and the remaining 27% were unsure. In Utah, an August 2009 poll carried out for the Deseret News and KSL-TV found that 67% of Utahns accepted the evidence that Obama was born in the U.S. The poll found that those who do not believe that Obama was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle- aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education. A Pew Research Center poll found that 80% of Americans had heard about the Obama citizenship claims by August 2009. The poll found a significant partisan divide in views of the news coverage, with 58% of Democrats saying that the allegations had received too much attention from the media. Republicans were more inclined to say that the allegations had received too little attention, with 39% expressing this view against only 26% saying that the controversy had received too much attention. In a Harris Poll online survey of 2,320 adults conducted in March 2010, 25% of the respondents said they believed that Obama was \\"not born in the United States and so is not eligible to be president.\\"Wingnuts' and President Obama\\" , Harris Polls, March 24, 2010. Retrieved July 18, 2010 In a July 2010 CNN poll of adult Americans, 16% said they had doubts that Obama was born in the United States, and a further 11% were certain that he was not. The percentage of doubters plummeted after President Obama released the long form certificate in April 2011. A Gallup telephone poll of 1018 adults conducted in May 2011 found that 5% of respondents believed that Obama was \\"definitely born in another country\\" and 8% believed he was \\"probably born in another country\\", versus 47% believing he was \\"definitely\\" and 18% \\"probably\\" born in the US. Broken down by political affiliation, the same poll found that 23% of self-identified Republicans, 14% of independents, and 5% of Democrats thought Obama was definitely or probably born in another country. In July 2016, four months before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency, 41 percent of Republicans disagreed that Obama was born in the United States and 31 percent neither agreed nor disagreed, per an NBC poll. A 2015 study found that among individuals who held birther views, they were predominantly conservative/Republican and held anti-Black attitudes. A 2019 study found that \\"among white Americans, birther beliefs are uniquely associated with racial animus.\\" =Dilemma for Republicans= Because a portion of Republican voters and their Tea Party supporters believed Obama was not eligible to hold public office (see Opinion surveys section), Republicans sometimes found themselves caught in a dilemma between losing support or damaging their credibility. They had \\"to walk the fine line of humoring conspiracy-minded supporters without explicitly questioning Obama's legitimacy...\\" Other Republicans, including former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, however, have plainly rejected these claims. An example of these situations was Michael Castle, then Representative for Delaware, who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. At a town hall meeting, Castle was confronted by constituents who jeered him for insisting that Obama is a citizen of the United States. Castle, one of the leading Republican moderates in the House, was later defeated by Tea Party-backed Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary, who herself later lost the general election to Democratic nominee Chris Coons. Commentary and criticism A man carrying a sign at a Tea Party protest in Austin, Texas, on July 4, 2009McGrue, Bonzo (July 4, 2009), Austin Tea Party Protest , Flickr. Retrieved July 2, 2010. Proponents of claims doubting Obama's eligibility have been dubbed \\"birthers\\" by their critics, who have drawn a parallel with 9/11 conspiracy theorists or \\"truthers\\". Leslie Savan of The Nation has compared the so-called \\"birthers\\" to other groups as well, including those who deny the moon landing, the Holocaust or global warming; \\"Teabaggers who refuse to believe they must pay taxes\\" and creationists who believe the earth is 6,000 years old. MSNBC political commentator Rachel Maddow has defined a \\"birther\\" as: A number of conservative commentators have criticized its proponents and their effect on the wider conservative movement. Talk show host Michael Medved has also been critical, calling them \\"the worst enemy of the conservative movement\\" for making other conservatives \\"look sick, troubled and not suitable for civilized company.\\" Conservative columnist Ann Coulter has referred to them as \\"just a few cranks.\\" During the 2008 presidential campaign, conservative pundit Steve Sailer similarly dismissed birthers' claims, considering the theory that Obama was born in Kenya to be especially implausible: An editorial in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin dismissed the claims about Obama's eligibility as proposing \\"a vast conspiracy involving Obama's parents, state officials, the news media, the Secret Service, think-tanks and a host of yet-to-be-uncovered others who have connived since Obama's birth to build a false record so that he could eventually seek the presidency 47 years later.\\" The St. Petersburg Times' fact-checking website, PolitiFact.com, concluded its series of articles on the birth certificate issue by saying: In November 2008, commentator and social critic Camille Paglia criticized the \\"blathering, fanatical overkill\\" of the topic, but also questioned Obama's response: \\"Obama could have ended the entire matter months ago by publicly requesting Hawaii to issue a fresh, long- form, stamped certificate and inviting a few high-profile reporters in to examine the document and photograph it\\", she said.Paglia, Camille (November 12, 2008). \\"Obama surfs through,\\" Salon. A parenthetical in the same article noted that \\"(The campaign did make the \\"short-form\\" certificate available to Factcheck.org)\\". Factcheck.org noted, \\"The Hawaii Department of Health's birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long-form birth certificate, but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the State Department.\\"\\"Hawaii birth record request form\\" . Writing in December 2008, Alex Koppelman discussed the validity of the common argument ‚Äì that Obama should release a copy of his full, original certificate and the rumors and doubts would disappear. Conspiracy theory experts told Koppelman that when committed conspiracists are presented with more data debunking their theory, they refuse to accept the new evidence. \\"Whatever can't be ignored can be twisted to fit into the narrative; every new disclosure of something that should, by rights, end the controversy only opens up new questions, identifies new plotters\\", he wrote. Because Obama's release of the short-form had only \\"stoked the fever of conspiracy mongers\\", Koppelman predicted that releasing the long-form certificate \\"would almost certainly\\" continue the rumor cycle. In response to the notion that Obama's grandparents might have planted a birth announcement in newspapers just so their grandson could some day be president, FactCheck suggested that \\"those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high-quality tinfoil hat.\\" Brooks Jackson, the director of FactCheck, comments that \\"it all reflects a surge of paranoid distress among people who don't like Barack Obama\\" and who want the election results to go away. Chip Berlet, a journalist who has studied the spread of conspiracy theories, notes: > For some people, when their side loses an election, the only explanation > that makes sense to them ‚Äì that they can cope with ‚Äì is that sinister, bad, > evil people arranged some kind of fraud. American political writer Dana Milbank, writing for The Washington Post, described the Obama citizenship theories of Bob Schulz (chairman of the We the People Foundation, which in 2008 publicly challenged Obama's citizenship) as \\"tales from the tinfoil-hat brigade\\". Colorado presidential elector Camilla Auger, responding to lobbying of members of the Electoral College, commented: \\"I was concerned that there are that many nutty people in the country making depressing, absurd allegations.\\" Some commentators have asserted that racism is a factor motivating the promotion of Obama citizenship conspiracy theories.Ron Reagan, on his July 23, 2009, radio talk show. J. Richard Cohen, the President of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors hate groups and extremism, wrote an e-mail to supporters in July 2009 declaring: \\"This conspiracy theory was concocted by an anti-Semite and circulated by racist extremists who cannot accept the fact that a black man has been elected president.\\" An academic psychologist commented that a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology supported a conclusion that racism has played a role. Donald Trump's questioning how Obama gained admission to two Ivy-League institutions, as well as his comment, \\"I have a great relationship with the blacks,\\" led David Remnick, David Letterman and Bill Maher, among others, to accuse Trump of racism, and an increased attention on race with respect to Obama. In April 2011, Marilyn Davenport, a Tea Party activist and member of the executive committee of the Republican Party's local Orange County, California, organization, created a nationwide controversy when she circulated a photograph by email, widely seen as racist, that had been edited to depict Barack Obama as the child of two chimpanzees, and to which she had added the caption, \\"Now you know why no birth certificate\\". Following the release of Obama's long-form certificate later that month, The New York Times remarked in an editorial that, \\"It is inconceivable that this campaign to portray Mr. Obama as the insidious 'other' would have been conducted against a white president.\\" Legislation and litigation The controversy over Obama's citizenship and eligibility for the presidency prompted a number of Republican state and federal legislators to propose legislation aimed at requiring future presidential candidates to release copies of their birth certificates. Some legislators also lent their support to birth certificate-related litigation against Obama, joining as co- plaintiffs. Although Obama was confirmed as president-elect by Congress on January 8, 2009, and sworn in as President on January 20, litigation continued into his presidency. Numerous individuals and groups filed state or federal lawsuits seeking to have Obama disqualified from standing or being confirmed for the Presidency, or to compel him to release additional documentation relating to his citizenship. By mid-December 2008, at least 17 lawsuits had been filed challenging Obama's eligibility in states including North Carolina,Gonzales, Veronica (November 14, 2008). \\"Hampstead man's suit contests President-elect Obama's citizenship\\" , Wilmington Star-News (North Carolina). Ohio,McLaughlin, Sheila (November 1, 2008). \\"Lawsuit tossed on Obama's birth site\\", Cincinnati Enquirer. Pennsylvania,\\"Judge tosses suit over Obama's birth\\" , The Washington Times.

Associated Press. October 31, 2008 No such suit resulted in the grant of any relief to the plaintiffs by any court; all of the cases were rejected in lower courts. Three post-election suits were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In April 2011, the Arizona legislature became the first to pass a bill \\"requiring President Obama and other presidential candidates to prove their U.S. citizenship before their names can appear on the state's ballot\\". The bill, HB 2177, was vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer on April 18. Obama is not the first President to be the subject of controversy surrounding the location of his birth. Andrew Jackson was the subject of similar claims, although it is not certain that they were raised during his presidency. Some said that Chester A. Arthur was born outside the United States, with his birth records later allegedly falsified to show he was born in Vermont. Impact on the 2012 presidential election and beyond In May 2012, the Arizona Secretary of State, Ken Bennett, asked Hawaii to verify Obama's Hawaiian birth to ensure his eligibility to appear on the November ballot. After Bennett proved that he needed the information as part of the regular course of official business, Hawaii officially confirmed that the information in the copy of the Certificate of Live Birth for the President matches the original record in their files. Later the same month, the Mississippi state Democratic Party requested Hawaii to verify that the long-form image on the White House website matched the copy on file and they were provided with a certified verification, bearing the state seal and signed by state registrar Alvin T. Onaka, who had certified both released birth certificates. In September 2012, the State Objections Board of Kansas, composed of \\"three of the state's top elected Republicans\\", delayed acting on a petition to remove Barack Obama's name from the ballot, requesting information from Hawaii regarding his birth certificate; but later voted unanimously to accept Obama's citizenship and retain him on the state's ballot, despite objections from the floor by Orly Taitz. White House responses A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his \\"long form\\" birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate. Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue. =Press secretary's response= At the end of the May 27, 2009, press briefing, WorldNetDaily reporter Lester Kinsolving asked about Obama's birth certificate. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied, \\"It's on the Internet\\", to which Kinsolving responded \\"No, no, no ‚Äì the long form listing his hospital and physician.\\" Gibbs responded as follows: At a July 27, 2009, press briefing, radio talk show host Bill Press asked Gibbs if there was anything he could say to make the issue go away. Gibbs answered, \\"No. I mean, the God's honest truth is no,\\" because \\"nothing will assuage\\" those who continue to pursue what he called \\"made-up, fictional nonsense\\" despite the evidence that Obama had already provided.Press briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , White House (July 27, 2009). Retrieved July 28, 2009. On August 6, 2009, Gibbs commented, \\"You couldn't sell this script in Hollywood,\\" and summarized the contentions that he considered \\"totally crazy\\": =Barack Obama's response= At the February 2010 National Prayer Breakfast, Obama commented, \\"Surely you can question my policies without questioning my faith. Or for that matter my citizenship.\\" He directly addressed the issue in August 2010, in an interview with Brian Williams. Williams asked Obama about the fact that a fifth of the American people do not believe that he is either American born or a Christian. Obama responded that \\"there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly\\". He then added, \\"I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead.\\" On a few occasions, Obama has joked about the conspiracy theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 White House Correspondents' Dinner, Obama said there are few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, \\"Well, love and a birth certificate.\\" At the 2011 Gridiron Dinner, Obama referred to Bruce Springsteen's song, \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", and commented, \\"Some things just bear repeating.\\" On March 17, 2011 (Saint Patrick's Day), Obama said, \\"Now, speaking of ancestry, there has been some controversy about my own background. Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest.

In an April 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, \\"I think that over the last two and a half years there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ...

(DESERTEC) A super grid or supergrid is a wide-area transmission network, generally trans-continental or multinational, that is intended to make possible the trade of high volumes of electricity across great distances. It is sometimes also referred to as a \\"mega grid\\". Super grids typically are proposed to use high-voltage direct current (HVDC) to transmit electricity long distances. The latest generation of HVDC power lines can transmit energy with losses of only 1.6% per 1,000 km. Super grids could support a global energy transition by smoothing local fluctuations of wind energy and solar energy. In this context they are considered as a key technology to mitigate global warming. History The idea of creating long- distance transmission lines in order to take advantage of renewable sources distantly located is not new. In the US in the 1950s, a proposal was made to ship hydroelectric power from dams being constructed in the Pacific Northwest to consumers in Southern California, but it was opposed and scrapped. In 1961, U.S. president John F. Kennedy authorized a large public works project using new high-voltage, direct current technology from Sweden. The project was undertaken as a close collaboration between General Electric of the U.S. and ASEA of Sweden, and the system was commissioned in 1970. With several upgrades of the converter stations in the intervening decades, the system now has a capacity of 3,100 MW and is known as the Pacific DC Intertie. The concept of a \\"super grid\\" dates back to the 1960s and was used to describe the emerging unification of the Great Britain grid. In the code that governs the British Grid, the Grid Code, the Supergrid is currently defined ‚Äì and has been since this code was first written, in 1990 ‚Äì as referring to those parts of the British electricity transmission system that are connected at voltages in excess of 200 kV (200,000 volts). British power system planners and operational staff therefore invariably speak of the Supergrid in this context; in practice the definition used captures all of the equipment owned by the National Grid company in England and Wales, and no other equipment. What has changed during the past 40 years is the scale of energy and distances that are imagined possible in a super grid. Europe began unifying its grids in the 1950s and its largest unified grid is the synchronous grid of Continental Europe serving 24 countries. Serious work is being conducted on unification of this synchronous European grid (previously known as the UCTE grid), with the neighboring synchronous transmission grid of some CIS countries, the IPS/UPS grid. If completed, the resulting massive grid would span 13 time zones stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. While such grids cover great distances, the capacity to transmit large volumes of electricity remains limited due to congestion and control issues. The SuperSmart Grid (Europe) and the Unified Smart Grid (US) specify major technological upgrades that proponents claim are necessary to assure the practical operation and promised benefits of such transcontinental mega grids. Concept In current usage, \\"super grid\\" has two senses ‚Äì one of being a superstructure layer overlaid or super-imposed upon existing regional transmission grid or grids, and the second of having some set of superior abilities exceeding those of even the most advanced grids. =Mega grid= In the \\"overlay\\", or \\"superstructure\\" meaning, a super grid is a very long-distance equivalent of a wide area synchronous network capable of large-scale transmission of renewable electricity. In some conceptions, a transmission grid of HVDC transmission lines forms a layer that is distinctly separate in the way that a superhighway system is separate from the system of city streets and regional highways. In more conventional conceptions such as the proposed unification of the synchronous European grid UCTE and the IPS/UPS system of the CIS, such a mega grid is no different from typical wide area synchronous transmission systems where electricity takes an ad hoc transit route directly through local utility transmission lines or HVDC lines as required. Studies for such continental sized systems report there are scaling problems as a result of network complexity, transmission congestion, and the need for rapid diagnostic, coordination and control systems. Such studies observe that transmission capacity would need to be significantly higher than current transmission systems in order to promote unimpeded energy trading across distances unbounded by state, regional or national, or even continental borders. As a practical matter, it has become necessary to incorporate smart grid features such as wide area sensor networks (WAMS) into even modest-sized regional grids in order to avert major power outages such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003. Dynamic interactions between power generation groups are increasingly complex, and transient disturbances that cascade across neighboring utilities can be sudden, large and violent, accompanied by abrupt changes in the network topology as operators attempt to manually stabilize the network. =Superior grid= In the second sense of an advanced grid, the super grid is superior not only because it is a wide area mega grid, but also because it is highly coordinated from a macro level spanning nations and continents, all the way down to the micro-level scheduling low priority loads like water heaters and refrigeration. In the European SuperSmart Grid proposal and the US Unified Smart Grid concept, such super grids have intelligence features in the wide- area transmission layer which integrate the local smart grids into a single wide-area super grid. This is similar to how the Internet bound together multiple small networks into a single ubiquitous network. Wide area transmission can be viewed as a horizontal extension of the smart grid. In a paradigm shift, the distinction between transmission and distribution blurs with the integration as energy flow becomes bidirectional. For example, distribution grids in rural areas might generate more energy than they use, turning the local smart grid into a virtual power plant, or a city's fleet of one million electric vehicles could be used to trim peaks in transmission supply by integrating them to the smart grid using vehicle to grid technology. thumb250pxA 765 kV AC transmission grid designed to carry 400 GW of wind power to cities from Midwest at a cost of $60 billion. One advantage of such a geographically dispersed and dynamically balanced system is that the need for baseload generation is significantly reduced since intermittency of some sources such as ocean, solar, and wind can be smoothed. A series of detailed modeling studies by Dr. Gregor Czisch, which looked at the European-wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids using HVDC cables, indicates that Europe's entire power usage could come from renewables, with 70% total energy from wind at the same level of cost or lower as at present. To some critics, such a wide area transmission layer is not novel; they point out that the technology has little difference from that used for regional and national power transmission networks. Proponents respond that beyond the qualitative smart grid features that allow instantaneous coordination and balancing of intermittent power sources across international boundaries, the quantitative comprehensiveness has a quality all its own. The claim is made that super grids open up markets. In the same way that freeways revolutionized interstate transport and the Internet revolutionized online commerce when comprehensive high-capacity networks were built, it is argued that a high capacity super grid must be built in order to provide a distribution network so comprehensive and with such available capacity that energy trading is only limited by how much electricity entrepreneurs can bring to market. Technology Wide area super grids plans typically call for bulk transmission using high voltage direct current lines. Europe's SuperSmart Grid proposal relies on HVDC, and in the US, key decision makers such as Steven Chu favor a national long distance DC grid system. A video of the presentation may also be found at the ARB site. There are industry advocates of HVAC. Although FACTS alternating current have drawbacks for long distances, American Electric Power has championed a 765 kV super grid they call I-765 that would provide 400 GW of extra transmission capacity required for producing 20% of US energy from wind farms based in the midwest. (See figure above). Advocates of HVAC point out that HVDC systems are oriented for point to point bulk transmission and multiple connections to them would require expensive complex communication and control equipment as opposed to the simple step up transformers needed if AC lines were used. Currently, there is only one multipoint long distance HVDC transmission system. In the more distant future, the voltage loss of current methods could be avoided using experimental superconducting \\"SuperGrid\\" technology where the transmission cable is cooled by a liquid hydrogen pipeline which is also used to move energy nationwide. The energy losses for creating, containing, and re-cooling liquid hydrogen needs to be accounted for. Coordination and control of the network would use smart grid technologies such as phasor measurement units to rapidly detect imbalances in the network caused by fluctuating renewable energy sources and potentially respond instantaneously with programmed automatic protection schemes to reroute, reduce load, or reduce generation in response to network disturbances. Government policy China supports the idea of a global, intercontinental super grid. For a super grid in the US, a study estimated an 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in combination with the installation of renewable energy, currently in planning stage. =Significant scale= One study for a European super grid estimates that as much as 750 GW of extra transmission capacity would be required ‚Äì capacity that would be accommodated in increments of 5 GW with HVDC lines. The paper was presented at the Claverton Energy conference in Bath, 24 October 2008. Paper Synopsis A recent proposal by Transcanada priced a 1,600-km, 3 GW HVDC line at US$3 billion; it would require a corridor 60 meters wide. In India, a recent 6 GW, 1,850-km proposal was priced at $790 million and would require a 69 meter wide right of way. Projected 38,236 rupee cost = US$790 million as of 2008-12-27. With 750 GW of new HVDC transmission capacity required for a European super grid, the land and money needed for new transmission lines would be considerable. =Energy independence= In Europe, the energy security implication of a super grid has been discussed as a way in part to prevent Russian energy hegemony. In the US, advocates such as T. Boone Pickens have promoted the idea of a national transmission grid in order to promote United States energy independence. Al Gore advocates the Unified Smart Grid which has comprehensive super grid capabilities. Gore and other advocates such as James E. Hansen believe super grids are essential for the eventual complete replacement of the greenhouse gas producing fossil fuel use that feeds global warming. =Permits for corridors= Large amounts of land would be required for the electricity transmission corridors used by the new transmission lines of a super grid. There can be significant opposition to the siting of power lines out of concerns about visual impact, anxiety over perceived health issues, and environmental concerns. The US has a process of designating National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, and it is likely that this process would be used to specify the pathways for a super grid in that country. In the EU, permits for new overhead lines can easily reach 10 years. In some cases, this has made underground cable more expedient. Since land required can be one fifth than that for overhead and the permit process can be significantly faster, underground cable can be more attractive despite its weaknesses of being more expensive, lower capacity, shorter-lived, and suffers significantly longer downtimes. Business interests =Siting= Just as superhighways change valuations of land due to the proximity to the ability to transport valuable commodities, businesses are strongly motivated to influence the siting of a super grid to their benefit. The cost of alternative power is the delivered price of electricity, and if the production of electricity from North Dakota wind or Arizona solar is to be competitive, the distance of the connection from the wind farm to the interstate transmission grid must not be great. This is because the feeder line from the generator to the transmission lines is usually paid for by the owner of the generation. Some localities will help pay for the cost of these lines, at the cost of local regulation such as that of a public utilities commission. T. Boone Pickens' project has chosen to pay for the feeder lines privately. Some localities, such as Texas give such projects the power of eminent domain which allows companies to seize land in the path of the planned construction. =Technology preferences= Energy producers are interested in whether the super grid employs HVDC technology, or uses AC, because the cost of connection to an HVDC line is generally greater than that if the AC is used. The Pickens plan favors 765 kV AC transmission, which is considered to be less efficient for long-distance transmission. =Competition= In the 1960s, private California power companies opposed the Pacific Intertie project with a set of technical objections that were overruled. When the project was completed, consumers in Los Angeles saved approximately U.S. $600,000 per day by use of electric power from projects on the Columbia River rather than local power companies burning more expensive fossil fuel.

Founded in the 1950s as a nuclear research center, Quehanna has a legacy of radioactive and toxic waste contamination, while also being the largest state forest wild area in Pennsylvania, with herds of elk. The wild area is bisected by the Quehanna Highway and is home to second growth forest with mixed hardwoods and evergreens. Quehanna has two state forest natural areas: the Wykoff Run Natural Area, and the Marion Brooks Natural Area. The latter has the largest stand of white birch in Pennsylvania and the eastern United States. The land that became Quehanna Wild Area was home to Native Americans, including the Susquehannock and Iroquois, before it was purchased by the United States in 1784. Settlers soon moved into the region and, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the logging industry cut the virgin forests; clearcutting and forest fires transformed the once verdant land into the \\"Pennsylvania Desert\\". Pennsylvania bought this land for its state forests, and in the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps worked to improve them. In 1955 the Curtiss-Wright Corporation bought of state forest to focus on developing nuclear-powered jet engines. They named their facility Quehanna for the nearby West Branch Susquehanna River, itself named for the Susquehannocks. Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, after which a succession of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including strontium-90 and cobalt-60. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30 million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and toxic waste was buried, some of which have been cleaned up while others were dug up by black bears and white-tailed deer. In 1970 the name was officially changed to Quehanna Wild Area, and later that decade the Quehanna Trail System was built through the wild area and surrounding state forests. Primitive camping by hikers is allowed, but the area has no permanent residents. The trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter, but closed to vehicles. Quehanna is on the Allegheny Plateau and was struck by a tornado in 1985. Defoliating insects have further damaged the forests. Quehanna Wild Area was named an Important Bird Area by the Pennsylvania Audubon Society, and is home to many species of birds and animals. Eco-tourists come to see the birds and elk, and hunters come for the elk, coyote, and other game.  History  = Native Americans = The Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks were the earliest recorded inhabitants of the West Branch Susquehanna River basin, which includes Quehanna Wild Area. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses.Wallace, \\"Indians in Pennsylvania\\", pp. 4‚Äì12, 84‚Äì89, 99‚Äì105, 145‚Äì148, 157‚Äì164. The Susquehannocks' numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the Iroquois exercised nominal control of the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. They also lived in long houses, primarily in what is now New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged such displaced eastern tribes as the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware) to settle in the West Branch watershed.Donehoo, pp. 215‚Äì220. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois hunted in much of Pennsylvania and the Quehanna area.Donehoo, pp. 177‚Äì183. The Iroquois and other tribes used the Great Shamokin Path, the major native east‚Äìwest path connecting the Susquehanna and Allegheny River basins, which passed south of what is now the wild area. The native village of Chinklacamoose (or Chingleclamouche) was on this path at the West Branch Susquehanna River, at what is now Clearfield to the southwest of Quehanna. The Sinnemahoning Path along Sinnemahoning Creek ran north of Quehanna; as the path with the gentlest grade, it may have been the route the first Paleo-Indians took entering this part of Pennsylvania from the west.Wallace, \\"Indian Paths in Pennsylvania\\", pp. 27‚Äì30, 66‚Äì72, 155‚Äì156. The French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) and the subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. In October 1784, the United States acquired a large tract of land, including what is now Quehanna Wild Area, from the Iroquois in the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this acquisition is known as the Last Purchase, as it completed the series of purchases from the resident Native American tribes of lands within the boundaries of Pennsylvania, initiated by William Penn and continued by his heirs. Although most of the Native Americans left this area of Pennsylvania, the state's Native American heritage can be found in many of its place names. The Susquehannocks were also known as the Susquehanna, from which the Susquehanna River and its West Branch obtained their names. In the 1950s the Curtiss- Wright Corporation coined the name \\"Quehanna\\" for its nuclear reservation, which it derived from the last three syllables of \\"Susquehanna\\",Fergus, pp. 117‚Äì120, 181‚Äì183. \\"in honor of the river that drained the entire region\\". Part of Quehanna Wild Area lies in the Moshannon State Forest, named for Moshannon Creek, which means \\"moose stream\\" or \\"elk stream\\" in the Lenape language.Donehoo, pp. 120‚Äì121. Sinnemahoning Creek's name means \\"stony salt lick\\" in Lenape.Donehoo, pp. 206‚Äì207. = Lumber era = Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, forests covered up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania: more than of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods. Scull's 1770 map of the Province of Pennsylvania showed the colonists' ignorance of the land north of the West Branch Susquehanna River; Sinnemahoning Creek was missing, and the region that includes Quehanna was labeled \\"Buffaloe Swamp\\".Seeley, p. 3.For a copy of Scull's 1770 map, please see here. This began to change when the land was purchased from the Iroquois in 1784, and became part of Northumberland County. In 1795 it became part of Lycoming County;Meginness, Chapter XIII. as the new county was divided into more townships, Quehanna became part of Chingleclamouche Township (named for the native village). Chingleclamouche Township was included in Clearfield County when it was established in 1804. Later it was divided between at least three counties and many townships, and no longer exists under that name. A splash dam discharging water and logs in the West Branch Susquehanna River basin The southern part of Quehanna Wild Area is now in parts of Covington, Girard, and Karthaus townships in Clearfield County; they were incorporated in 1817, 1832, and 1841. The northwest part of Quehanna is in Benezette Township in Elk County, established in 1843. The northeast part of Quehanna is in Cameron County (incorporated in 1860) in Gibson Township, which was formed in 1804 while part of Clearfield County. The first European American settlers arrived in Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, and the first sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.Seeley, pp. 4‚Äì6. A logging train of the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Co., which clearcut the Quehanna plateau from 1907 to 1911 As lumber became an industry in Pennsylvania, the rivers and creeks were declared public highways by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. This permitted their use to float logs to sawmills and markets. Log booms were placed on the West Branch Susquehanna River to catch the floating timber; Lock Haven built a boom in 1849, and Williamsport's Susquehanna Boom opened in 1851.Taber, Chapter 2. Businesses purchased vast tracts of land and built splash dams on the creeks; these dams controlled water in small streams that would otherwise be unable to carry logs and rafts. For example, in 1871 a single splash dam on the Bennett Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek could release enough water to produce a wave high on the main stem for two hours. Mosquito Creek, which drains much of the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, had at least nine splash dams in its watershed.Seeley, p. 16. This was the predominant lumber transport system in the Quehanna region from 1865 to 1885 and after 1850, five different kinds of lumber rafts could be found on its streams and river. Much of the timber was too remote to be transported via the streams, and logging railroads were the next development in the Quehanna lumber era. In or around 1880, these railroads allowed the clearcutting of the remaining forests. The Quehanna plateau was unusual in using standard gauge track for its logging railroads: most such railways were narrow gauge. The logging railroads used special geared steam locomotives, such as the Shay, Climax and Heisler.Seeley, pp. 6‚Äì7. Nine companies operated logging railroads in what became Moshannon State Forest; the Goodyear Lumber Company was the largest and cut much of what became Quehanna Wild Area between 1902 and 1912. The Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company logged land in the northern part of the wild area between 1907 and 1911. Note: this is a map on one side and an informational brochure on the other side. Clearcutting led to the \\"Pennsylvania Desert\\". There were only two major roads on the Quehanna plateau in the 19th and early 20th centuries, both originally turnpikes. The Caledonia Pike ran east‚Äìwest from Bellefonte to Smethport, and passed south of what became the wild area, while the Driftwood Pike ran from near Karthaus north to Driftwood on the Sinnemahoning, and passed through the wild area.Seeley, pp. 9, 12. Wagon trains and railroads brought supplies to the lumber camps in the woods; some wood hicks set up small farms on cleared land that also provided food. There were at least eight farms in Quehanna, though they were not very productive because of \\"poorly drained acid soil and a short growing season\\". The lumber era in Quehanna did not last; the old-growth and second-growth forests were clearcut by the early 20th century. Fire had always been a hazard; the sparks from logging steam engines started many wildfires, and more wood may have been lost to fires than to logging in some areas. On the clearcut land nothing remained except the discarded, dried-out tree tops, which were very flammable; much of the land burned and was left barren. The soil was depleted of nutrients, fires baked the ground hard, and jungles of blueberries, blackberries, and mountain laurel covered the clearcut land, which became known as the \\"Pennsylvania Desert\\".Owlett, pp. 53‚Äì62. = State forests = Old Hoover Road, a hiking trail in Wykoff Run Natural Area, was originally the Driftwood Pike, then a state forest road. As the timber was exhausted and the land burned, many companies abandoned their holdings. Conservationists such as Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow without proper management. They called for a change in the philosophy of forest management and for the state to purchase land from the lumber companies. In 1895, Rothrock was appointed the first forestry commissioner in what became the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR). In 1897, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations\\", and the first of the Pennsylvania state forest lands were acquired the following year.Thorpe, pp. 2‚Äì4, 7‚Äì10. The state first bought land that became the Moshannon State Forest in 1898; the second purchase, and first in the Quehanna region, was in the Three Runs area, acquired for $1 an acre ($2.47 a hectare) in 1900. Three smaller state forests (Karthaus, Sinnemahoning, and Moshannon) were merged to form the present Moshannon State Forest; in 1997, the forest covered . The first purchase for the Elk State Forest was made in 1900, and by 1997 it encompassed . Forty-six percent, or , of the total of Quehanna Wild Area lies in the Elk State Forest. The remainder lies in the Moshannon State Forest. The state established a tree nursery in the Moshannon State Forest in 1911, which became the largest in Pennsylvania before it closed in 1980. In addition to planting millions of trees, in 1913 the state encouraged use of state forest lands by allowing permanent leases for camp sites; when the state stopped issuing new permits in 1970, 4,500 campsites had been leased. The Pennsylvania Game Commission began purchasing land for state game preserves in 1920, and by 1941, State Game Lands 34, which is partly in Quehanna Wild Area, had been established. Despite these conservation efforts, major forest fires swept the Moshannon and Elk state forests in 1912, 1913, 1926, and 1930, and minor fires occurred in other years.Thorpe, pp. 16‚Äì18, 32, 59‚Äì61, 71‚Äì73. Men of Civilian Conservation Corps Camp S118, who worked in the Quehanna area During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) established ten camps in Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The young men of the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which continued to be a problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.Speakman, Appendix.Paige, Chapter One. Other Depression-era public works projects shaped the area. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) had at least two camps for World War I veterans in the Quehanna area, and built the Karthaus emergency landing field for airmail planes, similar to those that became Mid-State Regional Airport and Cherry Springs Airport. The airfield was built in 1935 and 1936 along Hoover Road (the old Driftwood Pike), just north of what is now Wykoff Run Natural Area. During World War II, the landing strip was blocked to prevent enemy planes from secretly landing there.Seeley, pp. 14, 28.Sayers, p. 77. In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association was founded to promote conservation in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid from the trees used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).Seeley, pp. 10, 23.Sayers, pp. 37‚Äì41, 105‚Äì113. = Atoms for Peace = The pool reactor in Curtiss-Wright's research facility. The nuclear core is in the water, and the control panel is on the bridge. In a December 8, 1953 speech to the United Nations, President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced a new Atoms for Peace policy, and Congress enacted his program into law the following year. Atoms for Peace \\"made funding accessible to anyone who had the imagination, if not the ability, to harness the atom's power for peaceful purposes\\". Under the new program, the airplane manufacturer Curtiss-Wright Corporation sought a large isolated area in central Pennsylvania \\"for the development of nuclear-powered jet engines and to conduct research in nucleonics, metallurgy, ultrasonics, electronics, chemicals and plastics\\".Stranahan, p. 188. Curtiss-Wright worked closely with the state, and in June 1955, Governor George M. Leader signed legislation that authorized the construction of a research facility at Quehanna. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold Curtiss-Wright for $181,250 ($22.50 an acre, $55.60 a hectare), and gave the company a 99-year lease on the remaining at $30,000 a year. Curtiss-Wright controlled in a regular 16-sided polygon, which was easier to fence than a circular area. The state constructed $1.6 million of roads to the area; the Quehanna Highway was built on parts of an old CCC road, which followed an earlier logging railroad grade. Pennsylvania also canceled 212 camp site leases to help ensure security for the installation. Curtiss- Wright built three facilities on its land. The first was a nuclear research center with a nuclear reactor and six shielded radiation containment chambers for handling radioactive isotopes, referred to as hot cells, at the end of Reactor Road. The second was for jet engine trials, and had two test cells with bunkers just north of Quehanna Highway, about apart. The northern test cell was at the center of the 16-sided polygon; even if a jet engine broke its moorings, it could not leave the polygonal area. Both of these were on the land which Curtiss-Wright had purchased, which was a regular octagon surrounded with a fence built by forest rangers, supervised from three guard houses on Quehanna Highway and Wykoff Run Road. The third installation was an industrial complex at the southeast edge of the polygon, in Karthaus Township, on the Quehanna Highway. At this site, a Curtiss-Wright division manufactured Curon foam for furniture and household products and used beryllium oxide to make high-temperature ceramics for application in the nuclear industry.Seeley, pp. 12‚Äì13. 1958 aerial view of the reactor and jet engine test cells In 1956 Curtiss-Wright began isotope work at the facility, and The New York Times published two stories on the new nuclear research laboratory that year, followed by a November 1957 report that the one-megawatt nuclear reactor was completed. In 1958, the corporation received a twenty-year license from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to operate a four-megawatt open pool nuclear research reactor, and received permission from the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board to dispose of some radioactive waste in Meeker Run, a tributary of Mosquito Creek.Stranahan, pp. 188‚Äì193, 211‚Äì212. The project was billed as \\"the greatest thing that ever happened in North Central Pennsylvania\\", and was expected to employ between 7,000 and 8,000 people. Curtiss-Wright spent $30 million on the project, and developed a community for its scientific and technical staff at the village of Pine Glen, southeast of Karthaus in Centre County. By 1960 the Air Force had decided not to pursue nuclear-powered aircraft, and the federal government canceled $70 million in \\"high-altitude testing contracts\\" with Curtiss-Wright. By June 1960, the reactor was on standby and only 750 employees remained, 400 of whom were in the Curon foam division; many engineers and scientists had already left. On August 20, 1960, Curtiss-Wright announced that it was donating the reactor facility to Penn State and selling its Curon foam division; the remaining 235 employees lost their jobs. Penn State, located about an hour south of Quehanna, had its own nuclear reactor, but intended to use the Quehanna facility for research and training. The Curtis-Wright reactor was dismantled and its fuel returned to the AEC. Martin Company, which soon became Martin Marietta, leased the hot cells, intending to use them in the manufacture of small radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Curtiss-Wright warned Penn State \\"that the radiation involved in Martin's operations would be 'extremely high' and of a type that posed a particular risk to human health\\", but Curtiss-Wright itself had left both solid and liquid radioactive waste in the facility. Some of the Curtiss-Wright waste was contaminated with toxic beryllium oxide. Penn State had acquired the reactor license, and with it came legal responsibility for the nuclear waste on the site; its plan with the AEC called for the release of 90 percent of the liquid radioactive waste into the environment and the burial of most radioactive solids on site. Items coated with beryllium oxide dust \\"were covered in plastic and buried out in the woods\\", where some were unearthed by black bears and white-tailed deer.Sayers, p. 72. Once jet engine testing stopped, the bunkers at the test cells were used \\"to store hazardous and explosive material\\". The hot cells in the facility were used to remotely handle materials too radioactive to deal with directly. In 1962 Martin Marietta began to manufacture Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) thermoelectric generators under a contract with the AEC; their AEC license allowed them to have up to 6 million curies of radioactive strontium-90 in the form of strontium titanate, which powered the SNAP generators. A SNAP-7 reactor made at Quehanna was used in the world's first nuclear-powered lighthouse, the Baltimore Harbor Light, from May 1964 to April 1966. In early 1963, Curtiss-Wright still owned or leased all of Quehanna and sublet land along Quehanna Highway to a firm that recovered copper from wire by burning off its insulation, a procedure that contaminated the soil. On July 12, 1963, Governor William Scranton announced the termination of Curtiss-Wright's lease on ; the state paid the company for the roads it had built, and Curtiss-Wright donated six of the eight buildings in the industrial complex to the state.Sayers, pp. 53‚Äì59. In 1965 the state legislature passed an act declaring the former leased area a wilderness area, and Maurice K. Goddard, secretary of the Department of Forests and Waters, named it the Quehanna Wilderness Area.Sayers, p. 61. Although Martin Marietta completed its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, it had to stay at the reactor site \\"until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels\\". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found \\"licensable quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and residual radioactivity in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies\\". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did raise questions about the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia. Many in the conservation movement urged the state to buy back the land, especially after the Curtiss- Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land was back in the state forests and state game lands. = Protected area and reclamation =  Reactor facility  In 1967, Pennsylvania leased the reactor complex to the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC), which already had a federal license to work with nuclear materials. NUMEC, which soon became a subsidiary of Atlantic-Richfield Corporation (ARCO), set up a large irradiator in what had been the reactor pool. The irradiator contained over 1 million curies of cobalt-60 to produce intense gamma rays, which were used to sterilize medical equipment and irradiate food and wood. In the spring of 1967 the state had concluded that radiation contamination at the Quehanna site \\"could never be completely cleaned up\\", and so was glad to find a tenant with nuclear experience. The robot which disassembled the most contaminated parts of the facility in action A group of NUMEC employees discovered that irradiating hardwood treated with plastics produced very durable flooring. In 1978 they formed PermaGrain Products, Inc. as a separate company from ARCO, and purchased the rights to the process as well as \\"the main irradiator, a smaller shielded irradiator and related equipment\\". PermaGrain sold the flooring for use in basketball courts and gymnasiums, and was the longest occupant of the Quehanna facility, operating there from 1978 to December 2002. PermaGrain also let Neutron Products, Inc., a Maryland company, do cobalt-60 work in its hot cells, which required an amendment of their license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the successor to the AEC).Sayers, p. 64. In 1993, strontium-90 contamination in the reactor facility led the NRC to require PermaGrain to begin decontamination work, and the Pennsylvania DEP commissioned a \\"site characterization study\\". In 1998, a firm named NES began the cleanup work; they changed their name to Scientech in 1999 and to EnergySolutions in 2006. The cleanup was originally estimated to take six months; by 2006 it had taken 8 years and cost $30 million. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Bureau of Radiation Protection: \\"Inadequate characterization of the site and the presence of ongoing industrial operations resulted in many project delays and increased costs.\\" The hot cells proved to have more radioactive sources than originally thought. In October 1998 a Scientech worker doing decontamination cut a tube in hot cell number 4, which accidentally released strontium-90 into PermaGrain's work area. As a result, a robot had to be constructed to remove 3,000 curies of cobalt-60 in two of the hot cells, dismantle cell 4, and decontaminate the rest remotely. Reactor Road in 2010; even though the reactor has been demolished, access to the site by vehicles is still restricted. After the accidental release, another radiological survey was performed, and the state government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its plans for a new building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995. When PermaGrain went bankrupt, about 100,000 curies of cobalt-60 were abandoned at the reactor facility, which was now under the control of Pennsylvania's government. The DEP assumed responsibility for the NRC license and legacy contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), working with the NRC and state, removed the cobalt-60 from the site for disposal at the low-level radioactive waste facility in Barnwell, South Carolina in September 2003. Scientech continued decontamination work and demolished the hot cells; much of this work was done robotically, with financial aid from the Department of Energy. The cleanup was thought finished, so a final survey was done in December 2004, and a Final Status Survey Report was filed in February 2005. However, when the NRC and scientists from the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education surveyed the facility in May 2005, they found many areas of contamination above the legal limits. According to the NRC's Quehanna Site Status Summary, strontium-90 had contaminated the \\"buildings as well as ... surface and subsurface soil\\" but was not in groundwater. More cleanup work was done in the summer of 2005, but the site still did not meet NRC regulations. DEP concluded that \\"some type of migration of radioactive material [was] taking place in the concrete at the facility\\", and changed its disposal plan. The new plan called for demolition of the building without completing decontamination, and disposal of the above ground material in a regular landfill. This plan was approved by the NRC in October 2006, and a December 2006 survey showed \\"that the above grade structure met the release limits\\" of the disposal plan. The former reactor structure was demolished, and on May 13, 2009 the NRC released the state from its license for the site. As of 2011, a small octagonal \\"restricted area\\" around the reactor site is still shown on official DCNR maps. and Maps, 1 inch = approximately 2 miles. Retrieved March 24, 2011.  Contamination and cleanup  Part of the former southern jet engine test cell bunker, which has been almost completely covered with earth On September 20, 1967, two Bureau of Forestry employees attempted to remove a metal ladder from a metal storage tank for jet fuel at the northern jet engine test cell. Both were killed in an explosion when the acetylene torch cut through the tank wall and ignited fumes inside it. A tract within the Elk State Forest at the northern edge of the wild area is known as Noble-Chambers Memorial Forest in their memory.Sayers, p. 49.Seeley, p. 29. Although Fergus reports entering a bunker in his 2002 book, and Young describes a bunker's slit windows in his 2008 book,Young, p. 127. as of 2010 the southern bunker was covered with earth, and the northern bunker is still completely intact and can be entered. In 1986, former Curtiss-Wright and Martin Marietta employees testified about hazards and waste disposal practices before a hearing of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A former employee told how a night watchman walked through a spill in the reactor complex without knowing it; the man's car and the carpets in his house had to be destroyed as a result of the contamination. Others told about burying hundreds of drums of unknown waste from the reactor facility and digging a trench and deep for waste drums north of Wykoff Run Road. The locations of some sites, which included radioactive waste, beryllium oxide, and other toxic compounds, were not recorded. A forest ranger testified that he had dismantled a CCC-built drinking water fountain fed by a spring because it was downhill from the reactor and he feared people might drink contaminated water from it.Sayers, p. 75. In 1964, drilling revealed that the Quehanna Wild Area's geology and hydrology made it unsuitable for burying waste. However, according to Seeley's Great Buffaloe Swamp, a history of the Quehanna region, there are 180 contamination sites in the wild area. Waste has been found at the former air field, within the Wykoff Run Natural Area, near the industrial complex, at the former Lincoln Farm, and at the copper wire-burning site on the highway. These last three waste sites were cleaned in 1991 at a cost of $187,698. At the wire-burning site of contaminated soil were removed from , with clean earth and grass seed placed on top of the area. The waste was also removed from the farm site, but at the industrial complex the waste was covered with of soil on and fenced off.Sayers, pp. 85‚Äì86.  Piper complex and boot camp  Aerial view of the industrial complex during the Curtiss-Wright era; the Quehanna Highway runs north-south. The industrial complex covers about on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.Sayers, pp. 64‚Äì65. The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a heavy equipment training school at Piper, which is still in operation. In 1992 the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections opened the Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp at Piper as the state's \\"first military-style motivational boot camp\\". The minimum security program for non-violent, first-time offenders has accepted both male and female inmates from the start. Originally designed to house 200, the Department of Corrections expanded the facility in the late 1990s to a capacity of 500 on about . The inmates spend six months in a military-style program that offers opportunities for education and builds positive life skills; they also are offered drug and alcohol therapy. Those who successfully complete the boot camp program, which is considered an alternative to prison, are released on parole. The boot camp began to receive men and women from the \\"general population of state prison inmates\\" in 2005 and 2006, respectively. At the end of June 2009, the facility had 494 inmates, 61 percent of whom were in the boot camp program, and cost just over $17 million a year to operate.  Wild area  Wildlife viewing blind at Hoover Farm Wildlife Viewing Area In December 1970 the state forest commission officially changed the designation from Quehanna Wilderness Area to Quehanna Wild Area, making it the first state forest wild area in Pennsylvania.Sayers, p. 62. Elk and Moshannon state forests jointly administer Quehanna's ; for comparison, this is over three times larger than the area of Manhattan, making Quehanna the largest of the 16 wild areas in the state. According to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, \\"a wild area is an extensive area, which the general public will be permitted to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing. No development of a permanent nature will be permitted in order to retain the undeveloped character of the area. These areas will be administered according to the principals of forest protection...\\". Consequently, within a wild area, no new permanent camp leases, mines, wells, roads, or rights-of-way for utility lines are allowed, although existing camps, roads, and rights-of-way may remain. Vehicles are allowed only on public roads; trails are limited to hikers, bicyclists, equestrians, and wheelchairs, and only primitive camping by backpackers is allowed. Quehanna has two paved roads open to vehicles, and is crossed by rights-of-way for three electrical power lines and two natural gas pipelines. It is one of the largest areas in Pennsylvania without permanent inhabitants. mountain laurel on the Quehanna Trail, built 1976‚Äì1977 The state forest system also has natural areas, with more restricted usage. According to the Bureau of Forestry, \\"A natural area is an area of unique scenic, historic, geologic or ecological value that will be maintained in a natural condition by allowing physical and biological processes to operate, usually without direct human intervention.\\" Quehanna Wild Area contains two state forest natural areas: the Wykoff Run Natural Area in the center, and the Marion Brooks Natural Area on the northwest edge. Note: this includes four chapters on sites within the Quehanna Wild Area, Marion Brooks Natural Area (3), Beaver Run Dam Wildlife Viewing Area (4), Hoover Farm Wildlife Viewing Area (5), and Wykoff Run Natural Area (6). Marion Brooks Natural Area, known for its stand of white birch, was formerly known as Paige Run Natural Area; in 1975 it was renamed for Marion E. Brooks, a pioneering environmentalist from Elk County.McGeehan, p. 113. Quehanna Wild Area also has two wildlife viewing areas with blinds for observing elk and other animals: Beaver Run Dam's pond and wetlands and Hoover Farm's fields and feeding plots. The Quehanna plateau is home to the Quehanna Trail System, a loop hiking trail, of which are in Quehanna Wild Area. The trail was built in 1976 and 1977 with help from a federally funded jobs program, the Young Adult Conservation Corps, and the Pennsylvania Conservation Corps. As of 2010 it is maintained by the Quehanna Area Trails Club. Parts of the trail have been moved, away from damage caused by the 1985 tornado, to avoid pipelines, to circumvent the Piper Boot Camp, and to pass closer to streams.Seeley, pp. 3, 8, 12.Thwaites, pp. 209‚Äì216. The wild area also has six shallow ponds for waterfowl and other wildlife, the result of dams built on marshy areas in the 1970s.Seeley, pp. 60‚Äì61. In 1997 the whole Quehanna Wild Area was declared Pennsylvania Important Bird Area #31 by the Pennsylvania Audubon Society. In 2003, the Bureau of Forestry proposed expanding the Quehanna Wild Area by incorporating more of the surrounding Elk and Moshannon State Forests. Despite efforts to restrict use, some environmentalists criticize Quehanna's administration. Christopher Klyza, author of Wilderness Comes Home: Rewilding the Northeast, notes that the Pennsylvania wild areas are not true wilderness areas. He is especially critical of the continued use of roads through the wild areas and limited logging allowed \\"for forest health and wildlife habitat improvements\\".Klyza, p. 86.  Geology and climate  From its source in Wykoff Run Natural Area, Wykoff Run drops through four rock formations.Shaw, p. 151. Quehanna Wild Area lies at an elevation of on the Allegheny Plateau. The area falls into portions of two distinct geological physiographic provinces, with all but the northernmost part in the Pittsburgh Low Plateau, known for its coal and mineral deposits, and characterized by steep-cut stream beds. The northernmost part of the wild area, including Marion Brooks Natural Area, is in the Deep Valleys section, home to some of the most remote and wild areas of the state; streams here have cut deep valleys with steep-sided slopes. In the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, the Mosquito Creek gorge is up to deep, and the Red Run gorge in the north is almost deep.Mitchell, pp. 169‚Äì171. The Allegheny Plateau formed in the Alleghenian orogeny some 300 million years ago, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and leaving the hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.Van Diver, pp. 31‚Äì35, 113‚Äì115Shultz, pp. 372‚Äì374, 391, 399, 818 At least five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods are present in Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations are found in the valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff-colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation. The Allegheny Plateau has a continental climate, with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges (the difference between the daily high and low) of 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C) in winter and 26 ¬∞F (14 ¬∞C) in summer. Quehanna Wild Area is part of the Mosquito Creek and Wykoff Run watersheds, where the mean annual precipitation is .Shaw, pp. 143, 151 Weather records are not available for Quehanna Wild Area, but they are known for the nearby village of Karthaus. The highest recorded temperature at Karthaus was in 2011, and the record low was in 1994. On average, January is the coldest month, July is the hottest month, and June is the wettest month. = 1985 tornado = Looking west on the Quehanna Highway at the Clearfield‚ÄìCameron county line, where the 1985 tornado crossed the road On May 31, 1985, an outbreak of 43 tornadoes struck northeastern Ohio, western and central Pennsylvania, New York, and southern Ontario, killing 88 people. The Storm Data Center of the National Weather Service rated the outbreak \\"the 12th most 'significant' tornado event of all time\\". Pennsylvania was struck by 17 tornadoes that Memorial Day, including the only F5 tornado on the Fujita scale in the state's history. The tornadoes caused 65 deaths in Pennsylvania and were not dissipated by the state's mountainous landscape, \\"forever putting to rest the myth that such terrain can deter them\\". An F4 tornado passed through Quehanna Wild Area; its path of destruction crossed the Quehanna Highway at the Clearfield‚ÄìCameron county line.Grazulis, p. 203. It traveled over of mainly dense forest and wilderness in central Pennsylvania, and damaged or destroyed buildings early in its life, including a CCC-built lodge at Parker Dam State Park. The damage path from this storm was estimated to be at least wide. Its winds‚Äî‚Äîripped up small and medium-sized trees and shrubs, tore leaves and limbs from some of the big trees, and snapped others like matchsticks. As it headed west through Moshannon State Forest in Clearfield and Centre counties, Gregory S. Forbes, then a meteorology professor at Penn State, said the debris from the tornado was visible on his WSR-57 radar scanners. The reactor building was just north of the tornado's path and suffered $200,000 in damage, but no radiation leaks occurred.Sayers, pp. 89‚Äì90. The tornado outbreak injured more than 1,000 people and caused $450 million in total damages and destruction. Moshannon State Forest lost an estimated $8 million in lumber to the tornado that hit Quehanna; after the storm, $2 million in timber was salvaged in the state forest.Seeley, p. 14. In the ensuing years, the affected forest at Quehanna, though younger and smaller than the surrounding woods, has partly recovered. The official map for the Quehanna Trail is labeled \\"tornado zone\\" where the twister passed through the wild area. Stumps from logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in a wetland area north of Reactor Road  Ecology  = Flora = The virgin forests of what became Quehanna Wild Area were different in composition and quality than those of today. Eastern white pine and eastern hemlock were more common, often found on shady slopes and damp areas on plateaus. Chestnut oak and pitch pine favored slopes that were sandy or rocky, and the forest had a mixture of hardwoods, including ash, beech, birch, chestnut, maple, and yellow poplar. Each of these virgin forests could produce up to of white pine and of hemlock and hardwoods. For comparison, the same area of forest today produces a total of on average. The virgin forests cooled the land and streams. Centuries of accumulated organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the streams, so they flowed more evenly year- round.Dillon, pp. 23‚Äì24, 46. Second-growth trees in Moshannon State Forest The clearcutting and repeated fires changed all of this. New growth was often composed of different plants and trees than had originally been there. Near Beaver Run in Quehanna there are wetlands that were originally hemlock forest. Hemlocks transpire large amounts of water and once they were gone the soil was too wet to support most trees; the bracken and ferns that replaced the hemlocks altered the soil qualities to discourage trees as well.Seeley, pp. 21‚Äì22. Within the Quehanna Wild Area are wetlands. Fires and erosion removed nutrients from the soil, and in some areas the soil was so poor in nutrients that only white birch, a pioneer species, would grow there. Marion Brooks Natural Area has the largest stand of white birch in Pennsylvania and the eastern United States. These trees are now 80 to 90 years old and reaching the end of their lifespans. Besides forest fires and tornado damage, there have been other threats to Quehanna's forests in the 20th century. Many trees were lost when chestnut blight wiped out the American chestnut trees by 1925; in the Quehanna area, this species constituted between one-quarter and one-half of the hardwoods. In the 1960s, white and chestnut oak trees had high mortality from pit scale insects and associated fungi. Larvae of oak leaf roller moths, which defoliate oaks, first appeared on of Quehanna Wild Area in the late 1960s; at their peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s they had defoliated of Moshannon State Forest and in Elk State Forest, with moderate to heavy tree mortality. A similar pest, oak leaf tier, stripped of oaks in Elk State Forest by 1970. The gypsy moth defoliated over of deciduous trees in the 1970s and 1980s. The forests within the Quehanna Important Bird Area are 84 percent hardwoods, 4 percent mixed hardwood and evergreens, less than 1 percent evergreens, 7 percent transitional between forests and fields, and 3 percent perennial herbaceous plants. As well as trees, the forests have blueberry and huckleberry bushes and thickets of mountain laurel and rhododendron. = Fauna = Some animals, previously present in abundance, have disappeared, or the populations declined, through habitat loss. By 1912, after the forests had been clearcut, Quehanna was covered by \\"vast expanses of brush, created when the root systems of cut-off trees sprouted up through the discarded tops and limbs of the logged forest\\". Once the forest fires were controlled, this brush offered habitat for many game species. By the early 1940s, the CCC had thinned brush in many areas, and the forest had matured. Shade from the canopy decreased brush in the understory. By the early 21st century, many of the trees in Quehanna were 80 to 100 years old, and the maturation of the forests led to the disappearance of species like bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare; white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, black squirrel, and cottontail rabbit all became less common. Efforts by the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association (MCSA) to reintroduce bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare have been unsuccessful.Sayers, pp. 100‚Äì101.Audubon Pennsylvania, pp. 19‚Äì20. Other animals became locally extinct through overhunting. The last elk in Pennsylvania was killed in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the Rocky Mountains to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area. Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so concerned about declining numbers of white-tailed deer that it imported nearly 1,200 animals from Michigan to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959. In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity. By the early 20th century, the fisher, a small mammal similar to the European polecat or American marten, was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190 animals were released in five sites in the northern part of the state, including 23 animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995. Breeding populations of fisher appear to have been reestablished. Pond and wetlands at Beaver Run Wildlife Viewing Area Still other animals seem to thrive regardless of the maturity of the forest or the presence of the understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red- spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.Seeley, p. 8.Sayers, pp. 34‚Äì39, 113‚Äì115. As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's forests are recognized as a \\"large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species\\" and are home to 102 species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.  Recreation  alt=A deep, winding valley stretches to the level horizon under a blue sky. The lands is covered by red- tinged trees, and a few bare trees are in the foreground. According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".McDonald, p. 158.Seeley's book is a very detailed guide to the Quehanna Trail, two connectors, and side trails. Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright.Sayers, pp. 50‚Äì51, 55. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white- tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock. The Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association has sponsored an annual coyote hunt each winter hunt since 1992. The club has also provided food plots for deer and elk, fed game animals in winter, planted and pruned fruit trees, stocked fish, and treated streams for acid rain. Fishing is primarily for trout.Sayers, pp. 101‚Äì116, 137‚Äì145. The Quehanna Wild Area is also seen, used, and enjoyed by bird watchers attracted by its status as an Important Bird Area. Audubon Pennsylvania and the DCNR have prepared the Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail guide which lists three sites in Quehanna: Wykoff Run, Beaver Run Wildlife Viewing Area, and the whole wild area. The DCNR has published a guide to Elk Scenic Drive which lists 23 attractions, four in Quehanna: Marion Brooks and Wykoff Run Natural Areas, and Beaver Run and Hoover Farm Wildlife Viewing Areas.

It is now known as St. Ignatius Church and Cemetery. The manor house complex is recognized as the oldest Jesuit residence in the world to have been continuously occupied by that order. The mission settlement of Chapel Point was started in 1641 by Father Andrew White, S.J., an English Jesuit missionary. He administered to the Potapoco Native Americans, some of whom he converted to Catholicism. Established in 1662, this is the oldest continuously active Roman Catholic parish in the Thirteen Colonies of North America founded by Great Britain. With the consecration in 1794 of Bishop John Carroll, St. Thomas became the first Roman Catholic see in the United States. Description The house is a two-story, seven-bay, brick structure of Georgian architecture, of Flemish bond construction. The mansion is the oldest surviving example of the Georgian style in Maryland. The manor house was built in 1741 as the headquarters of the Maryland Mission of the Society of Jesus, replacing an earlier structure. It served as the Superior's and later the Provincial's official residence. This house was also the nucleus of other missions in Maryland and the mid- Atlantic region. Connected to the manor house stands a two-story brick wing that incorporates a former chapel built in 1798, now called St. Ignatius Church. Outbuildings are also significant, including a small, mid-19th century wood-frame slaves' quarter, \\"one of remarkably few such buildings to survive in this area.\\" In addition, the former corn crib is the \\"largest structure of its type recorded in Charles County, and one that exhibits many construction features not represented elsewhere.\\" Cemetery at St. Ignatius Church, Chapel Point, Charles County, MD. The Port Tobacco River flows from the right to the Potomac River at far left. A cemetery lies to the west of the manor house and church. Notable parishioners are buried there, including a Confederate agent, Olivia Floyd, and US Congressmen, Sydney Emanuel Mudd, William M Digges, and Sydney Emanuel Mudd II.\\"Mudd, Sydney Emanuel \\", Maryland Biographical Dictionary, pp. 388-389 St. Thomas Manor was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Due to its history and scenic waterfront setting, the manor grounds, church and cemetery attract visitors from distant places. They make up a favorite rest-stop for many bicycle tour groups. Additional significance In 1794 it was at St. Thomas Manor that John Carroll was invested in his robes as the first Catholic bishop of the United States of America, after the nation gained independence in the Revolutionary War. (He later traveled to London for official consecration as a bishop by the Vicar Apostolic.) This investiture established St. Thomas as the first Roman Catholic see in the United States. The St. Thomas complex was also the site of the revival of the Jesuit order in the United States in 1805, after it had been suppressed by the Catholic Church in 1773. Three American priests took their vows at St. Ignatius Church. The Jesuits of the Maryland Province who resided at St. Thomas Manor sold several members of the Georgetown 272 in 1838. In a letter, William McSherry, S.J. estimated that the sale of the enslaved persons would amount to approximately $16,000. The money from this sale went to repay the debts of the struggling Georgetown College (now Georgetown University) in Washington, D.C. The Maryland Province Jesuits opposed the slave trade, but not slavery in practice. Because of this, they frequently sold enslaved individuals in order to repay debts and raise money to support the Jesuit Missions and Georgetown College. Catholic Church and Indian records During the years of slavery and after the American Civil War, when most southern governments classified people as only black or white in a binary system related to the racial caste of slavery, St. Ignatius was among the Catholic parishes that continued to record their Native congregational members as Indian, regardless of whether they were of mixed race. In colonial and United States records, by contrast, the tribal identities of some Native Americans were lost when they were classified by outsiders as free people of color, \\"colored,\\" or \\"white,\\" regardless of how they identified ethnically. Research in Catholic records has helped some tribes document their continuous cultural history and identification as Native American, and to gain state and federal recognition as tribes since the late 20th century.Helen C.

He attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law and graduated in 1987. From 1984 to 1992, Harris served as an intelligence officer and judge advocate general in the United States Army. He resigned his commission in 1992 and subsequently joined the administration of Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, where he served in many senior management positions and ultimately as budget director from 1996 to 2005.

Harris resigned days later. Harris would enter a guilty plea soon after his arrest and was granted a deal after he agreed to testify against Blagojevich.http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wpvi/flash/news/blagojevichtrial/relationshipMaping.xml In a subsequent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit regarding the convictions of former Governor Blagojevich, the court reversed a conviction for the former governor based on the wire fraud count which had been the sole basis of Harris' guilty plea. The court noted that the practice of \\"logrolling\\" for political purposes, including the trading of favors like jobs, was not criminal activity. This has led legal and political commentators to speculate that Harris may have plead guilty to conduct which was not criminal at all. However, it is unclear if Harris is left with any legal remedy to clear himself. On March 28, 2012, Harris was sentenced by judge James B. Zagel. In contrast to the 14-year sentence Judge Zagel previously handed down to former Governor Blagojevich, Harris was sentenced to a period of 10 days' incarceration, two years' supervised release and a $1,000 fine. In imposing the unusually lenient sentence, Judge Zagel noted that the former Governor had worn down his staff and demonstrated signs of \\"mental instability.\\" Judge Zagel observed that other than leaving the administration earlier if he were in Harris's shoes, he might have acted the same way. The judge also acknowledged an unusual number of character reference letters in support of Harris that had been received from prominent city and state political and business figures.

His interests were mainly in railways, where he served Inspector of Railways and a railway company director but also in water and iron working. He was also a Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1892. Early life Tyler was born in Mayfair, London, the son of John Chatfield Tyler and attended the Royal Military Academy Woolwich.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 He joined the Royal Engineers and in 1851 was a lieutenant called upon by Henry Cole to assist with the organisation of the Great Exhibition. In 1860 he donated a set of prospectuses to the State Library of Victoria.

The former involved failure of cast iron beams supporting the track in a wooden bridge, through which a coal train fell, killing the driver and stoker instantly. The Clayton tunnel crash involved a collision in the tunnel and was the worst rail disaster at the time, killing 24 passengers in the rear coaches. He also reported on the Bull bridge accident when yet another cast iron girder failed suddenly as a train was passing over. His expertise was called upon not only in the UK but also in various locations in Europe. In 1866, he was sent to inspect the railway systems of France and Italy, in order to determine how best to transfer mail destined for India from northern France to the Italian port of Brindisi. On his recommendation the route was accepted. Later career In 1867, he investigated London's water supply following an outbreak of cholera, an investigation which involved emptying a reservoir of the East London Waterworks Company next to the river Lea, and tasting the contaminated water. His report helped confirm that cholera was water-borne rather than by the air. In 1868, he spent two periods of leave building the first railway in Greece from Athens to Piraeus. In 1871, he received promotion to Chief Inspector of Railways, and in 1874 he went to America to inspect the Erie for British investors. He was a member of the abortive Channel Tunnel Commission in 1875 to 1876. On retirement from the Railway Inspectorate, he became President of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1877 where he established a successful working relationship with Sir Joseph Hickson.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Sir Joseph Hickson He was also chairman of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company and Deputy Chairman of the Great Eastern Railway Company.[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/01/31/106773410.pdf New York Times Sir Henry W Tyler dead\\" 31 January 1908 He was a director of National Mutual Assurance and Globe Insurance Company, chairman of the Rhymney Iron Company, chairman of the Peruvian Bondholders Committee and chairman of the Peruvian Corporation.

A member of the Association of Polish Art Photographers, his pictures were published in a number of internationally renowned newspapers and magazines, among them Newsweek, Time, Der Spiegel and Forbes. In 1986 he received the World Press Photo prize for a portrait of J√°nos K√°d√°r. He is best known for his series of photographs documenting life behind the Iron Curtain, as well as the history of Solidarno≈õƒá. His picture of an Armoured Personnel Carrier standing in front of Warsaw's \\"Moscow\\" cinema screening \\"Apocalypse Now\\" became one of the icons of the Martial Law in Poland.  Biography  Kodak Starmite, Niedenthal's first camera Chris Niedenthal was born 1950 in London,http://www.photographie.com/?autid=108203 to a family of Polish World War II-era refugees. His father used to be a public prosecutor in Vilna until the war, after 1945 he was forced to settle in the United Kingdom, where he started working for the ministry of education. Niedenthal's mother had been working for the emmigree Polish Telegraphic Agency. He first visited Poland in 1963 and since then he was regularly visiting the country of his parents. He received his first photographic camera, the Kodak Starmite, at the age of 11. Soon after finishing school he joined the London College of Printing, where he graduated from a three-year photography course. In 1973 he settled in Poland and became a freelancer journalist and photographer for Newsweek. His first major photoreport featured illegal churches established against the will of the ruling communist party in the People's Republic of Poland. In 1978 Niedenthal was the first to document the town of Wadowice, the hometown of Karol Wojty≈Ça immediately after the latter had been elected pope John Paul II. He also documented the pope's first visit to Poland the following year. In 1980 Niedenthal, together with Michael Dobbs, were the first foreign journalists to enter the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard during the rise of the Solidarno≈õƒá movement. After the community leadership introduced martial law, Niedenthal was one of very few foreign photographers documenting the reality in Poland for western media. He managed to smuggle many of his pictures abroad, to be published in Germany's Der Spiegel or American Newsweek and Time. Among such pictures was one that became an icon of that part of Polish history, depicting a SKOT APC standing in front of a cinema in Warsaw, with a large banner advertising Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now in the background. His 1986 picture of Hungarian communist leader J√°nos K√°d√°r made it to the cover of the international edition of TIME magazine and was awarded with the World Press Photo prize for that year. In 1987 Niedenthal moved to Vienna to work for Time's Eastern European office, but returned to Poland soon afterwards. In 1998 he received Polish citizenship and continues to live in Poland.

It is among a string of narrow islands above Molesey Lock and due to its clubhouse and size -- the second-smallest named island on the Thames -- it has deep foundation pilings to raise the building more than 1 m above the water line. Location and access Benn's Island, the second-smallest public map-named island on the Thames, is close to the left bank of the River Thames at Hampton, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in England, on the reach above Molesey Lock, the second non-tidal reach of the river. The water between the island and the near bank is shallow and navigable with care to small vessels. The clubhouse is linked to Benn's Alley, a narrow slipway on the northern bank by a manually operated pedestrian chain ferry at the downstream end. Hampton Ferry connecting to Molesey operates to the east of the island using a separate set of steps or slipway and directly facing to St Mary's Church.Ordnance Survey map, courtesy of English Heritage Use In the 19th century the island was used by the then Thames Valley Sailing Club, transforming to the Middle Thames Yacht and motorboat club on Sunbury Lock Ait, whose then headquarters were a houseboat moored at Benn's Island and which was destroyed by fire in 1900. Since 1945 it has been leased by Hampton Sailing Club which also conducts some paddleboarding and shares the reach with two school watersports clubs and Molesey Boat Club.

A Democrat, she was first elected chairman in a special election on February 3, 2009. Bulova was reelected in 2011 and again on November 3, 2015. She retired at the end of her last term in January 2020. Early life One of four children of Lawrence King Schuster, Sr. and the former Mary Suzanne Knox, Sharon Schuster grew up in Pikesville, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore. In 1966, Schuster married scientist Richard T. Bulova and the couple moved to Fairfax County, where Richard worked at Fort Belvoir. After living in Woodbridge for a short time, in 1971, they moved back to Fairfax County, buying a house in the Kings Park West neighborhood of Fairfax. Fairfax City 4th of July parade. Bulova was elected vice president of the Kings Park West Civic Association, then became president when the existing president moved to Korea. In 1984, Annandale District Supervisor Audrey Moore hired Bulova. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Budget Public Hearing Political career In 1987, Bulova was working as a legislative aide to Annandale District Supervisor Audrey Moore when Moore decided to challenge Republican Jack Herrity for the Chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. Moore encouraged Bulova to replace her on the Board; Bulova declared her candidacy in April 1987. Bulova, a Democrat, defeated Republican D. Patrick Mullins for the Annandale District seat in the November 1987 election, and was sworn in the following January. In 1988, Bulova became a member of the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission. In her first term as supervisor, Bulova focused on transportation, environmental and educational issues. One of her major projects, which she had begun working on while still on Audrey Moore's staff, was the Virginia Railway Express commuter rail service. Bulova announced her run for a second term as supervisor in February 1991. Though Democratic chair Audrey Moore was deeply unpopular, and despite the Republican strategy of tying all the board's Democrats to deeply unpopular chair Audrey Moore, Bulova won reelection as supervisor from the renamed Braddock District in November 1991, defeating Paul E. Jenkins. In her 1995 run, Bulova handily defeated the Republican candidate, restaurant owner Paul A. Romano, III. Bulova was unopposed for her runs as Braddock District Supervisor in 1999 and 2003. She defeated Carey C. Campbell in the 2007 election for Braddock District supervisor with over 80% of the vote. The election of Gerry Connolly as congressman from Virginia's 11th congressional district in November 2008 necessitated a special election to fill the Chairman's seat on the Board of Supervisors. In the February 3, 2009 special election, Bulova defeated her challengers, Republican Springfield District Supervisor Pat S. Herrity, as well as Independent Green Carey C. Campbell and independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. On November 3, 2015, Bulova was reelected as chairman of the Board of Supervisors, defeating Republican Arthur G. Purves and Independent Green Glenda Gail Parker. In November 2011, Bulova received the Tower of Dulles award from the Committee for Dulles for her work to bring Metrorail to Dulles International Airport. Community efforts In 2011, Bulova initiated a Private Sector Energy Task Force consisting of corporate, institutional, and community leaders. The task force was charged with defining a strategy to position Fairfax County as a leader in the areas of energy efficiency, sustainability, and green technology.\\"Fairfax Effort to Tackle Energy Issues Wins Applaud from Neighbor\\" The Business Roundtable Discussion Group was put together by Bulova to identify strategies for accelerating economic recovery in Fairfax County. In addition, the group is tasked with finding new economic development opportunities that include energy efficiency, conservation, and affordable housing strategies. Bulova put together a task force for the Fairfax County Asian American History Project. In May 2010, this task force produced a book and a website which captures the history of Asian-Americans in Fairfax County. Celebrating Fairfax County's 275th Anniversary Bulova founded the Faith Communities in Action.

The population was 4,035 at the 2010 census. Madawaska is opposite Edmundston, Madawaska County in New Brunswick, Canada, to which it is connected by the Edmundston- Madawaska Bridge over the Saint John River. The majority of its residents speak French; 83.4% of the population speak French at home. Home of a large annual Acadian festival, Madawaska is the northernmost town in New England. History During the early colonial period, Madawaska was a meeting place and hunting/fishing area for the Maliseet (Wolastoqiyik) nation. Later, it was at the center of the bloodless Aroostook War. The final border between the two countries was established with the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, which gave Maine most of the disputed area, and gave the British a militarily vital connection between the province of Quebec and the province of New Brunswick. Many families were left divided after the settlement.Robert Remini, Daniel Webster (1997) 535-64 Economy Madawaska is a rural town whose economy centers on the Saint John River paper industry. The river historically provided water power for the mills and was the route of log drives bringing pulpwood from upstream forests. The river still provides the water supply for paper manufacture, but environmental concerns encourage pulpwood delivery by highway and rail. Canadian corporation Twin Rivers (originally Fraser Papers) has a large facility located in Madawaska which processes the pulp produced by the mill's other plant in Edmundston. The pulp is shipped across the border through a mile-long high pressure pipeline running between both facilities, and is made into paper in Madawaska. The Madawaska mill specializes in fine- grade papers. The town's economy is highly dependent upon cross-border trade, to the extent that Madawaska and its larger sister city of Edmundston are considered by residents under many aspects, a single economic entity. Madawaska is also home to the St. John Valley Times, a popular weekly newspaper circulated across Aroostook County. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

It is a cycloalkane and an isomer of the simplest diamondoid, adamantane, and like adamantane, is not very volatile. Twistane was named for the way its rings are permanently forced into the cyclohexane conformation known as the \\"twist-boat\\". The compound was first reported by Whitlock in 1962. Synthesis Twistane has been synthesized in a variety of ways. The original 1962 method was based on a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework. A 1967 publication concerned an intramolecular aldol condensation of a cis- decalin diketone. It is formed when basketane is hydrogenated. Symmetry The only symmetry operation in twistane is rotation, and there exist three 2-fold axes as shown in the left picture. Thus the point group of twistane is D2. Although twistane has four stereocenters, it only exists as two enantiomers. This is because it is symmetric along its C2 axis.

He spent most of his professional career in Portugal, most notably at Benfica. Club career Born in Damba, U√≠ge Province, Vata started his football career at Progresso Associa√ß√£o do Sambizanga. After a good run in Portugal with Varzim SC, he caught the eye of Primeira Liga club S.L. Benfica, signing with them for 1988‚Äì89 and being crowned the season's top scorer in his first year. In the following campaign's European Cup campaign, Vata achieved his most (in)famous moment: after the 1‚Äì2 defeat at Olympique de Marseille in the semifinals, he scored from a left-side corner kick, putting the ball in the net with his right arm as Benfica won on the away goals rule with that single goal. After two more seasons in Portugal, with C.F. Estrela da Amadora and S.C.U. Torreense, 38-year-old Vata retired in 1999 after spells with Malta's Floriana Football Club and Gelora Dewata and Persija Jakarta (Indonesia, where he also would act as player-coach). In 1993‚Äì94 he also had a brief go at Futsal, in the United States. As a full-time manager, Vata worked with Guntur Bali, winning the league in his only season and also coaching in that country Mitra Kukar F.C. and Kalimantan (in 2004‚Äì05). He also worked at the International School in Bali in 2000 and at the European Football Institute in Australia, as a high-performance coach of both the senior and reserve teams.

Family background  G. P. Solomos was born in Detroit in 1925, the youngest of five children of Greek-born Christian parents. The Solomos family were descendants of tobacco tycoon Count Nicolas Solomonee from Venice. They were olive oil producers who settled in Greece before the end of the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1829). They were relatives of the Greek poet Dionysios Solomos who had lived on the Greek island Zante (Zakynthos) most of his adult life; his most famous poem \\"Hymn to Liberty\\" is the Greek National Anthem. His father had left Sparta because of a family tragedy when he was still a teenager. Having been educated in the English language he decided to make his way to the USA. His mother ‚Äì also from Sparta ‚Äì was taken to the States by her two older brothers for similar tragic reasons as his father. His parents were introduced on landing in New York about 1910, and decided to marry and stay in the United States for a while. George Solomos published and wrote under the name Themistocles Hoetis, the surname of his mother's family, from 1948 to 1958, after being advised by some relatives that his views could attract trouble for his family.  Early life  George was born and raised in Detroit; an American city which became known as Motor City ‚Äì the center of the US car industry ‚Äì as well as a wellspring of much great popular music; from soul to heavy metal and techno. Prior to Motown, jazz had moved from up from the clubs of Chicago to Detroit in the 1920s, and George spent much of his teenage years in jazz clubs. His father ran a large Mediterranean delicatessen and general food store on Vermont and Henry Street, right near to Michigan Avenue. George Solomos joined the USAF at the age of 17 after changing his birth certificate with his father's permission. After a short period of training, he was almost immediately shipped to Britain, where he became a radio operator in an American B-17 Flying Fortress bomber based in an airfield in East Anglia. After his plane was shot down on his eleventh bombing mission to Germany; the crew bailed out of the burning bomber and George ended up landing tangled in the branches of an apple tree in North East France, near to the Belgian / Dutch border. He was rescued by a French grandmother and her granddaughter. After a night in the farmhouse he was passed to the French Resistance. He was taken on a journey of over 200 miles to a little village north of Paris called Evereux. He stayed in the village with the caretaker of Ch√¢teau de Beaufresne, which had belonged to the famous impressionist painter, Mary Cassatt. The chateau was being used as a residence for German officers. At this point he was given a new ‚Äì fake ‚Äì ID card with a swastika stamp. George Solomos was then passed to other members of the Resistance who helped the young airman cross Occupied France and eventually enter Spain, from where he was sent to Gibraltar, and then back to his airbase near Ipswich.  Later life  From 1948 to 1958 George Solomos used the pen-name Themistocles Hoetis. A relative had warned him that he could bring shame to the family with his outspoken political views, which had developed in response to both the war and the de-programming that he received back in the United States ‚Äì a standard \\"treatment\\" for all servicemen who had been in close contact with Communists. Under this name he and Albert Beneviste published and edited a magazine called ZERO: A Review of Literature and Art. The first issue contained the famous attack on Richard Wright by James Baldwin, followed by a short story by Wright. Among the prominent writers featured in the magazine were Samuel Beckett, Paul Bowles, Christopher Isherwood, Kenneth Patchen, and Thomas Mann's eldest son, Klaus Mann. Zero Press from 1956 also published novels and a collection of stories by Gore Vidal. The magazine Zero ran from 1949 to 1956. Its first two issues were published in Paris in 1949, the rest in Tangiers, Mexico City and in New York. A first anthology of Zero was published in 1956, another without his involvement in 1974 by The New York Times. An additional number was issued in Philadelphia in 1980. It reported on the very violent action taken by the Philadelphia Police Department against the black revolutionary commune MOVE. He married Gidske Anderson in London in 1952. She had been with the wartime resistance in Norway. She met Solomos in Paris after the War. They both shared a love of jazz and, as a neighbor, she had asked to borrow some of his records. She was then working for the Norwegian newspaper Arbeiderbladet and later became deputy chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. She died in 1993.New York Times (March 27, 1949): Americans in Paris by Joseph A. Barry.Albert Beneviste, later Asa Benveniste, started the Trigram Press in London in 1965, which published many well-known British and some American poets.When Gidske Anderson and James Baldwin were on their way to Tangier to meet Solomos, Baldwin became ill in Marseille and was nursed back to health by Gidske. Having published his novel The Man Who Went Away in 1952, George received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1953 to live and write in Mexico City, where he completed his still unpublished book Thermopylae, a novel about war and the ideals of ancient Sparta. In 1958 at Detroit Town Hall George legally changed the name he had used for the last ten years while publishing ZERO ‚Äì Themistocles Hoetis ‚Äì back to his birth name of George Paul Solomos. From 1958 to 1960, George was asked by Dr. Bascilius (Head of Humanities) at Wayne State University, where he had completed a one-year course after the war ended in 1945 ‚Äì which was his entitlement as a US veteran ‚Äì to propose and edit work for publication by the Wayne State University Press (WSU Press). The first book he designed for the WSU Press was The Poems of William Blake, which won the award of Best Poetry Anthology of the year 1958 from the Poetry Society of America. The next year, 1959, he had prepared a version of the anti-nuclear tract by Bertrand Russell, Common Sense and Nuclear Warfare which the WSU Press had already proofed and printed. It was withdrawn under threat from large industrial sponsors who threatened to withhold funding. Solomos left the United States soon after this and returned to Europe.  Films  George made two films in Italy (1961‚Äì63). The first that he made was a 20-minute film called Echo in the Village, which was shot on two 35mm cameras over 5 days in a small village called Cappadocia. It is in black and white and stars the town's inhabitants. It is based on his original story about a grandfather helping a boy learn English so that he can leave the village and go to America. George Solomos was re-united with many of the people who had featured in the film, including the boy who had played the young shepherd, when he returned to Cappadocia in 2002, on the fortieth anniversary of the film. A public screening was arranged in the village and a programme about the event was broadcast on the State TV channel. The second film is called Natika, and stars John Drew Barrymore, who was at the time living in Rome; and a young Welsh woman called Maureen Gavin for whom this was to be her only major film appearance. It was made on a larger budget than Echo in the Village, and was written and directed by George Solomos, as well as using the same personnel as his previous film. The film concerns a destructive romance between a young harpist studying in Rome, and a louche playboy and heir to Europe's wealthy corporate and governing class, played by J. D. Barrymore. The film was largely financed by a rich young American, Gray Frederickson, who was based in Tehran tending his Oklahoma father's oil wells but was attracted to Rome to break into the movie business. After taking the film to be re-edited before its completion, Fredrikson presented it at various film festivals as his production debut and went on to become a major Hollywood producer (e.g. Apocalypse Now). George was also a mentor to the young George Moorse, who was one of the directors of radical German cinema in the 1960s. Moorse's first film In Side Out (1964) ‚Äì with playwright Tom Stoppard in the cast ‚Äì was made with G√©rard Vandenberg, the cinematographer who worked on George Solomos' two films.  Travels and further projects  Tangier and Morocco George was a regular visitor to Morocco, where his friends Paul Bowles and Jane Bowles had lived for many years. He had first gone there in 1950 with Irving Thalberg, Jr., the son of the famous film producer of the same name, who later became a professor of philosophy. An article in the fashion magazine Flair, which was aimed at the New York literati, published with a transparent cover by the Cond√© Nast Publications heiress Fleur Cowles described George as: > an apprentice Yankee Balzac ‚Äì and a be-bop hipster perched on a cliff > outside Tangier celebrating the virtues of hashish... ‚Äì which was based on testimony of Gore Vidal who had met him on a visit to Morocco. After George returned to Madrid, he took the first Orient Express train to run through Greece to Istanbul since the end of WWII. He then went from Salonika to Athens and on to Sparta to visit his family home, through a country ravaged by war. London George Solomos then moved to what is now known as Swinging London in the 1960s, and was soon involved in its bohemian underground. He published David Chapman, a young poet who was briefly incarcerated in an Insane asylum because of his heroin addiction, and wrote a powerful poem about his experiences which was called Withdrawal. A book, which also contained pictures by Chapman, was published by George Solomos in 1964 with help from philanthropist and wealthy heir, Jonathan Bryan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne ‚Äì a Conservative Party (UK) MP at the time ‚Äì who paid for a full page advert in the Conservative Monday Club publication, along with a voucher entitling members to a reduced-price copy. Guinness had the reputation of someone whose political instincts would now be recognised as libertarian conservatism. A reading by David Chapman was held that year in the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. George also commissioned a soundtrack from the experimental jazz combo Spontaneous Music Ensemble. George Solomos brought a print of his short film Echo in the Village to the UK in the early 1960s and was invited onto the BBC television show Late Night Line Up (1964‚Äì72), where he was interviewed by Joan Bakewell. His appearance followed Bakewell's interview that same evening with American theatre and film director Joseph Losey. His next major publishing venture was in 1968, when he produced a film magazine called FIBA, which won the prize for the Best Film Publication at the Venice Film Festival (La Biennale di Venezia) that year. It was financed largely by the young Japanese Fluxus artist Yoko Ono. She later introduced him to her partner, John Lennon of The Beatles, and they asked him to arrange US showings of some films they had made, including Smile and Bottoms. George Solomos arranged for them to be premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1970, and took the movies on a series of screenings around the USA. Ireland From 1970 to 1972 George was the Film correspondent for The Irish Times, but was asked to leave Ireland by the Irish government after commenting unfavourably on the influence of the Roman Catholic Church on Irish culture. George had also infuriated the Irish government for arranging the free distribution of The Little Red Schoolbook, which was being given away free in England at the time by the National Union of School Students. He was seen onto a ferry to Britain by Charles Haughey, who later wrote to him and offered to let him return. He returned to London, where he managed to sell a film outline to Ringo Starr that would be a potential vehicle for mutual friend (and star of the 1959 film Shadows directed by John Cassavetes ), actor Ben Carruthers. This financed a trip to Sparta in Greece, homeland of the Solomos family, where he visited his family's village. USA In 1974 George Solomos moved to Philadelphia and lived in a house opposite the MOVE commune when it was notoriously bombed from a police helicopter, a tragedy that killed six adult residents and five children. George Solomos published one last copy of ZERO in the early 1980s, which was dedicated to John Africa and the members of MOVE, many of whom were still in prison in the United States in 2009. After moving to the first apartment block in the United States built with its own community studio and cable TV facility George Solomos started a reality TV series featuring some of the block's residents ‚Äì which was later credited with being the inspiration for the NBC series The Golden Girls. He also arranged for a filmed interview with Mumia Abu-Jamal on death row in Philadelphia ‚Äì the last instance of such an interview, since the law was changed afterwards to prevent any similar media attention. The resulting film is on YouTube in three parts.\\"fibafilmbank\\" @ YouTube. Europe In 1986 George returned to France to find the villagers who had helped him escape from the Nazis in Occupied France. The International Herald Tribune managed to track down the son of the granddaughter who had initially rescued him from the apple tree and hidden him in the cellar. Since 1999 George has been publishing the on-line version of his film and culture magazine fiba. In 1999 he was a guest at the Havana Film Festival, where he showed the Mumia Abu-Jamal documentary and a short film featuring Alice Walker, as well as being interviewed by Cuban television. Death George Solomos died at home in Catford, SE London on November 8, 2010. His second book is currently being translated into Spanish for publication in the next year. It is called Villa Alba, and is a novel based on some time he spent in Franco's Spain in the 1950s.

Three of them came into service during the Civil War after joining the rebel side.  Design and construction  The minelayers were commissioned by the Government of the Republic to SECN shipyards at Ferrol in 1935, a year before the start of the Spanish Civil War. The construction had been approved by the Cortes on 27 March 1934, after a proposal from the minister of the navy Juan Jos√© Rocha Garc√≠a. The warships of the class were designed to protect the Balearic islands in the event of a war between France and Italy.

On 17 October 1938, she seized the Soviet cargo ship Katayama, of 3,200 tons. She also played a secondary role in the capture of the Greek merchant Victoria by the auxiliary cruiser Mar Cant√°brico and the British Stangrove by the gunboat Dato, in the final months of the civil war. All these freighters joined the Spanish merchant fleet at the end of the conflict.Moreno de Albor√°n y de Reyna, Fernando: La guerra silenciosa y silenciada: Historia de la campa√±a naval durante la guerra de 1936-39. Madrid, 1998, v. 4, part 2. Perhaps the most famous action of Vulcano is the chase and capture of the Republican off Gibraltar, in the course of a battle fought as close as between the ships involved. Jos√© Luis Diez eventually became stranded in Catalan Bay, in the territory of Gibraltar, the last day of 1938. The destroyer was turned over to Franco's government after its recognition by Britain as the legitimate authority in Spain.The Jos√© Luis Diez issue , a lecture by Dennis D. Beiso, Gibraltar, 2002 She was the leading unit of an aborted landing at Cartagena on 7 March 1939, after the withdrawal of the Republican fleet from its bases and its internment at Bizerte. The operation was mounted on the belief that anti- communist Republicans had taken over the port once the Government navy fled. However, loyalist forces retook control of the coastal batteries around the harbour. All the ships received the order of aborting the operation, but two transports, and Castillo Pe√±afiel, deprived of radio, continued toward Cartagena undeterred. They were the former Soviet steamers Postishev and Smidovich, of 3,545 and 2,485 tons respectively, which had been seized by the Nationalists at high seas.Gonz√°lez Etchegaray, Rafael : La Marina Mercante y el Trafico Maritimo en la Guerra Civil. Editorial San Martin, Madrid, 1977, Appendix II. Castillo de Olite was sunk by a battery close to the docks, with a loss of life of almost 1,500. Meanwhile, Castillo Pe√±afiel had a narrow escape, harassed by Republican aircraft. In a letter to General Franco, Admiral Francisco Moreno put the blame on Vulcanos commander for his failure to prevent the departure of the freighters, as ordered by Moreno himself. Vulcano apparently gave a green light to the transports after receiving contradicting orders from the high command to proceed.De la Cierva, Ricardo: La victoria y el caos: a los sesenta a√±os del 1 de abril de 1939. F√©nix, 1999, pp. 512-518. Along with her sister ships, Vulcano landed two infantry battalions at Alicante on 31 March, the day before the official end of hostilities.  Marte  Marte was the last minelayer of the class to be commissioned before the end of the civil war. Neptuno, the last of the batch, was not completed until November 1939, seven months after the war was over. Marte was released to the Nationalist navy on 11 November 1938. The minelayer departed from El Ferrol in December 1938 to take part in the chase of the Republican destroyer Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, which had taken shelter in Gibraltar. Given the inexperience of her crew, Marte didn't play any major role in the neutralization of the Republican warship. Later, in January 1939, while based at the port of Palma, Marte participated in gunnery trials off Majorca and in blockade activities along the Catalan coast and the Gulf of Lion. In February, she relieved her sister J√∫piter from her blockade duties off Catalonia, and on 21 February she attended a naval parade at Salou. On 7 March 1939, during the ill-fated landing on Cartagena, Marte loaded troops and cargo at Castellon before the operation was cancelled. Along with her sisters, she patrolled the Republican waters off Alicante in the waning days of the war. Marte took part in one of the last international maritime incidents of the war on 19 March 1939, when she prevented the British steamer Stanbrook from entering Alicante. The ship, chartered by the Republican government, went back to Oran, Algeria.Arias, Fernando: La Valencia de los a√±os 30. Entre el paraiso y el infierno. Carena Editors, S.l., 1999, page 235. The Stanbrook eventually reached the Spanish port on 27 March,Republicanos. De Alicante hacia √Åfrica.1939 after the Nationalist side displayed some indulgency toward the evacuation of refugees in return for the British recognition of Franco's legitimacy.\\"The British government assumed that Franco would overlook the activities of the occasional merchant ship.\\" Graham, Helen: The Spanish Republic at war, 1936-1939. Cambridge University Press, 2002, page 422. Two days later, Stanbrook left Alicante bound for Oran, crowded with at least 2,000 people, one of the last ships to either enter or flee Republican Spain. Her Welsh skipper, Captain Archibald Dickson, later killed during the sinking of his ship in World War II, is today remembered as a hero in Alicante.Alicante recuerda al gal√©s que salv√≥ a miles de republicanos =Refurbishment= Of the four vessels, only J√∫piter and Vulcano took part in a modernization program after the agreements between Spain and the United States in the 1950s, and were reclassified as frigates. The modernization was held in Cartagena from 1958 to 1961. The antisubmarine and antiaircraft weapons were updated by adding a squid multiple mortar and Bofors 40 mm guns. The units were also fitted with radar. Both ships joined the frigate squadron along with those units of the first Pizarro class. J√∫piter was written off the Navy list on 23 November 1974, and Vulcano was used as a store ship from 12 March 1977 until her final decommissioning on 30 April 1978, this being the last warship to be removed from service of those who participated in the Civil War.Asamblea de Capitanes de Yate:La armada espa√±ola.

Born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Soriano moved to Seattle with his family when he was five. He played baseball at Franklin High School in Seattle; among his teammates on the Quakers were Fred Hutchinson and newspaper columnist Emmett Watson. Prior to owning the Pilots, Soriano served as president of both the Pacific Coast League and the Western International League. Soriano also pitched in the minor leagues for several years before becoming the owner and player-manager of the Yakima Bears. When Soriano won the Pilots expansion franchise in late 1967, he didn't have enough money to pay the franchise fee. In what proved to be a harbinger of things to come, he had to ask for help from former Cleveland Indians owner Bill Daley ‚Äî who, ironically, had nearly moved the Indians to Seattle earlier in the 1960s. In return, Soriano sold Daley a 47 percent stake in the team, making him the largest shareholder. Soriano, however, retained the team presidency. Largely due to being badly undercapitalized, Soriano was nearly out of money by the end of the 1969 season. Almost as soon as the season ended, it was apparent that Soriano wouldn't be able to hold out before moving to a new stadium. It was also apparent that the timetable for a new park would have to be significantly advanced, as the Pilots' temporary home, Sick's Stadium, was completely inadequate even for temporary use. Soriano put the Pilots on the market, but no credible offers surfaced from Seattle interests. Out of desperation, Soriano cut a deal to sell the franchise to a Milwaukee-based group led by Bud Selig. However, legal action dragged out throughout the 1969‚Äì1970 offseason. Ultimately, Soriano took the team into bankruptcy, clearing the way for Selig to take control and move the Pilots to Milwaukee as the Milwaukee Brewers. After the move to Milwaukee was finalized in late March, Soriano and his brother Max were hung in effigy in Seattle. After seven summers without major league baseball in Seattle, the expansion Mariners began play in 1977.

The January 4, 1641 eruption that enveloped most of Mindanao in darkness was falsely attributed to Balut Volcano, as well as other volcanoes in the Philippines. Later studies proved that the eruption came from Mount Parker, NW of Balut Island. Geology Rock type on the volcano is predominantly basalt and andesite. Balut is part of the Central Mindanao Arc, an area of frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity. All volcanoes in the Philippines are part of the Pacific ring of fire. Like most volcanoes in southern Philippines, Balut Volcano is little studied scientifically. Astronomy Being among the southernmost islands in the Philippines, it is possible at this location to see both the North Star and the Magellanic Clouds at the same time. Polaris is very low in the northern sky at about 5¬∞ altitude (the length of your thumb with an outstretched arm). The Southern Cross is also visible and its vertical bar points almost directly at the South Cardinal Point. Being near the equator, the sun is often very high in the sky. At a latitude of 5¬∞ 24', the sun passes directly overhead at noon time about April 3 and September 8 of each year, causing zero-length shadows. This phenomenon is not possible in high-latitude areas. Astronomers from PAGASA set up on the island to observe the December 26, 2019 Annular Solar Eclipse. Balut Island, Sarangani Island, and Olanivan Island are the only places in the Philippines where the annularity was visible. Other parts of the Philippines only experienced a partial solar eclipse. The eclipse had a magnitude of 97.2% in Balut Island, 97.1% in Sarangani Island, and 96.8% in Olanivan Island. According to their local folklore, eclipses are caused by a dragon named Bakunawa devouring the sun.

The term is from the Greek prefix makro- meaning \\"large\\" and from Greek œÉœÑœåŒºŒ±, \\"mouth\\".œÉœÑœåŒºŒ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Macrostomia is characterized as a physical abnormality that causes clefts to form on the face of affected individuals. These clefts can form on either or both sides of the face, but they are most commonly seen on the right cheek and have a higher rate of occurrence in males. Macrostomia is very irregular and on average occurs only once in every 150,000 to 300,000 live births. It's unusual for macrostomia to occur on its own and it is included as a symptom for many diseases including craniofacial microsomia. The clefts result from improper development and fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes. The clefts cause problems with facial muscle development. The origin of macrostomia is not yet fully understood it could have multiple causes.  Phenotypic variations  There are 4 distinct variations of macrostomia. Classifications are a complete lateral facial cleft, simple macrostomia, macrostomia with diastasis of the facial musculature, and isolated facial musculature diastasis. Each has a different physical appearance with varying levels of severity. The cleft associated with macrostomia is associated with improper or failed fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes during embryonic development. This can lead to a variety of abnormalities involving skin, subcutaneous tissue, facial muscles, and the mucous membrane. The severity of each abnormality can vary from minor to severe. Environmental contaminants may play a role in causing macrostomia. Many affected individuals were found in Lagos, an industrial area of Nigeria, where water supplies are known to be contaminated by improper disposal of industrial and domestic waste. = Complete lateral facial cleft = The facial cleft runs from the corner of the mouth towards the bottom of the ear. The outside of the ear on the affected side of the face appears as normal and a region of soft tissue connects the cleft to the right lateral posterior hard palate. Internally there is no soft palate. = Simple macrostomia = This version of macrostomia is less severe because it does not affect the facial muscles and is not associated with any soft tissue or bone deformities. A small cleft(s) extends from the mouth and can be repaired surgically. = Diastasis of the Facial Musculature = Clefts in this variant are slightly more severe than the ones seen in simple macrostomia. It also does not have bone deformities, but it does include minor soft tissue deformities. The defining feature is muscle diastasis which is separation of the masseter. This phenotype can also be partially corrected with surgery. = Isolated Facial Musculature Diastasis = The facial cleft in this case results in a more severe muscle separation even though there is not a true open cleft. Bones in the region remain unaffected and the phenotype appears as an indentation of the cheek rather than an open cleft. The external ear in this phenotype can also be deformed.  Mechanism  Likely due to the complexity of macrostomia, many theories have been provided over time in an attempt to define its origin. There is no definitive mechanism to explain its development but it is likely that there are interactions between genes and the environment resulting in improper development of the first and sometimes second brachial arch. = Genetic = Macrostomia can be partially classified as a heritable autosomal dominant disease. The responsible mutation is found on the short arm of chromosome 1 in locations 32-34 (1p32-1p34). The mutation is heterozygous meaning that it only occurs in one allele. A single base substitution in the 11th coding region of the gene PTCH2 changes an adenine to guanine. This results in a valine being incorporated instead of an isoleucine at the 147th position during translation of the resulting transmembrane protein (Val147Ile). The transmembrane protein encoded by PTCH2 is 1204 amino acids long and is involved with inhibiting the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway that is involved with development. PTCH2 inhibits the smooth frizzled class receptor (SMO) which when active is responsible for increasing transcription rates of many genes involved with development and differentiation. PTCH2 (Val147Ile) is a loss of function mutation which results in a lack of control of cell growth during development and links it to macrostomia.

It details a hypothesis about the societal effect of the Internet, and how this will affect production and consumption of popular culture to a \\"remix culture\\".  Summary  In Remix, Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor and a respected voice in what he deems the \\"copyright wars\\", describes the disjuncture between the availability and relative simplicity of remix technologies and copyright law. Lessig insists that copyright law as it stands now is antiquated for digital media since every \\"time you use a creative work in a digital context, the technology is making a copy\\".Lessig, Lawrence. 2008. Remix: making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy. New York: Penguin Press. p. 71 Thus, amateur use and appropriation of digital technology is under unprecedented control that previously extended only to professional use. Lessig insists that knowledge and manipulation of multi-media technologies is the current generation's form of \\"literacy\\"- what reading and writing was to the previous. It is the vernacular of today. The children growing up in a world where these technologies permeate their daily life are unable to comprehend why \\"remixing\\" is illegal. Lessig insists that amateur appropriation in the digital age cannot be stopped but only 'criminalized'. Thus most corrosive outcome of this tension is that generations of children are growing up doing what they know is \\"illegal\\" and that notion has societal implications that extend far beyond copyright wars. The book is now available as a free download under one of the Creative Commons' licenses (CC BY-NC 3.0Remix on remix.lessig.orgRemix on scribd.com).  Read-only culture vs. read/write culture  Lessig outlines two cultures - the read-only culture (RO) and the read/write culture (RW). The RO culture is the culture we consume more or less passively. The information or product is provided to us by a 'professional' source, the content industry, that possesses an authority on that particular product/information. Analog technologies inherently supported RO culture's business model of production and distribution and limited the role of the consumer to just that, 'consuming'. Digital technology, however, does not have the 'natural' constraints of the analog that preceded it. \\"What before was both impossible and illegal is now just illegal\\"(38). Steve Jobs was the first to see potential in this new market made possible by digital technology. RO culture had to be recoded in order to compete with the \\"free\\" distribution made possible by the Internet. iTunes Music store was proof of this. While it provided digital music it was protected by a Digital Rights Management (DRM) code from re-distribution. Lessig uses this key example to show that it is possible to achieve a business model which balances access and control and is equally attractive to both the consumers and the creators. In addition, digital technologies have changed the way we think about 'access'. Today, most of us would never structure our day around a particular program because we know that it is most likely available online - even if it is not necessarily free of charge. Lessig insists, using Amazon as his premiere example, that the future of entertainment and advertising lies in accumulating information about a consumer and tailoring the product to their preferences. As opposed to RO culture, Read/Write culture has a reciprocal relationship between the producer and the consumer. Taking works, such as songs, and appropriating them in private circles is exemplary of RW culture, which was considered to be the 'popular' culture before the advent of reproduction technologies. The technologies and copyright laws that soon followed, however, changed the dynamics of popular culture. As it became professionalized people were taught to defer production to the professionals. Lessig posits that digital technologies provide the tools for reviving RW culture and democratizing production. He uses blogs to explain the three layers of this democratization. Blogs have redefined our relationship to the content industry as they allowed access to non-professional content. The 'comments' feature that soon followed provided a space for readers to have a dialogue with the amateur contributors. 'Tagging' of the blogs by users based on the content provided the necessary layer for users to filter the sea of content according to their interest. The third layer added bots that analyzed the relationship between various websites by counting the clicks between them and, thus, organizing a database of preferences. The three layers working together established an \\"ecosystem of reputation\\"(61) that served to guide users through the blogosphere. Lessig uses the blog model to demonstrate a wider conclusion - while there is no doubt many amateur online publications cannot compete with the validity of professional sources, the democratization of digital RW culture and the 'ecosystem of reputation' provides a space for many talented voices to be heard that was not available in the pre-digital RO model. Hybrid Economies There are three economies that Lessig introduced in his book. The first is the commercial economy. Commercial Economies at their very center value money the most and build value around the monetary. Second to this is the sharing economy which completely ignores money as an item of value and instead focuses on valuing things that are not monetary. But settled in between the two is a third, the hybrid economy. He asserts that the hybrid economy will be the dominant force with the rise of the web, and in order for it thrive the two economies from which it borrows from must be preserved. Conceptually the monetizing nature from the commercial, and the 'lending' quality of the sharing economy are necessary to ensure that the hybrid doesn't lose sight of economic gain or doesn't lose the willingness to obtain economic resources. The Internet and Commons The internet is essentially the hub for this type of economy. With more people utilizing it as a platform for sharing and monetizing, the internet's primary function is split in two. In order for people to 'Remix' they need the internet for its open and free design. Remix, according to Lessig, is not solely digital, but also relates to the act of reading and applying texts to their personal life. Culturally, critically taking in what is going on (the original content) and developing an opinion that can be shared and given transformed meaning, is also considered remixing. Most of the debate in Remix is in regard to ownership. Due to the fact that remixing is limitless, it becomes difficult to end. Every mix becomes a resource for another new mix and expands to others even if they are never seen. When it comes to the internet, ownership has become a murky subject. Companies who originated a piece of work are owners of that product, but only if it is copyrighted and protected legally. That being said, people without access to these legalities are unprotected and liable to get their ideas and content stolen. This is where the commons becomes prevalent. He defines the commons as resources that are available for everyone equally in a certain group. The internet was invented for flexible accessibility and thus facilitates innovation. This is Lessig's philosophy, however the issue comes with a price tag. The fight to define who owns a creative work of art if it contains other works not owned by the party is what Lessig says is \\"killing creativity\\". Although people have become used to this, he argues that it is for this reason that he claims that it is an attempt at \\"counterrevolution\\". Free Software Notably Richard Stallman is vocal about his stance on the positive repercussions of utilizing free software, namely Linux. Essentially both Stallman and Lessig are on the same page. When it comes to 'hybrid' economies, Linux fits the description with its selling point being \\"benefits\\", instead of \\"features\\". This on its own has no standing for 'justice' but rather the profitability of such a software. Remixing is this software's very nature. The appeal is to \\"sell\\" the benefits of its use. People no longer have to wait for a company to fix bugs, or other issues with the software and instead they can collaborate and ultimately do it themselves. This can be done with other software, but the downside is that legally with paid proprietary software there are repercussions to prevent, the software from being \\"remixed\\" and sold as an alternative \\"original\\"'.  The Prevalence of YouTube  YouTube's growing issue in copyright claims With the internet comes what Lessig described as community spaces, with site YouTube up for major debate for its ability to both provide original content and exist as an open bank for content to Remix. The website provides users a domain to not only consume, but to make creative content. Creativity in this sense, relates to the combining of elements or materials with an individuals original ideas to create a unique product. Lessig has had his own fight with the platform when his Lecture got taken down in 2013 on grounds of violating Copyright laws due to a song from the band Phoenix being used in part of the presentation. However, due to the non-commercialized and transformed nature of his usage, the video should have fallen under Fair use. This issue is an example of exactly what he is fighting for. In addition to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, YouTube also allows the claimant to place advertisements on the video. This is done as retribution for using or allowing copyrighted media in the video, and allows the user to keep the video up without having to deal with legalities. The website is taking the emphasis off of the creation, and placing it on the monetary value that it holds. Lessig argues that these issues should be separated when it comes to amateur non commercialized content. With growing frequency, YouTube has begun copyright striking, and taking down videos that appear to have claimed content in them in any way. Without the claim in question, to be the main feature in the video, it can merely be a song playing in the background that can take a user's work off the web. While original content featuring sole a user's own ideas and content does exist, this is not the focus of Remixing, or Lessig's point. It is not solely creating new and unique ideas with novelty resources, but instead pulling from multiple sources to give way to new products. To that Lessig's rebuttal is that the work made on such platforms should be free of legal ownership aside from its originator. These new products leverage the references in their original work in order to build a new and different meaning; which has no implications of being 'better' or 'worse' than its origin.  The remix  Lessig argues that today digital culture permeates our lifestyle to such extent - an average teenager will spend an hour per weekend day using the computer for leisure and only 7 minutes reading - that \\"it is no surprise that these other forms of 'creating' are becoming an increasingly dominant form of 'writing'\\"(69). Previous generations used textual quotes to build on writings before them. Today, this process of quoting or collage is manifest through digital media. The remix utilizes the (multi-media) language through which the current generations communicate. They quote content from various sources to create something \\"new\\". Thus, the remix provides a commentary on the sounds and images it utilizes the same way a critical essay provides commentary on the texts it quotes. One of Lessig's favorite remix examples is the \\"Bush and Blair Love Song\\" which remixes images of President Bush and Tony Blair to make it appear as if they are lip-synching Lionel Richie's \\"Endless Love\\". \\"The message couldn't be more powerful: an emasculated Britain, as captured in the puppy love of its leader for Bush\\" (74). This remix in Lessig's eyes is exemplary of the power this type of expression holds - to not tell but show. Using preexisting images is vital to the art form because the production of meaning draws heavily on cultural reference an image or sound brings with it. > Their meaning comes not from the content of what they say; it comes from the > reference, which is expressible only if it is the original that gets > used.Lessig, Lawrence. 2008. Remix: making art and commerce thrive in the > hybrid economy. New York: Penguin Press. p. 74 Lessig describes the remix phenomenon instrumental in creating cultural literacy and a critical view of media and advertising that permeates our daily lives. But, as it stands today, copyright law will inhibit education employing these digital forms of literacy for institutions will shy away from use that might be deemed 'illegal'. Yet, Lessig reiterates, the remix form of expression cannot be killed, only criminalized.  Commercial economies vs. sharing economies  In addition to describing two cultures Lessig also proposes two economies: the commercial and the sharing. The commercial economy is governed by the simple logic of the market, where products and services have a tangible economic value, be it money or labor. The Internet has been extremely successful as a portal for commercial economies to flourish - improving existing businesses and serving as a platform for thousands of new ones. It has been exceptionally fruitful of businesses that cater to a niche market - exemplified by such companies as Amazon and Netflix which provide a range of items that could not be accommodated by one physical space. This dynamic has been outlined by Wired's editor in chief, Chris Anderson, in his book The Long Tail. Another obvious success story of a digital commercial economy is Google, which has managed to create value from value others have already created. The sharing economy functions outside monetary exchange. We all belong to sharing economies - most obvious examples are our friendships and relationships. This economy is regulated not by a metric of price but by a set of social relations. Like the commercial economy, the sharing economy extends into the digital realm. Lessig's favorite example is Wikipedia itself. The top ten most visited website relies on user contribution - from creation to editing - for its content and gives no monetary incentive for this contribution. While providing the option of anonymity, the users of Wikipedia have been remarkably consistent with the site's suggestions - be it regarding consistent aesthetic or neutral point of view. A vital characteristic of a successful sharing economy is people are in it because they want to be.  Hybrids  Lessig does a number of case studies of three types of successful hybrids. =Community spaces= Lessig cites sites such as Dogster, Craigslist, Flickr, and YouTube as successful internet community spaces that answer demand of the users who, in turn, reciprocate through sharing content and self-regulating by flagging inappropriate content. At the same time the sites make revenue through advertisements but are extremely careful to not overwhelm the users and disrupt the sense of community. =Collaboration spaces= Collaboration hybrids center on the belief of the users that they are working towards a common goal or building something together. Lessig's notable examples are volunteers of Usenet that help those technologically in need solve computer problems ‚Äì from minor to complex. They are not paid or recognized by Microsoft yet they are instrumental in building value for the company. Similarly, Yahoo! Answers launched in December 2005 has gathered an enormous following of people answering other people's questions for free. They do not participate for any incentive other than to share their expertise and help others. In this category Lessig also cites the now infamous Heather Lawver 2000 case after the teenager started a fan site for J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, only to be constantly 'threatened' by Warner for illegal use of copyrighted content. Eight years later many large corporations have, at least in part, learned from Warner's mistake and Lawver's persuasive argument of the Potter Wars: fans are \\"a part of your marketing budget that you don't have to pay for\\". Thus lighter control of content use allows fans to share their appropriation of content while promoting it free. Everyone wins. =Communities= Lessig's third category lacks the 'spaces' qualification of the previous two because they create a community on a much grander, or more comprehensive scale. One such community is Second Life through which users can immerse themselves in a virtual environment and build a multi-faceted life not unlike real life but without the same limitations, while creating value by producing and sharing new codes for the program. Lessig concludes that a feeling of ownership and contribution is vital to making hybrid communities function. These communities are not built on sacrifice but on mutual satisfaction in which both the consumer and producer benefit. Parallel economies can coexist, the author insists, and are not mutually exclusive. In fact, crossover is not uncommon, particularly in the world of the Creative Commons which Lessig helped found. Many artists that have initially licensed their work under a CC license, that allowed others to share and remix their work as long as they were credited, have used the momentum from this visibility to crossover to the commercial economy. Lessig warns that hybrid economies will do well to avoid what he calls sharecropping, that is corporations forcing the remixer to give up the right to his/her creation (providing they don't own the rights to all/some of its components) even if they plan to use their work for commercial purposes. > The hybrid that respects the rights of the creator - both the original > creator and the remixer - is more likely to survive than the one that > doesn't. Lessig, Lawrence. 2008. Remix: making art and commerce thrive in > the hybrid economy. New York: Penguin Press.  Reforming copyright law  Lessig outlines five steps that will put us on the path towards more efficient and sound copyright law. # Deregulating Amateur Activity. Primarily this means exempting noncommercial and, particularly amateur, use from the rights granted by copyright. In addition, this loosening of control will, in turn, remove some of the burden from the corporations' monitoring for misuse of their content. # Clear Title. As of now, there is no comprehensive and accessible registry that lists who owns rights to what. In addition to making the above clear, Lessig insists that author/owner should have to register their work in order to extend the copyright after a shorter period of time and for the work, otherwise, to enter public domain. He insists that this change would be instrumental to digital archiving and access for educational purposes. # Simplify. Building on his previous suggestions, Lessig insists that the system should be simplified. If a child is expected to comply with copyright law, they should be able to understand it. # Decriminalizing the Copy. As mentioned before the production of the 'copy' is a commonplace in daily transaction within the digital realm. If our daily activity triggers federal regulation on copyright law, it means that this regulation reaches too far. Thus the law must be rearticulated as to not include uses that are irrelevant to copyright owner's control. # Decriminalizing File Sharing. Lessig suggests this should be done either by \\"authorizing at least noncommercial file sharing with taxes to cover a reasonable royalty to the artists whose work is shared, or by authorizing a simple blanket licensing procedure, whereby users could, for a low fee, buy the right to freely file-share\\" Lessig, Lawrence. 2008. Remix: making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy. New York: Penguin Press. p. 271  Conclusion  In his final chapter \\"Reforming Us\\", Lessig insists that in order to move towards ending the senseless copyright wars, which are mostly harming our children, we must understand that governmental control has its limits. The children growing up in a digital age are seeing these laws as senseless and corrupt and, more importantly, trivial as they continue to remix and download despite it. Lessig warns that this phenomenon can have a larger trickle-down effect towards a child's view of law in general. When put in this light, copyright reform carries much larger implications for the morality of the digital age generations. Aside from morality of the generation, Lessig asserts that due to legislation being either too passive or too stern it creates the lack of understanding from policy makers. This assertion leads to the true meaning of fair use.  In popular culture  On an episode of The Colbert Report with Lessig as a guest, Stephen Colbert made fun of the book's status under Creative Commons by taking a copy, signing it, and then proclaiming it the 'Colbert' edition for sale. Lessig laughed.

To the north and northeast lie the Carrizo Badlands, the Carrizo Valley and the Fish Creek Mountains. The west end of the range is within the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and the east end is within the Carrizo Naval Gunnery Range. The international border lies approximately south of the southeast margin of the range. The range consists of sand dunes left over from the ancient inland Sea of Cortez. Seismic activity has raised these. Much of the terrain is still loose dirt, interspersed with sandstone and occasional quartz veins. A dirt road leads towards the mountains, starting off State Highway 2 (S2), also known as the Imperial Highway, not far from the desert community of Ocotillo. There are no marked trails and the footing is treacherous, made up of loose sand, dirt and crumbled shards of sandstone. Most slopes have no vegetation, but there is occasional mesquite and ocotillo, with coastal cholla at lower elevations. The local fauna includes jackrabbits and sparrows. There are a few ancient sand dunes that have been fossilized and hollowed out by winds, producing wind caves. Marine fossils such as sand dollars and snails can be found, but it is illegal to remove any fossils. In 1994, the United States Congress designated 18,631 acres (75 km2) as a U.S. Bureau of Land Management managed U.S. Wilderness Area, the Coyote Mountains Wilderness.Coyote Mountains Wilderness - Wilderness Connect  Geology  The Coyote Mountains range consists of uplifted metamorphic basement rocks overlain by younger volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The peaks and mountain ranges are primarily Paleozoic and Jurassic basement rocks, which consist of marble, schist, and gneiss. This metamorphic basement rock and overlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks have been uplifted and exposed due to seismic activity along the Elsinore Fault Zone. = Volcanism = During the Miocene, around 22-14 million years ago, volcanic activity produced various volcanic rock features including basalt flows, an andesite plug, and various volcaniclastics including tuffs and breccias, known as the Alverson Formation. These volcanic rocks are primarily exposed along the east and southeastern portion of the range, and are best viewed and easily accessed in the Painted Gorge area of the range (where multiple volcanic rock types of varying colors are exhibited, giving the area a gorgeous 'painted' appearance). = Marine incursion = During the late Miocene, initiation of motion on the West Salton detachment fault caused rapid subsidence of the Salton Trough region, resulting in a marine incursion between 6.3 and 4.3 million years ago. This resulted in the Imperial Formation, composed of locally derived fossiliferous shallow marine sandstones and conglomerates that were deposited in a shallow inland sea across much of the Salton Trough. In the Coyote Mountains, these rocks were deposited directly on the older metamorphic and volcanic rocks. The Imperial Formation preserves many corals as well as shallow marine invertebrates and vertebrates. = Influence of the Colorado River Delta = The marine incursion of the ancestral Gulf of California also introduced a single, very large depositional system (the Colorado River delta) into the Salton Trough, which rapidly prograded to the south (Winker and Kidwell, 1986). During the early Pliocene, between 5 and 4.2 million years ago, this deltaic system facilitated the deposition of a thick marine deltaic sequence of mudstone and sandstone derived from the Colorado River, known as the Deguy√±os Formation of the Imperial Group (formerly the Imperial Formation). The Deguy√±os Formation represents the distal prodelta portion of the Colorado River delta, and is characterized by upward-coarsening cycles of claystone, siltstone, sandstone and/or coquina shell beds. As the Colorado River depositional system evolved later in the Pliocene, between 4.2 and 2.8 million years ago, the marine deltaic phase gave way to a meandering fluvial system. Deposition of marine sedimentary deposits gradually transitioned into deposition of nonmarine, predominantly fluvial/delta front sediments of the Colorado river. In the Coyote Mountains, this is expressed by the presence of upward fining sequences of fine, light pink to pale orange sandstones and reddish-gray mudstones, known as the Arroyo Diablo Formation of the Palm Spring Group (previously the Diablo member of the Palm Spring Formation). Further deposition of locally derived sediments continued to accumulate in the area between 2.8 and ‚âà1 million years ago, primarily manifested by the Hueso Formation. Eventually (0.95 Ma), the tectonic regime in the area changed, and basin subsidence and accumulation of sediments ceased. Erosion of sediments in the Coyote Mountains = Recent uplift = The Coyote Mountains lies within a complex tectonic region. The Salton Trough itself is a pull-apart basin that is the result of crustal stretching and sinking by the combined actions of the San Andreas Fault and the East Pacific Rise. Tectonism related to the North America ‚Äì Pacific plate boundary is primarily manifested by the San Andreas Fault, the Elsinore Fault Zone, the Imperial Fault Zone, and the San Jacinto Fault Zone, as well as a complex system of interconnecting faults. These major right lateral strike-slip faults have transformed the region in geologically recent times. Within the last ‚âà1.2 million years, the Elsinore Fault Zone and its associated subordinate faults are responsible for rapidly uplifting metamorphic basement rocks and overlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Coyote Mountains, revealing the complex stratigraphic record of their tectonic, climatic, and paleontological evolution. Marine fossils and sedimentary deposits that once formed in a shallow sea (ancestral Gulf of California) now sit at an elevation of over 2000 feet above sea level. This rapid uplift has also accelerated and facilitated increased erosion and weathering. Wind and rain carve steep canyons into the recently exposed rocks, and transport loose material downslope. Gravels derived from this erosion form terraces as old as the Pleistocene and as recent as the Holocene (current epoch), which overlie all of the units in the Coyote Mountains. These terraces are further eroded and carved into by a system of active anastomosing drainages. On the north side of the Coyote Mountains, these drainages carve into the poorly lithified sediments of the Imperial and Palm Spring Groups, forming the Carrizo Badlands. These processes are ongoing and have continued throughout the past ‚âà1.2 million years. Sediments of the Imperial and Palm Spring Groups north of the Coyote Mountains are deformed by the recent uplift of the range. Brittle and ductile deformation of sediments in this area is consistent with prior interpretations of uplift and inversion of the Fish Creek‚ÄìVallecito basin as a result of initiation of the Elsinore and other strike-slip faults in the western Salton Trough ~1.2 Ma (Dorsey et al, 2011). Continued right-lateral strike-slip motion on the Elsinore fault is accommodated by a network of ladder-like faults known as the Andrad√© ladder structure. This ~7-km-wide fault structure is consistent with a zone of distributed right-lateral shear and rotation that accommodates the right- lateral deformation between the Elsinore and Painted Gorge faults.

Description Aerial panorama of Blue Waters lake in Creswick It takes in a specific area of North Central Victoria, the major cities of Ballarat and Bendigo as well as smaller centres including Daylesford, Castlemaine and Maryborough. It extends as far north as Inglewood and St Arnaud. It encroaches on the Western District near Ararat. Other significant towns include Maldon, Creswick, Clunes, Avoca and Buninyong. Although the region has a strong association with the Victorian gold rush there are, however, significant towns associated with the gold rush and gold mining located outside of this region - notable examples include Warburton, Walhalla, Warrandyte, Chiltern and Beechworth. The goldfields region is more strongly linked to the impact of the Victorian Gold Rush than the discovery of gold in Victoria. As a result of the gold rush, the region contains many old buildings, including celebrated examples of Victorian architecture, some of which are heritage listed, while others have fallen into disrepair and become derelict. Many of the towns were far larger during the Gold Rush than they are now, and there are some examples of ghost towns in the region. Major tourism icons include Sovereign Hill, Eureka Stockade site and the Bendigo Talking Tram. The region is also associated with the origins of Australian rules football; Tom Wills, one of the game's founders, grew up outside present-day Moyston, the self-proclaimed \\"Birthplace of Australian Football\\". Some of the earliest clubs were also established in the region. Aerial perspective of St Georges Lake in Creswick. Shot in September 2018.

It is southwest of the city of Exeter and one mile East of the River Teign and the Teign Valley.  Geography  Despite its proximity to the city, the village is difficult to find, as it is surrounded by twisting-narrow-lanes and deep valleys, tucked away in the shelter of the Haldon Hills. The village is accessed via minor roads which are predominately single track with passing places. The A38 passes within at Haldon Hill. The war memorial has the OS grid reference SX 855 865 and, for satnav users, the postcode is EX6 7PS. The parish is 2,391 acres in size. Geologically, the village placed on the outer perimeter of the metamorphic aureole surrounding Dartmoor. There is a fault running along the valley in the region which became heavily mineralised with metalliferous ores. This made the area well known historically for its mining activities. In Doddiscombsleigh there were many manganese workings, and Jasper could be found.GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth, History of Doddiscombsleigh, in Teignbridge and Devon  Map and description, A Vision of Britain through Time  Landmarks  = Parish Church = The C of E parish church of St Michael is in the village and is a grade I listed building. St Michael‚Äôs contains the greatest collection of medieval stained glass to be found in situ anywhere in Devon, apart from that in the Great East Window of Exeter Cathedral. The panels in St Michael‚Äôs, which were installed c1480, were all produced in the 15th century by the same glazing workshop as some of the glass at Exeter Cathedral. These panels left Exeter over five hundred years ago - around the time of the Wars of the Roses - transported out of the city during the late Middle Ages on a cart and hauled up and down the precipitous Haldon Hill, before being installed in the church for which they were made. And they remain there today, rare survivals of perhaps the most fragile of medieval art forms. The church was extensively restored and rebuilt by the architect Edward Ashworth in the late 1870s. = Town Barton = Town Barton - which lies between the church of St Michael and The NoBody Inn is the historic Manor house; also known as the Capital Messuage or Mansion House of Doddiscombsleigh. The current building in a 17th-century grade II listed building. The first record of Town Barton was in the Domesday Book of 1086 when Doddiscombsleigh was known as Terra Godeboldi under the reign of one Godbold the Bowman. Town Barton was the Capital Barton (Manor House) for Godbold\`s Domesday Estates. This makes it one of the very rare instances of a property truly being specifically traceable to where a Doomsday owner dwelt. The manor of Doddiscombsleigh was also known as Legh-Peverel, but the name was dropped when the manor changed hands, with a Sir Ralph Doddescomb being recorded as living in the old mansion house in the reign of Henry III (1216-1272). Town Barton was renowned for its twenty acres of apple orchards which produced \\"remarkably fine cider\\", no doubt supplying the local hostelries. = The NoBody Inn = The sign for the NoBody Inn The cottage that is now The NoBody Inn was listed as a \\"dwelling houses‚Äù or ‚Äúmessuage\\" in 1837, but, from the early 1600s at least, it was the village's unofficial Church House. Originally called Pophill Howse, details are sparse until 1752 when it was owned by Stephen Diggines \\"the church carpenter\\". The Inn has had a curious role in the parish. It did not formally become The New Inn until 1838, although it is believed to have been informally established in the late 18th century to provide \\"liquid refreshments\\" for the many men who worked in the mines of the hills at Ashton, Doddiscombsleigh and Christow, in their efforts to satisfy the huge demand for manganese for use in the potteries and for bleaching. The name of the pub came from 1952 when the landlord died, and the undertaker and the pallbearers failed to notice that there was no body in the coffin when it was buried in the village churchyard. The same day, the undertakers noticed that they still had the body. They telephoned the inn during the wake and the mourners were told of the mishap. The empty coffin was duly dug up and re-buried. An alternative explanation is that a landlord of the inn was in the habit of leaving his potman in charge of the inn when he went out on business. The potman was either shy or lazy, and when travellers came knocking at the inn door seeking refreshment would shout \\"There's nobody in!\\" External links * Doddiscombsleigh Village web pages References Villages in Devon ","title":"Doddiscombsleigh"},{"id":"20618942","text":"Jamdusan is a mountain in the county of Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do in South Korea.

Parsing statements of the metalanguage resemble augmented Backus‚ÄìNaur form with embedded tree-building directives. Unparsing rules include extensive tree-scanning and code-generation constructs. History TREE-META was instrumental in the development of the On-Line System and was ported to many systems including the Univac 1108, GE 645, SDS-940, ICL 1906A, PERQ, and UCSD p-System.

That document also has a definition of TREE-META in TREE-META in Appendix 3. This program is not just a recognizer, but also outputs the assembly language for the input. It demonstrates one of the key features of TREE-META, which is tree pattern matching. It is used on both the LHS (GET and VAL for example) and the RHS (ADD and SUB). % This is an ALGOL-style comment delimited by % %  INPUT PARSE RULES = % .META PROG % A program defining driving rule is required. % % This PROG rule is the driver of the complete program. % PROG = $STMT ; % $ is the zero or more operator. % % PROG (the program) is defined as zero or more STMT (statements). % STMT = .ID ':=' AEXP :STORE[2]*; % Parse an assignment statement from the source to the tree. % % ':=' is a string constant, :STORE creates a STORE node, % % [2] defines this as having two branches i.e. STORE[ID,AEXP]. % % * triggers a unparse of the tree, Starting with the last created % % tree i.e. the STORE[ID,AEXP] which is emitted as output and % % removed from the tree. % AEXP = FACTOR $('+' FACTOR :ADD[2] / '-' FACTOR :SUB[2]); % Here we have the recognizer for arithmetic '+' :ADD and '-' :SUB % % tree building.

The team competed in the American Association from 1882 through 1886, and has been a member of the National League since 1887. A native of Pittsburgh, Nimick died in Pasadena, California, in 1907. Club ownership Nimick was a shareholder in the Pittsburgh club as early as 1883. In December 1886, shortly after the club committed to play in the National League, The Sporting Life reported that the Pittsburgh club was \\"owned by Messrs. Nimick, Converse and Brown in equal shares\\". An 1888 Pittsburgh Press article names Nimick as one of four equal-part owners of the club. Just prior to the 1891 season, after the consolidation of Pittsburgh's National League and Players' League clubs, the Press reported that Nimick held a one-fourth interest in the reorganized National League team. Nimick sold his shares of the franchise to William Chase Temple following the 1891 season. Personal life Nimick graduated from Chester Military Academy (now Widener University) in 1865 and was briefly an officer in the United States Army at the end of the Civil War. He was involved in various Pittsburgh businesses, was a bank director, and was the president of a publishing company. Nimick married in 1880; he and his wife had three daughters.

The mountain range runs roughly northwest to southeast. The Laguna Mountains are directly adjacent to the east, with Palomar Mountain and Hot Springs Mountain more distant to the north. Most of the range consists of extensive oak forest and chaparral, part of the California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, interspersed with pine forests and lush riparian zones, featuring year round creeks and waterfalls. The San Diego River and Sweetwater River both have their headwaters in these mountains, which flow over 50 miles to the ocean. The pine forests were extensively burned by the 2003 Cedar Fire, along with many large areas of chaparral and oak woodland, which has since experienced slow and steady regrowth. The high elevation results in snowfall throughout the winter months. Cuyamaca Peak, at 6,512 feet, is San Diego County's second highest, after Hot Springs Peak. Geography The range's highest peaks are Cuyamaca Peak at , North Peak at , Middle Peak at , and Stonewall Peak at .Cuyamaca Rancho State Park Interpretive Association The San Diego River and the Sweetwater River both have headwaters in the Cuyamacas. The Cuyamaca Reservoir lies adjacent to the east side of the range. Mountains are primarily protected within the Cleveland National Forest. Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, with California oak woodlands habitat, is located in the range. The former mining town of Julian is in the northern section, and the towns of Descanso, Pine Valley and Guatay is in the southern. Alpine, a more populated town with some dense residential development, lies directly to the west of the range, bordering the Lakeside and El Cajon areas.

He had a long relationship with the United States Navy. In addition to serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Naval Reserve Force, he was selected by President Theodore Roosevelt to accompany the Great White Fleet voyage in 1907 to document the journey. In addition to his artwork, he was a frequent writer on naval topics, and served as an editor of Jane's Fighting Ships.  Early life  Reuterdahl was born in Malm√∂, Sweden. He received his academic education in Stockholm. He taught himself to draw, and in 1893 was commissioned to do illustrations of the World's Fair in Chicago. He decided to remain in the United States, and after his 1899 marriage to Pauline Stephenson of Chicago, he made his home in Weehawken, New Jersey. Although he never had any formal training in art, the self-taught Reuterdahl won a job as an illustrator- correspondent during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In the years prior to World War I, he traveled extensively with the Navy and became their official artist during the war, where he was head of the poster bureau. At that time, he was considered America's foremost naval artist.  Controversial article  As a civilian, he was both enamored by and critical of the Navy. In January 1908, an article of his was published in McClure's that bluntly criticized the design of the Navy's battleships and blamed the errors on naval bureaucracy, whose \\"nature compels it to perpetuate mistakes\\". This was essentially a summary of his close friend William Sims's opinions, who had hoped to create enough of a controversy to force reforms in the Navy, namely the end of bureaucratic control over battleship technology and the establishment of promotion system based on ability. The article had a major impact, causing much consternation among not only the military, but in a large number of newspapers across the country as well. This was published after the Great White Fleet had already departed with Reuterdahl as a participant and when he left the fleet at Callao, Peru because of a serious illness in his family, it was falsely reported he was expelled from the journey. The article itself did eventually accomplish Sims's goals. In February 1908, the United States Senate ordered an investigation into the problems brought to light in the article. Five years later, after much effort spearheaded by Sims and Stephen B. Luce, Congress authorized a reorganization of the Department of the Navy.  Later life  As an artist, Reuterdahl was a member of the Society of Illustrators and the American Watercolor Society. He exhibited his work in the 1913 Armory Show, although he was not considered a modernist. He also taught at the Art Students League of New York. In World War I, he and other members of the Society of Illustrators were recruited to the Division of Pictorial Publicity of the Committee on Public Information to make propaganda posters for the U.S. government. In September 1925, Reuterdahl was admitted to St. Elizabeths Government Hospital for the Insane where he died three months later. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The monastery is located on an island in Lake Valdayskoye in Valdaysky District of Novgorod Oblast, Russia, close to the town of Valday. In the 17th century, the Valday Iversky Monastery was one of the most influential monasteries in Russia and a significant cultural center. The monastery derives its name from the Iviron Monastery on Mount Athos. In the Valday Iversky Monastery, a copy of the icon of Theotocos Iverskaya was kept until the 1920s, when it disappeared. The name of the Iveron Monastery, in its turn, originates from Iberia, an ancient Georgian kingdom. History The gate church Bell tower, and Cathedral of Our Lady of the Iberian Nikon was elected Patriarch in 1652, and in 1653, he asked Tsar Alexey II permission to found a monastery in Valday. By the autumn of 1653, two wooden churches were in use. Nikon also ordered to transfer the relic of Saint Iosif of Borovichi to the monastery, which was done in February, 1654. In the same year, all lands around Lake Valdayskoye, including the selos of Valday, Borovichi, and Vyshny Volochyok, were declared the property of the monastery. The monastery became one of the biggest landowners in Russia. In 1655, all monks from the former Orsha Kutein Monastery, located in the area of the present-day Belarus, moved to the Valday Iversky Monastery. One monk, Dionisy, was appointed a hegumen. This move was related to a difficult situation of the Orthodox Church in Poland. In the second half of the 17th century, the monastery became a center of culture and education. In particular, the monastery started to print books, the second such institution in Russia after the Moscow Print Yard. Production of porcelain tiles, the first one in Russia, started in the monastery. In 1656, the first stone church was completed. Nikon, as well as a number of metropolitans, personally attended the sanctification. For this occasion, a copy of the icon of Theotocos Iverskaya was made and placed in the monastery. Simultaneously, Nikon issued a prohibition to make further copies of the icon. In 1666, Nikon was deposed, and all monasteries he supervised, including the Iversky monastery, were abolished. However, already in 1668 the monastery was re-established, and the former monks, including the hegumen, Filofey, returned. In the 18th century, the monastery slowly declined. Between 1712 and 1730, it was subordinated to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, located in Saint Petersburg. Much of the treasure kept in the Valday Iversky Monastery was transferred to the Lavra. An attempt to revive the former importance of the monastery was made in the 1850s. After the October Revolution, the monastery was first transformed into a labour cooperative in 1919, and in 1927, it was abolished. The monastery buildings housed a museum, a workshop, a hospital, a retirement home, and a recreation facility. The icon of the Theotocos Iverskaya disappeared in 1927 and was never recovered. In 1991, the monastery was reopened. In the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Valday, a copy of the icon of the Theotocos Iverskaya, dating from 1854, survived. This copy was transferred to the monastery and remains there. Architecture The construction of the monastery started in the 1650s. The oldest stone church built in the monastery (1656), the Assumption Cathedral, remains intact. Much of the ensemble of the monastery was created in the 1670s by a local architect, Afanasy Fomin. From this period, the Cathedral of the Epiphany, the Church of Archangel Michael, the St. Michael Tower, and the hegumen's chamber remain. The walls and the remaining towers were built at later periods.

Holes develop as a leaf grows. The size, shape, and quantity of holes in each leaf can vary greatly depending on the species and can even vary greatly within a given species. Perforation is caused by sections of leaf ceasing cell growth or by dying during an early stage in the development of the leaf. These deformations that are created earliest in the leaf development end up looking more like slashes whereas those that develop later end up looking more like holes. This trait is found in only one species in Aponogetonaceae, Aponogeton madagascariensis (Madagascar laceleaf), and a few genera in Araceae, particularly Monstera. It is not fully known what evolutionary purpose perforation serves, but there are several possibilities. Perforation could serve the purpose of reducing the variations in growth rate, minimize chances of leaves tearing in high winds or it could help to maximize the amount of rain that's able to reach the plant's roots. It could also help to cool the plant by producing turbulence around the leaf. Another possibility is that perforation is a defense against herbivory. The holes might make the leaf look less enticing to herbivores. This, however, is unlikely in relation to hemiepiphytic aroids, which often displays this trait, due to the tendency of juvenile leaves not being perforated.Muir, Christopher D. \\"How Did the Swiss Cheese Plant Get Its Holes?\\" The American Naturalist 181.2 (2013): 273-81.

It has been called a \\"compleat angler\\", in that its lure apparatus appears to consist of a fishing rod (the projecting basal bone or pteropterygium), a fishing line (the illicium, a modified dorsal fin ray), bait (the bioluminescent esca), and hooks (large dermal denticles). It is also distinctive for an enormous upper jaw with premaxillaries that can be folded down to enclose the much shorter lower jaw. Systematics The closest relative of Lasiognathus is Thaumatichthys, which also has enlarged and hinged premaxillaries, escal denticles, and a branched upper operculum. However, there are significant differences between those two taxa as well, which includes characters that Lasiognathus shares with the oneirodids not found in Thaumatichthys. Bertelsen and Struhsaker (1977) noted that, given the undefined cladistics of the Oneirodidae, it was somewhat subjective whether Lasiognathus and Thaumatichthys were placed in their own family, in separate families, or in the Oneirodidae. Etymology ' comes from the Ancient Greek ', meaning \\"hairy\\", and ', meaning \\"jaw\\".Lasiognathus California Academy of Sciences. (Apr 26, 2008 version cached by Google.com). Retrieved on December 9, 2008. Species There are currently 6 recognized species in this genus: * Lasiognathus amphirhamphus Pietsch, 2005 * Lasiognathus beebei Regan & Trewavas, 1932 * Lasiognathus dinema Pietsch & T. T. Sutton, 2015 * Lasiognathus intermedius Bertelsen & Pietsch, 1996 * Lasiognathus saccostoma Regan, 1925 * Lasiognathus waltoni Nolan & Rosenblatt, 1975 Distribution and habitat Lasiognathus species have been collected from widely scattered localities in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. L. beebei is known from the north Atlantic and off Oahu in Hawaiian Islands. L. waltoni is known from the central Pacific, just north of Oahu. L. dinema is known from the northern Gulf of Mexico. L. intermedius is known from the western north Atlantic, the eastern south Pacific, and from off Cape Town, South Africa. L. saccostoma is known from the north Atlantic and off the Hawaiian Islands. L. amphirhamphus is known from off the Madeira Islands in the eastern north Atlantic. Lasiognathus specimens of uncertain species are also known from the north Pacific and the South China Sea. They are pelagic in nature, occurring to a depth of 4,000 m. Description Only metamorphosed female Lasiognathus have been collected; there is presumably extreme sexual dimorphism in size and shape as with other deep-sea anglerfishes. These fishes have a slender body with a large, slender head measuring over 60% of the standard length. The mouth is huge, with the premaxillaries of the upper jaw enlarged and extending well beyond the short lower jaw. The premaxillaries are separated anteriorly and connected by a broad elastic membrane, and are hinged with the upper jaw so that they are able to flip up and down. When in the latter position, the premaxillaries completely enclose the lower jaw. There are numerous long, hooked teeth placed in roughly oblique rows on the premaxillaries. The pterygiophore (the basal bone supporting the illicium) of Lasiognathus is unusually long amongst anglerfish, measuring some 85% of the standard length. This bone inserts dorsally on the head and is capable of sliding forwards and backwards within a trough that extends the full length of the cranium and between the epaxial musculature on the front half of the body. The illicium is also long, with a terminal esca and 2-3 bony hook-shaped denticles mounted on an appendage at the tip. The escal bulb is equipped with a flap of skin that allows adjustment of the emitted light. The sphenotic spines (above the eyes) are well-developed, as are the two articular spines (at the rear end of the lower jaw). The operculum is divided into two parts, with the dorsal part split into two (rarely three) branches. The pectoral fin lobe is small, short, and broad; the fin rays number 5 in the dorsal fin, 5 in the anal fin, 14‚Äì20 in the pectoral fins, and 9 in the caudal fin.Pietsch, T.W. (2005). Thaumatichthyidae. Wolftrap Seadevils. The Tree of Life Web Project. Retrieved on December 9, 2008. The skin is entirely naked, without spines or denticles. The coloration is a deep chocolate brown. All Lasiognathus are small fishes; L. amphirhamphus is the largest known species at 15.7 cm standard length. L. beebei attains a maximum length of 11.5 cm, L. dinema 9.5 cm, L. intermedius 12.9 cm, L. saccostoma 7.7 cm, and L. waltoni 9.4 cm. Biology and ecology Little is known of the life habits of Lasiognathus. William Beebe speculated in 1930 that the fishing apparatus of Lasiognathus might \\"be cast swiftly ahead, when then the hooks and the lights would so frighten any pursued fish that they would hesitate long enough to be engulfed in the onrushing maw,\\" though Richard Ellis considered this scenario unlikely. Nolan and Rosenblatt (1975) echoed Beebe's skepticism that the hooks were actually used to hook prey, though they proposed that \\"squid tentacles could conceivably be impaled on the hooks and the prey thus secured\\". It has also been proposed that Lasiognathus might form its mouth into a sort of sieve for filter feeding. More likely, prey is simply attracted by the glowing esca to within range of the jaws. Stomach contents reveal that Lasiognathus feeds primarily on bony fishes, such as lanternfishes and bristlemouths, and occasionally takes invertebrates including copepods, amphipods, mysid shrimps, siphonophores, salps, pteropods, and chaetognaths. It is not known whether the males are parasitic; neither males nor larvae have yet been collected. The six known species of Lasiognathus can only be distinguished by the morphology of the esca: *Lasiognathus amphirhamphus This species is characterized by having only two (as opposed to three) bony hooks on its esca, which are lightly pigmented. The distal escal appendage is elongated and cylindrical with a long, compressed prolongation at the tip as in L. saccostoma. The prolongation has six tiny filaments at the tip and no lateral serrations. The posterior escal appendage is broad and laterally compressed. *Lasiognathus beebei This species is distinguishable by its hooks being placed on a short, transverse, fan- shaped distal escal appendage as opposed to the elongated, cylindrical appendage of all other species. *Lasiognathus dinema This species is similar to any of the five previously described members of the genus, these species is unique in having a cylindrical, internally pigmented, anterior escal appendage and a pair of elongate distal escal appendages. *Lasiognathus intermedius This species has an elongated, cylindrical distal appendage with a short, cylindrical prolongation at the tip without any lateral serrations or filaments. The posterior escal appendage is cylindrical in shape. Its species name refers to its esca being intermediate in shape between those of L. beebei and those of L. saccostoma and L. waltoni. *Lasiognathus saccostoma This species has a slender, compressed prolongation at the tip of its elongated, cylindrical distal escal appendage, with numerous lateral serrations and distal filaments.

This cooling method was first proposed by Claude Cohen- Tannoudji in 1989, motivated by earlier experiments which observed sodium atoms cooled below the Doppler limit in an optical molasses. Cohen-Tannoudji received part of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for his work. Sisyphus cooling can be achieved by shining two counter-propagating laser beams with orthogonal polarization onto an atom sample. The two interfering beams create a standing wave with a polarization gradient that alternates between , and polarisation. Atoms moving through the potential landscape along the direction of the standing wave lose kinetic energy as they move to a potential maximum, at which point optical pumping moves them to a lower-energy state, thus ridding them of the potential energy they carried. Repeated cycles of converting kinetic energy to potential energy, and subsequent loss of this potential energy via optical pumping, allow the atoms to reach temperatures orders of magnitude below those available through simple Doppler cooling. The technique is named after Sisyphus, a figure in the Greek mythology, who was doomed, for all eternity, to roll a stone up a mountain only to have it roll down again whenever he got near the summit.

He attended Exeter College, Oxford from 1682 and obtained his BA and then in 1688, his MA; at his graduation he was appointed a Fellow of the college, where he would remain until 1689. He accepted a curacy at Brompton, Kent, 1689‚Äì95, he was ordained priest by the Bishop of Rochester, Thomas Sprat, at Croydon, on 23 February 1691. His uncle, Sir Charles Hedges, was a judge of Admiralty Court who later served as one of Queen Anne's Secretaries of State. Another uncle, Sir William Hedges, a director of the Bank of England, had directed the Levant Company's \\"factory\\" at Constantinople, an essential factor in Maundrell's appointment (1695), which paid him ¬£100 p.a., with room and board in the Aleppo \\"factory\\" and perquisites. The Levant Company community at Aleppo consisted of only forty men, living in monastic seclusion: Maundrell wrote to Henry Osborne, \\"We live in separate squares, shut up at night after the manner of colleges. We begin the day constantly... with prayers, and have our set times for business, meals, and recreations\\"quoted by Gwilym Ambrose, \\"English traders at Aleppo, 1658‚Äì1756\\", Economic History Review 3.2 (October 1931:246‚Äì67) p. 265. Like other Anglican clergy of his day, Maundrell made no attempt to understand Islam or to read Arabic. He left Aleppo in February 1697 in a company of fifteen men. Their circuit took them across Syria to Latakia, down the Syrian and Lebanese coasts as far as Acre, which they found in ruinous state save for a khan (caravanserai) occupied by some French merchants, a mosque and a few poor cottages. Thence they proceeded inland to Jerusalem, where they attended Latin rite Easter services at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. They returned to Aleppo via Damascus, Baalbek and Tripoli; they arrived 18 May. The descriptions constantly referred to relevant passages in the Bible, encounters with greedy local Ottoman officials at road blocks and checkpoints demanding payment of caphar and confirmed Maundrell in his distaste for the local inhabitants.\\"In view of Maundrell's situation at the time of the pilgrimage it would have been extraordinary had certain unfavorable reactions not been reflected in his writing ... He was a Protestant in a land openly hostile to and contemptuous of Christians, and in which the outlook of other Christians was completely different from his own. These circumstances are reflected in an irritation toward the language and customs of those countries he visited.\\" (Howell, Daniel. \\"The Journey of Henry Maundrell.\\" Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1964.) Maundrell was an observant reporter with a passion for precise detail: > It is concise in contents, plain and attractive in style, and precise in its > natural exposition of facts, all of which make it interesting to read even > to-day.

Operational View (OV) is one of the basic views defined in the enterprise architecture (EA) of the Department of Defense Architecture Framework V1.5 (DoDAF) and is related with concept of operations. Under DODAF 2, which became operational in 2009, the collections of views are now termed 'viewpoints' and no longer views. Other enterprise architecture frameworks may or do have operational views. For example, the MODAF has an Operational Viewpoint and the NATO Architecture Framework has an Operational View (collection of subviews). This article will further explain the construction of the Operational View of the DoDAF V1.5.  Overview  The \\"Operational View\\" (OV) in the DoDAF Enterprise architecture framework (version 1/1.5) ('Operational Viewpoint' in DODAF 2) describes the tasks and activities, operational elements, and information exchanges required to conduct operations. A pure Operational View is material independent. However, operations and their relationships may be influenced by new technologies such as collaboration technology, where process improvements are in practice before policy can reflect the new procedures. The operational viewpoint provides a means to describe what is needed in a solution-free or implementation-free way. There may be some cases, however, in which it is necessary to document the way processes are performed given the restrictions of current systems, in order to examine ways in which new systems could facilitate streamlining the processes. In such cases, an Operational View may have material constraints and requirements that must be addressed. For this reason, it may be necessary to include some high-level Systems View (SV) architecture data as overlays or augmenting information onto the Operational View products.DoD Architecture Framework Working Group (2003). DoDAF 1.5 Volume 2, 15 August 2003.  Operational View topics  = DoDAF = The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) defines a standard way to organize a systems architecture into complementary and consistent views. It is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and is apparently unique in its use of \\"operational views\\" detailing the external customer's operating domain in which the developing system will operate. DoDAF view model shows the linkages among views.DoD (2007) DoD Architecture Framework Version 2.0. 28 May 2009 The DoDAF defines a set of products that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views: * Overarching All View (AV), * Operational View (OV), * Systems View (SV), and the * Technical Standards View (TV). Each view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the operational view, systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships driven ‚Äì by common architecture data elements ‚Äì provide the basis for deriving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness. = OV products = The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) has defined a series of seven different types of Operational View products. There are seven OV products described in this section: * High-Level Operational Concept Graphic (OV-1) * Operational Node Connectivity (Resource Flow) Description (OV-2) * Operational Information Exchange (Resource Flow) Matrix (OV-3) * Organizational Relationships Chart (OV-4) * Operational Activity Model (OV-5) * Operational Rules Model, State Transition Description, and Event-Trace Description (OV-6a, 6b, and 6c) * Logical Data Model (OV-7)  High-Level Operational Concept Graphic  Image:DoD Electronic Commerce Concept of Operations (OV-1).jpgDoD Electronic Commerce Concept of Operations (OV-1).

In addition to examining behavior over time, one can also assess an overall dynamic mission cost over time in terms of human and system/network resource dollar costs and their processes dollar costs. Analysis of dollar costs in executable architectures is a first step in an architecture based investment strategy, where we eventually need to align architectures to funding decisions to ensure that investment decisions are directly linked to mission objectives and their outcomes. The figure on the right illustrates the anatomy of one such dynamic model. State transitions in executable operational architectural models provide for descriptions of conditions that control the behavior of process events in responding to inputs and in producing outputs. A state specifies the response of a process to events. The response may vary depending on the current state and the rule set or conditions. Distribution settings determine process time executions. Examples of distribution strategies include: constant values, event list, constant interval spacing, normal distribution, exponential distribution, and so forth. Priority determines the processing strategy if two inputs reach a process at the same time. Higher priority inputs are usually processed before lower priority inputs. Sample Histograms Showing Results of a Simulation Run. Processes receiving multiple inputs need to define how to respond. Examples of responses include: process each input in the order of arrival independent of each other, process only when all inputs are available, or process as soon as any input is detected. Processes producing multiple outputs can include probabilities (totaling 100 percent), under which each output would be produced.Histograms are examples of generated timing descriptions. They are graphic representations of processes, human and system resources, and their used capacity over time during a simulation run. These histograms are used to perform dynamic impact analysis of the behavior of the executable architecture. Figure 4-23 is an example showing the results of a simulation run of human resource capacity.

She was found guilty of strangling an infant and hanged on Monday 15 January 1894. Early life and marriage Frances Knorr was born as Minnie Thwaites in London, England on 10 December 1868. She immigrated to Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, in 1887. Her father was reportedly William Sutton Thwaites, a tailor from Chelsea. Initially she worked as a domestic servant and married Rudolph (or \\"Randolph\\") Knorr, a German immigrant. She later had an affair with one Edward Thompson and moved to Melbourne, however the short-lived affair was not successful and Knorr had to find a means to support herself and her daughter. Baby farming In February 1892, Australia was in the midst of a depression and jobs were scarce when Rudolph Knorr was sent to prison for selling furniture he had bought on hire purchase. Pregnant and penniless, Frances decided to set up business as a child minder (or more specifically baby farming), and moved around Melbourne frequently using both her maiden and married names. Frances Knorr strangled some of the babies she could not place elsewhere or sell to childless couples. While she was living on Moreland Road in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, she buried a victim in the garden, then two others at her subsequent residence in Davis Street. Arrest The new tenant at the Moreland Road residence discovered the body of a baby girl while preparing a garden bed. The police soon traced them to Knorr, who was ascertained to have moved to Sydney with her husband, and dug up the gardens of other properties around Melbourne where she had lived, finding the corpses of two boys buried in the yard at the Davis St house. Sydney police arrested her on 8 September. The police also arrested Rudolph Knorr on suspicion that he would also be wanted by the Melbourne police in connection with the murders, however he denied all knowledge of the burial of the infants. He was released from custody on the same day, as the Melbourne authorities indicated they were not investigating him at that time. Rudolph Knorr told police that until the previous April he had not seen his wife for 18 months, but around that time went to live with her in Brunswick. They had moved back to Sydney around 6 weeks before their arrest. Rudolph was rearrested the next day, after new evidence connected him to the murders of the infants found at Davis Street. Frances, in interrogation by Detective Keating, maintained a \\"cheerful demeanour\\", although she was much affected by learning of the arrest of her husband. Throughout questioning, she remained adamant that she was not guilty of any crime such as murder. Police kept her under close watch, considering her a high chance to attempt escape from custody. Shortly prior to her arrest, Knorr had given birth to a daughter, known as Rita Daisy Knorr, who ultimately was put into the care of the authorities of the Melbourne Gaol and later the Department of Neglected Children. Trial After some postponements, Knorr came to trial in Melbourne on 27 November 1893, charged with the murder of the girl. She was also charged with having murdered the two other infants together with her husband, Rudolph. Crown prosecutor Mr Walsh QC alleged that Knorr had the female infant in her possession from 8 to 11 April, after which the child was not seen again. Knorr had been regularly moving house and deceiving people as to her whereabouts, and on 11 April moved from Cardigan Street, Carlton to Moreland Road, Brunswick. Once moved in, she sent a servant girl to borrow a spade from a neighbour and reportedly spent some time attempting to dig in the garden. The following Saturday, she moved house again, this time together with her husband Rudolph to a house in Davis Street, Brunswick. Soon thereafter, the following tenant of the Moreland Road house found the body of the baby girl under a few inches of dirt. A letter written by Knorr to \\"Ted Thompson\\" was presented to the court, which stated that the baby had died of consumption and was buried by another man. The letter was deemed pure fabrication. Knorr gave a statement from the witness box and admitted that she had buried the babies in Moreland Road, but claimed that the children had died of natural causes. The Crown however demonstrated that they had been strangled with a tape and that the neck of one of the little boys had been compressed to less than half its normal size. Knorr was found guilty and, on 15 December, was sentenced to death by Justice Holroyd, with a large crowd having gathered to spectate the sentencing. Knorr, who had sobbed throughout the judge's address to her, collapsed and had to be carried out of the chamber to be transported to Old Melbourne Gaol to await execution. The prosecution dropped the further charges relating to the bodies found at Davis Street, and Rudolph Knorr was discharged by the supreme court on 16 December. In a statement made after the trial, he insisted that the babies which had been seen alive with him had been adopted to interstate families, and were not the same ones found buried at the Davis St house. Although Knorr found little support among the newspapers of the day, the public was deeply divided on her sentence. Many letters to the editors of newspapers called for clemency. Thomas Jones, the state's hangman, committed suicide nine days before the execution after his wife threatened to leave him if he hanged Knorr. Execution Knorr was described as a model and penitent prisoner in the condemned cell and spent her time singing hymns and praying. She also made a written confession on the Saturday before her execution, part of which was made public the day after her execution. It read, in part: Knorr's execution was at 10:00am on Monday 15 January 1894. She had spent her last few hours singing hymns. Her last words were recorded as: \\"Yes, the Lord is with me. I do not fear what men may do to me, for I have peace, perfect peace.\\" When the trap door was released, she dropped seven feet, six inches. Death was recorded as \\"instantaneous\\". Her death mask is on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol.

It is serialized in Comic Manga Lynx, under Gentosha Comics, Inc.. It is set in 3000 AD, where Catholic priest Izaya and his mass-murderer teammate Kyou fight to save the world from a series of natural disasters. The manga is licensed in North America by Tokyopop's imprint Blu. Plot It is the year 3000 AD and Airishuu Izaya Luke is a Catholic priest of the Cult of Saint Ruka. He was charged with watching over Kyou, the leader of a group of murderers called Madness. Kyou has spent the past three years imprisoned in Izaya's church, with no memory of his murderous nature. Kyou's life has become a tranquil one until the day the church is attacked by an old enemy, Sae, a former member of Madness, who is attempting to take Kyou's demon sword Jigfreed. Kyou's murderous nature is awakened and he proceeds to kill Sae. He then goes to keep on killing, but Izaya stops him. As it turns out, Izaya is a Suppressor, someone who can stop Kyou when he snaps and goes crazy. Kyou forcefully takes Izaya with him to be his Suppressor and they go to a big city to turn in Sae's head for his bounty. While there, they run into another former member of Madness, Oboro. After a brief misunderstanding, Oboro joins the group and the three set out together. On their way to another city, Oboro freaks out when he discovers that another Madness member, Miyabi, is supposedly in the next city. Miyabi, Kyou's previous Suppressor, was the person who betrayed Kyou and tried to kill him 3 years earlier. When Kyou sees her hawk, he sets out in mad pursuit with Oboro trying to stop him. Izaya gets lost trying to follow them and ends up being mistaken as a prostitute by a brothel owner. Just as the brothel owner is getting ready to have sex with him, Izaya is saved by a female prostitute who lets the owner sleep with her in exchange for leaving Izaya alone. Afterwards, she helps Izaya escape, but right when he's about to leave, Miyabi's hawk comes followed by Kyou and Oboro. It is then that we find out that the female is actually Miyabi, the former Madness member. After a tense stand-off, Izaya convinces Kyou and Oboro to leave. Later on, Izaya goes to talk to Miyabi, but arrives to find out that she had been sold. He goes off after her, and arrives as the man who bought her attempts to kill her, as he was a bounty hunter who discovered she was really Miyabi. During the fight, Izaya protects Miyabi and gets hurt. The blood and Izaya being injured awaken Miyabi's murderous side and she kills the man. Kyou comes in later and after he and Miyabi fight a while, Izaya breaks them up and convinces them to stop fighting. Miyabi decides to come along with the group to protect Izaya, who turns out to be the younger brother of the man she fell in love with. The group of four then sets out on the next town, where they find out that former Madness members are being hunted down. While in town stocking up on provisions, Miyabi and Izaya are attacked. Miyabi holds off the attackers while Izaya escapes to get help and warn the others. Kyou and Oboro are also attacked, and Miyabi escapes badly injured. The group travels to Kai's hospital to get Miyabi treated. While there, they are ambushed again and Izaya finds out that the assassins are from his religion, which is supposed to abhor murder and violence. This information shatters Izaya and he is broken-hearted until Kyou cheers him up when he tells Izaya that it is his heart that tells him what is good and evil. He still strongly dislikes fighting; however, he resolved to put himself in danger's way because he wishes to assess for himself what is good and what is evil. Since he is a Believer, he is using his knowledge of Ruka's bases to help lead Kyou and his colleagues. While they are preparing to leave to go kill the ambushers, they are again ambushed and Izaya and Miyabi are taken captive. Kyou and Oboro then chase after them. When Izaya awakens after being taken captive, he discovers that the group holds his older brother captive and that they plan on using him to discover the true secret of the \\"mad men.\\" It is revealed that they used Izaya's older brother in order to make criminals so the assassins may kill them in the name of god. The Madness members had chips implanted in their brains which was made to make them forget anything but their blood desires. Izaya's brother was the one who made them. Later on, with the help of Oboro's explosions, they escape out of the base, separating Izaya and his brother from Kyou, Oboro and Miyabi. Izaya begs them to come bag safely, at which Kyou responds that he won't die till he does him. This somehow giving Izaya hope, he sets out with his brother to escape. After 2 years Kyou, Miyabi and Oboro had yet to return. Meanwhile, Izaya is found in an open field, along with some children. One of them asks a question to Izaya if he has someone he likes. Izaya responds that he does, and is waiting for that person. Later on, Kyou, Miyabi, Oboro and another Madness member Fake return to Izaya's side. Kyou explains that Kai kept them there for 2 years to remove the chips out of their heads so it delayed them from picking Izaya up. Izaya smiles and understands that that was the reason why Kyou's expression looked much kinder than before. After this Kyou won't waste any time wanting to do Izaya, especially since he states that Izaya has become even more beautiful, embarrassing her, but is interrupted by the others. Kyou takes Izaya to a room and states that for two years, he has been laying in a sickbed of Kai and every time all he thought about was Izaya's face. They have their passionate moment. After this ending, you'll get a kind of map that shows you the relationships of all the characters. Characters is a compassionate Catholic priest of the Cult of Saint Ruka. He strongly believes that there is good in everyone and is first to see the kind side of Kyou. He was a very strong Believer in his religion which advocates God and judgment; that the murder of people is wrong. However, when he discovers that it was Ruka all along that was attacking him and Kyou, he loses faith in himself and God until Kyou tells him that it is his heart that tells him what is good and evil. He still strongly dislikes fighting however he resolved to put himself in danger's way because he wishes to assess for himself what is good and what is evil. Since he is a Believer, he is using his knowledge of Ruka's bases to help lead Kyou and his colleagues. He is often the center of argument in the group because he is Kyou's love interest and Suppressor. As Kyou's Suppressor, he has to keep Kyou's bloodthirsty side in check as Kyou gets carried away sometimes by bloodlust. Miyabi would rather have him stay safe because he is the younger brother of someone Miyabi cared about but Kyou insists on taking Izaya along. Oboro isn't very fond at times of Izaya because of his closeness to Kyou. is a former mass murderer of the group Madness who teams up with Izaya. He has trouble recollecting memories of his past but he remembers that was born inside a cell of some sort and as a boy had a lust to kill. He wields a large sword. He was captured and kept in a cell under Ruka's supervision. Because he disappeared, he was proclaimed dead by other members of Madness. It was here that he met Izaya who was very kind to him and snuck into his cell sometimes to keep him company. He has two sides of him; one side is his bloodthirsty side. There is some speculation as to whether this is due to the chip or simply due to his nature. His other side is very kind towards Izaya. Because his bloodlust tends to get the better of him, the only one to stop him was his Suppressor which is currently Izaya. Miyabi, who used to be his love interest, used to be his Suppressor until she tried to kill him. Like all members of Madness, he has a chip that is inserted into his brain which controls his actions if activated. He has no recollection of having the chip inserted into his brain. The members of Ruka appear to have a control which can activate this chip which causes Kyou to vomit. Sometimes Miyabi and Kyou fight over Izaya. is Kyou's first Suppressor and another infamous member of the group, Madness. She is a beautiful, albino woman who left Kyou for dead because she didn't want to kill anymore. Like Kyou, though, sometimes her bloodlust gets the better of her though this is due to the chip which Ruka implanted inside her brain. She is very skilled with a long sword. She has a pet bird named Hakuou which brings her her long sword when she needs it. She worked at a brothel where Izaya first meets her. Izaya is the first to see that she was not very happy with what she was doing. Izaya lets her come along on their journey because he believes she would be a much better Suppressor than him. She always has Izaya's best interests in mind and always seeks his safety. She sets off to kill the members of Ruka so that Izaya may remain safe even though she hates killing. Kyou despises her for trying to kill him and the two constantly argue over Izaya. is a former member of Madness and Kyou's sidekick. He wields a large barrel gun. He is very loud, jokes around a lot, and says whatever is on his mind without much regard for Izaya's feelings. He is often bossed around by Kyou to which Oboro complies. He often expresses his love for his \\"nii-san\\" Kyou who rejects him by punching him in the face. He is very jealous of how close Kyou and Izaya are and often walks in on them when Kyou is making love to Izaya. is a doctor for Madness and often treats Kyou and Miyabi for their wounds. His \\"hospital\\" also serves as a base for Madness. He greatly values his assistant and android doll Amane and grew very angry when Ruka infiltrated his facility and attacked Amane's parts room. He mentions that his kiss to Miyabi was simply because he was testing her skin. Should Miyabi die, he wishes to graft her skin onto Amane. is an android doll created by Kai as an assistant in the lab. He is also Kai's love interest. Amane is very suspicious of anyone who gets between him and Kai. He first calls on Saint Ruka's assassins to give them information that members of Madness were in the laboratory when Kyou and Oboro came to Kai with a wounded Miyabi, so that the assassins would get rid of them as Amane was afraid they would come between him and Kai. Manga Madness is written and illustrated by Kairi Shimotsuki. It is serialized in Comic Manga Lynx, under Gentosha Comics, Inc.. The manga is licensed in North America by Tokyopop's imprint Blu. =Volume list= Reception M. M. Blair feels that Madness has plot elements from seinen and shonen works and also has more \\"bloody scenes\\". Blair notes the seinen fanservice in Miyabi's character design, but notes that she is portrayed as being \\"courageous, generous and strong, with a formidable temper and strength of character\\".

The film explores possible legal and ethical issues with certain individuals making the videos, and has itself been the subject of legal challenges. A follow-up special, The Tickle King, aired on HBO in February 2017. Synopsis David Farrier, a New Zealand television reporter whose beat focuses on \\"quirky and odd stories\\", encounters online videos depicting \\"competitive endurance tickling\\", an activity in which young athletic men are restrained and tickled by each other. He begins to research it for a story and requests an interview with the videos' producer, Jane O'Brien Media. The company responds with a volatile email, refusing to \\"associate with a homosexual journalist\\" (although Farrier is actually bisexual). Farrier, bewildered at the hostile response, partners with television producer Dylan Reeve to dig deeper into the mysterious producers. After their initial blog posts about the story go viral, the duo receive legal threats from Jane O'Brien Media, who send Kevin Clarke and two other representatives to New Zealand to meet with them. Although their interactions are superficially cordial, the Jane O'Brien Media representatives bully the investigators into dropping the project. Farrier and Reeve respond by following the representatives to Los Angeles to a filming location, but are turned away at the door. Researching the phenomenon further, they uncover information about a person known as \\"Terri DiSisto\\" (alias \\"Terri Tickle\\"), who pioneered recruiting and distributing tickling videos online in the 1990s. They interview independent tickling-video producer Richard Ivey, whose operations are comparably low-key, and also acknowledge a homoerotic aspect. Former participants in Jane O'Brien Media's videos describe coercive and manipulative treatment by the producers, such as defamation campaigns against them, exposing their personal information and contacting associates to discredit them as sexual deviants, all in retaliation for speaking out against the company. A local recruiter in Muskegon, Michigan, describes \\"audition\\" videos he had helped make, which were published by O'Brien Media without the participants' consent. Farrier and Reeve discover documents on a defunct tickling video web site, which link Jane O'Brien Media to David D'Amato, the former school administrator behind the \\"Terri Tickle\\" alias. They learn that D'Amato had served a six-month prison sentence for disabling computer systems at two different universities in retaliation against an 18-year-old male student who attempted to terminate an online relationship.Brian McWilliams (2004). Spam Kings: The Real Story behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn, Pills, and %*@)# Enlargements. O'Reilly. . They determine that D'Amato now lives on a substantial inheritance from his father, a successful lawyer. After considerable effort to locate him, they confront him on the street, to which he responds with additional legal threats. Before returning to New Zealand, Farrier contacts D'Amato's stepmother for comment; she implicitly confirms her stepson's \\"tickling\\" past, and Farrier informs her that he believes D'Amato is still involved in it. Production Under the working title Tickle King: The Hunt for the Truth in Competitive Tickling, Farrier and Reeve raised NZ$29,570 on Kickstarter in June 2014, intended primarily to cover the costs of the crew traveling to the United States for a week. The project also received funding from the New Zealand Film Commission. The soundtrack includes music from Upstream Color by Shane Carruth. Release The film was screened at the January 2016 Sundance Film Festival, after which Magnolia Pictures picked up distribution and HBO picked up US TV rights. In March 2016 it was presented as part of the True/False Film Festival. The film was released to New Zealand theaters on 27 May 2016. It was released by Magnolia Pictures to U.S. theaters on 17 June, and in Australia and the United Kingdom on 19 August. Reception Tickled has received critical acclaim. In a review headlined \\"fetish documentary goes from giggly to grim\\", Nigel Smith of The Guardian gives the movie four (of five) stars. Dennis Harvey of Variety states the onscreen presence of the filmmakers \\"is justified because the harassment they experience in pursuing the story becomes a big part of its narrative\\". The Salt Lake Tribune, giving it 4.5 stars, said it was \\"an act of journalistic courage\\" and that they \\"reveal the harm that can be done by an individual with a lot of money and a vindictive streak\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, giving it a Critic's Pick, said \\"Farrier and Mr. Reeve see the humor, but they also see the pathos‚Äîbecause it's all fun and giggles until someone gets hurt.\\" Armond White of Out magazine was critical of the movie, commenting that it \\"zips past its sexual aspects\\", and concluding that it is ultimately \\"frustrating, a blue-balls documentary\\". At Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 106 critics. Metacritic gives the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. > The shocking truth is uncomfortably pursued to its fullest, and the result > is a riveting piece of investigative journalism. :‚Äî Darian Lusk, New York > Observer Response from the documentary's subjects After the premiere screening at Sundance, in March 2016, D'Amato filed a federal lawsuit against the filmmakers for making false accusations, including the implication that D'Amato used extortion and abused minors, and stating that D'Amato has no relationship with O'Brien Media. In response, Farrier told The Salt Lake Tribune that \\"given the number of hollow legal threats we faced during the making of it, it's almost refreshing to see a real case being filed by real lawyers.\\" In June 2016, Kevin Clarke of O'Brien Media created a website to counter the documentary. D'Amato attended the 18 June 2016 screening at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles, and confronted Dylan Reeve, saying, \\"You need to lawyer up. You need to get criminal counsel.\\" Clarke argued with Reeve during a public question-and-answer session after the film, saying \\"The film is a piece of garbage full of lies. Release the audio tapes that show you're lying. And if you don't release it, it's the same as admitting you're lying.\\" D'Amato filed a $40 million defamation and slander lawsuit in Nassau County court alleging that his stepmother Dorothy D'Amato made statements in the film with the intention to injure his business, causing mental distress. D'Amato died at age 55, on 13 March 2017. The filmmakers posted a statement on their web site that they were \\"incredibly sad\\" to learn of it, and asking that his death be treated with respect.

The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only through the center of the eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. In this way, the ophthalmologist, orthoptist or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the occluder is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole occluder can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole occluder compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of a non-cycloplegic eye. Squinting and looking through a tiny hole made with a finger works similarly to a pinhole occluder, by blocking light through the outer parts of the eye's lens. An improvised pinhole has a similar but better effect. The same principle has also been applied as an alternative to corrective lenses: a screen of pinholes is mounted on an eyeglass frame and worn as pinhole glasses.

The fort was built from 1768 to 1772 and sits on a hill, Morne Garnier, overlooking what was then Fort Royal.Laurence Verrand (2004) Fortifications Militaires de Martinique, 1635-1845, Journal of Caribbean Archeology, Special Publication #1 Fort Desaix was built in response to the successful British attack on Fort Royal in 1762 and was intended to prevent any future attacker from using Morne Garnier to site cannon that could then bombard Fort Royal from above. History The fort took the name Fort Bourbon as early as 1766, Fort la Convention in 1793, Fort George during the British occupations (1793-1802, 1809-1814), and became Fort Desaix in 1802. Napoleon Bonaparte renamed the fort to honor General Louis Desaix (1768-1800). The original fort in the area is Fort Saint Louis, which is located at Fort-de-France, and which is still home to a French naval base. Two other forts were added in the 19th Century, Fort Tartenson and Fort Gerbault. The British captured Fort Desaix twice, first in 1794 and again in 1809. Construction works on Morne Garnier began already during the Seven Years' War, as early as 1759, but, in the context of the war, progressed slowly. After the war's end, work there took precedence. The French Navy (the Marine) committed to spend about 11 million livre tournois on this fort. On 1 June 1769, an engineer by the name of Le B≈ìuf proposed the construction of a lunette in front of then Fort Bourbon. Construction was completed in 1780. A 300 meters long subterranean gallery linked the lunette to the main body of the Fort. The lunette was named after the then Governor General of Martinique, the Marquis de Bouill√©. During the British attack in March 1794, the lunette resisted for 14 days, after holding off numerous assaults and suffering extensive bombardment. Fort Bourbon surrendered on 22 March, two days after the British captured Fort Royal. At the time of the British attack on Martinique in 1809, the fort had an irregular pentagonal shape as it followed the terrain. The British besieged Fort Desaix from 10 to 19 February as they emplaced their 14 cannon and 28 mortars and howitzers. They then commenced an unrelenting bombardment that lasted until the French capitulated on 24 February after the British fire had dismounted most of their guns (some 98) and exploded a powder magazine. The French had had some 113 cannon and mortars, and some 1500 to 2200 men at the start of the siege. Their resistance had cost the French over 200 casualties from the bombardment alone.William James (1837) Naval History of Great Britain (Richard Bentley; New Burlington), Vol. 5, 1808-1811, pp. 206-209. Fort Royal had already surrendered on the 10th, so with the fall of Fort Desaix, all resistance on Martinique ceased. After the battle the British substantially demolished the fort. A Court of Inquiry in Paris in December 1809 stripped Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, the Governor General of Martinique, and some of his subordinates of their rank and honors, holding them responsible for problems with the fortification of Fort Desaix and the loss of the island. The Fort returned to French control in 1814, in a severely reduced state. In 1848 it was restored, but was of limited defensive importance. It was refitted in 1880 and 1905 to house a battery of coastal artillery. Between 1940 and 1943, while under the administration of the Vichy High Commissioner in the Antilles, Admiral Georges Robert, the fort housed 286 tons of the Bank of France's gold reserves, delivered by the cruiser √âmile Bertin. Google translation The gold reserve had originally been destined for Canada. Today Today, Fort Desaix is the headquarters for the French armed forces in the Antilles and the 33rd Regiment of Marine Infantry, which consists of five companies, two of which are actual line companies.

He sang varied repertoire at Covent Garden and English National Opera, as well as at numerous important houses worldwide. With his distinctive profile and memorable stage presence, he made a powerful impression in many roles, from Wagner, Verdi and Mozart, to Gilbert and Sullivan. The Times wrote that he embodied \\"all the virtues that make the complete artist ‚Äì vocal beauty and technique, musicianship, language, dramatic ability, stylistic authority\\".\\"Richard Van Allan: versatile operatic bass\\", The Times, 9 December 2008 Biography Richard Van Allan was born in Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, on 28 May 1935. He grew up in Derbyshire, singing in the church choir in Bolsover and participated in Gilbert and Sullivan operas at Brunts grammar school in Mansfield. He left school without finishing, becoming a police cadet, and became a constable after completing military service in Germany, where he became more interested in singing. He studied at Worcester Teacher Training College, during which he sang in concerts and performed in more amateur Gilbert and Sullivan productions.O'Connor, Patrick. \\"Versatile bass whose opera career spanned more than 40 years\\", The Guardian, 10 December 2008 =Career= Van Allan taught science in Birmingham while studying voice with David Franklin at the Birmingham School of Music. In 1964, he joined the chorus of Glyndebourne Festival Opera, then Sadler's Wells. He also toured with Opera for All. Van Allan made his solo debut at Glyndebourne in 1966 as Second Priest and Second Armoured Man in Mozart's The Magic Flute. In 1967, he appeared as Osmano in Francesco Cavalli's L'Ormindo at Glyndebourne under Raymond Leppard. He sang the roles of the Speaker in The Magic Flute, Johann in Massenet's Werther, and in 1969 he alternated in the title role and as Leporello in Don Giovanni for Sadler's Wells at the London Coliseum. In 1970 he created the role of Colonel Lord Francis Jowler in the premiere of Nicholas Maw's The Rising of the Moon at Glyndebourne. He made his 1971 Covent Garden debut as the Mandarin in Puccini's Turandot. He became a regular artist at the Royal Opera House in the 1970s and 1980s in the Mozart/Da Ponte operas, as well as Fidelio, Nabucco, Carmen and La boh√®me. He sang Leporello in Don Giovanni with Glyndebourne Touring Opera. He also sang with Welsh National Opera, beginning in 1969, in the leading bass roles in La Cenerentola, Rigoletto, Macbeth, Nabucco, The Barber of Seville, Aida and Ernani. Van Allan returned to Sadler's Wells in the title role of Don Giovanni, in John Gielgud's production. He later sang Leporello with English National Opera (Sadler's Wells's new name), as well as the Grand Inquisitor and later King Philip II in Don Carlos (Verdi), the title role in Boris Godunov (Mussorgsky), Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier (Richard Strauss), the title role in Don Quichotte (Massenet), Count Almavivia in The Marriage of Figaro (Mozart), Procida in I Vespri Siciliani (Verdi), Mazeppa (Tchaikovsky), Padre Guardiano in La forza del destino (Verdi), Mephistofeles in both Gounod's and Berlioz's versions of Faust, Mustaf√† (Rossini), and one of his most admired parts, Claggart in Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd, among many other roles. He was the original Pooh Bah in ENO's acclaimed version of The Mikado, one of his favourite parts at ENO. Overseas, he appeared at the Op√©ra National de Paris and elsewhere in France, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Wexford Festival in Ireland, Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, San Diego Opera (where he sang his first Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier in 1976), the Metropolitan Opera (where he finally made his debut in 1987 as Count des Grieux in Massenet's Manon), Boston, Miami and Seattle. His concert performances included Beethoven's Ninth symphony, Bruckner's Mass in F minor, Dvo≈ô√°k's Te Deum, and Berlioz's L'enfance du Christ and The Damnation of Faust (with Sir Simon Rattle). From 1986 to 2001 Van Allan was director of the National Opera Studio (succeeding Michael Langdon). He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2001. =Later years= In his later career, his performances became less frequent. However, he continued to tackle new roles. He created the role of Tiresias in the world premiere of John Buller's The Bacchae (1992) with English National Opera. Also in 1992, he sang the role of Davenant in The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, a television miniseries based on Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Vampyr. In 1994 at the English National Opera, he sang the title role in Massenet's Don Quichotte for the first time. Also at ENO, he sang the Man Without a Conscience in Nigel Osborne's Goya opera Terrible Mouth, and King Hildebrand in Ken Russell's much criticised production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida. He performed in Madrid as Don Jerome in the first staged performances of Robert Gerhard's The Duenna, and in Florence as Swallow in Peter Grimes. At Glyndebourne, he played the comic speaking role of Frosch in Die Fledermaus in the autumn of 2006. His last performance was as Folz in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival. Van Allan died of lung cancer on 4 December 2008, aged 73, survived by his wife, Rosemary, and children Guy and Emma. Another son, Robert, predeceased him.

Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom 3‚Äì69 AR was featured several times on CNN, ABC News, and the PBS documentary Back to the Front detailing the deployment of Sgt Michael Murphy. The unit was first made famous for taking the Baghdad International Airport in 2003. WWII 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, was originally constituted on 15 July 1940 in the Regular Army as Company C, 69th Armored Regiment, an element of the 1st Armored Division. It activated on 31 July 1940 at Fort Knox, KY, and inactivated there on 10 January 1942. It reactivated on 15 February 1942 at Fort Knox, KY, ( the 69th Armored Regiment was concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 6th Armored Division). It was reorganized and re-designated on 20 September 1943 as Company C, 69th Tank Battalion. It was eventually absorbed on 10 July 1945 by the 69th Amphibian Tractor Battalion (the 69th Amphibian Tractor Battalion was concurrently relieved from assignment to the 6th Armored Division). It inactivated on 8 March 1946 at Camp Kilmer, NJ. Cold War The former Company C, 69th Tank Battalion, was reconstituted on 21 August 1950 in the Regular Army as Company C, 69th Medium Tank Battalion, an element of the 6th Armored Division. It activated on 5 September 1950 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. It inactivated there on 16 March 1956. It was re- designated on 14 January 1957 as Company C, 69th Tank Battalion (the 69th Medium Tank Battalion was relieved on 1 February 1957 from assignment to the 6th Armored Division), and on 15 February 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Medium Tank Battalion, 69th Armor. It was concurrently reassigned to the 25th Infantry Division, and activated to Hawaii (its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). It inactivated on 1 July 1963 in Hawaii and relieved from assignment to the 25th Infantry Division. Re-designated on 15 August 1983 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3d Battalion, 69th Armor, the unit was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, and activated in Germany. It inactivated on 16 April 1986 in Germany and was relieved from its assignment in the 3rd Infantry Division. The unit was reassigned on 16 October 1987 to the 24th Infantry Division and activated at Fort Stewart, Georgia. With the inactivation of the 24th ID, and the activation of the 3rd ID at Fort Stewart, the unit was reassigned once more, becoming part of the 3rd Infantry Division, based still at Fort Stewart, Georgia. 1990s Throughout the 1990s, the battalion deployed in support of numerous war-time missions including Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in Iraq. It participated in the Battle for Jalibah Airfield. The battalion also participated in Intrinsic Action in Kuwait and Kosovo Force Operation support in Kosovo. Global War on Terrorism service In March 2003 the battalion, under the command of LTC Ernest P. \\"Rock\\" Marcone, deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom I, where it served as the \\"Point of the Spear\\" for the 3rd Infantry Division, participating in many 1BCT battles, to include the seizure of Baghdad International Airport. In January 2005, the Speed and Power Battalion deployed again under the command of LTC Mark Wald in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III. The battalion was based primarily at FOB Brassfield-Mora, Patrol Base Uvanni, and Patrol Base Olsen. This time the battalion served as the 1st Brigade Combat Team's and 42nd Infantry Division's main effort in Samarra, Iraq. After a successful tour, Task Force 3‚Äì69 AR redeployed to Fort Stewart in January 2006. In January 2007, 3rd Battalion 69th Armor Regiment deployed with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division to Operation Iraqi Freedom V. The battalion was initially tasked with securing the volatile city of Ramadi, appropriately dubbed by intelligence personnel as the \\"most dangerous city in the world.\\" Additionally, the unit was tasked with forming ties with local Sunni Sheiks, including the martyred Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha. The battalion continued its second half of the deployment north of Ramadi, and executed numerous expeditionary combat operations near Lake Tharthar, Habbaniyah, and the southern region of the Salah ad Din Province. This fifteen-month deployment was part of the General Petraeus \\"surge\\" of force. After a successful tour, Task Force 3‚Äì69 Armor redeployed to Fort Stewart, Georgia in March 2008, to train in preparation of future operations. Soldiers from Task Force 3‚Äì69 deployed in December 2009 in support of OIF VII to northeast Baghdad as the main effort of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team-Augmented. The battalion assumed responsibility for an area of operations once belonging to two battalions and a brigade headquarters. The mission of enabling security and protecting the people of Iraq was accomplished through advising and assisting the Iraqi Security Forces as well as transitioning the overall responsibility for the security of Iraq from US forces to the Iraqi government. Following a successful transition into Operation New Dawn, Task Force 3‚Äì69 redeployed in December 2010. Notoriety Bradley Fighting Vehicles attached to 3‚Äì69 AR were the first regular army elements to cross the berm into Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The battalion was tasked with taking the Baghdad International Airport. When the campaign started, 3‚Äì69 AR led the rest of 3ID on the drive to Baghdad. After helping destroy the Iraqi 11th Infantry Division at Nasiriyah, 3ID turned north-west, covering unprecedented distance rapidly. It was temporarily stopped south of the Karbala Gap due to intense sandstorms and a need to wait for logistical support. Once the weather improved, the division resumed its advance, clearing the gap and turning north-east towards Baghdad. Tanks from 1st Platoon, A Company, 3‚Äì69 AR entered the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP)shortly after midnight on 4 April and 3‚Äì69 AR captured (BIAP)later that day, after limited resistance from elements of the Hammurabi Division of the Republican Guard.

As a property scholar, Professor McDougal was famous for asking the question, later asked and answered in United States v. Willow River Power Co.,324 U.S. 499 (1945). whether the courts protect an asserted interest because it is a property right or is it a property right because the courts protect it.See Richard H.

See also Euthyphro dilemma. Professor McDougal was also famous for popularizing in legal analysis the concept of hierarchy of values, and the fact that different jurists' or analysts' resolution of particular legal controversies could be explained as the result of their having different hierarchies of values.Papers relating to the subject were given at the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy, in Boston, Massachusetts, from August 10‚Äì15, 1998, and are collected at this Website.

It is an ephemeral river flowing in Zimbabwe and Botswana. It has a length of 330 km from its source to mouth, 210 km in Zimbabwe and 120 km in Botswana. Its total catchment area is 24,585 km2. The river originates in Sandown (S20.425036Àö, E28.180660Àö), a small farming town located on the Zimbabwean central watershed 50 km south west of Bulawayo and ends in the Makgadikgadi Pans (S20.348816Àö, E26.240166Àö) in Botswana. There is no outlet from the salt pans which can be considered as the ‚Äúdead sea‚Äù of the south. The upper reaches of the river are located in a commercial farming area where good environmental and farming practices have resulted in the river experiencing very little siltation/sedimentation. Impressive sedimentation starts occurring about 65 km along the river course marking the beginning of a 90 km stretch in Zimbabwe where the river passes through communal farming areas. It is on this stretch where the sand-abstraction potential of the river is realised and communities rely on the sand river water for domestic, farming and livestock purposes. Within the country of Botswana the Nata River is a source of water to the ephemeral wetlands of the Makgadikgadi Pans, where a number of species of limited distribution thrive.Hulsmans, 2006 Specifically the Nata River discharges to Sua Pan, draining parts of eastern Botswana and southwestern Zimbabwe.

The equipment consists of a pimple or pensie pinkie ball and a convenient place in a street or driveway where an electric power line or group of power lines bisect horizontally. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation. It can be played with one or more persons per team.  Rules  Opponents stand facing each other on opposite sides of the wire. Limits of play are defined by agreement, usually the width of the street and landmark in the street such as a manhole cover as the furthest limit of the field. The object of the game is for the ‚Äúbatter‚Äù to throw the ball over or hit the wire to get a hit. The fielder must catch the ball before it bounces to make an out. Hits are scored accordingly- a ball thrown successfully over the wire and uncaught is a single. A ball that touches the wire and continues over it is a double. A ball that hits the wire squarely and drops straight down is a home run. If the fielder touches but does not catch a home run ball, it is a triple. If the batter throws the ball under the wire it is a strike. As in baseball, foul balls count as strikes for the first two, but you cannot foul-out. The rules vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.  Tips  The ball is thrown hard and high above the wires. The closer the batter can get to a vertical trajectory the better. It is not unusual for the batter to stand almost directly below the wire.

The club was formed on 29 May 1964 out of the merger of the traditional sides Sportverein 03 Ludwigshafen and Phoenix Tura 1882. They currently play in the level six division Verbandsliga S√ºdwest. TOC History =SV Ph√∂nix 03 Ludwigshafen= Fu√üball-Club Ph√∂nix Ludwigshafen was established in July 1904 and played in the Westkreis-Liga of the regional S√ºddeutschland league in the years leading up to World War I. The war significantly reduced play in many parts of the country and the situation did not improve until after the conflict had concluded. In 1921, Ph√∂nix beat 1. FC Pforzheim in a semi-final contest (1‚Äì0) before losing 1:2 to 1. FC N√ºrnberg in the league final. The club earned another second-place result in senior level regional play in 1923 in the Kreisliga Pfalz before entering the new Bezirksliga Rhein, where it continued to archive good results. From 1927, it was part of the Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar and remained a top-of-the-table side. Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933, FC became part of the Gauliga S√ºdwest, one of 16 new regional top-flight divisions. They captured the title there in 1935 and took part in qualification play for the national championship. The following season they crashed to a 10th-place finish and were relegated. In 1936, Ph√∂nix was joined with a group of other local clubs (FC Pfalz Ludwigshafen, Stemm- und Ringclub Ludwigshafen, Turn- und Fechtclub Ludwigshafen, Turnverein 1861 Ludwigshafen, and Kanu-Club Ludwigshafen) to play as Turn- und Sport-Gemeinschaft 1861 Ludwigshafen. TSG won its way into the Gauliga in 1938, but as World War II made conditions more difficult, play became more local in character and the team played in the Gauliga S√ºdwest/Saarpfalz (1939‚Äì41) and the Gauliga Westmark (1941‚Äì43). The following season, TSG became part of the wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft Ludwigshafen alongside TSG Oppau and Verein f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen Friesenheim, completing one more campaign before the division collapsed as war overtook the area. The club was re-established following the conflict as Sportverein Ph√∂nix 1903 Ludwigshafen and played in the first division Oberliga S√ºdwest from 1945 until 1962 as a mid-table side. They won the 2. Liga-S√ºdwest in 1963, the same year that the new first division Bundesliga was formed. Their title earned the club a place in the new Regionalliga S√ºdwest (II) where they played a single season before the merger that formed the current day club. =Tura 1882 Ludwigshafen= The Tura 1882 Ludwigshafen was itself the result of a merger. His predecessors were the Ludwigshafen FG 03, as the FC Palatinate 1909 who belonged to the Kreisliga West from 1914. After the formation of the Bezirksliga Rhein, the FG played three seasons in this league before entering the Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar in 1927. A fourth place in 1928 was its best result there. The club, now as Tura Ludwigshafen, won promotion to the Gauliga in 1941, belonging to this league until the end of the war. In 1950, the club returned to first division football, earning promotion to the Oberliga S√ºdwest and remained a mid-table side in this league until 1963, with the exception of 1956‚Äì57. =S√ºdwest Ludwigshafen= The new club continued to play in the Regionalliga S√ºdwest after the merger in 1964 but remained an undistinctive side. Only in 1970 and 1971 did it come close to taking part in the Promotion round to the Fu√üball-Bundesliga when it earned third-place finishes. In 1974, when the Regionalligas were disbanded in favour of the new 2. Bundesligas, S√ºdwest's eleventh-place finish meant it did not qualify for the new league. Instead, it had to enter the tier-three Amateurliga S√ºdwest. In 1978, when the new Oberliga S√ºdwest (III) replaced the three Amateurligas in the region, the club qualified for the league. The club pulled off a surprise in the 1978‚Äì79 edition of the German Cup when it defeated the 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2‚Äì1 in the third round. It initially earned good results, finishing second in 1981 but then declined. From 1988, it had another good spell and finished runners-up once more in 1992. In 1994, when the Regionalliga West/S√ºdwest was formed, S√ºdwest did not qualify and two years later was relegated to the Verbandsliga S√ºdwest (V) instead. After five seasons there, the club suffered another relegation in 2001 but recovered immediately and returned to the Verbandsliga where it played until 2013‚Äì14. Coming 14th in the league that season the club was relegated to the Landesliga. The following season it finished 15th in the Landesliga and was relegated once more, now to the Bezirksliga.

It runs parallel to Metra's Union Pacific / North Line for nearly nine miles from Wilmette, Illinois, to Highland Park, Illinois. It was originally a path used by various users between the Chicago area and the Green Bay, Wisconsin, area. Early history The Green Bay Trail runs parallel to the Metra North Line in the Chicago North Shore Area in Cook and Lake Counties The Green Bay Trail has historical significance dating back nearly 12,000 years, when it is presumed that woolly mammoths traveled along it for migration during the Ice Age. This migration made it a destination for hunters of the time who also used to trail their prey. Following the Ice Age, the trail has little confirmed history until the 1600s when French explorers Jolliet and Marquette used it in their explorations of the Americas. Prior to that it has been assumed that the trail was used by American Indians for hunting and trading. The American Indian tribe that most likely used the trail was the Potawatomi, who may have used it until the early 1900s. In the beginning of the 1800s, when early settlers moved West towards Chicago, the trail served as a mail route between Fort Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois, and Fort Howard, Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1832, the trail became an official post road by an Act of Congress. In 1836, the trail hosted its first stagecoach service between Chicago and Green Bay. The trail began its modern-day service in 1836 when stagecoaches were used to carry passengers from Chicago to Green Bay with intermediate stops. It runs along the track bed of the former Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, which runs parallel to the Union Pacific (then the Chicago & Northwestern) North Line. The Shore Line was abandoned in 1955; the right-of-way was then leased to the Green Bay Trail Committee for development. In 1965, the city of Winnetka purchased the section that traversed that city with the intention of developing it with the Committee's involvement. Design and construction Limestone Bench designed by landscape architect Jen Jensen at Glencoe Trail Head, Heading North towards Highland Park Most of the rail trail is paved except for the portion between the Highland Park Metra Station and Glencoe, which is primarily crushed stone. Running parallel to the Metra North Line, riders can access the train directly from the trail at the following Metra stops: Highland Park, Ravinia, Braeside, Glencoe, Hubbard Woods, Winnetka, Indian Hill, Kenilworth, and Wilmette. The trail is wheel-chair accessible. There is also an elevator at Winnetka Station that allows access to the trail. For the most part the trail follows a designated path except in Kenilworth where it runs along Abbotsford road. In Glencoe, the trail also runs along Old Green Bay Road for less than one mile. The work of local landscape architect Jens Jensen can also be seen at various points throughout the trail. In August 2014 a crossover trail was installed running westward along Lake-Cook road to connect to the North Branch Trail. Amenities The trail has parking at every trail head, which is also at every Metra station. It also has picnic areas in Shelton Park in Glencoe and in other community park areas in Winnetka and Kenilworth. Attractively designed benches are strategically placed for resting. In Highland Park, the trail travels through the site of the Ravinia Festival, the oldest outdoor music festival in the U.S. There are no bathrooms on the trail itself, but facilities are available at several parks and at many of the Metra stations along the route.  Connecting trails  The Green Bay Trail has examples of art along the line The Green Bay Trail connects with several other recreational trails including: * Sheridan Road sidewalk path, Wilmette. * North Branch Trail, Highland Park. * Des Plaines River Trail. * Robert McClory Trail. Supporters The Green Bay Trail is managed by each respective town that it runs through. However, when the trail opened in the 1960s, it was managed by The Green Bay Trail Committee. Volunteer beautifying projects including flower and vegetable gardens alongside the trail are also popular. Environmental stewardship along the trail is coordinated by the Friends of the Green Bay Trail, a 501(c) non-profit organization created for this purpose in 2010.

The Shia remember them by the term Five Martyrs. Shahid al Awwal Muhammad Jamaluddin al- Makki al-Amili al-Jizzini, (1334‚Äì1385) is known to Shi'ites as the Shahid Awwal (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸáŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸàŸÑash-Shahid al-Awwal \\"The First Martyr\\"). Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as \\"Shahid Awwal\\" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner. He was born in 734 A.H (ca. 1334 ) in Jabal 'Amel. He went to study at al-Hilla in Iraq when he was 16 and returned when he was 21. He used taqiyya to establish himself as a religious scholars and Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging Shi'ites using Shia law. During the reign of Sultan Barquq he was accused of rafd, defamation of Aisha, Abu Bakr and Umar, he was also accused of preaching the Shia Ithna'ashari faith. A Maliki jurist gave the fatwa for his death. Subsequently, he was imprisoned for one year, then beheaded by sword. His body was then crucified and stoned in Damascus. Shahid al Thani Zayn al-Din al- Juba'i al'Amili (1506‚Äì1558) was the Second Martyr, and the author of the first Sharh of Shahid Awwal's Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (The Damascene Glitter) titled as Ar-Rawda al-Bahiyah fi Sharh al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿàÿ∂ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸáŸäŸëÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ≠ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸÖÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇŸäŸëÿ© ) (The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter). He was one of the greatest shi'a scholars. He studied under famous Sunni and Shi'a in Jabal 'Amel, Damascus, Cairo, Jerusalem among many others. He was known and respected by sunnis in Baalabeck for this. He was authorized to teach Muslims in the Nouriyah Islamic school according to the five schools of thought. He became a Mujtahid at age 33 after his visits to Iraq. Since Ijtihad was forbidden and Shi'ism had a history of persecution in the area, especially that shi'ism was still strong among the people as a result of the not-so-long gone Hamdanid dynasty, some people conspired against him due to petty reasons before being judged in front of the Sultan. He was a widely travelled man, having visited Egypt, Syria, Hijaz, Tihamah, Baitul Muqaddas, Iraq and Constantinople (Istanbul). Always in pursuit of knowledge, he studied from nearly twelve Sunni Ulama of fiqh. Apart from the proficiency in fiqh, he was well versed in Usool, Philosophy, Irfan, Medicine and Astronomy. He was a man of piety, known for his austere way of life. His students have recorded in his biography that Shaheed maintained his family by selling the woods cut by himself during the nights, and then sat to teach during the day. While in Ba'lbak, he conducted classes in Fiqh according to five schools, i.e. Ja'fari, Hanafi, Shafei, Maliki and Hambali. His Sharh al-Lum'ah is a part of curriculum in almost every Hawza even today. He studied from Muhaqqiq Karaki before the later migrated to Iran. In Rajab of 965 A.H. (1558), he was beheaded on his way to see the sultan and a shrine was built by some Turkmens on the site as they realised his stature. The person that beheaded him was killed by the Sultan orders.

He is the father-in-law of Muqtada al-Sadr and cousin of both Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr and Imam Musa as-Sadr. His father Haydar al-Sadr was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage goes back to Muhammad, through the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim. (See Sadr family for more details.) His father died in 1937, leaving the family penniless. In 1945 the family moved to the holy city of Najaf, where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr completed his religious teachings at religious seminaries under al-Khoei and Muhsin al-Hakim at the age of 25 and began teaching. While teaching he became a prominent member of the Iraqi Shia community, and was noted for his many writings. His first works were detailed critiques of Marxism that presented early ideas of an alternative Islamic form of government. Perhaps his most important work was Iqtisaduna, one of the most important works on Islamic economics. This work was a critique of both socialism and capitalism. He was subsequently commissioned by the government of Kuwait to assess how that country's oil wealth could be managed in keeping with Islamic principles. This led to a major work on Islamic banking that still forms the basis for modern Islamic banks. He also worked with Sayyid Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim in forming an Islamist movement in Iraq. This attracted the attention of the Baath Party, which resulted in numerous imprisonments for the Ayatollah. He was often subjugated to torture during his imprisonments, but continued his work after being released. In 1977, he was sentenced to life in prison following uprisings in Najaf, but was released two years later due to his immense popularity. Upon his release however, he was put under house arrest. In 1980, after writing in the defense of the Islamic Revolution, Sadr was once again imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the regime of Saddam Hussein. His sister, Amina Sadr bint al-Huda, was also imprisoned, tortured, and executed. It has been alleged that Sadr was killed by having an iron nail hammered into his headAnthony Shadid, Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War, (Holt, 2005), p.164 and then being set on fire. During the execution of Saddam Hussein, chants of \\"Long live Mohammed Baqir Sadr!\\" were heard being chanted by some of the Shi'a guards.

Duryodhana asks Drona to seize Yudhisthira alive. Drona promises him under limitation to divert Arjuna, from the battle field as Drona can't defeat Arjuna . King Yudhishthira learns it, through his spies, and addresses Arjuna. Arjuna tells him to not worry, as he himself with undefeated streaks will protect him, even if himself wielder of thunderbolt, or Vishnu with gods, assists them, they will not succeed.

There created, caused by carnage, a river whose water were blood, with bones and bodies. At sunset, withdrawal of troops occurs on both sides. All praises Partha with speech, for vanquishing foes. :2. Samsaptakabadha parva (Chapters: 17‚Äì32) :: On 12th day, Duryodhana sends Narayani sena (army). Narayani sena was powerful and each soldier was equal to 10000 soldiers. At time of war preparation, Duryodhana opted this leaving Krishna to Arjuna. Arjuna cleverly shot the weapon called Tvashtra, making thousands of his separate illusion, confounding them. The troops began to strike each other, each regarding the other Arjuna's self. After destruction, Arjuna with drew his special weapon Tvashtra. Recovering, they showered diverse kind of arrows, overwhelming them both. Arjuna uses Vayavya weapon, boring away crowds of foes with steeds, elephants and weapons, as if these were dry leaves of trees.

Indra's son cut open elephant armor, damages his standard and pierces Bhagadatta. Bhagadatta hurls some lances displacing Arjuna's diadem. Arjuna teases him, cuts his bow, and afflicts his vital limbs. Filled then with rage, he, with Mantras, turned his hook into the Vaishnava weapon and hurls it at Arjuna. Kesava covering Arjuna, receives it on his chest and it turned into garland. Arjuna asks the reason of his involvement and Krishna tells him about the boon he gave with all slaying Vaishnava weapon, until it is kept by user he shall not be slayable, and Bhagadatta is now open. Arjuna suddenly overwhelms Bhagadatta, slew his elephant, then king. Arjuna shows respect to king Bhagadatta, faces Sakuni army and uses explosive weapons for felling them. Sakuni uses illusion for confounding them and to shower weapons upon Arjuna. Arjuna uses celestial weapon, shooting clouds of arrows, slewing his followers. Then a thick darkness covers them and from within that gloom harsh voices rebuked Arjuna. The latter, however, by means of the weapons called Jyotishka, dispelled that darkness. When that darkness was dispelled, frightful waves of water appeared. Arjuna applied the weapon called Aditya, drying up those water.

Abhimanyu-vadha parva (Chapters: 33‚Äì71) Abhimanyu showing his talent in Battle The Kaurava commander-in-chief Dronacharya planned to divert Arjuna and Krishna away to chase an army of the samsaptakhas whom Arjuna defeated that very day. The Kaurava army was grouped into the giant discus formation, which caused great loss for the Pandavas. If the formation continued till end of that day, the pandavas would have no army by sunset. The only two people on the Pandava army who completely knew about how to enter and break this formation were Arjuna and Krishna, who were away. Abhimanyu's story came to prominence when he entered the powerful Chakravyuha battle formation of the Kaurava army. Abhimanyu claimed that he could decimate the entire Kaurava army. Abhimanyu was trained in all types of warfare by Lord Krishna and Balrama themselves, and later by Pradyumna (Sri Krishna's son). Abhimanyu learnt the art of breaking into the Chakravyuha when he was in Subhadra's womb. It was then Arjuna was narrating the art of breaking into Chakravyuha to Subhadra. But he did not know how to destroy the formation once he was inside, as Subhadra fell asleep while listening to the story and (Abhimanyu in her womb) could learn only half of the technique. This is the reason why he was only able to enter and break but not come out of the Chakravyuha. As soon as Abhimanyu entered the formation, Jayadrath, the ruler of Sindh blocked the other Pandavas, so that Abhimanyu was left alone. Inside the Chakravyuha, the trapped Abhimanyu went on a killing rampage, intending on carrying out the original strategy by himself and killing tens of thousands of Kaurava soldiers. Abhimanyu killed many prominent heroes including Duryodhana's son Lakshmana, Shalya's sons Rukmanagaa and Rukmanaratha, younger brothers of Karna , and many advisers of Karna, Rukmaratha, Kritavarma's son Matrikavata, Shrutanjaya, Ashavketu (From Magadha), Chandraketu, Mahavega, Suvarcha, Suryabhasa, Kalakeya (Shakuni's brother), Vasatiya, and rathas from the Brahma-Vasatiyas and Kekayas, King of Kosala - King Brihadbala, King of Amvashtas and his son and many others. Abhimanyu defeated the mighty warriors of Kauravas side including Duryodhana, Dushasana, Kritvarma, Shalya, Drona, Kripa and Karna. No Kaurava warrior could escape his arrows. Abhimanyu killed all the remaining foster brothers of Karna due to which Karna became angry and attacked Abhimanyu but Abhimanyu defeated Karna easily. Abhimanyu refused to kill Karna because he knew that his father had taken oath to kill Karna. Abhimanyu defeated Karna 4 times in the war. It is said that Karna flew away from Abhimanyu.https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07038.htmarchive-date=11 April 2018url-status=live}} In this way, Abhimanyu defeated all the warriors. Duryodhana became so threatened that Abhimanyu could break Chakravyuha easily. Hence, a strategy was formed and a joint attack on Abhimanyu followed. On Duryodhana's advice, Karna broke Abhimanyu's bow from behind since it was impossible to face armed Abhimanyu. Kripa killed his two chariot-drivers, and Kritavarma killed his horses; Abhimanyu took up a sword and a shield and killed many foot soldiers with his sword. But later, Ashwatthama and Karna disarmed him. Then Abhimanyu took a chariot wheel and fought on with that. He still managed to kill several warriors. At last many Kaurava car warriors stabbed Abhimanyu from all sides leading to the death. Warriors included Duryodhana, Dushyasana, Shakuni, Karna, Vrishasena, Banasena, Bhurishrava, Vikarna, Durjaya. Sage Vyasa comes with new stories to tell Yudhishthira. He tells him to not suffer and become stupified by calamities, brave heroes ascend to heaven at death, death takes all, this law is incapable of being transgressed. :4. Pratijna parva (Chapters: 72‚Äì84) :: Jishnu, having slain large number of Samsaptakas by means of his celestial weapons, returns, and learning about his son death griefs. Vasudeva consoles him saying, 'yield not to grief, death is certain for heroes that do not retreat.' Arjuna rebukes them to not able to save Abhimanyu. Yudhishthira tells him that they followed Abhimanyu, but king of Sindhus, Jayadratha, checked them all. Arjuna swears to slay Jayadratha next day, if before sunset he fails to do so, he will enter blazing fire for suicide. Pandavas army made loud uproar for Arjuna and spies informed, Jayadratha, who goes to Duryodhana asking him he is going back to his home from desirous of life. Duryodhana says they with forces, will surround him on all sides, to protect. Jayadratha then, accompanied by Duryodhana, repaired that very night to Drona, who tells them that he will form Sakata (a kind of vehicle) array for offence and, half a lotus with needle-mouthed array, for Jayadratha defence. Vasudeva addresses Dhananjaya that he swore alone with the consent of his brothers, without consulting him, is an act of rashness, and taken up a great weight upon his shoulders. Arjuna brags of his celestial prowess with celestial bow and disregard Krishna words. Then Vasudeva as per Arjuna's words, goes to comfort Subhadra. Subhadra laments and doubts Pandavas strength, as they could not protect her son. Uttara (Abhimanyu's wife) and Draupadi joins Subhadra for weeping. :5. Jayadratha-vadha parva (Chapters: 85‚Äì152) :: On 14th day, Drona appointed 21,000 foot-soldiers for protection of Jayadratha. Duhsasana caused Arjuna to be surrounded by an elephant force. Arjuna slays elephants with riders. Killed 2-3 warriors with single shot. Duhsasana's forces thus slaughtered, fled with leader. Savyasachi defeats Drona after fighting for a while. Kritavarman with 10,000 followers comes to oppose the progress of Dhananjaya. Arjuna blasted that army, seeing Drona pursuing. Combatants fled. Krishna sees waste of time and address Partha to show no mercy. King Srutayudha rush at Arjuna, who got a divine mace from Varuna, with boon as long as is kept by him is immortal, but never hurl it at unarmed or it will come back to fall upon him after strike. He hurls it at Janardana, striking his shoulder, mace returns and he dies. Troops fled. Sudakshina rush at Phalguna, in wrath, hurls a dart, which pierces through Arjuna, swooned him away. Recovering, Arjuna felled him down. Troops fled. Troops surrounded Arjuna but fled from terror, again rallied and Arjuna felled their heads. Srutayus and Achyutayus battles Arjuna & Arjuna defeats them. Arjuna invoked into existence Sakra weapon. From that weapon flowed thousands of shafts, depriving his foes of their arms and heads, slew 50 warriors. Karna attacks, Arjuna defeated Karna and then slew Niyatayus and Dirghayus. Urged by Duryodhana, elephant division of Angas, surrounds Arjuna. Partha, however, with shaft from Gandiva, cut off their heads and arms, killing 1000 of warriors. Srutayus resisted Arjuna and struck both of them with mace on foot. Arjuna cuts his arm then his head. Kuru ranks fled. Seeing this mighty warriors Ashwatthama, Karna, Kripa attack Arjuna. Avengeful Arjuna defeats Karna, Kripa and Ashwatthama. Arjuna cuts off Karna bow, flag and pierces 10 shafts making Karna flee. Then Arjuna blasts Ashwatthama's chariot and pierces him with 17 shafts and also pierces Kripa. Duryodhana repairs to Drona and blames his useless formation. Drona says he is old, not fast as Arjuna and he is protecting gate of formation. Drona tell him to go fight himself. Duryodhana says how is it possible for him to resist Dhananjaya. Drona gives him an armor, saying it is impenetrable to human weapons. Duryodhana, set out for Partha. Parthas and Dhrishtadyumna, penetrates into Kaurava army. Drona agitates the Pandava host. Dhrishtadyumna with Pandavas pushed back Drona with his troops. Drona got filled with wrath, and began to kill multiple enemies with a single arrow. No warriors fled from fear this time. Dhrishtadyumna tries to do stunt in battle with shield and sword but Drona cuts everything . When Drona was about to slay him, Satyaki saves him. Dhrishtadyumna withdrew from battle. Drona battles Satyaki, both gets covered in blood, and divisions became spectators of that single combat. Satyaki cuts Drona bow 16 times and the son of Bhardwaja, mentally applauds the prowess of Satyaki. Drona aims weapons at him but Satyaki baffles it with his own weapon. Then Drona invoked Agneya weapon and Satyaki invoked Varuna weapon to baffle it. Sun starts to come down from top. Sons of Madri comes to protect Satyaki, and Duhsasana with thousands of princes comes for protecting Drona. Bhima defeated Drona, Kripa and went in search of Arjuna. Retreated Karna attacked Bhima. Bhima wielding Vayuvya bow was quick with his shafts making Karna collapse. Bhima broke Karna‚Äôs bows. Bhima also blasted Karna‚Äôs spades, swords, maces etc. But Bhima spared Karna‚Äôs life. Arjuna slays Vinda, and his younger brother Anuvinda, struck Vasudeva on forehead with mace. Arjuna cuts all his limbs, then kills his followers. Arjuna horses gets tired, he comes on ground, all rush at him, but resisted by Arjuna. Arjuna remounts. Soldiers flew away from battle against Arjuna, like atheists turning away from the Vedas. Seeing Duryodhana, Vasudeva praises him and reminds his evil conspiracy to Arjuna, to slay him. Duryodhana proceeds without fear and all applauds him. All said,'The king is slain'. Duryodhana asks Arjuna to show his manliness, by using all weapons to harm him and cuts Vasudeva whip with a broad-headed arrow. All shots of Arjuna repelled by armor. Krishna mocks Arjuna of his decayed prowess. Savyasachin then made Duryodhana carless and cuts leathern fence of his fingers. Then pierces Kuru king in his palms. Warriors comes to rescue him, and gets slaughtered. Satyaki engaged a duel with Kritavarma and Bhima attacked Kauravas. As per Duryodhana‚Äôs order, Karna went in aid of Kauravas. Bhima defeated Karna in archery. Bhima broke Karna‚Äôs bow. Knowing that it was impossible to defeat Bhima in mace fight, Karna picked up sword and jumped out of his chariot. Bhima ‚ÄìKarna sword duel began. Bhima injured Karna heavily. Kauravas ran away and gave way for Bhima. Duryodhana with 8 car-warriors surrounded Arjuna. Arjuna cuts Salya bow 2 times and Bhurisrava filled with rage, cut off the goad, and struck Arjuna. Alamvusha resisted Bhimasena. Karna and king Bahlika joined in aid of Alamvusha, Bhima broke Karna‚Äôs chariot. Bhima slew Bahlika and defeated Alambusha and Karna. Karna ran away. Bhima goes and meet Arjuna.

(56)Bhima in that battle killed 20 more Kaurava brothers who came to aid Karna, including Vikarna infront of Karna, Duryodhana. A blood river flowed for enhancing the joy of heroes. Bhima then strikes Karna's forehead and Karna fled away. Satyaki checked all and slew steeds of Duhsasana. Then he battles Trigarta divisions and made them flee away. Bhurisrava comes and challenges Satyaki for battle. Both rebukes each other and then fights. When both became carless, sword fight occurs. When sword broke, wrestling occurs. They did different manoeuvres for encounter. At last, Bhurisrava struck Satyaki and brought him down upon the ground. And dragging him, drew his sword, seizing Satyaki by the hair of his head and struck him at the chest with his feet. Vasudeva addresses Arjuna and Arjuna mentally applauds the Kuru warrior. When Bhurisrava about to whirl the sword, a shaft from Gandiva comes cutting his arm. All reproved the son of Pandu and Arjuna gives excuse. Bhurisrava sits in meditation leaving war aside. Then all the persons in the entire army began to speak ill of both and applauded Bhurisravas, that bull among men. Arjuna says his vows are more important than war rules, but Bhurisrava remained silent. Satyaki rises, draws his sword. All the warriors censure him for his intention. But deprived of reason, he slew Bhurisravas while in the observance of his vow. All gods applauds Bhurisravas. Satyaki gives excuse for his act, and none said anything to him, but all mentally applauded Bhurisravas. Duryodhana sends Karna, saying, victory will be theirs, if sun sets. Arjuna comes slaughtering host. Sun gets red. Aswatthaman fails to resist Arjuna and Arjuna fights all protecting Jayadratha. Use of celestial weapons occur in that battle. Dhananjaya cuts his bow and shot a solar shaft towards Karna, but that shaft cut off by Aswatthaman. Arjuna then destroys Karna car. Aswatthaman, caused him to ride on his car. Then Arjuna, invoked into existence the Varuna weapon on all sides. Then he invoked into existence the Aindra weapon. Thousands of shafts, flowed through that weapon, killing thousands of warriors. Blood current formed on earth. Arjuna proceeds towards Jayadratha, battles him, and cut off head of his driver. Meanwhile, the sun was about to set. Krishna addresses Arjuna and uses his powers to create darkness. All sheathe their weapons, thinking sun had set. And Arjuna taking opportunity, starts to slaughter host. The protectors of Jayadratha got puzzled, and fled. Arjuna defeats Karna, his son and felled Salya's driver. Krishna tells him process of killing Jayadratha. Arjuna using celestial arrow, cuts Jayadratha head and by shooting shafts repeatedly, sent it out at Jayadratha's father lap. As latter stood after finishing his prayers it suddenly felled down on the earth. And as the head of Jayadratha fell down on the earth, the head of Vriddhakshatra, cracked into hundred pieces, as per his own curse. All applauds both of them and Vasudeva withdraws that darkness. While searching for Jayadrath on the battlefield, Arjuna slew 7 akshauhinis (a battle formation that consisted of 153,090 chariots (Sanskrit Ratha); 153,090 elephants; 459,270 cavalries and 765450 infantry) of Kaurava soldiers.

Duryodhana talks with Drona and blames Drona for taking Arjuna leniently, since he is his disciple. Drona says that he will for him penetrate into enemy host. Duryodhana then speaks with Karna about that matter. Karna says, that it is not Drona's fault, Arjuna is accomplished in weapons and the preceptor, is old and incapable of proceeding quickly. Fight continues.... :6. Ghatotkacha-vadha parva (Chapters: 153‚Äì184) :: Fight continues past sunset, with Duryodhana, penetrating into enemy host, slaughtering and making them run away. Yudhishthira cuts his bow, then pierces him with a fierce shaft such that, he sat on his car. Drona quickly showed himself there in that battle, and all mighty car warriors proceeded against Drona in battle. The night became pitch dark, enhancing the terrors of the timid. All these, however, that advanced against the illustrious Drona, were either obliged to turn back or despatched to the abode of Yama. Drona alone pierced with his shafts, millions of foot-soldiers and steeds. Drona despatched all Kaikeyas and the sons of Dhrishtadyumna into the world of spirits. Then he beheaded king Sivi.

Arjuna comes rallying troops and slaughters Kauravas , making them fly away. Somadatta again battle Satyaki. Somadatta cuts his bow and Satyaki too cuts his bow, damaging car in addition. Bhima comes to aid Satyaki. Satyaki make him bowless and carless, then kills him. Yudhishthira routs enemy troops and Drona rush against him for battle. Vasudeva comes and tell Yudhishthira that he is not fit to fight with Drona, but go fight instead by Bhima's side. Yudhishthira, reflecting for a moment, proceeds. Lamps and torches were lit to illuminate area visibility. The gods came there seeing that light to watch. Kritavarman resisted Yudhishthira. Kritavarman cuts his bow and Yudhishthira his bow and leathern fence in hands. Kritavarman made him carless, then cuts his sword, shield and armor. Yudhishthira quickly retreated from battle. Satyaki felled Bhuri. Bhima battle King Duryodhana. Duryodhana cuts Bhima bow 5 times and damages his car. Bhima in wrath hurled a heavy mace, crushing his car and regarded Suyodhana to had been slain in darkness, enjoyed. Karna, the son of Vikartana, resisted Sahadeva in that battle. Karna cuts his bow and despatched his driver, to Yama's abode. Then he cuts all weapons of Sahadeva. Sahadeva left the battle, while pursued by the son of Radha. Then touching him with bow, Karna said, 'Do not, O hero, fight in battle with those that are superior to thee. Fight with thy equals, O son of Madri or return home if thou likest.' Having said these words, that foremost of car-warriors, smilingly proceeded on his car against the troops of the king of Panchalas. The slayer of foes, that mighty car warrior, devoted to truth, slew not the son of Madri although he had got the opportunity, recollecting the words of Kunti. Sahadeva, then, heartless and afflicted with arrows, proceeds to another side. Salya made Virata swooned away. Duryodhana talks and criticizes Karna and Drona. Then Drona, Sakuni, Karna and Vrishasena goes against Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna divisions. They slaughter their troops and routs them. Janardana talks with Phalguna. Karna battles Dhrishtadyumna. Karna cuts his bow and make him carless. Then the valiant Dhrishtadyumna, jumps down from his car taking up a mace, approaching Karna, slew his four steeds. Then turning back with great speed, quickly ascends the car of Dhananjaya. Karna then afflicted Panchala host, who fled in fear, like a doe frightened by a lion. King Yudhishthira, beholding his army flying away, talks with Phalguna. Krishna tells him that there is none else, save Dhananjaya and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, capable of advancing against Karna in battle. Time for Arjuna is not yet so Ghatotkacha must go. Rakshasa gets inspired with greater strength at night, giving advantage to Ghatotkacha, who enters field. Duryodhana sends Alamvusha for him. Gatotkacha cuts every weapon and car of him. Alamvusha, wrathfully struck him, with fists, trembling him. Ghatotkacha chops him, then press him upon ground. Alamvusha then seize, drag and throw him down. Then both uses power of illusion, solicitous of destroying each other. Ghatotkacha at last, seizes him and press him down on the earth. Taking a scimitar, cut off from his trunk, foe head. He then seize and throw that head on Duryodhana's car saying that Karna will be like this soon. Radha's son battles Ghatotkacha. Karna uses celestial weapons and Gatotkacha his illusive powers. All fled. Karna destroys his car. Gatotkacha then started to destroy celestial weapon of Karna, but Karna was not at all agitated and invoked more celestial weapon. Karna aiming Vayavya weapon, destroys his illusion and Gatotkacha shooting an Anjalika weapon, quickly cut off the bow of Karna. Karna afflicts him and destroys his Rakshasa host. The Rakshasa, excited with rage, hurled at him an Asani weapon. Karna, placing his bow on his car, jumps and seizing that Asani hurled it back, reducing Ghatotkacha car to ashes, while later jumps down. All creatures applauded Karna, who, having achieved that feat, once more ascended his car. Then Karna starts to destroy the illusion made by Rakshasa. Duryodhana sends Rakshasa Alayudha, who goes to battle Bhimasena. His followers gets frightened by Bhima but were again rallied. Krishna sends others to busy Karna while sends Gatotkacha for Bhima help. Meanwhile, Karna, in that battle agitated Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin army. Alayudha struck Ghatotkacha, on the head, with a gigantic Parigha, making him in a partial swoon. Recovering consciousness, Ghatotkacha hurls a mace, crushing Alayudha car, but with the help of illusion, later jumped down. Then both destroys each other illusions and gets wounded. At last Gatotkacha beheads him and enjoys. Till that time, Karna broke and retreated troops. Gatotkacha returns and approach him. When Gatotkacha couldn't prevail over Karna, he invoked into existence a fierce and mighty weapon, with which he slew steeds and driver of Karna, then made himself invisible. All gets frightened that he will certainly slay Karna by appearing next to him. Karna covers himself with celestial weapon and an illusion appears in the sky, from which shower of weapons occur slaughtering Kaurava host. Karna didn't fled from battle and his steeds were slain by Rakshasa. At last, he was forced to used Vasavi dart by his army and slew Gatotkacha. Before dying fall, Ghatotkacha increases his size and crushed full 1 unit of Kaurava ranks, benefitting Pandavas. All Pandavas griefs except Vasudeva who when asked by Arjuna tells him that Karna shakti weapon being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain. There is no human being in the world who can stand in front of Karna if he possesses shakti weapon and if he also had armor and earrings, then he could also conquer the three worlds including the gods. At that stage, even Indra, Kubera, Varuna, or Yamraj could not face the war with him. We too were unable to win over him. For his benefit, Indra tricked him for armor and earrings. Even though all these things are not with him today, he cannot be killed by anyone other than him. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech, engaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these reasons Karna is called Vrisha (Dharma). Even if the entire god and demons attack from four sides, they cannot win him. Being deprived of the power of Armor, earrings, and Indra Vasavi he has become a simple human being today; even then there is only one way to kill him. When he sees his any weakness, he is inattentive and is in trouble due to the wheels of the chariot getting stuck, at such a time, pay attention to my signal carefully and kill him with caution. Yudhishthira become cheerless at Karna and griefs for Ghatotkacha death. Krishna comforts him. Yudhishthira with Sikhandin proceeded against Karna. Vasudeva tells Dhananjaya to help him. Vyasa appears and tells Yudhishthira to cease anger, as on the fifth day after this, he will be the king and disappears. Then at Yudhishthira command all rush to slay Drona, enemy commander. The King Duryodhana, desiring to protect Drona's life, comes with army. Till that time, it became midnight and warriors started to feel sleepy. All retreats. :7. Drona-vadha parvha (Chapters: 185‚Äì193) ::This sub-book describes how Drona - the teacher who taught both Kauravas and Pandavas brothers - died on the battlefield on 15th day of battle. Before battle, Duryodhana talks with Drona and rebukes him for forgiving Pandavas, saying he has many great celestial weapons for what use, if he does not use them. Drona says he cannot do such ignoble act, from desire of victory and applauds Arjuna prowess. He tells him to himself face Arjuna with his followers who are the root of this war. Drona forms two divisions of army and coming ahead challenges kings. Drupada and Virata comes to battle him. Drona took life of 3 grandsons of Drupada, who came to support. Next he vanquished in that battle the Chedis, the Kaikeyas, the Srinjayas and all Matsyas. Then he cut both kings bows, then despatches both Drupada and Virata unto the abode of Yama. Dhrishtadyumna beholding those feats of Drona, and death of his father Drupada, became filled with rage & grief, and swore to slay Drona. Then prince Dhrishtadyumna, supported by his own division, advanced against Drona. Arjuna comes from one side, and Duryodhana, Karna, Sakuni, Kaurava brothers comes to protect Drona from other side. Bhimasena addresses Dhrishtadyumna and then penetrates into Drona's array. During that great carnage of the Kshatriyas, all were shrouded by clouds of dust. Duryodhana and Duhsasana encounters the twins. Duryodhana afflicts Nakula and pushes him back. Sahadeva cut off Duhsasana driver head and Duhsasana himself restrained his steeds. Sahadeva pierces his steeds causing them to run hither and thither. Karna battles Vrikodara and coming close to each other in car, an encounter with mace happens. Bhimasena damages Karna car, then hurl his mace. Then Bhima cut off the standard, bow and leathern fence of Karna. Karna fled out of fear. Drona and Arjuna, fought with each other in battle. Drona failed to gain any ascendency over Arjuna. Drona applauded the latter in his heart. Celestial comes to witness that fight and an invisible voice praises both. Drona, invokes into existence the Brahma weapon and Partha baffles it by a Brahma weapon of his own. Duhsasana encounters Dhrishtadyumna and both afflicts each other. Dhrishtadyumna forced him to turn back, scattering his arrows, and proceeded against Drona. Kritavarman with 3 brothers comes to oppose Dhrishtadyumna and the twins comes from other side to protect him. Duryodhana rush against Dhrishtadyumna but Satyaki stops him. Duryodhana recalls his friendship with him of childhood days, before battle. Duryodhana cut off in twain his bow, then afflicts him. Satyaki afflicts him in return and Duryodhana rest awhile. Karna tries to come but Bhima stops him. Yudhishthira rallies troops against Drona. The Pandavas three crooked-minded warriors, who were Bhimasena and the twins hatches plan with Dhananjaya to kill Drona, but Drona grounded and crushed those heroic combatants. Kesava seeing Drona afflicting all addresses Arjuna that by fair means Drona cannot be defeated, when, however, he lays aside his weapons, he becomes capable of being slain. He discusses if his son Aswatthaman falls, he will cease to fight. Arjuna disapproves but others approves. Bhima slays an elephant naming it Aswatthaman and approaching Drona with bashfulness began to exclaim untrue aloud,'Aswatthaman hath been slain.' Drona however recollecting the prowess of his son, regarded it false. Drona rush towards Dhrishtadyumna army and invoking into existence the Brahma weapon slew 20,000 Panchalas. Then he cut off the head of Vasudana and killed his 11,100 soldiers. Beholding Drona exterminating Kshatriyas, seven Rishis with other celestial sages appears and ask him to stop the slaughter, saying his time had come in men world and he had, with Brahma weapon, burnt men on earth that are unacquainted with weapons, which is not righteous. Hearing these words, Drona became exceedingly cheerless in battle. He proceeds to Yudhishthira as to enquire whether his son had been slain or not, as Yudhishthira never spoken an untruth, even for wealth, and Drona didn't ask anybody else. Govinda knowing this before addressed Yudhishthira that if Drona fighteth so on, his army will be annihilated and sometimes, falsehood is better than truth, if it saves life, one is not touched by sin. Bhimasena tells him about his plan and ask him to lie, as he is reputed to be truthful, all will believe his words. When asked, Yudhishthira said that Ashwatthama (elephant) is dead, with word elephant he spoke within his mouth. Drona in grief becomes vulnerable, and Dhrishtadyumna fixed a shaft to slay him. The preceptor prepared for defence but due his mental instability, the celestial weapons, no longer appeared at his bidding. Then taking up a bow, fought with Dhrishtadyumna and mangled his antagonist. Drona cuts his bow 2 times, felled his driver, and cut off most of his weapons. Then Drona cuts joints of his car. Dhrishtadyumna then taking a sword and shield rush towards Drona covering himself under shelter. Those movements of his were highly applauded by all the troops. Then Drona killed steeds by hurling a dart behind which Dhrishtadyumna was hiding. Dhrishtadyumna did different moves with sword and beholding those beautiful evolutions of Dhrishtadyumna, all the warriors and also the celestials assembled there, were filled with wonder. The regenerate Drona then, cut off the sword&shield; and when Drona was about to slay Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki rescues him. Kesava and Dhananjaya praises Satyaki. Duryodhana, Kripa, and Karna comes for battle, and king Yudhishthira, two sons of Madri and Bhimasena comes to protect Satyaki. Use of celestial weapons occur in that battle. Yudhishthira then rallies troops against Drona and for supporting Dhrishtadyumna. Drona then despatched to Yama's abode 124,000 Kshatriyas, by means of Brahma weapon. Bhima rescues Dhrishtadyumna and take him on his car. Dhrishtadyumna again battles Drona and both invokes into existence the Brahma and diverse other celestial weapons. Dhrishtadyumna destroys all the weapons of Bharadwaja's son, then began to slaughter his army. Drona cuts his bow and pierces the vitals of the prince, making him tremble in pain. Bhima seeing this approaches Drona and says,'Thoust only son is slain, why dost thou not feel ashamed ? He for whom thou hast taken up weapons, and for whom thou livest, he, deprived of life, lieth today on the field of battle, unknown to thee and behind thy back. King Yudhishthira the just hath told thee this. It behoveth thee not to doubt this fact.' Drona in grief began loudly to take the name of Aswatthaman, laying aside his weapons, then sat down on his car in meditation. Dhrishtadyumna taking opportunity, for the revenge of his father's & sons death and also for his humiliation of defeat at Drona's hands, with his sword, lopped off from trunk that speechless head. Dhrishtadyumna enjoys, shouting and whirling his sword. Disregarding the cries of all kings of seizing, he slew Drona. Covered with Drona's blood, he comes down and throws down that head of Bhardwaja's son before Kaurava army. Beholding that, all soldiers ran away. The Pandavas, gaining victory, begin to make loud sounds. Bhima embracing Dhrishtadyumna says, 'I will again embrace thee, O son of Prishata, as one crowned with victory, when that wretch of a Suta's son shall be slain in battle, as also that other wretch, viz., Duryodhana.' :8. Narayanastra-mokshana parva (Chapters: 194‚Äì204) :: Kripa tells Ashwatthaman of the unjust death of his father, upsetting him. Drona's son then filled with wrath, returns to the battlefield, telling Duryodhana he is going to use a weapon, no one knoweth on the other side and vows to slay Dhristadyumna with his Panchala army, before his peace. He invokes the weapon of mass destruction, so-called the Narayana weapon, in anger. Meanwhile on Pandavas side, Arjuna talks about morality with Yudhishthira. Bhimasena says they must not fear Drona's son, as he himself will vanquish him. Dhrishtadyumna says, he did nothing wrong, and if by slaying Bhagadatta and Bhishma, he regard that act to be righteous, do not regard his act unrighteous. He tells Arjuna to not reapproach him, he forgive his fault of his speech this time. Arjuna starts to cry, and Satyaki seeing this rebukes him saying, this sinful wretch should be slain by all. Dhrishtadyumna says, powerful forgives weak one, so do he. He criticizes his act of slaughtering armless Bhurisravas, with the help of Arjuna, after his bad beating at the hands of Bhurisravas, and blaming others for righteousness. Dhristadyumna tells him if he will again repeat such harsh words, he will despatch him to Yama's abode. Satyaki, grasping a mace, rush towards that prince saying, he will not speak harshly to him, but will slay him, deserving as he art of slaughter. Bhima urged by Vasudeva seizes him and Sahadeva talks about peace. Dhrishtadyumna smilingly says, release that wight, who is proud of his prowess, he will battle him and after killing him, battle for Pandavas. Then Vasudeva and king Yudhishthira, with great effort, succeeded in pacifying them. Then Narayana weapon take its effect, killing thousands of soldiers. The Narayana weapon has the power to kill everyone who is armed. Krishna realizes the power and scale of the Narayana weapon. He tell everyone to throw down their weapons, and alighting from their vehicles, lay down on ground. Bhima resists and reminds Arjuna his vow of not throwing Gandiva. Arjuna leaving Gandiva comes down from car and tells Bhima to do same. But Bhima rush towards Drona's son fearlessly and that fiery weapon falls upon him. Beholding Bhima overwhelmed by that weapon, Dhananjaya, covered Bhima in Varuna (water) weapon, saving him. Arjuna and Vasudeva ran towards Bhima to check him, unarmed, thus the weapon consumed them not. Vasudeva ask Bhima, 'How is it' and drags him down from his car, laying aside his weapons. As there was now none armed to challenge that weapon, the Narayana weapon, that scorcher of foes, became pacified, saving the Pandavas brothers and their army. Duryodhana address Aswatthaman to use that weapon again, but Aswatthaman says it can only be used once in lifetime. Duryodhana then tells him to use other weapons. Remembering the slaughter of his sire, Aswatthaman then rush against Dhrushtadyumna. He cut off his bow and car, and then mangles his troops. Panchalas fled and then he afflicted Dhrishtadyumna. Satyaki comes against him and afflicts him. He cut off Aswatthaman bow, car and deeply pierces him. Aswatthaman return on new car and again get mangled by Satyaki. Aswatthaman then addressing Satyaki, shot an arrow, which piercing through the armor and body of Satyaki, entered the earth. Blood flowed from his wound, and he sat down on his car. Seeing him covered all over with blood, his driver bore him away from Drona's son. 5 warriors comes with Bhimasena among them against Aswatthaman, who afflicts them all. He then cuts Bhima's bow, cuts arms&head; of Sudarsana, Paurava, and prince of Chedis. The mighty-armed Bhima then, cut off Drona's son bow, and with 10 golden arrows, pierced Aswatthaman shoulders. Deeply pierced, he supported himself on flagstaff, bathed in blood. Then cutting off Bhima's bow 2 times, he deeply pierced his driver, felling him into a swoon. Steeds ran away, taking Bhima along. Seeing his force broken, Dhananjaya comes, rallying his troops. Arjuna addresses him harshly to fight, and Aswatthaman became highly angry with him. The valiant Aswatthaman , then, invoked the high-tier Agneya weapon, aiming at all in his vicinity. With the fiery flames of that weapon, hostiles warriors fell down like trees burnt by a raging fire, a thick gloom suddenly shrouded the Pandava host, the sun was no longer visible, the very waters heated, huge elephants fell down on the earth all around uttering fierce cries, others scorched by that weapon ran hither and tither and fell down at last. Beholding the Pandava army thus burning, Kauravas filled with joy. Then Arjuna, invoked into existence the Brahma weapon, dispelling all smokes and dust created. Burnt by the energy of that weapon, a full 1 unit laid low of Pandava troops. Arjuna's car remained unharmed, as both hosts thought that Kesava and Arjuna had perished. The Pandavas seeing them unwounded filled with joy. Drona's son became exceedingly cheerless and ran away from the fight. On his way, he met Vyasa, and saluting him he asked, why his weapon became fruitless, as the two Krishnas were alive. Vyasa tells him about Nara and Narayana concept, and armies were withdrawn for nightly rest. :: Ashwatthama retires from the battle field, an action that saves him from the destruction in days of war ahead. Ashwatthama reappears after the war ends, and takes his revenge in Sauptika Parva. Later Dhananjaya talks Vyasa about a warrior he saw fighting with a lance on his side. Vyasa tell him he was Sankara, who was protecting his side from Aswatthaman, Karna and Kripa. Vyasa ask him to salute Isana and tell him about Shiva's legends. Vyasa tell him, to go and fight, defeat is not for him, since he had Janardana on his side for his advicer and protector. English translations Drona Parva was composed in Sanskrit.

Parvas in Mahabharata Kurukshetra War ","title":"Drona Parva"},{"id":"20620848","text":"A sailor and a man on shore, both sounding the depth with a line Depth sounding refers to the act of measuring depth. It is often referred to simply as sounding. Data taken from soundings are used in bathymetry to make maps of the floor of a body of water, and were traditionally shown on nautical charts in fathoms and feet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency responsible for bathymetric data in the United States, still uses fathoms and feet on nautical charts. In other countries, the International System of Units (metres) has become the standard for measuring depth. Terminology \\"Sounding\\" derives from the Old English sund, meaning \\"swimming, water, sea\\"; it is not related to the word sound in the sense of noise or tones, but to sound, a geographical term. Traditional terms for soundings are a source for common expressions in the English language, notably \\"deep six\\" (a sounding of 6 fathoms). On the Mississippi River in the 1850s, the leadsmen also used old-fashioned words for some of the numbers; for example instead of \\"two\\" they would say \\"twain\\". Thus when the depth was two fathoms, they would call \\"by the mark twain!\\". The American writer Mark Twain, a former river pilot, likely took his pen name from this cry. The term lives on in today's world in echo sounding, the technique of using sonar to measure depth. History =Lead and line= Lead and line sounding A sounding line or lead line is a length of thin rope with a plummet, generally of lead, at its end. Regardless of the actual composition of the plummet, it is still called a \\"lead\\". Leads were swung, or cast, by a leadsman, usually standing in the chains of a ship, up against the shrouds. Measuring the depth of water by lead and line dates back to ancient civilization. It continues in widespread use today in recreational boating and as a backup to electronic echo sounding devices which are prone to failure and inaccuracy. Greek and Roman navigators are known to have used sounding leads, some of which have been uncovered by archaeologists. Sounding by lead and line continued throughout the medieval and early modern periods and is still commonly used today. The Bible describes lead and line sounding in Acts, whilst the Bayeux Tapestry documents the use of a sounding lead during William the Conqueror's 1066 landing in England. Lead and line sounding operates alongside sounding poles, and/or echo sounding devices particularly when navigating in shallower waters and on rivers. Sounding leads At sea, in order to avoid repeatedly hauling in and measuring the wet line by stretching it out with one's arms, it is common practice to tie marks at intervals along the line. These marks are made of leather, calico, serge and other materials, and so shaped and attached that it is possible to \\"read\\" them by eye during the day or by feel at night. Traditionally the marks were at every second or third fathom: at 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 20 fathoms. The \\"leadsman\\" called out the depth as he read it off the line. If the depth was at a mark he would call \\"by the mark\\" followed by the number, while if it was between two marks, he would call \\"by the deep\\" followed by the estimated number; thus \\"by the mark five,\\" since there is a five-fathom mark, but \\"by the deep six,\\" since there is no six- fathom mark. Fractions would be called out by preceding the number with the phrases \\"and a half,\\" \\"and a quarter,\\" or \\"a quarter less\\"; thus 4 3/4 fathoms would be called as \\"a quarter less five,\\" 3 1/2 as \\"and a half three,\\" and so on. Where the depth was greater than 20 fathoms the line would commonly be marked with a single knot at 25 fathoms, two knots at 30, and so on. Soundings may also be taken to establish the ship's position as an aid in navigation, not merely for safety. Soundings of this type were usually taken using leads that had a wad of tallow in a concavity at the bottom of the plummet. The tallow would bring up part of the bottom sediment (sand, pebbles, clay, shells) and allow the ship's officers to better estimate their position by providing information useful for pilotage and anchoring. If the plummet came up clean, it meant the bottom was rock. Nautical charts provide information about the seabed materials at particular locations. Nautical charts also include depth contour lines. It is thus sometimes possible to navigate in poor visibility by noting which contour line one is closest to. =Mechanisation= Edward Massey's sounding machine During the nineteenth century, a number of attempts were made to mechanise depth sounding. Designs ranged from complex brass machines to relatively simple pulley systems. Navies around the world, particularly the Royal Navy in Britain, were concerned about the reliability of lead and line sounding. The introduction of new machines was understood as a way to introduce standardised practices for sounding in a period in which naval discipline was of great concern. One of the most widely adopted sounding machines was developed in 1802 by Edward Massey, a clockmaker from Staffordshire. The machine was designed to be fixed to a sounding lead and line. It featured a rotor which turned a dial as the lead sank to the sea floor. On striking the sea floor, the rotor would lock. Massey's sounding machine could then be hauled in and the depth could be read off the dials in fathoms. By 1811, the Royal Navy had purchased 1,750 of these devices: one for every ship in commission during the Napoleonic Wars. The Board of Longitude was instrumental in convincing the Royal Navy to adopt Massey's machine. Massey's was not the only sounding machine adopted during the nineteenth century. The Royal Navy also purchased a number of Peter Burt's buoy and nipper device. This machine was quite different from Massey's. It consisted of an inflatable canvas bag (the buoy) and a spring-loaded wooden pulley block (the nipper). Again, the device was designed to operate alongside a lead and line. In this case, the buoy would be pulled behind the ship and the line threaded through the pulley. The lead could then be released. The buoy ensured that the lead fell perpendicular to the sea floor even when the ship was moving. The spring-loaded pulley would then catch the rope when the lead hit the sea bed, ensuring an accurate reading of the depth. Both Massey and Burt's machines were designed to operate in relatively shallow waters (up to 150 fathoms). With the growth of seabed telegraphy in the later nineteenth century, new machines were introduced to measure much greater depths of water. The most widely adopted deep-sea sounding machine in the nineteenth century was Kelvin's sounding machine, designed by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and patented in 1876. This operated on the same principle as lead and line sounding. In this case, the line consisted of a drum of piano wire whilst the lead was of a much greater weight. Later versions of Kelvin's machine also featured a motorised drum in order to facilitate the winding and unwinding of the line. These devices also featured a dial which recorded the length of line let out. =Echo sounding= Both lead-and-line technology and sounding machines were used during the twentieth century, but by the twenty-first, echo sounding has increasingly displaced both of those methods. A sounding line can still be found on many vessels as a backup to electronic depth sounding in the event of malfunction. GPS has largely replaced the sextant and chronometer to establish one's position at sea, but many mariners still carry a sextant and chronometer as a backup. So too with sounding lines. While the echo sounder is used so long as it works, the sounding line is there when it doesn't work. Many small craft still rely solely on a sounding line. The first practical fathometer (literally \\"fathom measurer\\"), which determined water depth by measuring the time required for an echo to return from a high-pitched sound sent through the water and reflected from the sea floor, was invented by Herbert Grove Dorsey and patented in 1928.

The crowning incident of this Parva is the final confrontation between Karna and Arjuna, in which Karna is killed.Bibek Debroy (2013), The Mahabharata, Volume 7, Penguin, , Section 73 - Karna Parva Structure and chapters This Parva (book) traditionally has 96 adhyayas (chapters).Karna Parva The Mahabharata, Translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt (1897) =16th day war= After learning of the deceptive way his father was killed, Ashwatthama became filled with wrath and invoked the celestial weapon called the Narayanastra, against the Pandavas. When the weapon was invoked, violent winds began to blow, peals of thunder are heard, and an arrow pierced every Pandava soldier. This had put fear into the Pandava army, but Krishna by stopping the troops advised that the army lay down all its weapons and surrender to the weapon. As himself being the incarnation of Narayana, he knew about the weapon, as the weapon only targets an armed person while ignoring unarmed ones. After getting their soldiers to disarm (including Bhima with some difficulty), the astra passed by harmlessly. Narayanastra failed to harm Arjuna and Krishna as they both were divine persons (Krishna himself is Narayana and Arjuna is Nara). When urged by Duryodhana to use the weapon again, desirous of victory, Aswatthama sadly responded that if the weapon is used again, it would turn on its user. Narayanastra destroyed one Akshauhini of Pandava army completely. After the use of Narayanastra, a terrible war between both armies took place. Ashvatthama defeated Dhrishtadyumna in direct combat, but failed to kill him as Satyaki covered his retreat.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharatha Book 7: Drona page 478-479 Aswathama defeated Satyaki, Bhima, Drishtadyumna, October 2003, Retrieved 2015-01-13 On 16th day of war, Karna was appointed to protect Dushyasana from clutches of Bhima. Bhima defeated Karna in archery. Soon Karna picked up sword and rushed on to Bhima. Soon they engaged in sword fight, when Bhima was about to stab Karna, Karna's son Banasena came in aid of his father. On seeing Banasena, Bhima got angered as his own son Ghatotkacha was slain by Karna. Banasena challenged Bhima and soon attacked Bhima with mace. Bhima brutally but fairly killed Banasena infront of Karna. Bhima killed Banasena by hitting him several times on head, chest and abdomen regions . Seeing his son's fate; Karna quickly picked up a mace and attacked Bhima. Still in anger, Bhima beat Karna several times and almost took Karna to death. But Bhima spared Karna remembering Arjuna's oath of assassinating Karna. Bhima asked Karna to take his son's body to perform funerals and later fight with Arjuna. Then Bhima headed to kill Dussasana. Bhima engaged in duel with Dushyasana. First they fought by means of archery. Bhima broke Dushyasana's bow. Dushyasana took sword, Bhima cut off sword. Bhima cut all weapons in similar manner till Dushyasana took mace. When Dushyasana took up mace, Bhima also took his mace. Soon both started mace duel with each other. Bhima beat Dushyasana many times with his mace. Bhima broke Dushyasana's mace. Both of them began wrestling. Finally Bhima defeated and brutally killed Dussasana in front of Duryodhana. Bhima killed Dussasana by separating and detaching his hands from the body. Bhima beat Dussasana in heart region. Bhima squeezed blood from Dussasana's heart and dressed Draupadi's hair. Bhima also drank off remaining blood and fulfilled his oath. =17th day war= On the 17th day of war, Bhima defeated Karna and made him unconscioushttps://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m08/m08050.htm. Shalya took Karna away from Battle field. In very early hours, after the sunrise; Trigartas and Samsaptakas engaged fight with Arjuna. Arjuna began to sweep the armies. Arjuna used his Nagastra. Then Partha slew them with his straight arrows. Indeed, all these warriors in that battle, aiming at whom Partha had invoked that foot-tying weapon, had their lower limbs encircled with snakes. Then Susharma countered with his Sauparna astra. Thereupon numerous birds began to come down and devour those snakes.There was no man amongst them that could fight with Arjuna. Arjuna began to destroy all the troops. Beholding that slaughter, all of them remained perfectly inactive, without putting forth their prowess. Arjuna slew all Sampsaptakas and Trigartas. Arjun also killed King Susharma. Arjuna slayed 100,000 warriors. When Arjuna was involved in fight with Samsaptakas, Karna defeated the Pandava brothers Nakula, Sahadeva and Yudhishthira in battle but spared their lives as per promise he made to Kunti. Karna along with his son Vrishasena began slaying armies of Pandavas. Arjuna came into the place where Karna and Vrishasena were creating havocs. Karna was earlier involved in the killing of an unarmed Abhimanyu on the thirteenth day of the battle. First, Karna broke Abhimanyu's bow from behind, since it was impossible to face an armed Abhimanyu and then finally stabbed Abhimanyu along with other warriors. Remembering the injustified death of his son in which both Karna and Vrishasena had major role, Arjuna planned for revenge. Arjuna gave the challenge to Karna to save his son and attacked Vrishasena fiercely and fired four razor headed arrows, cutting off Vrishasena's bow, his two arms and then his head infront of Karna, who failed to protect his son. Karna became inconsolable after seeing his son's fate. He engaged a long duel with Arjuna. The much anticipated battle between Arjuna and Karna took place fiercely. As the battle intensified, Arjuna pushed back Karna's chariot 10 steps backward every time by the energy of the arrows, but Karna failed to push Arjuna's chariot back. When questioned by Arjuna, Krishna said it is meant to be impossible for any human ever to push his chariot backwards because the chariot of Arjuna contains both Hanuman and Krishna, thus holding the entire weight of the universe. Being pushed back by Arjuna, Karna began coming forward but then Karna's chariot wheel was trapped in the mud as a result of the curse he had received earlier from goddess Earth. At the crucial moment, he forgot the incantations to invoke Brahmastra, as a result of his guru Parashurama's curse. Karna got down from his chariot to free the wheel and asked Arjuna to pause, reminding him of the etiquette of war. But Krishna spurred Arjuna to attack Karna reminding the way Karna killed Abhimanyu by stabbing him from behind- which are against the rules of engagement of the war. Being spurred by Krishna, then Arjuna used Anjalikastra to kill Karna which cut the head of Karna, leading to his death. Arjuna had to kill Karna in such a kind of situations only because Karna had banes from Godess Earth and poor brahmin. Earth Godess cursed Karna that his chariot wheel gets struck in land which will lead to his death and a brahmin cursed Karna that Karna would die when he is weaponless as Karna killed his cow when it was helpless. In order to fulfill curses, Krishna spurred Arjuna to kill Karna in that situation Johann Becker, Mahabharata, in Deutsche, Berlin, Germany, pages 130-147 English translations Karna was the third commander-in-chief of Kauravas during the Kurukshetra War. Shown above is his coronation ceremony. Karna Parva was composed in Sanskrit. Several translations of the book in English are available. Two translations from the 19th century, now in public domain, are those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.

Its competitor, Fruit of the Loom, manufactured the gender-specific Funpals (for boys) and FunGals (for girls) brands. The reasoning behind the brand segregation is for marketing purposes (for gender identity purposes). Summary Each individual undergarment started out as a pair of either plain white briefs or plain white panties until the desired prints are added in the manufacturing process. Differences found between the male and female undergarments included the fly in the boys' underwear (for easier urination) and the feminine waistband in the girls' underwear (emulating that of women's full cut panties). The softness of the cotton fabric used could have also determined whether the undergarment was to be worn by a male child or a female child when outside of its original packaging box. Examples of Saturday morning cartoons and movie characters that appeared on a pair of Showtoons underwear included Tinkerbell, Blue's Clues, and the PBS Kids GO! television show Arthur. Characters that were considered to be \\"retro\\" and \\"vintage\\" on Showtoons underwear (and no longer sold in most retail stores) included The Smurfs, Jonny Quest, and TaleSpin. The word \\"showtoons\\" was considered to be a pun on the phrase show tunes (which happened to be music played at Broadway musicals) and a portmanteau of the words \\"show business\\" and \\"cartoons.\\" The Showtoons name by itself does not determine whether the product was suitable for boys or girls. Girls' underwear were always packaged as panties; the equivalent for juvenile males were always packaged as briefs. Unlike Funpals which had a large cartoon graphic at the center of the undergarment, Showtoons uses a small but plentiful amount of cartoon graphics throughout the undergarment. In the Americas, Showtoons were made in either El Salvador or Honduras in manufacturing plants similar to adult underwear.

One Jewish tradition also places the burial site of Talmudic scholar Nachum Ish Gamzu on the main road as one approaches Farradiyya, where was once seen a large edifice made of hewn stones.Levi-Nahum, Yehuda (ed.), Sefer ·π£ohar le-·∏•asifat ginzei teiman (◊°◊§◊® ◊¶◊î◊® ◊ú◊ó◊©◊ô◊§◊™ ◊í◊†◊ñ◊ô ◊™◊ô◊û◊ü), Tel-Aviv 1986, s.v. chapter: Tombs of the forefathers and righteous [3], p. 252 (Hebrew) Under the Abbasid Caliphate, al-Farradiyya was a part of Jund al-Urdunn (\\"Province of Jordan\\").al-Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.39. In 985 CE, Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi describes it as a large village between Acre and Tiberias, with a mosque for Friday sermons. He added that water was plentiful, the surrounding country was pleasant, and there were abundant grapes and vineyards in the village.al-Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.439. =Ottoman era= Farradiyya was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, after being ruled by Crusaders, Ayyubids, and the Mamluks. By the 1596 tax record, it was a part of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jira, part of the Safad Sanjak. The village consisted of 40 households and 3 bachelors, an estimated 237 persons; all Muslims. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, fruits, beehives, goats, and pastures; a total of 5,200 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 177. Partially quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.449, and in Petersen, 2001, p. 139Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as \\"Farod\\".Karmon, 1960, p. 166 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin noted the spring, A√Øn Ferradheh, which had formerly driven several mills, but were now destroyed. He found the village to have about 150 Muslim inhabitants. In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as being built of stone and with the inhabitants growing olives, figs, and tilling small gardens.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 203. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.449. The population was still estimated to be about 150. Springs from Mount al-Jarmaq to the north provided most of the village's water supply, and a boys' elementary school was established during this period. A population list from about 1887 showed that Farradiyya had about 455 Muslim inhabitants.Schumacher, 1888, p. 174 =British Mandate era= After the British took over Palestine from the Ottomans in 1917, Farradiyya became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922. Under the Mandate, it had a thriving agriculture sector, and was known for its model experimental farm which covered 300 dunams of land. The farm was established to improve the variety of apples, apricots, almonds, figs, grapes, pears, and to develop new seed varieties. It had an arboretum where 2,000 plants were grown and distributed to local fellahin, and the farm provided advice services to teach farmers from the Acre and Safad districts how to raise poultry and beehives. Apart from the farm, there were several water-powered mills in the vicinity of Farradiyya. The village was also the site of a shrine for a local religious leader named Shaykh Mansur. A report from the village (before 1933) noted the Maqam (shrine) for Sheik Mansur as \\"a square building with arch and niche.\\" The report also noted that there was a medieval arch in the cemetery.Petersen, 2001, p. 139 In the 1922 census of Palestine, the village had 362 Muslim residents,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 rising to 465 in the 1931 census; 464 Muslims and 1 Christian, in a total of 101 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 106 Farradiya, winter 2019 The village was visited in 1933 by a representative from the Department of Antiquities, who reported that \\"A maqam known locally by the name of \\"Sheikh Man·π£ur\\" is standing in the main track leading to the village at a point about halfway between the village itself and the Govt. School for boys. It is a square room in a ruinous condition about 4m x 4m. The only part which is still to be seen in position is the northern wall -it consists of nine courses above the basement with an average of 27 cm height; each course; making a total of 2.45 m high. The N.E. corner as well as the middle of the wall have worn pilasters with 1/2 inch projections. The bases and capitals have simple mouldings. The top most course is made of moulded stones forming a cornice.\\"PAM Makhouly 11.2.33/ ATQ 676. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 139 The shrine of \\"Sheikh Man·π£ur\\" is thought to be that of Rabbi Tan·∏•um of Parod. (Hebrew) The British built here a fortified police station. In the 1945 statistics the population was 670 Muslims, with a total of 19,747 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,182 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 4,137 for cereals;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 118 while a total of 25 dunams was built-up, or urban, area.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 169 =1948 War and aftermath= Farradiyya was captured by Israel's Golani Brigade in Operation Hiram on October 30, 1948. It was not directly assaulted, but as the brigade advanced north from the Arab town of Eilabun in the south towards Sa'sa' in the north, Farradiyya was surrounded by Israeli forces on all sides. Prior to its capture, in early May, Arabs from Akbara and az-Zahiriyya took refuge in the village. Because it was not assaulted, many of Farradiyya's residents remained in the village until February 1949. It was on December 15, 1948, that Israeli authorities decided to expel the remaining 261 inhabitants, but the plan was executed in February. Israeli forces evicted most of the villagers to other Arab villages in the Galilee under their control or to the northern West Bank. In 1949, the Jewish village of Parod was founded on village lands, east of the village site, and in 1950, the village of Shefer was established on Farradiyya's northern lands. In 1992 the village site was described: > The site is deserted and covered with wild thorns, trees, and piles of > stones from the destroyed homes. Cactuses grow on the land around the site, > which is mostly utilized for grazing animals.Khalidi, 1992, p.450. =Archaeological finds= Excavations conducted at the site in 1996 have revealed columbaria and burial caves (kokhim) dating back to the Early‚ÄìLate Roman and Early Byzantine periods. Ceramics have also been found here from the Byzantine era.Dauphin, 1998, p. 705 In 2010, a survey of the site was conducted by Cinamon Gilad and Baron Hendrik on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # A-5822 See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Gallery File:Farradiyya.jpgAbandoned house in Farradiyya File:Ancient walled structure in Parod - Farradiyya.jpgRemains of ancient wall in Farradiyya File:Broken wall at Parod - Farradiyya.jpgBroken wall File:Ancient wall of Parod - Farradiyya.jpgAncient walled structure in Farradiyya File:Old wall in Farradiyya - Parod.jpgOld wall File:Farradiyya - Parod.jpgRuined house in Farradiyya File:House in Farradiyya with Kh.

Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559 (2d. Cir. 2009), was a lawsuit brought by Maher Arar against the United States and various U.S. officials pursuant to the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA),. and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismissed Arar's complaint due to lack of personal jurisdiction and national security and foreign policy considerations. This ruling was ultimately upheld by a divided en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Background  Maher Arar was a Canadian citizen who was deported to Syria by the U.S. government. In Syria, he was tortured, forced to falsely confess, and released after one year without being charged. Arar sought a declaratory judgment that defendants' conduct violated his \\"constitutional, civil, and international human rights,\\" as well as compensatory and punitive damages for the statutory and constitutional violations.Arar v. Ashcroft et al. (2nd Cir), 06-4216-cv, at pg. 5  Case  In January 2004, Arar announced that he would be suing then-American Attorney- General John Ashcroft over his treatment. The Center for Constitutional Rights brought the suit Arar v. Ashcroft against former Attorney General John Ashcroft, then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, and then-Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, as well as numerous U.S. immigration officials including Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James W. Ziglar. It charged the defendants violated Arar's constitutional right to due process; his right to choose a country of removal other than one in which he would be tortured, as guaranteed under the Torture Victims Protection Act; and his rights under international law.http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current- cases/arar-v.-ashcroft The suit charged that Arar's Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated when he was confined without access to an attorney or the court system, both domestically before being rendered, and while detained by the Syrian government, whose actions were complicit with the U.S. Additionally, the Attorney General and INS officials who carried out his deportation also likely violated his right to due process by recklessly subjecting him to torture at the hands of a foreign government that they had every reason to believe would carry out abusive interrogation. Further, Arar filed a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1992, which allows a victim of torture by an individual of a foreign government to bring suit against that actor in U.S. Court. Arar's claim under the Act against Ashcroft and the INS directors was based upon their complicity in bringing about the torture he suffered. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In its denial of Arar's petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court upheld the 2nd Circuit's en banc dismissal the case against the named defendants.  Timeline  January 22, 2004 ‚Äì The case was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. January 18, 2005 ‚Äì The U.S. government moved to dismiss the case by asserting the \\"state secrets\\" privilege. The government claimed that the reason Arar was deemed a member of Al Qaeda and sent to Syria, instead of Canada, are \\"state secrets.\\" February 16, 2006 ‚Äì Judge David G. Trager issued a memorandum and order dismissing the TVPA, torture, and detention claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Fifth Amendment claim for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants. Judge Trager found that national security and foreign policy considerations prevented him from holding the officials liable for carrying out an extraordinary rendition even if such conduct violates our treaty obligations or customary international law. September 12, 2006 ‚Äì Arar filed a Notice of Appeal in the Second Circuit. December 12, 2006 ‚Äì Attorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights filed an appeal in the Second Circuit on behalf of Arar. November 9, 2007 ‚Äì The appeal was argued before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. June 30, 2008 ‚Äì The majority opinion found that adjudicating Arar's claims would interfere with national security and foreign policy and that as a foreigner who had not been formally admitted to the U.S., Arar had no constitutional due process rights with respect to the government's interference with his access to a lawyer. This was decided by a three judge panel by a 2-1 vote. The court reversed the district court and ruled Arar had shown a prima facie showing sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over Thompson, Ashcroft, and Mueller, but upheld the dismissal on its merits. August 12, 2008 ‚Äì The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sua sponte issued an order that the case would be reheard en banc. December 9, 2008 ‚Äì En banc hearing was held. November 2, 2009 - The 2nd Circuit United States Court of Appeals, in a 7-4 decision, upheld the ruling by the district court.

P. Putnam's Sons, 1883. The Diothas has been called \\"perhaps the second most important American nineteenth-century ideal society\\"Everett F. Bleiler with Richard Bleiler, Science-Fiction: The Early Years, Kent, OH, Kent University Press, 1990; p. 735. after Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888). Synopsis The novel begins with a scene in which the first-person narrator undergoes an episode of \\"mesmerism,\\" or hypnosis, and wakes up in the far future; he has suddenly passed \\"from the nineteenth to the ninety-sixth century....\\"The Diothas, p. 3. In the company of a friend and guide named Utis Estai, the narrator begins to learn the nature of this future world. He is introduced to the massive city of \\"Nuiorc,\\" the future development of New York City; and he travels with his guide to Utis's home in the suburbs. He learns from Utis and others about the structure and institutions of this future society. =The social and technological= The book concentrates most of its attention on the social and technological advances of the ninety-sixth century; and some of Macnie's forecasts and predictions are notably prescient. The one most often cited in criticism and commentaryNorthrop Frye, \\"Varieties of Literary Utopias,\\" Daedalus, Vol. 94 No. 2 (Spring 1965), pp. 323-47; see pp. 328-9.Frank E. Manuel, ed., Utopias and Utopian Thought, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1966; pp. 30-1.Edwin Warner, \\"Voyage to Utopia in the Year 1971,\\" Time Magazine, Monday, January 18, 1971. is Macnie's prediction that the paved roads of the future will have white lines running down their centers to divide the traffic flow.The Diothas, p. 45. Macnie also forecasts advances in communication, with a global telephone network, and recorded lectures by college professors, among other developments that have come to pass in the ensuing centuries. Some of Macnie's anticipations are more characteristic of the early twenty-first century, like electric cars, and rooftop gardens on public and private buildings (a feature of the modern \\"green building\\" movement). At one point in The Diothas, the narrator meets an elderly astronomer who has developed a \\"calculating machine\\" that can draw geometric figures, and can also begin with a geometric curve and then display the formula it representsThe Diothas, pp. 141-3.--tasks done by modern computers and computer graphics. Macnie's future has progressive, egalitarian, and semi-socialist elements. The sexes have fairly similar rights (though only males have to perform a type of national service). Some gender roles persist; all men are given some training in law, and all women in medicine. The majority of scientists are male, the majority of artists are female. Yet women inventors have been primarily responsible for the development of varzeo and lizeo (\\"far-seeing\\" and \\"live-seeing\\")--that is, television and motion pictures.The Diothas, pp. 173-6, 309-10. Women do domestic laundry and cooking--but communally. The average work day is three hours long; people devote their abundant leisure time to the arts and sciences and to further education. A form of capitalism exists, though there are limits on inherited wealth. Workers in business enterprises are often shareholders also. Macnie does envision a significant element of Puritanism in his future society, with Prohibition of alcohol and laws against marital infidelity. The author's conservative opinions are partly represented by his future. He condemns the authors Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens as \\"maudlin sympathizers with crime....\\"The Diothas, p. 112. He even includes in his future the old Roman practice in which \\"the father had unquestioned power of life and death over his children.\\"The Diothas, p. 205. =The personal= There are personal aspects to the novel as well: the narrator meets and becomes enamored of a young woman named Reva Diotha. (She and her female relatives are \\"the Diothas\\" of the title). Cleverly, Macnie complicates the frame of his narrative: the narrator is, in his own perception, a time-traveller from the nineteenth century--but he is known by the other characters as a friend and relative named Ismar Thiusen who has developed a mental illness, and who has the delusion that he is a time-traveller from the nineteenth century. (The narrator arrives in the 96th century able to speak its altered English language, in which the name of West Point has devolved into \\"Uespa,\\" St. Louis into \\"Salu,\\" and Buffalo into \\"Falo.\\") Utis treats Thiusen rather like a psychiatric patient; Utis humors his friend's delusion and explains the features of their world, as a kind of therapy meant to restore Thiusen to his proper wits. Once Thiusen and Reva Diotha are matched as a couple, they interpret his situation in terms of reincarnation. In the end, however, Thiusen returns to the nineteenth century, after an accidental plunge over Niagara Falls. There, he is united with Edith Alston, the woman he loves. The Diothas and Looking Backward It has long been recognized that a relationship exists between Macnie's Diothas and Bellamy's Looking Backward.Arthur E. Morgan, Edward Bellamy, New York, Columbia University Press, 1944.Robert L. Schurter, The Utopian Novel in America, 1865-1900, New York, AMS Press, 1975. Both books send their first-person protagonists to the future via hypnotism; both protagonists were, in their own time, enamored of a woman named Edith; and each becomes enamored of a future descendant of his Edith. Both novels predict similar technological developments. Macnie and Bellamy are known to have corresponded about their ideas prior to the publication of their books. In the concluding chapter of The Diothas, Edward Bellamy is the figure identified as \\"E‚Äî.\\"The Diothas, pp. 352-8. Macnie himself believed that Bellamy had introduced too many elements of The Diothas into his later book.\\"Ismar Thiusen,\\" Looking Forward, or The Diothas, New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1890; p. iii.Geoffrey N. Cantor et al., Science in the Nineteenth Century Periodical, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; pp. 238, 296. Once Looking Backward proved a great best-seller after its 1888 publication, Macnie and his publisher released a second edition of their 1883 book, re-titling it Looking Forward; or, The Diothas (1890). Unfortunately, Macnie was then criticized for \\"plagiarizing\\" Bellamy's better- known work. Macnie's book tended to be confused among the many sequels and responses to Looking Backward.Sylvia E. Bowman, Edward Bellamy Abroad: An American Prophet's Influence, New York, Twayne, 1962; p. 266. There is an obvious and major difference between the two works. Bellamy set his story in the near future, and suggested a program for realizing the changes he predicted and advocated. Macnie's plot is set so many \\"chiliads\\" in the future that no program for achieving his utopia could seem feasible.See also Byron A. Brooks's Earth Revisited for another utopian novel influenced by Macnie's book. The Diothas and The Great Romance The relationship between The Diothas and Looking Backward is complicated by another prior work, The Great Romance (1881). This science-fiction novella was printed anonymously in New Zealand, and is extremely rare; it now exists only in a single copy in a library in Wellington. Yet despite the obscurity of The Great Romance, Macnie may have known of it; he makes his hero in The Diothas a native of \\"Maoria,\\" the New Zealand of his future.The Diothas, p. 58. All three of these stories share common features.Dominic Alessio, ed., \\"The Great Romance, by The Inhabitant,\\" Science Fiction Studies No. 61, Vol. 20 Part 3 (November 1993), pp. 305-40. The author John Macnie (1836-1909) was born in Scotland, and educated at the University of Glasgow; he received an honorary M.A. degree from Yale University in 1874. He was a professor at the University of North Dakota for two decades; he was hired as professor of English, French, and German in 1886, and retired as professor of French and Spanish languages and literature during 1906. The University of North Dakota's Macnie Hall was named after him. Macnie published A Treatise on the Theory and Solution of Algebraic Equations in 1876, and Elements of Geometry, Plain and Solid in 1895.

Description and career Ahmad Shah was from the Kuz Kunar District of Nangarhar Province. His full name was \\"Ahmad Shah Dara-I-Nur\\" meaning \\"Ahmad Shah of the Valley of the Enlightened Ones\\". Shah reportedly fought against the Taliban and al Qaeda in 2001. He eventually switched sides and later became a facilitator for foreign fighters traversing and operating in the challenging terrain of the northeast. He was most closely associated with Gulbadin Hekmatyar. He led a small armed group of Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) fighters who ambushed a team of four U.S. Navy SEALs and then shot down an CH-47 helicopter dispatched as part of a quick reaction force for the SEALs, killing a total of 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings in late June 2005. In the fire fight with the four SEALs his group had an estimated 35 casualties as a result of a last stand by the four SEALs. The Marine Battalion that conceived and planned Operation Red Wings, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment developed the operation to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the Pech District of the Kunar Province with a focus on Shah. Through human intelligence and signals intelligence they determined Ahmad Shah had a force of 10 to 20 fighters. Shah and the fighters under his command exacted heavy casualties to the Navy SEALs and Marines. Subsequent to the SEAL ambush and CH-47 shootdown, Shah and his men escaped to Pakistan, where they produced a video from footage they shot of the ambush that included weapons and implements captured from the SEALs. In late July 2005, Shah and his men returned to the Kunar Province, and began attacking United States, Coalition, and Government of Afghanistan entities. Ahmad Shah's cell was destroyed during Operation Whalers, which was planned and conducted by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment. Operation Whalers, like Operation Red Wings, was planned to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia activity in the region to further support ongoing stabilization efforts to ensure a safe voting environment for the 18 September 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. After Operation Whalers, Shah was unable to stage attacks in Afghanistan again. Shah was killed during a shootout with Pakistan Armed Forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in April 2008, after failing to stop at a security checkpoint whilst transporting a kidnapped trader.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/infamous-taliban-leader-killed- in-pakistan/ An official from Kunar Province stated that Shah had been the \\"most wanted terrorist in Kunar province.\\"  References   Bibliography  * 2008 deaths Afghan Islamists Deaths by firearm in Pakistan Place of birth unknown Date of birth unknown Taliban leaders Pashtun people ","title":"Ahmad Shah (Taliban)"},{"id":"20621564","text":"The Great Sierra Mine Historic Site preserves the site of the largest mining operation in what would become Yosemite National Park. The mine was located on Tioga Hill on the crest and eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, one of several claims intended to work the Sheepherder silver lode. The Sheepherder lode was discovered in 1860, and rediscovered by shepherd Thomas Brusky, Jr., who staked a number of claims in the area. In 1881 all of the claims were bought out by the Great Sierra Consolidated Silver Mining Company and established the company town of Dana. Due to the 11,000 foot altitude the town was soon relocated to the bottom of the hill at Bennettville. After an adit was driven 1784 feet into the side of the hill at an expenditure of $300,000, operations were closed down in 1884. They resumed with modern equipment in 1933, but did not find the Sheepherder Lode, and operations ceased for good. Today, five stone cabins, a powder house and a blacksmith shop remain.

It stars Nonso Anozie as Cass Pennant and is directed by Jon S. Baird. Plot Cass is based on the true story of the life of Cass Pennant, adapted from his book. The film tells of how he was adopted by an elderly white couple in 1958 and brought up in Slade Green, an all-white area of London. Cass is forced to endure racist bullying on a daily basis from local children, who also ridicule his feminine-sounding name, \\"Carol\\", a name given to him at birth. Cass finds through violence the respect he never had and becomes addicted to the buzz of fighting. Cass leads the Inter City Firm to victories against large hooligan firms, such as Leeds in 1980, but becomes frustrated with the lack of publicity the ICF are receiving. So he creates cards with the infamous slogan, \\"Congratulations, you have just met the famous ICF\\", and gives a TV interview, increasing the firm's notoriety for humiliation, their speciality. However, the government under Margaret Thatcher begins to come down hard on hooliganism, and after an organised attack on a group of Newcastle United supporters, Cass is imprisoned for four years. Whilst in Wormwood Scrubs, Cass begins writing his autobiography, in the hope he can generate some income upon the book being published; however his writings are confiscated by the prison upon his release. Cass is delighted to receive a hero's welcome upon his return, and begins dating Elaine (Natalie Press). This, as well as Cass's rejection of his biological parents after their attempts to contact him, improves his relationship with his adoptive parents after they began to disapprove of his violent lifestyle. Despite having a good relationship with Elaine, Cass is still lured to the violence of hooliganism, and when one of his best friends, Prentice (Gavin Brocker), is attacked by Arsenal supporters with knives, Cass seeks revenge. He is stabbed in the following fight, and Elaine is disgusted, fearing he is returning to his old ways, as she reveals she is pregnant with his child. As time progresses to the early 1990s, the ecstasy era takes over, and hooliganism becomes less of an attraction for Cass, and for many other hooligan firms. By 1992, he has settled down in Penge, South London, with his young son and Elaine, who is pregnant again. Cass gets a job as a bouncer outside nightclubs, working for Ray (Tamer Hassan), a long-time friend from his ICF days. However one evening, just after starting a shift at the nightclub, Cass is shot three times by the group of Arsenal supporters that he feuded with back in the 1980s. Cass survives, but wakes up to hear the tragic news that his mother has died. In the following weeks, Cass is haunted by his demons after the shooting; he sees visions of his attacker, he can't sleep and on one occasion, makes a violent outburst at his son. Cass's friend Ray has tracked down his attackers and offers Cass the opportunity to kill them. Cass is taken to a pub and holds a gun to his attacker's head at point-blank range, but decides not to pull the trigger. The film ends as Cass walks away from the pub and into the distance. Pennant himself plays a cameo role in the movie as the character \\"Biggs\\", who is one of the bouncers.

It is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol benzoate is used in veterinary medicine as well. When used clinically, the medication is given by injection into muscle usually two to three times per week. Side effects of estradiol benzoate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol benzoate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol benzoate was discovered in 1933 and was introduced for medical use that same year. It was the first estradiol ester to be discovered or marketed, and was one of the first estrogens to be used in medicine. Along with estradiol dipropionate, estradiol benzoate was among the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years following its introduction. However, in the 1950s, longer-acting estradiol esters that necessitated less frequent injections, such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate, were developed, and have since largely superseded estradiol benzoate. Nonetheless, estradiol benzoate remains widely available throughout the world. It is not available for medical use in the United States, but is available in this country for use in veterinary medicine. Medical uses The medical uses of estradiol benzoate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Estradiol benzoate is used in hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty due to hypogonadism or other causes in women. It is also used in hormone therapy for transgender women. Aside from hormone therapy, estradiol benzoate is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and breast engorgement. In addition, it is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol benzoate has a relatively short duration of action, and is administered by intramuscular injection usually two to three times per week. It is used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms at a dosage of 1 to 1.66 mg initially and 0.33 to 1 mg for maintenance two times per week, and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty at a dosage of 1.66 mg two to three times per week. The dosage used in hormone therapy for transgender women is 0.5 to 1.5 mg two to three times per week. In the treatment of prostate cancer, estradiol benzoate is used at a dosage of 1.66 mg three times per week (for a total of 5 mg per week). =Available forms= Estradiol benzoate is and has been available as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided as vials and ampoules at concentrations of 0.167, 0.2, 0.33, 1, 1.67, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 25 mg/mL. It is also available as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection under the brand name Agofollin Depot.https://web.archive.org/web/20190519104654/http://www.sukl.cz/download/pil/PI16221.pdf Sistocyclin was the brand name of a product containing 10 mg microcrystalline estradiol benzoate and 200 mg microcrystalline progesterone in an aqueous suspension. Follivirin (and previously Femandren M) is the brand name of a product containing 2.5 mg microcrystalline estradiol benzoate and 25 to 50 mg microcrystalline testosterone isobutyrate in aqueous suspension. A vaginal tablet formulation containing 0.125 mg estradiol benzoate and 10 mg monalazone sodium (a vaginal disinfectant and spermicidal contraceptive) has been marketed under the brand name Malun 25. Estradiol benzoate was also formerly available as 50 and 100 mg pellets for subcutaneous implantation and as a 2 mg/g ointment. Contraindications Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. Side effects The side effects of estradiol benzoate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. Overdose Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. Interactions Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. Pharmacology Estradiol, the active form of estradiol benzoate. =Pharmacodynamics= Estradiol benzoate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol benzoate has very low affinity for the ERs, on the order of 100-fold less than that of estradiol. As such, estradiol benzoate is regarded as essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol. Estradiol benzoate is of about 38% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 benzoate ester. Because estradiol benzoate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estrogenic potency In the case of intramuscular injections of either estradiol benzoate or estradiol valerate in oil solution, the maturation dosage for the vaginal epithelium is 5 to 7 mg once per week and the endometrial proliferation dosage is 7 to 10 mg once per week. The total endometrial proliferation dosage of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection over 14 days is 25 to 35 mg. The full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in oil solution is 1 to 2 mg estradiol benzoate and 20 to 25 mg progesterone by intramuscular injection daily for 10 to 14 days, whereas the full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 mg progesterone. For comparison, the full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution (brand name Gravibinon) is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol valerate and 250 to 375 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Endometrial transformation normally occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; it is induced by endogenous progesterone following adequate priming by endogenous estradiol. The decidua (pregnancy-type endometrium) induction dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in oil solution is 2 to 5 mg estradiol benzoate and 20 to 100 mg progesterone by intramuscular injection daily for 5 to 7 weeks, whereas the decidua induction dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is 10 to 20 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 to 250 mg progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection once per week for about 6 weeks. For comparison, the decidua induction dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution is about the same as that of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate/progesterone in aqueous suspension. The decidua induction dosages of estrogen and progestogen combinations are pseudopregnancy dosages. =Pharmacokinetics= Following administration, estradiol benzoate acts as a prodrug of estradiol via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid benzoic acid. This cleavage occurs not only in the liver, but also in the blood and in tissues. Esters of estradiol like estradiol benzoate are readily hydrolyzed to estradiol, but have an extended duration when administered in via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection due to a depot effect afforded by their fatty acid ester moiety and consequent high lipophilicity. A long-lasting local tissue depot is formed by the injection that slowly releases estradiol benzoate into the circulation. Intramuscular injection =Oil solution= The duration of action of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection at typical clinical doses (e.g., 0.33‚Äì1.66 mg) is said to be 2 to 3 days. A single dose of 2.5 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection was found to produce plasma estradiol levels of greater than 400 pg/mL, measured 24 hours post-injection, in a group of patients with minimal baseline levels of estradiol (due to GnRH analogue therapy with triptorelin). The elimination half-life of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection has been reported to be 48 to 120 hours (2 to 5 days). A single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution has been found to result in peak circulating concentrations of 940 pg/mL estradiol and 343 pg/mL estrone, which occurred at about 2 days post-injection. Compared to two other commonly used estradiol esters, estradiol benzoate had the shortest duration, at approximately 4 to 5 days, whereas estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate were found to last for 7 to 8 days and 11 days, respectively. This is because estradiol benzoate has a shorter and less bulky fatty acid chain, and in relation to this, is comparatively less lipophilic. For a given estradiol ester, the shorter or less bulky the fatty acid chain is, the less lipophilic, shorter-lasting, and less uniform/plateau-like the resultant levels of estradiol are as well as the higher (and hence more spike-like) the peak/maximal levels are. Daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution have been found to produce estradiol excretion rates almost double those of the normal luteal phase. This is in accordance with known production rates of estradiol in women (e.g., 300 ¬µg/day in the luteal phase). =Aqueous suspension= Microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension (brand names Agofollin Depot and Ovocyclin M alone and Follivirin in combination with testosterone isobutyrate) has been found to have a longer duration of action than amorphous estradiol benzoate in oil solution when administered via intramuscular injection. Whereas the duration of a single intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate in oil solution is 6 days, the duration of a single intramuscular injection of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension is 16 to 21 days. Its duration also surpasses that of estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate. The duration of microcrystalline aqueous suspensions administered by intramuscular injection is dependent both on concentration and on crystal size. Other routes The duration of estradiol benzoate is not prolonged if it is administered directly into the circulation via intravenous injection, in contrast to intramuscular injection. Estradiol benzoate is active with oral and sublingual administration, similarly to estradiol valerate and estradiol acetate. However, it is not marketed in any formulation for use by these routes. Oral estradiol benzoate has been reported to possess about one-third to half the potency of intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate. This level of oral potency has been described as remarkably high. The sublingual potency of estradiol benzoate is similar to that of estradiol. A study found that the total dose of estradiol benzoate needed for endometrial proliferation in women was 60 to 140 mg, relative to 60 to 180 mg for estradiol. Both estradiol and estradiol benzoate has a persistence of estrogenic effect with single administration of one day. Subcutaneous implantation of crystalline estradiol benzoate pellets has been studied, but no estradiol benzoate pellet implants have been marketed. Chemistry Estradiol benzoate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C3 benzoate (benzenecarboxylate) ester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 3-benzoate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Œ≤-diol 3-benzoate. Two estradiol esters that are related to estradiol benzoate are estradiol dipropionate, the C3,17Œ≤ dipropionate ester of estradiol, and estradiol acetate, the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol benzoate is 4.7.http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.193412.html History Estradiol benzoate was one of the first estrogens to be developed and marketed. In 1932, Adolf Butenandt described estrone benzoate and reported that it had a prolonged duration of action. Schwenk and Hildebrant at Schering discovered estradiol via reduction of estrone in 1933, and they proceeded to synthesize estradiol benzoate from estradiol the same year. Estradiol benzoate was patented by Schering in 1933 and was introduced in an oil solution for use by intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon B that year as well. By 1936, multiple formulations of estradiol benzoate in oil solution had been marketed, including under the brand names Progynon B by Schering, Dimenformon Benzoate by Roche-Organon, and Oestroform B by British Drug Houses. By the early 1940s, Ben-Ovocylin had been introduced by Ciba as well. In the late 1940s, the brand name Ben-Ovocylin was changed by Ciba to Ovocylin Benzoate. Following their introduction, estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate were the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years. However, estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate, which are longer-acting esters that require less frequent administration, were developed and introduced in the 1950s, and have since largely superseded estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate.
