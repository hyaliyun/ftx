She is Professor Emeritus at the University of Melbourne. Anderson has been Herald Chair of Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne from 1997 until 2014, and was President of International Committee of the History of Art (Comit√© International d'Histoire de l'Art, CIHA) from 2008 to 2012. Biography Jaynie Anderson was born in Melbourne, the daughter of Keith Anderson, a medical practitioner, and of Bonnie Surridge, a pianist. Her schooling took place at St Michael‚Äôs Grammar School, St Kilda, and at the Melbourne Church of England Girls Grammar School. Her portrait, aged 18 by Reshid Bey, is in the National Portrait Gallery (Australia), Canberra. Academic career Anderson has had a long career both internationally and within Australia. At the University of Melbourne she studied History and Fine Arts (BA Hons I, 1962-1966). In 1967 Charles Mitchell, invited her to Bryn Mawr College, Philadelphia, to begin work on a doctoral dissertation on Venetian Renaissance painting. In 1970 she was elected the first woman Rhodes Fellow at St Hugh‚Äôs College, Oxford, at a period when Rhodes Scholarships were unavailable to women. There she competed her doctorate on Giorgione, and remained as a lecturer in art history at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, from 1975 to 1996. In 1997 Jaynie Anderson was appointed Herald Chair of Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne, a post she held until 2014.

She engaged in many research projects, but most notably the convening of the international congress in art history at the University of Melbourne in January 2008, Crossing Cultures. Conflict, Migration and Convergence, a theme of Australian significance that has become increasingly one of international importance. The conference was published the following year with contributions from 220 authors. Described as the biennale of art history, the participants investigate the state of the discipline across the world. Contemporary Indigenous Australian art proudly took its place as part of the international discourse on art history. Hans Belting described the conference as having ‚Äòchanged the history of art history forever‚Äô. In 2008 Anderson was elected president of the International Committee of the History of Art (Comit√© International d'Histoire de l'Art, CIHA), in which role she developed global art history until 2012. The composition of the board of CIHA was changed to represent all continents.

Singer-songwriter Sarah Lynn provided vocals on the track as well as co-wrote it. The pair have performed the song live in support of other acts such as Fatboy Slim, during the artist's visits to Belfast. After first receiving popularity on U.K.-related music channels such as BBC Radio 1 and Cool FM, label Nervous Records stated that it sought to promote the track in the U.S. The single received commercial success in the U.S., reaching the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart. The song spent eighteen weeks on the chart in total. DJ Mog background Referred to by the BBC Radio 1 Judge Jules program as an \\"Irish up & comer\\", he began playing electronic dance music in local events in his hometown of Belfast during the early 1990s. He entered and won a few local DJing competitions before taking more interest into the studio and production side of things. Sarah Lynn background One of a pair of identical twins, Lynn grew up in the Killinchy area but later moved to Belfast. Though strongly interested in music, particularly listening to songs by Radiohead and Foo Fighters, she has stated that struggles with clinical depression and related afflictions such as bipolar disorder have dogged her for years. Though Lynn felt forced to drop out of her degree course in textile art at the University of Ulster School of Art, she took up singing, writing songs, and playing guitar as well as working as a volunteer for charity events. She has remarked, \\"I take lithium which makes my mood more consistent. It does away with the peaks and troughs but it also leaves a bit of emotional numbness.\\" She has also stated that the \\"last thing I want is for my condition to be a barrier that keeps me back\\" and she feels optimistic given the popularity of the \\"Somewhere\\" single. Album releases A version of the track was included in the compilation album The New Dance Mix USA: In the Club alongside other dance-oriented releases such as \\"Sofi Needs a Ladder\\" by Deadmau5 and \\"Barbra Streisand\\" by Duck Sauce. Mixed by artist Ted the Dillinger, the album came out on 15 March 2011. Praised by an Allmusic review as a \\"diverse set of populist dance music\\", the album reached the No. 8 spot on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums chart and No. 19 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

History Build UK was launched on 1 September 2015, following the merger of the UKCG and the NSCC. Its initial action plan has five key areas: the image of construction, industry‚Äôs skills needs, effective pre-qualification, health and safety performance, and fair payment practices. Following Carillion's January 2018 liquidation, Build UK set out an agenda to reform the construction industry's commercial model, potentially eliminating unfair contract terms, late payment and retentions. =UKCG= Established in January 2009, the UKCG succeeded the Major Contractors Group and the National Contractors Federation which had until that point represented the views of the leading UK contractors. The UKCG represented over 30 contractors operating in the UK. Between them (c. 2015), UKCG members accounted for ¬£33 billion of construction turnover - a third of UK construction total output. It was one of two organisations which represented the views of contractors on the Strategic Forum for Construction, along with the Construction Alliance. UKCG also worked closely with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Construction Council. =NSCC= The National Specialist Contractors' Council comprised 32 specialist trade associations representing companies involved in planning, design, construction, refurbishment and maintenance of the built environment. The NSCC represented these specialist trade organisations on the Strategic Forum for Construction, alongside the Specialist Engineering Contractors Group. It was a member of the Joint Contracts Tribunal. Membership Build UK has four categories of membership: Alliance, Clients, Contractors and Trade Associations.

This polysaccharide secretion of root exudate forms a gelatinous substance that sticks to the caps of roots. Root mucilage is known to play a role in forming relationships with soil-dwelling life forms. Just how this root mucilage is secreted is debated, but there is growing evidence that mucilage derives from ruptured cells. As roots penetrate through the soil, many of the cells surrounding the caps of roots are continually shed and replaced. These ruptured or lysed cells release their component parts, which include the polysaccharides that form root mucilage. These polysaccharides come from the Golgi apparatus and plant cell wall, which are rich in plant- specific polysaccharides. Unlike animal cells, plant cells have a cell wall that acts as a barrier surrounding the cell providing strength, which supports plants just like a skeleton. This cell wall is used to produce everyday products such as timber, paper, and natural fabrics, including cotton. Root mucilage is a part of a wider secrete from plant roots known as root exudate. Plant roots secrete a variety of organic molecules into the surrounding soil, such as proteins, enzymes, DNA, sugars and amino acids, which are the building blocks of life. This collective secretion is known as root exudate. This root exudate prevents root infection from bacteria and fungi, helps the roots to penetrate through the soil, and can create a micro-climate that is beneficial to the plant.  Root mucilage composition  To determine the sugars within root mucilage, monosaccharide analysis and monosaccharide linkage analysis are undertaken. Monosaccharide linkage analysis involves methylating the root mucilage, which contains polysaccharides. The root mucilage is hydrolysed using acid to break down the polysaccharides into their monosaccharide components. The subsistent monosaccharides are then reduced to open their rings. The open ring monosaccharides are then acetylated, and separated typically by using gas chromatography, although liquid chromatography is also used. The masses of the monosaccharides are then detected using mass spectrometry. The gas chromatography retention times and the mass spectrometry chromatogram are used to identify how the monosaccharides are linked to form the polysaccharides that make root mucilage. For monosaccharide analysis, which reveals the sugars that make root mucilage, scientists hydrolyse the root mucilage using acid, and put the samples directly through gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry. Several scientists have determined the composition of plant root mucilage using monosaccharide analysis and linkage analysis, showing that Maize (Zea mays) root mucilage contains high levels of galactose, xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, and glucose, and lower levels of uronic acid, mannose, fucose, and glucuronic acid. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) root mucilage also contains high levels of xylose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, and lower levels of rhamnose, glucuronic acid and mannose. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) also contains high levels of arabinose, galactose, glucose, fucose, and xylose, and lower levels of rhamnose, mannose, and glucuronic acid. Many other plants have had their root mucilage composition determined using monosaccharide analysis and monosaccharide linkage analysis. With the following monosaccharides determined as well as their linkages, scientists have determined the presence of pectin, arabinogalactan proteins, xyloglucan, arabinan, and xylan, which are plant-specific polysaccharides within the root mucilage of plants.  Importance and role of root mucilage  Plants use up to 60% of their energy secreting root mucilage, which they generate from photosynthesis that takes place in the leaves. Root mucilage plays a role in developing a symbiotic relationship with the soil-dwelling fungi. This important relationship is known to affect 94% of land plants, and benefits plants by increasing water and nutrient uptake from the soil, particularly phosphorus. In return, the fungi receive food in the form of carbohydrates from the plant in the form of broken-down root mucilage. Without this relationship, many plants would struggle to gain sufficient water or nutrients. In many forests, mycorrhizae fungi form relationships with most of the plants, and even form connections with other mycorrhizae fungi. This interconnection links small plants to shrubs and trees. This network of plant roots and fungi forms a web of hyphae or root-like branching filaments, and is referred to as the Wood Wide Web. This network of fungi hyphae can shuttle water and nutrients from one part of the forest to another when needed. It can also shuttle carbohydrates throughout the network so that the network is not disrupted by a lack of carbohydrate input. Root mucilage also helps soil to stick to roots. The purpose of this is to maintain the plant's contact with the soil so that the plant can regulate the levels of water it can absorb, decrease friction so that roots can penetrate through the soil, and maintain a micro-climate.

It stretches on the high right bank of the Worskla, between Worskla and Gotnja. Its territory covers . Geographically the area belongs to the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. The nature reserve is bordered to the north-east to the village of Krasny Kutok in the southeast, Borisovka in the north and the south and west by the Worsklatal. On the left bank of the Vorskla, is the village of Dubino (Landsgemeinde Belenkoje). The territory of the forest itself is part of the rural community Kryukovo. The western, northwestern and southern edges form the river terraces and slopes of Woskla and Loknjatal Riverss. The highest point in the forest at is located in the northeastern part of the forest. The lowest point () is located in Worsklatal. Through the forest run numerous small gullies that are called in this region \\"Jar\\". In the forest there are no springs and watercourses although the forest is quite wet at the beginning of spring, after the snow melts, flowing rivulets at the bottom of canyons. The rivers Vorskla, Gotnja and Loknja flow along the forest edge for a distance of . On the territory of the forest there is no natural pond. Only in the protection zone of the nature reserve, in the Worsklatalaue, there are small backwaters. In the 20th century, ponds were built in the Klosterrunse whose dams broke through snow meltwater. Only a pond remained at the top of the gully. The soils of the forest at the Vorskla developed on different parent materials, especially on the loam, which is found in the eastern half of the forest. In the northwestern part of the forest, old alluvium sands play a role. They are distributed on the river terraces of Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge of the forest an oligoz√§nischer sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in the southern part of the forest, a rust-colored clay comes out. The oligoz√§nische sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are the starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the loess. Under the oligoz√§nischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in the territory of the forest. Here 20 different soil types are distinguished. They differ on the degree of podsolisation and the humus content. All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the types of gray forest soils.Stschastnaja L.S.

Forest was used as a natural barrier against depredations of the Tartars. Therefore, logging of the woods was strictly forbidden. At the end of the 17th century, however, the Tartar threat had diminished. Forest in the 18‚Äì19th centuryIn the Early 18th century the forest was protected from being cut down by regulations of Peter I. In 1701, the deforestation along the rivers was banned, then in 1703, the ban was extended to the small rivers. The edict included a ban on grazing and oaks, pines, maples and elms with trunk thicknesses of more than were excluded from felling.T. K. K Goryschyna: istorii sapowednika ¬´Les na Worskle¬ª.

After the October Revolution, the forest on the Vorskla was in danger with felling beginning in 1917, with grazing and vegetable gardens being introduced. Larger native animals almost disappeared. It fell to the entomologist Malyshev to begin a movement to save the forest. He knew the forest at the Vorskla from the time before the revolution when as a student he undertook entomological research there. In 1919 he wrote appeals to various authorities. He also appeared in the People's Assembly of the residents of Borisovka and made propaganda work for forest conservation in schools and village libraries.

The lodgings of the farmers, stables, barns and warehouses have consequently been transformed into residential buildings. There was also a park and an Italian garden, which have hence disappeared. The Villa was used as a holiday resort for the Tizzoni, Ottolini and Robbiani Milanese families. Architecture Villa Tizzoni Ottolini is built in the architectural style of the eighteenth century. The building has a portico with five arches topped by a wrought iron balcony and two service wings that are slightly lower. The central hall on the ground floor is dominated by a coffered ceiling. The patio leads to a staircase with a balustrade. In 1992, fragments of two eighteenth century frescoes were found in the central room on the first floor of the villa. They are white and blue: one representing an angel in the clouds with a burning torch in his hand, the other showing a mythological scene with a warrior, three women and a winged cherub with a crown in hand. There is also a visible sky fresco depicting Mercury. To the left of the Villa entrance one can find the Church of Santa Maria Immacolata which itself possesses two frescoes: the Nativity and the agony of St. Joseph.

In early 2004, Hicks added an individual NCAA air rifle title to her career tally in her senior season, while competing for the Murray State University. Just two months later, Hicks qualified for her first and only U.S. Olympic team in the 50 m rifle 3 positions at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, after placing second at the trials in Fort Benning. A less experienced to the international scene, Hicks marked 197 in prone, 189 in standing, and 191 in the kneeling series to put up a much steadfast aim in twelfth out of 33 shooters with a total score of 577, having been close to an Olympic final cutoff by a two-point margin.

Centered in Asmara it was at first the Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea and then the Apostolic Vicariate of Eritrea.  Foundation and development  On 13 September 1894, the Holy See established the Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea, then an Italian colony, with the decree Ut saluti animarum of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Its territory was taken from that of the Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia, which at that time had its headquarters in Keren, Eritrea, a town that became the first seat of the new Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea.Decree Ut saluti animarum, in Le canoniste contemporain, year 18, pp. 56-57, Paris 1895] On 7 February 1911, it was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate (with a titular bishop as ordinary). The Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia was entrusted to missionaries of the Congregation of the Mission, who followed the lead of Saint Giustino de Jacobis, the founder of the mission, by using in the liturgy the local Ethiopic variant of the Alexandrian Rite in the Ge'ez language, not the Roman Rite in Latin. They were mainly French and, after Eritrea was declared an Italian colony in 1890, were expelled by the colonial authorities, who accused them of fomenting armed resistance. The Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea was created for the Italian Capuchins, who replaced them. These promoted use of the Roman Rite, in view also of the arrival of Italian immigrants. Discontent among the Eritrean Catholics led to the sending in 1927 of the future cardinal Alexis L√©picier as an Apostolic Visitor to examine the situation. As a result, Father Kidan√®-Maryam Cass√† was appointed at first Pro-Vicar Apostolic for the Ethiopic-Rite Catholics and then, on 4 July 1930, bishop in charge of an independent Ordinariate of Eritrea.Brief History of the Catholic Eparchy of KerenGsbriele M. Roschini, \\"La vita e l'opera del cardinale Alessio M. L√©picier, O.S.M.\\"Annuario Pontificio 1964, p. 40Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Henry Louis Gates, Dictionary of African Biography (Oxford University Press 2012), vol. 8, pp. 368‚Äì369\\"Jet\\" magazine, 9 August 1962 The Eritrean Catholic Church is the continuation of this Ordinariate and of the first Eritrean Catholic community. The influx of Italians into Eritrea, especially in the 1930s, led to rapid expansion of the Vicariate, although it had thus in 1930 ceased to have responsibility for Ethiopic-Rite Catholics. On 25 July 1959, when already in steep decline, it was renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Asmara, the capital of Eritrea.  Decline and suppression Although at the beginning of the 1940s nearly 28% of the population of Italian Eritrea were Catholics, mostly Italians and of the Latin Church,Bandini, Franco. Gli italiani in Africa, storia delle guerre coloniali 1882-1943 Chapter: Eritrea there was a pronounced fall in the number of Italians present after the end of the Second World War, when Eritrea was at first under British military administration. The British census of 1949 showed that Asmara, the capital, had only 17,183 Italians out of a total population of 127,579. The departure of Italians accelerated further when Eritrea came under Ethiopian authority at the end of 1950. The Vicariate, which previously had under its jurisdiction the great majority of the Catholics in Eritrea, became less important numerically than the growing Ordinariate, which on 31 October 1951 was raised to the level of an exarchate (the Eastern equivalent of a Vicariate) under the name of the Apostolic Exarchate of Asmara, and on 28 February 1961 became an eparchy, the Eastern equivalent of a diocese.Annuario Pontificio 1964, p.40 When the fourth and last bishop who held the post of Vicar Apostolic of Eritrea or Asmara retired on 2 June 1974, no successor was appointed and the administration of the Vicariate was entrusted to a Capuchin priest. On 21 December 1995, after a quarter of a century of being without a bishop and being administered by a priest, the Vicariate was suppressedActa Apostolicae Sedis 1996, p. 354 at the same time as two new eparchies of the Ethiopian Catholic Church were formed from territory taken from the Eparchy of Asmara: BarentuActa Apostolicae Sedis 1996, p. 349 and KerenActa Apostolicae Sedis 1996, p. 350 (now suffragans of the Archeparchy of Asmara). With the suppression of the Vicariate, Eritrea was left with no Latin Church ordinary, and all Catholics in Eritrea were entrusted to the care of Eastern Catholic bishops, who since 19 January 2015 are prelates of the Eritrean Catholic Church. The former importance of the Latin Vicariate is reflected in the impressive church dedicated to Our Lady of the RosaryLa storia della cattedrale di Asmara, 2'44\\"Le chiese cattoliche di Asmara that was completed in 1923 as the principal church of the Apostolic Vicariate.

History  The Pink Poodle was built in 1967 and features a neon sign of a pink poodle. Many felt it was synonymous with the \\"glitzy\\" allure of the Gold Coast and it was frequently used as an image to depict the Gold Coast. The motel was demolished in 2004 but the sign was preserved and relocated a short distance to 18 Fern Street. A bar and restaurant in the new development that replaced it bears the name \\"The Pink Poodle\\". In 2005, the National Trust of Queensland nominated the sign to be one of Queensland's Heritage Icons. In 2015, the signage appeared on a postage stamp issued by Australian Post as part of its Signs of the Times series.

In 1961 he began his studies of painting and design at the School of Art in West Berlin. When the Soviet sector became segregated by the Berlin Wall, he married his girlfriend Waltraud Kolbow who lived in the eastern part of the city and they moved to Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg (East Berlin).

He made use of his talents by designing book covers for publishers. By intervention of Baudouin of Belgium, his wife and daughter were allowed to leave the German Democratic Republic in 1973 and settle in Belgium. In 1974 Roger Davis Servais continued his studies of art at West Berlin's School of Arts, which, in 1963, he had been forced to intermit. His most influential teacher was Otto Hofmann, a former pupil of the Bauhaus. In 1979 he became a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund.

He is a figurative artist, painter, graphic artist, sculptor and designer who unites opposing techniques in his works - geometric abstraction as well as elements of symbolism and surrealism. His paintings and drawings visualize complex religious, historic and autobiographic statements which are expressed in an indirect and subtle way and are partly encrypted.

The film co-written by M. Manikandan and produced by JPR Films, stars Kathir and Reshmi Menon. The film, featuring music composed by K and cinematography by Arul Vincent, released on 24 September 2015. Plot Kathir is a selfish youth in search of a job. Despite being married and having a child, he is waiting for a job offer that he feels meets his standards. Meanwhile, his wife Anitha is the breadwinner of the family. Prabhakar, a friendly neighbour who acts as his father figure, gets him a job as an informant with the less than honest local police inspector. Kathir uses this opportunity to take revenge against the violent bar owner who humiliated him in front of his friends, despite Prabhakar's advice. With his tip-off, the police raids the bar and arrests the owner for running an illegal gambling den as a side business. One night, Prabhakar is murdered by a group of thugs while scared Kathir runs for his life. Suspecting that Prabhakar was murdered because he too was an informant, Kathir starts becoming paranoid. Eventually, he comes to realize that the inspector he is working for is now in cohorts with the bar owner after being promised a large sum of money as commission in return for permission to run their illegal businesses. Since Kathir is the only witness for most of the inspector's corrupt activities, the inspector has the bar owner send his thugs to kill Kathir too. However, the inspector eventually feels sorry for Kathir and allows him to live as long as he stays silent about all the underground operations being carried out by the local police station. In the end, Kathir takes up a low-paying but proper job at his wife's garment factory and earns an honest living.

Manikandan, the director of Kaaka Muttai and a close friend of him, and composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, encouraged him to make a Tamil film, after hearing the script of Kirumi. Manikandan introduced Anucharan to Jayaraman, a former assistant, who had worked with actor Rajinikanth for 24 years and who decided to produce the venture along with his friends Prithiviraj and Rajendran as he liked the script since it was \\"contemporary\\" and had a message for society. Following G. V. Prakash Kumar's suggestion, Kathir was cast as the protagonist of Kirumi, who had also been part of Prakash Kumar's debut production Madha Yaanai Koottam. Despite the film being titled Kirumi (eng. Virus), Kathir said that the film would not deal with a virus or natural disasters but that it was a \\"realistic film that deals with the life of an ordinary youngster and how certain incidents change his course of life\\", while its director Anucharan added that the film had elements of a psychological thriller. He further informed that it was based on something he saw when he \\"was roaming on the streets of Chennai\\". Reshmi Menon signed on to portray the female lead in the film, although she was initially apprehensive as she felt that the role‚Äîa typical North Madras woman, sporting a \\"no-makeup\\" look and talking \\"proper Tamil\\"‚Äîwas \\"very much outside my comfort zone\\". David Solomon Raja, who had appeared in several television serials and as a police officer in Kaththi, was reported to have played a major role in the film. Arul Vincent, a former associate of P. C. Sreeram, was signed to handle the cinematography. 90 per cent of the film was filmed in Chennai while some shooting had taken place in Puducherry and Kovalam. In September 2014, Anucharan spoke with The New Indian Express and shared that \\"now it has been six months and Kirumi is almost complete.\\" It was announced in January 2015 that filming was complete and the project had moved into post production. Soundtrack Kirumi's music was composed by K. The soundtrack album features six tracks, sung by composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, Gana Bala, Yazin Nizar, Janani S. V. and K himself; all lyrics were written by Gnanakaravel. Upon its July 2015 release, the soundtrack met with critical approval. Karthik Srinivasan, writing for The Hindu, stated, \\"Composer K has been fairly consistent with his output even as the films they are part of...have been failing consistently. Kirumi's soundtrack is almost a comeback of sorts for K as he delivers a brilliant collection akin to the sound of Santhosh Narayanan. Topping the soundtrack is \\"Naanal Poovaai\\" that has a curiously ethereal sound (which becomes more evident and interesting in the karaoke version) and K uses the vocal interplay between himself and Janani to beautiful effect\\". Musicaloud.com gave a score of 8.5 out of 10 and similarly wrote that the music had \\"something of a Santhosh Narayanan/Sean Roldan type quality to it\\", but went on to add that it was not \\"a matter to complain about\\" and that the soundtrack \\"definitely ranks among K's top works\\". The score by K was also received well, with Sify writing that \\"the pulsating background score by K is the biggest strength of the movie; especially the intermission portion is top notch\\". Silverscreen.in wrote that the score was \\"soulful, and amply enhances the mood of the film\\". Release Escape Artists Motion Pictures signed contract for the distribution rights for the film across India. Kirumi was theatrically released on 24 September 2015, coinciding with the Bakrid festival, alongside five small-budget films. The film will have its international premiere at the 19th Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival, the first Tamil film to be screened there. =Critical reception= Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu wrote, \\"Sometimes, five minutes is all it takes to know that you're in the hands of a genuine filmmaker ‚Äî like Anucharan...In those five minutes, he establishes everything ‚Äî tone, texture...and the fact that this is an anti hero film..., a film that goes against the grain of the traditional heroics of Tamil cinema\\", going on to call the film a \\"superb, low-key character study masquerading as a thriller\\". The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \\"What makes Kirumi stand apart from other thrillers set in the backdrop of crime is its understated quality. Even when the situation offers scope to turn things into full-blown melodrama, Anucharan keeps things at a low key...and this refreshing change of pace actually keeps things interesting\\". Bangalore Mirror rated the film 4.5 out of 5 and wrote \\"For a debutant, Anucharan shows a lot of maturity as well as expertise and clearly proves to the audience that he is a new kid on the block who is worth watching\\". Sify wrote \\"Kirumi does have an original story and a tight screenplay. Well shot, well edited and brilliantly enacted by most of the lead actors, debutant director Anucharan gives us a bunch of fully flesh-and-blood characters with whom you can quickly relate to\\", describing the film as \\"pitch perfect\\". Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Kirumi is an example of how a script can be worked within the parameters of commercial cinema and also can be made entertaining without losing sight of reality and reason\\". One India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"Kirumi is an interesting thriller that largely gets a simple yet unique treatment. It is definitely an honest attempt by its director Anucharan\\". Behindwoods rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote \\"Kirumi is one of the better stories that you have come across in recent times, but its execution should have been on par with the smartness in the script\\" and called it a \\"safe one- time watch\\".

DKMS works in the areas of blood cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and raises awareness of the need for donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which people with blood cancers need for treatment as well as helping people sign up to their national bone marrow registries. Over the years, DKMS has expanded beyond Germany.  History  DKMS was founded in Germany in 1991 by billionaire Peter Harf, an executive with Coty, Inc., and university professor , the hematologist who treated his first wife Mechtild Harf.U. S. Board Members, dkms.org Website, retrieved: May 11, 2020 Mechtild had been diagnosed with leukemia, and while her cancer initially responded to drugs, she eventually needed a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSC) but none of her family members were a good match. Harf founded DKMS to raise awareness of the need for donors in Germany and to help people to register with the German national bone marrow registry. He included the whole family, including their 14-year-old daughter Katharina, in the effort. Within a year, the number of registered donors in Germany increased from 3,000 to 68,000. He continued building the organization afterwards. Katharina eventually moved to the United States to Harvard, worked for Louis Vuitton in New York City for a time, then started an MBA at Columbia University; she dropped out and instead founded the US affiliate of DKMS with her father in 2004. The US affiliate also works to raise awareness of the need for donors, helps people register with the National Marrow Donor Program, and if needed will help pay for any health tests, medication and travel costs. In 2014 DKMS began promoting May 28 as World Blood Cancer Day to help raise awareness. That year they also began offering grants to support scientists working on diagnosis or treatment of blood cancers, offering two people up to ‚Ç¨80,000 per year for up to three years.Mechtild Harf Research Grants DKMS Page archived 8 April 2018. Activities DKMS uses gala events and specific patient appeals to raise money and awareness.

She won a silver medal in small-bore rifle three positions at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and was selected to compete for Team USA, as a 19-year-old at the 2004 Summer Olympics. A former resident athlete of the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Blakeslee trained rigorously for the national rifle shooting team under the tutelage of David Johnson. Blakeslee's sporting debut in the worldwide scene came as an eighteen-year-old teen at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. There, she nailed down the silver in the rifle three positions at 668.2, losing the title to Cuba's Eglis Yaima Cruz by a slim 0.3-point deficit. With a noteworthy runner-up finish and a specific qualifying standard required in the selection, Blakeslee secured an Olympic berth for Team USA on her first Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Blakeslee qualified for the U.S. shooting team in the 50 m rifle 3 positions, after finishing ahead of her teammate Morgan Hicks for first place at the Olympic trials in Fort Benning, Georgia four months earlier. A less experienced to the international scene, Blakeslee marked a brilliant 197 in prone, 185 in standing, and 189 in the kneeling series to put up a much steadfast aim in a three-way tie with Cruz and Finland's Marjo Yli- Kiikka for twentieth place. Blakeslee's qualifying score of 571 was just eight points short of the final cutoff and six away from her Hicks, who placed twelfth.

Roberts, London, 1735. Sarah \\"Sally\\" Lodge (died 1735) was an English prostitute and brothel-keeper in London. She had a high-class clientele and knew Alexander Pope and John Gay but lost everything in a confidence trick and ended her life as a barmaid in a public house in Wapping. Early life According to a posthumously published and possibly unreliable account of her life titled A genuine epistle ... to the late famous Mother Lodge (1735), Sally Lodge was the daughter of a barber and a seamstress who died in debt and left her in the care of a vicar. The vicar placed her in domestic service but she was dismissed for petty theft. He then paid ¬£7 for her to be apprenticed for five years to a dressmaker but she complained that the work was drudgery and she was treated like a slave, so at the age of 14 she ran away and eventually started her own brothel in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields near Strand in London.Burford, E.

The venture was very successful due, in part, to the high class patrons it enjoyed from Court. Around 1720, an encomium, attributed to Alexander Pope, praised Lodge's establishment but lamented that age prevented the writer from enjoying it as he had in the past. > My Little LODGE, tease me no more With promise of the finest Whore That > cundum was e'er stuck in. Give younger men the beautious Dame; Alas! I'm > passed the am'rous Flame and must give over Fucking. Decline According to the 1735 epistle, Lodge lost all her money when she was conned by an Irish confidence trickster and, older now, she was unable to reestablish herself as a prostitute or a madam. She went to the West Indies as the mistress of a wealthy planter but he died soon after and she was sent back to London, penniless. She became a barmaid at the Whale public house in Wapping Broadway where she dispensed rum and brandy punch to sailors and died in 1735. Epitaph The poet and dramatist John Gay, who knew Lodge, summarised her life in this way: > Servant, Prentice, Whore, Mistress, Thief, Deserter Dupe, Derelict, > Emigrant, Nabobess - final Failure. In 1735, a biographical epistle addressed to \\"Mother Lodge\\" and stated to be written by a \\"Mrs Dunbo\\" but apparently describing Sally Lodge's life, appeared in London. It was published for her creditors to whom it was said Sally Lodge had died owing money and was stated to have been found among her possessions.A genuine epistle written some time since to the late famous Mother Lodge.

Biography  Hayyim was born in Kermanshah. He studied in the Alliance Israelite Universelle schools in Kermanshah and learned foreign languages. He was employed in the customs from 1914 and made good connections with the British embassy in Iran. He came to Tehran in 1920 and started working as a Journalist. He decided to start publishing a newspaper for the Iranian Jews called Ha-Hayyim. This newspaper was published between 1922 and 1925. Most of the newspaper was in Persian, but there were some Hebrew articles as well. Hayyim used the political power of his newspaper to encourage Jewish Iranians to fight politically. He wrote inflammatory articles criticizing the Iranian government for not giving Jews enough protection and not abolishing religious laws against Jews. Hayyim contacted the League of Nations and asked for help for Iranian Jewry. He also used the newspaper to spread Zionism among Iranian Jews. These actions made many enemies for him inside and outside the government. He became a candidate for Iranian parliament in 1923 and won with a landslide victory. However, Reza Khan did not like his political ambitions and he was arrested before the sixth parliament elections. His arrest led to his losing the election to Ayoub Loghman Nehourai. Subsequently, he was falsely charged with conspiracy to murder the Shah and attempting to overthrow the monarchy in favor of a republic - charges that were never substantiated, and later proven to have been instigated by his political rivals. He was tried in a military tribunal and condemned to death. He was held in prison for six years, and abruptly executed by firing squad in 1931.Religious Minorities in Iran, Eliz Sanasarian, Cambridge University Press, 2000, Page 180.Great Britain and Reza Shah, Mohammad Gholi Majd, University Press of Florida, 2001, Page 168.

Waterville Schools were their own independent school department, and Winslow and Vassalboro were part of School Union 52, along with China, which went to RSU 18 when the new state law came in 2009. On March 13th, 2018, Waterville, Winslow, and Vassalboro residents voted to dissolve AOS 92 by 253 votes. Each town will become their own independent school department on June 30, 2018. The votes were 183‚Äì58 in Waterville, 122‚Äì62 in Winslow, and 81‚Äì13 in Vassalboro; a snowstorm caused the turnout to be lower. On July 1, 2018 the district ceased to exist. Schools AOS 92 had 8 schools. VASSALBORO: * Vassalboro Community School, Grades PK-8 - Dianna Gram, Principal WATERVILLE: * George J. Mitchell School, Grades PK-3 - Alan Martin, Principal * Albert S.

WINSLOW: * Winslow Elementary School, Grades PK-5 - Kyle Price, Principal * Winslow Jr. High School, Grades 6-8 - Jason Briggs, Principal * Winslow High School, Grades 9-12 - Chad Bell, Principal NOTE: Winslow Schools were in the process of developing a new school system to get rid of the junior high, and send the 6th graders to the elementary, and add on for 7th and 8th graders at the high school, plus a new auditorium. A 600-seat one was included in a November 2017 referendum, but failed. A 415-seat one was included in a June 2018 referendum, and passed. District Auditorium Trask Auditorium at Waterville High School is the district auditorium. It has 698 seats. wshs.aos92.org/ AOS Timeline 2009 - AOS forms, Eric Haley is superintendent, Peter Thiboutot is assistant superintendent 2009-2018 - AOS in existence. 2017 - plans start to dissolve AOS 92.

Solem (born 1941) is an American theoretical physicist and Fellow of Los Alamos National Laboratory. Solem has authored or co-authored over 185 technical papers in many different scientific fields. He is known for his work on avoiding comet or asteroid collisions with Earth and on interstellar spacecraft propulsion.  Education and career  At Yale University, Johndale C. Solem earned his B.S. cum laude in Physics in 1963 and his Ph.D. in Physics in 1968. His Ph.D. thesis work under Glen A. Rebka, Jr. was on dynamic nuclear polarization in deuterium hydride. He then joined the Theoretical Division of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (subsequently known as Los Alamos National Laboratory) in New Mexico (1969-2000). Concurrently with his research, Solem held several management positions (1971-1988). Some of his appointments were: Group Leader of Thermonuclear Weapons Physics, Group Leader of Neutron Physics, Group Leader of High-Energy-Density Physics, Deputy Division Leader of Physics, and Associate Division Leader of Theory. Shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Solem led a U.S./Russia joint collaboration of scientists in an effort to obtain good science and to improve US/Russia relations.\\"The Dirac Series\\", (1996). Los Alamos Science 24: 68-71. Retrieved 2016-10-03. Solem served on the U. S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (1971-1978) and several DoD and DOE committees advising on science policy. He was Los Alamos' representative to the national missile Site Defense Systems Planning Study. He served on the Los Alamos Weapons Program Review Committee and high-level committees setting the direction of nuclear weapons development (1971-1988). Solem headed the Los Alamos Postdoctoral Research Program (1972-1978) and authored the program's charter, which is still in effect. While a consultant to the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, CA (1987-2005), he conducted research on antimatter technology and microrobotics, as well as national security issues. As a consultant to the University of Illinois at Chicago (1987-1988), his research involved x-ray lasers and microholography.  Scientific contributions  Solem's research activities have involved experimental, computational, and theoretical physics and mathematics, as well as other areas of science, including magnetism; particle and radiation transport; plasma physics; nuclear physics; nuclear explosive theory; equations-of-state; artificial intelligence and robotics; computational science; x-ray microholography; antiproton science and technology; mathematical physics; astrophysics; exotic methods of spacecraft propulsion; the foundations of quantum mechanics; and laser theory, particularly as it applies to conceptual designs for the gamma-ray laser. =Comets and asteroids= Solem's work on the interception and deflection of comets and asteroids on collision course with Earth (1993a, 2000) also led to a theory of the origin of the shape of rubble-pile asteroids. His analytic theory of the breakup of comets by planetary tidal forces resulted in his calculation of the diameter and density of the parent comet of Shoemaker-Levy 9 as it was before breaking up in the tidal field of Jupiter in 1994 (1994a). =Nuclear plasma pulse propulsion for interplanetary space travel= Solem's research on interplanetary travel culminated in his MEDUSA concept, a nuclear explosive propelled spacecraft for interplanetary space travel (1994b). Gregory Matloff said this was \\"a surprising [propulsion] concept which might greatly reduce spacecraft mass.\\" The concept inspired research and elaboration by the aerospace community. At the behest of NASA's Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project, Solem investigated whether a nuclear external pulsed plasma propelled (EPPP) interstellar probe could reach Alpha Centauri in 40 years, the average length of a scientist's career. No scheme could be found, even involving elaborate staging, that could accelerate such a vehicle much beyond 1% the speed of light.Millis, Mark G. (2012). \\"Epilogue, Appendix D, pg 359\\" \\"Deep Space Propulsion: A Roadmap to Interstellar Flight\\". Long, K. F. Springer Science+Business Media. Retrieved 2016-10-03. =Quantum mechanics= Solem discovered a strange polarization of the hydrogen atom that, contrary to intuition, drove electron orbits perpendicular to an applied electric field (1987). He elucidated the interpretation of geometric phase in quantum mechanics by showing the invalidity of superposition of quantal states, the distinction between rays and vectors in projective Hilbert space, and the meaning of resultant singularities (1993b). Using the symmetry of the Kepler Orbital Problem in operator formalism for both classical and quantum mechanics, Solem predicted a previously unknown elastic scattering process that will rotate the linear polarization of the scattered photon by ¬Ω\\\\pi (1997a). =Continuum mechanics= Solem examined the fundamental nature of foams under compression and showed a general hyperbolic stress-strain relation (1999). =Physical and chemical phenomena at extremely high magnetic fields= Solem provided leadership for a series of pioneering experiments, known as the Dirac Project, that used capacitor banks and Russian designed and built high-explosive-driven flux compression devices to investigate physical and chemical phenomena at extremely high magnetic fields and pressures (1997b). These experiments were an international collaboration of scientists from Russia, Germany, Japan, Australia, Belgium, several American universities, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. =Gamma-ray lasers= Solem contributed to many innovations in gamma-ray laser (graser) research, publishing more than a dozen papers over a period of twenty years. =Laser- driven shock waves= Solem and colleagues performed the first laser-driven experiments on shock-wave structure (1977, 1978) and the first impedance-match experiments. =Advanced lasers of extremely short wave lengths= While on sabbatical at the University of Illinois at Chicago (1987-1988), Solem engaged in research with academic colleagues to probe the limits starting with a large krypton-fluoride excimer laser at the University's laser laboratory, which would produce short intense pulses of 248-nm radiation. He and his colleagues investigated many-electron motions in multiphoton ionization and excitation, fifth-harmonic production in neon and argon, strong-field processes in the ultraviolet, generation of very short wavelengths in BaF2, which produced x-rays 9-13 √Ö and the kinetic energy distributions of ionic fragments produced by subpicosecond multiphoton ionization of N2 (1988a, 1989b, 1991a). =X-ray microholography= Solem wrote a paper on the use of x-ray microholography to image biological specimens (1982). As a result, this early work, research in pursuit of x-ray holography has continued at University of California at Berkeley, University of Illinois, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, industrial firms, and in France and Germany. Solem observed that by using intense, pulsed coherent x-ray sources, it is possible to obtain magnified three-dimensional images of elementary biological structures in the living state (1996a). =Theory of high-intensity laser-beam self-channeling= While at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Solem and colleagues developed an analytic theory of charge-displacement self-channeling as a mechanism to extend atomic lasers to higher quantum energy and then broadened this theory to the development of KeV-range laboratory x-ray lasers (1989c, 1994d). =Robotics= Solem created a high-level programming language for controlling personal robots. In addition to initiating a laboratory program in artificial intelligence and robotics, Solem did \\"pioneering\\" calculations on the motility of microrobots (1994e). He showed unique mechanisms for self-assembly of motile microrobots based on Platonic solids, in particular the dodecahedron, which can assemble into a helix appropriate for propulsion at high-Reynolds number (2002). He described several microrobots for military applications (1996b). =Advanced computers= In addition to organizing and leading the development of several large-scale physics application computer codes, Solem developed a concept for massively parallel supercomputer architecture specialized for Monte Carlo solution of integro-differential equations (1985a, 1985b). =National defense policy= Solem developed ideas regarding nuclear deterrence for national defense policy (1974, 1981b). =Nuclear technology research and pure nuclear fusion= Solem contributed ideas of using beta- particle spectroscopy to measure mix processes in National Ignition Facility (NIF) microcapsules (2006). =Universal origin of life= Solem worked on a universal, astrophysically-based theory of the origin of life by natural processes arising from non-living matter starting with the minimum possible information, or the minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, along with thermodynamically free energy. He developed underlying physical criteria for the minimum size necessary for molecules in order to become self- replicating (2003a). =Antimatter science and technology= Solem worked out techniques to use very small quantities of antiprotons stored in a Penning trap, or similar charged-particle storage device, to perform Lilliputian experiments in high energy density physics, including opacity and equation-of- state measurements (1988b, 1990). He worked on spacecraft propulsion using antimatter. He developed the re-entrant-\\\\pi scheme for the efficient use of antiproton annihilation energy (1991b), while consulting for the RAND Corporation. =Mathematics= Solem collaborated on the development of pseudo characteristic functions of convex polyhedra, a result providing rapid regional particle location in Monte Carlo calculations (2003b).

Without her father's knowledge, she has invited the officers of the East Anglian Hussars to their home, Egbert Castle, for a day and night of entertainment. She forges two telegrams that send her father into town on some urgent political pretext and later his butler to follow him. Her father wisely locks her in her room during his absence, but her friend, Gwenny, and lady's maid, Susan, secures a ladder to help her to escape from the window. Although she detests wealth, Lady Betty is interested in a rich, eccentric young trooper, who calls himself Smith, and whose prowess at cricket have caught her eye. She disguises herself as a servant, and has Gwenny impersonate her, so that she can get close to Smith. Meanwhile, two men from the village, attracted by the Earl's advertisement for a rich man to court his daughter, arrive at the castle and mistake each of Gwenny and Susan for Lady Betty; they are both impostors pretending to be wealthy. Betty flirts with Smith and persuades him to pretend to be the butler, which he does, donning the butler's uniform. That evening at the servants' ball, class distinctions disappear, as the officers enjoy the entertainment and company of servants and gentry alike. Betty continues her flirtations with Smith and is well-pleased with the progress of her elaborate mischief. Lord Framingham returns angrily but is soothed that his daughter's suitor is, at least, rich. The impostors are discovered, and all ends happily.

Floyd College of Medicine is a public medical school headquartered in Spokane, Washington. Founded in 2015, it is part of Washington State University, and is the second public medical school in the state of Washington. It welcomed its inaugural class in the fall of 2017, joining the University of Washington and Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences as one of three medical schools in the state. History The Washington State University School of Medicine was established by the WSU board of regents in 2015, after the state legislature amended a 1917 statute that gave the University of Washington in Seattle the exclusive right as a public institution to grant degrees in medicine in the state. The creation of a medical school at Washington State University was opposed by the University of Washington; both WSU and UW issued contradictory reports in 2014 as to the viability of a second public medical school in the state. The increasingly acrimonious debate between the two institutions was described as a \\"feud\\" in media reports and state senator Andy Hill chastised the two schools for forcing the legislature to \\"become the parent in this dispute.\\" Confusion created by the unexpected resignation of UW president Michael K. Young, however, largely muted the University of Washington's opposition to the project. In July 2015, the board of regents announced their intention to name the medical school after the late WSU president Elson Floyd; the name was officially changed to the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine that September. After a national search, Dr. John Tomkowiak was selected as dean. In February 2016, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education granted the school candidate status, the first in a multistep process toward accreditation. In October 2016, Washington State University announced that the LCME had granted preliminary accreditation to the school. In August 2016, the Spokane Teaching Health Clinic on campus opened. It is intended to provide experiential learning to pharmacy and nursing students and was created by a consortium of WSU, Empire Health Foundation, and Providence Health Care to gain support for more federal residency positions in Spokane. Instruction On August 18, 2017, the school held its white coat ceremony for the inaugural class of 60 students. The school uses a community-based model of medical education, training physicians for the first two years on the WSU Spokane campus, then distributing the class across four regional campuses located in: Everett, Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Vancouver. In the first two years, students study the foundational sciences for medicine, integrated with the fundamentals of clinical practice. Students begin their education with a two-week intensive training program; learning the basics of taking patient history, taking vital signs, conducting a physical exam, and other fundamentals clinical skills. After completing the training program, students travel to their assigned regional site to complete the first of three, one-week clinical \\"intersessions.\\" These clinical experiences are continued at the beginning of every quarter during years one and two, and are also where students will complete their third- and fourth-year clinical clerkships. After returning to the Spokane campus in the fourth week, students begin their first curriculum block, anatomy and histology. Students split their time between classroom instruction, cadaver lab, and self-directed learning through weekly small group case-based-learning sessions. Not far from the WSU Spokane campus, Sacred Heart Medical Center has long had a relationship with the WSU College of Pharmacy and as clinical partner it hosts a residency program that offers a teaching certificate. =Leadership certificate= In addition to the Doctor of Medicine degree, graduates of the school will also receive a graduate certificate in Leadership, reflecting the school's integration of non-medical management coursework into its curriculum.

Industry- Specific Definitions  = Computer Science = In computer science, a deployment is a realisation of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment. Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard. For example, web browsers contain implementations of World Wide Web Consortium-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain deployment of programming languages. A special case occurs in object-oriented programming, when a concrete class deploys an interface; in this case the concrete class is an deployment of the interface and it includes methods which are deployments of those methods specified by the interface. = Information Technology (IT) = In the IT Industry, deployment refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customisations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using project management methodologies. Software Deployment involves several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as business analysts, technical analysts, solutions architects, and project managers. To deploy a system successfully, a large number of inter- related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an deployment project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results. = Political Science = In political science, deployment refers to the carrying out of public policy. Legislatures pass laws that are then carried out by public servants working in bureaucratic agencies. This process consists of rule-making, rule- administration and rule-adjudication. Factors impacting deployment include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the deploying bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and executive support. = Social and Health Sciences = \\"Deployment is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions. According to this definition, deployment processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the \\"specific set of activities\\" related to implementation. In addition, the activity or program being deployed is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength.\\" The National Implementation Research Network = Water and Natural Resources = In water and natural resources, deployment refers to the actualisation of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies. Types: *Direct changeover *Parallel running or as known as parallel *Pilot introduction or as known as pilot *Well-trade *Phased Deployment  Role of End Users  System deployment generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome. Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions. The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems deployment efforts. Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities. This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap. These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies. Examples of these differences or concerns are below: = User Concerns = * Will the system deliver the information I need for my work? * How quickly can I access the data? * How easily can I retrieve the data? * How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system? * How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?Laudon, K., & Laudon, J.

It is a shrub with thin, stiff branches and tiny, heart-shaped leaves, both covered with wart-like tubercles. Single white flowers with purple spots develop in the leaf axils and are followed by wrinkled green or brown fruits. It is endemic to a small area in the south- west of Western Australia Description Myoporum cordifolium is an erect shrub which grows to a height of . It has wart-like tubercles covering its thin, stiff, twiggy branches and tiny, crowded, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are fleshy, long and wide. The flowers are solitary in the axils of the leaves and have 5 sepals and 5 white, spotted pink petals joined at their base to form a tube. The tube is long and the lobes are spreading and long. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. Flowering occurs from June to November and is followed by wrinkled green or brown fruits which are drupes, long and slightly flattened. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum cordifolium was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae and given the name Disoon cordifolius. In 1917, George Claridge Druce transferred it to the present genus. The specific epithet (cordifolium) is derived from the Latin words cor, genitive cordis, \\"heart\\" and folium, \\"leaf\\", meaning \\"with heart-shaped leaves\\".Backer, C.A. (1936).

The artwork is a site-specific piece located at the forecourt of the Museum of Sydney, Sydney since its opening in 1995. The artwork is constructed with 29 vertical pillars made from different materials such as wood, steel, and sandstone collaborating with other organic materials and sound elements. This public art installation has won several awards as it evokes the cultural and physical history of the site. Philosophy and meaning The intention of the artwork is to interpret and make reference to the past: the indigenous, the displaced, and the land. The name of the sculpture originated in an essay by historian Rhys Maengwyn Jones: \\"‚Ä¶the \\"discoverers\\" struggling through the surf were met on the beaches by other people looking at them from the edge of the trees.Ordering the Landscape in Thus the same landscape perceived by the newcomers as alien, hostile, or having no coherent form, was to the indigenous people their home, a familiar place, the inspiration of dreams.\\" Edge of the Trees symbolises the interaction between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people at this site, which was a significant site of first contact. The artists express such idea as they delivered multiple layers of memories of the site through the language of materials, naming, and mapping and the memories include: the botanical memory, the Eora memory, and the Colonial memory. The sculpture is a site-specific art that made direct reference to the Museum of Sydney. The concept of the museum is the Historic Houses Trust and the senior curator, Peter Emmett. Laurence was one of the artists who was invited to submit a proposal for the limited competition for the museum. The competition brief invited the artists to \\"engage with the architecture in dialogue, counterpoint, even tension\\". Laurence invited Aboriginal artist Fiona Foley to collaborate with her to directly respond to the culturally charged symbolism of the site. Foley was able to bring in the authentic cultural input and authority to incorporate materials that a non-Aboriginal artist could not have. Material naming and mapping Close up of organic materials such as hair, shell, bone, and feathers embedded in windows of timber pillar Close up view of one of the timber pillars with Latin and Aboriginal language engravings Edge of the Trees is a \\"forest\\" of 29 massive pillars made of wood, steel and sandstone clustering at the museum forecourt near the entrance. Wooden pillars points to the grove of trees that once occupied the site. The pillars were Ironbark and Tallow wood trees which were collected from around Sydney. The sandstone material is to suggest Sydney's historical building material and the substance on which Sydney is built. Steel is used to link to the steel and glass features of the museum architecture, extending the building and reflecting upon the industrial developments since the colonial period. Organic materials such as human hair, shell, bone, feathers, ash and honey, are embedded in windows within the wood pillars, symbolising and memorialising the lives that lived around the site. Natural and cultural histories are evoked by the names of botanical species carved or burnt into wooden columns in both Latin and Aboriginal languages, along with the signatures of First Fleeters. Words are engraved onto the pillars such as the species from pollen readings of the Governor's garden and the names of the first fleeters who arrived in Sydney in 1788. Place names are also engraved on the sandstone pillars in Latin and Aboriginal languages. The 29 vertical poles correspond to the 29 Aboriginal clans from around Sydney. As the work is designed not to be viewed from a distance but experienced up close as part of the sensual and spatial encounter, the audience are invited to touch and run their fingers along the engraved names and to feel the textures of the different materials. Walking between the pillars you hear a soundscape of Koori voices reciting the names of places in the Sydney region that have today been swallowed up by the metropolis. This is also a way to celebrate the moment in time. Awards * 1995: Lloyd Rees Award for Outstanding Urban Design, Australian Institute of Architects.

EME involves the use of a small supported liquid membrane (SLM) sustained in the wall of a porous hollow fiber, and application of an electrical field across the SLM. Principle Target compounds are extracted from an aqueous sample, through a ¬µL-volume of organic solvent sustained as a thin supported liquid membrane (SLM) in the pores in the wall of a porous hollow fiber, and into an acceptor solution inside the lumen of the hollow fiber. Extraction is based on electrokinetic migration in an electrical field sustained across the SLM. The volume of the acceptor solution is typically 5-25 ¬µL. The acceptor solution is an aqueous solution, and can be analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE). Advantages EME is closely related to liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and provides high pre-concentration and efficient sample clean-up. In addition, because the extraction is performed under the influence of an electrical field, the extraction selectivity can be controlled by the direction and the magnitude of the electrical field.Astrid Gjelstad, Stig Pedersen-Bjergaard Electromembrane extraction ‚Äì Three phase electrophoresis for future preparative applications Electrophoresis 35 (2014) 2421-2428.

A map from Benedictine Abbey of St. George in the Black Forest indicates that, on the present site of the Blood Court, a gallows was erected in the late 16th century. A historical map known as the P√ºrschgerichtskarte, which charts the area around the free imperial town of Rottweil, shows two wooden gallows on this spot. The present stone gallows replaced its wooden predecessors in 1721. As a symbol of justice of the Anterior Austrian Obervogtei of Triberg, the execution site was visible for a long distance. By 1779, 15 executions are recorded, twelve of them for witchcraft. The gallows consist of two sandstone pillars, reinforced with iron bands, and linked by a wooden crossbeam that was added later. The southeastern pillar bears the date 1721, the other one two initials, probably a mason's mark. The Middle Way from Pforzheim to Waldshut runs by the gallows.

He was also elected as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) of the 13th Parliament of Singapore from 16 September 2015 to 22 June 2020. Perera co-founded and was the CEO of Spire Research and Consulting, an international business research and consulting agency. He is a member of the Economic Society of Singapore, the EDB Society and the Singapore Institute of Directors.  Education and early career  Perera studied at Anglo-Chinese School, Hwa Chong Junior College, and obtained a Double First Class Honours degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford University. Perera began his career as a Senior Officer with the Singapore Economic Development Board‚Äôs International Business Development Division, serving first in the policy planning function supporting Singapore‚Äôs regional investments. He later served as Assistant Head in the EDB‚Äôs Enterprise Development Division, assisting in the growth of large Singaporean companies in the service sector spanning logistics, education and health care, to information technology (IT) services, engineering and retail.  Political career  Prior to contesting in elections, Perera was a WP grassroots activist at Aljunied Group Representation Constituency's (GRC) Paya Lebar division. At the 2015 Singapore general election, Perera contested as a member of the WP team for the East Coast GRC alongside A/Prof Daniel Goh, Gerald Giam, and Mohamed Fairoz Bin Shariff. His team received 39.27% of the votes cast, with the People's Action Party garnering 60.73% of votes to win the GRC. The WP East Coast GRC team was the best performing opposition team among and one of the team members was thus eligible to take up the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seat. The Workers' Party nominated Perera to be an NCMP for Singapore's 13th Parliament. = NCMP term = Following the Hepatitis C outbreak at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in October 2015 which contributed to the deaths of five patients, Perera called on the government to convene a Committee of Inquiry (COI) to help \\"restore confidence\\" in Singapore's public health institutions. He also requested that the names of SGH and Ministry of Health staff responsible for the outbreak be released, and questioned what penalties or warnings were imposed on these staff. On the debate over the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), Perera highlighted how the proposed tool \\"is a cure worse than the disease\\" as too much power is given to individual Ministers and the potential for the law to stifle free speech. The law was eventually passed on 8 May 2019. = 2020 General Election = Perera contested in Aljunied GRC (Serangoon Division) during the 2020 Singapore general election, taking over from Sylvia Lim, who would take the Paya Lebar division from Chen Show Mao. The WP retained Aljunied GRC with an increased majority in the 2020 election, resulting in Perera being elected MP, together with Sylvia Lim, Pritam Singh, Gerald Giam and Muhamad Faisal Manap, all in Aljunied GRC.

Living with his father in a small town in Middlesex, South East England, Albert began to learn from James and started creating notable paintings of animals ‚Äì namely horses ‚Äì under the 19th century na√Øve style. At the age of 17, Albert Clark had defined himself as a ‚Äòna√Øve animal artist‚Äô and was first recorded under the profession on the 1861 census. At the age of 24, Albert married Ellen Parsons and the couple went on to have 4 children together; one of which being Frederick Albert Clark who, like his predecessors, also went on to be an artist. In 1873 ‚Äì 5 years after they married - during the birth of the couples 3rd and 4th children, Ellen died. In 1873, having been widowed for 2 years, Albert Clark remarried Harriet Jane Ireland and fathered a further 3 children which included the acclaimed animal artist, William Albert Clark. Once married, the couple moved to Islington allowing Albert to be closer to his father. After 23 years of marriage, Harriet died and Albert was once again a widow. Although he produced many portraits of cattle and dogs throughout his career, Albert‚Äôs speciality ‚Äì like his father‚Äôs ‚Äì lied in the portraiture of horses. With these paintings being a well known amongst the Clark family, James produced a portrait entitled ‚ÄúThe Runaway Horse‚Äù which he dedicated to Albert. Similarly, in later years, Albert reproduced his version of his father‚Äôs painting under the new title ‚ÄúBreaking Loose‚Äù which he in turn dedicated to his son, William. Having been recognised for his ability to paint racehorses, Albert Clark was regularly commissioned to paint such scenes ‚Äì often with the jockey alongside his steed. Furthermore, with the annual Islington Horse Show held near the artist‚Äôs London home, Albert regularly painted portraits of the show‚Äôs prize winning animals. At the age of 57, 40 years into his career as an animal artist, Albert Clark was reported deaf. Despite this impairment, the artist continued to paint animal portraits for many years. In December 1928, Albert Clark died age 85.

It included a small library of books and a reading room and opened on 30 August 1878. The building was extended in 1898 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, including a new reading room, gymnasium and classrooms. The extension was opened by the Duke of Norfolk. In 1922 the library became part of the Municipal Borough of Lytham St Annes with the amalgamation of St Anne's on the Sea and Lytham Urban District Councils. In 1974 the administration of the library was taken over by Lancashire County Council. In Buildings of England Hartwell and Pevsner describe its 'Dark red and yellow and black brick dressings, including dentil sill bands and 'quoins'. Steep coped gables with jaunty finials, and lancets. Bay windows of yellow brick'.Hartwell, Clare and Pevsner, Nikolaus (2009), The buildings of England - Lancashire: North, Yale University Press, p.435  The building and opening of the Library  The Lytham Times of September 4, 1878 Supplement to the Lytham and Kirkham Times; St Anne's-on-the-Sea Gazette; and Lancashire Advertiser, 4 Sept Jan 1878 included a 2-page supplement celebrating the opening of the Institute by the Right Honourable George Cavendish Bentnick, MP. It describes a public meeting, addressed by the Bishop of Manchester, and held on 22 October 1876 which was arranged to examine the possibilities of the building of the Institute. There was an initial donation of ¬£300 from Lady Eleanor Cecily Clifton of Lytham Hall. Numerous other donations followed including ¬£1000 by the Misses Hewitt of Lytham. Their contribution is commemorated in the name of the Hewitt Lecture Room. Lytham Times of 4 September 1878 The building and development of the institute was overseen by a committee chaired by the Reverend Henry Beauchamp Hawkins of St Cuthbert's Church, the parish church of Lytham, and the Lytham Times supplement details the various local firms which had worked on the project. It was designed and built by John Collinson of Lytham. Gas fittings were supplied by Mr Rainford of Lytham. Hot water apparatus was supplied by Messrs. Seward of Preston. A Mr Poulton oversaw the fitting of the library and a Captain Banister acted as clerk of works. The site had been donated by the squire, John Talbot Clifton of Lytham Hall. The Preston Chronicle of 28 October 1876 describes the meeting of 22 October of that year: \\"The chairman in opening the proceedings, stated that for some time the young men of Lytham had felt the want of a place where they could meet for social intercourse, and to read and think\\".The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser, 28 Oct 1876, p.5, col. d In the 1870s women's sphere of influence would have been seen as primarily home and domestic life so it's not surprising that the Institute was conceived as a place for men to meet and talk. At the opening ceremony a Mr Hodgson Pratt was present, presumably the same man who was a member of the council of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union and founder of the International Arbitration and Peace Association. He also spoke to the gathering and, in reference to the Reform Bills, commented that, 'With every fresh extension of the suffrage it became their duty to see that the people were educated and qualified for the new and great responsibilities rested in them. There was an immense amount of political ignorance in the country, and he would advise working men to read carefully and thoroughly political history'.Supplement to the Lytham and Kirkham Times; St Anne's-on-the-Sea Gazette; and Lancashire Advertiser, 4 Sept Jan 1878, p.1 col. d It would be 1918 before women over 30 were given the vote and another 10 years that before there were equal voting rights. At the time of the opening of the Lytham Institute, it would be a place that men could educate themselves for their new role in the democratic system.  The development of the Library  Barrett's 1929 Directory of Blackpool of the Fylde describes Lytham Institute as 'a neat Gothic building' which 'contains billiard, reading, and lecture rooms and a library of 3500 volumes'.P Barrett & Co. (1929), Barrett's general and commercial directory of Blackpool and the Fylde, Mather Bros, Preston p.505 It goes on to describe how the extension was opened by the Duke of Norfolk on 8 January 1898. The extension included a reading room, gymnasium and additional classrooms. The original building had cost about ¬£3000 to build in 1878 and the extension a further ¬£1500. The architect was Thomas Grimble of Warton Street in Lytham and the building contractor was a George Myers.

Life Forman received his B.A. degree in 1511 and in 1514 he was elected as a Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. He took his Doctorate in Divinity in 1524 and in 1525 he was elected as President of the college and also became the rector of one of the wealthiest parishes in London, All Hallows Honey Lane. Forman was staunch adherent of the Reformation and distributed the books of Luther and Tyndale from London booksellers to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and elsewhere when they were proscribed in England. In February 1526 he is thought to have tipped of the White Horse Group prior to a raid by Sir Thomas More. In 1528, Forman was arrested in London and his curate, Thomas Gerrard, was picked up in Oxford as part of a two-pronged investigation to the illicit book trade. He was interrogated by Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of London, and denied sending the books to Oxford but freely admitted having them in his possession. Tunstall was not convinced and advised Cardinal Wolsey to take sureties for good behavior. An intervention by Anne Boleyn, who wrote to Wolsey, allowed Forman and Garred to be released.

Playing at halfback, he played for the 1905 Original All Blacks, the first New Zealand representative team to tour the British Isles. He was the only halfback taken on the tour, and played in 28 of their 32 matches in the British Isles. New Zealand rugby historian Winston McCarthy wrote of Roberts that he was \\"a superb passer, a judicious runner from the scrum, and excellent two-foot kicker and a giant on defence.\\" Roberts continued to be selected by the All Blacks until 1910, when he captained the New Zealand team on their tour of Australia.  Original All Blacks  Having represented Wellington since 1901, Roberts was selected for the historic 1905‚Äì06 New Zealand team to tour the British Isles. This was the first New Zealand representative side to visit Britain and Ireland, and the team became known as the \\"Original All Blacks\\". Roberts was the only halfback selected in the squad and this did raise concerns in the press over what would happen if he was injured. However Roberts ended up playing more matches than any other All Black on tour, 30. The side had enormous success, winning 35 of their 36 matches. Their only loss was a narrow 3‚Äì0 defeat to Wales. Roberts played in that Test match, as well as the Tests against England, Ireland and Scotland. He did not play against France, with Billy Stead taking his place. Of their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39, and overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. After the British Isles leg of the tour, the team traveled through North America to San Francisco. After playing two matches against British Columbia there, the team returned to New Zealand. Roberts was ill however, and remained in San Francisco for several weeks with Wellington teammate Billy Wallace. After surgery to remove his infected tonsils, Roberts recovered well enough to travel back to New Zealand; only a few weeks after he and Wallace departed, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, destroying the hotel in which they'd been staying.  Later career  alt=Photo of a group of rugby players posing in their uniforms. Roberts continued to play for both Wellington and New Zealand after the tour. He toured with New Zealand to Australia in 1907, and in 1908 played two Tests against the Anglo-Welsh team in New Zealand. The Anglo-Welsh played three Tests against the All Blacks while on tour, but Roberts missed the second due to injury. The first and third were comfortably won by New Zealand, 32‚Äì5 and 29‚Äì0. Roberts' last appearance for the All Blacks was on their 1910 tour of Australia. He was appointed captain, and appeared in all three Test matches. The New Zealand side was relatively inexperienced, only seven had appeared for New Zealand before, but they won the Test series 2‚Äì1 after winning the third Test 28‚Äì13. He continued to play provincially for Wellington until 1912, and was involved with his Wellington club Oriental for a number of years. His record of 58 appearances for Wellington was the team's record until overtaken by Ranji Wilson.

The rock is a prominent landmark and has the shape of a dog's head when viewed from the western side, leading to the name. Dog rock has become a popular tourist attraction for the area. The Noongar people know the rock as Yacka which means \\"wild dog tamed\\"; it is thought to be an ancient territorial boundary marker. Local Aboriginal people will not camp near the rock or shelter beneath it, although the reason is not known. In 1921 the Council proposed demolishing the rock with explosives so as to widen the road. The idea was met with protests and petitions along with an angry exchange during a council meeting resulting in the proposal being quashed. The Royal Automobile Club labelled the rock a danger to traffic in 1938 as it encroached onto the road. The local authorities then painted the distinctive white collar around the base of the rock to make it more visible. In the 1960s, the manager of the local radio station 6VA, suggested that the rock should be moved to the roundabout of Albany Highway, Denmark Road, North Road and Chester Pass Road. He believed that this would make it a more central tourist destination, and that the rock could be cut into slices and moved piece by piece and then rebuilt at the new site. The rock was classified by the National Trust in 1973 and adopted into the municipal inventory in 2001.

The generic name derives from the penteconter, a warship from ancient Greece, and the suffix -pterus, which means \\"wing\\" and is often used in other genus of eurypterids. The specific name refers to Decorah, Iowa, where Pentecopterus was discovered. The genus is classified as part of the Megalograptidae family of eurypterids, a family differentiated from other eurypterids by the possession of two or more pairs of spines per podomere on prosomal appendage IV, a reduction of almost all spines and the large exoskeletons with ovate to triangular scales. It is estimated that Pentecopterus had a length of , turning it into one of the largest eurypterids or arthropods ever discovered. However, Pentecopterus was overtaken by other eurypterids such as Jaekelopterus rhenaniae, the largest known arthropod with . A replica of the eurypterid was created for the National Geographic's \\"Strange Truth\\" program. The project had the help of James Lamsdell, one of the paleontologists who contributed to the description of Pentecopterus, who provided information and two illustrations. When it was finished, it was taken to the impact site where the original fossils were discovered. Description Life restoration of P. decorahensis. Pentecopterus is among the largest known arthropods, with the largest specimens having an estimated length of . With this size, it exceeds all other genera of the Megalograptidae. While fragmentary tergites have been suggested to indicate a length of for Megalograptus shideleri, they actually indicate a length of at most . Most Pentecopterus specimens would have had a total length of . The large amount of fragmentary specimens recovered of Pentecopterus, including juveniles and exuviae specimens, have allowed an almost complete description of the external morphology. Pentecopterus is diagnosed as a megalograptid retaining a single pair of spines on the third podomere of the third prosomal appendages, a short appendage V with a serrated distal margin of podomeres; prosomal ventral plates widening anteriorly, posterolateral pretelson lacking expansion and xiphos-like shaped telson, with a margin laterally ornamented with scales. The prosomal ventral plate is of Erieopterus-type, that is, it consists of a single plate that covers the anterior and lateral portion of the ventral carapace. The appendages are attached to the soft ventral integument of the plate. The general outline of the carapace was quadrate with an elongate trapezoidal outline. History of research Map showing the eurypterids found in Iowa and their fossil locations. The most of the fossils of the Winneshiek Shale of Decorah, where the fossils of Pentecopterus have been found, were recovered in 2010 from the upper 4 m section of the from the mentioned site of Iowa. Other samples were collected from blocks eroded during flooding, which are assumed to have been sourced from the uppermost 2‚Äì3 m. The total number of fossils found is over 5,000, of which around 6.6% belong to eurypterids. Among the material eurypterid is the holotype of Pentecopterus, SUI 139941, which consists of a prosomal ventral plate and proximal podomeres of prosomal appendage II, in addition to multiple paratypes and additional material, all housed in the University of Iowa Paleontology Repository. The genus was named by James C. Lamsdell, Derek E. G. Briggs, Huaibao P. Liu, Brian J. Witzke and Robert M. McKay in 2015 and the type species is Pentecopterus decorahensis. It is the only eurypterid discovered in Iowa together with Mycterops whitei, a species whose assignment to Mycterops is doubtful. The genus is named after the penteconter, an early galley (ship) from ancient Greece and one of the first true warships, due to some similarities in shape and that the taxon represents an early predator. The epithet -pterus means \\"wing\\" and is commonly applied to eurypterid genera. The specific name decorahensis refers to Decorah, Iowa, where the fossils were discovered. Classification The size of P. decorahensis compared to a human. Pentecopterus is classified within the family Megalograptidae in the monotypic superfamily Megalograptoidea. Pentecopterus shares with the other megalograptids a series of characteristics such as the randomly-oriented armature on the swollen podomeres of appendage IV and the narrow gnathobase bearing multiple rows of small teeth on the coxa of appendage V. It also shares with Megalograptus the rows of enlarged scales running down the center of the opisthosomal tergites, however, these differ from those of Megalograptus because they are not situated on pronounced ridges. It is separated from the other megalograptids by the presence of only one pair of spines on the third podomere of appendage III, a single terminal spine on each prosomal appendage, and the absence of dense cuticular ornamentation. Pentecopterus also lacks the cercal blades that occur in Megalograptus, where they have been interpreted as functioning as a biological rudder, like the pterygotid telson. This suggests that Pentecopterus was less able to swim than Megalograptus. Further, Pentecopterus has some features unique among the eurypterids, notably the shape of its carapace and the unusual shape of the sixth podomere of appendage VI. Pentecopterus also possesses lateral scales on the telson, something otherwise only seen in pterygotid eurypterids. This feature likely arose through convergent evolution. The cladogram below is simplified from a study by Lamsdell et al. (2015), showing the phylogenetic positions of the genera within Megalograptidae. Paleoecology A pair of P. decorahensis in their habitat illustrated by Patrick J. Lynch. Pentecopterus is known from Middle Ordovician deposits in the Winneshiek Shale of Iowa dated to the Darriwilian (467.3 mya). The Winneshiek Shale is an 18‚Äì27 m thick greenish brown to dark grey laminated sandy shale that crops out only in one locality which is mostly submerged by the Upper Iowa River near Decorah. Bore hole data indicate that the total thickness of the Winneshiek Shale is about 18 m at the outcrop locality, but only the upper 4 m was systematically collected during the excavation. In these 4 m, most of the Pentecopterus fossils were collected. This shale is confined to a circular basin about 5.6 km in diameter in the Decorah area that probably originated from a meteorite impact. Palaeogeographic and paleoenvironmental studies suggest that this crater was located in marginal to nearshore marine conditions with little oxygen, possibly in a brackish water environment within the tropical southern Laurentia. The Winneshiek fauna is very different from the shelly marine fossil fauna, which indicates that this environment was inhospitable to the typical marine taxa. This fauna was composed of conodonts, arthropods, possible jawless fishes and algae.

Production  Water scoop or mill (kara-usu), used for the preparation of the earth The earth for the pottery is found in Onta in the mountains. It normally comes in the form of rocks and needs to be ground to a pulver. This is done by the usage of traditional water scoops or mills called kara-usu, which rely purely on the flow of the river. The wooden mills grind the earth into a powder, which is then washed and filtered multiple times to purify the material. It is then dried, sometimes over a large oven. The village is a tightly-knit community, with families of potters going back generations. The work such as the purification of the earth is done by women, while men are responsible for actually creating the wares. Pieces are never signed by an individual but only with the sign of the Onta village. This is to signify that the production of a single vessel was the combined work of the community, not just one person.

Yeats, William Shakespeare and classical Greek literature. Apart from his passion for literature, he loved music, was an accomplished pianist, and an enthusiastic cook. A gentle, unassuming person, humorous, warm and kind, he was a committed humanist and pacifist. He had no truck with status, celebrity or power.The Guardian, 8 January 2007 Early life and education He was born in Hove, Sussex, one of seven children of Albert James Knowland and Maria Maud Knowland (n√©e Sturley). Tony was educated at Dulwich College and later at Frensham Heights, Surrey, where he became head boy and studied Latin and Greek with Rex Warner, the eminent classical scholar and novelist. He won an open exhibition to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1938. There he read classics until the outbreak of war, gaining a 'wartime' degree. In 1947, he returned to Exeter College where he read English with Nevill Coghill, the well-known Chaucerian and Shakespearean scholar and man of the theatre. He gained a first-class degree and was invited to Toronto University as lecturer in English in 1950.Oxford Mail, 21 December 2006 Conscientious objector As a captain in the Suffolk 3rd Division of the army, Prof Knowland was involved in planning the Second Front. However, always doubtful about the legitimacy of war, he became a conscientious objector before the invasion, and was court martialled in 1944. He was represented at the court martial by Raymond Blackburn and was dismissed from the army service, but was confined to Windsor Castle for two months because of his knowledge of the invasion plans. On his release he was employed as a teacher at Frensham Heights, although within weeks as a civilian he was called up again and had to put his case to the Conscientious Objectors Tribunal at Reading where it was decreed that, having once put himself at risk of imprisonment, he should be allowed to stand down and return to teaching.Nixon-Smiths and Knowlands by Irma Knowland (1992) Magee University, Londonderry In 1953, he took up a post at Magee University, Londonderry, where he was elected to the chair of English.

The junction forms a triangular shape basin. Many of the buildings in the vicinity are Regency white painted stucco terraced town houses and taller blocks (mansions) in the same style. The area is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) west-north-west of Charing Cross and immediately north-west of Paddington. The Little Venice ward of the City of Westminster had 11,040 residents in 2015. Warwick Avenue runs through the area, which is also served by a tube station of the same name. Name Junction of the Regent's Canal, at Paddington. Engraved by S. Lacey from a drawing by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd. Metropolitan Improvements, 1828.Metropolitan Improvements, 1828, p. 201. Little Venice is a comparatively recent name for parts of Paddington and Maida Vale in the City of Westminster, which had been referred to as London's \\"Venice\\" for a century before \\"Little\\" was added. The name was in frequent use by the latter half of the 20th century. The origin of the name is sometimes attributed to the poet Robert Browning who lived at Beauchamp Lodge, 19 Warwick Crescent, between 1862 and 1887. This was disputed by Lord Kinross in 1966 who asserted that Lord Byron (1788‚Äì1824) first humorously compared the locale to Venice. The name \\"little Venice\\" was later formally applied to an electoral ward of the City of Westminster. Junction of the canals Narrowboats in Little Venice on the Regents Canal looking from the western end of the canal (which starts at the Little Venice basin) towards Maida Hill Tunnel Temporally moored narrowboats (near bank) and permanently moored houseboats (far bank) on the Grand Union Canal in Little Venice The junction of the three canals forms a triangular basin within which is a small island. The three canals enter the basin at the corners: the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal is to the west, the Regent's Canal is in the north-east corner and the short connecting canal of the Paddington Basin to the south east. The length of the sides of the basin are about from the Regents Canal to the other two corners and the length from the Paddington arm to the paddington basin canal is slightly longer at about . The basin and the Grand Union Canal form the southern boundary of the electoral ward. This means that boats moored along eastern end of the Grand Union Canal from Ha' Penny Bridge to the junction (a distance of ) are moored within Little Venice electoral ward as are the boats moored on the Regents Canal up to the western portal of the Maida Hill Tunnel (a distance of ).https://www.westminster.gov.uk/sites/www.westminster.gov.uk/files/little- venice-ward-profile.pdf Extent The boundaries of the neighbourhood of Little Venice are unclear; however, the majority of its buildings have white stucco facades characteristic of Regency architecture. This architectural style and the proximity to the canals defines the area. The name Little Venice is now being used for a wider area than previously to include new developments surrounding Paddington Basin (Merchant Square/Paddington Central). Although the Paddington Basin development is sometimes included as a part of Little Venice, the modern architectural style of Paddington Basin sets it apart from the rest of the area. The name Maida Vale is likewise fairly recent in origin. Most of the area was part of Paddington, a parish of early medieval creation. Land north of Browning's Pool was later referred to as Kilburn Fields, or as its then developed minority part of Kilburn, which by the mid-nineteenth century formed four ecclesiastical chapelries, the local two of which (one of which is relevant) had lain in Hampstead, but Kilburn had for centuries been a major hamlet.T F T Baker, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Hampstead: Kilburn, Edgware Road, and Cricklewood', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington, ed. C R Elrington (London, 1989), pp. 47‚Äì51. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp47-51 [accessed 27 January 2018]. It is generally considered the area is roughly bounded by Delamere Terrace, Warwick Crescent, Howley Place and Maida Avenue at the south, Maida Vale Road at the east, the Lord Hill Road / Formosa Street footbridge at the west and Sutherland Avenue at the north. This is the area surrounding the Little Venice basin and its canals containing the Regency-style white stucco buildings. Facilities IWA Canalway Calvalcade at Little Venice in 2005 Little Venice is one of London's prime residential areas and contains restaurants, shops, theatres and pubs. Canalside venues include the Canal Cafe Theatre, the Puppet Theatre Barge, the Waterside Caf√©, the Summerhouse Restaurant, and Cafe La Ville. In the north where the area blends into Maida Vale are three Grade II (initial category) listed pubs for their historic interiors and fa√ßades: The Warwick Castle, The Warrington, and the Prince Alfred.

It is located at 8 Wentworth Street (Maine State Route 103) in the central Kittery Foreside village, in an architecturally distinguished Romanesque Revival building built in 1889 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, with a large annex just across the street at 2 Walker Street. Architecture and history The Rice Building is located on the east side of Wentworth Street, a short way north of the main entrance to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. It is a two-story structure, built primarily out of Philadelphia brick, with granite trim. It has a hip roof, three-story tower on the right, and a main entrance set recessed under a round arch in a projecting gable section near the center of the front facade. A granite string course separates the basement from the first floor, and a band of ornamental brick separates the first and second floors. The library was established by a bequest from Arabella Rice, whose 1867 will left funds for the establishment of a library in Kittery in honor of her father, a Kittery native. A board of trustees was formed in 1875, three years after her death, and this building was completed in 1889. It was designed by Boston architect Shepard S. Woodcock, and is his only known surviving commission in the state. The building is also one of only two two- story Romanesque libraries in the state (the other is the Skowhegan Free Public Library). When first opened, its upper level housed a museum and meeting space, which was used by the Grand Army of the Republic.

In their day they rivaled the Emmy Award for prestige. They came to an end after the sponsor was merged into GTE. History Sylvania Electric Products, a television set manufacturer, gave the annual Sylvania Awards from 1951. The awards were given for advancing creative television techniques. The Sylvania Award was as prestigious as the Emmy Award in the early days of television. It was one of several developed in the 1950s after the Emmy award was founded in 1949. Others included the TV Guide Award and the Look Magazine TV Award. Ed Sullivan gave out the Michael award in Los Angeles from 1950 to 1953. In 1951 the Sylvania award for best program suitable for children was given to Zoo Parade by the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, headed by Mrs. Johnny Hays. The awards for 1953 were presented in New York on 1 December 1953, with winners announced in advance. No grand award was presented. Winners included Rod Steiger (actor) and Paddy Chayefsky (script) for Marty, Donald O'Connor, Danny Thomas and Mary Martin. The 1955 awards were presented by broadcaster Deems Taylor on 29 November 1955. Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., head of NBC, received an award. 1957 Sylvania Television Award winners included Mary Martin, Dinah Shore, Marian Anderson, Steve Allen and Jack Paar. The 1958 awards were presented in January 1959 at a ceremony in the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan attended by about 400 guests including performers and representatives of networks, TV stations and production companies. Comedian Orson Bean was the master of ceremonies. The awards were presented by Don G. Mitchell, chairman and president of Sylvania Electric Products. In 1959 Sylvania Electric Products merged with General Telephone to form General Telephone and Electronics (GTE). The awards for 1959 were the last. Trophy The award winners received a trophy in the form of a clock. A walnut wood base is decorated by a high-relief sculpture of a woman in a robe who carries the clock face on her shoulders. The face is made of glass, with etched gilt stars at each hour and stylized metal lightning bolts for hands. Some versions of the award were functioning electric clocks made by Jefferson Electric Company of Bellwood, Illinois. In others the clock hands were permanently attached to the glass face.

He is best known for playing for Leeds during the Don Revie Period. Career Bates was born in Armthorpe, Doncaster, and began his football career as an apprentice with Leeds United. Although primarily a squad player at Elland Road, not being able to break into the regular eleven due to Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles not releasing their places in the sides, Bates was still an excellent part of Don Revie's Leeds squad of the 1960s and early 1970s. Signing professional forms in 1964, Bates made 187 appearances for Leeds scoring nine goals, including one against Juventus in the 2‚Äì2 first leg of the Fairs Cup Final of 1971 away in Turin. This goal along with a 1‚Äì1 score-line at Elland Road helped Leeds to triumph in the competition with Leeds winning on the away goals rule. He remained loyal to Leeds for 12 years despite the fact he would have probably retained a regular place in most other sides. A repetition of knee injuries between 1974 and 1976 kept him out of the action for much of that time. He eventually left Leeds in the summer of 1976, going to Walsall for ¬£25,000.

Bottom: proposed structure of L1 RNA-protein (RNP) complexes. ORF1 proteins form trimers, exhibiting RNA binding and nucleic acid chaperone activity. LINE1 (also L1 and LINE-1) are class I transposable elements in the DNA of some organisms and belong to the group of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). L1 comprise approximately 17% of the human genome. The majority of L1 in the human genome are inactive; however, about 80-100 have retained the ability to retrotranspose, with considerable variation between individuals. These active L1s can interrupt the genome through insertions, deletions, rearrangements, and copy number variations (CNV). L1 activity has contributed to the instability and evolution of genomes, and is tightly regulated in the germline by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and piRNA. L1s can further impact genome variation by mispairing and unequal crossing-over during meiosis due to its repetitive DNA sequences. L1 gene products are also required by many nonautonomous Alu and SVA SINE retrotransposons. Mutations induced by L1 and its nonautonomous counterparts have been found to cause a variety of heritable and somatic diseases. Human L1 has been reported to have transferred to the genome of the gonorrhea bacteria.  Structure  A typical L1 element is approximately 6,000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORF) which are flanked by untranslated regions (UTR) and target site duplications. In humans, ORF2 is thought to be translated by an unconventional termination/reinitiation mechanism, while mouse L1s contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of each ORF. = 5' UTR = The 5' UTR of the L1 element contains a strong, internal RNA Polymerase II transcription promoter in sense The 5' UTR of mouse L1s contain a variable number of GC-rich tandemly repeated monomers of around 200bp, followed by a short non-monomeric region. Human 5‚Äô UTRs are ~900bp in length and do not contain repeated motifs. All families of human L1s harbor in their most 5‚Äô extremity a binding motif for the transcription factor YY1. Younger families have also two binding sites for SOX-family transcription factors, and both YY1 and SOX sites were shown to be required for human L1 transcription initiation and activation. Both mouse and human 5‚Äô UTRs contain as well a weak antisense promoter of unknown function. = ORF1 = The first ORF encode a 500 amino acid - 40 kDa protein that lacks homology with any protein of known function. In vertebrates, it contains a conserved C-terminus domain and a highly variable coiled-coil N-terminus that mediates the formation of ORF1 trimeric complexes. ORF1 trimers have RNA-binding and nucleic acid chaperone activity that are necessary for retrotransposition. = ORF2 = The second ORF of L1 encodes a protein that has endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity. The encoded protein has a molecular weight of 150 kDA.  Roles in disease  = Cancer = L1 activity has been observed in numerous types of cancers, with particularly extensive insertions found in colorectal and lung cancers. It is currently unclear if these insertions are causal or secondary effects of cancer progression. However, at least two cases have found somatic L1 insertions causative of cancer by disrupting the coding sequences of genes APC and PTEN in colon and endometrial cancer, respectively. Quantification of L1 copy number by qPCR or L1 methylation levels with bisulfite sequencing are used as diagnostic biomarkers in some types of cancers. L1 hypomethylation of colon tumor samples is correlated with cancer stage progression. Furthermore, less invasive blood assays for L1 copy number or methylation levels are indicative of breast or bladder cancer progression and may serve as methods for early detection. = Neuropsychiatric disorders = Higher L1 copy numbers have been observed in the human brain compared to other organs. Studies of animal models and human cell lines have shown that L1s become active in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and that experimental deregulation of or overexpression of L1 increases somatic mosaicism. This phenomenon is negatively regulated by Sox2, which is downregulated in NPCs, and by MeCP2 and methylation of the L1 5' UTR. Human cell lines modeling the neurological disorder Rett syndrome, which carry MeCP2 mutations, exhibit increased L1 transposition, suggesting a link between L1 activity and neurological disorders. Current studies are aimed at investigating the potential roles of L1 activity in various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction. = Retinal disease = Increased RNA levels of Alu, which requires L1 proteins, are associated with a form of age-related macular degeneration, a neurological disorder of the eyes. The naturally occurring mouse retinal degeneration model rd7 is caused by an L1 insertion in the Nr2e3 gene.

That sort of mentoring relationship was common for Fodor: Because of the relationships Fodor developed; his fluency in several languages spoken in Central Europe; and his encyclopedic knowledge of history, politics and personalities of the region, Fodor had a strong reputation among his fellow journalists: In 1934, Fodor and Gunther interviewed Adolf Hitler's poor relatives in Hitler's Austrian home town of Braunau, the first journalists to cover Hitler's birthplace, origin, acquaintances and relatives. Their coverage clearly showed Hitler's humble beginnings and family, in stark contrast to the official Nazi propaganda about his origins. For that reason, Gunther and Fodor were soon placed on a Gestapo \\"death list\\" and remained in continual danger as the Nazis moved across Europe.Cuthbertson, Ken. Inside: The Biography of John Gunther. Bonus Books, Chicago. 1992. Page 107.

The unit of measurement is the mƒÅtrƒÅ or 'beat', from which it takes its name. A short vowel or a pause is counted as one mƒÅtrƒÅ, and long vowels, diphthongs, or a short vowel followed by a consonant cluster counts as two mƒÅtrƒÅs. In recitation, however, 'long vowels may be pronounced as short, or short as long, in order to fit the words into the desired metre. For this reason, the mƒÅtrƒÅ count does not always correspond exactly to the written vowel arrangement.'

History In 1878 The Royal National Lifeboat Institution established a lifeboat station at Hope Cove provided by The Freemasons of England.http://rnli.org/findmynearest/station/Pages/Salcombe- Lifeboat-Station.aspx The land for the boat house was donated by the Earl of Devon. Replacement boats were supplied in 1887, 1900 and 1903 and all four lifeboats were named Alexandra. The station was closed in April 1930 by which time the neighbouring station at had been equipped with a motor lifeboat which could cover Bigbury Bay. From 1992 a rescue boat was based in Inner Hope and manned by volunteers under the management of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) as part of the Cliff Rescue Team (CRT). The decision was made in 2010 that the MCA would no longer maintain any rescue boats in the UK. Current operation The Under Secretary for Transport recognised the ongoing need for this sea rescue facility in Bigbury Bay and gave the village the opportunity to run an independent lifeboat. A public meeting was held in the village and unanimous support given to form a limited company and registered charity to achieve this. The Hope Cove Life Boat became the 63rd Independent lifeboat service in the UK and has since worked with the MCA and the RNLI to continue to meet their goal of protecting and preserving life in Bigbury Bay.

History =Operation= 1903 Ordnance Survey map; the location of the hospital is shown in the top right corner. Built in 1894, Witton Isolation Hospital was initially in a semi-rural district but by the 1930s the site was surrounded by the newly built Kingstanding and Perry Common social housing developments. It occupied the site now enclosed by College Road, Brackenbury Road and Plumstead Road. Witton Isolation Hospital was used sporadically during the 20th century, particularly during the outbreak of smallpox that occurred in the city in 1962. The last cases quarantined there were during January and February 1966, following an outbreak that originated at the University of Birmingham Medical School. Witton Isolation Hospital was eventually superseded by the UK's first National Isolation Hospital, established at nearby Catherine-de-Barnes in 1966.Catherine-de-Barnes history, access date 12 August 2015 On 4 May 1966, the last patient was discharged. During its life as a first-line smallpox hospital Witton had a resident caretaker, but on 2 May 1966 the caretaker resigned. His departure left the facility of ten buildings unguarded, except for the ten feet high perimeter wall. In the middle of 1966, local children broke in, causing some vandalism. =Disposal= Burning of the building  After the incident involving children breaking into Witton Isolation Hospital in mid-1966, Birmingham's Chief Medical Officer, Ernest Millar, was contacted by a local resident who had regularly seen the children from the top seats of a double-decker bus. Dr Millar eventually ordered the facility to be destroyed by fire and on 3 May 1967 ‚Äì chosen because the wind was blowing from the south, away from the city centre ‚Äì the buildings were set ablaze by firemen of the Birmingham Fire and Ambulance Service, under the supervision of William Nicholls, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and George Merrill, Deputy Chief Fire Officer, accompanied by representatives of the news media. All personnel involved in the operation had to wear protective clothing and be inoculated. Four tons of flammable material, including kerosene, waste oil and aluminium powder accelerants, were needed to burn the buildings, which were then empty. All windows were kept open to assist the fire spreading. A virologist from the UK government microbiology laboratories at Porton Down (then part of the Ministry of Defence), was asked to conduct tests to assess the efficiency of the conflagration. Political aftermath The affair was discussed in Parliament. Harold Gurden, Member of Parliament for the Selly Oak constituency in Birmingham, asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Julian Snow, how such a danger could have occurred in \\"a densely populated area\\", why the local residents had not been informed, whether the facility was going to be replaced and what evidence there was of the destruction of any remaining sources of smallpox virus by the fire. In his reply, Julian Snow said: =Later history of the site= In October 1967 an application to redevelop the site for housing was made to the Birmingham City Council, which was approved by the Council in February 1968.

Morphology Stomatococcus mucilaginous is a Gram-positive, coagulase- negative, encapsulated, non-spore-forming and non-motile coccus, present in clusters, tetrads or pairs. S. mucilaginous can easily be confused for the bacteria from the genera Micrococcus and Staphylococcus. One way that it can be distinguished from those two is by its strong adherence to the solid medium substrate that its colonies form. Another way is by its weak or absent catalase reaction, failure to grow on 5% NaCl media or its glucose and sucrose fermentation.Fanourgiakis, P.; Georgala, A.; Vekemans, M.; Daneau, D.; Heymans, C.; Aoun, M.

Retrieved 10 November 2015. Pathology Stomatococcus mucilaginous has been linked to Bronchiectasis, showing that an inhibition of the COX-2 inhibitor is largely related to an increased production of PGE2, which has been shown to be immunosuppressive in animal models of bacterial pneumonias and sepsis. The inhibition of COX-2 improved survival in mice, suggesting that the pathogenic effects of S. mucilaginous are related to the induction of COX-2 It is also closely associated with Bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis. Antibiotics Stomatococcus mucilaginous is resistant to the quinolone class of antibiotics, with extreme resistance to fluoroquinolones. Sensitivity, as of 2003, is still found in trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and bacitracin.Fanourgiakis, P.; Georgala, A.; Vekemans, M.; Daneau, D.; Heymans, C.; Aoun, M.

Vignale is known for his work on density functional theory - a theoretical approach to the quantum many-body problem - and for several contributions to many-particle physics and spintronics. He is also the author of a monograph on the \\"Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid\\" (with Gabriele F. Giuliani) and a book entitled \\"The Beautiful Invisible - Creativity, imagination, and theoretical physics\\".  Life  Vignale was born in Naples, Italy, in 1957 and studied physics at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, where he graduated in 1979. He completed his Ph.D. at Northwestern University in 1984, with a thesis on \\"Collective modes, effective interactions and superconductivity in the electron-hole liquid\\". He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, before joining the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Missouri in 1988. He is Curators' Professor of Physics at the University of Missouri since 2006 and Fellow of the American Physical Society since 1997.  Research contributions  Vignale is known for his contributions to density functional theory. In 1987 he formulated, in collaboration with Mark Rasolt, the current density functional theory for electronic systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. In 1996 he developed, with Walter Kohn (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1998), the time-dependent current density functional theory for electronic systems subjected to time-dependent electromagnetic fields. He is also known for his contributions to spintronics: in 2000, with Irene D'Amico, he introduced the concept of spin Coulomb drag (experimentally observed in 2005). In 2003 he proposed, with Michael E. Flatte' of the University of Iowa, the theoretical concept for a unipolar spin diode and a unipolar spin transistor.US Patents No. 6,624,490 - 6,696,737 and 6,919,213 Vignale is co- author (with Gabriele F. Giuliani) of a monograph on the quantum electron liquid,Quantum Theory of the electron liquid, Cambridge University Press, 2005 which is used by students and researchers for reference and self-study. In 2011 he published a non-technical book \\"The Beautiful Invisible - Creativity, imagination, and theoretical physics\\",Oxford University Press, 2011 which presents theoretical physics as a form of art. In the introduction to this book he writes ‚ÄúA good scientific theory is like a symbolic tale, an allegory of reality. Its characters are abstractions that may not exist in reality; yet they give us a way of thinking more deeply about reality. Like a fine work of art, the theory creates its own world: it transforms reality into something else ‚Äì an illusion perhaps, but an illusion that has more value than the literal fact.‚Äù References Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:University of Missouri faculty Category:University of Missouri physicists Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Computational chemists Category:1957 births Category:Living people ","title":"Giovanni Vignale"},{"id":"47690263","text":"is a male Japanese racewalker.

It is a subspecies of Iris aphylla. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Carpathian Mountains and Pannonian Basin. Found within the countries of Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Italy. It has curved, pointed, thin leaves, slender stem, several large flowers in shades of purple, or dark purple, or violet-blue. It is a rare plant, that is protected by environmental law in the various countries of Europe. Description Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica is very similar in form to Iris aphylla but it is slightly shorter than Iris germanica (a commonly cultivated garden iris), but which it is very closely related. It has short, tuberous rhizome, that is 18‚Äì22 mm in diameter. It has basal leaves (rising from the rhizome), that are curved, acuminate (pointed) and 1‚Äì3 cm wide. They are slightly smaller than Iris aphylla, and shorter than the flowering stem. They have 5‚Äì6 ribs, and curve outwards. It has a slender stem, that can grow up to between tall, The stem has green, (scarious) membranous, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which have a reddish edge. The stems hold 1‚Äì5 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming between March to May or between May and June. It can often the second bloom time between August and September. The flower bud leans slightly before flowering in Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica as compared to Iris aphylla, in which the stem is straight. The large flowers, come in shades of purple, or dark purple, or violet-blue. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are ovate and elongated, and 2‚Äì3 cm wide. In the centre of the petal, white beards with orange tops. The standards are elongated an ovoid, and 3 cm wide. After the iris has flowered, it produces a capsule, that is triangular, capsule, which is 4‚Äì5 mm long and 3 mm wide. The capsule contains elongated ovoid seeds. =Biochemistry= In 2010, a cytotype study was carried out on Iris aphylla, using karyotype and AFLP data analysis. It concluded that Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica was a separate species to Iris aphylla. In 2014, a study was carried out on the foliage and rhizomes of the iris, it found several constituents and terpenoids (organic compounds), including phenylacetaldehyde, eugenol, and lauric acid. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted twice, 2n=48 (as Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica) in 1983, by Mur√≠n A. & M√°jovsk√Ω J., Karyological study of Slovakian flora IV. ‚Äì Acta Fac. Rerum Nat. Univ. Comen., Bot. 30: 1‚Äì16. Also 2n=44 (as Iris hungarica Waldst. & Kit.) in 1990 by Zakharjeva, O. I., Numeri Chromosomatum Magnoliophytorum Florae URSS, Aceraceae‚ÄîMenyanthaceae. Nauka, Leninopoli. Taxonomy It has the common names of Hungarian leafless iris, or Hungarian Iris, or Iris steppe. The Latin subspecies specific epithet hungarica refers to Hungary,D. Gledhill where the iris was originally found. It was first published and described as Iris hungarica by Waldstein & Kitaibel in 'Descriptiones et ic√¥nes plantarum rariorum Hung√°ri√°√©'(Descr. Icon. Pl. Hung.) Vol.3 page 251 between 1806 and 1812. In 1909, Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica was published by Gustav Hegi in 'Ill Fl. Mitteleur' Vol.2 page 289.Andrei Aleksandrovich Fedorov (Editor) Both were then de-classified as a synonyms of Iris aphylla. Later, Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica was re-classified as a subspecies of Iris aphylla. It has not been verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service, as of 2 September 2015. It has not been recognised as a subspecies by Plant list, as of 4 September 2015. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica is native to south east Europe. =Range= It is found in the Carpathian Mountains,V√≠t Bojnansk√Ω and Ag√°ta Farga≈°ov√° on the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, and Pannonian Basin. Also along the foothills of the river Bodrog (in eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary). Within the countries of Hungary, (within the Zempl√©n Mountains, near the village of Szendr≈ël√°d, and Ny√≠rs√©g,Istv√°n F√©s≈±s ), Slovakia (or Slovak Republic), Ukraine (within the Cherkassy region,), Moldova, Romania,Gheorghe Romanescu, Cristian Constantin Stoleriu and Andrei Enea (including Transylvania,) and Italy. It is not found in the Czech republic. It is listed in a checklist of Vascular Flora in Italy, with Iris albicans, Iris bicapitata, Iris foetidissima, Iris germanica, Iris marsica, Iris pallida, Iris planifolia, Iris pseudacorus, Iris pseudopumila, Iris relicta, Iris revoluta Iris setina, Iris sibirica and Iris xiphium. =Habitat= It grows on the steppe grasslands and meadows, (including sandy and semi-dry steppes,Marinus J.A. Werger and Marja A. van Staalduinen (Editors) Istv√°n F√©s≈±s ), in rocky meadows, (on andesite, limestone and basalt rocks,), and (in Moldova) at the edge of the forest clearings. They can be found at an altitude of up to above sea level. Conservation It was listed on the European Red List of Vascular Plants as Data Deficient (DD) in 2011. It is listed as 'Vulnerable' on Red List of vascular plants of the Carpathian part of Slovakia in 2014. It is listed in the Berne Convention (1982), Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, and the Romanian Government Emergency Ordinance no 236/2000, Annex 3b. It is listed in Annex II of the FFH Directive (Flora, Fauna, Habitat), with Adenophora lilifolia, Aldrovanda vesiculosa, Angelica palustris, Cirsium brachycephalum, Iris humilis ssp. arenaria and Pulsatilla pratensis ssp. hungarica. It listed on Natura 2000, with 77 sites are designated for the species. In Romania, it is classed as 'Vulnerable', and is including on a list of protected plants. Since 2002 and 2007, there were 5 confirmed locations in Romania. It is also found within the Bicaz Gorges Haghimas National Park. In Slovakia, it is classed as 'critically endangered' CR, and it is protected within Slovak Paradise National Park, alongside other at risk species including buxbaumia viridis (a type of moss), cypripedium calceolus (Lady's Slipper Orchid), ligularia sibirica, pulsatilla subslavica, pulsatilla slavica (Slovak pasque flower) and adenophora lilifolia.M√∫zeum Spi≈°a v Spi≈°skej Novej Vsi (Editor) It is also protected within National nature reserve in Dreven√≠k, near ≈Ωehra, approximately 60 species are classified as endangered including (Pulsatilla slavica G. Reuss.), Alpine aster (Aster alpinus L.), Carpathian harebell (Campanula carpatica Jacq.), Pontic dragonhead (Dracocephalum austriacum L.), European columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris L.), Snowdrop windflower (Anemone sylvestris L.), Manchurian monk's-hood (Aconitum variegatum L.), Turk's cap lily (Lilium martagon L.), St. Lucie cherry (Cerasus mahaleb (L.) Mill.), Yellow Monkshood (Aconitum anthora L.), Bladdernut (Staphylea pinnata L.) and Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum Cass.). In the Cherkasy region of Ukraine, it is listed in the Red Book as rare and endangered species with Stipa capillata L.. It is also found within the meadows of Sofiyivsky Park. In Hungary, it is protected by law. It is threatened due to habitat loss. From infrastructure development, forestry practices (including rejuvenation of forests with spruce). Also loss by invading dominant species such as robinia and pinus species. Cultivation It is hardy to Zone 4. It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, (it can tolerate rocky soil) in a sunny situation. It can tolerate dry situations, if planted in humus rich soils. =Propagation= It can be propagated by division of the rhizomes or by seed growing. In the wild the seed are spread by the wind. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture On 7 February 1967, a stamp was issued in Hungary that shows Iris hungarica.

She was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Viennese Labour Chamber. She was detained in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp during the Nazi regime and killed by gas at the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in 1942.  Early life  Leichter was born Marianne Katharina Pick in 1895 in Vienna, the second daughter of a Jewish couple, lawyer Josef Pick (1849, N√°chod1926) and his wife Charlotte \\"Lotte\\" Rubinstein (1871, Gala»õi1939)geni.com. Her older sister was the Austrian-American composer and music therapist Vally Weigl. K√§the graduated from the Beamten-T√∂chter-Lyceum in 1914 and subsequently began studying political science at the University of Vienna. Since, at the time, Austrian women were not allowed to graduate, she transferred to the German Heidelberg University in 1917; she graduated in July 1918 before returning to Vienna to complete two further semesters at the university.  Political career  Leichter became involved in the Wiener Jugendbewegung (Viennese Youth Movement), a radical left-wing organisation, as a student prior to the outbreak of World War I, and was later a member of the Parteisch√ºler-Bildungsverein Karl Marx (Karl Marx Association for Party Scholars and Education), a Marxist group for Social Democratic Party of Austria (SDAP√ñ) members who opposed the war. When the Republic of Austria was founded in 1918, and as one of the first Austrian women political science graduates to have specialised in economics, she joined the Reichswirtschaftskommission der Arbeiterr√§te (State Economic Committee of the Workers' Councils), ' (State Committee for the Socialisation of Industry) and the Zentralverband f√ºr Gemeinwirtschaft (Central Organisation for Public Goods and Corporations), as well as working for the Ministry of Finance. Leichter joined the Frauenreferat der Wiener Arbeiterkammer (Women's Department of the Viennese Institutionalised Workers' Chamber) in 1925 and led the department until 1934. She was elected to the Betriebsrat der Wiener Arbeitkammer (Workers' Committee of the Viennese Institutionalised Workers' Chamber) in 1932. She published articles and reports based on statistical data that she gathered about women's work in Austria, and also gave lectures, school courses and radio broadcasts to advocate for women's rights. She argued for equal pay, the hiring of more women in social administration, and employment opportunities for university-educated women. Personal life Feuerhalle Simmering, Leichter family grave She married , a fellow socialist and journalist, in 1921. She gave birth to their first son, Heinz, in 1924 and their second, Franz, in 1930. Political persecution and death When the SDAP√ñ was banned in Austria in February 1934, Leichter joined the Revolution√§re Sozialisten (Revolutionary Socialists), an underground socialist organisation that had been formed in response to the party ban. She and her husband Otto migrated to Z√ºrich in exile for six months in 1934, but returned to Vienna when she was elected the Revolutionary Socialists' chair of education. She wrote anti-fascist pamphlets and published articles abroad under the pseudonyms Maria Mahler and Anna G√§rtner. After the Nazi Party invaded Austria in the 1938 Anschluss, she attempted to flee Austria with her family; although her family escaped, Leichter was arrested by the Gestapo in Vienna on 30 May 1938 and subsequently imprisoned. She was sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in 1940 and was killed by gas at the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in early 1942. An urn at Feuerhalle Simmering filled with earth from Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp serves as her cenotaph in Vienna. Legacy K√§the Leichter-Gasse, a street in the Hietzing district of Vienna, was named after Leichter in 1949. An annual prize awarded by the Austrian government to a woman historian is also named in Leichter's memory. Austrian-American historian Gerda Lerner wrote that Leichter \\"personifies the highest ideals of feminism‚Äîlifelong activity on behalf of all women, but especially working- class women; conviction that social reforms are only just if they serve the interests of women as well as men; uncompromising struggle against fascism and National Socialism, which cost her life.\\" Relatives K√§the Leichter's maternal relatives are * Jacques Rubinstein, (1841, Yareslov (Jaros≈Çaw), Royal Galicia-Lodomeria1912, Vienna, Austria-Hungary) ‚àû Henriette Rosenfeld, (, ) (1848, (, ), Nyitra Co.

The UN Conferences on Housing (Habitat) are occurring in the bi-decennial cycle (1976, 1996 and 2016). The United Nations General Assembly decided to convene The Habitat III Conference in its resolution 66/207. The Habitat III Conference reinvigorates the global commitment to sustainable urbanization, to focus on the implementation of a ‚ÄúNew Urban Agenda‚Äù. Habitat III was one of the first United Nations global summits after the adoption of the Post-2015 Development Agenda. It gave the opportunity to open discussions on important urban challenges and questions, such as how to plan and manage cities, towns and villages for sustainable development. The discussion of these questions shapes the implementation of new global development and climate change goals. In particular, the conference elaborates on Goal #11 of the Sustainable Development Goals: \\"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.\\"Wolfgang Amann & Sandra Jurasszovich, \\"Habitat III ‚Äî a critical review of the New Urban Agenda\\"; Housing Finance International, Spring 2017. Background Habitat II, the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, was held in Istanbul, Turkey from June 3‚Äì14, 1996. The conference outcomes were integrated in the Istanbul Declaration. World leaders also adopted the Habitat Agenda as a global plan of action for adequate shelter for all, with the notion of sustainable human settlements driving development in an urbanizing world. Habitat I was the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, May 31 - June 11, 1976, governments began to recognize the need for sustainable human settlements and the consequences of rapid urbanization, especially in the developing world. The conference outcomes were integrated into the Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements, which carried an action plan with 64 recommendations for National Action. The Conference also established the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements - UNCHS (Habitat).  Structure  = Secretary-General = Joan Clos, the 1997‚Äì2006 Mayor of Barcelona and Executive Director of UN-Habitat from 2010 to 2018, was also Secretary-General of the Habitat III. = Participants = Habitat III invited all Member States and relevant stakeholders, including parliamentarians, civil society organizations, regional and local government and municipality representatives, professionals and researchers, academia, foundations, women and youth groups, trade unions, and the private sector, as well as organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental organizations. About 30,000 people in total attended the conference, which was based at the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana in Quito. (Republication of \\"Here's what happened at Habitat III\\" at The Conversation.) = Road Map = The first session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom1) for Habitat III was held in New York, United Nations Headquarter, from 17 to 18 September 2014. The second session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom2) for Habitat III was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 14 to 16 April 2015. The PrepCom3 took place from 25 to 27 July 2016, in Surabaya, Indonesia. = Policy reports = The process towards Habitat III includes the elaboration of national and regional reports -that will converge in a Global Report- to provide evidence-based knowledge on the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and a comprehensive analysis on the global state of urbanization as well as good practices and tools both at the policy and intervention level. 22 stock taking papers on relevant topics, Habitat III Issue Papers, were developed through a collaborative exercise of the United Nations system coordinated by the Habitat III Secretariat. A number of official Regional and Thematic High Level Meetings involving a wide range of participants are debating priorities for the New Urban Agenda and policy recommendations in the form of a final participants' declaration. The final declaration from Regional and Thematic meetings will be considered official inputs to the Habitat III process. A total of 10 policy papers on relevant topics will be developed by Policy Units composed of 20 experts each, coming from different geographic areas and constituencies. = Engagement= The debate towards Habitat III is an ongoing process that includes past sessions of the World Urban Forums, especially the last one held in 2014 in Medellin, Colombia, and National Urban Forums to discuss and deliberate on national priority subjects including the preparation of the HIII National Reports. Beyond the governmental participation in the process through the General Assembly, the engagement to the Conference will include the General Assembly of Partners (GAP) to serve as a broad-based deliberative platform for non- governmental partners in order to develop a consensus for a joined outcome document and other related matters for Habitat III. Together Towards Habitat III campaign also promote a Global Citizenship Survey (2015/16) to embrace all contributions on the path to the final outcome of the Conference harvested through activities and initiatives to raise awareness on the New Urban Agenda. At Habitat III, SuRe¬Æ ‚Äì The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade, was presented by Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation to the broader public.http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/  New Urban Agenda  The primary goal and outcome of the conference was the agreement by UN member states on the New Urban Agenda (NUA), which will serve as a guideline for urban development for the next twenty years. A \\"zero draft\\" of the New Urban Agenda was released in May 2016 and subsequently edited. The United Nations General Assembly agreed on the final text in September 2016.Luisa Bravo & Mirko Guaralda, \\"Our commitment to implement contents related to public space included in the New Urban Agenda adopted at the UN Habitat III conference\\"; Journal of Public Space 2(1), 2017. The NUA makes frequent references to related UN agreements, including the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development passed in 1992, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015‚Äì2030), and the Paris climate agreement, all issued in 2015. The four mechanisms envisioned for effecting the New Urban Agenda are:Vanessa Watson, \\"Locating planning in the New Urban Agenda of the urban sustainable development goal\\"; Planning Theory 15(4), 2016; doi:10.1177/1473095216660786.New Urban Agenda, Habitat III Secretariat, 2017; A/RES/71/256*; ; p. 15. # National urban policies promoting \\"integrated systems of cities and human settlements\\" in furtherance of \\"sustainable integrated urban development\\". # Stronger urban governance \\"with sound institutions and mechanisms that empower and include urban stakeholders\\" along with checks and balances, to promote predictability, social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental protection. # Reinvigorated \\"long-term and integrated urban and territorial planning and design in order to optimize the spatial dimension of the urban form and deliver the positive outcomes of urbanization\\"; and # Effective financing frameworks \\"to create, sustain and share the value generated by sustainable urban development in an inclusive manner.\\" = Urban planning = Urban planning is the mechanism by which much of the New Urban Agenda can be accomplished. In particular NUA ¬∂51 calls for: > urban planning and design instruments that support sustainable management > and use of natural resources and land, appropriate compactness and density, > polycentrism, and mixed uses, through infill or planned urban extension > strategies as applicable, to trigger economies of scale and agglomeration, > strengthen food system planning, enhance resource efficiency, urban > resilience, and environmental sustainability. In ¬∂66 the parties endorse a smart city model: > We commit ourselves to adopting a smart-city approach that makes use of > opportunities from digitization, clean energy and technologies, as well as > innovative transport technologies, thus providing options for inhabitants to > make more environmentally friendly choices and boost sustainable economic > growth and enabling cities to improve their service delivery. = Right to the city = The NUA includes language about a \\"right to the city\\", a debated concept referring to popular control over urban processes, but without definite implications for who will prevail when different parties' interests are in conflict. = Financing = The NUA calls for both public and private financing. Public financing may be derived from the economic gains from urbanization, including land and property value and infrastructure projects. Development funds and development banks are envisioned as \\"intermediaries for urban financing\\". (NUA ¬∂130‚Äì153). Private funding is envisioned especially for real estate and housing; the NUA encourages > the participation of a diverse range of multilateral financial institutions, > regional development banks and development finance institutions, cooperation > agencies, private-sector lenders and investors, cooperatives, moneylenders > and microfinance banks to invest in affordable and incremental housing in > all its forms.

He was a precocious juvenile sprinter, winning the Nunthorpe Stakes against older horses as well as finishing second in the Prix de l'Abbaye, Windsor Castle Stakes and Molecomb Stakes. He was equally successful in 2008, winning the Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot before being retired to become a breeding stallion. After proving infertile at stud he returned to the track in 2009 and won the King George Stakes. He remained in training until the end of the 2016 season, winning the Temple Stakes in 2010 and 2013 and the Achilles Stakes in 2015 as well as racing prominently in many other major sprint races. Background Kingsgate Native is a dark- coated bay horse with a white star bred in Ireland by Peter McCutcheon. He was sired by Mujadil, an American-bred sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the Cornwallis Stakes as a two-year-old in 1990. The best of his other progeny have included Galeota (Mill Reef Stakes), Lesson In Humility (Ballyogan Stakes) and Masta Plasta (Norfolk Stakes). Kingsgate Native's dam Native Force won one minor race as three-year-old in 2001. She was a granddaughter of Spanish Habit, the dam of the 1000 Guineas winner Las Meninas. As a foal, Kingsgate Native was consigned by the Springfort Park Stud to the Goffs sales in November 2005 and was bought for ‚Ç¨28,000 by the Tally Ho Stud. In August 2006 the yearling was auctioned at the St Leger Sale at Doncaster and was sold for 20,000 guineas to Highflyer Bloodstock. The colt entered the ownership of the East End businessman John Mayne and was sent into training with John Best at Hucking on the North Downs in Kent. Racing career =2007: two-year-old season= Kingsgate Native never contested a maiden race, beginning his racing career in the Listed Windsor Castle Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot on 19 June. Ridden by George Baker he started a 66/1 outsider in a twenty- runner field but belied his position in the betting market by finishing second, a head behind the winner Drawnfromthepast. In July, the colt was stepped up in class for a strongly contested renewal of the Group Three Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and started second favourite behind the Queen Mary Stakes runner-up Starlit Sands. In a closely contested finish, he was beaten a neck into second by the filly Fleeting Spirit with Captain Gerrard (later to win the Cornwallis Stakes and the Palace House Stakes) in third. York Racecourse, where Kingsgate Native won the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2007 In August, Kingsgate Native was stepped up to Group One level and matched against older horses in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse where he was ridden for the first time by Jimmy Quinn. The Irish-trained four-year-old Dandy Man started favourite ahead of the Australian challenger Magnus (The Galaxy (ATC)), Red Clubs and Moorhouse Lad (King George Stakes) with Kingsgate Native starting at odds of 12/1. The other runners included Hoh Mike (Sprint Stakes), Amadeus Wolf (Middle Park Stakes), Reverence, Beauty Is Truth (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne), Desert Lord (Prix de l'Abbaye), Wi Dud (Flying Childers) and The Tatling. The sixteen runners split into separate groups across the wide track, with Kingsgate Native tracking the leaders down the centre of the course. He took the lead a furlong out and stayed on well despite hanging left in the closing stages to win by one and three quarter lengths from Desert Lord with Dandy Man taking third ahead of Red Clubs, Wi Dud and Amadeus Wolf. Interviewed after the race, Mayne said \\"It always surprised me that very few two-year-olds have taken their chance in the Nunthorpe, yet they get such a big pull in the weights... I have an excellent relationship with my trainer John Best. I keep yabbering away about form, and he just ignores what I say\\". Best said \\"I always thought he was a very good horse. The difference between a good and very good horse is in the heart and brain\\". On his final appearance of the season, Kingsgate Native was sent to France and was again matched against older horses in the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started the 5/2 favourite against sixteen opponents headed by Dandy Man, Desert Lord and the six-year-old gelding Benbaun. After tracking the leaders, he began to make progress in the last 200 metres but finished second, two lengths behind Benbaun. =2008: three-year-old season= The grandstand at Ascot, where Kingsgate Native won the Golden Jubilee Stakes in 2008 Kingsgate Native did not appear as a three-year-old until the Royal Ascot meeting in June where he contested the two major sprint races. On Tuesday 17 June, the first day of the meeting, he ran in the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs and started the 8/1 fourth favourite behind Fleeting Spirit, the Australian champion Takeover Target and Magnus. After being in contention until the last quarter mile he faded in the closing stages and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Equiano. Four days later, Kingsgate Native, ridden for the first time by Seb Sanders started a 33/1 outsider in the six furlong Golden Jubilee Stakes. Takeover Target started favourite ahead of the French champion Marchand d'Or, the July Cup winner Sakhee's Secret and the Prix Djebel winner US Ranger. The other runners included the South African challenger War Artist, Fat Boy (Sandy Lane Stakes), Sir Gerry (Gimcrack Stakes), Balthazaar's Gift (Hackwood Stakes), Seachange (a multiple Grade 1 winner in New Zealand), Astronomer Royal (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Zidane (Stewards' Cup). Sanders restrained the colt in the early stages as Fat Boy set the early pace before Takeover Target went to the front at half way. Kingsgate Native made a forward move approaching the final furlong, overtook Takeover Target 100 yards from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from War Artist. Sir Gerry took third as Takeover Target faded into fourth. Best commented \\"I thought 33-1 was a crazy price for a horse that won the Nunthorpe Stakes last year and he shouldn't have been anywhere near that price\\", whilst Sanders said that the winner \\"knuckled down and picked up really well and gave me a terrific ride throughout\\". In July Kingsgate Native started at odds of 6/1 for the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse. In a closely contested finish he finished fifth, just over a length behind the winner Marchand d'Or. A month later, the colt attempted to repeat his 2007 success in the Nunthorpe Stakes, run that year at Newmarket after the York meeting was abandoned. Ridden by Ryan Moore who became his regular jockey, he was restrained in the early stages before finishind strongly to take third behind Borderlescott and the South African mare National Colour. In September, it was announced that the colt had entered the ownership of the Cheveley Park Stud and would be retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. =2009: \\"stud career\\" and four-year-old season= In 2009 Kingsgate Native was scheduled to cover a hundred mares at Cheveley Park, but when none of the first twenty mares conceived it became clear that the horse had serious fertility problems. The stud's managing director Chris Richardson described the situation as \\"desperately disappointing for all concerned\\". Completely infertile and useless for breeding purposes, the horse was returned to training, joining the Newmarket stable of Michael Stoute. The colt made his comeback in the Golden Jubilee Stakes on 20 June and finished thirteenth of fourteen behind Art Connoisseur after being eased down by Moore in the closing stages. A month later he started 7/1 third favourite behind Borderlescott and the Greek sprinter Ialysos in the King George Stakes over five furlongs at Goodwood. The other runners included Dandy Man, Equiano, Reverence and Moorhouse Lad (winner of the race in 2007). After tracking the leaders on the near-side (the left- hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) Kingsgate Native accelerated through a gap to take the lead a furlong out won in \\"impressive\\" style by two and three quarter lengths from the three-year-old Total Gallery. After the race Richardson said \\"We were concerned having done one job, he would find it hard going back to another. It's highly unlikely he'll go back to stud duties. Michael said it took the horse four days to work out he was back in a racing yard and it has taken him this long to get his muscle tone back. But Friday's race was more like a Group One than a Group Three, so we're very pleased\\". In August the colt started favourite for the Nunthorpe Stakes but finished sixth behind Borderlescott. Richardson explained that the colt had aggravated a joint injury sustained at Goodwood and would miss the rest of the season. =2010: five-year-old season= Kingsgate Native was gelded before the start of the 2010 season. On his first appearance of the year he started joint- favourite with Equiano for the Temple Stakes at Haydock Park on 22 May. Borderlescott and Benbaun were among the opposition, as well as Total Gallery, who had won the Prix de l'Abbaye in October 2009. After tracking the leaders he began to make progress in the last quarter mile, overtook Equiano 100 yards from the finish and won by half a length, with Borderlescott three quarters of a length away in third. The gelding failed to win in six subsequent races that year but ran prominently in several major sprints. He finished sixth to Equiano in the King's Stand Stakes and fourth to Starspangledbanner in the July Cup before running unplaced in the Nunthorpe. In Autumn he finished fourth in the Haydock Sprint Cup and third in the Diadem Stakes before being sent to contest the Hong Kong Sprint at Sha Tin Racecourse in December where he finished sixth behind the South African gelding J J The Jet Plane. =Later career= The grandstand at Haydock Park, where Kingsgate Native won the Temple Stakes in 2010 and 2013 Kingsgate Native failed to win in six starts in 2011. He began the year by finishing second to Sole Power in the Temple Stakes and produced his best subsequent effort when running fourth to Margot Did in the Nunthorpe. As a seven-year-old, having moved to the stable of Robert Cowell at Six Mile Bottom, he ran four times without success. His best performance came in the World Trophy at Newbury Racecourse in September when he finished strongly but failed by a short head to catch the three-year-old Swiss Spirit. As an eight-year-old, the gelding began his campaign in the Palace House Stakes on 4 May in which he was ridden by his new regular jockey Shane Kelly. He started a 25/1 outsider but produced his best performance for some time as he finished second, a length behind Sole Power. Three weeks later he attempted to repeat his 2010 success in the Temple Stakes. Sole Power started favourite ahead of Reckless Abandon and Swiss Spirit with Kingsgate Native starting at 14/1. Kelly tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out the gelding ran on strongly in the closing stages to win by a neck and a head from Swiss Spirit and Reckless Abandon with Sole Power in fourth. After the race Cowell said \\"He is a very talented horse but so quirky, although when he is right he is right. His preparation has been awesome. Last year it was a bit hit and miss but he still showed a flash of brilliance and he has been training like a bloody good horse. And he has shown it today, I am absolutely thrilled\\". In later races that year he finished second in the Coral Charge, fifth to Jwala in the Nunthorpe and third to Maarek in the World Trophy. In the spring of 2014, Kingsgate Native finished second in the Palace House Stakes, third in the Temple Stakes and second in the Coral Charge. Unplaced finishes in his next four starts led his connections to consider retiring the horse before he ended his season in a minor stakes race at Beverley Racecourse. After struggling to obtain a clear run in the closing stages he took the lead 75 yards from the finish and won by a length and three quarters from the three-year-old Green Door. In 2015, the ten-year-old began his season as usual in the Palace House Stakes when he finished third before finishing unplaced in the Temple Stakes. A week later after his poor run in the Temple Stakes, Kingsgate Native was dropped in class for the Listed Achilles Stakes over the same course and distance. Having been held up by his jockey Graham Lee in the early stages he made rapid progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Out Do. Lee said \\"This is why we do the job ‚Äì when you meet guys like this fella. He just wants to please. It's great, and for a 10-year-old he has so much enthusiasm\\". He went on to finish unplaced in the Coral Charge, City Walls Stakes and the King George Stakes before showing better form in September when he finished second in the Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster. He began 2016 with four consecutive defeats, prompting talk of retirement, before he won a minor race at Nottingham in August. He was finally retired at the end of the 2016 season and moved to a new home at the British Racing School in Newmarket. A statement on Cowell's website stated \\"He will be sorely missed here as his antics around the yard never fail to make us laugh and he certainly still has the ability to act like a youngster and be extremely naughty at times... He has been an absolute super star and we look forward to hearing all about all the mischief he gets up to at his [new home]\\". Assessment In the 2007 International Classification for two-year- olds Kingsgate Native was rated the third-best British-trained colt and the sixth best colt in Europe behind New Approach. In the Cartier Awards for 2007 was nominated in the Champion Two-year-old Colt and Champion Sprinter categories. In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings Kingsgate Native was given a rating of 118, making him the 80th best racehorse in the world and the second best three-year-old sprinter on turf behind Overdose. In subsequent editions of the rankings, Kingsgate Native was ranked 87th in the world in 2009 and 178th in 2010 Pedigree *Kingsgate Native was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generation of his pedigree.

An abridged paperback version including eight of its thirty stories was published by Berkley Books in July 1957 and reprinted in January 1958 and January 1965. The book and Adventures in Time and Space were among the only science fiction hardcovers from large, mainstream publishers before about 1950. It collects thirty novellas, novelettes and short stories by various science fiction authors, together with an introduction by the editor. The stories were previously published from 1929-1947 in various science fiction and other magazines. Conklin did not know how to contact Martin Pearson, and used an advertisement in Astounding Science Fiction to find him to pay the royalty.

The play is a revised version of Alpion‚Äôs six-scene tragedy Vouchers (2001).  Plot  The events of the play take place at a police station in a small town near London, UK, in December 2001. Scene One: Bill Wright, a police sergeant in his late forties, is anxiously awaiting the arrival of Alma Stone, an Albanian researcher in London. She has volunteered to act as an interpreter at the interview of Leka Trimi, an Albanian asylum seeker from Kosova, who has been arrested on suspicion of theft. The conversation between Bill and Alma reveals that she suffers from an inferiority complex because of the bad press her country and expatriates receive in the British media. Bill is taken by surprise by her low opinion of her fellow Albanians. Scene Two: John, a custody officer, orders Leka repeatedly to sit down when Bill and Alma enter the interview room. Leka is profusely apologetic to Bill for having hit him unintentionally the day before during a fight that had broken out between Leka and a fellow Albanian interpreter. Leka speaks broken English throughout the scene. He is very courteous towards Alma. When John leaves the interview room Bill and Alma fail to convince Leka that Alma is Albanian. Leka‚Äôs self-esteem and his opinion of his fellow Albanians are apparently so low that he cannot comprehend that some of his compatriots in the UK are not refugees. At some point Leka compares Alma to another woman with a Serbian name, something which makes Alma very curious. She tries without success to learn from Leka about the Serbian woman. Alma could sense that Leka has perhaps a Serbian wife/girlfriend, which, in her view, is very strange considering the hostility between the Albanians and the Serbs in Kosova. John interrupts the interview to inform Bill that the Chief of Police needs to see him immediately. Scene Three: With Bill gone, Leka remains in the interview room, while John and Alma have a chat in the corridor. John is not aware that Alma is Albanian. Alma is eager to enter the interview room and ask Leka about the Serbian woman. She manages to get rid of John temporarily by flirting with him. When she is alone in the interview room with Leka, Alma asks him about the Serbian woman, but he avoids answering her questions. Always believing that she is British, Leka praises her and the British for their generosity towards asylum seekers and refugees. His speech, however, is often peppered with ironic remarks, which indicates that he is saying to her what he believes she wants to hear. Alma tells Leka she is Albanian but he does not believe her because, in his view, this is not the time for Albanians to pursue academic careers in the West. Alma grows increasingly fond of him. Their conversation is interrupted by Bill who is shocked to find her alone with Leka. John is rude to Alma when he learns that she is Albanian. Leka is traumatised when he realises for the first time that he has behaved with such humility in the presence of a fellow Albanian. Bill, Alma and John withdraw from the interview room, leaving Leka behind. John keeps guard in front of the door of the interview room while Bill takes Alma to his office telling her he will collect her personally once he has dealt with the emergency which caused him to interrupt the interview in Scene Two. Scene Four: Alma manages to enter the interview room without being detected by John. She is eager to resume her conversation with Leka but is shocked by his unexpected rudeness. Leka tells Alma that, in his view, she is a refugee and a cheat like every other Albanian in the UK. Alma resents being called a refugee saying that she is a researcher and that she has worked very hard to build her career. Leka is obviously hurt by the way he has been treated in England. His bullish and violet behaviour scares Alma but she is not intimidated by him. Leka is shocked to hear that she has ‚Äòabandoned‚Äô her son and ‚Äòruined‚Äô he marriage for the sake of her career. Leka tells her that his son and wife are in Kosova. Alma wants to learn more about them but Leka is reluctant to talk. When Alma insists to know more and urges Leka to be patient because he will soon be reunited with his wife and son he tells her that they are both dead. The scene ends with them embracing. Scene Five: Alma, slumped over the desk, appears to be resting on the chair near the door, her arm on the desk, supporting her head. In a long monologue Leka opens his heart to Alma about his own family tragedy, i.e. gang-raping and killing of his pregnant Serbian girlfriend by Serbian policemen in Kosova; witnessing the killing of his parents by Serbian soldiers; and his painful experiences as an asylum seeker in the UK. Leka also tells Alma why he shoplifted in London: A few weeks before the arrest he had gone to a pub for a drink. As he did not have enough money, he offered to pay for drinks with a voucher. A racist bartender does not accept the voucher humiliating Leka in front of some drunken louts. As Leka‚Äôs confession to Alma is over, Bill and John enter the interview room. Leka attacks them thinking they are the Serbian policemen, who had raped his girlfriend. Leka is finally overpowered and taken away while a doctor examines Alma. The scene ends with Bill looking at the tape and the audience.

Covering is the last line of defense to avoid an incoming strike and consists of putting arms and forearms up and in front of the area on the body that is being blocked. The technique of covering is widely used among martial arts and has a multitude of variations. Usage Covering is used as a defensive technique and can function on three levels of execution. The first level is for Physical Defense and is used to absorb an opponents attacks, without the use of counter-attacks or evasive maneuvers. This done by putting hands in front of ones face to cover and serve as a shield. The second level of usage is Counter Defense, which is a variation of covering that calls for the person covering to respond to the opponents' strikes with a strike while still maintaining cover on themselves. The third level of countering is Awareness Defense which is a covering usage that utilizes predicted movement to defend against an opponent using evasive body positioning and counter-attacks while maintaining a covered position. In each level of defense, covering oneself is used throughout, coupled with other evasive and countering techniques at times. Types of Covering =Boxing Cover= Covering in boxing starts in a boxing stance and, upon engaging the incoming strike, the arms and fists raise together with palms facing inwards and boxing gloves pressed firmly against the face to cover up the face and head. To protect the torso, the boxer keeps his or her arms tucked against the body and rotates the hips to protect the midsection and allow punches to slide off the body. Both professional and amateur boxers use this technique of covering. =Krav Maga Cover= The type of covering utilized in the Israeli hand-to-hand combat system of Krav Maga is based on the Counter Defense level of covering usage. This form of covering, called 'bursting' in Krav Maga, absorbs/ blocks/ deflects/ and counter-attacks simultaneously. Krav Maga covering starts in an athletic fighting stance with both arms raised, fists balled, and palms facing the body. If the opponent is delivering a straight punch, the hand that mirrors the attackers punching hand redirects and blocks the strike, while the opposing cover hand sends an identical straight punch toward the attackers head. =Keysi Fighting Method Cover= Covering in the Spanish influenced Keysi Fighting Method or KFM, utilizes the defensive covering technique in an offensive manner. KFM utilizes a double arm covering stance called The Pensador which uses the arms that are defending to strike while still maintaining the covering position in front of the face. The strikes used while in The Pensador position range from elbow strikes to punches to head-butts, with each strike executed while maintaining the covering position of the arms in front of the head.

The Pursuit of Justice. Rowman & Littlefield. p. 66. Neo-libertarianism has its roots at least as far back as 1980 when it was first described by James Sterba of the University of Notre Dame.

Inequality in Hollywood refers to the various forms of discrimination and social inequality in the American media industry. There are many branches of the media industry, such as news, television, film, music, agencies, studios, to name some of the major players. In each one of these branches, there are many instances of inequality since Hollywood formed as the entertainment hub of America in the early 1900s. People of different gender, race, and age have faced discrimination and differing opportunities since Hollywood's installation. The industry has evolved over time, but efforts are still being made today to highlight these issues and work towards making changes. Some of these responses are social movements that have been created in an effort to make changes with diversity and inclusion across the industry.  Gender inequality  Hollywood actress Geena Davis in a speech at the Millennium Development Goals Countdown event in the Ford Foundation Building in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film (24 September 2013) Gender inequality in Hollywood and the media is a long-established issue. It commonly refers to the difference in pay between men and women in the industry. Women have often been paid less than men. These is also a difference in opportunities available between genders and representation of each gender within the media. This is a list of how gender inequality is commonly manifested. = Pay Gap =  Actors vs. Actresses  Such problems can be seen in the wage gap between actors and actresses. A survey conducted by The New York Film Academy in 2014 found that the top ten male actors collectively made $419 million compared to the top ten actresses who made roughly $226 million collectively. A Forbes article in August 2017 listed the 30 highest-paid actors and actresses of that year. The highest-paid actor, Mark Wahlberg, made $68 million, more than 2.5 times that of the highest-paid actress that year, Emma Stone, who ranked at 15th highest paid with $26 million. The fourth highest-paid actress, Melissa McCarthy, earned $18 million, which ties with the 21st highest-paid actor, Chris Evans.. A study from the International Federation of Actors (FIA) found that the number of women who have an income under ¬£6,000 is 14% more than men, and the number of women who have an income of ¬£20,000 or higher is 13% less than men. The Sony Pictures hack in 2014 revealed that Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams were paid less than their male co-stars for the movie American Hustle. Each actor in the film received a certain number of points that represented how much they earned from the movie. An email from a Columbia Pictures executive stated that, \\"The current talent deals are: O'Russell: 9%; Cooper: 9%; Bale: 9%; Renner: 9%; Lawrence: 7%; Adams: 7%.\\" Although the two women were nominated for more Academy Awards than the men put together, Lawrence was originally presented with five ‚Äúpoints‚Äù while the leading actress, Adams, was presented with seven. The hack also brought forth data which showed that, ‚ÄúOf 6,000 employees, 17 of those employees were raking in $1 million or more, but only one of those $1 million-plus employees is a woman.‚Äù In some instances, male co-stars have offered to give up part of their salaries in order to ensure equal pay. During an interview, Susan Sarandon said that Paul Newman offered to give her part of his salary after learning that the actress was being paid less than he was. In 2018, Benedict Cumberbatch declared that he would not take on a role if his female co-star was not being paid the same rate.  Directors  A 2017 study found that directors linked with the top 100 movies of that year were made up of 7.3% female compared to their male counterparts at 92.7%. Across an 11-year study that included 1,100 top movies, only 4.3% of the directors were female.  Writers  Data from The Writers Guild of America, West, a union for film and television writers in Hollywood, was analyzed by Denise D. Bielby in ‚ÄúSociologie du Travail.‚Äù She states that ‚Äúfrom 1999 through 2005, the gender gap in earnings increased‚Ä¶ with women‚Äôs earnings declining by 6% (from $53,200 to $50,000) and men‚Äôs growing by 16% (from $77,500 to $90,000).‚Äù = Representation and Opportunities = When it comes to opportunities available for both men and women in the industry, there are mixed reports regarding opportunities. A New York Film Academy research study found that films with a female director exhibited a 10.6% increase in female characters on screen and an 8.7% increase when a female screenwriter was part of the project. The same study found that, \\"Visual effects, usually the largest department for big feature films, had an average of only 17.5% of women (employees), while music had just 16%, and camera and electrical were, on average, 95% male\\". Few film directors are women. Among the top 250 grossing films in 2016, only 7% of directors were female. Another study from the International Federation of Actors focusing on the opportunity of employment shows that 22% more men than women reported that they feel that they have a large choice of employment opportunities and feel that they can work regularly. Inequality in the film industry is also evident in the types of characters women portray. While men can be seen playing characters within a number of different genres, women are typically under-represented in genres such as action and sci-fi, being more commonly represented in the romance genre. The New York Film Academy 2014 poll cited above also assessed gender differences in revealing clothing on screen. The poll found that while only 30.8% of speaking characters are women, 28.8% of those women wore sexually revealing clothes compared to 7% of male speaking characters. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is an organization that lobbies the industry to expand the roles of women in film. A 2018 study from IndieWire found that Michelle William's performance of ‚ÄúAll The Money In the World‚Äù made $80 a day in per diem for the film's reshoots, while co-star Mark Wahlberg got $1.5 million from Sony. Despite being significantly represented in studio executive and producer ranks, women in the industry were intensely aware that other women on the stage had been vastly underpaid. = Social Movements Surrounding Gender Inequality =  #MeToo  In October 2017, the New York Times published an article about Harvey Weinstein, highlighting the sexual harassment accounts from many of the women actresses he worked with. Following the outbreak of this story, Alyssa Milano started the now viral Twitter hashtag #MeToo to encourage other sexual harassment victims to speak up. Several film, TV, and media production figures beyond Weinstein soon became involved in a number of latent sexual harassment accusations, including news anchor Matt Lauer, comedian Louis CK, and Disney producer John Lasseter. Investigations into Weinstein's and other high level executives‚Äô harassment cases revealed that women actresses were threatened to perform sexual favors or be subjected to lewd, gender-based comments. Tight control over networks of power and uses of silence agreements discouraged women to speak up about their treatment. Since October 2018, the hashtag has been retweeted 19 million times and has accompanied notable company boycotts and accused figures to resign or step out of the public eye.  #TimesUp  The Time's Up movement was a direct response to the #MeToo controversies in Hollywood, specifically to the allegations against Weinstein. The movement was notable for being galvanized and funded by other Hollywood celebrities, simultaneously establishing legal frameworks while raising awareness by having celebrities wear black to major Awards shows in 2018. This movement stretches outside of Hollywood and works to reach people around the world in whatever workplace they work in.  #AskMoreOfHim  This movement was generated by men in Hollywood who want to show support for women in the industry by speaking up. The movement was created in response to the #MeToo movement. The men behind the movement have the goal of speaking up more about sexual harassment when it happens and holding themselves accountable to make women more equal in the industry.  Racial inequality  = History of Racial Inequality in Hollywood = The first films to come out of Hollywood that included non-white characters were played by white actors through blackface, brown-face, and yellow face in a derogatory, intellectually demeaning manner. In America, during the 1830s and 1840s, Minstrel Shows gained popularity. These shows cast white actors to represent other ethnicities. By the 1940s and 1950s, many ethnically white actors and actresses got into the spotlight by swapping out their culturally ethnic names for more widely used industry names. Oppositely this left non-white actors out of work and cast aside. Once people of color made it onto the big screens of Hollywood by the early twentieth century, they were only granted small background roles or forced to stereotype their character to get the role. Through self-imposed restrictive laws, like ‚ÄúThe Motion Picture Production Code, Hays code‚Äù, no interracial marriage or relationship like statutes could be portrayed on camera. This helped exclude actors of color from getting lead roles, even if their female counterpart was a character of color because it would typically be a white actress in blackface. The Georgetown Law Journal of Modern Critical Race Perspectives published an article stating that ‚Äútypically, breakdowns reserve leading roles for white actors, leaving only a small number of remaining roles for non-white actors.‚Äù A 2006 study by UCLA Chicano Studies stated that \\"from June 1st to August 31st of that year...only 0.5% to 8.1% of roles were available for actors of color, compared to 69% of roles 'reserved' for white actors. Moreover, only 8.5% of roles did not designate race or ethnicity, pitting white actors against actors of color\\". Furthermore, ‚ÄúJust over a quarter (25.9% ) of the 3,932 speaking characters evaluated were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups; [74.1% were White]‚Äù According to the Writers Guild of America's 2016 Hollywood Writer's Report, race is a bigger factor in pay disparity than gender, putting minority women-even at the top levels- at the greatest disadvantage. The report also states that white men earned a median of $133,500 in 2014, whereas women collectively made a median of $118,293 and non-white writers even less: $100,649. Although the Guild declined to provide specific data for women of color, Asian writers collectively earned a median of $115,817; black writers $99,440 and Latino writers $84,200. The median earnings for Native American writers was $152,500, but there were only five employed Native scribes in 2014. = African-American Inequality = As Hollywood grew slowly at the beginning of the twentieth century, few roles were available for African-American actors. In 1915, the film Birth of a Nation was released, which has become known as \\"the most controversial film ever made in the United States.\\" The film featured white actors in blackface, and it also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan as the saviors of society. The Jazz Singer, which was released in 1927, is another example of white actors using blackface, instead of films hiring black actors and actresses These early films influenced the early growth of racism in Hollywood. Recognition for African American performances throughout the history of motion pictures is awarded less often. Hattie McDaniel was the first ever African American to win an Oscar, which was in 1939 for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the film Gone with the Wind. Steve McQueen is the only black director to win an Academy Award for Best Picture, which was for the film 12 Years a Slave. Only 4 African American actors have won Oscars for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Halle Berry is the only black actress to have won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Jordan Peele and Geoffrey Fletcher are the only black men to have Oscars for in the Best Writing categories, respectively. In 2010, Fletcher won for Adapted Screenplay for Precious; Peele won for Original Screenplay for the film Get Out, which was in 2018. There is also a disparity in the budgets and box office grosses between films with white and non-white directors, with white director's budgets being higher on average. There are other examples of racial inequality for African Americans in Hollywood beyond actors, actresses, and directors. In 2009, Disney introduced the first ever African American Princess, Tiana, in the movie The Princess and the Frog. Scarlett Johansson at the World Premiere of Ghost in the Shell; the actress received backlash for portraying a Japanese female protagonist. =Asian Inequality= There have been many instances where white actors are used in place of Asian actors. In the Marvel movie Doctor Strange, Tilda Swinton, a white actress, was cast to play the role of ‚Äúthe Ancient One‚Äù, a character that is presented as a Tibetan male mystic in the comics. Scarlett Johansson also received major backlash after playing the role of cyborg Motoko Kusanagi in the adaptation of the Japanese anime classic Ghost in the Shell. Direct discrimination to Asian Americans is also present in notable movies and TV shows such as Kung Fu. It recalled jarring memories of David Carradine from ‚ÄúKung Fu,‚Äù the 1970s television series that, coincidentally, was itself a whitewashed version of a Bruce Lee concept‚Äù. There is still reportedly hidden instances where the erasure of Asians is an acceptable practice in Hollywood. Asians make up 5.7% of characters in Hollywood. Of the top 100 films from 2015, 70 of the films had cast no female Asian actresses, and 49 of the films cast no Asian American actors at all. In addition, Asian characters have 3%-4% of roles in scripted broadcast and cable shows in the 2014‚Äì15 season. Notable celebrities have spoken on this issue. Michelle Yeoh recalls that someone said, \\"If we cast an African-American lead, there‚Äôs no way we can cast you because we can‚Äôt have two minorities‚Äù. Famous action star Jackie Chan also stated in an interview with Steve Harvey that, ‚ÄúFor the last 20 years I‚Äôm looking for some other things, but in the U.S it‚Äôs difficult. Always police from Hong Kong, police from China‚Äù. Constance Wu reflected on the importance of Crazy Rich Asians, the first Hollywood Studio film centered on an Asian American Character's story in over 25 years: ‚ÄúOur amazing director Jon M. Chu says‚Ä¶this is more than a movie, it‚Äôs a movement‚Äù. A wage gap also exists between white actors and actors of color, seen recently in the potential reboot of \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" where actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park quit because their contracts offered 10% to 15% less pay than those of their white co-stars. = Latinx Inequality = According to Nancy Yuen in her book, Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism, the population of Latinx people in the US does not reflect their representation within Hollywood. There is a huge disproportion when looking at their population in the US versus their population in major motion films and programs on TV. Although Hispanics make up 17% of the total population and are the largest population of non-whites in the US, their representation within the industry is nowhere near that. \\"Latinas/os were severely underrepresented in film and television in 2013. Specifically, Latinas/os represented only 5% of film speaking roles, 3% of cable television regulars, and 2% of broadcast television regulars. Latinas/os were underrepresented by a factor of more than eight to one in broadcast television. In 2014‚Äì2015, Latinas/os played only 5.8% of all speaking/named characters in film, TV, and streaming services. Chris Rock wrote, ‚ÄúBut forget whether Hollywood is black enough. A better question is: Is Hollywood Mexican enough? You‚Äôre in L.A, you‚Äôve got to try not to hire Mexicans.\\" In 2015, Gina Rodriguez became only the second Latina actor to win a lead actress Golden Globe Award when she won for Jane the Virgin. In her acceptance speech, Rodriguez said her win ‚Äúrepresents a culture that wants to see themselves as heroes.‚Äù Even with Rodriguez's win, Latinas/os remain the lowest represented racial group compared with their percentage in the population. \\"Blanca Valdez, who runs a Latina/o casting agency in Los Angeles, said that Latinas/os have a difficult time auditioning for roles unless the call specifically asks for ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù or ‚Äúmultiethnic‚Äù; in any case, most are secondary roles, such as a neighbor or a bank teller.\\" Yuen also highlights the lack of variation of the roles written and selected for Latinx actors and actresses. This is due to Hollywood‚Äôs tendency to create, fund and promote roles that only reflect conventionalized images of Latinx people. Latinx actors and actresses tend to get only roles that are sourced from stereotypes of who they are typically known to be yet there‚Äôs so much more to them than these few stereotypical roles reserved for them. As a result Latinx audiences don‚Äôt get to see themselves represented wholly and as broadly as they truly are outside of Hollywood. ‚ÄúPuerto Rican American actor Gina Rodriguez says: I want Latinas to look at the TV and get confirmation that, yes, we are the doctors, the lawyers, the investment bankers‚Äîwe encompass every facet of life. And the reason that‚Äôs important is because little kids look at the screen, as we did when we were growing up, and wonder, where do I fit in? And when you see that you fit in everywhere, you know anything is possible.\\" = Social Movements Surrounding Racial Inequality =  #OscarsSoWhite  The #OscarsSoWhite movement began in 2015 as a push to make the Academy Awards more inclusive and racially diverse but has since sparked a critical reexamination for representation across the media industry, which includes TV, film, broadway, music, and news. The 88th Oscar nominations released in 2015 faced backlash from the public because there was only one nominee out of the main Oscar categories who was ethnically diverse and not Caucasian. The Academy received backlash from online communities, such as Twitter, along with Hollywood celebrities of every ethnicity. The hashtag has encouraged reconstruction in Academy membership, casting decisions, and behind-the-scenes staff diversity. In a research article, Caty Chattoo noted that before responding to the pushback against racial inequality, Academy membership was 92% white and 75% male in 2016. In 2017, this changed to include 41% people of color and 46% female.  Age Inequality  Ageism is the practice of discrimination against one's age. Historically, female actresses have often faced pressure from casting directors for their ages relative to their male counterparts. Young women have often been cast with significantly older men for years. For example, ‚ÄúIn the 1942 classic Casablanca, Ingrid Bergman, 27, played opposite Humphrey Bogart, 16 years older than her.‚Äù The FIA finds that 63.8% of women in the performance industry and 51.2% of men have a career that lasts between 11 and 15 years. This difference of 12.6% depicts the number of women who have ended their careers earlier than their male counterparts. Unlike other male-dominated industries, which have seen increases in female representation in the last century, motion picture participation has increased the gender gap. A study suggests that gender participation in the movie industry is highly correlated with audience expectations of characters in preferred genres such as comedy or drama. Because these characters have remained generally consistent over time since the era of Shakespearean plays, audience preferences have been fixed on certain gender and age mixes. This has also worked both ways on gender age disparity. Although there are less roles for women as their ages increase, there are less roles for young male actors. These roles are often stereotyped based on age. Public outcry related to typecasting and age has come from a range of sources, including celebrities. At the 2006 Venice Film Festival, actress Meryl Streep remarked, ‚ÄúWhat films have you seen lately with serious roles for 50 year old women in the lead? These are roles they write for women my age, usually they are sort of gorgons or dragons or in some way grotesque.‚Äù A study in the Journal of Management Inquiry found a correlation between age, gender, and pay. The data show that ‚ÄúAverage earnings per film of female movie stars increase until the age of 34, but decrease rapidly after that. For male movie stars, average earnings per film are highest when they are 51 years of age.‚Äù These studies show a clear bias against older actresses while the salaries of men remain fairly consistent even in their old age.  Reception of Movements in Hollywood  After the #OscarsSoWhite movement, The Academy set goals to change its composition of members by 2020. The first goal was to double the number of women. As of 2019, the 91st Academy Awards had about 49% female voters. The other goal that the Academy set out to achieve was to double the number of diverse members. Currently, that number is at about 38% of the population of voters. The Academy is not the only entity making changes in Hollywood inclusion. Many actors and actresses have set goals to diversify the industry through projects. Black Panther became the most successful Marvel movie of all time, breaking many records for diverse films in the industry. Other successful diverse films include Crazy Rich Asians, Hidden Figures, Get Out, Love, Simon, Moonlight and Wonder Woman Television has also felt the effects of social movements with its programming. This is Us became the highest rated TV drama series in 2017, featuring a diverse cast working to tell the stories of all people. Grey's Anatomy is another example of a TV drama series that showcases diversity. It's the longest-running scripted primetime show to ever air on ABC, and has been one of the highest rated shows on the ABC Network consistently during that time. Improvements in the gender pay gap are also in the works. Emma Stone reported that her male costars have volunteered to cut their salaries in the past because they felt it was fair to be paid equally. In reaction to these recent developments many prominent entertainment individuals have made an effort to cast and create more diversely inclusive films. One example is actor, director, and producer Jordan Peele who has expressed his support for the need of diverse Hollywood entertainment by claiming he doesn't see himself casting any white males as the lead of any of his future films. The Evolve Entertainment Fund was created in January 2018 to provide a resource for people from under-served communities to find work in the entertainment industry. References Lawrence, Amy.

He is known for his work as principal flute of the Philadelphia Orchestra for almost 40 years, teaching at the Curtis Institute and being a guiding force in the creation of an American School of flute playing.

Randel (Ed.), The harvard biographical dictionary of music. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press but moved at the age of 4 to Honolulu, Hawaii. Here he often enjoyed diving for pennies in the harbor. He was an avid swimmer throughout his life, taught early on by Duke Kahamamoku, where learned the breath control that later served him well as a professional flutist. He began playing the flute at age 8, while simultaneously studying piano. In 1911, Kincaid went to New York, enrolling simultaneously in Columbia University and the Institute of Musical Art (later the Juilliard School), where he studied flute with Georges Barr√®re. He received diplomas in 1914 and an artist diploma in 1918, and performed in the flute section of the New York Symphony under Walter Damrosch from 1914 to 1919. During this time in New York, Kincaid served as president of the newly created New York Flute Club. During World War I, Kincaid served briefly in the United States Navy, after which he returned to the New York Symphony. In 1920, he played solo flute with the New York Chamber Music Society. Philadelphia Orchestra After Leopold Stokowski dismissed Andr√© Maquarre during a rehearsal in April 1921, Kincaid was offered the principal flute position in the Philadelphia Orchestra, which he went on to hold for 40 seasons. During his tenure, he appeared as a soloist in 215 performances by the Orchestra. He was well-regarded by other musicians in the Orchestra. He retired from the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1960 at the mandatory retirement age of 65. Curtis Institute of Music In either 1924 or 1928 (sources vary), Kincaid joined the faculty of the newly established Curtis Institute of Music, where his four decades of teaching would have a profound impact on orchestral flute playing in the United States. At Curtis he collaborated with the pianist Vladimir Sokoloff.http://www.bostonrecords.com/vladimir-sokoloff/LP \\"William Kincaid Plays the Flute\\". \\"William Kincaid (flute) accompanied by Vladimir Sokoloff\\".

Legacy  At least 40 compositions were dedicated to him, and 87% of all professional flutists living in the United States in 2003 could trace their heritage (through one or more of their teachers) to Kincaid. One such composition dedicated to Kincaid's memory by his students is Aaron Copland's Duo for Flute and Piano.

Originally created for display at the 1939 New York World's Fair, the flute was purchased afterwards by Kincaid. The headjoint sported the Trylon and Perisphere logo, symbol of the 1939 fair, engraved by Verne Q. Powell. The flute was considered so valuable that it remained under armed guard throughout the fair. Shortly before his death in 1967, Kincaid gifted the flute to his student, Elaine Shaffer. After her own death, the flute was auctioned by Christie's in 1986. The successful bidder was noted chemist, author and art collector Stuart Pivar, who paid $187,000 for the flute. Pivar was accompanied by artist Andy Warhol the day of the auction. For a time the flute was on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and was considered the most expensive flute in the world, but it was auctioned at Christie's again in 2009 and realized only $37,500.\\"A PLATINUM FLUTE, KNOWN AS THE EX-WILLIAM KINCAID, BOSTON, 1939\\" Christie's (2009).

In 2011 The collaborative aligned with Stand Up for Ohio to take a stance against Ohio Senate Bill 5 issue on collective bargaining. In 2012 The OOC developed a Civic Engagement Program that combines organizing and mobilization strategies with electoral work. The Civic Engagement Program is focused on seniors, student, and religious communities. The OOC covers six regions and 12 counties in Ohio. In May 2012 the OOC began its faith-based campaign, Ohio Prophetic Voices and formed its seed organization the Ohio Student Association.  Leadership Training In Ohio  Every year, the OOC and its statewide members host a training for approximately 100 leaders from the faith and labor community, electoral politics, public officeholders and grassroots leaders who seek to be more effective organizers in their communities, churches, or workplace. OOC's weeklong training blends the best of traditional organizing models with emerging innovation. The Ohio Student Association, a seed of the OOC is a statewide organization led by young people. OSA engages in values-based issue & electoral organizing, nonviolent direct action, advocacy for progressive public policy, and leadership development. On campuses and communities across Ohio, they organize young people to build independent political power.  Battling Mass Incarceration  The OOC and the Ohio Justice and Policy have partnered to identify a series of data-driven progressive solutions that will safely reduce the size of Ohio's correctional population while addressing serious concerns of racial disparity In the report Mass Incarceration and Criminal Justice Reform in Ohio published by the collaborative concluded racial Inequality was found within Ohio's criminal justice system. The collaborative reports that while African Americans represent 12.5 percent of Ohio's population, they simultaneously make up 45 percent of incarcerated individuals in Ohio. A report posted by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice StatisticsCorrectional Populations in the United States, 2013, provides that there was roughly 6.9 million people under the supervision of the adult correction system by the end of 2013.About 1 in 35. The United States has the highest prison population rate in the world at 716 per 100,000 of the nation's population as reported by the Worlds Prison Population List. The OOC focuses on a number of measures to address Ohio's mass incarceration including using its advocacy abilities to support and utilize the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Smart Ohio Plan which is a funding system created to increase community corrections alternatives to prison. This Plan would give counties in Ohio the ability to increase diversion program by providing funding based upon progress data and effectiveness.

Korns (1923) is a significant legal case in the US state of Ohio. It was one of the first Ohio Supreme Court cases to challenge the Ohio State General Assembly's system of school financing. Background The State Legislature's General Assembly redistributed excess tax revenues from some counties throughout the state to fund a fair and equal state school system. The plaintiff, however, claimed taking tax revenue from one county to fund another violated the constitutional requirement for a \\"uniform system of taxation.\\" That claim was rejected by a trial court; the trial court decision was upheld on appeal by The Ohio Supreme Court citing the state's constitutional requirement of a \\"thorough and efficient system of schools justified the system of taxation\\". The Miller v. Korns ruling is an historical and important decision because it defined \\"thorough\\" and \\"efficient\\"; it also authorized the practice of tax revenue redistribution throughout the state. Per Article VI of the Ohio State Constitution, the General Assembly is required to provide and fund \\"a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State.\\" In 1821 the General Assembly authorized the voluntary use of property tax revenues to help fund and support schools. In 1822 the General Assembly strengthened this practice by mandating that a portion of property tax revenues be used to fund the state's school system. During the 1850-51 Constitutional Convention, the delegates reiterated the importance of education and recognized the state's obligation, to both present and future Ohioans, to provide an educational system that allows all citizens, regardless of race or economic standing, to fully develop their potential and contribute to a flourishing society. Impacts The Ohio Supreme Court's decision in Miller v. Korns has been a tool for educational equality in the state of Ohio. It established definitions for the words \\"thorough\\" and \\"efficient\\" which have been used in later court cases. The Ohio Supreme Court established that: \\"A thorough system could not mean one in which part or any number of school districts of the state were starved for funds. An efficient system could not mean one in which part or any number of the school districts of the state lacked teachers, buildings, or equipment.\\" Miller v. Korns has since been used in Cincinnati Schools District Board of Education v. Walters (1979) and DeRolph v. State (1997) which expanded on the original decision by adding that a healthy learning environment, including teacher-student ratios, is part of a \\"thorough\\" education system.

Edible food packaging Several manufacturers are developing or producing food packaging that is edible. One example is made based on the seaweed, Eucheuma cottonii.In race for sustainable alternative to plastic, Indonesia bets on seaweedEvoware, the algae based packaging that disappears  Traditional water containers  About 50 billion single-use plastic water bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are produced in the United States each year, and most are discarded. According to the National Association for PET Container Resources, the recycling rate for PET has held steady at 31% since 2013. Polyesters like PET can be broken down through hydrolytic degradation: the ester linkage is cut by a water molecule. The reaction proceeds differently in acidic or alkaline conditions, but works best at temperatures between 200 - 300 ¬∞C. Under environmental conditions the process is undetectably slow. PET is considered to be essentially non-biodegradable, with plastic bottles estimated to take as long as 450 years to decompose. Because of this, other packaging materials are being sought. = Calcium alginate gel = Sodium alginate (NaAlg) Alginates are the natural product of brown algae and have been used extensively in wound dressing, drug delivery and tissue engineering, as well as food applications. Sodium alginate is an unbranched copolymer of 1,4-linked-Œ≤-d-mannuronate (M) and Œ±-l-guluronate (G) sugars. Sodium alginate (NaAlg) coagulates when exposed to calcium chloride (CaCl2) and forms calcium alginate (CaAlg2) and sodium chloride (NaCl), according to the following reaction: 2NaAlg + CaCl2 ‚Üí CaAlg2 \\\\+ 2NaCl = Safety and biodegradability = The biocompatibility of alginate gels has been studied extensively and their safety for consumption is well established. As natural polysaccharides resistant to breakdown by human digestive enzymes, alginates are classified as dietary fiber. Although undigested if eaten, the Ooho capsule will gradually decompose as the calcium diffuses out of the gel matrix in the reverse of the reaction above. CaAlg2 \\\\+ 2NaCl ‚Üí 2NaAlg + CaCl2 Because it is a single-strand polymer, alginate can be depolymerized (broken into smaller units) by a variety of chemical reactions. Both acid and alkaline mechanisms can break down the linkages between the mannuronate (M) and guluronate (G) monomers. Free radical oxidation is another way the alginate can be degraded in the environment. Many bacterial species produce an enzyme (alginate lyase) which can break the molecule down into single sugar components, which can act as an energy source for the organism.

Her career in British archaeology spanned sixty years, and she is recognised for her field methods, her field-leading research into prehistoric settlements (hillforts and roundhouses), burial traditions, and artefact studies (particularly Iron Age to Anglo-Saxon glass beads), as well as her high-quality and rapid publication, contributing more than 50 articles and books to her field between the 1930s and 1990s.Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).  Early life  Guido was born Cecily Margaret Preston on 5 August 1912 in Beckenham, Kent. She was the eldest of two children to Elsie Marie Fidgeon ‚Äì whose father was of independent means ‚Äì and Arthur Gurney Preston, a Cambridge-educated engineer and wealthy ironmaster, who is also recorded as of independent means at the time of her birth. The family home was a twenty-room mansion, Wood Lodge, in West Wickham. During her childhood her mother remarried, and Peggy was brought up by her aunt after her father drowned in Cornwall in the summer of her eighth birthday.  Education  As a child, Guido had an interest in Roman coins. As a young woman, she met and began excavating with Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler, spending her 21st birthday digging the Roman town of Verulamium (in 1933). Guido was particularly fond of Tessa, and spoke of her with great affection, dedicating her glass beads monograph to her memory.Prof. Jenny Price pers. comm (Department of Archaeology, University of Durham)\\" She gained her first degree (then a diploma for women) from the University of Cambridge in 1934. From 1935 to 1936, Guido studied archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology in London, where she was awarded a postgraduate diploma in Western European Prehistory. It was here that she met first husband, Stuart Piggott, whom she married on 12 November 1936.  Career  = Early interests = Guido began her archaeological career by working on the Early Iron Age. She began by writing up the rescue excavation of an Early Iron Age site at Southcote (Berkshire), which appeared in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society in 1937, and publishing the pottery from Iron Age Theale the following year. In 1938‚Äì39, she worked on The Prehistoric Society's first research excavation at the Early Iron Age type-site of Little Woodbury (Wiltshire). She worked here with Gerhard Bersu, who seems to have been as great an influence on Guido as the Wheelers. In 1939, Guido published a further Early Iron Age site at Langton Matravers (Dorset), greatly enhancing knowledge of a period that by then had only just begun to be elucidated. Sutton Hoo Helmet Reconstructed Guido was a skilled excavator and heavily involved in the high-profile excavation of the Anglo-Saxon boat burial at Sutton Hoo (in 1939) with Charles Phillips. Contemporary accounts suggest that it was Guido who first struck gold. Guido takes a prominent role in a novel on the subject, The Dig, written by her nephew, John Preston. = Bronze Age = However, Guido's own excavations mostly focused on the Bronze Age. The first excavation she directed (in 1937) at the age of 25 was the Middle Bronze Age barrow and urnfield cemetery at Latch Farm (Hampshire); its publication the following year also added significantly to the gazetteer of cremation urns known for the period.Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott, Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912‚Äì1994). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. During the 1940s, she was at the height of her productivity, producing an average of two publications each year ‚Äì often for the national journal Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, as well as for notable regional societies. At this time, she published on several important Bronze Age monument types including Bronze Age enclosures (Wiltshire), including the well-known hilltop enclosure site of Ram's Hill (Berkshire) and stone circles (Dorset), including the excavation of eighteen barrows (Hampshire and Wiltshire), as well as others on Crichel and Launceston Downs (Dorset). = Late Bronze Age = Towards the end of the war period, she turned her attention to understanding prehistoric linear earthwork sites (Hampshire) as well as producing a detailed study of the Grim's Ditch earthwork complex (Wiltshire). In the later 1940s, Guido began to focus on the Late Bronze Age period and also started producing specialist artefact reports, in particular on Late Bronze Age metalwork. Notably, she produced a comprehensive study of British razors, a report on a Late Bronze Age metalwork hoard from Blackrock (Sussex), and individual artefact studies, as well as a report on a Late Bronze Age burial at Orrock (Fife). It was at this point that she began to develop her specialist interest in glass beads. = Hillfort excavations = Guido was awarded funding in the late 1940s by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland to test the model of Iron Age settlement development in southern Scotland in response to a Council for British Archaeology policy statement regarding the misleading nature of settlement classification from surface remains. This was an early attempt to move settlement archaeology beyond typological study. In her upland excavations of Hownam Rings (in 1948), Hayhope Knowe (in 1949), and Bonchester Hill (in 1950) ‚Äì each site published in the same year it was excavated ‚Äì she tested and refined the CBA model, providing a relative chronological framework for later prehistoric settlement in southern Scotland. In the days before the application of radiocarbon dating to archaeological material, this was a huge leap forward for prehistoric studies. The late 1940s and early 1950s marks Guido as one of the most important British prehistorians. In this period, she excavated no less than six hillforts, and it was her work in the field of hillfort studies which is considered some of her most influential. Hownam Rings (1948) in particular became the type-site for hillfort development, known as the Hownam Paradigm, remaining valid to this day. In the early 1950s, Guido worked with her husband on her sixth: the site of Braidwood Fort (1951‚Äì55). = Roundhouse excavations = Beyond elucidating relative settlement chronologies, Guido's reconstruction drawing of the Hayhope roundhouse was to become the modern standard. Although Little Woodbury had been successful in exposing an Early Iron Age roundhouse, the report had been remarkably inconclusive with respect to its reconstruction. Guido simplified this in line with the earlier Northumbrian work of Wake and Kilbride-Jones, which went on to influence Brewster at Staple Howe. The Hayhope-Hownam excavations also suggested the potential for a typology of prehistoric houses ‚Äì as later undertaken by Richard Feachem and George Jobey ‚Äì both greatly influenced by Guido's work. On the strength of her contribution to British prehistory, Guido became an elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1944, at the age of 32. = 1950S and 1960s = By the early 1950s, Guido was already working towards what we now consider an understanding of everyday life in prehistory: locating the position of finds on plans and considering ritual deposits. It is in the work of Guido that we really see the advent of modern settlement studies ‚Äì through her excavation strategy and her work on hillforts and roundhouses. Between 1951 and 1953, alongside her Scottish fieldwork, she also published a series of English sites, including the hilltop site of Carl Wark (near Sheffield), excavations at Dorchester (Dorset) with R.J.C. Atkinson, and her wartime excavation of an Iron Age barrow burial (Hampshire). It was at this point that she turned her attention to wetland archaeology and arguably her most technically skilled excavation: the crannog site of Milton Loch (Dumfries and Galloway), with its well-preserved timber roundhouse (published in 1953). Guido produced one of her final field reports for British prehistory in 1954 ‚Äì a note on ceramics from a dun (on Tiree) ‚Äì in the year that her relationship with Stuart ended. She worked with him on the site of Braidwood Fort until their twenty-year marriage was annulled in 1956.Christopher Hawkes archive (Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford). She then moved to Sicily, briefly reverting to her maiden name of Preston. She used it in the translation that she and her second husband Luigi Guido made of Bernabo Brea's Sicily before the Greeks (1957). In the 1960s and early 1970s, she produced four guidebooks on Italian archaeology: on Sardinia (1963), Syracuse (1965), Sicily (1967), and on southern Italy as a whole (1972); as well as reviews of notable Italian archaeological works in the pages of the British journal Antiquity. = Glass beads = Returning to archaeology, in the 1970s, Guido settled down to researching glass beads and traveled around Britain to see excavated examples as well as those in museums. In 1978, she published her first volume on ancient British glass beads, an accomplished work covering both prehistoric and Roman periods (dedicated to Tessa Verney Wheeler) after which she began her Anglo-Saxon volume. She co-founded the Bead Study Trust (in 1981), and the Peggy Guido Fund for Research on Beads. From the 1970s onwards, she produced dozens of specialist reports on beads (for sites including Lankhills Winchester, Colchester, Wilsford, Cadbury Congresbury, Conderton Camp, Castle Copse ‚Äì with many more not yet in print). Her bead research saw her driving a camper-van across Europe during the 1980s. Her volume on Anglo-Saxon beads was published posthumously (by Martin Welch) in 1999. Both volumes remain the primary reference works on the topic. = Curator and later career = In 1977, Guido moved from Brock Street, Bath to Long Street in Devizes and became involved with Devizes Museum, now the Wiltshire Museum. At the age of 70, she turned her attention again to prehistoric field archaeology, publishing a reconsideration of the Inner Enclosure at Figsbury Rings, Wiltshire with Isobel Smith (in 1982) and conducting a fieldwalking survey of Longbridge Deverill Cow Down with Eve Machin (in 1982‚Äì83), to assess plough damage. In 1984, she was elected to the position of Vice President of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. = Legacy = Guido was a highly skilled excavator and a prolific researcher. Throughout her career, Guido's excavation methods were known as tactical and efficient, digging a site per year with strategy chosen for site objectives. Her most influential site in this respect was that of Hayhope Knowe (1949) where she opened 520 sq. m in targeted open-area trenches to investigate three houses and the enclosure sequence. This was one of the first times such an approach had been used for the northern Iron Age. Guido's method had taken the best of both the Wheeler and Bersu schools of excavation, scaled down for rapid assessment. Her archaeological career spanned sixty years and was defined by high field standards, and rapid, high-quality publication. Described as having \\"inexhaustible powers of leadership and enthusiasm\\", she had been undeterred by the demands of rescue excavation for the military. She produced as many as fifty works for British prehistory, in particular advancing the fields of Bronze Age burial traditions, Late Bronze Age artefact studies, Later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement studies (especially roundhouse architecture and hillfort chronologies), and of course Prehistoric, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon glass beads. In addition to her own research during World War II, Guido directed numerous rescue excavations for the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works, on sites commandeered for defence purposes.  Personal life  On 12 November 1936, the then Margaret Preston married her first husband, archaeologist Stuart Piggott. They had met while they were students at the Institute of Archaeology in London. By 1954 their relationship was over, and they divorced in 1956. In 1957, she married Luigi Guido; they had met while she was undertaking research in Sicily. Two years later, Luigi had a psychotic breakdown and spent six months strapped to his bed being cared for by Margaret. At the end of this period, he suddenly decided to leave his wife and moved back to Sicily; Margaret never heard from him again. In her final years, Guido regularly visited her former husband Stuart, who had retired to Wantage, Berkshire.Prof. I.B.M. Ralston pers. comm. (Department of Archaeology, University of Edinburgh). In 1987, Stuart joined Guido in shared tenure as President of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society ‚Äì offices they each held until their deaths. Guido died in a hospital in Bath on 8 September 1994. Her name lives on in the Margaret Guido Charitable Trust, by Coutts of the Strand; the Trust provides grants to charities and voluntary bodies, largely those to do with the arts. A bequest to the National Trust helped them to acquire the meadowland surrounding the monument of Silbury Hill, Wiltshire: a fitting tribute to the woman who did such an extraordinary amount to advance our understanding of prehistoric Britain.

The \\"Wild Fruits and Vegetables\\" event from Oregon Trail II is removed. This feature involves identifying which plants are edible and which are poisonous. (Incidentally, the option to \\"go look for edible plants\\" whenever someone is diagnosed with scurvy was kept.) The player can also go fishing. Updated graphics have been provided for river crossings. There are also added animated segments which follow the fictional journey of the three Montgomery children, Parker, Cassie, and Jimmy, who leave Independence accompanied by an African- American trailblazer named Captain Jed Freedman to search for the children's father in Oregon. Various points of the children's story are triggered when the player reaches a certain destination on the trail, which ranges from dangerous experiences (e.g., Jimmy is bitten by a snake) to campfire scenes in which Captain Jed would tell a story that reflects other historically accurate incidents (such as the Donner Party, the California Gold Rush, and the Santa Fe Trail). The conversation pictures are no longer animated. The soundtrack of Oregon Trail II has also been removed, replaced with a single repeating audio loop.

The type species of the family is Saurosphargis volzi, named by Friedrich von Huene in 1936 based on a single specimen collected from the lower Anisian Lower Muschelkalk of Gogolin, Poland - a section of 12 incomplete back vertebrae with ribs. The generic name of Saurosphargis is derived from Greek sauros, \\"lizard\\", and sphargis, the old genus name for the leatherback turtle, in reference to the dorsal osteoderm \\"body armor\\" and broadened ribs forming a closed chest rib basket, traits that are seemingly transitional between turtles and other reptiles. However, due to the only known specimen' destruction during World War II, many authors considered Saurosphargis to be a nomen dubium. Nevertheless, even based on surviving descriptions alone, many differences were noted even from its closest known relative at the time, Eusaurosphargis dalsassoi from the Anisian-Ladinian boundary of the southern Alps. Various hypotheses existed for the affinities of these species, and together with Helveticosaurus, they were originally thought to be placodonts, but later studies suggested relatedness to other sauropterygians and / or ichthyopterygians. It wasn't until nearly a century after the discovery of Saurosphargis, that other specimens closely related to it were found in China. In 2011, Li et al. described and named three of these specimens, Sinosaurosphargis yunguiensis, referring to this species being the Chinese version of Saurosphargis. The specimens of Sinosaurosphargis were collected from Member II of the Guanling Formation, dating to the Pelsonian (mid-late Anisian). Based on very detailed descriptions and figures of Saurosphargis in Huene (1936), and based on comparisons with the well-preserved Sinosauropshargis, Li et al. (2011) resurrected Saurosphargis volzi as a valid species, and erected the family Saurosphargidae to contain the two. Furthermore, they reported the discovery of material referable to Saurosphargis from the Lower Muschelkalk of Winterswijk, Netherlands, that is under preparation. Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis were included in a phylogenetic analysis, and were recovered in a monophyletic Saurosphargidae which was found to be the sister taxon of Thalattosauriformes. Sauropterygia was recovered as the sister taxon of their combined group, with a clade formed by Eusaurosphargis and Helveticosaurus in a position basal to it. In 2014, Li et al. described a second species of Largocephalosaurus, that was initially interpreted as an eosauropterygian due to the limited preparation of the holotype of its type species L. polycarpon. The second species L. qianensis, known from three specimens, and the newly prepared portions of L. polycarpon postcranial skeleton, revealed the same osteoderm \\"body armor\\" and broadened rib basket that are unique to saurosphargids. Thus, Largocephalosaurus was reinterpreted as a saurosphargid and a phylogenetic analysis recovered both species, forming a monophyletic Largocephalosaurus, as basal to the clade formed by Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis. All four known specimens of Largocephalosaurus came from the Luoping Biota, from Member II of the Guanling Formation, that yielded Sinosaurosphargis, alongside various invertebrates, fish, basal ichthyosaurs, Atopodentatus, and several species of eosauropterygian, including both pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurids. Phylogeny The following cladogram is simplified after Li et al. (2014) phylogenetic analysis, showing interrelationships of all known Saurosphargidae species, and the placement of the clade within Sauria. Saurosphargis was coded solely based on the holotype. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown.

She earned her Ph.D in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1919 under the supervision of Arthur Byron Coble. She became an associate professor at Rockford College and then, in 1920, an instructor at the University of Texas at Austin,. Biography on p.470-472 of the Supplementary Material at AMS where she also edited the Texas Mathematics Teachers' Bulletin. Her tenure at the university, along with that of colleague Goldie Printis Horton, is recognized by an annual lecture series.. While at the University of Texas, she met geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies.. The couple married in 1923. Their son David, who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the Drosophila laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period. The marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County. In 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago. Assisted by his wife, Carlos pursued experimental work necessary for his Ph.D. Jessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in 1940 the family moved to California, where they hoped she could recuperate. In 1942, her health had deteriorated and she was forced to enter a sanitarium, and was institutionalized at the time of her death.

History  The convent was built between 1455 and 1465 and dedicated to San Bernardino da Siena, who reputedly preached in Ivrea in 1418. The church was completed by 1457. In 1465, the original arches of the Gothic fa√ßade was enveloped by new construction, and two of the arches became part of new chapels. By the beginning of the 19th century, the convent had been requisitioned by occupying troops and by 1805, the property was deconsecrated and in 1907 made by engineer Camillo Olivetti into a residence. Between 1955 and 1958, major reconstruction modified the appearance of the convent, to house the headquarters of the social services of the Olivetti company: but restoration work was performed on the church. The church wall houses the Renaissance fresco cycle of the Life and Passion of Christ (1480‚Äì1490) by Giovanni Martino Spanzotti. The work consists of twenty scenes placed around the large panel of the Crucifixion; with central spandrels depicting the Last Judgment and Hell. The pilasters have images of St Bernardino of Siena and Christ as \\"Imago Pietatis\\", and two lateral spandrels depict the Expulsion from Paradise and Purgatory.

It contains a single species, Saurosphargis volzi. Discovery Saurosphargis is known solely from the unnumbered holotype that was housed at the Breslaw Museum, a partial postcranial skeleton that included a section of 12 incomplete back vertebrae with ribs. The specimen collected at Gogolin, Gorny Slask of Upper Silesia, Poland, from the Chorzower Schichten horizon of the Lower Muschelkalk, dating to the early Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic, about 246 million years ago. Rieppel (1995) described an isolated vertebra MGU Wr. 3873s housed at Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Wroclaw, that is possibly referable to Saurosphargis, collected from the same general location. The holotype was destroyed during World War II, and as a result many authors considered Saurosphargis to be a nomen dubium prior to the discovery of additional saurosphargid species, that enabled better comparisons with the detailed descriptions and figures of Saurosphargis in Huene (1936). Paul Albers and Li et al. (2011) briefly reported the discovery of well-preserved material referable to Saurosphargis from the Lower Muschelkalk of Winterswijk, Netherlands. The material is currently under preparation. Etymology Saurosphargis was officially named by Friedrich von Huene in 1936 and the type species is Saurosphargis volzi. The generic name is derived from Greek sauros, \\"lizard\\", and sphargis, the old genus name for the leatherback turtle, in reference to the dorsal osteoderm \\"body armor\\" and broadened ribs forming a closed chest rib basket, traits that are seemingly transitional between turtles and other reptiles. The specific name volzi honors the paleontologist Wilhelm Volz who found and briefly described the holotype of Saurosphargis and the Lower Muschelkalk of Gogolin between 1903 and 1908. Phylogeny The following cladogram is simplified after Li et al. (2014) phylogenetic analysis, showing interrelationships of all known Saurosphargidae species, and the placement of the clade within Sauria. Saurosphargis was coded solely based on the holotype. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown.

Critical response When the novel appeared in Britain in 1937 Geoffrey H. Wells, in a review in the Times Literary Supplement, wrote: The total effect is rather that of a celestial ‚Äìor demonic ‚Äì Punch and Judy show. All the characters are, by ordinary standards, grotesques, eccentric physically and mentally\\".TLS, 27 March 1937, p. 239. More recently, Morine Krissdottir, in her biography of Powys, describes the plot of Maiden Castle as \\"absurd\\" and \\"the characters over-the-top\\", while \\"the dialogue is often unintentionally comic\\". However, she still finds that the novel \\"sticks in the mind\\".Morine Krissdottir, \\"Descents of Memory, p. 313. Glen Cavaliero also recognises that much of this novel is \\"implausible\\", but he suggests that \\"it takes on a hypnotic reality in the encounters between its leading characters\\", and he also comments, that though Uryen's \\"mad quest may have its ludicrous side\\", he \\"remains an impressive haunting figure\\".Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist, pp, 101-2, 100..

He is a member of the Order of Saint Benedict Biography In September 1970, Charlesworth joined Buckfast Abbey and the Order of Saint Benedict as a novice. From 1974 to 1977, he studied at Newman College of Higher Education, a Catholic teacher training college. From 1977, he taught maths and science at Buckfast Abbey Preparatory School. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1984. Charlesworth commissioned Torbay-based theater-company Unleashed Productions to adapt the stories in Philip Yancey's book What's So Amazing About Grace? into a play, which they did and then performed at the abbey in 2010. Charlesworth commissioned a 79-year-old nun, Mother Joanna, to paint an 18 x 26 ft acrylic mural on twenty wooden panels for the abbey's restaurant, the Grange. When the mural was unveiled in April 2014, Charlesworth called it \\"a monumental effort by Mother Joanna depicting the extraordinary work of a handful of monks who built the present church on the 12th century foundations in only 32 years\\". In 2013, Alex Neil, Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport, contacted Buckfast Abbey and said that they should stop making Buckfast Tonic Wine, and Charlesworth later said to the media, \\"If you ban Buckfast, ban Scottish whisky. It's alcohol, much stronger. But oh no they wouldn't do that. So they are picking on a particular thing as a conscience salver.\\" In response, Member of the Scottish Parliament Elaine Smith said that Buckfast Tonic Wine is more problematic than Scotch whisky because of Buckfast's caffeine content. Charlesworth is one of the founders of the School of the Annunciation. In 2014, Charlesworth invited Robert Atwell, the new Bishop of Exeter, to spend some time in reflection with Buckfast Abbey's monks, and Atwell accepted. Charlesworth was succeeded by Very Rev Francis Straw OSB in March 2019, who was appointed Prior Administrator.

They released their self-titled debut EP in 2011, followed closely behind by two more EPs. Their first full-length album, Big Suspicious, was released in January 2014. In May 2015, they released the EP Never Enough, which features a cover of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" by Bill Withers and their first single \\"Strange Persuasions\\". History =Early years (to 2011)= The genesis of Wild Adriatic came about in several parts. Initially, singer and guitarist Travis Gray and drummer Mateo Vosganian were both members of a high school age pop-punk group called Horse In A Box.http://liveforlivemusic.com/features/wild-adriatic-from-moedown-to-europe/ After the band members graduated Queensbury High School in 2004, the members parted ways in 2005 and went on to form other projects. Gray would continue to tour locally with another pop-rock act and Vosganian moved to Los Angeles to continue working with college friends.Southbend Tribune, http://www.southbendtribune.com/entertainment/inthebend/eventnews/wild- adriatic-few-but-crazy/article_dcde0b6c-b82b-5458-b9fc-50e306c2a11c.html, May 14, 2015 The two ended up back in the same town of Saratoga Springs, NY shortly after Gray's band (then called Travis Gray & The Frontiers) decided to shake up their image, change the name, and adopt a more rock & roll sound, eventually becoming the band that would be Wild Adriatic.Saratogian News, http://www.saratogian.com/general-news/20130718/wild-adriatic-rock-and-soul, July 18, 2013 At the time that Gray decided to push towards a more rock and roll, band-based format, the band consisted of Gray on lead vocals and guitar, guitarist Shane Gilman, bassist Matthew Dobbs, and drummer Scott Francisco. After a trip to Italy, Gray ended up with his feet in the Adriatic Sea and that stuck with him when he returned to the US, deciding the band would be renamed Wild Adriatic. The band quickly recorded their debut EP (The Lion, released February 5, 2011), and then drummer Scott Francisco left the group. Vosganian was called in and after one rehearsal the band moved forward, playing numerous shows throughout the Albany, Saratoga, and Glens Falls regions. As writing sessions began to ramp up for what would be the band's second EP, bassist Dobbs ended up leaving the group in July 2011. After auditioning 10+ different area bassists, Vosganian found himself on a long drive with current bassist Rich Derbyshire lamenting the difficulties the band was having finding a bass player. Looking for a more serious band to work with, Derbyshire offered to learn the songs on bass and come audition the following week having never played the instrument before. =Lock & Key and Big Suspicious (2012-2014)= With Derbyshire on bass and a solid touring line-up, Wild Adriatic self released the Lock & Key EP on April 27, 2012. A busy 2012 and 2013 of touring throughout the Northeastern United States earned the band accolades from Relix MagazineRelix Magazine, http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/wild-adriatic-basement-batman-and- deadbeat-darling-at-the-merc, Sept. 12, 2012 and they were voted \\"Best Rock Band\\" by the Capital Region weekly newspaper Metroland.Metroland, http://metroland.net/2013/07/24/best-of-music-2013/, July 24, 2013 During very early writing sessions for the band's debut album Big Suspicious, consistent writing conflicts between Gilman and the rest of the group eventually ushered in a split in June 2013. Initially, the three remaining members Gray, Vosganian, and Derbyshire looked for a replacement but ended up deciding to continue forth as a power trio, with Gray picking up all of the guitar duties. After relieving Gilman of his duties, the band was left with just 4 days of rehearsal before their first tour as a trio. After expanding their touring reach to the Eastern half of the United States, supporting bands like Black Taxi, Blues Traveler, and Deer Tick, the band was invited to open the main stage at 2013's Gathering of the Vibes festival. In September 2013, the band entered Edie Road Studios in Argyle, NY to record their debut full length. A self-produced effort helmed by vocalist/guitarist Travis Gray, Big Suspicious was recorded and mixed in three weeks, assisted by longtime high school friend Jacob Lavin.

It was first published in 1585 and was one of the few works that Bassano wrote under the tutelage of Giovanni Gabrieli.Giovanni Bassano, Ricercate Passaggi et Cadentie (Venice: Giacomo Vincenzi & Ricciardo Amadino, 1585): . The book consists of four parts: the first consists of eight ricercate, followed by a number of passaggi with diminutions, then a group of ornamented cadentie (cadences), and finally two ornamented versions of the upper voice of a four-part madrigal. Each of the first three sections is presented in different modes and focuses on a different technique of ornamentation when transcribing vocal works for instruments. The book gives detailed information on the importance of a proper transcription and is meant to be played similar to an √©tude. The book purports to be playable on any treble instrument, but is most likely intended for the cornett as Bassano himself was a cornettist.Blanche Gangwere, Music History during the Renaissance Period, 1520‚Äì1550: A Documented Chronology (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004): . Print. Details The book consists of eight ricercate, forty-five passaggi with up to eight diminuiti each, eight basic cadentie (cadences), with up to ten diminutions each, and concludes with two different ornamented versions of the upper voice of Signor mio caro by Cipriano de Rore, from his First Book of Madrigals for four voices (1550). The collection is written in a late phase of mensural notation with most notes resembling the whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and thirty-second notes of modern notation. The smallest subdivision is the thirty-second note (bissicroma), a symbol that Bassano takes pains to explain in his preface \\"Ai lettori\\" (to the readers): \\"intenderete in questa mia opera quadruplicata cio√® trentadue al valor de una Semibreve\\" (\\"meant [to represent] in this, my work, a quadruplicata, which is to say thirty-two to the value of one whole note\\"),Bassano 1585, [A3]. but most modern interpretations of the piece play the eighth notes faster depending on how many are written into a measure. Usually the more eighth notes in a measure the faster they are played. =Ricercate= Each of the eight ricercate starts in a different mode but follows a structure similar to the others. The ricercate each start with slow motifs, usually outlining a triad to establish the tonic of the piece. Each piece progresses from a simple, slow melody to very fast and quick scalar runs that can span several octaves. As the runs get faster, they cadence with half-step-like trills. After the cadence, the melody starts slowly again and then quickly races back into its flashy runs until it cadences again with another set of half-step trills. This sequence will happen multiple times throughout each ricercata, and every ricercata ends with this trill-like cadence. =Passaggi diminuiti and cadentie diminuite= The passaggi diminuiti consist mainly of short but fast runs that are separated by one or more semibreves. The cadentie diminuite are similar to the passaggi diminuiti, but the flashy runs are much more elaborate and drawn out, and nearly all of them end with the same half-step cadential trills seen in the ricercate.

It is the largest one in the south of the Tyumen Oblast, and belongs to the Iset cultural and historical province. It has 177 kurgans, 55 archaeological sites of federal significance and 5 regional natural monuments. Archaeological sites in the valley date from the Mesolithic (8th-7th millennium BC) to the Middle Ages (15th century) and include marks of the Andronovo culture and Ugric (ancient Hungarians) civilizations. Some of the artifacts are stored in the State Hermitage Museum as the ; others belonged to the lost well-known private collection of Nicolaes Witsen.  Description  The Ingala Valley is located 75 km south of Tyumen, at the mouth of the Iset River. At this point, the borders of the Isetsky, Yalutorovsky, Zavodoukovsky and Uporovsky Districts of the Tyumen Oblast are closed. The valley was named in 1994 by the most common local toponyms translated from the Siberian Tatar language as scirpus. A view from a high terrace of the Iset River The valley covers an area of about 1500 square kilometres. It was formed as a result of a merger of the river valleys of the Tobol and Iset rivers. It has the shape of a trapezoid on a map, with a vertex extending to the northeast. The north‚Äìsouth length is about 55 km; on the east‚Äìwest axis it's from 20 to 45 km. In terms of relief it looks like a cavity, which is bounded on the north by a high terrace of the Iset River, and on the east by a terrace of the Tobol River. In the central part of the valley flow the and rivers, which are tributaries of the Iset River. There are two ways to the valley. The southern route is from Tyumen by the highway M51 towards Kurgan. Beyond the village it crosses the Iset River and turn left in front of the village Soloboevo, then through Malyshy and Botniki to get to Krasnogorskoe, the beginning of the valley. Then you can travel the route Krasnogorskoe-Loga‚ÄîMinino‚ÄîOnufrieva‚ÄîUpper Ingal‚ÄîNiphaki‚ÄîIngalinskoe‚ÄîLykovo‚ÄîKoklyagina‚ÄîSurka‚ÄîTyutrina‚ÄîByzovo‚ÄîUporovo; this path goes around the valley from the south-west. Then after Uporovo you may cross the Tobol River and get to Zavodoukovsk heading north through Lesnoy‚ÄîCentral‚ÄîMichurinskiy; then you come back to Tyumen by the . The northern route is from Tyumen to Zavodoukovsk by the highway P402. Before Zavodoukovsk you must turn right, cross the river Uk and continue to the right (westbound) towards Sungurovo. After Sungurovo you cross the Tobol River and reach Novolybaevo, and immediately enter the Ingala Valley. Continue by the route Novolybaevo‚ÄîKarasye‚ÄîShilikul, and from the last enter the southern route, reaching back roads through Pushkareva to Ingalinskoe (to the west) or to Koklyagina (to the south).  History of the study  The Khripunova grave field. A hole remaining after grave robbery. Belt plaque from the Siberian collection of Peter the Great The first explorers of the valley were so-called ', robbers of ancient graves. In 1669, the governor of the told tsar Alexei Mikhailovich that gold, silver items and utensils were extracted from \\"Tatar graves\\" near the Iset River. As a result of bugrovschiki most treasures of the Siberian kurgans are lost forever. In 1712, a commander of Shadrinsk, prince Vasily Meshchersky, began excavations of kurgans to get gold, silver and copper items to replenish the state treasury by order of the Siberian governor prince . During the years 1715-1717 governor Gagarin sent Siberian treasures to Peter the Great four times. 250 ancient gold jewelry pieces sent by Gagarin became known as the , which is now available in the State Hermitage at the gallery of jewels called \\"The Scythian Gold\\". Some of the treasures extracted by bugrovschiki appeared in private collections abroad. The most famous was the collection of Amsterdam mayor Nicolaes Witsen; a part of it is known only from tables drawn in the third edition of his book Noord en Oost Tartatye (1785), and the collection was lost after 1717. The first among scientists to get acquainted with findings of the Ingala Valley was Daniel Messerschmidt, whose expedition into the Siberia Governorate took place in 1719-1727. Gerhard M√ºller, who visited Siberia in 1733-1743 together with the Great Northern Expedition, stated that bugrovschiki activity was finished because the kurgans had been totally robbed. Peter Pallas during the described the kurgans Tyutrinskiy, Savinovskiy and Peschaniy-I. In 1861, published information about kurgans and hill forts of the Yalutorovsky, Tyumensky and Kurgansky Okrugs. In 1890, Ivan Slovtsov published a list of burial mounds and hill forts of Tobolsk Governorate, including information about the burial mounds Krasnogorskiy-I and Krasnogorskiy Borok, also the hill forts Zmeevo and Lizunovo (Krasnogorskoe). In 1893, became the first to discover traces of the Andronovo culture near Yalutorovsk. Studies of the valley resumed in 1959 due to P. M. Kozhin. An expedition of Ural State University (V. Frolov, T. Gasheva, V. T. Yurovskaya (Kovaleva), T. G. Bushueva, B. B. Ovchinnikova) has continued since 1962. In 1970-1980, exploration was carried out by V. A. Mogilnikov from the , and also by N. P. Matveeva, and I. V. Usacheva (Zilina) from the Tyumen State University, and by A. S. Sergeev from the . In 1994, A. V. Matveev identified natural boundaries of the valley that first allowed perceiving it as a united archaeological complex. The following year, research by the West Siberian archaeological expedition of the was begun. By Decree of the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995 No. 176, many archaeological sites of the Ingala Valley received the status of of federal importance. In 1995-2003 300 new archaeological sites were identified.  Periodization of cultural layers  Currently, these are 549 archaeological sites discovered in the Ingala Valley; the oldest one dates to the Middle Stone Age. = Stone Age =  Mesolithic  The Mesolithic is presented in the Ingala Valley with early cultural deposits of the archaeological monument \\"Ostrov-II\\". Absence of radiocarbon dating does not allow setting an age of the finds. By analogy with other Mesolithic in the south of the Tyumen Oblast (\\"Katenka\\" and \\"Zvezdniy\\"), a chronological framework of the oldest finds in the valley was limited within 8th-7th millennium BC. Artifacts of the Bronze Age. Museum of archaeology and ethnography of the TyumSU, 2013  Neolithic  The Neolithic presents with 37 sites found during excavations of the settlement \\"Dvuhozernoe-I\\", the ritual complex \\"Ostrov-II\\", and the grave field \\"Old-Lybaevo-IV\\". 6 of these belong to the Koshkino archaeological culture, 12 to the Sosnovka-Ostrov culture, 11 to the Boborykino, 3 to the Poludenskoe and 5 don't have a reliable cultural attribution. According to Eugene Volkov, the earliest Neolithic culture of the Ingala Valley should be considered the Koshkino (middle 6th millennium BC - late 5th millennium BC), and the Sosnovka-Ostrov (middle 5th millennium BC - 4th millennium BC) was the next. Boborykino culture (late 5th millennium BC - late 4th millennium BC) coexisted with the Koshkinskino and Sosnovka-Ostrov. Monuments of the Poludenskoe culture are few; perhaps they were functioning at a time when the surrounding area was empty. = Copper Age = The Chalcolithic is presented with 54 monuments, of which 28 belong to the Lybaevo culture, 12 to the Andreevskoe and 14 did not get a reliable attribution. Early Chalcolithic (the Buzan period of the Lybaevo culture) is identified with artifacts of the grave field \\"Buzan-III\\" (3190 BC ¬± 60 years), and the settlements \\"Sazyk-IX\\" (3150 BC ¬± 60 years) and \\"Lipihinskoe-V\\". The most prominent artifact of the grave field \\"Buzan-III\\" is the remains of a wooden funerary longer than 5 m found in 1996, the oldest in Northern Eurasia. Its age is comparable to Stonehenge 1, the Protodynastic Period of Ancient Egypt, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the first cities in Mesopotamia and the late period of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture. A replica of the ladya is situated now in the Archaeological gallery of the Yalutorovsky Ostrog. During the first third of the 3rd millennium BC members of the Andreevskoe culture penetrated into the valley from the Tura cultural and historical province, and until the end of the 3rd millennium BC the Lybaevo and Andreevskoe cultures evolved synchronously. Eugene Volkov calls this phase the Dvuhozerny period of the Lybaevo culture (represented by artifacts of the settlements \\"Dvuhozernoe-I\\", \\"Lower Ingalinskoe-IIIa\\", \\"Ostrov-IIa\\" and \\"Upper Ingalsky Borok-II\\"). = Bronze Age = The Khripunova grave field (Isetsky District). Alakul culture. 2014 The Bronze Age in the valley is divided into 3 stages. Early Bronze Age (late 22nd / early 21st century BC - middle 18th century BC) is represented with 7 settlements of the Tashkovo culture (a sequel of the Andreevskoe one) and 2 monuments of the Imbiryay culture. The stage of the Andronovo antiquities is presented with 13 monuments (4 both from the Alakul and Fedorovo cultures and 5 from the Cherkaskul). Opened by Axel Heikel near Yalutorovsk in 1893, traces of the Alakuls were at first considered evidence of random attacks of Alakul squads to the north. But finds in the settlement \\"Uk-III\\" near Zavodoukovsk and in the Khripunova grave field near village Krasnogorskoe discovered at the end of the 20th century forced more serious consideration of the presence of Andronovo culture in the Ingala Valley. According to Alexander Matveev, the Alakul culture consists of the following stages: Chistolebyazhsky, Alakul (developed), Kamyshinsky (late) and Amangeldinsky (transition to the Fedorovo culture). Of these there were found in the Ingala Valley monuments of the middle (the Khripunova grave field is the most northern of the Alakul cemeteries, the settlement \\"Lower Ingalinskoe-III\\") and late (the second group of burials of the Khripunova grave field, the settlement \\"Uk-III\\") stages of dating the second quarter of the 18th - middle 16th century BC. The Fedorovo antiquities are dated from the middle 16th to late 14th century BC; the Cherkaskul ones are dated to the 13th-11th centuries BC. The late Bronze Age in the valley is presented with 24 monuments, of which 12 belong to Pakhomovo culture (though it existed in sync with the Cherkaskul one), 7 belong to , and 5 are not identified. A chronological boundary of Barkhatovo antiquities (settlements \\"Schetkovo-II\\" and Kolovskiy) is from the last quarter of the 11th to the end of the 8th century BC. During the late Bronze Age construction of hill forts began in the Ingala Valley, the earliest of which is the Ak- Pash-I. The tallest of hill forts is the Lizunovo (Krasnogorskoe) in the Iset District; it is located on a promontory with a steep slope nearly 45 meters high. Its discovery began an opening of the Barkhatovo culture. = Iron Age = Kurgan Krasnogorsky-2 (Isetsky District). Sargat culture, 2014 Transition time from the Bronze Age to the Iron one is presented in the Ingala Valley with 4 monuments of the Itkul culture (late 8th-5th century BC) and 3 monuments without sustainable cultural attribution. There are 139 sites from the early Iron Age; among them 30 belong to the Baitovo culture, 16 belong to the Gorokhovo, 55 to the , 1 to the Kashino, and 37 do not have a strong cultural attribution. Baitovo tribes (7th-5th century BC) were successors of the Barkhatovo culture and coexisted with Itkul and Gorokhovo tribes, being destroyed by Sargats. The Gorokhovo people (originating in the 7th century BC) were not immediately dissolved by the Sargats and coexisted with them until the 3rd century BC. If the early stage of the Sargat culture (5th - early 3rd century BC) co-existed with its neighbors, then from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD Sargats have no rivals throughout the Middle . Kurgans in the valley are associated with Sargats (and partly with Baitovo tribes) first of all. The number of kurgans reaches 177, a diameter of individual ones more than 60 m. Many kurgans contain highly artistic artifacts made of gold, silver, gemstones and numerous decorations made in workshops of Ancient Egypt, slave-owning states of the and Central Asia. So, during excavations of the Tyutrinsky grave field near the village Suerka in 1981, Natalya and Alexander Matveevs found beads from blue spinel, which is produced only in Hindustan, Sri Lanka and Borneo, and also a miniature (less than 2 cm in length) faience amulet of Harpocrates (Hellenistic tradition of an image of the Ancient Egyptian god Horus). According to Alexander Matveev, the wealth of the Sargats' kurgans may indicate the Ingala Valley was a burial place of representatives of one or more Sargat \\"royal\\" families at the beginning of the Common Era, which had a source of enrichment from control of the supply of strategic goods along the Silk Road. A Sargat village discovered in the tract Copper Borok covers an area of 15.5 ha that makes it considered as a town. = Middle Ages = The Middle Ages is represented in the valley with 21 monuments, seven of them belonging to the Bakal culture (9th-15th century), and four belonging to Yudino (10th-13th century). Ten monuments do not have cultural attribution. It is believed that Bakal and Yudino cultures coexisted, but there is a need to justify the earlier date of the Bakal culture to fill the gap in the 300 years after disappearance of the Sargats in the 5th century.

Typical features include hipped or gabled roofs without much in the way of eaves; cladding in locally popular materials such as wood, brick or stone; small porches; and an asymmetrical design with the front door set off center. The Minimal Traditional house \\"fulfilled aesthetic and social needs for affordable single-family housing\\" and was used by the Federal Housing Administration as a prototype for a \\"minimum house that the majority of American wage earners could afford\\".

Portable sensors are specifically sensors that are easy to transport and use in the field. Sol-gel One of the primary methods of optical air sensing involves taking a sol-gel, which is made by taking a sol, a liquid with stable colloidal particles, and mixing it with a gel, which is a three dimensional continuous network encompassing a liquid. The sol-gel is then exposed to a certain indicator which becomes part of the sol-gel. Typically the production of a sol-gel follows a hydrolysis and then condensation pathway. Hydrolysis involves adding a hydrogen atom onto the gel. Condensation is a method involving bonding two different gel molecules together to create a sol-gel as a whole. This method consists of dissolving some solid into a solvent and then maintaining a basic pH as the mixture is refluxed to condense and produce a gel. One example of the sol-gel method in use today is the feeling of air acidity. The sol-gel is made with an organic dye, (2-[4-(dimethylamino)- phenylazo]benzoic acid). The dye has a pH color range of 6.7-8.7. This means that below a pH of 6.7 you see one color, in this case a red-pink, and at a pH higher than 8.7 you see a different color, in this case yellow, and you see a changing orange in between. The testing procedure is incredibly simple since all you have to do is expose the sol-gel to the air and monitor the color change. Sol-gels can also be formed into monoliths, or columns, which are larger structures of sol-gel, unlike the typical thin layer. These monoliths are shown to be better for sensing molecules with smaller molar absorptivity, which are molecules that don‚Äôt absorb into something very well. An example of a molecule that would be measured here is a metal-ligand complex. These monoliths operate in a similar method to the thin layer sol-gels in that they trap some analyte and show a color change. Fluorescence Another example of portable optical air sensors can involve fluorescence. One example of a fluorescence based sensor is an electronic nose, which can measure analytes in vapor or air. It operates so that an analyte is detected by different sensors in different ways to ensure what is being measured can be differentiated. As the vapor flows into the system it is hit with a high intensity light so that different organic dyes located in different small holes, or micropores, emit a certain wavelength and varied intensity of light based on what vapor compound they are in contact with. The light from the different sensors can then be compiled and used to determine what analytes were present. One large application of the fluorescent method is the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOC‚Äôs). Another type of fluorescent sensor focuses on metal complexes, rather than organic complexes. One example is the use of dirhodium tetracarboxylate structure to detect nitrogen monoxide, a common pollutant. This involves a nitrogen monoxide molecule coming in and bonding to the dirhodium tetracarboxylate to cause a shift in the intensity of the fluorescence of the molecule. Future The future of the portable air sensors is to design them better able to detect small amounts of sulfur and ammonia and better able to quantify the amounts that are detected. Most portable sensors are now used in conjunction with some larger, more accurate system within a lab. The advent of microfabrication techniques, microelectro-mechanical systems, energy efficient sensor circuits, and advanced computer power has allowed portable sensors to thrive, but continued advancement of those components would further advance the benefits of using portable systems.

(2014) \\"Chemical and physical transformations of mercury in the ocean: a review\\". Ocean Science, 10 (6): 1047‚Äì1063. Mercury is a toxic heavy metal which cycles through the atmosphere, water and soil in various forms to different parts of the world. Due to this natural cycle, irrespective of which part of the world releases mercury it could affect an entirely different part of the world making mercury pollution a global concern. Mercury pollution is now identified as a global problem and awareness has been raised on an international action plan to minimize anthropogenic mercury emissions and clean up mercury pollution. The 2002 Global Mercury Assessment concluded that \\"International actions to address the global mercury problem should not be delayed‚Äù.1\\\\. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Global Mercury Assessment, (Geneva, 2002). http://www.unep.org/gc/gc22/Document/UNEP-GC22-INF3.pdf (10/22/2015) Among many environments that are under the impact of mercury pollution, the ocean is one which cannot be neglected as it has the ability to act as a ‚Äústorage closet‚Äù for mercury.http://www.livescience.com/47222-deep-ocean-traps-mercury- pollution.html (09/2015) According to a recent model study the total anthropogenic mercury released into the ocean is estimated to be around 80,000 to 45,000 metric tons and two thirds of this amount is estimated to be found in waters shallower than 1000m level where many consumable fish live.Lamborg, C.H.; Hammerschmidt, C.R.; Bowman, K.L.; Swarr, G.J.; Munson, K.M.; Ohnemus, D.C.; Lam, P.J.; Heimburger, L.E.; Rijkenberg, M.J.A; Saito, M.A. A global ocean inventory of anthropogenic mercury based on water column measurements. Nature [Online] 2014, 512, 65 ‚Äì 68 Mercury can get bio-accumulated in marine food chains in the form of highly toxic methyl mercury which can cause health risks to human seafood consumers.Weiner, J.G.; Krabbenhoft, D.P.; Heinz, G.H.; Scheuhammer, A.M.; In Ecotoxicology of mercury, 2nd edition, Eds; CRC: Boca Ranton, FL, 2003; ch 16Clarkson, T.W.; Magos, L.; The toxicology of mercury and its chemical compounds. Crit.Rev.Toxicol. 2006, 36 (8), 609 According to statistics, about 66% of the global fish consumption comes from ocean. Therefore, it is important to monitor and regulate oceanic mercury levels to prevent more and more mercury reaching human population through seafood consumption.http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4883e.pdf (10/25/2015)http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4899e.pdf (10/25/2015)  Sources Mercury release occurs by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Natural processes are mainly geogenic such as volcanic activities and land emissions through soil. Volcanoes release mercury from the underground reservoirs upon eruption. Land emissions are usually observed in the regions closer to plate tectonic boundaries where soils are enriched with minerals such as cinnabar containing Mercury sulfide(HgS). This mercury is released by either natural weathering of the rocks or by geothermal reactions.Selin, N.E.; Global Biogeochemical Cycling of Mercury: A Review. Annu. Rev. Environ. Resour. 2009, 34, 43 ‚Äì 63 While natural phenomena account for a certain percentage of present-day emissions, anthropogenic emissions alone have increased mercury concentration in the environment by threefold.United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Global Mercury Assessment: Sources, Emissions, Releases and Environmental Transport (Geneva,2013) Global Mercury Assessment 2013 states main anthropogenic sources of mercury emission are artisanal and small - scale gold mining, fossil fuel burning and primary production of non-ferrous metals. Other sources such as cement production, consumer products waste, contaminated sites and chlor-alkali industry also contributes in relatively small percentages. Mercury enters the ocean in different ways. Atmospheric deposition is the largest source of mercury to the oceans. Atmospheric deposition introduces three types of mercury to the ocean. Gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) enters the ocean through air-water exchange. Inorganic mercury (Hg2+/HgII) and particle-bound mercury (Hg(P)) enters through wet and dry deposition. In addition, mercury enters the ocean via rivers, estuaries, sediments, and, hydrothermal vents etc.Mason, R.P.; Choi, A.L.; Fitzgerald, W.F.; Hammerschmidt, C.R.; Lamborg, C.H.; Soerensen, A.L.; Sunderland, E.M. Mercury biogeochemical cycling in the ocean and policy implications. Environ. Res. 2012, 119, 101 -117 These sources also release organic mercury compounds such as Methyl mercury. Once they are in the ocean they can undergo many reactions primarily grouped as; redox reactions (gain or loss of electrons), adsorption processes (binding to solid particles), methylation and demethylation (addition or removal of a methyl group). =Sedimentary Mercury= Mercury can enter seas and the open ocean as a result of the down- stream movement and re-deposition of contaminated sediments from urban estuaries. For example, high total Hg content up to 5 mg/kg and averaging about 2 mg/kg occur in the surface sediments and sediment cores of the tidal River Mersey, UK, due to discharge from historical industries located along the banks of the tidal river including industries such as historical chlor- alkali industry. Sediments along a 100 km stretch of the Thames Estuary have also been shown to have total Hg contents of up to 12 mg/kg and a mean of 2 mg/kg with the highest concentrations found at depth in and around London. A gradual and statistically significant decrease in sedimentary Hg content occurs in the Thames as a results of greater distance from the historical and current point-sources, sorption and in-river deposition in the mud reaches as well as dilution by marine sands from the Southern North Sea. In contrast sediments entering the ocean from the marsh creeks of East Coast USA and mangroves fringing the South China Sea generally have moderate sedimentary Hg (<0.5 mg/kg). Chemistry Reduction and oxidation of mercury mostly occur closer to the ocean water surface. These are either driven by sunlight or by microbial activity. Under UV radiation, elemental mercury oxidizes and dissolves directly in ocean water or binds to other particles. The reverse reaction reduces some mercury Hg2+ to elemental mercury Hg(0) and returns to the atmosphere. Fine aerosols in the atmosphere such as ocean water droplets can act as small reaction chambers in this process providing the special reaction conditions required. Oxidation and reduction of mercury in the ocean are not very simple reversible reactions.Qureshi,A.; O‚ÄôDriscoll, N.J.; MacLeod, M.; Neuhold,Y.M.; Hungerbuhler,K. Photoreactions of mercury in surface ocean water: Gross reaction kinetics and possible pathways. Environ. Sci. Technol., 2010, 44 (2), 644 ‚Äì 649 Shown below is the proposed pathway of ocean aerosol mercuric photochemistry suggesting that it occurs through a reactive intermediate: Photo oxidation is suspected to be driven by OH. radical and reduction is driven by wind and surface layer disturbances. In the dark, mercury redox reactions continue due to microbial activity. The biological transformations are different and have a smaller rate compared to sunlight driven processes above. Inorganic mercury Hg2+ and methyl mercury has the ability to get adsorbed in to particles. A positive correlation of binding is observed for the amount of organic matter vs. the concentration of these mercury species showing that most of them bind to organic matter.13\\\\. Boszke, L.; Glosinska, G.; Siepak, J.; Some aspects of speciation of mercury in a water environment. Pol. J. Environ. Stud. 2002, 11 (4), 285 ‚Äì 298 This phenomenon can determine the bioavailability and toxicity of mercury in the ocean. Some methyl mercury is released to the ocean through river run-off. However, most of the methyl mercury found in the ocean is produced in ‚Äìsitu (inside the ocean itself). Methylation of inorganic mercury can occur via biotic and abiotic pathways. However, biotic pathways are more predominant. The reactions illustrated in a simplified scheme below are actually parts of complex enzyme driven metabolic pathways taking place inside microbial cells. In abiotic reactions, humic substances act as methylating agents and therefore this process occurs at shallow sea levels where decomposing organic matter is available to combine with inorganic mercury Hg2+.9 Mercury methylation studies in Polar Regions have also shown a positive correlation between methylation and chlorophyll content in water showing there could also be biogenic pathways for methyl mercury production.Kirk, J.L.; Lehnherr, I.; Anderson, M.; Braune, B.M.; Chan, L.; Dastoor, A.P.; Dunford, D.; Gleason, A.L.; Loseto, L.L.; Steffen, A.; St Louis, V.L.; Mercury in arctic marine ecosystems: sources, pathways and exposure. Environ. Res. 2012, 119, 64 -87 Dimethyl mercury degradation also produces some of the methyl mercury present ocean. Produced methyl mercury gets accumulated in microbes. Due to the high permeability and absence of degradation for methyl mercury in other species that depend on those microbes, this very toxic compound gets biomagnified through marine food chains to the top predators. Human population consumes many types of marine fish who are top predators in the food chains which puts their health in great danger. Therefore, finding possible solutions to minimize further mercury emissions and cleaning up the already existing mercury pollution is extremely important.  Health risks  Oceanic mercury pollution presents a serious threat to human health. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that mercury consumption by people of all ages can result in loss of peripheral vision, weakened muscles, impairment of hearing and speech, and deteriorated movement coordination. Infants and developing children face even more serious health risks because mercury exposure inhibits proper brain and nervous system development, damaging memory, cognitive thinking, language abilities, attention, and fine motor skills. The case of Minamata disease that occurred in Minamata Bay, Japan in the 1950s demonstrated the frightening effects of exposure to extremely high concentrations of mercury. Adult patients experienced extreme salivation, limb deformity, and irreversible dysarthria and intelligence loss. In children and fetuses (exposed to mercury through the mother's consumption of contaminated seafood), extensive brain lesions were observed and the patients experienced more serious effects like cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and primitive reflexes. In order to avoid the toxic effects of mercury exposure, the United States EPA advises a mercury dose limit of 0.1 ¬µg/kg/day. In addition to human health, animal health is also seriously threatened by mercury pollution in the ocean. The effects of high mercury levels on animal health were revealed by the severe mercury poisoning in Minamata Bay in which many animals exhibited extremely strange behaviors and high mortality rates after consuming contaminated seafood or absorbing mercury from the seawater. The cat population essentially disappeared due to cats drowning in the ocean and simply collapsing dead and it became commonplace to witness birds falling out of the sky and fish swimming in circles. Prevention and remedy Cleaning up the existing mercury pollution could be a tedious process. Nevertheless, there is some promising ongoing research bringing hope to the challenging task. One such research is based on nanotechnology. It uses synthesized aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3) mimicking the coral structures. These structures absorb heavy metal toxins effectively due to high surface/volume ratio and the quality of surface. In nature, it has been long observed corals can absorb heavy metal ions due to its surface structure and this new technique has used to nanotechnology to create ‚Äúsynthetic corals‚Äù which may help clean mercury in the ocean.X. Wang et al. / J. Colloid Interface Sci., 2015, 453, pp 244-251http://webnesday.com/this-fake-coral-sucks-up-mercury-pollution-for-a- cleaner-ocean/ (September, 2015) The reactions involved in synthesizing this material are; Another novel material (Patent application: PCT/US15/55205) is still under investigation which looks at the possibility of cleaning mercury pollution using orange peels as raw material. This technology produces sulfur limonene polysulphide (proposed material) using sulfur and limonene. Using industrial byproducts to manufacture this polymer makes it a highly sustainable approach. The scientists say 50% of the mercury content could be reduced with a single treatment using this polymer.https://theconversation.com/we-created-a-new-material-from-orange- peel-that-can-clean-up-mercury-pollution-49355 (10/25/2015) In addition to the cleaning processes, minimizing usage of coal power and shifting to cleaner energy sources, reducing small scale artisanal gold mining, proper treatment of industrial mercury waste, and implementation of policies are sound approaches to reduce mercury emissions in the long term-large scale plan. Public awareness is critical in achieving this goal. Proper disposal of mercury containing items such as medicinal packaging and thermometers, using mercury-free bulbs and batteries, buying consumer products with zero or minimum mercury emission to the environment can make a significant difference in recovering world‚Äôs ecosystems from mercury pollution leaving minimum legacy of mercury pollution in the ocean for our future generations.

They are straight or curved rods about 2.5-3.5 micrometers in length and 0.4-0.5 micrometers in width. D. atlanticum are a motile bacteria by flagella. These bacteria can occur in pairs, alone, or in chains of 5 to 6 bacteria long. They can use hydrogen as their electron donor and nitrate or sulphur as the electron acceptor. D. atlanticum can grow at temperatures between 50 ¬∞C and 80 ¬∞C, while optimal temperatures range between 70¬∞ and 75 ¬∞C. These bacteria can grow at pH ranges between 5 and 7.5, however preferred growth is at a pH of 6-6.2. D. atlanticum prefers low NaCl concentrations for optimal growth. Growth is also inhibited by several antibiotics, including: chloramphenicol, penicillin G and rifampicin. Significance in Research Desulfurobacterium atlanticum (strain SL22T) was isolated from deep sea vents in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and used to propose a new bacterial family. To determine its taxonomic status, 16S rRNA gene sequences of D. atlanticum were compared with several other bacterial species from the genus Desulfurobacterium. Compared to three closely related strains, D. atlanticum was sufficiently distinct to warrant status as a new species. Comparisons were made based on pH, morphology, optimal temperature growth, fatty acid composition, as well as their phylogenetic position and relationships to other bacteria.

She was defeated by Democratic challenger Elwood Caudill Jr. in the November 6, 2018 election and vacated the office on January 7, 2019. Davis was elected Rowan County Clerk in 2014. The following year, the Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, and all county clerks in Kentucky were ordered to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Citing personal religious objections to same-sex marriage, Davis began denying marriage licenses to all couples to avoid issuing them to same-sex couples. A lawsuit, Miller v. Davis, was filed, and Davis was ordered by the U.S. District Court to start issuing marriage licenses. She appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the application to appeal was denied. Davis continued to defy the court order by refusing to issue marriage licenses \\"under God's authority\\"; she was ultimately jailed for contempt of court after refusing to issue the marriage licenses while also refusing to stand by and allow her deputies to issue the licenses. Davis was released after five days in jail under the condition that she not interfere with the efforts of her deputy clerks, who had begun issuing marriage licenses to all couples in her absence. Davis then modified the Kentucky marriage licenses used in her office so that they no longer mentioned her name. Davis's actions drew strong and mixed reactions from prominent politicians, legal experts, and religious leaders. Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan described Davis as \\"the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate\\", while law professor Eugene Volokh maintained that an employer must try to accommodate religious employees' beliefs. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said that Davis's imprisonment was part of the \\"criminalization of Christianity\\", while Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin compared Davis's refusal to obey the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's \\"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\\" in 1963. A few weeks after her release from jail, Davis met with Pope Francis in Washington, D.C. The Holy See Press Office later noted that the pope met with many others and said that the meeting was not a form of support for Davis's actions. Davis has been satirized in popular culture; she was parodied in a Funny or Die video, as well as on Saturday Night Live. Career =Chief deputy clerk: 1991‚Äì2015= Kim Davis was born on September 17, 1965, in Jackson, Kentucky. By 1991, she was serving as chief deputy clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, reporting to her mother, Rowan County Clerk Jean W. Bailey. Davis's 2011 compensation was in wages with an additional in overtime and other compensation. She earned more than other chief deputies in the county, and some county employees and residents complained to the county's governing body, the Fiscal Court, that the clerk's staff's wages were too high, with total compensation for five employees being about $198,000. The Fiscal Court then voted to cut the 2012 budget for wages from $300,000 to $200,000. =County clerk: 2015‚Äì2019= After her mother announced she would not run for re-election in 2014, Davis filed as a Democratic candidate for county clerk. At a candidates' forum, Davis stated she felt she was best qualified for the position because of her 26 years of experience in the clerk's office. Davis narrowly won the Democratic primary election, defeating Elwood Caudill Jr., a deputy clerk in the Rowan County property valuation administrator's office, by 23 votes and advancing to the general election against Republican John Cox. Davis won the election, with Cox subsequently alleging that nepotism was to blame for his loss. After winning the race, Davis told The Morehead News, \\"My words can never express the appreciation but I promise to each and every one that I will be the very best working clerk that I can be and will be a good steward of their tax dollars and follow the statutes of this office to the letter.\\" Davis took the oath of office as the county clerk of Rowan County on , 2015, beginning a four-year term slated to end on , 2019. As clerk in 2015, Davis received an annual salary of . Same-sex marriage license controversy =Background= On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges, holding that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately. =Davis's reaction to same-sex marriage ruling= Davis asks for the video camera to be turned off as she refuses David Ermold and David Moore (pictured) a marriage license. Release of the video ignited national controversy. Davis contacted Beshear, asking for an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight. The Family Foundation of Kentucky, a local political organization, held a protest rally against the ruling at the State Capitol in Frankfort on August 22, 2015, attended by several thousand people. The clerks of the two other Kentucky counties declined to speak to the rally crowd, but Davis spoke briefly, saying, \\"I need your prayers ... to continue to stand firm in what we believe.\\" At a competing event several blocks away organized by the Fairness Campaign of Louisville, attendees celebrated the Supreme Court's decision and called upon government officials to uphold the law. Rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Davis began denying marriage licenses to all couples. =Lawsuits against Davis= Six couples who were denied marriage licenses from Davis sued her in her official capacity as county clerk. Four couples were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Kentucky and two couples each had separate legal representation. The four couples represented by the ACLU, two same-sex couples and two opposite-sex couples, filed the first lawsuit against Davis (Miller v. Davis) on July 2, 2015. On July 10, 2015, David Ermold and David Moore (who had shot the viral video) next filed suit against Davis, represented by Joseph Buckles and Thomas Szczygielski (Ermold v. Davis); James Yates and William Smith Jr., represented by Rene Heinrich of the Heinrich Firm PLLC and Kash Stilz of Roush & Stilz PSC, filed a suit against Davis on August 25, 2015 (Yates v. Davis). Federal district judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, the judge assigned to the cases, held hearings with Davis in Ashland, at which she was the only witness. Davis argued tearfully that issuing licenses under her name violated her beliefs, citing her religious rights under the First Amendment: \\"It wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment decision\\", she said. \\"It was thought out, and I sought God on it.\\" Davis had already decided against resigning from her post, as doing so, she said, would only leave the matter to her deputies: \\"If I resign, I solve nothing. It helps nobody.\\" Governor Beshear stated that he would not call a special session of the General Assembly to address Davis's concerns, while other state legislators believed that such a session could accommodate Davis with possible new legislation. Davis's attorneys, from the Maitland, Florida-based law firm Liberty Counsel, stated that the plaintiffs were free to drive to other counties to obtain their same-sex marriage licenses, with one adding, \\"This case is not about these plaintiffs' desires to get married, the case is about [their] desire to force Kim Davis to approve and authorize their marriage in violation of her constitutionally protected religious beliefs.\\" Davis and her attorneys then sued Governor Beshear for ordering her to violate her religious beliefs instead of trying to accommodate them, arguing that Beshear, not Davis, should be held accountable for any legal damages from the ACLU lawsuit. On August 12, Bunning issued a temporary stay barring Davis from \\"applying her 'no marriage licenses' policy to future marriage license requests\\". Before the stay expired, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit refused to extend that ruling for an appeal. \\"It cannot be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County clerk's office ... may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution\\", the three-judge panel wrote unanimously in their refusal, continuing, \\"There is thus little or no likelihood that the clerk in her official capacity will prevail on appeal.\\" =Appeal= Liberty Counsel and Davis filed an emergency application to appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 31, 2015, in a one-line order, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, preventing Davis from legally continuing to deny marriage licenses. In response to the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to grant her stay request, Davis stated: Davis continued to defy Bunning's court order after the Supreme Court's refusal. The following morning, several couples sought to obtain marriage licenses, but Davis turned them away, saying she was acting \\"under God's authority\\". Some in the media questioned whether Davis, having been married four times and only recently converted, was acting hypocritically in the application of her beliefs. =Contempt of court and jailing= Bunning ordered Davis and her six deputy clerks to appear before him on after the six couples sought to have her held in contempt of court. Bunning ruled in the plaintiffs' favor and held Davis in contempt. The ACLU asked the court to fine Davis, but Bunning ordered her remanded in custody after the hearing. The judge said Davis would remain there until she complied with the court's order to issue marriage licenses. Bunning then spoke with each of the deputy clerks who reported to Davis. Only her son, Nathan Davis, told the judge he refused to comply with the court's order to start issuing marriage licenses; Bunning declined to hold him in contempt. After the hearing, U.S. Marshals transported Davis to the Carter County Detention Center in Grayson. On Friday, September 4, the first day her office was open during her incarceration, Davis's deputy clerks began issuing marriage licenses to all couples. James Yates and William Smith Jr. (independently suing Davis) were the first couple in Rowan County to receive a marriage license since Obergefell. They were soon followed by other couples who were plaintiffs against Davis. Through her Liberty Counsel attorneys, Davis filed an appeal of the order holding her in contempt of court, asking that she be released immediately from jail and that her name be removed from marriage licenses, allowing her deputies to issue them. Separately, Davis asked Governor Beshear to free her. The governor's office said that the conflict was a \\"matter between her and the courts\\"; Beshear added that he lacked the legal authority to either remove Davis from office or to relieve Davis of her statutory duties. Rowan County Democratic Judge- Executive Walter Blevins stated that he did not believe he would need to appoint a replacement for Davis, and that he believed the Attorney General of Kentucky and \\"the General Assembly will pass something where marriage licenses don't have anyone's name on them\\". =Release and return to work= Five days later, on Tuesday, September 8, Bunning ordered Davis released from jail. The order stated: \\"Defendant Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. If Defendant Davis should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this order and appropriate sanctions will be considered.\\" Bunning's order also stated that Davis's deputy clerks must continue to comply with his earlier order to issue marriage licenses and to submit status reports to him every fourteen days confirming their compliance. The deputy clerks released statements pledging to continue issuing licenses after Davis's release and to ignore any order from her to do otherwise, complying with the federal judge's order. Licenses issued since Davis's refusal state that they are authorized by \\"the office of the Rowan County Clerk\\" but no longer bear her name. Davis's supporters, gathered at the Rowan County Courthouse since her first day in custody, said that her deputies were unlawfully issuing licenses and should resign or be fired. Davis returned to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on the validity of the licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order. While Davis remained inside her personal office, same-sex couples successfully walked out of the Rowan County clerk's office with their marriage licenses. One of the applicants said, \\"My license is valid, and it's valid because of the court order that's in effect ... It doesn't have to have her signature.\\" =Reactions to controversy= Davis gained international attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses and the ensuing controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, \\"Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, but they are not at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant.\\" Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis \\"waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job\\". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis's refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile \\"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\\" protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, \\"Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes ... but as a public servant, she does not have the right to pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide.\\" Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that \\"Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her.\\" Opposition to the federal ruling came from political columnists William McGurn of The Wall Street Journal and Ray Nothstine of The Christian Post. Law professor Eugene Volokh suggested that the Kentucky's state religious freedom restoration act might compel the state to accommodate Davis's religious beliefs and argued that state courts have the authority to order the removal of Davis's name from marriage licenses. Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers also came to Davis's defense; he stated, in an amicus brief filed in federal court, that the \\"Supreme Court ruling has completely obliterated the definition of marriage\\". Liberty Counsel, the law firm defending Davis, stated, \\"Kim Davis is being treated as a criminal because she cannot violate her conscience\\", stating also that she refused to accept a proposed compromise where she would no longer be found in contempt if she agreed not to interfere with her deputies issuing licenses to same-sex couples. Reactions against Davis also came from the White House, from Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, and from candidates in the race for the 2016 presidential election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, \\"No public official is above the rule of law. Certainly not the president of the United States, but neither is the Rowan County clerk.\\" Governor Beshear said the judge's decision \\"speaks for itself\\", while his attorneys called the legal arguments in her suit against him \\"absurd\\". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, \\"Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law ‚Äì end of story.\\" Several Republican presidential candidates also called on Davis to comply with court orders. Donald Trump said, \\"the decision's been made, and that is the law of the land.\\" Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said Davis \\"is sworn to uphold the law\\", but also suggested that some sort of accommodation be made for her. Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both suggested that Davis should comply with the court order or resign. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested against Davis for her multiple divorces and marriages, saying she is living in adultery. Westboro also stated \\"God hates oath breakers\\", therefore Davis is obligated to follow the nation's law. Several national Republican politicians supported Davis. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, said that the Kim Davis affair was part of a \\"criminalization of Christianity\\" and organized a rally for Davis outside the jail where she had been held. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential candidate, said that Davis was a victim of \\"judicial tyranny\\" and attended the same rally. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, also presidential candidates, both voiced their support for Davis. Matt Bevin, the Republican nominee for Kentucky governor in the 2015 election, said a simple solution to Davis's plight is for the government to stop providing marriage contracts. A survey of American adults conducted by YouGov in September 2015 found that 56% supported Judge Bunning's decision to jail Davis for contempt of court, while 31% of Americans opposed the decision. When asked what Davis should do, 65% said that Davis should resign from office; 23% said that Davis should stay in office and continue to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and 4% said that Davis should remain in office but issue licenses to all persons legally entitled to one. =Opposition by other court clerks= Other court clerks in the U.S. have also refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The probate judges of several counties in Alabama have stopped issuing marriage licenses to anyone. Probate Judge Nick Williams of Washington County, Alabama, said he stopped issuing licenses altogether to avoid discrimination and said, \\"I completely disagree with the authority the Supreme Court has.\\" Probate Judge John Enslen of Elmore County, Alabama, said the federal government, not state probate offices, should be the entity issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Casey Davis (unrelated to Kim Davis), a clerk in Casey County, Kentucky, said, \\"We've not tried to prevent same-sex marriages, we've only tried to exercise our First Amendment rights\\", adding that such applicants could apply in other counties. Kay Schwartz, a clerk in Whitley County, Kentucky, felt oppressed: \\"There's a law against bullying ... Why take away the majority's right [just] to give the minority their rights?\\" She suggested the possibility of other options to meet the needs of same-sex applicants, such as an online service. The ACLU has no plans for legal action against other court clerks or probate judges. National attention has not been on them as the ACLU brought no case against them, speculated University of Kentucky political science professor D. B. Riggle: \\"The action in Rowan County may be in part due to the availability of plaintiffs for a case.\\" =Decisions and issues= Under Kentucky law, a commonwealth's attorney has the power to indict various local officials including \\"judges-executives, justices of the peace, sheriffs, coroners, surveyors, jailers, county attorneys and constables\\" for \\"malfeasance in office or willful neglect in the discharge of official duties\\" (an offense punishable by removal from office and a fine of up to $1,000); however, the statute doesn't include county clerks. USA Today writer Andrew Wolfson blamed \\"some reason lost to history\\" for the omission. Because Davis is an elected official, she cannot simply be fired. For Davis to be removed from the office of county clerk, impeachment proceedings must be initiated by the Kentucky House of Representatives and charges for impeachment brought to the Kentucky Senate. After being denied a license four times, one couple asked the Rowan County Attorney's Office to investigate Davis for official misconduct, a misdemeanor under Kentucky law. Official misconduct in the first degree is a Class A misdemeanor and is punishable with imprisonment not to exceed 12 months and fines of $500. The Rowan County Attorney's Office is prohibited from prosecuting Davis; Rowan County Attorney Cecil Watkins referred the official misconduct complaint to the Kentucky Attorney General's office, led by Attorney General Jack Conway. The Kentucky Attorney General's office conducted a review, and Conway issued a statement saying, \\"We are a nation of laws, and no one can defy an order from a federal judge.\\" Conway then issued a one-sentence statement saying that he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Davis. Months after Davis's office began issuing same-sex marriage licenses, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to overturn four of Bunning's decisions, calling them a \\"rush to judgment\\" that \\"imposed direct pressure and substantial burden on Davis, forcing her to choose between her religious beliefs and forfeiting her essential personal freedom on one hand, or abandoning those beliefs to keep her freedom on the other hand\\". The court denied the motion on November 5. Davis's lawyers filed their last appeal the next day, requesting a delay in issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples, arguing that previous decisions should apply only to the four couples to whom Davis's office was initially ordered to issue licenses. The appeal also asked the sixth circuit court of appeals to overturn a previous ruling that had sent Davis to jail for failure to comply. This final appeal was denied two days later by the court. In March 2016, the Campaign for Accountability (CfA), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, made a request to Davis for access to public records under the Kentucky Open Records Act, seeking copies of retainer agreements and lawyer-client engagement agreements between Davis and her attorneys at Liberty Counsel. Liberty Counsel, which responded to the request on Davis's behalf, refused to comply, arguing that the documents were preliminary and private records are not subject to the Act. CfA appealed to the Office of the Kentucky Attorney General, which under Kentucky law has the authority to make binding rulings on the Open Records Act, and resubmitted its request to Davis's office in April 2016. The Attorney General's Office sought to privately review the records at issue to determine if an exemption applied, but Liberty Counsel refused to make most of the documents available for a private review. In an opinion issued on June 30, 2016, the Attorney General's Office determined that Davis had violated the Open Records Act, saying that her conduct had the effect of \\"intentionally frustrating the attorney general's review of an open records request\\" which \\"would subvert the General Assembly's intent behind providing review by the attorney general.\\" One of the first acts of newly elected Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin was an executive order to remove clerks' names from the state marriage licenses. Bevin expressed his hope on November 6, 2015, that the executive order will protect the religious beliefs of officials who are opposed to gay marriage. Kim Davis and her attorneys at Liberty Counsel immediately requested that the court dismiss her appeals, because the new regulation provides a religious accommodation for her and makes the case moot. Bunning agreed, dismissing the three lawsuits filed against her, saying the new governor's order to use a license form that does not require the county clerk's signature has removed the controversy before the court. One of the plaintiff couples who were denied marriage licenses from Davis contacted Bunning, requesting they be allowed to recoup $230,000 in legal fees. Davis's attorneys asserted that their legislative victory resolves the matter; the couples did not prevail against Davis, therefore they are not entitled to demand that Davis reimburse their legal fees. Separately, Rowan County filed a response contending that the county government should never have to pay for the actions of a single county clerk. Then, by May 2017, a Cincinnati federal appeals court found that Bunning had erred in finding that damages claims by plaintiff couple David Ermold and David Moore became moot, saying, \\"The district court's characterization of this case as simply contesting the 'no marriage licenses' policy is inaccurate, because Ermold and Moore did not seek an injunction‚Äîthey sought only damages\\"; observing that the record does not prevent damages claims. The three-judge panel granted leave for the couple to sue for damages over one marriage license. Their case was sent back to Bunning, where he stated that the state of Kentucky was obligated to pay $222,000 in legal fees. The ACLU itself sued Davis to recover $233,000 in legal fees, but the motion was denied; the organization was not a \\"prevailing party\\" in the legal action. In July 2017, Davis was again sued for failing to issue a marriage license. The plaintiff, , Vanderbilt University Law School graduate, was denied a license to marry a laptop computer. A similar Florida lawsuit was dismissed in May. By February 2019, Governor Bevin formally rejected the idea of Kentucky bearing the $222,000 financial responsibility, insisting the amount should be paid by Kim Davis alone. \\"Only Davis refused to comply with the law\\" Bevin stated through his attorneys, insisting taxpayers \\"should not have to collectively bear the financial responsibility for Davis's intransigence.\\" U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning issued a preliminary injunction ordering Davis's office to resume issuing marriage licenses.https://www.aclu.org/cases/miller-v-davishttps://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/2017/07/21/judge-rowan-county-must- pay-226-695-attorneys-fees-same-sex-couples-who-sued-clerk-kim- davis/499280001/ Bunning also ordered the state of Kentucky to pay her legal fees, writing that \\"Davis represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky when she refused to issue marriage licenses to legally eligible couples.

Meeting with Pope Francis Pope Francis visited the U.S. in September 2015. Within a few weeks of Davis's release from jail, Davis announced she and her husband had met with Pope Francis on September 24, 2015, at the Apostolic Nunciature to the United States in Washington, D.C., during the Pope's U.S. visit in September 2015. According to Davis and her lawyer, the pope told Davis to \\"stay strong\\" and gave her two rosaries. Vaticanist John L. Allen Jr. said that \\"there's no way to view the encounter other than as a broad gesture of support by the pope for conscientious objection from gay marriage laws\\" and that the gesture strengthened the hand of those who defend religious freedom. Two days later, the Holy See Press Office issued a statement saying that \\"the Pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects\\". According to Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica, the Pope met with several dozen other people, and rosaries were also given to others in attendance; Davis was not invited by the Pope to the Nunciature, and \\"the meeting may have been manipulated by her and her lawyer\\". The only audience given by the Pope while in Washington was with a former student of his, an openly gay Argentine named Yayo Grassi, and Grassi's same- sex partner of 19 years. Observers speculated whether the Pope had not been informed of Davis's controversy or if the Vatican had underestimated the media impact that such a meeting would cause. Reelection campaign Davis announced that she would run for reelection in 2018 as a Republican. Davis did not face any challengers in the Republican primary. Four Democrats ran in the May 2018 primary with the winner being Rowan County Assistant Property Valuation Administrator Elwood Caudill Jr., whom Davis narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary in 2014. One of the Democrats Caudill defeated was David Ermold, who had been denied a marriage license by Davis and then filed suit against her. Davis lost her reelection campaign on November 6, 2018 when she was defeated by Caudill in the general election by a little over 8 percentage points. Personal life Davis has been married four times to three husbands. The first three marriages ended in divorce in 1994, 2006, and 2008. Davis has two daughters from her first marriage and twins, a son and another daughter, who were born five months after her divorce from her first husband. Her third husband is the biological father of the twins, the children being conceived while Davis was still married to her first husband. The twins were adopted by Davis' current husband, Joe Davis, who was also her second husband; the couple initially divorced in 2006 but later remarried. Joe Davis has also stated his support for her stance against same-sex marriage. Davis's son Nathan works in her office as a deputy clerk and has taken the same position of denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Shortly after the same-sex marriage license controversy, Davis said she and her husband switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. Davis says she experienced a religious awakening in 2011, following her mother-in-law's dying wish that she attend church. Since then Davis has identified herself as a Christian, belonging to the Apostolic Pentecostal movement, which favors what they describe as a literal interpretation of the Bible. She worships three times a week at the Solid Rock Apostolic Church near Morehead. Following her conversion, Davis let her hair grow long, stopped wearing makeup and jewelry, and began wearing skirts and dresses that fall below the knee, in keeping with Apostolic Pentecostal tenets regarding outward holiness and modest dress. She also held a weekly Bible study for female inmates at the local jail. In an interview in January 2016, Davis said that she believed that \\"we are living in end times.\\" Davis also expressed her view that the Bible is infallible. In popular culture Davis was the subject of numerous satirical works following her burst of media attention in 2015. Books, social media profiles, and videos have been created that parody Davis's refusal to issue marriage licenses in Kentucky. A Twitter account with more than 90,000 followers and run by comedian Dave Colan mocks Davis with humorous tweets supposedly from a woman who \\"Sits Next to Kim Davis\\". Funny or Die made a Mashup video featuring characters from Parks and Recreation that spoofs Davis's refusal to issue marriage licenses and parodies her meeting with Pope Francis. Author Lilith St. Augustine wrote Kim Goes To Jail: An Erotic Story, an erotic novella featuring Davis in a fictional role. La Strega Entertainment created a satirical music video sung to the tune of the \\"Major-General's Song\\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. Saturday Night Live cast member Aidy Bryant portrayed Davis during the show's season 41 premiere. Actress Jennifer Lawrence, in the December 2015 issue of Vogue, told Jonathan Van Meter that Kim Davis is a \\"lady that makes me embarrassed to be from Kentucky.\\" Electoral history ;2014 Democratic primary ;2014 general election ;2018 Republican primary ;2018 general election See also * List of American politicians who switched parties in office *Masterpiece Cakeshop v.

He was a distant relation of his namesake the writer Henry Wharton. Life Wharton was the son of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton. He was first commissioned into the English Army in 1674 during the reign of Charles II. During the reign of James II, while still a Captain, he was an active participant in the conspiracy against the King which also included his father and brother Thomas Wharton.Childs. The Army, James II and the Glorious Revolution p.149-50 During the Glorious Revolution in 1688 he was one of a number of army officers who defected to William III's invading Dutch Army at Exeter.Childs. The Army, James II and the Glorious Revolution p.185 After the Revolution he was promoted to command the old regiment of Lord Lichfield. Wharton's regiment was reformed and sent to Ireland, where Jacobite supporters of King James still held power. In August 1689 Wharton and his regiment landed in County Down as part of Marshal Schomberg's expedition and were tasked with securing Belfast whose Jacobite garrison had abandoned the town. Wharton's men subsequently participated in the successful Siege of Carrickfergus. During the final negotiations for surrender, Wharton's troops remained poised to assault the town as an inducement for the Jacobites to agree terms.Childs. The Williamite War p.153 On 28 October 1689 he died of illness at Dundalk Camp, during the stand-off between the rival armies of Schomberg and James II. He was one of thousands of Williamite casualties, who suffered from exposure in the climate during their time at Dundalk. After Wharton's death, his regiment came under the command of Richard Brewer and served in Flanders during the Nine Years' War. He developed a reputation as both a notorious duellist and womaniser.Wilson p.293 In 1686 he killed Lieutenant Robert Moxon, an Irish Catholic officer in his own regiment in a duel.Childs.
