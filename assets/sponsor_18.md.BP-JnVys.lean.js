Although a full survey was conducted in 1892 and a Private Bill was submitted to the Westminster Parliament on 18 November 1892 Edinburgh Gazette, 18 November 1892, pp.1262ff, the necessary Act to permit construction did not receive approval and the plan was dropped. Historical background In 1890 and 1891, six lines connecting the west of north Scotland to the central spine were to be considered by two Parliamentary Commissions. Report of the Western Highlands and Islands Commission, August 1890Report of the North-West Coast of Scotland Railway Committee, April 1892 These were: * the extension of the Dingwall and Skye Railway from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh * the extension of the West Highland line from Banavie to Mallaig and new branch-lines from: * Garve to Ullapool, leading from the Dingwall and Skye Railway * Achnasheen to Aultbea, also leading from the Dingwall and Skye Railway * Lairg to Laxford, leading from the Far North Line * Culrain to Lochinver, also leading from the Far North Line All six lines were designed to open up transport facilities for fish-catches, passengers and mail on the west coast, and - for the last four named above - specifically for steamer services to Stornoway. The two extensions to Mallaig and Kyle of Lochalsh were completed, however none of the four additional proposals were ever built. Proposal and route A scheme for a railway to run between Achnasheen and Aultbea was first proposed in early 1889 by landowners in the Gairloch and Loch Ewe area.The Scotsman, 6 June 1889, p.7 The main proposers were: Sir Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch; the 2nd Earl of Lovelace; Duncan Darroch of Gourock and Torridon; Paul Liot Bankes of Letterewe; and John Dixon of Inveran. Dixon was the principal driver in the campaign to attract support and funding. Between 1890 and 1892, he composed dozens of letters, memoranda and pamphlets, and sent them to the Scottish Office, MPs and Cabinet Ministers in London; and he organised or encouraged public meetings in the Gairloch area and on the Isle of Lewis.See correspondence from John Dixon et al to Scottish Office, 1889-1892: National Records of Scotland - refs AF67/202-210 and AF67/236 As well as stressing the advantages for fisheries and passenger-traffic, the campaign flagged up the potential for increased tourist-traffic to the area. Many of the arguments put forward were deliberately phrased to show that the Aultbea proposal was far better than the rival Garve to Ullapool railway which, in August 1890, had already received Parliamentary approval. Victoria Falls, named following a visit by Queen Victoria. The route was surveyed by the firm of Thomas Meik & Sons in the autumn of 1892. Their plans Thomas Meik and Sons ‚Äì Loch Maree and Aultbea Railway Railway ‚Äì Bound Plans, Sections and Book of Reference: National Records of Scotland - ref RHP82306 showed the line branching off the Dingwall to Skye line about south-west of Achnasheen station, at a height of around above sea-level. It circled round the back of Ledgowan Lodge, passed south of Loch a‚ÄôChroisg, and remained well south of the road to take advantage of the hillside contours, before looping in a reverse S-shape north, east and then west to enter Glen Docherty. There was an ascent up the hill to the highest point on the line (); a descent of the glen on its southern slope at a gradient of 1:33 for ; down to the western end of the glen; then it circled south of the village of Kinlochewe on a tall viaduct; and then rejoined the road (now the A832). Then it hugged the south shore of Loch Maree as far as Slattadale, passing the famous Victoria Falls en route. Where the road then veered due west towards Gairloch, the railway instead headed north along the shore, straight for Poolewe. Two tunnels would have to be built near the north-west end of Loch Maree. After bending around the south side of Poolewe, the line headed northwards along the east shore of Loch Ewe, passing round the back of Osgood Mackenzie's Inverewe estate and terminating at the shore-end of the pier at Aultbea. A new pier was to be constructed, in length. The total measured distance of the line from Achnasheen to Aultbea was just over - to be precise: 37 miles 2 furlongs 9 chains and 20 yards. The total cost was estimated to be in the region of ¬£200,000. Abandonment Despite all the efforts of Dixon and his fellow-proposers, the proposal was completely rejected by the 'North-West Coast of Scotland Railways Committee' which was tasked in 1891 with recommending which of the six railways (above) should receive Governmental approval. This rejection did not prevent the backers from arranging their Private Bill. Letter from Durnford & Co to W.C.Dunbar, 16 December 1892: National Records of Scotland - ref: AF67/209 But, despite the Bill receiving a second reading in the House of Commons in April 1893 The Scotsman, 22 April 1893, p.9, no further support was forthcoming, no Act was passed, and the scheme had to be dropped.

It teaches both general and technical education. It celebrated its centenary in 1980.  History  Lesser gallery Interior courtyard Built in 1880, the lyc√©e Arago started as a higher primary school (EPS). Schools of this type were created by Fran√ßois Guizot under the law of 1833 to widen secondary education to those children from poorer families. The EPS in Paris particularly were real colleges. All the disciplines usually associated with the royal colleges were offered, apart from Greek and Latin, which were replaced by foreign languages. Students at the √©cole Arago even received calligraphy classes. The Parisian EPS were a great success. They prepared students for schools such as the √âcole de physique et chimie de Paris, the √âcole nationale des Arts et M√©tiers, and the √âcole normale d'instituteurs. The estimated cost for the √©cole Arago was gold francs (1877) just for construction. This cost did not include the cost of the land (belonging to the City of Paris), school furniture, physics equipment, chemistry, collections, models, gym equipment, utilities, and other necessary equipment. At this time, it was considered that this work was undeniably useful. Studies lasted from 32 ¬Ω hours in the first year to 48h in the fourth year. The √âcole Arago contributed to the democratisation of education, allowing students to work in industry and commerce, but also in arts and letters, considered as more noble. In 1945, EPS Arago became a municipal college: at this time municipal colleges were the equivalent of lyc√©e with all classes between 6th year and final year, plus coll√®ge Arago offered preparatory classes for the ENSAM. In 1960, due to the reforms of the 5th Republic, the municipal college of Arago became a lyc√©e, managed by the State.

He is a researcher for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and is well known for the work he has done on Barro Colorado Island. He is a US citizen, but has resided at the Smithsonian in Panama for nearly 50 years. Along with studies on Barro Colorado Island, Leigh is also known for the research he has done related to the Isthmus of Panama and its historical significance on the evolution of South American species.  Early life and education  When he was a young man, Leigh's initial interests had him drawn to topics of history. A biology teacher he had in the 10th grade changed that by shifting his interests to that of biology.S. Tejada (personal communication, November 20, 2018) From then on, he pursued an education in biology, but still incorporated his initial interest of history into his studies. Leigh received his B.A. degree in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1962 and his Ph. D. in Biology from Yale University in 1966 while studying under G. Evelyn Hutchinson.  Career  Leigh's career began as a teacher. He briefly held an ‚ÄúActing Instructor‚Äù position in biology at Stanford University during the spring of 1966, but then took on an Assistant Professor of biology position at Princeton University which lasted from 1966-1972. While in this position, Leigh was appointed by Princeton to act as a biologist for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute starting in 1969, one of the first to ever join STRI's scientific staff. His partnership with Princeton and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) lasted from 1969-1972. After 1972, Leigh left his teaching position at Princeton and solely dedicated his time to his research with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. While working with STRI, Leigh was sent around the world to compare altitudinal gradients in tropical forests that included the Ivory Coast of Madagascar and montane forests in India. During this time, Leigh was also based in Barro Colorado Island by STRI from 1969 to 2011 to conduct research on the island.  Research contributions  Leigh's primary research interests involve evolutionary biology and, more specifically, how cooperation (within and between species) has evolved and the ways in which mutualism ‚Äúenhances ecosystem productivity and its diversity‚Äù. He also looks to answer the question of why there are such an abundance and diversity of trees in tropical ecosystems and has been involved in research regarding evolutionary biogeography of islands, such as Madagascar and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's Barro Colorado Island. = The evolution of island biogeography = Research by Leigh and his colleagues investigated why it is larger islands have more species who descended from species from the main land compared to smaller islands, even though it has been millions of years since either sized island has been connected to a mainland. Much of Leigh's work was done on the island of Madagascar, considered a large island. When comparing the historical data found on Madagascar and other large islands to the smaller islands, they found that smaller islands tend to have less descendants because the smaller size of the island makes it less attractive for species to colonize. The smaller space increases extinction and decreases opportunities for diversification. This work, along with countless other studies performed by Leigh and his colleagues contributed to the framework of island biogeography and provided supporting evidence to its influence on the evolution of tropical ecosystems.Egbert Giles Leigh, Annette Hladik, Claude Marcel Hladik, Alison Jolly. The biogeography of large islands, or how does the size of the ecological theater affect the evolutionary play. Revue d‚Äô√©cologie, 2007, 62, pp.105-168. = Barro Colorado Island, a ‚ÄúNature Monument‚Äù = alt= In the world of science, Barro Colorado Island is considered one of the most famous tropical forests in the world due to the intensity in which its ecosystem has been studied. Research on the island has been under the supervision of the Smithsonian since the mid-1960s, which is when the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute was formed. Leigh has been part of long-term forest and climate monitoring studies, which were implemented by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute during its formation and continue to present day. However, his work on the island has consisted of mainly synthesizing other people's data vs doing his own field work. In this way, he has acted as an advisor for other scientists' projects and helped to connect all of the research into a bigger picture that depicts how tropical ecosystems change over time. = Historical biogeography = Isthmus of Panama Much of Leigh's research focuses on explaining how present- day species came to be by examining how their ancestors evolved under the influential changes of geography the earth has experienced over its lifetime. The Isthmus of Panama is one of those geographical structures that has changed over millions of years. Three million years go it formed, connecting North and South America, and caused an exchange of species between the two continents known as the Great American Biotic Interchange. This greatly affected the biota of South America, a continent that had originally been isolated for over 50 million years, by connecting it to the rest of the world. At the time the isthmus formed, North America was also connected to the rest of Eurasia by another land bridge. Leigh's work has examined how the flora and fauna changed in Panama since the formation of the isthmus and how it influenced the tropical ecosystems of South America known today.

Early life and education  V√°zquez was born in Santurce, San Juan and raised in Guaynabo. Her parents worked in a factory, her father as a security guard, her mother died at the age of 53. Her father has been remarried for twenty years. She has a younger brother and an older sister. She began her primary studies at the Ram√≥n Mar√≠n and Margarita Janer schools in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.https://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/conoce/gobernadora V√°zquez became interested in law at an early age. She said in an interview that she used to watch TV shows like Hawaii Five-O with her father, which led her to realize she wanted to follow a career along that line. V√°zquez studied at the University of Puerto Rico, where she completed her bachelor's degree. After that, she completed her Juris doctor (J.D.) at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law.Insisten en renuncia de Wanda V√°zquez: L√≠der cameral dice que este paso ayudar√≠a a la jefa de Justicia a demostrar su integridad. Ayeza D√≠az Rol√≥n. EL VOCERO November 30, 2018. Accessed March 3, 2020.  Career  During the 1980s, V√°zquez worked for the Puerto Rico Department of Housing. She then worked as a district attorney for the Puerto Rico Department of Justice for 20 years. V√°zquez specialized in cases of domestic and gender violence. She also worked in the Criminal Division for the Bayam√≥n Prosecutor's office. In 2010, V√°zquez was appointed to replace Ivonne Feliciano as the head of the Office for Women's Rights of the island. On November 30, 2016, Governor-elect Ricardo Rossell√≥ nominated her for the position of Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico. She was confirmed and sworn in January 18, 2017. = Governor of Puerto Rico = Wanda V√°zquez Garced meeting with Representative Don Young (R-AK) in November 2019. Wanda V√°zquez during her meeting with Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT). V√°zquez was initially expected to become governor of Puerto Rico after the resignation of Ricardo Rossell√≥ on August 2, 2019. She was met with opposition, with critics calling for her resignation due to allegations of corruption and inability to deal with domestic violence on the island. Protests against her proposed succession as governor took place, the most notable of these being the Somos M√°s march, Spanish for \\"We Are More\\", a title alluding to a popular chant during the protests calling for Rossell√≥'s resignation. The hashtag #WandaRenuncia (Spanish for \\"Wanda Resign\\") began trending on Twitter soon after Rossell√≥ announced his intention to resign. V√°zquez said on Twitter that she had no interest in becoming governor, and that she would take the position only if she were constitutionally required to. On July 31, Rossell√≥ announced that he was appointing Pedro Pierluisi as the new Secretary of State; the secretary of state supersedes the secretary of justice in the order of succession. On August 1, however, the Puerto Rican Senate blocked Pierluisi from being confirmed as secretary of state in time for Rossell√≥'s resignation on August 2. Upon Rossell√≥'s resignation, Pierluisi succeeded to the governorship in a de facto manner instead of V√°zquez. However, he was not confirmed by the Senate, calling into question the validity of his governorship. On August 7, 2019, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled that Pierluisi was sworn in on unconstitutional grounds and removed him from office, effective at 5 p.m. AST. At that time, V√°zquez became the second female governor of Puerto Rico. V√°zquez stated she wants to recover Hurricane Maria relief funds, and review all government contracts to ensure they are managed correctly, free of corruption. She said she wants to work with President Donald Trump to help the island of Puerto Rico and its 3.2 million American citizens. She stated all contracts signed by Ricardo Rossell√≥ would be reviewed. At the same time, HUD (Housing and Urban Development) stated that hurricane funds would be delayed to Puerto Rico due to corruption, and incapacity to absorb funds for projects, respectively. In the aftermath of 2019‚Äì20 Puerto Rico earthquakes residents discovered unused aid from Hurricane Maria in a warehouse in Ponce and as a result V√°zquez fired her emergency management director. On July 21, 2020, the Puerto Rico Office of the Special Independent Prosecutor's Panel opened a case against V√°zquez for alleged violation of the Commonwealth's ethics law, as well as federal regulations, related to her handling of aid to the earthquake victims. She responded by accusing the judge in charge of the investigation of being a supporter of her primary elections challenger Pedro Pierluisi. V√°zquez was ordered by the panel to present evidence in the form of photos which she claimed demonstrated that political motives were behind the investigation, but she failed to provide said evidence. On March 12, 2020, V√°zquez declared a state of emergency for Puerto Rico and activated the Puerto Rican National Guard as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. On October 6, 2020, V√°squez endorsed Donald Trump for the 2020 United States presidential election.  2020 primaries  On August 16, 2020, V√°zquez lost the gubernatorial primary race to Pedro Pierluisi. With 75.6% of voting stations reporting, Pierluisi had won about 57.9% of the votes to Vazquez‚Äôs 42.1%, clinching the nomination for New Progressive Party. Pierluisi claimed victory after V√°zquez recognized his lead and said she respected the will of voters.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/puerto-rico-governor-vazquez- loses-primary-race-to-pierluisi/ar- BB181Adl?li=BBnbcA1https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-gov-wanda- vazquez-loses-primary-pro-statehood-party-n1236901  Personal life  V√°zquez is married to Jorge D√≠az Rever√≥n, a judge in Caguas, Puerto Rico.

She is a pioneer in ecological and evolutionary symbiotic relationships between sea animals and their microbial partners inhabiting environments that harbour low nutrient concentrations. She was responsible for the discovery of a new form of symbiosis between two kinds of bacteria and the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis.  Early life  Her father was an american businessman and her mother was a german immigrant descendant of the physician and electrophysiology pioneer Emil du Bois-Reymond and Fanny Mendelssohn a renowned pianist and composer. At a young age, Nicole Dubilier's first aspirations ventured into the artistic realm of classical ballet. In 1970 Stuttgart Ballet accepted her to train with John Cranko (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany). However, she decided to stay in Wiesbaden (Hessen, Germany) with her mother and three siblings. During her primary education, basic science did not feature on her repertoire of interests, yet her visits to the Fire Island (Long Island, New York) and an internship at the marine station on Helgoland (Germany) carved her prospective in Marine Biology.  Career  In 1985, Dubilier obtained her degree in Zoology, Biochemistry and Microbiology and completed her Ph.D. in Marine Biology at the University Hamburg with Olav Giere in 1992. During her graduate studies, she found herself dispassionate about her research, often wanting to quit, but her persistence propelled her to the finishline. In 1992, motivated to re-discover the excitement of her field, Dubilier attended a molecular biology summer course taught by Donald Manahan at University of Southern California. Later, from 1993-1995, she experienced her first Post-doc with the guidance of Colleen Cavanaugh on hydrothermal vents chemosynthetic life forms. Two years later, she started her career at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology (MPI-MM), first as a Postdoc studying the Evolution of bacterial symbiosis in gutless worms (1997-2001) and afterwards as the Coordinator of the MPI-MM International Research Program (2002-2017), Head of the Symbiosis Laboratory (2001-2017) and the Head of the Symbiosis Department (since 2013).. Dubilier has continued her work on symbiotic relationships within chemosynthetic living organisms, expanding her exploration of both shallow and deep-sea environments, ranging from seagrass to coastal sediments, through meta-omic approaches, e.g. metaproteomics and metagenomics.

The rivalry between the Kodokan school of judo and the Totsuka school of Yoshin-ryu jujutsu happened at the 1880s during the Meiji Restoration in Japan. Composed by several challenges and tournaments, and its result saw the decline of the traditional jujutsu schools and the rise of judo as an institutionalized martial art. Although surrounded in controversy and legend due to inconsistent sources, it has been considered a vital part of the history of judo. Background Kano at the age of 28. The Yoshin-ry≈´ school, most specifically the branch founded by Hikosuke Totsuka, had been considered Japan's biggest and most influential koryu jujutsu school since the end of the Bakumatsu period in 1868. Though based on Chiba, it had its main field of operations in Tokyo and was reputed to have three thousands trainees in said city only. In contrast, the Kodokan school wasn't created until 1882, when a practitioner of the Kit≈ç-ry≈´ and Tenshin Shiny≈ç-ry≈´ styles named Jigoro Kano established the foundations of his own martial discipline, judo, with a handful of apprentices. The fast rise in popularity and success of the Kodokan was a source of conflict with the rest of national jujutsu schools, among them the Totsuka Yoshin-ry≈´, which saw Kano's style as a threat to its hegemony and a sign of disrespect to older traditions. The first recorded contact between Kano and the Totsuka Yoshin-ry≈´ happened before the existence of Kodokan, back when Kano was still a student in Tokyo University and a mere jujutsu apprentice. During an exhibition of the Yoshin-ry≈´ style, hosted by the university authorities in 1880 and directed by Hikosuke's son Hidemi Totsuka, the young Kano left the spectator seats and joined the jujutsukas during their randori in order to test his own skills. However, Kano was dominated, being dragged around by his opponent without managing to score a technique. His performance was good enough to avoid a defeat and earn a draw, which attracted the praise of Totsuka himself, but the experience only served as a motivation to hone his abilities. The act was witnessed by Dr. Erwin Balz, an associate to the Totsuka school, who described other Tokyo students trying their luck along with Kano, with similar results. Kano continued his jujutsu apprenticeship and established his school, Kodokan (popularly called \\"Kano-ry≈´\\" or \\"Kodokan-ry≈´\\" by other factions), in 1882. Soon after, he and his followers found themselves subject to the practice of , where fighters from other jujutsu schools would come to the building to challenge them to fight. Duels between members of different schools were called and used to be brutal competitions with few rules hosted for their schools's reputation. The jujutsukas's opposition to the Kodokan was fueled not only by martial rivalry, but also by Kano's incorporation of modern and foreign ideas and his role as an educator and intellectual man. About this period, Kano would write, \\"It seemed that the K≈çd≈çkan had to take on the whole of Japan.\\" However, the Totsuka school and its associated would be its main adversary. First challenges An older Tsunejiro Tomita. According to chronicles by Tsunejiro Tomita and his son Tsuneo, the first taryujiai against a Totsuka member was in 1885. Daihachi Ichikawa, a master of Tenshin Shiny≈ç- ry≈´ affiliated to Totsuka, had opened his own dojo in Tokyo, and Kano and six followers paid a visit. The judokas practiced randori with the resident jujutsukas and other guests, but among all of them it was Shiro Saigo, the Kodokan's top apprentice, who stood out, throwing down all his sparring partners with ease. In response, Ichikawa himself visited the Kodokan shortly after, accompanied by Matsugoro Okuda and Morikichi Otake from Totsuka Yoshin- ry≈´. They demanded to host a challenge, but Kano was out that day, so Saigo and Tomita decided to accept in his absence. Saigo fought Okuda who, despite being taller and heavier, was thrown down repeatedly by koshi nage and deashi barai before being finished by yama arashi. Okuda suffered a concussion and had to be carried away. Despite the victory, Kano was not pleased with the match when he found out, as he thought his apprentices had shown themselves too eager to fight. In 1886, another Tenshin Shiny≈ç-ry≈´ dojo was opened in Tokyo, this time by master Magoroku Hachitani. Kano could not assist, but he sent Tomita, Takisaburo Tobari and several other Kodokan trainees to pay the obliged visit. However, when Tomita was performing randori with Mamoru, Magoroku's 14 years old son, he was approached by Hansuke Nakamura from Ryoi Shinto-ry≈´. A police hand-to-hand instructor with ties to the Totsuka school, Nakamura wanted revenge for his partners and challenged Tomita to a match. The latter described himself as too scared to accept, as Nakamura was much heavier and more experienced, but he eventually conceded. As soon as the match started, Tomita immediately scored a tomoe nage, and he repeated the technique two more times before his shocked opponent managed to block it. The judoka followed with an ouchi gari, which Nakamura blocked, and a hiza guruma, which seemed successful, but the jujutsuka pulled Tomita to the ground and tried to pin him with kami-shiho-gatame. In the process, however, Tomita locked a gyaku-juji-jime from the bottom. Trapped in the chokehold, Nakamura showed signs of hypoxia, so Hachitani stopped the match before he lost consciousness. Word of the Kodokan's victory spread quickly. Aside from Tomita's own version of the facts, Nakamura's apprentice Kazuo Ishibashi spoke about the fight in his memories, stating the loss drove Nakamura to stop drinking alcohol and start training intensely to get retribution from the Kodokan. A measure of revenge for the Totsuka school would be obtained by its member Taro Terushima, who reportedly dominated judoka Sumitomo Arima at the Ichikawa dojo later in the year. Police tournaments Viscount Michitsune Mishima, chief of the Metropolitan Police. The main clash between the Kodokan and the Totsuka schools would happen by mediation of Michitsune Mishima, prefect of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department from 1885 to 1888. Known for his political approach to \\"abolish the old and bring the new\\", Mishima was interested in renovating the hand-to-hand methods and teachers of the police, until then monopolized by the Totsuka Yoshin-ry≈´ and other minor koryu jujutsu factions. Upon hearing of the Kodokan's increasing fame, Mishima wanted them to test the effectivity of their art against the traditional jujutsu. In order to accomplish it, the Kodokan was asked to send judokas to one or more . It is acknowledged that the victory at these tournaments was the factor that turned judo from an obscure school to Japan's peak martial art. Categorization of those events meets an obstacle in the absence of direct registers and the relative disparity of existent sources. The Kodokan keeps no clear register on the matter, and this has been noted to have given birth to folklore and legends.Yoshiaki Todo, Judo no Rekishi no Bunka, 2007 It has been even said that the memories of those challenges are purely fictitious propaganda, although, as judo historian Sanzo Maruyama notes, it is difficult to understand judo's expansion without its victories over jujutsu. Counting on their veracity, it has been suggested there were more than a single tournament, which would have caused the confusion of dates and matches among the sources, as well that their police affiliation would have rendered the events private and away from public sources. The rules of the events are unknown. Sakujiro Yokoyama wrote that challenge matches of the time were harsh and brutal, often ending in death of participants, but the ruleset employed by the Metropolitan Police Department was described as comparatively more \\"civilized\\", presumably wanting to test what fighting system was the best for their non-lethal arresting techniques. It is apparent that matches could be won by either submission or referee stoppage, otherwise ending in a hikiwake or time limit draw. Judging for the attestations, it also seems both throws and submissions (or at least chokeholds) were allowed, while tactics like stalling or remaining disengaged on the ground were not penalized either. Some voices have claimed those rules gave the advantage to the judo side, but late commentators like Hajime Isogai have noted that the open format would have favored precisely the jujutsu side, who would have used the ground to avoid the judokas's superior wrestling. Finally, Maruyama described judokas as wearing their signature judogi, though in the short-sleeved, short-legged version used at the time, while the jujutsukas would wear a combination of haori and hakama, only shortened over the knees in order to allow for free movement. =First possible challenge= According to Kano's memories, an earlier police tournament that cannot be identified with the more famous Kodokan victory took place in 1886. The Kodokan was asked to send representatives to an event of both kenjutsu and jujutsu hosted by the Metropolitan Police. Although neither Saigo nor Tomita could attend the event, Kano could send Yoshitsugu Yamashita, Sakujiro Yokoyama, Takisaburo Tobari and Noritaka Sato, among others. Kano notes the competition was quite tough, as although the judokas were able to execute their tachi-waza or throwing techniques, several of them were in difficulty against the ne-waza or groundfighting expertise of the Totsuka Yoshin-ry≈´. This occurrence makes the account end in a low note, and is mentioned to have been a reason for the Kodokan to reinforce their own ne-waza training. =Yayoi shrine challenge= The most mentioned of the judo and jujutsu challenges is the , which would have had place in the Yayoi Shrine at Shiba Park in front of Mishima himself. Kano' and Tsuneo Tomita's accounts give the date as 1888, just before Mishima's death, a date indirectly supported by Yokoyama and considered more probable by Maruyama. Meanwhile, Yamashita and Itsuro Munakata (as interviewed by Maruyama) remember the year as 1886, the same as the rest of challenges. Shiro Saigo. The main participants at the side of the Kodokan would have been Saigo, Yamashita, Tomita, Yokoyama, later known as the \\"Kodokan Shitenno\\" or \\"The Four Guardians of Kodokan\\". Along with them, it would have been Hoken Sato (later known as Hoken Iwasaki), Itsuro Munakata, Takejiro Yuasa, Bunzo Matsuda, Matsujiro Honda, Katsutaro Oda, Keijiro Kawai, Katsukazu Otsubo, Shizuya Iwanami, and other members. The Totsuka school would have been represented by Totsuka's own \\"Shitenno\\" or \\"Four Guardians\\", Taro Terushima, Entaro Kochi, Teisuke Nishimura and Shintaro Katayama, along with other fighters. The referees were Tetsutaro Hisatomi and Yuhachiro Suzuki from Sekiguchi-ry≈´. According to most sources, the atmosphere of the event was heated. The Kodokan team was received with insults by the opposite team, most notably , which referenced not only the Kodokan's relatively short age compared to the traditional jujutsu schools, but also to the college background of many of the judokas compared to the martial uprbrining of most jujutsukas. Munakata stated that the judokas performed respectfully a full kneeling bow or , meant to address a superior, while the jujutsukas adhered to the one-handed, one-kneed bow of the old styles, meant to address in equal terms. * The first match would have been Yoshiaki Yamashita from Kodokan against Taro Terushima from Totsuka Yoshin. They were said to be the same size, with Terushima being slightly older. Terushima started attempting an ouchi gari, but Yamashita blocked it and answered scoring easily a hiza guruma. Terushima opted to remain on the ground, where he judged himself to be more skilled. Yamashita engaged him nonetheless, and they grappled until the referee called to end the match as a draw. * The second match, as described by Yamashita, saw Shizuya Iwanami from Kodokan against Shintaro Katayama from Totsuka. Feeling Katayama was uncharacteristically proficient at throwing for a Yoshin-ry≈´ jujutsuka, Iwanami clinched him tightly after gripping. From there, the judoka surreptitiously locked a standing juji-jime, and although Katayama tried to break it, the jujutsuka was choked out and fell unconscious. Kano has this match fought by Kawai instead of Iwanami. Yoshitsugu Yamashita. * The third match was between Shiro Saigo from Kodokan and Entaro Kochi from Totsuka. Kochi was apparently much heavier than Saigo, to the point they were described to look like a child and an adult, but Saigo's renowned skill rendered the fight a back-and-forth affair. Kochi dragged Saigo around and tried to throw him by harai goshi and uchi mata, but the judoka defended by slipping out of throws and landing on his knees and arms when thrown. Saigo then tried to come back with tomoe nage, only to Kochi to block it with his greater strength. After many minutes passed, however, Kochi started showing signs of fatigue, and Saigo succeeded at using his momentum against him to throw him with yama arashi. Although tired and hit on his head, Kochi got up and tried unsuccessfully to throw the nimble Saigo, who in turn scored another yama arashi in a failed ouchi gari attempt. This time, Kochi was thrown in a wrong angle and his shoulder was injured, which drove him to give up. * Hokken Sato from Kodokan fought Teisuke Nishimura from Totsuka, apparently winning the bout. * Katsutaro Oda from Kodokan is described as having fought a hikiwake or draw against an unidentified opponent. * Itsuro Munakata fought another unidentified opponent. According to both Yamashita and himself, he got carried by the success of his partners and attacked carelessly, which allowed his opponent to throw him down. As this was effectively an upset, both authors focus on it and skip the match's official result, but Tsuneo Tomita adds that the match kept on after the throw, with Munakata ultimately coming back and locking a juji-jime from the bottom for the win. In total, the Kodokan won the vast majority of the fights, with only a few draws and possibly a pair of losses. The exact number of bouts is unknown; although the large number of cited names supports the traditional estimation of 15, it doesn't establish a difference between fighters and cornermen, nor between tournament matches and possible inter-school special bouts. =Yokoyama-Nakamura match= Sakujiro Yokoyama. One of the best known bouts of the rivalry was the one pitting Sakujiro Yokoyama from Kodokan against Hansuke Nakamura, who was fighting at the Totsuka side in the search of retribution for his loss to Tomita. The match is consistently described by several authors, among them Nakamura's own assistant Ishibashi, but its date and place are less defined: it is traditionally considered by Western sources as yet another match of the Yayoi police tournament, but Yokoyama and Ishibashi present it as a separate individual challenge between the two contenders, hosted in the Marunouchi police station and also overseen by Mishima. The bout received an enormous deal of attention due to its surrounding circumstances. The 23 years old Yokoyama was known by his great size (173 cm and 86 kg) and had just defeated renowned Takenouchi Santo-ryu master Masaaki Samura in another previous duel.E. J. Harrison, The Fighting Spirit of Japan, 1955, W.Foulsham & Co. Ltd In contrast, while Nakamura had the disadvantage of being 12 years older, he was even larger than Yokoyama (being 176 cm and 94 kg himself) and had undergone a strenuous training since his defeat against Tomita, to the point he could now hang from his neck without feeling pain. The affair would be refereed by Tetsutaro Hisatomi and supervised by viscount Mishima again. Yokoyama opened the fight throwing Nakamura down with deashi barai. He was then about to pin him with kami-shiho-gatame, but Nakamura immediately reversed and pinned Yokoyama with his own kami-shiho-gatame. Although Sakujiro was able to escape with great effort and score a harai goshi that floored the jujutsuka, he did not follow him to the ground, as he now knew Hansuke was dangerous at ne-waza. Similarly, Hansuke remained on one knee on the ground challenging him to grapple, knowing Sakujiro was superior on the stand-up. From this point, the fighters continued trying to escape their opponent's field of strength while attempting to bring him to their own, until the draw was called at 55 minutes. In total, they fought half an hour standing and 25 minutes on the ground, and they were rendered so tired that the referee had to forcefully pry their numb fingers apart to separate them when the match ended. Despite the draw, Yokoyama received positive reviews for his performance and was given the nickname of . Nevertheless, he later wrote that he thought he was going to die during the bout, though also stated he was willing to do it. Anyway, as they match lacked a result, commentators settled it down by nicknaming Yokoyama as the and Nakamura as the . According to Ishibashi, Nakamura and Yokoyama formed a friendship after the match. Aftermath Jujutsu masters at the Butoku Kai, with Jigoro Kano at the center. Also featuring Hidemi Totsuka at Kano's right, and ≈åshima, Imai and Tanabe at the back row. The results of the police tournament were sound enough to convince Mishima of the superiority of the Kodokan method. The Metropolitan Police Department immediately requested the Kodokan to send teachers to their stations, with Yamashita and Yokoyama being the first ones, and those were increasingly favored over the ones from the Totsuka Yoshin-ryu. The latter lost its place in the martial landscape of Japan and faded gradually through the years while judo grew and became the dominant martial art in the nation. Their rise was such that Tsunejiro Tomita later compared the Kodokan‚ÄìTotsuka rivalry to the historical Battle of Sekigahara, where the regency of the Toyotomi clan and the regional power of the daimy≈ç were forced to pledge to the unified Tokugawa shogunate. He also wrote that \\"since the Kodokan's founding ten years ago, we have flattened the jujutsu nation across the country.\\" When the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai opened a jujutsu division in 1895, Kano was elected its chairman, and he personally led the standardization of the rules and katas over the rest of jujutsu schools of the country. Despite the victory, individual challenges continued for a while. According to Tsuneo Tomita, Yoshiaki Yamashita still defeated Taro Terushima in a rematch of their challenge bout, with the judoka winning by ippon seoi nage. Similarly, Yokoyama would beat his own rival Nakamura by harai makikomi in another rematch, after which Nakamura would join them as a guest for a multitudinous jujutsu exhibition, being paired with Yokoyama's former master Keitaro Inoue. Shiro Saigo, however, would face a final challenge from a Totsuka fighter, Shusaburo Sano, who outweighed him by 30 kg and was known for his strength feats. Sano countered Saigo's yama arashi and pinned him, but the judoka caught him in an ude-gatame from the bottom and forced him to give up. After those, as a sign of the influence of judo, Totsuka masters like Kinsaku Yamamoto would join the Kodokan and contribute to their techniques, as well as practitioners from other factions like Takeuchi Santo-ry≈´. With the Totsuka school removed from their horizon, the Kodokan school would never confront another large scale challenge from any jujutsu school. The only opposition of this kind they would face came from select masters of the Takenouchi-ry≈´ school, mainly Hikosaburo ≈åshima, K≈çtar≈ç Imai, Senjuro Kanaya and an associate from Fusen-ry≈´, Mataemon Tanabe. As they were not associated to the Totsuka faction, they still shared space with Kodokan teachers at the Metropolitan Police Department for years, producing several interschool matches with varied results. Tanabe himself became known for defeating multiple judokas thanks to his newaza expertise, though his faction ultimately failed to achieve popularity, and his apprentices would eventually become part of judo as well. His influence, however, remained in the rising kosen judo circuit.

Situated near the Oklahoma State Capitol, the original structure, designed by the architectural firm Layton, Hicks & Forsyth, was built between 1929-1930 as the home of the Oklahoma Historical Society and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Oklahoma Historical Society Building in 1990. The society moved to the nearby Oklahoma History Center when it opened in 2005. An annex was completed in 2011. Description The Oklahoma Judicial Center comprises the former Oklahoma Historical Society Building, also known as the Wiley Post Historical Building, and a newer adjacent annex located on the Capitol Park grounds of the Oklahoma State Capitol complex giving the center a combined floor space of . The Judicial Center occupies a lot bound between N. Lincoln Blvd. to the west and N. Lindsay Ave. to the east from NE 19th St. to NE 21st St. The Judicial Center annex is immediately adjacent facing N. Lindsay Ave. The Oklahoma State Capitol is located across N. Lincoln Blvd. to the northwest. The center is bounded to the south and east by the Capitol-Lincoln Terrace Historic District located across N. Lindsay Ave. and NE 19th St. =Exterior= The original Historical Society Building is a three-story structure with a full basement. The exterior features a facade of Indiana limestone with the base and steps composed of Georgia granite designed in Classical Revival style. The building is elevated six feet above Lincoln Blvd. which runs in front of the main entrance. Ten two-story tapered columns with Ionic capitals are aligned along the front facade between two square limestone end columns. The columns uphold an entablature inscribed with Oklahoma Historical Society in the center with three wreathes, symbolic of academic buildings, on each side. Above these along the lower edge of the cornice are dentils combined with egg and dart moulding as part of a frieze that includes lion masks. Atop the entablature lies the antefix featuring floral anthemions, one of the building's common motifs. A shallow porch with a beamed ceiling lies behind the Ionic columns. A porch rail is composed of short stone balustrades connecting the columns. Opposite the stairs leading to the porch are two centrally placed bronze entrance doors with a decorative iron grille clerestory. Alongside the entrance are vertical stone relief panels supporting an entablature and antefix resembling those on the front facade. Floral medallions alternate with vertebrate leaf bands to decorate the relief panels. From the porch, the granite steps descend in two wide flights separated by a small brick plaza. Three-dimensional volutes are on each side of the lower flight. Bays extend from the north and south ends of the building. The single, steel casement windows on the first and second floors alternate with plain stone pilasters along all elevations. On the front elevation, an intricate medallion design is located above first floor windows while second floor windows are adorned above with a scrolling foliage design. Windows on the side elevations are not decorated. Around the building is a belt course composed of a single row of dentils. On the front facade, each wing holds secondary entrances designed as simpler versions of the main entrance. These entrances are topped with simple entablatures with dentils and have windows on each side with exterior grilles resembling the clerestory over the main entrance. Light fixtures on each side of the secondary entrances complement the grilles and anthemions. The building's cornerstone is located on the northwest corner. The rear facade of the original building holds multi- pane windows larger than those along the other elevations. =Interior= A dominant interior feature of the Historical Society Building is the asymmetric central marble staircase and an intricate iron balustrade. The interior holds plaster walls decorated with elaborate friezes and parquet floors of marble, oak, and walnut. The halls of each of the unique floors are adorned with plaster pilasters with elaborate capitals and decorative friezes. These long corridors are laid with patterned marble with borders. The marble is added to the walls approximately a foot high as floor molding. The marble stairs have marble wainscotting on all levels. The stairway's iron balustrade incorporates a scrolling foliage design and a walnut banister. This foliage design at every level wraps a marble newel post. Despite the building's Neoclassical style, Art Deco light fixtures are employed at all levels. Seventeen- by seventeen- foot light courts illuminate the halls and service rooms of the upper floors and the former first floor library room. The basement contains beamed, coffered ceilings pronounced with dentils and a repeated vertical anthemion pattern. This level also is accented with intricate friezes, marble floors, and oak doors holding leaded oval glass and leaded clerestories. Located within the basement is a 400-seat auditorium including a stage decorated with swags and a false entablature, walls adorned with classical motifs, and large Art Deco chandeliers. Within the bronze main entrance doors are a second pair of brass-trimmed wooden doors with a stained glass Art Deco clerestory. In between these two door sets is a small entry vestibule laid with Tennessee and Tavernelle marble floors. The vestibule includes a frieze decorated with a scrolling foliage design and dentils. On the first floor between the vestibule and the central stairway is a reception area topped with an arched, vaulted ceiling. The pilastered first floor hallway features a frieze incorporating a wavescroll. On the second floor, the hall has beamed ceilings and pilasters capped with flattened Corinthian capitals. This floor has the most elaborate frieze composed of plaster festoons with a ribbon-wrapped design of leaves and flowers. This hallway is also adorned with egg and dart molding, dentils, and a secondary Art Deco design. The third floor hallway holds a plain beamed ceiling and pilasters with Corinthian capitals similar to those on the second floor. A special feature of the third floor is the wall paintings of eight Native American figures, the works by Kiowa artists Monroe Tsatoke and Spencer Asah, funded in the 1930s by the Civil Works Administration. The artists, members of the Kiowa Six, contributed their art to several state and federal buildings in Oklahoma. The third floor was originally constructed to be utilized as gallery space with the ceilings, holding skylights, curved to meet the walls. A small metal staircase on the south end of the hall climbs upward toward mechanical space. =Surrounding grounds= The front lawn of the building near the main entrance stairway holds a replica of the Liberty Bell, a cannon, and the architectural relic of a previously demolished downtown building. To the north of the original building is the Oklahoma American Legion War Memorial. This memorial features an eternal flame and four separate sculptures honoring veterans of World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. History The Oklahoma Historical Society, previously located since 1917 within the Capitol building, faced increasing competition for space in the Capitol from its own growth and that of other state agencies. Robert L. Williams, a judge and former state governor, promoted a bill in the Oklahoma Legislature to fund a new building for the society. Gov. William J. Holloway approved the legislation on March 1, 1929 resulting in construction commencing before the year ended. Under the new law, $500,000 was allocated for the construction of the building funded from the sale of school lands in the former Cherokee Outlet. Williams became chairman of the Building Committee tasked with selecting architectural and construction firms. After touring several cities around the country, the committee selected the Minnesota Historical Society Building in Saint Paul as a prototype. During the committee's fact-finding national tour, the committee was accompanied by architect Solomon Andrew Layton whose firm, Layton, Hicks & Forsyth, served as the building's architect as well as for several other properties on the National Register including the nearby Capitol building. Holmboe Construction Co. built the structure under the supervision of Edward P. Boyd. Construction was completed in 1930. Decorative lighting was installed around 1960 at the top of the front entrance steps on each side. Exhibit structures formerly on the property during the historical society's tenure included a capped oil well and other petroleum industry artifacts also installed around 1960 and an exhibit shop put in place in 1982. The war memorial site was dedicated on November 11, 1969 with the memorial constructed in 1986. The building's auditorium underwent restoration in 1982-1983. The Oklahoma Historical Society Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on February 21, 1990. Resources listed within the NRHP registration include the building itself as the sole contributing property while the non-extant exhibit shed and oil well were non-contributing resources. The registration's statement of significance cites the building's long-time role as a repository of the state's history and as an important example of the architectural works of Layton, Hicks & Forsyth. The Oklahoma Historical Society relocated to the Oklahoma History Center in 2005. In 2011, following a $35 million program involving the historic rehabilitation of the original building and the construction of the adjacent annex designed by TAP Architecture, the building reopened as the Oklahoma Judicial Center.

MAX Credit Union operates 18 locations in five counties in Central and East Alabama and as of January 2019 had US$1.34 billion in assets and 110,000 member owners. MAX is ranked the 4th largest credit union in Alabama in asset size and the 212th largest credit union in the US in asset size. MAX provides consumer and commercial financial services and is regulated and insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  History  MAX Credit Union was originally founded as Maxwell Federal Credit Union, a federally-chartered financial institution, on 27 April 1955 by 16 Air Force employees and enlisted personnel at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Maxwell Federal Credit Union opened for business on 27 June 1955. Membership was open to military and civil service personnel on Maxwell and Gunter Air Force Bases (now Gunter Annex) and only loans and savings accounts were offered. Maxwell Air Force Base Director of the Management and Training office Mamie S. Maples was the first president of the board of directors of Maxwell Federal Credit Union. The credit union had 144 customers and $62,000 in assets on 31 Dec 1955. Assets totalled $1 million in June 1963, $100 million in June 1982, and $200 million in May 1985. In June 1960, the credit union's name changed from Maxwell Federal Credit Union to Maxwell-Gunter Federal Credit Union and branches were opened on Maxwell and Gunter Air Force bases, in Prattville and at Montgomery Mall. In 1979 the credit union opened a fifth location at Eastdale Mall in Montgomery and began offering checking accounts. Maxwell- Gunter Federal Credit Union was renamed MAX Federal Credit Union in 1985. New branches were opened on Zelda Road and Vaughn Road in Montgomery in March 1985 and October 1986, and in the Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) building in March 1996. In June 1997, MAX opened a branch in Wetumpka, Alabama. On 25 February 1998, MAX Federal Credit Union received a community charter, which allowed anyone who lived, worked, or attended school in Montgomery, Autauga, and/or Elmore counties in Alabama to open accounts at MAX. MAX Federal Credit Union members voted to become a state-chartered financial institution in November 2007; this allowed the credit union to expand operations outside of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The credit union's name then changed to MAX Credit Union. Since 2007, MAX Credit Union has opened eight new locations in Montgomery, Prattville, Millbrook, Auburn, Opelika, Tallassee, and Troy, Alabama. MAX Credit Union opened MAX Leasing USA, a subsidiary commercial leasing company, in February 2009.  Products and services  MAX Credit Union offers personal and business banking products and services.  Community involvement  The MAX4Kids Foundation is a non-profit organization created in 2001 by MAX associates to raise funds for charitable organizations.

After his defeat he asked Chandos for financial help, but was refused on account of the losses Chandos had sustained in the South Sea Bubble. Hoskyns never stood for Parliament again.

Biography Oscar Philipp was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Wandsbeck, Germany. He was a cousin to Martha Bernays, the wife of Sigmund Freud. In 1901, his brother founded a small metal trading company in Hamburg, Germany where Oscar worked. In 1909, Oscar Philipp moved to London and established a metal trading company under the name of Philipp Brothers. Julius continued to run the German operation out of Hamburg. In 1914, with the advent of World War I, Siegfried Bendheim, an apprentice, German citizen, and minor partner in Philipp Brothers, avoided internment by the British government by moving to New York City where he established Philipp Brothers, Inc. Oscar was not affected by the war as he had previously obtained British citizenship. In 1923, another apprentice and second cousin to Bendheim, Siegfried Ullmann, moved to the New York office. In 1934, Julius moved Philipp Brothers' German operations to Amsterdam due to the rise of Nazi Germany and died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944. Philipp handled all contacts with the European market. The New York office eventually became Philipp Brothers headquarters. By the 1950s, Philipp Brothers had become the largest metal trader in the world. Philanthropy Philipp, a Hebrew scholar, was active in Jewish and Zionist causes. He served as a chairman of the Bachad fellowship; on the executive committee and council of British ORT; as a joint treasurer of Jews' College; as the treasurer of the London Board of Jewish Religious Education; and the founder of the Hebrew Publishing House. He was one of the founders of the Technion University in Haifa and Kibbutz Lavi. Personal life Phillip was married to Clarisse Weil; they had two sons, obstetrician Elliot Elias Philipp and Anthony Bertram Philipp. He died in Geneva, Switzerland.

It involves placing heated rocks into a water-filled container to heat the liquid to the point where it can be used to cook. This method of food preparation is a fuel-intensive process and it often requires the heating and reheating of stones before the water reaches an effective cooking temperature. Indigenous peoples in what is now Canada and the United States of America, especially on the West and Northwest Coast, used stone boiling. Cooking this way allowed for a more controlled temperature which made the extraction of fats and oils easier while also allowing for more nutrients to be obtained from such oils. Indigenous peoples first use of stone boiling, based on archaeological excavations in the Northern Plains, was dated at 4800 years ago. However, its use became more prominent between 250 C.E. and 1750 C.E.; Brian Reeves, professor of anthropology and archaeology at the University of Calgary, argued this is because of the need to feed increasing populations.  Materials  = Above-ground containers = Above-ground cooking vessels used in stone boiling consisted of: bark baskets and bark containers; pottery; as well as suspended animal paunches and hides. There are even instances of small canoes being utilized as cooking containers on the Northwest Coast for the preparation of whale fat. Indigenous peoples‚Äô usage of a given above-ground container type depended on the resources available to them. For example, First Nations on the Northwest Coast and eastern Canada are reported by Harold E. Driver, former professor of anthropology at Indiana University, and William Clifford Massey, former professor of anthropology at the University of Washington, to have used bark baskets and bark containers for stone boiling. However, bark baskets were preferred to bark containers because they did not burn as easily, which made them more durable. In eastern Canada among some Haudenosaunee peoples, large clay pots with thick walls were likely used for stone boiling. While such walls allowed for better insulation, Gregory Braun, professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto, attributed their thickness to the need to support the container‚Äôs structure without breaking, given the weight of the rocks inside. Plains peoples used suspended animal paunches in addition to below-ground boiling pits. = Below- ground containers = Plains peoples are reported by Jack W. Brink, curator of archaeology with the Royal Alberta Museum, and Bob Dawe, assistant curator of archaeology with the Royal Alberta Museum, to have used below-ground boiling pits because the wind cooled above-ground containers before the rocks could efficiently heat the water which made the already fuel-intensive process less effective and viable. At Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in what is now Alberta, Canada, bison hides were used to line pits that held the water. = Stones = Indigenous peoples‚Äô use of stone boiling involved heating stones in or near a hearth or fire before the rocks were transferred to a nearby water-filled container by using forked sticks. The rocks would then be removed from the container by using those forked sticks and bracing the stones to the side of the container. Rocks used in stone boiling were often fist-sized. This is because the heat that smaller stones were capable of transferring was not worth the resources required to reach such a temperature. As such, once a stone became smaller than 10 cm in any dimension, it was discarded. The reason stones would break is because of their repeated reheating, a process that could heat the rocks upwards of 500¬∞C. At Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, no complete boiling stones were found after eight seasons of excavation, which according to Jack W. Brink and Bob Dawe attests to the rocks being reused. The rocks in question are hypothesized by Brink and Mr. Dawe to have been imported from a nearby river, and were more predominant in stone boiling than the available sandstone because the river rocks would heat up more slowly and transfer their heat more slowly making it a better material for cooking.  Usage  = Purposes = Indigenous peoples used stone boiling to produce nut oil, bone grease, and cook vegetable and meat stews. While the process is fuel-intensive, stone boiling, according to Gerald Anthony Oetelaar, professor of anthropology and archaeology at the University of Calgary, and Alwynne B. Beaudoin, head curator at the Royal Alberta Museum, helped to alleviate the pressures of increasing populations as more nutrients could be extracted from existing food sources. Bone grease, in particular, served an economic purpose on the plains as it is used in the production of pemmican. Pemmican was an important trade item and storable food source. = Places = Stone boiling was used across North America, especially among West and Northwest Coast peoples. Indigenous peoples living between 33- and 58-degrees latitude, and 100- and 130-degrees longitude are generally associated with the use of stone boiling based on Kit Nelson‚Äôs, professor of anthropology at Tulane University, model of 152 ‚Äúcultural groups‚Äù drawn from three sources: the Database of North American Indians, Binford‚Äôs Hunter‚ÄìGatherer Database, and the eHRAF files. Access to the requisite fuels to heat stones is likely associated with stone boiling's use. For example, the Deg Hit'an and the Aleut used this cooking technique despite being above the 58-degrees latitude generalized threshold, which Harold E. Driver and William C. Massey attribute to their access to wood.

In addition to the commercial version of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve Studio), Blackmagic Design also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality, simply named DaVinci Resolve (formerly known as DaVinci Resolve Lite).  Development  = Original da Vinci Systems development (2003‚Äì2009) = The initial versions of DaVinci Resolve (known then as da Vinci Resolve) were resolution- independent software tools, developed by da Vinci Systems (based in Coral Springs, Florida), who had previously produced other color correction systems, such as da Vinci Classic (1985), da Vinci Renaissance (1990), and da Vinci 2K (1998). The system was first announced in 2003 and released in 2004. It began with three possible configurations: a digital intermediate (DI) color correction tool (known as Resolve DI), a visual effects tool (known as Resolve FX), and a 2K resolution processing tool (known as Resolve RT). These initial versions were integrated exclusively into dedicated hardware controllers. The systems leveraged parallel processing in an InfiniBand topology to support performance during color grading. This was initially implemented using proprietary hardware cards; however, the 4K resolution Resolve R series (such as the R-100, introduced in 2008, and the stereoscopic 3D R-360-3D, introduced in 2009) replaced this proprietary hardware with CUDA-based NVIDIA GPUs. In 2009, the Australian video processing and distribution technology company Blackmagic Design bought da Vinci Systems, retaining and expanding the engineering team for Resolve, but eliminating support-based contracts for the tool. In October 2009, Blackmagic Design CEO Grant Petty speculated in an interview that the price of Resolve could likely be reduced to below $100,000. = Blackmagic Design versions (2010‚Äìpresent) = At NAB 2010 in Las Vegas, in April 2010, Blackmagic Design announced three new pricing models for Resolve, with a new software-only macOS version retailing for $995, the macOS version with the Advanced Control Surface (previously branded as Impresario by da Vinci Systems) retailing for $29,995, and licenses for the Linux version (supporting multiple-GPUs for increased performance) retailing at $19,995 (with the most advanced configuration available retailing for under $150,000). Before this change, the pre-built versions of Resolve had been the only available options, selling for between $200,000 and $800,000, which was common industry practice at the time. In September 2010, version 7 (restyled as DaVinci Resolve) was the first to be released by Blackmagic Design under the new pricing model, and the first release for macOS. It included a redesigned user interface, Apple ProRes support, and support for the RED Rocket digital video decoder boards manufactured by Red Digital Cinema. The pricing model changes continued in June 2011 with the release of version 8: As part of this new version, Blackmagic Design announced a free, reduced-functionality edition of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve 8 Lite), alongside the continuing commercial options. Version 8 also introduced OpenCL acceleration support and XML integration with non-linear editor (NLE) applications. Subsequently, version 8.2 (December 2011) further expanded the scope of the software (which was previously only available for macOS and Linux) with the first release for the Windows platform, beginning with a public beta. Version 9 (2012) included redesigned user interface elements, added metadata editing options, and expanded the range of cameras and file types supported. The following year, version 10 was released, increasing the amount of information imported from XML, AAF and EDL files, and adding OpenFX plug-in, JPEG 2000 and AVI support. Version 10 was also the first version to include basic video editing features alongside the color correction functionality, such as the trimming of clips. Released in August 2014, version 11 added audio mixing, media organization features, and further video editing features, thereby enabling the software to function as a standalone non-linear editor (NLE) for the first time, in addition to integrating with other NLEs. DaVinci Resolve version 12 Subsequently, version 12 (announced at NAB 2015) added a new audio engine (supporting VST/AU plug-ins), and version 14 (2016) added an integrated version of audio editing software previously developed by Fairlight (following Blackmagic Design's acquisition of the company during the same year). The first version of Resolve for standard editions of Linux (version 12.5.5) was made available in 2017. This was also the first version in which a free Resolve version for Linux became available. Previous versions had required a custom build of Linux, use of the DaVinci Resolve Advanced hardware control panel, and a dedicated license dongle. Released in 2018, version 15 added an integrated version of the Fusion compositing and visual effects application, which was first developed in 1987 and had been acquired by Blackmagic Design in 2014. Blackmagic Design officially announced DaVinci Resolve version 16 at NAB 2019, in April 2019. Features introduced in version 16 include a dedicated 'Cut' page (to provide a more streamlined alternative to the 'Edit' page), machine learning functionality (Studio edition only) to handle repetitive tasks (e.g. facial recognition to sort clips by person), 3D audio within Fairlight, and new collaboration features (including Frame.io integration). The initial beta of version 16 was made available on the announcement date, and the final version of 16.0 was made available on 08 August 2019, alongside a beta for version 16.1.  Functionality  The software includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing/effects (including Fairlight), and visual effects (including Fusion). It can either be used as an intermediary between other NLE software and Digital Cinema Package (DCP) creation software, or as a standalone end-to-end video editing application. For content delivery to services such as Netflix, Resolve provides functionality to create and validate IMF (Interoperable Master Format, standardized by SMPTE) packages, known as IMPs (which comprise multiple components, such as MXF content, a composition playlist (CPL), and XML package data), without the use of separate DCP software. Compatible file formats include video formats such as AVI, MP4, QuickTime, DNxHD, and XAVC; data exchange formats such as XML, EDL, AAF, DCP, MXF, and CinemaDNG; audio formats such as AAC, AIFF, and WAVE; and image formats such as RAW, OpenEXR, TIFF, DPX, R3D, JPEG, and JPEG 2000. Supported plug-in types include OpenFX, VST, and AU. As of version 12.2 (December 2015), Resolve includes support for the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) standard for a high dynamic range. Other supported capabilities include OpenCL and Intel Quick Sync Video. = Studio edition = Unlike the free edition, the commercial edition of the software (DaVinci Resolve Studio) also supports resolutions greater than ultra-high-definition and frame-rates greater than 60 FPS. Other aspects of functionality only available in the commercial edition include support for multiple GPUs, additional OpenFX plug-ins (such as Face Tracking and Lens Flare), stereoscopic grading, video noise reduction, motion blur, HDR color grading, and user collaboration tools. The Studio edition is also the only edition to include the machine learning functions introduced as part of Resolve version 16. = Fairlight integration = Since version 14 (2016) DaVinci Resolve includes an integrated version of the software developed by Fairlight (now owned by Blackmagic Design), designed for TV & Film post-production, and live audio mixing. The Resolve-integrated software supports up to 1000 audio tracks, with a maximum of 6 inserts and 24 aux-sends per track. Other functionality includes 96-channel audio recording and 3D audio mixing for formats such as 5.1, 7.1 and 22.2. Integrated audio tools include compression/expansion, limiting, gating and parametric EQ. Fairlight software has been used in the production of TV shows, advertisements, and feature films, such as Logan and Murder on the Orient Express. = Fusion integration = Since version 15 (2018), DaVinci Resolve also includes an integrated version of the Fusion application for compositing and visual effects, also developed by Blackmagic Design. The core functionality of Fusion is based on a modular, node-based interface, with each node forming one specific aspect of the overall effects being implemented. This same interface style is present in the Resolve-integrated version. Prior to integration with Resolve, the standalone version of Fusion was used in the creation of effects for over 1,000 feature films and TV shows, such as The Martian, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2. = Mac App Store versions = There are versions of both DaVinci Resolve (the free edition) and DaVinci Resolve Studio available from the macOS App Store; however, some aspects of the application's functionality are not available from these versions, such as CUDA support, due to restrictions enforced by Apple.  Related hardware  The DaVinci Resolve Advanced Panel (previously known as Impresario). Since introducing software-only options for Resolve, Blackmagic Design have also released separate hardware control panels, designed to integrate with the Resolve software and provide users with a tactile interface and access to additional shortcuts. These panels include the DaVinci Resolve Micro Panel, the DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel (both released in 2017), and the DaVinci Resolve Advanced Panel (previously known as Impresario when manufactured by da Vinci Systems). In addition to the full control panels, Blackmagic Design also announced the Editor Keyboard for Resolve in April 2019. The Editor Keyboard includes a standard computer keyboard, alongside specific components for controlling the Resolve software (such as a dial for altering the timeline position), designed to support the use of 2 hands for editing tasks. Resolve also integrates with other hardware produced by Blackmagic Design, such as their 'Cintel' film scanner. In July 2018, Blackmagic Design released an external, portable graphics processing unit, named the eGPU, developed in association with Apple to leverage the Metal API for professional video and graphics (such as those used by DaVinci Resolve).  Reception  Davinci Resolve only had 100 users in 2009; however, since being acquired by Blackmagic Design, the software had a user base of more than 2 million using the free version alone as of January 2019. This is a comparable user base to Apple's Final Cut Pro X, which also had 2 million users as of April 2017. In 2011, DaVinci Resolve received a Red Dot award for 'Motion Picture Colour Grading System'. Version 14 received an additional Red Dot award in 2017 for 'User Interface Design, Post-Production Software', and in the same year, the software's newly released control panels, the Micro Panel and Mini Panel, also received Red Dot awards for 'Motion Picture Colour Grading System'. Version 14 also received a 2018 Good Design Australia Award, as did the DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel. In 2018, the Hollywood Professional Association (HPA) named DaVinci Resolve (version 15) as a recipient of their 2018 Engineering Excellence Awards.  Media produced using DaVinci Resolve  = Film = DaVinci Resolve has been used for the color grading and/or editing of feature films such as Alien: Covenant, Avatar, Best of Enemies, Deadpool 2, Jason Bourne, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, La La Land, Love & Mercy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Prometheus, Robin Hood, Spectre, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and X-Men: Apocalypse. DaVinci Resolve and Blackmagic Design hardware were used to create five of the eight 2019 Oscar nominated best picture films including Bohemian Rhapsody (most awards), The Favourite (most nominations), Roma (most nominations), Green Book (won Best Picture) and Vice. Additionally, DaVinci Resolve and Blackmagic Design hardware were used to create 13 2019 Oscar nominated films, 9 2017 Oscar nominated films, 7 2016 Oscar nominated films, 4 2014 Oscar nominated films, and 4 2010 Oscar nominated films (2 for Best Picture). 20 films at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival leveraged DaVinci Resolve, followed by 35 in 2016, over 45 in 2017, over 55 in 2018, and over 35 in 2019. Presence of films created with Resolve at other film festivals includes the 2018 Austin Film Festival (over 25 films), the 2014 Cannes Film Festival (3 films), the 2015 Cannes Film Festival (21 films), the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, and the 2016 and 2017 South by Southwest festivals. DaVinci Resolve has also been used in the restoration of classic films, such as Les Mis√©rables, Spartacus, Black Like Me, Jamaica Inn, and The Perfect Woman. = Television = DaVinci Resolve software has been used in television shows including 2 Broke Girls, American Horror Story, Arrow, Ash vs Evil Dead, The Big Bang Theory, Criminal Minds, Daredevil, The Flash, Gotham, How To Get Away With Murder, The Last Man on Earth, Lethal Weapon, The Man in the High Castle, The Mentalist, The Muppets, NCIS: Los Angeles, Orphan Black', Portlandia, Sons of Anarchy, Supernatural, The Walking Dead, and Westworld. The software has also been used in the creation of television shows which have received Emmy Awards, such as Game of Thrones and Modern Family. More than 55 of the 2018 fall television and streaming series relied on Blackmagic Design software and hardware, including DaVinci Resolve. = Other media = DaVinci Resolve has also been used during the creation of other media, such as music videos, advertisements, concert production, and online media.

When activated, it adjusts the stimulation of the heart based on the demand of the blood circulation system at any given time, and therefore, it will create the closest possible status to the natural physiologic demand for the heart beats. The program of this feature in automatic pacemakers is designed somehow that the built-in system can be over-ridden by the heart's natural rate at any moment that it gets back to a non-pathologic normal sinus rhythm and can reinitiate influencing the electric activity in the heart when the pathologic event happens again. A \\"ventricular-demand pacemaker\\" produces a narrow vertical spike on the ECG, just before a wide QRS. The spike of an \\"atrial-demand pacemaker\\" appears just before the P wave. Comparably, a Triggered Pacemaker is activated immediately after an electrical activity is commenced in the heart tissue by itself. A \\"ventricular triggered pacemaker\\" produces the impulse just after a pulse is created in the ventricular tissue and it appears as a simultaneous spike with QRS.

The album, which initially was intended to be released as Aquarius Rising, is noted for its usage of vocals, something rarely utilized in his previous recordings. According to Gerald Simpson, the album is an attempt for him to focus on melody and songwriting compared to his previous album Black Secret Technology. Background and production Production for the album began in 1996, and was originally intended to be issued through Simpson's personal Juice Box Records imprint under the title Aquarius Rising. In 1997, Simpson signed onto Island Records and the album was then planned to be issued through them, this however would change as the label's parent company, PolyGram Records, went through a change in Chairman and President, which caused artists such as Simpson to be dropped. Simpson has described the production for the album to be \\"therapeutic\\", as it helped him deal with his decision to leave behind Juice Box Records. His leaving was caused by the lack of funds he would receive from the label, which caused him to be unable to fix damaged equipment. This, along with the fact that he ran out of room for a suitable workplace in his apartment, caused him to leave his Manchester home. By 1998, Simpson moved out to the United States of America, where work recommenced on the album. By this point, Simpson was signed onto Studio !K7, an independent label from Germany which also has an office in New York City, where Simpson was living at the time.

Some of these stories are famous for being included in school textbooks. Works The stories in the Lotus Creek collection are primarily set during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Chinese Civil War. Below is a summary of some stories in the collection: ‚ÄúThe Reed Marshes‚Äù is about an old man who ferries supplies through a Japanese blockade to guerillas, ferries two young girls, one gets hit by a bullet and he takes out his revenge on a small group of Japanese soldiers \\"Lotus Creek\\" is about women who are left behind by their husbands who go off to fight. They try to follow their men to give them more supplies, but get chased by a Japanese ship, which is then ambushed by a squad including their husbands. \\"A Hamlet Battle\\" is, as is clear from the title, about resistance from a hamlet with the Chinese repelling a Japanese advance. It includes Chinese forces assisted by a local boy who knows his way around tunnels. The Chinese forces are victorious. \\"Caiputai\\" is about a Town where collaborators drive the price of grain high and buy goods cheap, but the people resist and steal a shipment of grain as part of the resistance In \\"Parting advice\\" a soldier gets leave from his leader to visit his family for one night. It is a touching reunion, but his father has died in the eight years he‚Äôs been away and he has a child he has never met. In the morning his wife takes him by sled back to his battalion. \\"Honor\\": Yuansheng is told by Xiumei that a nationalist deserter is alone with a gun so they steal it and Yuansheng goes off to war where he is fighting for 10 years. First the Japanese and then the nationalists. He is married before he leaves to a good- for-nothing who doesn‚Äôt want to wait for him. His wife gets in a fight with Xiumei and gets a divorce. Xiumei takes care of Yuansheng‚Äôs parents. He finally comes back and it seems as if this is a match made in heaven. \\"Haoerliang\\": A doctor and nurse take their wounded up into the mountains where the village chairwoman helps them.

He was raised in the community of Tokio in McLennan County, Texas, and took to guitar playing and singing when approximately twelve years old. He worked in various jobs, including horse training and driving a truck. About his work with animals, Hand said, ‚ÄúPeople act like it‚Äôs some big deal, like this whole horse whispering thing. But I‚Äôll tell you something ‚Äì you can whisper to ‚Äôem, you can get down on your knees and act like ‚Äôem, but the horse knows you ain't a horse.\\" Career As a teenager, Hand joined a small band and began performing in honky-tonks near his home of West, Texas. At some point he started to write and perform his own songs. After years of songwriting and performing locally in obscurity, he released his first album in 1997, when he was 45 years old. In 2014, Hand played a fictional version of himself in the independent film Thank You a Lot. The Austin Film Society's website noted that Hand and co-protagonist Blake DeLong, playing his son, had a chemistry that was \\"hilariously realistic\\". =Critical appraisal= Reviewers have generally emphasized the \\"authenticity\\" of Hand's songs. His music reportedly can match the \\"rigor\\" of historical performers of country music, \\"with the slightest touch of outlaw bluster,\\" while his voice can be \\"uncertain in moments.\\" On the release of his first album, one reviewer wrote that Hand \\"sings the songs as if he has lived every minute of them,\\" while The Washington Post's reviewer called him \\"the real deal,\\" a view shared also by Willie Nelson.

He is a Bing Professor in environmental science at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. His research interests mainly focus on plant-animal interactions, evolutionary ecology, and defaunation in the tropics of Latin America, Africa, and the Central Pacific. He was a member of the Committee on A Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards, co-authoring the framework in 2012, and continues to educate local communities and young people about science and environmental issues.  Early life and education  Dirzo was born in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.Interview with Rodolfo Dirzo (11/3/18) He received his Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM) in 1972, where he did thesis work on vegetation mapping of a watershed north of Mexico City. After receiving his bachelor's degree, Dirzo worked in the lab of Professor Jos√© Sarukh√°n, a renowned tropical ecologist, at UNAM for a few years. As a research assistant for Dr. Sarukh√°n, Dirzo worked on a long-term tree demography study collecting data on tree characteristics over time to eventually determine how humans impacted tree population dynamics. He obtained his MS and PhD degrees, both in Ecology and both under prominent plant ecologist John Harper, from the University of Wales, UK in 1977 and 1980, respectively. Inspired by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and his mentors, Sarukh√°n and Harper, Dirzo decided to focus his graduate work on how animals influence plant ecology and evolution, and more specifically on the evolution of anti-herbivore defenses in plants. His master's thesis and dissertation examined how the white clover (Trifolium repens) may have developed increased cyanogenic properties as an adaptation to herbivory by slugs.  Career  Throughout his career, Dirzo has held many professional appointments, serving as a professor, director, chairperson, and coordinator for multiple institutions. In 1983, he became a professor with the Instituto de Biolog√≠a at the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station in Veracruz, Mexico. He was later appointed director of Los Tuxtlas in the mid-1980s and began researching patterns of herbivory in the area. After his time at Los Tuxtlas, Dirzo returned to UNAM as a professor with the Instituto de Ecolog√≠a, where he taught for 16 years. Dirzo currently teaches ecology, natural history, and conservation science in the Biology Department at Stanford University, where he has been an instructor since 2005. While at Stanford, he also served as director for the Center for Latin American Studies (2010-2016) and co-director of the INOGO Program of the Woods Institute for the Environment (2011-2017).  Research  = Herbivory and Defaunation in Mexico = After finishing his graduate programs, Dirzo went back to Mexico, where he hoped to determine if the same concepts he examined in his graduate work could explain plant-animal interactions in tropical ecosystems. As director of the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station, he began analyzing amounts of herbivory in the region and found no evidence of mammalian herbivory. This led him to believe mammalian herbivores were relatively unimportant for tropical forests. In 1992, Dirzo received a Marine Fellowship from the PEW Fellows Program in Conservation and the Environment, which he used to develop a research laboratory at the Chajul Field Station in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. He used this reserve and research station to continue his work on herbivory patterns. He found that in Montes Azules, where human encroachment was not impacting the area as it was in Los Tuxtlas, there were blatant signs of mammalian herbivory. His research in these areas led him to understand that, contrary to his hypothesis, mammals were important to tropical ecosystems, and that Los Tuxtlas was experiencing defaunation (loss of fauna), most likely due to anthropogenic causes. Dirzo pioneered the study on the impacts of humans on defaunation and illuminated the importance of ecosystem services provided by mammalian herbivores to lower trophic levels (i.e. plants) in the tropical ecosystem. = Expanding to Africa and beyond = In more recent years, Dirzo has carried his research on to other parts of the world, researching how defaunation is impacting these regions, as well. In the African savanna, Dirzo studied how defaunation leads to an increase in the population of rodents due to loss of medium and large vertebrates that either directly prey on rodents or consume rodent habitat (i.e. grass). Since rodents are known disease reservoirs, one major consequence of this is an increase in disease transmission, especially since defaunation usually occurs in highly populated areas (however, he also finds that effects of defaunation can vary based on secondary land use employed). Currently, Dirzo is ‚Äúconducting a review analysis to assess the consistency of differential defaunation across the globe‚Äù. Additionally, he is working with Mexico's national commission for biodiversity (CONABIO) on a countrywide evaluation of biodiversity across Mexican ecosystems, while also looking at how defaunation may be increasing animal-to-human disease transmission (AKA zoonosis) in Mexico.  Community Involvement  Besides teaching and conducting research, Dirzo also works to educate young people and local communities about science and the environment. In the San Francisco Bay Area, he is involved with projects that target minorities and underprivileged groups, such as the Redwood Academy of Leadership (REAL), Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for Latina Girls, and Stanford Science for the East Palo Alto Academy. These programs aim to give children and young adults the chance to participate in hands-on science education, observe how science professionals operate, and possibly inspire their future careers. When visiting his field sites in other countries, he also seeks to teach the local communities, especially children, about the importance of the region's biodiversity and environmental stewardship.  Honors and awards  Dirzo has been recognized for his contributions to the ecological, academic, and conservation fields in the United States and Mexico.

Logistical bottlenecks increase the cost of production of our goods by about 30 percent\\" Public infrastructure in Pakistan has made some progress over the last five decades. However, compared to other similar countries, the rate of improvement in Pakistan has been among the slowest for the majority of public infrastructure sectors. Infrastructure Pakistan‚Äôs infrastructure is underused because the economic boom was not quiet enough for indias competitionit was meant to trigger has never arrived. Over the past three years, the government has successfully staved off a balance-of-payments crisis, achieving some measure of macroeconomic stability. At the time of partition in Independence, Pakistan got almost a wasteland and most of the developed areas came under the territory of India. So, Pakistan had to work for the primary foundation of infrastructure. The comparatively poor infrastructural situation of Pakistan by international standards has a severe effect on the lives of people. The electricity shortages, lack of proper water and sanitation provisions. Above all, the increase in population to an alarming level is making our problems worse. The Government of Pakistan and its people face an uphill battle against poor infrastructure. According to the World Economic Forum Survey (2006-07) of 125 countries, Pakistan ranked 67th in the basic infrastructure category. Historically, a continual imbalance between demand and supply of infrastructure facilities is seen. In The Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2012-2013, released by the World Economic Forum, Pakistan is graded among the bottom 20 of the 144 economies around the world. Pakistan lacks a long-term view of competitiveness in accordance with this report. Industry Pakistan, which had almost no large industrial units at the time of partition in 1947, now has a fairly broad industrial base, and manufacturing accounts for about 17 percent of GDP. Cotton textile production is the single most important industry, accounting for about 19 percent of large-scale industrial employment. Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, made-up textiles, ready-made garments, and knitwear collectively accounted for nearly 60 percent of Pakistan's exports in 1999-2000. Other important industries are cement, vegetable oil, fertilizer, sugar, steel, machinery, tobacco, paper and paperboard, chemicals, and food processing. The government is attempting to diversify the country's industrial base and to increase the emphasis on export industries. Small-scale and cottage industries are numerically significant but account for a relatively small proportion of the GDP at about 6 percent. Small-scale industry includes facilities, which employ fewer than 50 workers, and cottage industries (industrial units in which the owner works and is aided by family members but employs no hired labor). In 1999, industrial production grew by 3.8 percent. Since the mid-1960s, the industrial sector has produced 19 to 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for 24.5 percent of GDP in 2004. Manufacturing and construction dominate the industrial sector, accounting for around 19 percent of GDP. Since the 1980s, approximately 17 to 20 percent of the working population has been employed in the industrial sector (25 percent in 2004), mostly in manufacturing and construction. Although the industrial base has diversified since independence, the production base depends heavily on textiles and sugar. Manufacturing output is therefore vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in international prices for cotton and sugar. Various liberalization reforms have been pursued since the early 1980s but have been hindered by substantial corruption, frequent raw material shortages, the government‚Äôs tendency to provide generous concessions to particular sectors (such as sugar refining and yarn spinning), and a burdensome tax structure that has helped promote the development of the informal economy.

A radial engined variant of the original Lavochkin- Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3, the Gu-82 was intended to alleviate the performance shortcomings of its predecessor already employed by Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily (VVS) in the initial phases of World War II. Design and development =Background= In 1939 the Soviet government believed that it was necessary to modernize the VVS, which had been using the radial engine Polikarpov I-16 and I-153. They issued a specification for a new generation of aircraft, characterized by higher overall performance, equipped with high-powered liquid cooled V-12 engines. Four OKBs presented proposals, three of which were approved and launched for series production, the Yakovlev Yak-1, Lavochkin- Gorbunov-Gudkov I-22, and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1. The I-22, later redesignated LaGG-1, was found to be unsuitable and in need of technical improvements, but was nevertheless ordered to be developed, as it was almost entirely made of non-strategic materials, although only 100 were built. Even the LaGG-1s successor, the LaGG-3, continued to suffer from a series of problems that were reflected in the overall performance of the aircraft in combat, mainly related to the maximum speed, which on production aircraft was lower than the prototypes tested by the VVS. The lack of confidence in the potential of the aircraft by the pilots was summarized in the nickname they assigned: the initials LaGG, identifying designers Lavoƒçkin, Gorbunov, and Gudkov became lakirovanny garantirovanny grob (\\"guaranteed painted casket\\"). =Development= Mihail Ivanovich Gudkov, who together with Semyon Lavochkin and Vladimir Petrovich Gorbunov had collaborated on the design of the aircraft, believed that a quick remedy to the shortcomings of the LaGG-3 was a new engine, the Shvetsov ASh-82 (also known as M-82) radial. The new unit developed more power than the Klimov M-105 in the LaGG-1/3; moreover, at the expense of a slightly higher frontal area, it enjoyed the advantage of continuing to operate in the event of one of the cylinders being shot out. On 25 August 1941, Gudkov was allocated an engine and began installation into an LaGG-3, so increasing the offensive firepower by installing 2x Berezin UB machine-guns and 2x ShVAK cannon. The aircraft, given the official designation Gu-82, was flown successfully on 11 September 1942, when it was found that the maximum speed, attested to , was slightly higher than its predecessor, the agility was also significantly increased. Gudkov presented the results to Stalin and advocated the establishment of a new production line, news that was greeted with enthusiasm by the pilots who had the hope of having an aircraft more suitable to fight against the Luftwaffe. However, Lavochkin had developed another variant of the LaGG-3 with a radial engine, the Lavochkin La-5, which proved to be far superior, thus the development of the Gu-82 was cancelled.

In a number of official documents the college was termed the Tsarskoe Selo Forestry Institute. * In January 1811 the Tsarskoe Selo Forestry Institute was transferred to Saint Petersburg's north-bank Vyborg Side (placing the college in the wooden buildings of an old farm). After the Orloff Forestry Institute (founded in 1808 by Director of State Woods Orloff) was added, it was renamed the Forst-Institut. * In 1813 the Forst-Institut was combined with Kozelsk Forestry Institute (founded in 1804). The joint educational establishment was styled the Saint-Petersburg State Forestry Institute. * In 1826‚Äî1833 the architects I. F. Lucchini (–ò. –§. –õ—É–∫–∏–Ω–∏) and A. Nellinger (–ê. –ù–µ–ª–ª–∏–Ω–≥–µ—Ä) erected four separate academic buildings. * In 1829 the Forst-Institut was renamed the Forestry Institute, and the length of study was increased from 4 to 6 years, and it opened admission to children aged 10 to 14. * In 1837 the Saint-Petersburg Forestry Institute reformed into a military school named the Forestry and Surveying Institute. * In 1862 Forestry and Surveying Institute closed down, and the Forestry Academy was formed. * In 1863‚Äî1864 buildings of Agricultural Institute were transferred from Gora-Gorki to the Forestry Academy, and the Saint-Petersburg Agricultural Institute was set up with two departments: Agronomy and Forestry. * In 1865 the Forestry Academy closed down. * In November 1877 the Agronomy Department of the Agricultural Institute closed down in connection with the Forestry Department's transformation into Saint-Petersburg Forestry Institute * In 1914 the Saint-Petersburg Forestry Institute renamed the Petrograd Forestry Institute. * In 1924 it was renamed the Leningrad Forestry Institute. * On November 26, 1929, a decree of the Central Executive Committee (–í–¶–ò–ö) transformed the institute into an academy. * On September 27, 1935, the Academy was named after the assassinated Sergey Kirov. * On October 15, 1953, a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded the Academy an Order of Lenin. * On February 13, 1992, the Leningrad Forestry Academy was renamed the Sergey Kirov Saint Petersburg Order of Lenin Forestry Academy. * On July 26, 1993, it was renamed the Sergey Kirov Saint Petersburg Forestry Academy. * On April 30, 1997, it was renamed the State Higher Education Institution Sergey Kirov Saint Petersburg Forestry Academy. * On February 10, 2011, it was granted the status of a university.

She is an ecosystem, forest, and wetlands ecologist who has worked in Florida for much of her career, focusing much of it on cypress swamps, pine plantations, and mangrove forests in the Pacific. Ewel served as the vice-president of the Society of Wetland Scientists in 2003, becoming president in 2004 and now since 2005, a past president. She has now retired and lives near Gainesville, Florida.  Early life  Ewel was born on September 30, 1944 in Glens Falls, a small town in the foothills of the Adirondacks in New York State.Personal Communication - Email - 11/14/18 The outdoors always drew her, often visiting a cabin on Lake George, hiking and exploring with family members. At first, Ewel sought to be a journalist, but after taking a biology course in her high school, her new goal was set, and was guided towards ecology by her classwork at Cornell.  Career  Ewel graduated from Cornell University in 1966 with a degree in Zoology, and completed her PhD in Zoology at the University of Florida in 1970. She became a professor at University of Florida's School of Forest Resources and Conservation, working there for over 20 years, making research contributions in wetland, upland forest, and lake ecology and management, until she was hired by the USDA Forest Service's Institute of Pacific Islands in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1994. While in charge of the Institute's Wetlands Team, she led research projects on mangrove forests and other wetlands in the Pacific Micronesia. As a result of the extent of her work, she became a Fellow of the Society of Wetlands Scientists, serving as its vice-president in 2003, before becoming president in 2004. She retired from the Forest Service in 2005 and moved back to the Gainesville, Florida area, but never left her work in the Pacific behind, continuing to write academic articles on her work and data collected in the Pacific, and becoming a Society of Wetland Scientists' past president in 2005.  Major research contributions  Ewel has worked on a range of ecosystems, but a large part of her career was focused on cypress swamps and mangrove forests in the pacific. She was a big proponent of the application of computer models/simulations in ecology to predict what may affect the studied ecosystems in the future. = Cypress swamps = Wetlands were the focus of most of Ewel's career, but much of her early work revolved around cypress swamps, culminating in the release of her book Cypress Swamps in 2001. Her work on cypress swamps began in 1972, she evaluated the possibility of cypress swamps being used as treatment wetlands for municipal sewage, combining and analyzing the results of her work with studies done throughout wetlands swamps in the southeastern U.S. Her book, Cypress Swamps, describes the characteristics of cypress swamps as a whole, but incorporated her research and others' to examine their usefulness in human society and their broader ecological context. Her research presented in this book was novel in the way it used computer simulations in coordination with field and lab data to predict what may affect wetlands such as these in the future. = Pine plantations = Another focus of her career while at the University of Florida were pine plantations, a major land use in Florida with approximately 32% of forested lands in the state being pine plantations. Ewel used computer models throughout her research and it has been a focus of her career, eventually teaching a class on it at the University of Florida, and this hold true for her research on pine plantations. Ewel constructed a model to predict leaf area of slash pine stands through climate conditions in the previous spring and the stand's basal area, which is useful for determining the light penetration in pine plantations that might be seen depending on various climatic conditions that a plantation could encounter in the future. Furthermore, she modeled CO2 evolution in the soils of pine plantations, discovering that by far, live root respiration was the most significant factor in soil CO2 evolution of these plantations. Ewel contributed to the making of the book, Agroforestry: Realities, Possibilities, and Potentials, published in 1987. She continues to use the things she learned in her research today, as in retirement she owns a pine plantation in northern Alachua County, Florida. = Mangroves and other tropical wetland forests = When she joined the USDA Forest Service's Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, she led the Wetlands team's research on mangrove forests and forested peatlands in the Pacific. While working in the Pacific, Ewel researched and described the structure of mangrove forests and trees in Micronesia, publishing an academic paper on it in 1999. Furthermore, she studied the effect the formation of gaps in the forest canopy in pacific islands's mangrove forests would have on the ecosystem, finding that large gaps may have large impacts in dryer mangrove forests. One of her most cited papers, \\"Different kinds of mangrove forests provide different goods and services\\", discusses three types of mangrove forests; fringe forest, riverine forest, and basin forest, each with their own unique ecological service. Ewel wrote that fringe forests provide storm protection for ecosystems and land along coasts, while riverine forests are most valuable for plants and animals as it has the highest productivity, and basin forests are an important nutrient sink. Ewel also wrote about the importance of monitoring the effects of anthropogenic processes and climate change on the invertebrate, plant, and fungi that are so important in the maintenance of marine critical zones such as estuaries and coastal wetlands as their diversity is important for keeping the ecosystems functioning and supporting a much larger range of biota. Ewel continues to write academic papers on Pacific wetlands after retiring in 2005, and her most cited academic contribution \\"A World Without Mangroves\\" was published in 2007, and highlights the danger of losing the mangrove ecosystem in the future as, when the journal article was written, 1-2% of mangroves were being lost every year.

As a child, Cordner-Pinkerton contracted rheumatic fever, which resulted in a weakened heart and effected her health for her entire life. For a time after her father's death, she taught music. On 31 January 1894 she married Rev. Samuel Pinkerton who was the minister of 1st Newry Presbyterian church. Samuel added his wife's name to his own, which was rather unusual for the time. Both of them were interested in Irish nationalism, particularly in the work of John Mitchel and John Martin. In 1897 Cordner-Pinkerton began publishing with the first of five annuals, The open window. They contained local interest, Irish language and historical articles, reflections on life at the time, as well as advertising. The annuals contained many photographs, with some taken by Cordner-Pinkerton and her husband. Alongside her publishing, she also conducted her duties as a minister's wife. The couple had two sons and two daughters. The multiple pregnancies further weakened her heart, and she died of heart failure on 2 August 1902.

He currently holds the appointment (2010) as the Director of the Consortium for Understanding and Sustaining a Biodiverse Planet at the Smithsonian and is the former Executive Director of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.  Early life and education  Kress received his education at Harvard University (B.A.,1975) and Duke University (Ph.D., 1981), studying tropical biology, plant systematics, pollination ecology, and ethnobotany. Kress' travels to tropical regions began as a graduate student where he conducted post-doctorate research in Columbia. His dissertation was mainly focused on the plants in genus Heliconia. Kress focused on both the systematics and the plant-animal interactions of this group. His research later took him to Las Cruces Botanic Garden in San Vito where he studied what factors may prevent species hybridization. He is responsible for the collection of many of the Zingiberales from around the country that exist in the botanic garden today.  Research  Kress is now the vice-president of science at the National Museum of Natural History, where he formerly held positions of Curator and Chairman of the Department of Botany. Kress worked formerly as the director of research at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Florida from 1984 to 1988. Focusing mostly on the Zingiberales, including Heliconia, Musa, and other gingers, Kress has extensively studied the systematics and plant animal interactions of this order. His current research is focused on biodiversity genomics, conservation, and the Anthropocene. Kress' publications regarding the anthropocene warn that human created complexes, still-to-be-resolved issues, including the impacts of climate change, will endanger humanity's future if they are not addressed immediately. = Tropical plant dversity = Kress is responsible for the variety of Heliconias in Las Cruces Botanic Garden as well but a garden planted in an enclosed aviary in Dominica‚Äôs mountains. The main purpose of this garden was so that he and his colleagues could watch the hummingbirds interact with plants in an experimental situation. He claims that seeing that symbiosis between Heliconia and hummingbirds allowed him to gain deeper understanding of the mechanism of evolution. = Systematics and taxonomy = Published findings by Kress include the lineages of and the divergence of Zingiberales. His research found that speciation from the remaining monocots occurred approximately 124 million years ago. In addition to discovering that major family-level lineages become established in the late Cretaceous (80-110 mya), his research also found that crown lineages within families began diversifying in the early to mid-Tertiary (29-64 mya). He aided in developing an award- winning smart-phone app, Leafsnap, and works as the Principal Investigator of the Leaf Project at the Smithsonian. It is the first mobile tree identification smart-phone app was a collaboration between Columbia University and the University of Maryland. = Conservation = His role in collection management at the Smithsonian Institution has made him an spokesman for the importance of collections, explaining how the worldwide decline of specimens in the natural world increases their inherent value. He claims that as the world ages and the natural world changes, museum collections serve as a record for phenology as well as preserve beyond nature. Many of his publications advocate for the conservation of tropical plants, specifically, Zingiberales. Kress is an advocate for a biodiverse future, and serves on a panel that asks difficult questions about sustainability. His role as the director of the Consortium for Understanding and Sustaining a Biodiverse Planet at the Smithsonian Institution has made him a proponent of humans living sustainably prior to irreversible damage occurring to the planet. The consortium originated from a strategic 10-year plan put in place by the Smithsonian Institution to create interdisciplinary work by scholars both related and not related to the Institution. Sustained by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the consortium promotes interactions between scholars in complementary fields and have resulted in the facilitation of new avenues of thought in scientific endeavors. Kress, as Director of the Biodiversity and Sustainability Consortium, brings together scientists from numerous fields to address broad research projects which dive deep into questions on biology with relevant societal impacts. Museum collections that Kress manages have aided in advancement of knowledge and understanding of both life on the planet and how it can be sustained.

It took place ahead of the presidential election that November, and the state's Democratic primary was held on the same day. Donald Trump won the primary, with 38.8% of all votes cast. Marco Rubio came in second, with 24.5% of the vote, and Ted Cruz came in third, with 23.6% of the vote. Of Georgia's 76 bound delegates, Trump, Rubio, and Cruz took home 42, 16, and 18, respectively. Mr. Trump's campaign in the Deep South had a racial edge, and Georgia was one of five states (and three Super Tuesday states) that had backed segregationist George Wallace in the 1968 Presidential election. State of the campaign Leading up to Super Tuesday, Trump was already the front-runner, thanks in part to his commanding victory in the South Carolina primary. Despite this, Trump still needed many more delegates to clinch the nomination, and the large number of delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday made that day's contests especially important. Politico's Kyle Cheney noted that \\"Super Tuesday could cripple every Republican presidential candidate not named Donald Trump,\\" while also observing that Trump would almost certainly remain ahead of all his Republican opponents after the day's primaries and caucuses. Georgia's 76 delegates were the second-most of any state that held a Republican primary or caucus on Super Tuesday in 2016. This may have influenced Trump to hold a controversial rally in Valdosta the day before Georgia's primary. Because Georgia requires candidates to reach a 20% threshold to receive any of its delegates, this was seen as potentially problematic for Cruz and Rubio, both of whom had been polling around that threshold in Georgia at the time. Nevertheless, there was speculation before Super Tuesday that Rubio would do better in Georgia's primary than in that day's other primaries. Opinion polling Polls conducted shortly before the Georgia primary gave Trump a double-digit lead over his opponents in the state. For instance, a poll conducted on February 28 by WSB-TV and Landmark Communications gave Trump a 19-point lead over his closest rival, Marco Rubio. A CBS News poll before the primary similarly found that Georgia Republicans \\"overwhelmingly\\" perceived Trump as being on the side of ordinary people, rather than wealthy donors, while they perceived Rubio in the opposite light. Delegate allocation 76 delegates were at stake in the Georgia Republican primary. Of these, 10 were at-large delegates, 42 were district delegates who each represented one of the state's 14 congressional districts, three were Republican Party leaders, and 21 were bonus delegates. The 42 delegates corresponding to Georgia congressional districts were all bound, whereas the remaining 34 were unbound. The delegates were awarded according to a winner-take-most system. The winner of each congressional district in the state received all three of that district's delegates if they received a majority of the vote in the district. Results Trump won the Georgia primary with about half a million votes, representing 38.8% of all votes cast. He won 42 of the state's 76 delegates. Trump won 155 out of Georgia's 159 counties. The only four he did not win were Clarke, Cobb, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, all of which Rubio won comfortably. Trump's strongest performance was in Atkinson County, where he received 65.9% of the vote. Analysis Trump's victory in the Georgia primary, as well as in most other Super Tuesday states, was seen as a bad sign for Cruz's campaign, as Cruz himself had described Super Tuesday as \\"the single most important day in the entire Republican primary.\\" Rubio's poor performance in the primary was also bad news for his campaign, since the suburbs of Atlanta and Savannah had high numbers of professional voters who had been viewed as inclined to support him.

He was driven into exile in Dublin, along with two of his brothers, by the Norman conquest of England, and from there he twice led expeditions to south-western England, but with little success. He disappears from history in the early 1070s.  Parentage and upbringing  Godwin's precise date of birth is unknown, but it was probably in the mid- to late 1040s. His family was one of the most powerful in Anglo-Saxon England: his paternal grandfather was Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his father was Harold Godwinson, who would soon inherit the same title. His mother, Edith Swan-neck, was married to Harold more danico, \\"in the Danish manner\\", that is to say they had a form of marriage which was not recognized by the Church but which was at the time widely considered legitimate among the laity. Harold Harefoot, for example, succeeded to the throne despite being the son of such a marriage between king Cnut and √Ülfgifu of Northampton. Harold Godwinson had five sons, probably not by the same mother, but several pieces of evidence combine to indicate that Godwin was the eldest; namely, that he is the only one recorded in Domesday Book as holding land in 1066, he was named first by the chronicler John of Worcester when listing Harold's eldest sons, and he was the one named after Harold's father. Godwin can be presumed to have received an education befitting the son of a great nobleman, with the emphasis on gaining military and diplomatic skills, and though he was apparently too young to fight for his father, now king of England, at the Battle of Hastings, he had opportunities to use these skills in the next few years.  Resistance in south-west England  Harold Godwinson's defeat and death at Hastings were a disaster for his family, especially since the Anglo-Saxon magnates in London responded by electing as king not one of Harold's sons but Edgar √Ütheling, a great-nephew of Edward the Confessor. Edgar's brief \\"reign\\" ‚Äì he was never actually crowned ‚Äì ended when William the Conqueror reached London in December 1066. Godwin Haroldson's grandmother Gytha, the widow of Earl Godwin, retreated to the south-west of England to consolidate her power in that still unconquered part of the country, but at the beginning of 1068 William led his army against her, and besieged her in Exeter. Godwin is not specifically mentioned in contemporary sources as being part of this south-western rebellion, but it is very likely that he and his brothers Edmund and Magnus were there, asserting their claim to be leaders of the Anglo-Saxon opposition. After eighteen days Exeter submitted to William, but by that time Gytha, and perhaps her grandchildren, had escaped and taken refuge on an island in the Bristol Channel, probably Steep Holm.  Raids from Ireland  That summer Godwin was in Dublin under the protection of king Diarmait of Leinster, who had many years previously given refuge similarly to his father. Godwin was accompanied by his brothers Edmund and Magnus, if we are to believe the chronicler John of Worcester, or by Edmund and his first cousin Tostig (a son of Swein Godwinson) if we believe the Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar. They seem to have had Harold Godwinson's remaining housecarls in their service, and still had the resources to make Diarmait gifts such as the \\"battle standard of the king of the Saxons\\" mentioned by the Annals of Inisfallen, and to hire a force of mercenaries. With a fleet of 52 ships they sailed to the Bristol Channel and first harried the area around the mouth of the river Avon, then attacked Bristol, and after being driven off by the townspeople they sailed back to the Somerset coast and landed again. They may have expected a welcome there and planned to recruit more men, since Godwin's only landholdings at the death of Edward the Confessor had been two small manors in Somerset at Nettlecombe and Langford-in-Burrington, but if so they were disappointed. They encountered a local force under the command of Eadnoth the Staller which fought a bloody battle with them at Bleadon. Eadnoth was one of the fatalities, and possibly also Godwin's brother Magnus. After harrying Devon and Cornwall Godwin returned to Dublin, richer but having won no great military success. In the summer of 1069 another raid was launched from Dublin, but this time, the sources tell us, by only two of the sons of Harold, whom they do not name. This time they sailed in 64 ships to Exeter, which they failed to take, and then ravaged parts of the south coast of Devon and perhaps the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall before rounding Land's End and landing, \\"incautiously\\" as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says, in the estuary of the river Taw on the north coast of Devon. After pillaging the area around Barnstaple they took their forces into the hinterland and encountered an army under the command of Brian of Brittany, which, to quote the Chronicle again, \\"slew all the best men from the [brothers'] troops while the few survivors escaped to their ships\\". The two raids had been politically and militarily disastrous, and had only demonstrated that the memory of their father's reign could not gain them any supporters in the south-west.  Flanders to Denmark  It is likely that Godwin and Edmund accompanied their sister Gytha, aunt Gunnhild, and grandmother Gytha when they fled to St Omer in Flanders in, perhaps, late 1069 or early 1070. It is certain that they later went on to the court of king Swein Estrithson in Denmark, along with the younger Gytha. They doubtless hoped that Swein would support them in an invasion of England, but he did not; Swein had recently failed badly in a similar attempt on his own behalf and he can have had little inclination to try again on theirs, especially since there was bad blood between the two families, Swein's brother having long ago been murdered by a brother of Harold Godwinson. Gytha was married off to Vladimir Monomakh, Prince of Smolensk, probably in 1074 or 1075, but of Godwin's later life nothing is known with certainty. One theory, proposed by the historian , is that he moved further east and found shelter in Ruthenia, where either he or a son of his carved out a principality.

After harrying Devon and Cornwall the surviving brothers returned to Dublin, richer but having won no great military success. It is, to sum up, uncertain if Magnus took part in this raid, and if he did take part it is uncertain whether he survived it. There is no further explicit mention of Magnus by any contemporary source, but it is recorded that two unnamed sons of Harold made a second raid on south- west England in the summer of 1069 which ended with a disastrous battle fought in Devon against the forces of Brian of Brittany, resulting in the deaths of \\"all the best men\\" of the brothers' expedition.  Tradition of his survival  The Magnus inscription One possible clue hints that Magnus may have survived these events and gone into religious retirement in Sussex, the original home of the House of Godwin. An ancient monument now built into an outer wall of the Church of St John sub Castro, Lewes has a Latin inscription which has been translated thus: > There enters this cell a warrior of Denmark's royal race; Magnus his name, > mark of mighty lineage. Casting off his Mightiness he takes the lamb's > mildness, and to gain everlasting life becomes a lowly anchorite. A tradition recorded in the early 19th century states that this was Magnus Haroldson, and certainly he was a relation of the Danish royal family through his greatuncle Ulf, father of King Sweyn II. This interpretation was taken seriously by the eminent historian Frank Barlow, though the style of lettering of the inscription may be of too late a date, perhaps c. 1200. It has also been postulated by historian , that a man identified by the chronicler Gallus Anonymus as Magnus, Count of Wroc≈Çaw, a royal who arrived in the 1070s from a land that had just fallen under the yoke of foreign rule, was in fact Magnus Haroldson, the son of the Anglo-Saxon King Harold II. Following the defeat of Harold by the Norman William the Conqueror, Magnus' sister Gytha of Wessex and at least two of her brothers (believed by some to be Godwin and Edmund) escaped to the court of their first cousin once-removed, King Sweyn II of Denmark. Gytha later married Vladimir II Monomakh, who would later become Grand Duke of Kievan Rus. The flag of the Duchy of Masovia, which included the Anglo-Saxon wyvern Polish historian and genealogist Marek Skarbek-Kozietulski, working off the premise laid out by Jurek, theorized that Haroldson, following his stay in Denmark trekked to Poland and entered into a strategic marriage to a woman he believed to be an unrecorded sister of King Boles≈Çaw II the Generous. Skarbek-Kozietulski had also discussed an idea first put forward by Krzysztof Benyskiewicz that Boles≈Çaw II's wife (whose ancestry has never been accurately confirmed) was in fact an illegitimate daughter of Sweyn II of Denmark and that it was arranged for Haroldson to marry one of her sisters, thereby making him brother-in-law to Boles≈Çaw and providing an explanation of Magnus' newfound title and status. Regardless of to whom Magnus eventually married, Skarbek-Kozietulsk believed that these theories, along with the sudden appearance of the Anglo-Saxon wyvern in the flag and coat of arms of the later Duchy of Masovia, which was previously unknown in Polish heraldry, and the Y-DNA haoplogroup I1 subclades I1-ASP and I1-T2 (both of which are originally found in England and Denmark) being found within various Polish noble families, give weight to the theory that Magnus Haroldson was in fact Magnus, Count of Wroc≈Çaw. A township near to the castle of Czersk where his supposed remains were exhumed in 1966 is called Magnuszew. Twentieth century historians also believed that Magnus, Count of Wroc≈Çaw was the grandfather of Piotr W≈Çostowic, voivode of Duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth (nephew of Boles≈Çaw II) and progenitor of the Duninowie clan.

He was captured during the course of the Norman conquest of England, and imprisoned in Normandy, being released only at the death of William the Conqueror.  Birth and parentage  Ulf's family was one of the most powerful in Anglo-Saxon England: his paternal grandfather was Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his father was Harold Godwinson, who inherited the same title and was crowned king of England at the beginning of 1066. Harold's first wife, whom he married in a form of ceremony not recognized by the church, was called Edith Swan-neck, and his second wife was Ealdgyth, sister of the earls Edwin and Morcar. Most historians believe Edith Swan-neck was Ulf's mother, but in the 19th century Edward Freeman argued that it was Ealdgyth. Frank Barlow was undecided. Ulf's date of birth is also uncertain. If Freeman was correct then Ealdgyth must have given birth to Ulf in Chester after Harold's death, having been married to him for only a few months in total, and since she was also the mother of a son called Harold that would necessarily imply that the two boys were twins. On the other hand Ian Walker argues that he was born between 1047 and 1053. Ulf's name, a Scandinavian one, was perhaps taken from a maternal uncle of Harold Godwinson.  Imprisonment  At some point in William the Conqueror's reign, perhaps during the period of confusion after the Battle of Hastings, Ulf was taken prisoner and moved to Normandy, where he remained until 1087. When William was on his deathbed he was persuaded by the church dignitaries in attendance on him to release all of his political prisoners, Ulf among them. Apparently the terms of Ulf's imprisonment had been loose enough to allow him to learn the skills of a mounted warrior, since William's successor as Duke of Normandy, Robert Curthose, knighted Ulf. He also allowed Ulf to leave Normandy, but it is not known whether he did so since there is no further record of Ulf's career.

He was driven into exile by the Norman conquest of England, and found refuge at the court of the king of Norway.  Birth and parentage  Harold's family was one of the most powerful in Anglo-Saxon England: his paternal grandfather was Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his father was Harold Godwinson, who inherited the same title and was crowned king of England at the beginning of 1066.

Historians almost unanimously believe Ealdgyth was Harold's mother, though Ealdgyth's biographer in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography only concedes that this is \\"not impossible\\". Harold was probably born posthumously in Chester, where his mother had fled to escape the advancing army of William the Conqueror. It has been argued that he was a twin of Ulf Haroldson, but this is considered doubtful.  Exile  In the winter of 1069‚Äì1070 Chester was occupied by the Normans, but presumably Ealdgyth and her young son had fled by that time, and her most obvious refuge would be the Norse-Irish city of Dublin, which had previously sheltered other members of Harold's family. At some point Harold sailed to Norway and was welcomed by the king, whose family remembered with gratitude Harold Godwinson's generosity in allowing Olaf, son of Harald Hardrada, to return home after the disastrous battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1098 he was one of the men Magnus III Barelegs took with him on an expedition to Orkney, the Hebrides, the Isle of Man and Anglesey. No further mention of Harold appears in any source.

Founded in Die√üen in the 1930s by Otto Wilhelm Sch√∂nstein (1891‚Äì1958), Raumbild produced 6x13cm photographic stereo pairs designed to be used with the proprietary fold-out \\"Photoplastikon\\" viewer produced for the company, some of which featured Zeiss Jena lenses. Quickly aligning itself with the propaganda arm of the NSDAP, Raumbild moved around several times before settling in Munich in 1939.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/fotografen/schoenstein.html After the defeat of Germany in the Second World War, Raumbild changed directions in terms of content, while still focusing on subjects relevant to German identity. In 1996, the German Historical Museum obtained the remaining archives of Raumbild, which are now available to researchers.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/vorwort.html  Founder  Otto Wilhelm Sch√∂nstein was born in N√ºrnberg in 1891, and in his early life became a textile merchant.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/fotografen/schoenstein.html He was fascinated by stereoscopic photography, and in his early 40s he decided to transition from hobbyist into professional purveyor of stereoscopic images. After the Second World War, Sch√∂nstein was tried and released for his complicity in Nazi propaganda; he lived in relative obscurity, publishing new 6x13cm stereoview sets under pseudonyms until his death in 1958.https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2013/08/30/1008/  Establishment, early efforts, and association with Nazism  Sch√∂nstein incorporated Raumbild on 14 January 1935.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte.html Although his first publishing efforts were failures due to negative reviews from Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums, his later work with Raumbild throughout the mid-1930s and through the mid 1940s was very popular in Germany. The country was swept up in nationalistic fervor; Sch√∂nstein would capitalize on this in his works after changing his focus from travel photography to Germanic subjects. He quickly came to the attention of the Nazi Party, and his company became a de facto photographic arm of the Propaganda Ministry of the Party. This association led to unprecedented access for Sch√∂nstein and his employees and collaborators, beginning with the 1936 Summer Olympics in which he collaborated with Leni Riefenstahl. The resulting book & stereograph collection, Die Olympischen Spiele, was a commercial success, at which point Heinrich Hoffmann, Adolf Hitler's personal photographer, became a silent partner with a 50% stake in Raumbild for a 5,000 RM initial investment and a 10,000 RM loan.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte1.html Hoffmann became the official photographer, while Sch√∂nstein ‚Äì regarded as an inferior lensman ‚Äì curated and produced the various sets released by the company. This partnership cemented a longstanding relationship between Raumbild and the Third Reich which lasted until the end of the Second World War, although production of new materials ceased in 1942 as the war efforts made continuing photography difficult.  Postwar activities  After the war, Raumbild stopped producing materials related to the NSDAP. During denazification, which continued until 1953, Sch√∂nstein continued to create photographs and photographic sets; after a 6-month probationary period in 1946 related to his collusion with the Third Reich, Raumbild resumed production.http://www.stereoskopie.com/Raumbildbaende/Otto_Schonstein/body_otto_schonstein.html Sch√∂nstein produced sets with the intention of selling to American occupying forces; this provided the bulk of his income for the remainder of his life.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte5.html In 1951, most of Sch√∂nstein's assets were seized as a judgement against his actions during the War; nevertheless, he would produce one of his final major works through Raumbild, covering the 1952 Olympics. During this period, Raumbild was primarily publishing the works of other photographers, primarily in color, and the subject matter ranged from landscapes to architecture to nudes. In early 1958, Raumbild was declared defunct, and Sch√∂nstein would have to sell; the company passed to Siegfried Brandm√ºller, a former employee of Sch√∂nstein's who would run the company for the next 27 years. The 23-year-old Brandm√ºller kept Sch√∂nstein on as an employee, which greatly embarrassed the former Raumbild giant; he would die just six months later. After a few initial successes by Brandm√ºller, Raumbild went dormant for a long time, although a number of attempts were made to re-launch the company; all of these failed.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte6.html Raumbild folded for good in the mid-1980s. The Raumbild archives (outside of those seized by the American government and now in the public domain) changed hands a number of times and are now owned by the German Historical Museum.  Publications  It is difficult to produce a definitive list of Raumbild's output, as some works were produced in extremely small editions, and numerous smaller manufacturers attached the Raumbild name to unauthorized sets not actually affiliated with the company.

With the main theme on the struggles or experiences faced by the resident Korean community or individuals in Japan, the Zainichi cinema is characterized by a wide range of film genres, which encompass melodramas to Yakuza films.  Background  = Earlier Zainichi- themed films = The earliest Japanese films featuring Koreans or resident Koreans in Japan can be traced back to the propaganda films of the early 1920s, when Korea was still under the Japanese colonial rule. During this period, Koreans in Japan were often depicted as members of the peripheral society rather than the main characters. Moreover, the film of this era exclusively tied this particular population to the two-way images of poverty and cheap laborers. For example, in films such as Look at This Mom (1930) and The Brick Factory Girl (1940), Korean laborers in Japan were primarily depicted as impoverished residents of the marginal slums where they closely lived with other poor people. Additionally, in a film titled Mr. Thank You (1936) directed by Shimizu Hiroshi, a scene, where nomadic Korean construction workers and their family move from one place to another in Japan, was inserted while highlighting the exploitive treatment of laborers from Korea. In the postwar era, several films played an instrumental role in publicly visualizing the struggles and oppression experienced by Zainichi Koreans. In doing so, however, the Zainichi-themed films often replicated the stereotypes of Zainichi Koreans as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal.‚Äù Prominently, Death by Hanging (1968) directed by Oshima Nagisa drew the struggles of a young Zainichi Korean prisoner. The main character named ‚ÄúR‚Äù allegedly murdered two Japanese women after raping them. Following his arrest, the trial decided that R be executed by hanging. In the film, his violence was portrayed as an explosive manifestation of his complicated identity crisis, while his delinquent past and domestic violence within his family exclusively colored the personal character of R. Other films of this era included By a Man's Face You Shall Know (1966) by Kato Tai, Three Resurrected Drunkards (1968) by Oshima Nagisa, and Empire of Kids (1981) by Izutsu Kazuyuki. These postwar films of the 20th century were generally illustrative of the struggles and difficulties faced by many Zainichi Koreans. At the same time, Zainichi characters were repeatedly represented as Yakuza members or criminals, thereby sustaining their image as violent social outcasts. In 1975, a movie titled River of the Stranger was shot and released by director Lee Hak-in. Unlike the earlier films with the depiction of Zainichi characters, this film was the first Zainichi-themed film that was directed by a Zainichi Korean director. Subsequently, his work was followed by other Zainichi Korean film directors such as Sai Yoichi, Lee Sang- il, Yang Yong-hi, Oh Mipo, and Sugino Kiki, while Japanese directors continued to produce Zainichi-themed films. = Contemporary Zainichi films (1990s-Present) = In 1993, director Sai Yoichi released an award-winning movie titled All Under the Moon. The unveiling of this film was seen by many critics as the major transition in the existing representation of Zainichi Koreans in the film industry. Based on a novel called Taxi Crazy Rapsody, the story unfolds when a Zainichi taxi driver, Tadao, fell in love with a Filipino bartender. The melodramatic portrayal of Zainichi characters was unconventional in that it broke the recurring representation of Zainichi Koreans as Yakuza members or violent criminals. Since 2000, many Zainichi- themed films such as Go (2001), Blood and Bones (2004), Break Through! (2005) have been released. In comparison to the limited availability and representation in the earlier Zainichi-themed films, the recently released films have enabled more humanistic representation of Zainichi Koreans. Moreover, Zainichi-themed films such as Our School (2007) and Anarchist from Colony (2017) were directed by South Korean film directors, respectively Kim Myeong-joon and Lee Joon-ik. This transnational trend has brought some new insights into the contemporary Zainichi cinema while reflecting this rapidly changing film industry.

While Childers was sympathetic to many of the themes contained in the book, she felt that despite being marketed as a Christian book, its core message of lifting oneself up by their bootstraps as the solution to any problem came in lieu of \\"surrendering your life to Jesus and placing your trust in him alone.\\" She also acknowledged that the book \\"exhausted\\" her. \\"It's all about what I can be doing better and what I'm not doing good enough,\\" she observed. \\"How to be better at work, parenting, and writing.

A polygonal fort is a type of fortification originating in France in the late 18th century and fully developed in Germany in the first half of the 19th century. Unlike earlier forts, polygonal forts had no bastions, which had proved to be vulnerable. As part of ring fortresses, polygonal forts were generally arranged in a ring around the place they were intended to protect, so that each fort could support its neighbours. The concept of the polygonal fort proved to be adaptable to improvements in the artillery which might be used against them, and they continued to be built and rebuilt well into the 20th century. Bastion system deficiencies A diagram showing Vauban's method of approaching an enemy fortification using saps and parallels. The bastion system of fortification had dominated military thinking since its introduction in 16th century Italy, until the first decades of the 19th century. The French engineer S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, also devised an effective method to defeat them. Before Vauban, besiegers had driven a sap towards the fort, until they reached the glacis, where artillery could be positioned, directly to fire on the scarp wall, to make a breach. Vauban used saps to create three successive lines of entrenchments surrounding the fort, known as \\"parallels\\". The first two parallels reduced the vulnerability of the sapping work to a sally by the defenders, while the third parallel allowed the besiegers to launch their attack from any point along its circumference. The final refinement devised by Vauban was first used at the Siege of Ath in 1697, when he placed his artillery in the third parallel, at a point close to the bastions, from where they could ricochet their shot along the inside of the parapet, dismounting the enemy guns and killing the defenders.Hogg, pp. 51‚Äì52 Other European engineers quickly adopted the three- parallel Vauban system, which became the standard method and would prove to be almost infallible.Ostwald, p. 12 Vauban designed three systems of fortification, each having a more elaborate system of outworks, which were intended to prevent the besiegers from enfilading the bastions. During the next century, other engineers tried and failed to perfect the bastion system to nullify the Vauban type of attack.Duffy, p. 41 During the 18th century, it was found that the continuous enceinte, or main defensive enclosure of a bastion fortress, could not be made large enough to accommodate the enormous field armies which were increasingly being employed in Europe, neither could the defences be constructed far enough away from the fortress town to protect the inhabitants from bombardment by the besiegers, the range of whose guns was steadily increasing as better manufactured weapons were introduced.Royal Military Academy p. 143Hogg p. 73 Theories of Montalembert and Carnot Fort de Querqueville, one of the casemated coastal forts at Cherbourg, which was based on Montalembert's system. Marc Ren√©, marquis de Montalembert (1714‚Äì1800) envisaged a system to prevent an opponent from establishing their parallel entrenchments by an overwhelming artillery barrage from a large number of guns, which were to be protected from return fire. The elements of his system were the replacement of bastions with tenailles, resulting in a defensive line with a zigzag plan, allowing for the maximum number of guns to be brought to bear and the provision of gun towers or redoubts (small forts), forward of the main line, each mounting a powerful artillery battery. All the guns were to be mounted in multi-storey masonry casemates, vaulted chambers built into the ramparts of the forts. Defence of the ditches was to be by caponiers, covered galleries projecting into the ditch with numerous loopholes for small arms, compensating for the loss of the bastions with their flanking fire.Wade, p. 110 Montalembert argued that the three elements, would provide long-range offensive fire from the casemated main curtain, defence in depth from the detached forts or towers and close-in defence from the caponiers.Duffy p. 160 Montalembert described his theories in an eleven-volume work called La Fortification Perpendiculaire which was published in Paris between 1776 and 1778.Wade, p. 110 He summarised the benefits of his system thus; \\"...all is exposed to the fire of the besieged, which is everywhere superior to that of the besieger, and the latter cannot advance a step without being hit from all sides\\".Lloyd & Marsh, p. 114 Castle Williams in New York Harbor, constructed from 1807 according to Montalembert's system A full realisation of Montalembert's ambitious plans for a great inland fortress was never attempted. Almost immediately after publication, unofficial translations into German were being made of Montalembert's work and were being circulated amongst the officers of the Prussian Army. In 1780, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, a Hanoverian officer who went on to reform the Prussian Army, wrote that \\"All foreign experts in military and engineering affairs hail Montalembert's work as the most intelligent and distinguished achievement in fortification over the last hundred years. Things are very different in France\\". The conservative French military establishment was wedded to the principles laid down by Vauban and improvements made by his later followers, Louis de Cormontaigne and Charles Louis de Fourcroy. What little political influence the aristocratic Montalembert had during the Ancien R√©gime was lost following the French Revolution in 1792.Duffy p. 163 Despite the conservatism of the French engineer corps, two French engineers experimented on a modest scale with Montalembert's ideas for detached forts. Jean Le Michaud d'Ar√ßon, ironically one of Montalembert's detractors, designed and built a number of lunettes (an outwork resembling a detached bastion) which were in accord with Montalembert's concepts. These lunettes were constructed at Mont-Dauphin, Besan√ßon, Perpignan and other border fortresses, commencing in 1791 shortly before the Revolution. In the same year, Antoine √âtienne de Tousard took up a position on Malta as an engineer to the Order of Saint John and was instructed to design a small fort to command the entrance to Marsamxett Harbour called Fort Tign√©. Exactly how Tousard became acquainted with d'Arcon's lunette design is unknown, but the resemblance is too close to be coincidental. It was, like d'Arcon's works, quadrilateral in plan, divided by a traverse with a circular tower keep in the rear and the surrounding ditch was protected by counterscarp galleries. Fort Tign√©, however, was a fully defensible and self- contained fort, larger and more sophisticated than d'Arcon's outworks,Spiteri pp. 6-11 and is regarded as being the first true polygonal fort.Spiteri p. 71 Montalembert's work was also allowed to take concrete form during his lifetime in the field of coastal fortification. In 1778, he was commissioned to build a fort on the √éle-d'Aix, defending the port of Rochefort, Charente-Maritime. The outbreak of the Anglo-French War forced him hastily to build his casemated fort from wood but he was able to prove that his well-designed casemates were capable of operating without choking the gunners with smoke, one of the principal objections of his detractors.Lloyd & Marsh, pp. 125‚Äì127 The defences of the new naval base at Cherbourg were later constructed according to his system.Lepage p. 96 After seeing Montalembert's coastal forts, American engineer Jonathan Williams acquired a translation of his book and took it to the United States, where it inspired the Second and Third Systems of coastal fortification; the first fully developed example being Castle Williams in New York Harbor which was started in 1807.Wade p. 111Hogg p. 78 Lazare Carnot was an able French engineer officer, whose support for Montalembert had impeded his military career immediately after the Revolution. Taking up politics, he was made Minister of War in 1800 and retired from public life two years later. In 1809, Napoleon I asked him to write a handbook for the commanders of fortresses, which was published in the following year under the title De la d√©fense des places fortes.Royal Military Academy pp. 127‚Äì128 While broadly supporting Montalembert and rejecting the bastion system, Carnot proposed that an attacker's preparations should be disrupted by massed infantry sorties, supported by a hail of high-angle fire from mortars and howitzers. Some of Carnot's innovations, such as the Carnot wall, a loopholed wall at the foot of the scarp face of the rampart, to shelter defending infantry, were used in many later fortifications but remained controversial.Lepage pp. 147‚Äì148 Prussian System Early types of Prussian polygonal forts built at Cologne in 1817 and 1825. After the final fall of Napoleon I in 1815, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, an alliance of the numerous German states, dominated by the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire. Their priority was to establish a defensive system with the Fortresses of the German Confederation against France in the west and Russia in the east.Kaufmann & Kaufmann p. 7 The Prussians started in the west by refortifying the fortress cities of Koblenz and Cologne (), both important crossing points on the River Rhine, under the direction of Ernst Ludwig von Aster and assisted by Gustav von Rauch, both supporters of the Montalembert system.Kaufmann & Kaufmann p. 9 Clearly influenced by Montalembert and Carnot, the novel feature of these new works was that they were encircled by forts, each several hundred metres out from the original enciente, carefully sited so as to make best use of the terrain and to be capable of mutual support with the neighbouring forts. The new fortifications established the principle of the ring fortress or girdle fortress.Douglas, p. 126 The detached forts were polygons of four or five sides in plan, with the front faces of the rampart angled at 95¬∞. The rear or gorge of the fort was closed with a masonry wall, sufficient to repel a surprise infantry attack but easily demolished by the defenders' artillery should the fort be captured by the attackers. In the centre of the gorge wall was a reduit or keep, provided with casemates for guns which could fire over the rampart or along the flanks to support the next forts in the chain.Royal Military Academy pp. 132‚Äì133 The original bastioned encientes of these fortresses were initially retained or even rebuilt so as to prevent an attacker from infiltrating between the outlying forts and taking the fortress by a coup de main. It was later thought by some engineers that a simple entrenchment would suffice or that no inner defence was necessary; the issue remained a debating point for some decades.Kenyon, p. 3 In any case, few European cities undergoing the rapid expansion caused by the Industrial Revolution would willingly accept the restriction to their growth caused by a continuous line of ramparts.Lloyd, p. 98 Aster insisted that his new technique was \\"not to be regarded... as a particular system\\" but this type of ring fortress became known as the Prussian System. Austrian engineers adopted a similar approach although differing in some details; the Prussian System and the Austrian System were together known as the German System.Royal Military Academy p. 132 Lessons of the Crimean War The Crimean War (October 1853 to February 1856) was fought by the Russian Empire and an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Russian fortifications, which included some modern advances, were tested against the latest British and French artillery. At Sevastopol, the focus of the allied effort, the Russians had planned a modern fortress but little work had been done and earthworks were rapidly constructed instead. The largest and most complex earthwork, the Great Redan, was found to be largely resistant to British bombardments and difficult to carry by assault. Only one stone casemated work, the Malakoff Tower, had been completed at the time of the allied landing and proved impervious to bombardment but was finally carried by French infantry in a coup de main.Hogg pp. 79‚Äì81 In the Battle of Kinburn (1855), an Anglo-French fleet undertook a bombardment of the Russian fortress which guarded the mouth of the Dnieper River. The most successful weapon there was the Paixhans gun which was mounted on ironclad floating batteries. These guns were the first to be able to fire explosive shells on a low trajectory and were able to devastate the open ramparts of the forts, causing their surrender within four hours. British attempts to subdue the casemated Russian forts at Kronstadt and other fortifications in the Baltic Sea using conventional naval guns were far less successful.Hogg, pp. 80‚Äì82 Impact of rifled artillery Fort Nelson at Portsmouth, one of the Palmerston Forts built in the United Kingdom in the 1860s. The first rifled artillery designs were developed independently during the 1840s and 1850s by several engineers in Europe. These weapons offered greatly increased range, accuracy and penetrating power over smooth- bore guns then in use.Kinard, p. 222 The first effective use of rifled guns was during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, when the French used them against the Austrians. The Austrians quickly realised that the outlying forts of their ring fortresses were now too close to prevent an enemy from bombarding a besieged town and at Verona, they added a second circle of forts, about forward of the existing ring.Royal Military Academy, p. 150 The British were apprehensive about a French invasion and in 1859 appointed the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom to fortify the naval dockyards of southern England. The experts on the commission, led by Sir William Jervois, interviewed Sir William Armstrong, a major developer and manufacturer of rifled artillery and were able to incorporate his advice into their designs.Crick 2012, pp. 46‚Äì47 The ring forts at Plymouth and Portsmouth were set further out than the Prussian designs they were based on and the casemates of coastal batteries were protected by composite armoured shields, tested to be resistant to the latest heavy projectiles.Dyer 2003, p. 7 The gorge or interior of Fort d'Uxegney, showing the heavily protected accommodation casemates typical of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system. In the United States, it had been decided at an early stage that it would be impractical to providing landward fortifications for rapidly expanding cities but a considerable investment had been made in seaward defences in the form of multi-tiered casemated batteries, originally based on Montalembert's designs. During the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865, the exposed masonry of these coastal batteries was found to be vulnerable to modern rifled artillery; Fort Pulaski was quickly breached by only ten of these guns. On the other hand, the hastily constructed earthworks of landward fortifications proved much more resilient; the garrison of Fort Wagner were able to hold out for 58 days behind ramparts built of sand.Hogg, p. 101 In France the military establishment clung to the concept of the bastion system. Between 1841 and 1844, an immense bastioned trace, the Thiers Wall, was built around Paris. It was a single rampart long reinforced by 94 bastions. The main approaches to the city were further defended by several outlying bastioned forts, designed for all-round defence but not sited to be mutually supporting. In the Franco- Prussian War of 1870, the invading Prussians were able to surround Paris after taking some of the outer forts and then bombard the city and its population with their rifled siege guns, without the need for a costly assault.Hogg, p. 102 In the aftermath of defeat, the French belatedly adopted a version of the polygonal system in a huge programme of fortification which commenced in 1874, under the direction of General Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res. Polygonal forts typical of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system had guns protected by iron armour or revolving Mougin turrets. The vulnerable masonry of the accommodation casemates were built facing away from an opponent, protected overhead by large mounds of earth, deep.Hogg, p. 104 The programme involved the building of ring fortresses around Paris and to guard border crossings, often surrounding Vauban-era fortifications; the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to the Prussians created the need for a new defensive zone, described as a \\"barrier of iron\\".Kaufmann & Kaufmann (Neutral States), p. xiii Similar forts were also being built in Germany designed Hans Alexis von Bichler.Kaufmann & Kaufmann (Central States), p. 47 The \\"torpedo-shell crisis\\" A typical Belgian fort designed by Henri Alexis Brialmont in the 1880s, showing the broadly triangular plan which he favoured. From the mid-19th century, chemists produced the first high explosive compounds, as opposed to low explosives such as gunpowder. The first of these, nitroglycerine and from 1867, dynamite, proved to be too unstable to be fired from a gun without exploding in the barrel. In 1885, the French chemist Eug√®ne Turpin, patented a form of picric acid, which proved stable enough to be used as a blasting charge in artillery shells. These shells had recently evolved from the traditional sphere of iron into a pointed cylinder, at that time known as a \\"torpedo-shell\\". The combination of these, combined with new delayed-action fuzes, meant that shells could bury themselves deep under the surface of a fort and then explode with unprecedented force. The realisation that this new technology made even the most modern forts vulnerable was known as the \\"torpedo-shell crisis\\". The great powers of continental Europe were forced into vastly expensive programmes of fortification building and rebuilding to designs that were calculated to counter this latest threat.Donnel, pp. 7‚Äì8 In France, the recently completed forts began to be refurbished, with thick layers of concrete reinforcing the ramparts and the roofs of magazines and accommodation spaces. The Belgians had not started their new fortifications when the effectiveness of the new munitions became known and their chief engineer, Henri Alexis Brialmont, was able to incorporate countermeasures in his design.Donnel, p. 8 Brialmont forts were triangular in plan and made extensive use of concrete with the main armament mounted in rotating turrets connected by tunnels.Donnel, p. 12 The French and Belgians assumed that the new forts must be able to withstand siege guns up to a calibre of as this was the largest mobile weapon in use.Hogg, pp. 103‚Äì105 In Germany, after updating their Bichler forts with layers of sand and concrete and building others in the style of Brialmont, a new design emerged, in which fort artillery and infantry positions would be dispersed in the landscape, connected only by trenches or tunnels and without a continuous enciente. This type of fortified position was called a and was the result of the work of several German theorists but came to fruition under Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz who was appointed Inspector-General of Fortifications in 1898.Kaufmann and Kaufmann (Central States), pp. 30‚Äì31 World Wars An aerial photograph of Fort Douaumont at the close of the Battle of Verdun in December 1916, following months of bombardment from both sides. At the start of the First World War in August 1914, the German Army crossed into neutral Belgium with the object of outflanking the French border fortifications. In their path was the fortified position of Li√®ge, a ring fortress built by Brialmont with a circumference of which the Germans reached on 4 August. Repeated attempts to pass massed infantry through the intervals between the forts resulted in the capture of the city of Li√®ge on 7 August, at the cost of 47,500 German casualties but without any of the forts being taken. Kaufmann & Kaufmann (Neutral States), pp. 94 The forts were only subdued by the arrival of super-heavy 42 cm Gamma M√∂rser siege howitzers and other large weapons, which were capable of smashing the armoured turrets and penetrating the concrete living spaces; the last fort surrendering on 16 August.Hogg, pp. 118‚Äì119 The fortified position of Namur was demolished in the same fashion a few days later and that at Antwerp only survived for longer because fewer resources were directed against it. Kaufmann & Kaufmann (Neutral States), p. 94 On the Eastern Front, the forts of Russia and Romania were also quickly overcome by German and Austrian heavy artillery. The French high command concluded that fixed fortifications were obsolete and they began the process of disarming their forts, since there was a grave shortage of medium artillery pieces in their field armies.Hogg, p. 121 In February 1916, the Germans began the Battle of Verdun, hoping to force the French to squander their forces in costly counter-attacks in an effort to regain it. They found that the Verdun forts, which had been recently upgraded with extra layers of concrete and sand, were resistant to their heaviest shells. Fort Douaumont was captured, almost by accident, by a small party of Germans who climbed through an unattended embrasure, the rest of the forts could not permanently be subdued and the offensive was eventually called off in July after huge casualties on both sides.Hogg, pp. 121‚Äì122 After the war, the apparent success of the Verdun forts led the French government to re- fortify the eastern border. Rather than build new polygonal forts, the method chosen was a developed version of the German system of dispersed strongpoints connected by tunnels to a central underground barracks, all concealed in the landscape. This concept known to the French as because the elements of the fort were analogous to the fingers of a hand.Kaufmann & Kaufmann (Fortress France), p. 14 The system became known as the Maginot Line, after the French Minister of War, who had initiated the project in 1930. Where the Maginot Line coincided with S√©r√© de Rivi√®res forts, new concrete casemates were constructed inside the old works.Kaufmann, Kaufmann & Lang, p. 208 In Belgium, a series of commissions decided that a new line of fortifications should be constructed at Li√®ge, while some of the old forts there should be modernised. Three new forts were constructed which were developed forms of the old Brialmont polygonal forts. The fourth and largest, Fort Eben-Emael, had its enciente defined by the great cutting of the Albert Canal.Dunstan (Introduction) On 10 May 1940, German forces attacked the new Belgian forts, quickly neutralising Eben-Emael by airborne assault. The three other forts were bombarded by 305 mm howitzers and dive-bombers and each repulsed several infantry assaults. Two of the forts surrendered on 21 May and the last, Fort de Battice, on the day after, having been by-passed by the main German thrust.Kauffmann (Fortress Europe), pp. 116‚Äì117 Modernised French polygonal forts at Maubeuge were attacked on 19 May and were surrendered after their gun turrets and observation domes had been knocked out with anti-tank guns and demolition charges. Late in the war, the ring fortifications of Metz were hastily prepared for defence by German forces and was attacked by the Third Army in mid-September 1944 in the Battle of Metz; the last fort surrendered nearly three months later.Zaloga, p. 70 References =Sources=       Fortifications by type Warfare of the Industrial era Fortification (architectural elements) ","title":"Polygonal fort"},{"id":"58453344","text":"Experimental Marriage is a 1919 American silent romantic comedy film directed by Robert G.

Biography  = Early life = Susie Sumner Revels was born in Mississippi in 1870, the same year her father, Hiram Revels, became the first black senator in US history. Revels' middle name \\"Sumner\\" was a tribute to the year Charles Sumner was sworn in as the Massachusetts senator when Revels was born. Revels' father escorted C. Sumner at his swearing-in ceremony. Revels graduated with honors from Rust College, teaching for three years, before returning to school to pursue a degree in nursing. = Career as a writer, journalist, and editor = Revels met her future husband, Horace Cayton, in Mississippi and after a period of long distance letter writing, later followed him to Seattle in 1896, where they were married in July of the same year. She began writing for his Seattle-based newspaper, The Seattle Republican, before departing Mississippi. She eventually became associate editor in 1900 and continued working at the paper until it folded in 1913. Revels and her husband started the newspaper Cayton's Weekly in 1916, targeted at a black readership. They promoted the great accomplishments and contributions of blacks as well as the atrocities committed against black members of the community. This paper ran until 1920 when it was replaced by Cayton's Monthly which only ran for two issues. In addition to her journalistic writing, Revels wrote short stories which appeared in The Seattle Republican, Cayton's Weekly, and the Seattle Post- Intelligencer. = Economic downturn = In 1919, at the age of 49, Susie Revels Cayton was forced to seek employment as a \\"domestic\\" as the family experienced economic hardships. Revels' interest in teaching was short-lived, but she later got involved in church and club related work in her community in Seattle. = Late life = In her sixties, Revels became politically active and joined the Communist Party, after being introduced to the organization by her son, and was considered \\"one of the state's most prominent African American radicals\\". She joined the communist party in reaction to depression- era Seattle, believing that only radical political change could address economic inequality. She became friends with activists Paul Robeson and Langston Hughes, and was admired by Richard Wright. Langston Hughes dedicated a poem, Dear Mr. President, to her. Revels moved to Chicago in 1942, two years after her husband died, to be closer to her children. She continued advocating for progressive politics and communism to promote equality until she died in 1943.  Charitable Work  Revels was a founding member and leader of a charity group called the Dorcas Club. Secretary, Skid Row Unemployed Council. Vice President, Negro Workers Council.  Children  Susie Revels Cayton had four children with Horace Cayton Sr.: two sons, activists Horace Cayton, Jr. and Revels Cayton; their oldest daughter, Madge, who was one of the first African American women to graduate from the University of Washington; and daughter Lillie. Madge was a career social worker in her lifetime. They also adopted their granddaughter, Susan, and raised her as their youngest child.  Legacy  In 1992 the Cayton Scholarship was established to honor the contributions of these great Seattle journalists. This scholarship is available to minority college students in Washington state.

He was the third child born to Charles Maverick Parker (1797‚Äì1872) and Cornelia (n√©e Vanderburgh) Parker (1807‚Äì1886), who married in Troy, New York in 1826. Of the four children, he was the only to live to maturity.

Career Parker received his education in France and at Heidelberg University in Heidelberg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, which is Germany's oldest university. After his return from Germany, he became a member of many clubs and was reportedly an \\"expert amateur billiard player, whist player, pigeon shot and whip, and when the Coaching Club was organized by Col.

In 1892, Parker was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Parker was noted as a \\"wit and a linguist\\" with a striking personal appearance due to his tall, military bearing and white hair. \\"He spoke French like a native and had the manners of a king.\\" He owned a cottage in Newport, Rhode Island, known as \\"Sans Souci\\" and located on Merton Road where he was generally one of the first summer residents to open his cottage and one of the last to leave. In 1897, he publicly challenged the Newport Assessors to \\"come into court and show before a Judge that their valuation is fair and reasonable\\" as he felt the tax assessment was overvalued. In Newport, he was a member of the Newport Reading Room, where he socialized with August Belmont, C.C. Baldwin, and General Prescott Lawrence (who donated the land to build the Groton School). At the time of his death, he was considered one of Newport's oldest summer residents. Parker died at his home, 253 Madison Avenue in New York City, on January 11, 1917 at the age of 86, leaving an estate worth $2,000,000.

The Thessalian Dodona is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in the Homer's Iliad along with Cyphus, Gonnos, and the \\"banks of the Titaresius\\", all ruled by Guneus, and belonging to the Enienes and Peraebi. These places and ethnic groups are all located in ancient Thessaly, not Epirus; and thus, there can be no doubt, that this passage in Homer refers to the Dodona in Thessaly. However, the other Dodona, and its oracle which Odysseus consulted, is mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey. There is another mention by Homer in the Iliad of Dodona, with a difference of opinion concerning which Dodona is meant; some supposing that Achilles prayed to Zeus in the Thessalian Dodona as the patron god of his native country; but others maintaining that the mention of Selli, whose name elsewhere occurs in connection with the Thesprotian Dodona, points to the place in Epirus. As there is no evidence of the existence of an oracle at the Thessalian Dodona, it is probable that the prayer of Achilles was directed to the god in Epirus, whose oracle had already acquired great celebrity, as we see from the passage in the Odyssey. The Thessalian Dodona is said to have been also called Bodona (ŒíœâŒ¥œéŒΩŒ∑); and from this place the Thesprotian Dodona is said to have received a colony and its name.

It is part of the Vo≈ædovac municipality and is a sub-neighborhood of the neighborhood of Vo≈ædovac itself. Built in 1930, it was one the earliest planned neighborhoods of Belgrade.  Location  The neighborhood occupies the northwestern section of Vo≈ædovac municipality. It is delineated by the elementary school \\"Karaƒëorƒëe\\" to the north, Vo≈ædovac Church to the south and by two major city streets, Vojvode Stepe to the east and the Liberation Boulevard to the west. ƒåinovniƒçka Kolonija borders the neighborhood of Autokomanda in the north, Du≈°anovac in the northeast, Vo≈ædovac in the east, Byford's Forest in the southeast and Dedinje, Diplomatska Kolonija and Stadion in the east.  History  = Origin = After the liberation in World War I in 1918, Vo≈ædovac was placed under the Belgrade's administrative rule. Despite economic hardships caused by the war, the growth of population in Belgrade experienced a boom. As much of the city was devastated, this resulted in very high rents. In order to alleviate this problem for their profession, both state and privately employed clerks formed the Clerks Housing Cooperative. In 1928, the cooperative purchased from the Belgrade municipality a vast lot of completely non-urbanized section of the Queen Maria's Suburb. Named after the dowager queen Maria of Yugoslavia, the inhabitants colloquially began to use name Vo≈ædovac which spread and was adopted as the official name. The large lot was located along the left side of Avala road, which was in this section called the ≈†umadija road and today is called the Boulevard of Liberation. It occupied the area between the Vo≈ædovac Church and the football stadium of SK Jugoslavija. = Design and construction = The Cooperative founders originally envisioned the settlement which would consist of several blocks of modern buildings, surrounded by the parks. This was quite popular at the time in the large European cities. The buildings was planned as the neatly packed, monumental edifices in the centers of large parks, with addition of \\"all technical facilities which will contribute to the coziness of dwelling\\". However, the members had different opinion so in the end it was decided to build small, individual residential houses. The land was divided in 299 smaller lots on which the settlement was built and the parceling plan was drafted in 1929. The area of the lots was from The parceling plan was work of ƒêorƒëe Kovaljevski. It envisioned the formation of 10 residential blocks with houses and 2 smaller block for public usage. One was planned for the open green market and the other for the building of the Cooperative, park and children playground. The building of the Cooperative was projected as the center of the settlement's public life, including the ballroom, cinema and a library. A square was also planned at the entry into the neighborhood, but neither the building nor the square have been built in the end. The settlement in general was designed by the Czech √©migr√© architect Jan Dubovy as a neighborhood of the residential family houses and villas with yards and green belts in between. Dubovy, in turn, based it on the garden city ideas of Ebenezer Howard. Other architects who contributed to the planning were Milan Zlokoviƒá, who worked on the typified houses, and Branislav Kojiƒá. But, out of almost 300 houses, over 200 were projected by the Russian architect Valery Stashevsky and his bureau. Each proprietor was free to choose an architect, but some of the basic guidelines set by Dubovy had to be followed: hipped roofs (folded into the pagoda style), green exterior shutters (either wooden or metallic), windows with ventilation dividers (≈°prosna), access staircase (bordered by the low bricked wall) to the entry doors, etc. As Dubovy was a staunch Modernist, general request was also not to place figures, pilasters, ornamental garlands and other classical decorative elements. The base of the houses were set at . Construction began in September 1930. Though the houses were considered villas, because of the economic crisis and the social and financial abilities of the investors, the projected houses are very simple and humble in architectural sense, but functional. For the most part they have no ornaments, but have protruded eaves and hipped roofs, mimicking the folk type of construction, especially of the ground-floor houses. Because of the \\"green city\\" ideas in the project, the houses are a bit away from the streets and from each other, so that they can be surrounded by the green areas and forested yards. Initially, only one house was granted a permit to be higher than the others. The house was owned by Milorad ≈†o≈°kiƒá, a chief inspector in the Ministry of Education. Special permit was granted by the city administration, after Dubovy allowed it. He did so because the house was located almost in the geometrical center of the neighborhood and due to lighthouse appearance of its tower. It was projected by the Russian √©migr√© architect Boris Fesenkov. = Later developments = In the 1980s began the upgrading of the villas, with annexes and upper floors being added. In July 1991 the neighborhood was placed under the preliminary protection, because some of the most important architects were behind the concept of ƒåinovniƒçka Kolonija and \\"because the establishment of the settlement was planned with unique urban concept\\". By this time, only 83 houses remained intact appearance since the 1930s. However, this status was revoked in 1994. Because of the economic meltdown which followed the collapse of Yugoslavia and the ensuing wars, many of the old owners sold their houses. The investors began constructing new buildings, in different styles, which though formally have only one floor, are towering the old houses as the investors are not abiding either to the law or the projects and build whatever they want. Also, in order to obtain the largest possible floor area, the entire lots are urbanized so the gardens and yards are being destroyed. This way, the modern settlement is completely opposite to what was originally envisioned in the 1930s. By 2007 less than 50 original houses remained.  Administration  The original name of the settlement was ƒåinovniƒçko naselje \\"Vo≈ædovac\\" (Clerks settlement \\"Vo≈ædovac\\") but was later renamed to ƒåinovniƒçka Kolonija. ƒåinovniƒçka Kolonija is organized as a local community, a sub-municipal administrative unit within Vo≈ædovac. The local community was officially named \\"Dr Nenad Parenta\\" in the censuses of 1981 and 1991, and then it was named after the neighborhood. According to the last census of 2011, it had a population of 3,867.  Characteristics  The settlement remains predominantly residential. The eastern section, along the right side of the Vojvode Stepe Street is occupied by the taller buildings from a later period. In some of the newly upgraded buildings there are small clinics and hotels. The Twelfth Belgrade Gymnasium is located in the neighborhood. The endowment of physicist ƒêorƒëe ≈Ωivanoviƒá is in situated in his house in ƒåinovniƒçka Kolonija.

Called the \\"Flower Wizard of California\\", and \\"The Pioneer Seed-grower\\", Theodosia was the first woman in California and possibly in the United States to hybridize flowers. The Theodosia B. Shepherd Company, her seed and bulb business, is considered to be the foundation of California's seed industry. She was compared favorably to Luther Burbank. The location of her former garden is listed as number 34 in the City of Ventura Historic Landmarks and Districts. Early life Theodosia Burr Hall was born in Keosauqua, a settlement in the Iowa Territory, on October 14, 1845. Her parents were Augustus Hall and Ellen P. (Lee) Hall. In 1846, Iowa was admitted to the Union and became a state. In 1854 Theodosia's father was elected as the Democratic candidate to Congress in the First District. In 1857 he became a Chief Justice of the Nebraska Territory. Theodosia grew up in Iowa, where she went to school. From 1857 to 1859 she boarded at a finishing school in Batavia, New York run by Mrs. William G. Bryan (Ruth Beardsley Bryan). Theodosia Burr Hall married lawyer William Edgar Shepherd of Oskaloosa, Iowa, in Bellevue, Nebraska, on either September 4, 1866, September 9, 1866 or September 4, 1867. They had four children: Augustus H., Myrtle Ellen (later Lloyd, later Francis), Margaret (later Oaks), and Edith (later Mrs. Fred Kelsey.) Theodosia suffered from tuberculosis, or \\"lung trouble\\". In 1873, the family moved to California in search of a more healthful climate. They settled in \\"Ventura-by-the-Sea\\", where William Edgar Shepherd became the editor of the Ventura Signal. Horticulture Cover, Theodosia B Shepherd Company Catalogue, 1900 Mrs. Shepherd's Rose 'Oriole' thumbMrs. Shepherd's 'Marvelous' Double Petunias Described as having \\"a wizard's touch in the treatment of plants and flowers\\", Theodosia was the first woman in California to hybridize flowers and sell their seeds. At the time of her death, she was credited with being \\"the most noted woman in this line of work... not only in California but over all the country.\\" In 1905, one writer enthused that she was \\"known to every floriculturist in civilization as a hybridizer of blossoms and originator of new flowers\\". She collected seeds, plants, and rare flowers, and developed new varieties, including begonias, Coreopsis section Calliopsis, cosmos, nasturtiums, petunias, poppies, and a rose, 'Oriole'. She developed the ever-popular 'Heavenly Blue' morning glory, and the 'Golden West' California Poppy. She developed the first of the 'Superbissima' genotype of petunia, a variety called 'California Giant' which became the most frequently grown petunia of the 1930s. The work of developing a new flower began with the identification of potentially interesting \\"sports\\" of a flower, each of which was carefully raised. Then, \\"When the flower goes to seed, she gathers the seeds, sows them, watches and tends the resulting plants till they fructify and in like manner gathers the seeds of this second generation and garners them for planting.\\" In addition,\\"hybridizing is an intensely interesting part of Mrs. Shepherd's work. She carefully selects the flowers she wishes to cross, then takes upon the tip of a little camel hair brush some of the pollen of one flower and deposits it upon the pistil of the other flower.\\" Such work involved \\"accurate, painstaking, patient and continuous labor\\". Shepherd was encouraged to consider hybridizing as a business by nurseryman Peter Henderson of New York, around 1881. By 1884, she had formed the Theodosia B. Shepherd Company in Ventura, California. By 1892, she was cultivating 8 acres of gardens, which included a hedge of heliotrope long, and selling seeds nationally and internationally. The business published an annual retail catalogue as well as two lists for wholesalers. The company was incorporated in 1902. The seed and bulb business that Theodosia established is considered to be the foundation of California‚Äôs seed industry. In addition to growing and hybrizing flowers and running a company, Theodosia wrote and lectured about plants and flowers. She encouraged other women to make horticulture a profession by growing flowers and selling seeds. She was seen as an exemplar for women in the profession. She was favorably compared to Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, a hybridizer of vegetables and fruits. She was sometimes called \\"The Female Burbank\\" or \\"The Pioneer Seed-grower\\". Her gardens were considered \\"to have put Ventura on the map\\". Visitors to her gardens included Susan B. Anthony, Julia Ward Howe, and Washington Atlee Burpee of Burpee Seeds. Later life Theodosia Burr Shepherd died on September 6, 1906 in Ventura, California. She was cremated and interred in the Rosedale cemetery in Los Angeles. On December 7, 1907, William Edgar Shepherd married Theodosia's widowed sister Ella Hall Enderlein. Theodosia's daughter Mrs. Myrtle Shepherd Francis inherited her business. Like her mother, she specialized in breeding flowers, including self-seeding double petunias. Her second husband, Willard H. Francis, acted as manager. In 1946, Myrtle Shepherd Francis wrote a biography of her mother, entitled Theodosia: The Flower Wizard of California. Manuscript copies were left in the archives of UCLA and UC Berkeley. An edited edition of the book was finally published on May 10, 2014. Remnants of Theodosia's garden still remain in Ventura. She planted a banana plant and two strawberry trees which are now in the grounds of the E. P. Foster Library. The corner of Chestnut and Poli Streets, near where she lived, was designated a local historic landmark as of July 17, 1978. At that time, the only plants remaining from her garden were a Star Pine and a Bird of Paradise. There have been attempts to reclaim some of the areas that were once part of Shepherd's garden as community gardens. Materials relating to Theodosia Burr Shepherd are located in the archives of the Charles E. Young Research Library at UCLA and the Bancroft library at UC Berkeley.

Originally a German vessel called Else, she was captured by the Royal Navy in the first days of the First World War. In April 1917 she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as a Q ship with the name HMS First Prize, later to be shortened to HMS Prize. During her first patrol, Prize was involved in an engagement with a U-boat, for which Sanders received the Victoria Cross while the rest of the crew were also awarded various medals. Prize was destroyed by a torpedo on 13 August 1917, with all crew lost. History A steel-hulled three-masted schooner, Else was built in Groningen, Holland, by the firm E. V. Smit & Zoon in 1901 for a German ship owner. Displacing 277 tons, she had an overall length of with a beam of . Her draught was . Her home port was Leer, near Emden. On 4 August 1914, the day on which the United Kingdom declared war on Imperial Germany and entered the First World War, she was transiting the English Channel carrying a cargo of hides. Intercepted by , a small cruiser of the Royal Navy, Elses crew was taken prisoner and the ship sailed into Falmouth with a prize crew. Else was sold a month later; her new owner was the Marine and Navigation Company, owned by William Garthwaite. She was renamed First Prize, on account of being the first ship captured by the Royal Navy during the war. Garthwaite's intention was to use her on the coastal trading routes. Later on in the war, the Admiralty was looking for vessels suitable for fitting out as Q ships. These were merchant ships crewed by Royal Navy personnel and bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, a portion of the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q ship's guns would become operational and open fire, hopefully destroying the submarine. In November 1916, First Prize, berthed at Swansea, was identified as being a vessel suitable for Q ship service. She was accordingly requisitioned by the Royal Navy. Within weeks, Garthwaite had gifted the ship to the Royal Navy for service in the war. He also offered to fit her out for war service in return for an honorary commission in the Royal Navy, but this was declined. Service as a Q ship The commander of Prize, William Sanders First Prize underwent a refit at Ponsharden, near Falmouth. This included the fitting of two 12-pounder guns, at the bow and stern respectively. The gun at the bow was screened within a collapsible deckhouse while that at the stern was mounted such that it could be raised from the hold. Two Lewis guns and a machinegun were also fitted. The vessel's mode of propulsion was added to, with twin diesel motors, manufactured by Kelvin Diesels, being fitted and for communications, a radio transmitter and receiver, not typical for sailing vessels of the time, was installed. First Prize was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy on 25 April 1917, with a crew of 27, including its commander, Lieutenant William Sanders, a New Zealander serving in the Royal Naval Reserve. She departed for her first patrol the next day. In the evening of 30 April, near the Scillies in the Atlantic, First Prize was attacked by a U-boat, commanded by Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. The Q ship was badly damaged by shellfire from the U-boat's deck guns. Sanders, having dispatched a panic party in a small boat thus giving the impression of a ship being abandoned, remained under cover with his men. Despite several of them being wounded, the crew remained hidden. After 20 minutes of shelling, First Prize appeared to be sinking. The U-boat approached her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and First Prize opened fire. Within a few minutes the submarine had received severe damage to her conning tower, with several crew members blown into the water. After moving away, the U-boat disappeared from sight in mist, and was believed by the crew of First Prize to have been sunk. The panic party, still in its boat, collected three survivors, including her captain, and brought them back to First Prize. The damage to the ship was serious, and the German prisoners assisted in repairs as it made for the Irish coast and received a tow as it approached Kinsale. Despite its damage, U-93 managed to struggle back to Sylt nine days later. In the meantime, the damaged First Prize returned to her port of Milford Haven. The Admiralty had renamed her, and she was to now be known as HMS Prize. After Prize was repaired, she returned to sea in late May, conducting a second patrol off the northwest coast of Ireland for three weeks. On 12 June, she encountered on the surface. The U-boat shelled Prize 30 times as it approached but once a wounded Sanders gave the order to return fire, it turned away. Prize only fired a few shots before the U-boat quickly submerged and got away. Prize undertook another patrol in late June and early July. On 22 June, while at sea, various awards to the crew who fought in the action on 30 April was announced; Sanders was to receive the Victoria Cross while his lieutenant received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), two other officers the Distinguished Service Cross, and the rest of the crew the Distinguished Service Medal. Prize embarked on her final patrol in early August 1917. Sailing into the Atlantic under a Swedish flag, the ship was accompanied by a British submarine, . It was intended that D6 would submerge and observe Prize throughout the day. When an enemy ship was sighted, the crew of Prize would place discrete signals in the rigging to indicate the ship's position to the watching D6. The submarine would then attempt to move into a position where it could torpedo the approaching enemy. On 13 August 1917, a lookout spotted . Sanders opted to use the guns of Prize to shell the U-boat; UB-48 was undamaged and it submerged to evade the attack. Prize and D6 remained on station. Later that evening, UB-48, having worked its way into a suitable position, fired two torpedoes at Prize, one of which struck and destroyed the sailing ship. D6, still submerged, heard the explosion and at dawn it surfaced to investigate but found no trace of Prize or her crew.

Biography  van Winter was born in Amsterdam in 1793. She was the daughter of Pieter van Winter, a merchant, and Anna Louisa van der Poorten. Her paternal grandfather was the poet Nicolaas Simon van Winter. She had a brother and a half sister. Due to the business success of her father and grandfather, the van Winter family was well off financially, and so Annewies grew up amidst wealth. Her family was also in possession of a substantial collection (amounting to over 180 works) of 17th century Dutch and Flemish art, some of which was by masters such as Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer. Just before her father died in 1807, he stipulated in his will that the van Winter's art collection should not be broken up until all three of his children were either married or 25 years in age. As she was 14 at the time, Annewies and followed her older sister Lucretia when the latter moved to a new home on the Herengracht in Amsterdam. There, Lucretia began to use parts of her considerable inheritance to buy new paintings for the van Winter's collection; she made these purchases in secret so the newly-acquired paintings would not be included in her father's soon to be decided collection. Lucretia also introduced Annewies to literature, poetry, music, and art collecting. During this time Annewies became acquainted with Willem van Loon (1794-1847), and in 1815 the two announced their engagement. This allowed the family to begin dividing their art collection; Annewies and Lucretia divided the collection between them after buying out their brother's share. Following her marriage, Annewies continued to acquire more paintings for her collection. When her sister died in 1845, Annewies required some of her paintings, bringing her collection to around 80 paintings. Her husband Willem died two years later in 1847, leaving Annewies as the sole heir to his estate. When Annewies died in 1877 at the age of 84, her children sold her collection to Gustave baron de Rothschild of the French Rothschilds. This sale was controversial, and sparked claims that the artistic heritage of the Netherlands was being lost. This in turn helped to spur the effort to create an organization to preserve dutch art, later known as the Rembrandt Association.

It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018, and was released on March 29, 2019, by Saban Films. Plot Sadie is a woman attending a support group following her abandonment of her husband. She works as a vigilante, helping men, women, and children escape abusive homes. She struggles with money, asking for whatever the people she helps can give and attempting to redeem a life insurance policy after her husband goes missing. Sadie is invited to the home of Andrea (Betsy Aidem) and Michael Shaund (C.J. Wilson) under the pretense of working for medical insurance. Sadie instead beats up Michael and forces him to transfer his money to his wife and leave their home. Sadie tells Andrea to pass on her details to anyone she feels needs them. Sadie then rescues a young boy and his infant brother from their drug-addled mother, who had been keeping the infant locked away. She tells the boy to leave the house and seek help, refusing to do any more for them. In group therapy, Sadie confesses her past: Her husband wanted her and her young son to move out of their home and live off the grid. When she tried to escape with her son, he chased them both with a knife and killed their son in a fit of rage. Sadie returns to her old home, finding some of her son's belongings there. She notices a poster for Lake Placid that had been left behind, and decides to travel there. In a lodge, she finds a map that she recognizes from her old home, and is then ambushed by her husband. Sadie wakes up bound, her husband (Morgan Spector) taunting her and welcoming her back home. After a lengthy struggle and chase, she overpowers and kills her husband, dumping his body on the road for the police to find. Sadie returns to her attorney, who tells her that since the police found her husband's body, and don't seem willing to look further into the case considering the lack of evidence and his criminal record, that the life insurance claim will be processed. Sadie then leaves, traveling again to help another woman that had contacted her.

History  Historically, issues surrounding powers of attorney were based on the common law concept of agency. However, as states began enacting varying statutes to create a statutory framework for the durable powers of attorney, variations from state to state prompted support for a uniform law. In 1969, the ULC promulgated the Uniform Probate Code, which created a basis for a national framework for powers of attorney. However, since a normal power of attorney ends once its purpose has been fulfilled or the principle is incapacitated, states made a distinction between this normal power of attorney and a durable power of attorney, which \\"remains in effect even when the principal becomes incapacitated.\\" This prompted to ULC to create a uniform law regarding Durable Power of Attorney, which superseded the original Uniform Probate Code.  Act  The UPOAA was designed to correct shortcomings of both the Uniform Probate Code and the Durable Power of Attorney by superseding them both. It consisted of four distinct articles: # The general rules governing the \\"creation and use\\" of power of attorney # The definitions used by the UPOAA # An optional form for use in granting power of attorney # Other miscellaneous provisions regarding the UPOAA and other power of attorney laws  Adoption  The ULC officially approved of the UPOAA and recommend that states adopt it in 2006. As of 2019, 26 states have adopted and enacted the UPOAA.

It was the first public theatre in Oslo and in Norway, and the predecessor of the Christiania Theatre. The theatre was founded by the Swedish theatre director Johan Peter Str√∂mberg. With the exception of the unsuccessful attempt of Martin N√ºrenbach in 1772, there was no public theatre in Oslo or anywhere in Norway prior to 1827. Theatre was performed by foreign travelling theatre companies, or privately by Det Dramatiske Selskab. Str√∂mberg wished to establish a professional public theatre in Norway, with professional native actors. He obtained a theater permit from the Danish crown, and founded the first dramatic school in 1825 in order to train the first group of native actors. In 30 January 1827, the theatre was inaugurated with a performance of Str√∂mberg's students, the pioneer group of Norwegian actors. However, the Norwegian actors was not considered trained enough to meet the standards of the audience, and Str√∂mberg was forced to engage trained actors from Denmark. On 4 November 1827, Str√∂mberg performed his play Fredsfesten in praise of the unpopular Swedish- Norwegian Union, which attracted great criticism. In the spring of 1828, Str√∂mberg was declared bankrupt, rented the theatre and the theatre permit to one of his Danish actors, Jens Lang B√∏cher, and returned to Sweden. Jens Lang B√∏cher replaced almost all of the Norwegian staff with Danes, allowing only five Norwegians to remain. On 22 June 1832, Str√∂mberg sold the theatre to the director Carl Anton Saabye, after which it was renamed to Christiania Offentlige Theater. The first opera performed in public in Norway, Deux mots by Nicolas Dalayrac, was performed here in 1831, directed by August Schrumpf with Augusta Smith in the main role. The theatre burned down on 5 November 1835, after which the theatre company performed in the house of the Det Dramatiske Selskab until the Christiania Theatre was inaugurated on 4 October 1837.

It uses many of the principles of software engineering, but it is specific to the development of distributed systems.  History  When the first experimental and commercial computer networks were developed in the 1970s, the concept of protocols was not yet well developed. These were the first distributed systems. In the context of the newly adopted layered protocol architecture (see OSI model), the definition of the protocol of a specific layer should be such that any entity implementing that specification in one computer would be compatible with any other computer containing an entity implementing the same specification, and their interactions should be such that the desired communication service would be obtained. On the other hand, the protocol specification should be abstract enough to allow different choices for the implementation on different computers. It was recognized that a precise specification of the expected service provided by the given layer was important G. v. Bochmann and C. A. Sunshine, Formal methods in communication protocol design, IEEE Tr. COM-28, No. 4 (April 1980), pp. 624-631.. It is important for the verification of the protocol, which should demonstrate that the communication service is provided if both protocol entities implement the protocol specification correctly. This principle was later followed during the standardization of the OSI protocol stack, in particular for the transport layer. It was also recognized that some kind of formalized protocol specification would be useful for the verification of the protocol and for developing implementations, as well as test cases for checking the conformance of an implementation against the specification See the series of conferences on Protocol Specification Testing and Verification (PSTV) since 1981.. While initially mainly finite-state machine were used as (simplified) models of a protocol entity G. v. Bochmann, D. Rayner and C. H. West, Some notes on the history of protocol engineering, Computer Networks journal, 54 (2010), pp 3197‚Äì3209., in the 1980s three formal specification languages were standardized, two by ISO C. A. Vissers, G. v. Bochmann and R. L. Tenney, Formal description techniques, Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 71, 12, pp. 1356-1364, Dec. 1983. and one by ITU G.J. Dickson ; P.E. de Chazal, Status of CCITT description techniques and application to protocol specification, Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 71, 12, pp. 1346-1355 (1983)..

Principles  Layered protocol architecture Layered protocol architecture: More abstract view ‚Äì showing the communication service provided. The following are the most important principles for the development of protocols: * Layered architecture: A protocol layer at the level n consists of two (or more) entities that have a service interface through which the service of the layer is provided to the users of the protocol, and which uses the service provided by a local entity of level (n-1). * The service specification of a layer describes, in an abstract and global view, the behavior of the layer as visible at the service interfaces of the layer. * The protocol specification defines the requirements that should be satisfied by each entity implementation. * Protocol verification consists of showing that two (or more) entities satisfying the protocol specification will provide at their service interfaces the specified service of that layer. * The (verified) protocol specification is used mainly for the following two activities: # The development of an entity implementation. Note that the abstract properties of the service interface are defined by the service specification (and also used by the protocol specification), but the detailed nature of the interface can be chosen during the implementation process, separately for each entity. # Test suite development for conformance testing. Protocol conformance testing checks that a given entity implementation conforms to the protocol specification. The conformance test cases are developed based on the protocol specification and are applicable to all entity implementations. Therefore standard conformance test suites have been developed for certain protocol standards.  Methods and tools  Tools for the activities of protocol verification, entity implementation and test suite development can be developed when the protocol specification is written in a formalized language which can be understood by the tool. As mentioned, formal specification languages have been proposed for protocol specification, and the first methods and tools where based on finite-state machine models. Reachability analysis was proposed to understand all possible behaviors of a distributed system, which is essential for protocol verification. This was later complemented with model checking. However, finite-state descriptions are not powerful enough to describe constraints between message parameters and the local variables in the entities. Such constraints can be described by the standardized formal specification languages mentioned above, for which powerful tools have been developed. It is in the field of protocol engineering that model-based development was used very early. These methods and tools have later been used for software engineering as well as hardware design, especially for distributed and real-time systems. On the other hand, many methods and tools developed in the more general context of software engineering can also be used of the development of protocols, for instance model checking for protocol verification, and agile methods for entity implementations.  Constructive methods for protocol design  Most protocols are designed by human intuition and discussions during the standardization process. However, some methods have been proposed for using constructive methods possibly supported by tools to automatically derive protocols that satisfy certain properties. The following are a few examples: * Semi-automatic protocol synthesisP. Zafiropulo, C. West, H. Rudin, D. Cowan, D. Brand : Towards analyzing and synthesizing protocols, IEEE Transactions on Communications ( Volume: 28, Issue: 4, Apr 1980 ) : The user defines all message sending actions of the entities, and the tool derives all necessary reception actions (even if several messages are in transit). * Synchronizing protocolM.G. Gouda and Y.T. Yu, Synthesis of communicating Finite State Machines with guaranteed progress, IEEE Trans. on Comm., vol. Com-32, No. 7, July 1984, pp. 779-788.: The state transitions of one protocol entity are given by the user, and the method derives the behavior of the other entity such that it remains in states that correspond to the former entity. * Protocol derived from service specificationM.F. Al-hammouri and G.v. Bochmann, Realizability of service specifications, Proc. System Analysis and Modelling (SAM) conference 2018, Copenhagen, LNCS, Springer.: The service specification is given by the user and the method derives a suitable protocol for all entities. * Protocol for control applicationsG. v. Bochmann, Using logic to solve the submodule construction problem, Journal on Discrete Event Dynamic Systems, Vol. 23 (1), Springer, March 2013, pp. 27-59.: The specification of one entity (called the plant - which must be controlled) is given, and the method derives a specification of the other entity such that certain fail states of the plant are never reached and certain given properties of the plant's service interactions are satisfied. This is a case of supervisory control.  Books * Ming T. Liu, Protocol Engineering, Advances in Computers, Volume 29, 1989, Pages 79-195. * G.J.

The administrative centre was the small village of Bj√∏rnskinn where Bj√∏rnskinn Church is located. The largest village in Bj√∏rnskinn was the village of Ris√∏yhamn. History The municipality of Andenes was established on 1 January 1924 when Dverberg Municipality was divided into three: Andenes (population: 2,213) in the north, Bj√∏rnskinn (population: 1,410) in the south, and Dverberg (population: 1,477) in the central part of the old municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Andenes (population: 3,812) was merged (back) with the municipalities of Dverberg (population: 1,719) and Bj√∏rnskinn (population: 1,835) to create the new And√∏y Municipality.

Early life As a young girl, after watching a performance of the broadway show \\"Annie,\\" she decided early on that she would try to develop her talent as a singer. She began singing in dinner theaters in her area and continued on to regional talent shows and singing competitions. She has appeared in commercials for the Ronald McDonald house and diabetes awareness. After having suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction at an early age, Roberts has been sober since May 1997. She also suffered from a rare congenital heart condition that almost proved fatal. Career Hilary is signed to her own label Red Songbird, and through it released her single \\"There for You\\". She collaborates closely with award- winning producers and songwriters, Damon Sharpe and Eric Sanicola, who have worked on a number of her tracks. Roberts returned for a second run on Dance Club Songs, debuting at No. 47 with \\"Back to Life\\", a cover of Soul II Soul's 30-year-old pop/R&B; smash \\"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me),\\" featuring Caron Wheeler, which spent three weeks at No. 1 in August-September 1989. Her rendition was remixed by Andrew Wilson and Richard Cutmore, the Perry Twins (duo) and Wideboys, among others. Roberts told Billboard, \\"I was at dinner with Dauman Music label owner Jason Dauman,...my producer Damon Sharpe and we were talking about old-school songs that had a huge impact. I started singing 'Back to Life' and Jason said, 'You sound great singing that song. You should really consider redoing it.' I hadn't thought about singing it before because Soul II Soul's performance with Caron Wheeler's incredible vocals was extremely powerful. It was a bit intimidating to tackle this incredible song, but my team said, 'Let's do this!'\\" Her third single, \\"Fight to the Other Side\\" was released in May 2019 in honor of her friend, who suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy known as FSHD. It was co-written by Roberts, Sharpe, Greer and Christopher McDonald. An accompanying music video was directed by Liz Imperio and shot with critically acclaimed dancers Michael Dameski and Charity Anderson. Charitable work In May 2019, Hilary launched the Red Songbird Foundation at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The Red Songbird Foundation, which began its work in 2009, celebrated its public launch in 2019 and aims to help survivors of trauma caused by sexual, physical and verbal abuse. Terry Crews hosted the event and other stars, such as Jermaine Dupri, James Maslow, Chloe Lukasiak, Clinton Sparks, Pixie Lott, Austin Mahone, and Mario Lopez were also in attendance.

Early life Iguchi raised in Akihabara„ÉªUeno„ÉªOkachi-machi, Tokyo. From early childhood, she had yet to develop her interest in film-making, and simply enjoyed watching movies with cute girl characters. Moreover, during her childhood, she was more interested with professional wrestling and music than movies. However, she has said that the Kawanaka Nobuhiro quote \\"You can make a movie with personal taste\\" is what inspired her to make films. As a result, she entered the Image Forum Institute of Image Studies at age 20.  Career  In 2001, she directed the film Inuneko, which later received the Pia Film Festival Planning Award. In 2003, she won the Japan Movie Professional Awards Newcomer Director Award. In 2004, the remake version of Inuneko won the Jury Special Award, the International Critics Federation Prize, and the Best Screen Play Award at the Torino International Film Festival. In the same year, she received the 2004 Japan Film Director Association Newcomer Director Award. Iguchi later directed Don't Laugh at My Romance, starring Matsuyama Kenichi, which was released in 2008. In 2014, she directed the film Nishino Yukihiko no Koi to B≈çken, which starred Yutaka Takenouchi.  Styles  According to the actress Hiromi Nagasaku, who starred in Don‚Äôt Laugh at My Romance, \\"the director did not call any cuts after the main scene, so the improvised ad-lib was difficult‚Äù. In her work, director Iguchi often does not cut the scene until the last second of the act. In addition, Iguchi says, ‚ÄúI understand that the tension of the actor goes up and down when shooting a scene. Sometimes actors‚Äô tension goes down once, but it rises right after. When this happens, it is difficult to make a cut. Although I sometimes hesitate to make a cut, I would like to let the actors‚Äô improvisation flow and see how the scene go in case it gets interesting.‚Äù For this reason, her work has a unique style that is more leisurely and relaxed because of her long shots.

He then places Samira in the boot of his rental car and proceeds to flee the scene as Samira's family and their friends find the guard dead and Samira missing. Jay eventually removes the duct tape from Samira‚Äôs mouth and explains why he kidnapped her. It is revealed that Samira was actually expecting Jay because it turns out that she was in an arranged marriage and she's in love with another man, her Indian boyfriend Deepesh, the man who hired Jay. Jay then gives Samira the choice to continue to Lahore and meet Deepesh or return to her family and arranged marriage. Samira chooses to continue to Lahore with Jay. Samira asks Jay to remove the hood from her head and to untie her hands. At first he refuses, but eventually agrees to remove her restraints. From Lahore they cross the Indo- Pak border to reach Amritsar. Jay purchases 5 burner phones and 10 SIM cards and attempts to reach Deepesh. Samira tells Jay that the number he has for Deepesh is for his UK mobile and that he also has a local number. Jay eventually reaches Deepesh who tells Jay that he is not at the rendezvous in Amritsar and is still in London but reassured him that he will be in India the following day. The kidnapping and killing of the guard makes the international news which causes complications, and Deepesh quickly changes his mind about bringing Samira out. In New Delhi the following day, Deepesh tells Jay to dump Samira back in Pakistan and put everything back as it was. Jay agrees but tells Deepesh he will need a further ¬£20,000. Back at the hotel, Jay tells Samira that Deepesh doesn't want to see her and told Jay to take her back to Pakistan. She tells Jay that she does not want to do this but that she wants to see Deepesh before she does anything else. The next day in Jaipur, Jay meets Deepesh who gives him half of the money for transporting Samira back to Pakistan. Deepesh tells Jay he will have the other half of his money once the job is complete. However Jay tells him that they will not see each other again, so he needs all of his money beforehand. Deepesh tells Jay that he can have the other half of the money the following day. Jay tells Deepesh to make a reservation at a hotel out of town and that he and Samira will meet him and go there together. The next day, Deepesh collects Jay and Samira from town, and the three set off for the hotel in Deepesh's SUV. During the journey, Samira asks if she and Deepesh can speak in private. Jay agrees and tells Deepesh to pull over so he can get out of the vehicle; he continues driving until Jay pulls his pistol on him. Jay asks Deepesh for the balance of his money before exiting the car leaving Samira and Deepesh to talk. From a distance Jay can hear Deepesh and Samira arguing and sees Deepesh turn violent towards Samira. Jay returns to the car and drags Deepesh out of his seat. The pair fight, and while Jay turns back to check on Samira, Deepesh attacks him with a rock. Jay retaliates and ends up killing Deepesh with the rock. Samira starts the SUV, reverses out onto the road, and calls Jay on his phone. She asks if she can trust him to which he replies she cannot, but she chooses to offer him a deal. She and Deepesh were intending to sell a hoard of diamonds stolen from his family vault - forged replacements for which had been left in their place which would not be found to be fake unless sold - and disappear to live off the proceeds. She offers to split the jewels with Jay and they both go their separate ways to which he agrees. Jay leaves Samira with Deepesh's body and leaves to get petrol and supplies to dispose of the body. Upon his return he incinerates Deepesh's body, and the pair head to the hotel to use Deepesh's reservation, with Jay assuming Deepesh's identity. At the hotel they intend to create a diversionary tale that they are travelling to Nepal. Samira and Jay then sell the SUV to a local fence who puts them in touch with a buyer for the jewels. The jeweller refuses to handle the sale of the diamond given that the value of one stone they show him exceeds US$100,000, a value for which he has no buyers. Jay and Samira return to the hotel and spend the night together. The pair then head for Goa where they rent a house for the winter and plan to live there together funded by proceeds of the sale of the diamonds. One morning Jay wakes to find Samira gone. She calls him to tell him that she is sorry that she left but that while she can not, he can go home because no one knows who he is. Jay thanks her for leaving him some money. Samira tells Jay that she will miss him. Samira cuts off the call after Jay tells her that if she needs anything she can call him. The film ends with Samira riding a bus while Jay sits alone in their rented home.

Although Cambodia is undergoing significant urbanization, most of its citizens continue to live in rural areas and experience poverty. Cambodia has made progress in combating poverty, and many citizens have risen just above the poverty line, but there is still a high number of people experiencing the devastating effects of poverty, including malnutrition and lack of access to basic health care services. Statistics from 2014 showed that about 13.5% of the country's total population continue to live in extreme poverty, down from 53% in 2004.  Context  = Poverty levels in the 1990s = In order to estimate the poverty levels in Cambodia, the government carried out its first large-scale national survey. The level of poverty in rural areas was estimated at about 45 percent, which was four times that of the capital city. The outcome of the study made it possible for the country to come up with the First Socioeconomic Development Plan that was to run from 1996 to 2000. = Regional dimensions = An assessment of the poverty situation in Cambodia reveals patterns of regional variations. Some of the provinces record a high poverty rate compared to others. Areas with high poverty rates include Ratanak Kiri, Kampong Thom, and Preah Vihear. According to a study conducted, Ratanak Kiri had a poverty rate of 55.2 percent, Preah Vihear had a poverty rate of 72.3 percent, and Kampong Thom had a poverty rate of 75.8 percent.The inequality in the regional distribution of wealth is attributable to low literacy levels. A high number of people in Cambodia live in poverty especially the ones who live in rural areas. Globally, individuals living in rural areas record more elevated levels of lack compared to their counterparts living in urban areas. About 80 percent of the population in Cambodia live in rural areas. By 2012, the rural poverty rate was about 28.8 percent, accounting for three times urban poverty rate which stood at 6.4 percent at the same time.Asian Development Bank, Cambodia: Addressing the Skills Gap: Employment Diagnostic Study, 2015, p. 4. Over time, poverty has dramatically reduced in both rural and urban areas. However, one thing is real that the remaining poverty is more concentrated in rural areas. = Gender dimensions = Cambodian women experience higher levels of poverty compared to men. Although women participation in the labor force in Cambodia has increased from 76 to 80 percent in the years between 2008 and 2012, there are prominent gender inequalities in employment.Ministry of Women Affairs, Women Economic Empowerment. Cambodia Gender Assessment, 2014, p. 3. Women participation in unpaid domestic work constrains their economic advancement. Women continue to participate significantly in the vulnerable employment sector, especially in agriculture. Gender wage gap remains high with women concentration in the low paying jobs such as forestry and retail trade. Just a small percent of women engage in highly paid employment occupations such as managers and technicians. Women have low levels of required skills to participate in meaningful employment and they also experience difficulties due to discrimination practices. In the long run, women suffer worse economic conditions compared to men and the rise in the number of female-headed households worsens the situation. Again, women are the primary caregivers, and they spend a lot of money on household consumption. Therefore, they have less money to save or buy assets.  Poverty Reduction Measures  The government of Cambodia has come up with numerous ways to try and reduce the level of poverty. For instance, it instituted the National Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2002 aimed at reducing the poverty levels in the country. The government is putting in place strategies that will see an increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the country. The government also welcomed the participation of the NGO's in the eradication of poverty. Given that the strategy that was launched in 2002 and has seen little success, the government has reworked its policy framework to ensure a greater inclusion of NGO's and better coordination of the process of eradicating poverty. It came up with the Second Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP II)JICA. Section 5. Development Plans of Cambodia - JICA https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/IFIC_and_JBICI-Studies/.../pdf/cambodia_07.pdf that would remove duplication of tasks and allow a more inclusive approach instead of the government bearing all the burden of improving the socioeconomic situation of the country. Under the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), the government welcomes the NGO's in eradicating poverty in the country. Working with the NGOs is guided by the Rectangular Strategy that looks at factors such as peace, partnership in development, regional and international integration, and creating favorable financial and macroeconomic environment. In 2013, the government of Cambodia implemented \\"Rectangular Strategy - Phase III\\" for growth, employment, equity, and efficiency. This strategy focused on ensuring an average economic growth of 7%, establishing more job for its citizens especially youth, reducing poverty by 1% every year, and strengthening institutional capacity and governance.  Increased Vulnerability to Poverty  Cambodia has experienced a tremendous drop in poverty but there is a high chance of relapsing to poverty. Poverty rate in Cambodia dropped from 52.2 percent in 2004 to 20.5 percent in 2011. However, most of the individuals only moved from a state of being poor to state of being vulnerable to becoming poor. Most of the individuals only moved just above the poverty line. A research reveals that a small shock of about US$0.30 per day would, equal to the price of two water bottles, lead to doubling the poverty status in Cambodia. The high number of individuals who are nearing the poverty line are like to fall into multi-dimensional poverty if they experience shock from drought, unemployment or sickness. As of 2018, report from UNDP illustrates that at least thirty-five percent of Cambodians still live in poverty. Eradicating all forms of poverty remains the most significant challenge facing humanity. The nation of Cambodia is not any different since even after making considerable strides to get away from poverty, the country has a high number of people who are vulnerable to becoming poor. Individuals experience poverty in different ways in their lives including the inability to access health care, the failure to earn enough income to cater for their needs and the failure to complete schooling. Such is the situation in Cambodia where there is a high number of people working in agriculture and informal employment.  Indicators of Poverty  = Macroeconomics = The macroeconomic indicators reveal the extent of poverty in the overall economy of Cambodia. Cambodia recorded a Gross Domestic Product of 16.7 billions in 2014, placing the country as accounting only for 0.7 percent of the economic activity of the entire ASEAN region.Asian Development Bank, Cambodia: Addressing the Skills Gap: Employment Diagnostic Study, 2015, p. 5. The low GDP placed the country as the poorest country in the region. At the same time, Cambodia recorded a stronger relative economic performance compared to others ASEAN countries. = Labor Force Characteristics = A high number of rural people participate in agricultural activities. A high population of individuals living the country works in the farming sector. Research reveals that about 33.3 percent of the total employed population in Cambodia work in the agricultural industry.United States Agency for international Development, Health Financing Profile: Cambodia, 2016, p.5. Similar to other developing countries, the citizens who engage in the farming sector suffer the vulnerability of climate shocks including flooding and drought. At the same, the prices of agricultural products are likely to be low due to their high supply, especially after the dry season. There is widespread lack of job security in Cambodia. A vast majority of the Cambodians work in the informal sector, and they experience widespread employment vulnerabilities. A survey by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of Cambodia revealed that 60.2 percent of the citizens worked in the informal sector.National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of Cambodia, Cambodia Labor Force a Child Survey, 2013, p. 2. The number of individuals working in the casual industry is even higher when those working in the agricultural sector are added to the group. Job insecurity is widespread in the informal sector, and individuals can quickly become unemployed. The casual sector employment attracts low wages, and the workers can barely make any savings to improve their economic situation. Informal sector employment does not have insurance and pension benefits, thus worsening the financial condition of the already impoverished individuals. Cambodia has high levels of youth unemployment. The country recorded a low unemployment rate of about 0.3 percent in 2014. However, detailed assessments of the labor market show problematic and high levels of youth unemployment especially the youths living in urban areas. A survey by the National Institute of Statistics of Cambodia revealed that about 202,304 Cambodian nationals aged above 15 years are unemployed. The high levels of youth unemployment contribute to a high dependency ratio at the family level and increased pressure on the available resources at the family level. Unemployment contributes to lack of income and following poor standards of living. Also, there is a current trend involving movement from the agricultural sector to the industry and the services sector. However, there is stagnation in the productivity in the industries. Still, the sectorial shifts have not done much in leading to employment in the occupations requiring high skills. = Poor Health Outcomes = Lack of access to sanitation and water facilities continue to pose a significant challenge to the health care system. Only 18 percent of the entire rural populations have access to improved sanitation and water facilities.Halvorson, Jeff. Improving Health Outcomes of Children in Cambodia: A Policy Analysis for the Pacha Youth Foundation. The Evans School Review, vol. 4, no.1. Moreover, only 56 percent of the individuals living in rural areas have access to drinking water. Like many other developing countries, most of the common diseases experienced in the country are attributable to problems of water and sanitation. Cambodia has high levels of infant mortality due to malnutrition and associated complications. The infant mortality rate in Cambodia is higher compared to any other country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Cambodia has a high mortality rate of about 30 percent. Moreover, the five key top killers of young children included malnutrition which accounts for 11 percent of deaths. Another study revealed that 30 percent of the children living in the rural areas of the country are underweight. The situation regarding the number of high underweight children persists despite the government measures to increased food intake. The high number of underweight children is highly related to poor diet. The urban poor in Cambodia move among hungry days (one or two meals of low-quality rice with fish sauce or sour soup); filling days (two meals of better-quality rice and soup with vegetables and fish); and good days (three meals of high-quality rice, varied vegetables and protein, and fruit). Food security is affected by debt, natural disasters, an insufficient public safety net, and low and irregular incomes. Cambodia continues to battle with lifestyle diseases, sex work for money, and poor living conditions. The critical health problems in the country include tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. An approximate number of 75,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS.United States Agency for international Development. Health Financing Profile: Cambodia, 2016, p. 2. The HIV prevalence rate stands at 0.6 percent of the adult population. In 2014 alone, the country spent about US$50.2 million in handling HIV issues. Diseases are an indication of poverty and they propagate poverty in the long run since they lead to the use of a significant amount of money that would otherwise be used for economic development. = Poor Education Outcomes = Economic struggles contribute to poor education outcomes in the country. Education is expensive for individuals who cannot access basic human needs. There are high levels of school dropout rates in the country as the young children seek employment to provide for their economic needs. The state continues to experience high levels of illiteracy. By 2011, just 29 percent of the adults who are above 25 years of age had attained primary school education ‚Äî also, illiteracy levels among the individuals who are between 15‚Äì24 years of age amount to 11.1 percent.Asian Development Bank, Cambodia: Addressing the Skills Gap: Employment Diagnostic Study, 2015, p. 11. A look at the enrollment rates reveals the extent of poverty in hindering educational advancement for a high number of children in the country. In 2011, the enrollment rates in primary school amounted to 48.8 percent in 2011 while the net enrollment rate in secondary schools school amounted to 54.2 percent. Generally, the education outcomes in Cambodia are lower than the average level for the poor countries.

It is the sequel to Iron Soldier. Set after the events of the first game, players assume the role of an elite defense pilot taking control of the titular mech in order to complete tasks and protect areas that conforms the United Republic from attacks of the PENTA corporation, a former rival of the now-disbanded Iron Fist Corporation. Conceived after release of the original title and originally announced in 1995, Iron Soldier 2 went almost unreleased after Atari discontinued both platforms and merged with JT Storage in 1996 until it was eventually picked up by Telegames, making it one of the last licensed titles for each system. Iron Soldier 2 received very positive reception from critics with praise towards the graphics, soundtrack, controls, gameplay, difficulty and variety, while it received criticism for lack of music during gameplay on the cartridge version. It has been referred by publications such as Retro Gamer as one of the best titles for each platform. A sequel, Iron Soldier 3, which was released in 2000 for the PlayStation and in 2001 for the Nuon respectively.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Iron Soldier 2 is a mech simulation game with free- roaming elements that is primarily played in a first-person perspective like its predecessor.Iron Soldier 2 game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) The player takes control of the titular robot across 20 missions, each one varying in main objectives to complete such as acquiring new weapons and fighting against other Iron Soldier units, in order to stop attacks from PENTA corporation against the United Republic. The progress system acts similarly to the original game, where the first set of five missions must be completed in order to unlock another set. The player now starts with three selectable weapons instead of only one and controls are relatively the same as with the first game. In addition to the returning enemy units from the original game, new ones are introduced in the sequel such as walker-like vehicles. Though progress after completing five missions and other setting changes are kept automatically via the internal EEPROM on the cartridge version, a Memory Track cartridge must be present on the CD version in order to save progress and settings.  Plot  After the defeat of Iron Fist Corporation, the Resistance formed a democratic government called United Republic. However, problems begin to arise when the PENTA corporation, a longtime rival of Iron Fist, are occupying areas from their former enemy and starts attacking the newly formed republic. As a result, a pilot from the defense force of the republic is assigned to take control of an Iron Soldier unit in order to defend republican territories against terrorist attacks from PENTA.  Development and release  Although conceived after the release of Iron Soldier and planned for a 1996 release, Iron Soldier 2 would not be released until a year after both the Jaguar and Jaguar CD were officially discontinued. Atari Corporation requested Marc Rosocha and his team at Eclipse Software Design to start work on a sequel to Iron Soldier for the Atari Jaguar CD shortly after the game was released on the Jaguar. Development began after Eclipse obtained development kits for the Jaguar CD from Atari Corp., who were looking to publish \\"killer app\\" titles for the peripheral. Rosocha stated that Iron Soldier 2 would have been completed if they were not creating it for both cartridge and CD-ROM formats, with the former version being developed on Alpine development kits. The game was formally announced in video game magazines in 1995 for a Q4 1995/January 1996 release but only listing the CD version, with internal documents from Atari listing it as still being in development on August of the same year. Iron Soldier 2 features improved graphics with additional texture mapping while exploiting the system's hardware to improve visuals over those of the original game. The project was near completion by the end of 1995, however, the team received news from Attention to Detail (best known for Cybermorph and Battlemorph) that they were no longer working on new titles for the platform due to rumors of Atari preparing to exit the home video game console business and as a result, Rosocha proceeded to contact then-product development director John Skruch at the company in regards to these rumors. A few weeks later, the team received information from Skruch that executives at Atari decided to put on hold upcoming software for the system and confirmed that the company was also exiting the console market, however, other internal documents from the company listed the game as still in development on December 1995. Iron Soldier 2 remained being previewed in magazines and was also showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari in January 1996, however, the company started cancelling upcoming projects for the system such as Black ICEWhite Noise and Thea Realm Fighters in the next month before merging with JTS in a reverse takeover and filed a 10-K405 SEC Filing two months later, which meant that the game would not be published by Atari until it was finished and released in 1997 by Telegames. The game was originally planned to feature a two-player mode, with Scott Le Grand of 4Play (known for his work on BattleSphere) stating that Atari requested a working network code to be implemented into the game for multiplayer but this feature was scrapped in the final version of the game. Iron Soldier 2 was released on December 30, 1997 for the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD by Telegames, becoming one of the first titles on the platform to be released on both formats. Being a late release after the discontinuation of both platforms, the game could be purchased either through direct order from Telegames' US and UK websites or retailers such as Electronics Boutique. Differences between the cartridge and CD versions are the lack of full motion video cutscenes and Red Book audio, among others changes. Before being finished and released for both systems, Rosocha approached Sega for a potential port of the game to the Sega Saturn and despite liking the offer, members from the company talked with him and stated that the system was not going to be a success, and that the team could have a similar situation with Atari and as such, work on the port was never started. Plans to release the game on Macintosh, PC and PlayStation were also slated but never released as well. In March 2017, a ROM image of an early 1995 build of the cartridge version was leaked online by video game collector Fr√©d√©ric Moreau at AtariAge.  Reception  Iron Soldier 2 received very positive reviews from reviewers. ST-Computer gave a positive review in regards to the title. The game also received a perfect score by Ralph Karels from German magazine Video Games.  Sequel  A sequel, Iron Soldier 3, was released on both PlayStation and Nuon in 2000 and 2001 respectively.

Idaho's Proposition 2 is an initiative which addressed the proposed Medicaid gap within the state. This Ballot Initiative was approved and qualified to be included for voting on July 17th, 2018 through campaigning and petitioning for signatures to acquire the necessary support of the voting Idaho population to be included for state- wide voting through the 2018 General Election ballot. This initiative moved to expand Medicaid to persons who did not previously qualify. Proposition 2 would expand Medicaid coverage to persons under the age of 65 if their income is below 133% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) and are unable to gain medical insurance or coverage through other means. The estimated amount for Medicaid expansion in Idaho is 105 million dollars. Many studies have found that in total expansion states have saved around 6.2 billion dollars in uncompensated care between 2013 and 2015.  Campaign and supporters  A grassroots canvassing drive was held in order to gain enough signatures of registered voters in the prerequisite number of legislative districts in order to place the proposition on the ballot for the 2018 midterm elections. The drive was able to successfully obtain the needed number of signatures, a total of 56,192 signatures in at least 18 of the 35 state's legislative districts, and by the end of the drive over 70,000 signatures were collected. Within the campaigning and petitioning portion to gain access to this proposition being listed on the election ballot, there were many officials and organizations that supported this Medicare expansion and worked to help gain the necessary support to allow this topic to be added onto the 2018 General Election voting Ballot in Idaho. Medicaid expansion was supported by many officials, among the supports was the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paulette Jordan. There were two major committees that supported Proposition 2 and played a large role within the campaigning and petitioning to get enough support to warrant Proposition 2 onto the 2018 General Election Ballot were the Idahoans for Healthcare and Reclaim Idaho. Together the committees managed to raise nearly two million dollars in support of the proposition. Methodist Cathedral of the Rockies. There were also many persons and organizations that did not support Proposition 2, primarily the newly formed political action committee Work, Not Obamacare PAC, an offshoot of the Idaho Freedom Foundation.  Proposition  The proposition was designed to address the Medicare gap that existed within the state by expanding Medicaid eligibility. The full text of the ballot read: > \\"Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That > Chapter 2, Title 56, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the > addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and designated as Section > 56-267, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 56-267.

The department is required and > authorized to take all actions necessary to implement the provisions of this > section as soon as practicable.\\" County results  Voting  Approximately 66.8% of the 612,536 registered voters that turned out for the November 6th, 2018 General Election voted on Proposition 2. The results were in favor for the proposition, with 60.6% of voters supporting and 39.4% opposing.  Alteration  This initiative was later modified to include requirements for Medicaid recipients to meet further qualifications to gain eligibility for the expanded program through the establishment of Senate Bill 1204. The official legislation in regards to this Senate Bill can be found _here_. This alteration added requirements to ensure working hours, education hours, volunteerism, or qualification in programs such was TANF or SNAP to gain access to the expanded Medicaid benefits. The Legislative Alteration verbiage is listed below: > ‚Äú Legislative alteration: Senate Bill 1204 was passed in the state > legislature on April 5, 2019, and signed by the governor on April 9, 2019. > SB 1204 was designed to require Medicaid recipients to do the following: > 1.Work at least 20 hours per week or earn wages equal to or greater than the > federal minimum wage ($7.25 per hour as of 2019) for 20 hours per week or > participate; 2.

SB 1204 includes some exemptions for the work > requirement.‚Äù  Implementation  The proposition passed with 60.6% of the vote. However, was challenged in court in a lawsuit directly after the initiative was passed within the 2018 General Election. There has been one lawsuit in regards to Proposition 2, since it was approved through the 2018 General Election. This lawsuit was: Brent Regan v. Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney and was filed within the Idaho Supreme Court. The Plaintiff, Brent Regan, made the argument that through the passing of Proposition 2, the initiative violates the constitutional right of the state and the Medicaid expansion within Idaho delegates too much power to the Federal Government. This case was found to be ruled in favor of the Defendant, Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney. The court ruled that Regan's concerns were based within the hypothetical and the judiciary branch was not the appropriate mediary at this time. The courts stated within their case report conclusion section that the voting results have proven the voice of the people within the State and it is now within the hands of the legislative branch of government. The case that Regan has proposed is not a constitutional issue and has been brought to the attention of the courts prematurely.  Current status  Medicaid Expansion By State as of November 2018 Since the events of Proposition 2 being passed, there are currently 36 states in which Medicaid has been expanded within due to voter initiatives in each state. Within 2019, there are still 14 states which have not passed medicare expansion initiatives. Through the Medicaid expansion efforts it is reported to have increased yearly coverage for persons earning up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. The success of the campaign has been noted as an example of rural conservative voters voting for liberal measures.

The Fish and Wildlife Service immediately placed her in service in the waters of the Territory of Alaska, where she replaced the FWS vessel MV Brown Bear in making regular voyages to and from Bristol Bay, transporting supplies and personnel. On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress had assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes and other fur- bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF).AFSC Historical Corner: The Pribilof Islands Tender Vessels Retrieved September 4, 2018 The Fish and Wildlife Service had assumed these responsibilities when it replaced the Bureau of Fisheries on 30 June 1940.

In the summer of 1955, Dennis Winn hauled 200 tons of building material from Seattle to Saint Paul Island in the Pribilofs, supporting an ongoing construction program to further the development of the islands. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service underwent a major reorganization in which it was renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and a new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) was created which operated the USFWS‚Ä≤s fleet of seagoing ships. Dennis Winn thus came under the control of the BCF. During the late 1950s, she was stationed at Juneau, Alaska, from which she operated in support of BCF management and biological research activities. Later career Alaska became a U.S. state on 3 January 1959 and, as a condition of Alaska‚Ä≤s statehood, the USFWS transferred Dennis Winn to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in 1960. In the spring of 1961, the government of Alaska sold her at auction.

Produced by Casey Cannon and Metropoulos, the film is directed by Van Ling from a screenplay by Ling, Metropoulos, and Kevin Bernhardt. It stars Tania Raymonde, Jan Uddin, Raza Jaffrey, Patti LuPone, and Christopher Plummer. The film was released in the United States on March 1, 2019 by Round Hill Media.  Plot  The film is a story of an ill-fated romance between a young Greek village girl and a conflicted Turkish officer during the dawn of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire in 1821. Twenty-year-old Anna Christina (Tania Raymonde) is smitten by Colonel Tariq (Jan Uddin), a rising star in the Turkish army who has growing doubts about his countrymen's brutal methods of governance, and who had once spared her life on a cliff-top when she was a child. However, their budding romance brings tragedy to her family and her village. Swearing revenge against the Turks, Christina joins the Greek rebellion and inadvertently becomes a local symbol of the Greek resistance movement, inspiring her countrymen and attracting the ire of the Turks, who place a bounty on her head. Having believed that she could leave her feelings behind, Christina must face off against the man who still loves her and wants to keep her safe, but who has now been tasked with her capture. Their encounters and skirmishes inevitably lead to a tragic confrontation during a pivotal battle between the Greeks and Turks that will change the course of history.

The game production does its best with limited resources, thanks, in part, to an impressive supporting cast. Apart from Christopher Plummer, it boasts the likes of Patti Lupone, Kevin Corrigan, and Billy Zane in the ‚Äî shall we say ‚Äî Billy Zane role: the smarmy, traitorous Greek collaborator with an eye for Anna Christina; one half-expects him to declare, ‚ÄúI make my own luck!‚Äù The dialogue is often stiff, the action and plotting unlikely, making the romance hard to swallow.

Early private career Mijiƒá was born to a wealthy family in the area of Sombor, Vojvodina. He was educated as an agronomist and was an entrepreneur in the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), working in the export of cereals.Fred Hiatt, \\"Until They Get Democracy\\" [editorial], Washington Post, 3 February 1997, A17.Sne≈æana ƒåongradin, \\"Kontroverzni naslednik\\", Danas, 6 April 2011, accessed 10 September 2018. Publisher =Editorial stance and relations with state authorities= Borba, formerly the official gazette of the Yugoslav Communist Party, became a limited company in 1991; the government continued to own seventeen per cent of its shares. Mijiƒá's became the paper's director and main shareholder, and the paper pursued an editorial line critical of the Serbian government. In November 1994, a civil tribunal rejected Mijiƒá's efforts to register the paper as a private business and declared its 1991 agreement with the Yugoslavian government to be null and void. Following this decision, the Serbian government initiated a campaign against the paper's independent political stance; Mijiƒá charged this was part of a more general campaign by Milo≈°eviƒá against independent media in Serbia. Mijiƒá was quoted as saying, \\"The intention is clear: behind the judicial machinations lies a plan to liquidate the independent Borba.\\"\\"Serbian court ruling threatens newspaper's anti- government stance,\\" Agence France-Presse, 13 November 1994. The following month, state authorities appointed Yugoslavian information minister Dragutin Brƒçin as the paper's director. This led to a split within the paper, in which the more numerous \\"rebel\\" group resigned to start a new paper called Na≈°a borba. The new paper was overseen by the private company Fininvest, owned by Mijiƒá.Jovan Matiƒá, \\"Belgrade newspaper defies state takeover bid,\\" Agence France-Presse, 30 December 1994. Mijiƒá gave an interview to the Washington Post in January 1997, in which he described Na≈ùa borba as \\"the only source of independent news [in Serbia] outside the government and the opposition\\" and argued that it was emerging as a \\"political option\\" for Serbs hoping for opposition parties to take a clearer stance on human rights issues, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and relations with neighbouring countries. He added that the paper was facing ongoing internal sanctions, including a ban on purchasing local newsprint and using Belgrade printing presses.Nora Boustany, \\"Goodbye Peace Talks, Hello Billable Hours,\\" Washington Post, 31 January 1997, A18. Newly appointed Serbian information minister Radmila Milentijeviƒá criticized Mijiƒá's comments the following month, saying that it was \\"irresponsible to tell such an important paper that there is only one independent paper in Serbia,\\" and asking, \\"How do the owners of Blic, Svedok and other papers feel about that?\\"\\"New Information Minister Says Hard Tasks Lie Ahead,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Service: Central Europe & Balkans, 14 February 1997 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 2045 gmt 11 Feb 97).

Serbia's government passed a restrictive public information law in October 1998 that permitted the state to exercise greater authority over the country's newspapers.

In October 1995, the editorial board called a ten-day strike for better working conditions, progress on the reorganization of the company, and input on the appointment of the next editor-in-chief.

The paper returned to publication shortly thereafter. =End of Na≈°a borba= Na≈°a borba never returned to circulation after its October 1998 shutdown. Mijiƒá said that the paper could not continue operating at a loss. Some members of the editorial staff disagreed with this assessment, questioning his commitment to free journalism, charging that his oversight of the paper was non-transparent, and saying that certain large- scale expenses were not justified.Sne≈æana ƒåongradin, \\"Kontroverzni naslednik\\", Danas, 6 April 2011, accessed 10 September 2018.

History Originally, the site hosted a Vallombrosan monastery, with sustaining farms and a chapel to St Carpoforo. The general layout seems to reflect the cloisters of the former monastery. In a 19th-century description, it was called Villa Monasterolo.Ville e castelli d'Italia: Lombardia e laghi, second edition, by Luca Beltrami; Editors of Tecnografica, Milan, (1907), page 479-481. These were repurposed by Count Giuseppe Simonetta (died 1733) with construction of a lodge. The monastic church was formulated as a family chapel, refurbished in Baroque style with a polychrome marble altar. The villa was transferred from the Simonetta to the Castelbarco family by the late 18th-century, when Francesca Simonetta married Count Cesare Castelbarco. This count pursued renovation of the buildings and surrounding area, which had been used as a hunting lodge in the past. In 1804, he expanded and decorated reception rooms, doubled the size of the south wing with the construction of a limonaia or orangery. On the esplanade next to the terrace, he built two Empire-style palazzini used as museum and theater. The park with enhanced with benches and statuary. Between 1835 and 1837, Cesare's nephew, Carlo Castelbarco created in the basement a series of rooms with individual themes: Egyptian, Etruscan, Roman, Oceanic, and finely a room with a Renaissance or Raphaelesque theme. The rooms, often cave-like, were furnished with fountains with playful water jets and waterfalls. A guide from 1907 depicts in situ a Northern Italian sculpture collected by Carlo,Beltrami, page 480. now in the Cloisters collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Italian Medieval Sculpture of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cloisters, by Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Lisbeth Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Jack Soultanian; page 120-121.

Depending on personal preferences and economic status, Burmese weddings can be religious or secular, and extravagant or simple.  Traditions by ethnicity  A wedding procession, with the groom and bride dressed in traditional Bamar wedding costume, reminiscent of royal attire. = Bamar traditions = The wedding traditions of the Bamar people (Burmans), who comprise the majority of Myanmar's population, incorporate a number of rituals and practices. Wedding expenses are typically borne by the groom's family. Dowries are typically unheard of, and arranged marriage is not a custom of the Burmese. Traditional Burmese folklore considers love to be destiny, as the Hindu god Brahma writes one's destiny in love on a child's brow when he or she is six days old, called na hpuza (, lit. \\"destiny on the forehead\\"). Buddhist monks are not present to conduct the wedding and solemnise the marriage, as they are forbidden to officiate weddings, which are considered a worldly affair (lokiya). However, they may be invited to bless the newly wed couple and recite a protective paritta. Typically, the bride and groom arrange an almsgiving feast called mingala hsun (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·ÄÜ·ÄΩ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏) to monks the morning of the wedding. Traditionally, a marriage is recognised with or without a ceremony when the man's longyi (sarong) is seen hanging from a rail of the house or if the couple eats from the same plate. A more extravagant wedding requires months of preparation, including consultation with an astrologer in choosing the most auspicious date and time in accordance with the Burmese calendar. The traditional Burmese months of Tagu, Kason, Nayon, Thadingyut, Tazaungmon, and Tabodwe are considered auspicious for weddings. Weddings are traditionally avoided during the Buddhist lent, which lasts three months from July to October. Ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe. The groom's family formally asks the bride's family for their blessing by offering a receptacle of a green coconut with its stalk intact encircled by bunches of green bananas called ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe (·ÄÑ·Äæ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä°·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤). The wedding details are negotiated between the families. Some Bamar families invite a spirit medium to protect the couple under the care of the household nat (spirit). Also, a master of ceremonies (·Äò·Ä≠·Äû·Ä≠·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Äõ·Ä¨), typically a brahmin, consecrates the ceremony. More elaborate wedding receptions include entertainment from musicians, and the wedding is ended with a speech by a guest of higher social standing. In urban areas, wedding receptions tend to be held at hotels. In rural areas, wedding pavilions are temporarily erected to host the festivities. Gift-giving is an important element of Bamar weddings. A traditional Bamar wedding ceremony is divided into seven chapters, namely: #Introduction or Pa·πáƒÅma (·Äï·Äè·Ä¨·Äô·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Invoking the Buddha (·Äò·ÄØ·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äï·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) #Gadaw of the Five Infinite Venerables (·Ä°·Äî·Äî·Äπ·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä´·Ä∏·Äï·Ä´·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Principal Consecration Rites (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äï·Äº·ÄØ·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏, ·Äï·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Veneration of the Devas (·Äí·Ä±·Äù·Ä´·Äï·Ä∞·Äá·Äî·Ä≠·Äö·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Admonishments (·ÄÜ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äô·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Closing (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Äû·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äî·Ä≠·ÄÇ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) Throughout the ceremony, the bride and groom sit on cushions next to each other. At the beginning of the wedding, the Brahmin blows a conch shell to commence the ceremony. Offerings of ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe, and six ceremonial trays containing rice, popcorn, grated betel nut and coconut, jasmine flowers, and red and white steamed glutinous rice cakes and 7 fried whole fish, are prepared for the ceremony. The couple pays obeisance to the Buddha, spirits and parents, holding a bouquet of eugenia sprigs and flowers chosen according to the birthdays of the couple. The master of ceremony joins the palms of the couple, wraps them in white cloth, and dips the joined palms in a silver or gold bowl. The Burmese word \\"to marry\\" is let htat (), which literally means \\"to join palms together.\\" After chanting a few Sanskrit mantras, the brahmin takes the couple's joined palms out of the bowl and blows the conch shell to end the ceremony. The wedding processional at the beginning of the wedding ceremony is accompanied by a bwe song called \\"Aura of Immeasurable Auspiciousness\\" (·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äû·Ä≠·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äû·Äº·Äò·Ä¨·Äò·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑, Ataing Mathi Mingala Awba Bwe), which is drawn from MahƒÅgƒ´ta, the corpus of classical Burmese songs, and sung to the tune of a Burmese harp (saung). The aforementioned song is analogous to the \\"Bridal Chorus\\" used in Western weddings. The style of MahƒÅgƒ´ta songs has also been adapted in more modern compositions, such as \\"Auspicious Song\\" (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äê·Ä±·Ä∏, Mingala Tei) composed by Twante Thein Tan, and \\"Akadaw Pei\\" (·Ä°·ÄÅ·Ä´·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏) by Waing Lamin Aung, both of which are commonly played at traditional Burmese weddings. There are ten commonly observed Bamar wedding rites: # Paso tan tin (·Äï·ÄØ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äê·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä∫) - The groom's family visits the bride's family bearing wedding gifts, including a new longyi. The bride remains in her bedroom during the exchange of gifts, while the groom remains at his home. Afterwards, the groom's longyi or shawl is hung on a clothesline in another room to serve as the newlywed's new room, signifying the marriage. # Let son sa (·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Ä∂·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏) - the couple eat a morsel of cooked rice or snack from the same dish. # The couple exchanges wedding rings. # The groom visits the home of the bride's parents with a new set of longyi. The bride's family then bathes the groom and helps him change into the new set of clothes. # A master of ceremony joins the right hands of the couple in front of the invitees to solemnize the marriage. # Dali phwe (·Äí·Ä´·Äú·ÄÆ·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑) - The couple lower their heads as a gold or silver alloy necklace chain (4 cubits in length) and flower garlands are jointly hung over them. # Sulya yitpat (·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Äê·Ä∫) - a white shawl called sulya (·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏), about 6 cubits long and 2 cubits wide, which is worn by the bride, is wrapped around the couple. # Pankon sut (·Äï·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄΩ·Äï·Ä∫) - the couple place floral garlands over each other. # The coupled place their right hands, joined at the palm, into glass or silver bowls filled halfway with water and sprigs of Eugenia (·Äû·Äï·Äº·Ä±) and blades of Saccharum grass (·Äî·Ä±·Äá·Ä¨·Äô·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä∫), signifying the establishment of a long lasting marriage. Their hands are wrapped with white cloth, over which perfumed water from a conch or ceremonial vessel, is poured. # The master of ceremony consecrates the wedded couple by dipping springs of Eugenia leaves into a gold or silver bowl and sprinkling the couple's foreheads with perfumed water. = Mon traditions = The Mon people have a number of unique wedding traditions. The groom's family traditionally bears the wedding costs. The wedding itself is preceded by an engagement ceremony, in which 5 elders from the bride's family host 5 set of parents from the groom's family to negotiate the financial terms of the marriage, including a dowry. The parties also negotiate the details of the wedding ceremony, including the food to be served and the date. The Mon exclusively wed during the Burmese months of Tazaungmon and Tabaung. After the wedding details are finalized, young virgins are dispatched to invite wedding attendees in nearby areas, bearing wedding cards and gifts of Betel Nut or lahpet (pickled tea leaves). In the lead-up to the wedding, the bride's family home, which serves as the ceremonial venue, is decorated. On the eve of the wedding, three virgins send gifts of pumpkin, coconut, papaya and khanom chin (vermicelli) to the bride's home, and the bride reciprocates the gifts with cigarettes. On the wedding day, the groom's family leads a procession to the bride's family home. The groom's eldest sister bears a gift basket containing a coconut sapling, areca palm, area nuts, betel leaves, pickled tea leaves, and household items including pepper, onion, rice, oil, and salt, while the youngest daughters carry lacquerware to the venue. Both the bride and groom are splashed with water using Eugenia leaves. The wedding ceremony continues with an exchange of gifts. Following the ceremony, the newlywed couple spend 7 days in each other's family homes. = Rakhine traditions = The Rakhine people practice a wedding ceremony called thamet tet pwe (·Äû·Äô·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤), literally \\"ceremony of the son-in-law's ascent\\". The groom dons a taungshay paso and gaung baung, while the bride wears an outfit including a htaingmathein jacket embroidered with celestial beings, birds, and a lion. A wedding table is set for the ceremony, sprinkled with paddy seeds and silver coins symbolizing prosperity and fertility. A platter of steamed sticky rice, signifying the couple's unity, is placed on the table. Atop the sticky rice are a pair of cooked prawns, fried whole fish, boiled duck eggs and sweet potatoes. The couple then don ceremonial wedding headdresses (·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äû·Äª·Äæ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫). Holy thread is then encircled and tied around the wedding table nine times. The couple partake in offering morsels of food to their parents. Then, the bride and groom take off their headdresses. The groom places his headdress on the bride's head, solemnizing the wedding. = Chin traditions = The Chin people have a wide-ranging number of wedding traditions. The engagement is initiated by the groom's parents, who gift a bottle of alcohol to the bride's family in a rite called zuthawl pia. After negotiating the wedding details, ta mopina ceremony is held to take the bride from her family home. The families haggle and exchange cash, and the bride's family equips their daughter with a basket, blanket, mattock, axe, and bottle (or in modern times, money and jewels). The introduction of Christianity has displaced some traditional Chin rites. Among the Asho Chin, shaman called pasung saya officiate and organize traditional wedding ceremonies. In a significant wedding rite, a pig is slaughtered at dawn and its liver is extracted for examination. The pasung saya examines the liver to read the couple's future as a married couple.

Early life James was born in London, and landed in Australia on his eighth birthday. His parents was Richard (Jimmy) Haughton James (designer and painter) and Charlotte (Terry) Stevens. He is an Australian architect who turned to the study of Early Gothic architecture and sculpture, and in particular the cathedral of Chartres. At the same time James studied psychotherapy and practiced for 30 years while writing and publishing on medieval architecture. James entered the University of Melbourne in 1949 to study Architecture under Prof Brian Lewis, and was accorded a degree with honors in 1953. His instructors included leading Modernist Roy Grounds, Robin Boyd, Frederick Romberg and Fritz Janeba. He also completed a three-year sub- major in Art History under Prof. Joseph Burke, under whom he surveyed the Melbourne terrace house and its cast-iron tracery, now held in the Dixon Library, Sydney. He was inspired by Geoffrey Serle to investigate the New Guard, the Sydney fascist movement set up to remove the Lang Labor government in the 1930s. James married Hilary Kelly and they have three children. After working in England, Sweden, Italy and British West Africa, the couple returned to Australia. James received a Master of Building Science under Prof Cowan at Sydney University in 1966, with a thesis on site control on large buildings, and in 1988 he gained a PhD in medieval architecture from the University of NSW, which was published as The Template-makers of the Paris Basin.  Architectural practice  James founded his architectural practice in Sydney (1957-1971) where he was part of the Sydney School in domestic architecture,Jennifer Taylor. ‚ÄòThe Sydney School‚Äô, An Australian Identity, University of Sydney Press, 1972 akin to the California redwood houses early last century. He became the first builder-architect to be certified by the Australian Institute of Architects in 1958. He designed over 200 houses and is best known for the Readers Digest head office (1962‚Äì67) in Sydney with a significant roof garden that won many awards. The building is now a protected National Heritage Monument, and considered part of the Brutalist movement in Australia. James was in partnership with Ross Yuncken from 1959 and as well with Peru Perumal from 1968. James' experience in both construction and design spurred his interest in the role of the master mason in medieval European building. While running his architectural practice he taught the history of medieval architecture and studio design at Sydney Technical College and at the Universities of Sydney and New South Wales (1966-2007). In 2008 James was recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for ‚ÄúService to architecture as a practitioner, educator and historian, particularly as a leading scholar on French Gothic architectural history‚Äù. A little earlier he had received the American Institute of Architects Honour for Collaborative Achievement, for his work on French Gothic architecture (2005), and in 2018 the Australian Institute of Architects Enduring Architecture award for the Readers Digest building.  The Contractors of Chartres Controversy  In 1969 he traveled to France to examine the construction history of Chartres cathedral, to see if the art-historical theories could be reconciled with the evidence in the masonry, and quickly found that the theories current at that time were incorrect. He continued this investigation at Chartres for five years, and developed the investigative technique he termed ‚ÄúToichology‚Äù.John James, \\"In defence of Toichology\\", Avista Forum, vii 1994, 9. His first article on this research was published by Dennis Sharp in the Architecture Association Quarterly in 1972, which led to Robert Branner's assessment on what this approach could offer to scholarship.Robert Branner, \\"Gothic architecture\\", Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, xxxii 1973, 327-333. James showed how the cathedral had been built from the evidence in the masonry, and in the process redefined the constructional history of the building and presented a new view of early medieval building practice. He identified the nine master masons and analyzed their geometric methods. The monograph was published in two volumes in English, and three in French translated by local architect Dominique Maunoury. The major discoveries that caused controversy were:- * The cathedral was built in tilted, almost annual, layers, each layer being the work of a different master mason, some of whom returned from time to time. * The nave and the choir were built at the same time, not one after the other, and with the transepts and their porches, which were not added later. * That geometry ruled every design decision, including the initial geometry in setting out, and the bent axis was deliberate from the beginning. * The Royal Portal was not moved, but was erected where it is today with the western towers. * The apogee of Gothic sculpture should therefore be dated to the reign of Phillipe Auguste, and not Saint Louis, that is, some two decades earlier. In his study of Chartres he used his building experience and drafting ability to produce over 300 measured drawings to demonstrate not only the history of the cathedral, but to construct an investigative technique for medieval architecture. His work is akin to that of the French arch√©ologues who focus on archaeological analysis, a group including Arnold Wolff, Richard Hamman-MacLean and Jan van der Meulen. Their work commonly appeared in the monograph form, a \\"congenial vehicle for exercising the most precise and detailed examination of a great church's fabric\\".Crossley, Paul. \\"The Monograph.\\" [sect xvi of] \\"Introduction: Frankl's Text: Its Achievement and Significance.\\" Frankl, Paul and Crossley, Paul. Gothic Architecture. 2nd ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000, p. 24, 26 James determined that permanent architects did not exist for most Gothic churches before 1240, but that nearly all ecclesiastical buildings were constructed by bands of contractors who moved from site to site with their workforce. It was a major revision to the accepted opinion that discontinuous contracting was the norm. Though James had received a three-year training in Art History and was a skilled architect/builder for thirteen years, his views came up against the established canons of the profession. Some historians have still not accepted the thesis, though it has been obvious to professional architects. Some termed his views \\"eccentric\\", or \\"unusual\\", principally Steven Murray and Lon Shelby, was mainly based on theoretical grounds, without any re-examination of the evidence in the structure itself. Through the discussions that followed, James recognized the greater complexity of the medieval building scene. Yet, as all his later work shows, he remains firmly convinced that builders, like carvers, were peripatetic, and that at least before the mid-thirteenth century design control was not held by a single permanent master. James' demotion of the architect as prime designer may have inadvertently been driven by the popular \\"death of the artist\\" notion among art historians of the 1970's and 1980's. To gain a deeper appreciation of the medieval experience, he took his family on the pilgrimage route from Chartres to Compostella (walking over 400 kilometers) in 1973.Hilary James, On the Road, Brogo, 2017 From 1977 James presented his findings at lectures at over 70 universities and colleges in the US, France, England and Australia, including Oxford, Harvard, Princeton and Berkeley. From these lectures he wrote a more popular history of Chartres. He hoped to repeat this approach on the cathedral of Durham,John James, \\"The rib vaults of Durham cathedral\\", Gesta, xxii 1983, 135-145. Southwell Minster, and a group of key buildings in France associated with Chartres, in particular Saint-Denis-en-FranceJohn James, \\"Multiple contracting in the Saint-Denis chevet\\", Gesta, xxxxii 1993, 42-62 and Notre-Dame-du-Fort in Etampes. Appointed to various teaching and research posts at a dozen universities.  Creation of Gothic Architecture Project In the 1980s James sought out other work by the masons he identified at Chartres. This led him to undertake a three-year Survey of Early Gothic churches in northern France, and discovered that before the 1220s they were restricted to the Lutetian limestone region around Paris. At the time, less than one quarter of the churches with Early Gothic work had been studied, or even listed. After visiting more than 3,500 churches he inventoried over 1500 in the Paris area from the 1050-1250 period. The Survey was published in 1984. The fundamental difficulty in medieval studies is imprecise chronology. With only a few buildings having firmly documented dates, and then for only parts, medieval studies have lacked the basis for detailed historic analysis, unlike the contemporary Italian Renaissance. James' first approach was to use the profiles and design of elements, and construction strategies to identify the master masons, and to use that as a basis for a chronology, but he finally realized this approach would not be effective. The analysis of building methods and strategies was published as The Template-makers of the Paris Basin in 1989.John James, The Template-makers of the Paris Basin, Leura, 1989 It explains the investigative possibilities of Toichology and affirmed his conclusion from the Chartres study that churches, even the major ones, were built in many small campaigns, each directed by different masters. James has photographed and catalogued over 40,000 of the carved capitals from this period. James realized that changing style, or fashion, in carving could be the key to dating, and hence to the possibility of a more detailed history of early Gothic architecture and sculpture. This showed there were specific moments of stylistic change brought about by the Crusades and in the 1170s a dramatic redefinition of the carved capitals. These formed distinct boundaries in medieval culture that may be used to frame a chronology. The first flying buttresses were thought to date from the 1180s, but using these techniques James argued that this invention should be moved back thirty years.and similarly with the pointed arch and the earliest rib vaults. James has avoided permanent academic appointments to concentrate on this research as an independent scholar, enabled by various grants that have come mainly from the Australian Research Council. in spite of papers offered at conferences in the US, UK and France, the lack of students has tended to isolate his work from the mainstream trends of Art History. The most recent is the first five volumes of an intended nine-volume Thesaurus of French Early Gothic architecture. These five, containing photographs of nearly all the carved capitals in the region before 1250, were published between 2002 and 2008, with the shortened title of The Ark of God. The other four volumes were intended to focus on chronology, inventions, rib vaults, the portals and a reconsideration of the history of the Gothic style, but were abandoned due to the dramatic decline in academic library acquisitions. The construction analysis and the indexed capitals have been placed online, with over 30,000 images. The books themselves were self-published by West Grinstead Pty Ltd, a company he setup to print and distribute academic books. James used a connoisseurship approach akin to [Giovanni Morelli]'s to identify over 200 of the individual carvers before 1180, and 20 draft papers were made available online as the Master Carvers Series (2010-2014). Forty of his essays have been collected into one volume In Search of the Unknown in Medieval Architecture. From the capitals study, and especially that on the 263 carvings in the Laon cathedral gallery (ca.1163) James' analysis has redefined the carvers roles and professional relationships, some travel patterns and what appears to be Rites of Passage from Journeyman to Master.Master Carver Series on http://johnjames.com.au, numbers 19, 20 and 23.  Therapist, as teacher and practitioner  From 1983 James and his wife Hilary studied psychology, both professionally and personally, under a number of teachers, in particular Bhakti Carrisbrooke and [Hal Stone]. They concentrated on Sandplay and created new dynamic techniques that are more Jungian than Freudian. James condensed this into a short book, Notes to Transformation. In 1996 the James's founded The Crucible Centre on a 260 acre property in the Blue Mountains for teaching therapy techniques to students. Three years later James created the first tertiary-accredited Post-Graduate Diploma course in Transpersonal Psychotherapy, from which he wrote The Great Field. After two bushfires the Centre was closed in 2016 and, with Hilary, James moved to Brogo on the Australian South Coast.  Environmental activism  Starting with a talk he gave on environmental pollution in Seattle in 1980, James has tried to help people understand the science of Global Warming. Besides many lectures, he formed the Crisis Coalition in 2006, and the Eco Platform in 2015, each with their own websites. He edits a weekly email Newsletter and has often been called to talk on public radio in Australia, the UK and the US.

The play was first published in pamphlet form in 1926 but became more widely known through its subsequent publication in Hemingway's 1927 short story collection, Men Without Women. The play is a representation of the aftermath of the crucifixion of Jesus, in the form of a conversation between three Roman Soldiers and a Hebrew bartender. There is no record of the play having been performed. It is one of the few dramatic works written by Hemingway.  Background  Pauline in 1927, around the time of the publication of Men Without Women. There is little published content discussing the original publication of Today is Friday. George Monteiro simply describes the play as being published in a short story pamphlet by The As Stable Productions, nevertheless, it was both written and published twice during Hemingway's years living as an expatriate in Paris. Beginning in the early 1920s, Hemingway lived in Paris with his first wife, Hadley Richardson, working as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Following the publication of The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway's divorce from Richardson was finalized. Jeffrey Meyers notes that the divorce prompted Hemingway to convert to Catholicism, which may have influenced the inclusion of Today is Friday in Men Without Women. He subsequently married Pauline Pfeiffer and the two holidayed in Le Grau-du-Roi in the south of France. It was here that Hemingway continued planning his upcoming collection of short stories. John Beall states that Hemingway was actively involved in the planning of Men Without Women while he was still writing The Sun Also Rises, and thus, it was in the South of France that he continued this work. At this point, Hemingway was living comfortably, owing to both Pfeiffer's large trust fund as well as Hemingway's growing income as a writer. Men Without Women was published on October 14th shortly before Hemingway and Pfeiffer moved back to the United States, making the short story collection the last work published in Hemingway's Paris years. Despite seeming so, Today is Friday is not Hemingway's first attempt at writing a piece of drama, having written a piece named No Worst Than a Bad Cold as a teenager.  Plot summary  Three Roman soldiers described as \\"a little cock-eyed\\" drink red wine in a \\"drinking place\\" in the aftermath of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. They are in the company of only a Hebrew bartender named George. The first soldier orders more wine from George. The third soldier leans on a barrel in pain, complaining of a gut ache which has rendered him unable to continue drinking. George mixes a drink to fix the third soldier's gut ache. The third soldier drinks the cup and exclaims, \\"Jesus Christ.\\" The three soldiers then converse about the crucifixion of Jesus they had witnessed earlier that day. The first soldier insists that \\"he was good in there today,\\" while the soldiers remark on which aspects of the crucifixions they enjoy or dislike. The third soldier continues to feel unwell. The first soldier asks the others if they \\"saw his girl,\\" which is implied to be Mary Magdalene. The second soldier replies that he \\"knew her before he did,\\" further implying he used her services as a prostitute before she became a follower of Jesus. The soldiers continue to talk about the crucifixion, where the first soldier admits that he stabbed Jesus with a spear while he was on the cross, insisting it was \\"the least I could do for him.\\" The three soldiers get up to leave. The second soldier tells George to add the price of the wine to his tab, refusing to pay George an advance sum reasoning that payday is on Wednesdays. Outside on the street, the second soldier refers to George with an anti-semitic term to which the third soldier continues to complain about his painful stomach.  Writing style  Hemingway's prose has been extensively analysed for its minimalistic style, which came to be known as the Iceberg theory of omission. According to Meyers, a respected biographer of Hemingway, Hemingway believed the quality of an author's work is assessable by the respective quality of the words eliminated. Furthermore, Meyers asserts that because of Hemingway's mastery of omission in this way, he then went on to become the \\"most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century.\\" Robert Lamb observes that while Hemingway's prose has been 'exhaustively analysed', his specific use of dialogue has also made an equally significant impact on modern literature: > During a period of three and a half years, [Hemingway] completely altered > the function and technique of fictional dialogue and presented it as one of > his many legacies to twentieth-century literature. Hemingway's 'deceptively simplistic' dialogue is, due to the genre of the work, central to the piece. The modernity of the language and the use of American slang used by the soldiers is particularly salient given the time and setting of the play. Indeed, as Ali Zaidi comments, the soldier's dialogue is completely anachronistic. While such clearly anachronistic dialogue may detract from the historical accuracy of the piece, it works to reveal the casual, irreverent attitude the soldiers have towards Jesus. Clancy Sigal commented on the style of the conversation between the soldiers as being 'casual sports-game like' and thus rendering the piece to become 'all the more vivid' to modern audiences. Hemingway's ability as a playwright has been often, and understandably overlooked in the field of literary criticism. Moreover, he has rarely, if ever been referred to as a playwright, owing to his prolific career as a novelist and short story writer. Thus Today is Friday occupies a unique position in the Hemingway catalogue as a rare insight into the writer's vision of Christianity and playwriting.  Analysis  Arguably the most striking aspects of the play are both the characterization of Christ, the modern Americanized language used by the soldiers and the Hebrew bartender, and the play within a play formula utilized by Hemingway. Christopher Dick argues that most critics, aside from inaccurately identifying the genre of Today is Friday as a short story, also fail to notice Hemingway's \\"use of the dramatic as the controlling metaphor in the text.\\" Critics often interpret the repeated line, \\"He did good in there today,\\" as the soldiers' apparent treatment of the crucifixion as a boxing match. An example of such a critic is Paul Smith, who insists that the conversation between the soldiers: \\"treats the 'main event' of Christianity as just that... a prizefight...\\" Indeed, such a comparison, that of the crucifixion to the sport of boxing, as Flora describes, reinforces the notion of the \\"muscular Jesus.\\" Dick, in his essay, Drama as Metaphor in Ernest Hemingway's 'Today is Friday' , continues his argument that drama as a concept is the salient metaphor in the play. He quotes the lines: \\"That's not his play,\\" and \\"I was surprised how he acted,\\" as evidence of Hemingway's play within a play metaphor. Despite Dick's assertion that the boxing metaphor is ancillary to the play within a play metaphor, it is nevertheless consistent with Hemingway's continued reference to the sport within his writing. In fact, Today is Friday was not the only story within Men Without Women to reference boxing, the story, Fifty Grand is explicitly about a boxer training for a prizefight. Hemingway's apparent obsession with boxing is documented in multiple archived letters and he is widely quoted as having said, \\"my writing is nothing, my boxing is everything\\" whilst being interviewed by Josephine Herbst. The way in which Hemingway appreciated boxing is made ever more vivid through the way he characterized Christ as a gallant boxer in Today is Friday. Indeed, the play has been noted one of the author's clearest indications of his love for the sport in this regard. In his book, The Hemingway Short Story: a critical appreciation, George Monteiro describes the way in which Jesus is presented in the text: > Not yet suffused with historical Christianity, mythology or legendry, Jesus > emerges in the eyes of some of the Romans, not as an outlaw or a man > obsessed by a vision, but as a courageous performer under extreme duress. Despite Monteiro's assertion that Jesus (in the play) has not yet assumed mythological status, Ali Zaidi argues that the casual and laconic nature of the soldiers' dialogue reveals the inference that Jesus is in fact, 'about to assume mythic proportions.' Zaidi references a tongue-in-cheek remark from the third soldier to the Hebrew bartender: > Wine-seller ‚Äì You were in bad shape, Lootenant. I know what fixes up a bad > stomach. > [The third Roman soldier drinks the cup down.] > 3d Roman Soldier ‚Äì Jesus Christ. [He makes a face.] Whilst the soldier's remark may seem disingenuous or even banal, Hemingway clearly alludes to Jesus' supposed ability to heal sickness. This is a clear example of Hemingway's iceberg theory of omission, wherein only the necessary details are written, namely, the inference to Jesus' healing powers, without the need for an in depth explanation. Other critics have focused on Hemingway's potential motivation for his overtly masculine characterization of Jesus. Lisa Tyler suggests that Today is Friday is potentially a direct response to the book, The Man Nobody Knows by Bruce Barton, citing Hemingway and Barton's shared contempt for the common characterization of Jesus as 'wimpy'. Instead, Jesus is characterized as notably macho, through the repeated allusions to boxing and his resilience. Tyler insists Hemingway's characterization of Jesus in such a way is due to his belonging to the philosophical movement, Muscular Christianity.  Reception  Being one of Hemingway's lesser known works, Today is Friday has not been subject to much criticism, scholarly or otherwise. It has been treated as a \\"puzzling\\" work by Hemingway, lending mostly to the question of genre. Joseph M. Flora notes that this confusion spurs from the work being included in two of Hemingway's short story collections: Men Without Women and The Fifth Column and the First Forty- Nine Stories, thus treating it as a short story despite clearly being written in the form of a play. The most scolding criticism of the play came from Carlos Baker in his 1969 biography, Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story, where he described the play as 'tasteless'. While the play itself did not receive much, if any recognition at the time of publication, the collection it was published in, Men Without Women, did receive considerable attention. While some stories were subject to mixed reviews, Hemingway's modernist style was praised almost universally. Percy Hutchinson, in the New York Times Book Review wrote that his writing displayed \\"language sheered to the bone, colloquial language expended with the utmost frugality; but it is continuous and the effect is one of continuously gathering power.\\" References 1926 plays Works by Ernest Hemingway ","title":"Today is Friday"},{"id":"58455365","text":"Rosita Liao Gonzales (April 18, 1929 - August 11, 1994) was a Panamanian educator and folklorist.

Once the former St Kilda Lifesaving Club Captain, he is now the only Australian lifeguard to have worked both major migration routes in Europe. Simon first became part of a team of six on lesvos Greece with International Surf Lifesaving Association (ISLA). Since joining the mission with ISLA, Lewis has completed seven humanitarian rescue missions with six NGOs saving the lives of over 1,900 African and Syrian refugees as they attempted to cross the dangerous waters of the Mediterranean Sea to Greece and Italy. As well as being the first Australian to become the head of mission on the central migration route for the German NGO Mission Lifeline. Simon participated in the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) yearly telethon which raised over $800,000 for the organisation to continue to help those in dire need. Lewis became one of the most known, respected and awarded lifeguards with the search and rescue community globally.  Career  Lewis began his lifesaving career on St Kilda beach in Melbourne, Victoria, where he became the St Kilda Lifesaving Club Captain and now the Director. After seeing the photograph of three year-old Syrian boy, Aylan Kurdi, whose drowned body washed up in Turkey in 2015, he learned that the International Surf Lifesaving Association was looking for volunteers and applied. By 2016, Lewis's application was successful and he was on his way to volunteer with search and rescue in Lesbos, Greece. He stated in an interview in 2016 that his \\"only motivation is lifesaving\\". Lewis was also a part of the search and rescue team on board the MS Aquarius, a joint venture between SOS M√©diterran√©e and Doctors Without Borders. This mission helps to save the lives of refugees who attempt to cross the dangerous Mediterranean Sea. Lewis became head of mission on the MV Lifeline, funded by the German charity Mission Lifeline. In 2016, Lewis set up a rapid response group on the Greek island of Lesbos, pulling Syrian refugees from the water between Turkey and Greece. Volunteer work Since joining the International Surf Lifesaving Association in 2016, after working as a lifesaver on the beach of St Kilda in Australia, Lewis has volunteered his time and skills to help save the lives of over 1,400 African and Syrian refugees who attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Greece or Italy. In 2016, Lewis was a part of a six-man team who helped save 517 refugees, ranging for babies of six months old to 80-year-old adults. Lewis and his team also helped raise $22,600 via their GoFundMe page. Lewis will also continue his volunteer work to help refugees by being a part of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) Telethon on World Refugee Day. He will be one of thirty-three people taking donations over the phone in attempts to celebrate the strength and resilience of refugees and help raising funds to support refugees. Lewis's participation in the ASRC's yearly telethon helped raise over $800,000 for the organisation to continue to help those in dire need. Lewis helped Port Phillip Council to provide floating wheelchairs and special matting at St Kilda and Port Melbourne beaches under a $65,000 initiative. Lewis and the St Kilda Life Saving Club are responsible for rolling out the matting, allowing these beaches to become more accessible for people with disabilities. Lewis also ensured his skills would have a lasting influence on Greek lifeguards and international volunteers in Lesbos, as he helped train them in water safety protocols which they could put to use on future rescues. He also built a rapid jet ski response team that has since rescued hundreds of refugees. Refugee rescue  Lewis was a part of the International rescue mission that took place off the island of Lesbos in Greece. Before the mission started, Lewis and his team of six others helped raise $22,600 online. During this mission, the ISLA team saved 517 refugees lives as they attempted to cross dangerous waters to Italy and Greece. Although it is estimated that over 5000 died attempting this journey in 2016 alone, which each week thousands of refugees attempt to cross the tetras sea. Lewis admits that even 11 months after the mission took place that \\"Lesbos is still with me\\" after seeing the deaths of many refugees. Between 2015-2017, Lewis has helped save the lives of nearly 1,900 African and Syrian refugees as they have attempted to the cross the Mediterranean Sea to Greece and Italy. In late 2017, Lewis faced another difficult issue whilst stationed in the Mediterranean Sea, this time in the form of fake gold Chanel- branded \\"life jackets\\". These were sold for a high price by traffickers but were made with cheap foam and turn into dead weights when they hit the water. Lewis who was the Australian Head of Mission of NGO ship Lifeline, saw the fake Chanel life jackets first hand, as he pulled refugees from the Southern Mediterranean. He labelled them as \\"straitjackets\\" and stated \\"they (traffickers) don't care about lives, they're just herding cattle and making money off it.\\"  Recognition and achievements  In 2017, Lewis was nominated and became a finalist for Australian of the Year Victorian Local Hero award for helping to save more than 500 refugees lives in January 2016. Lewis also ensured his skills would leave a lasting imprint in Lesbos by training Greek lifeguards and international volunteers in water safety protocols to help with future rescues. He built a rapid jet ski response team that has since rescued hundreds of refugees. He was nominated alongside former AFL star, Neale Daniher who helped raise millions of dollars for MND research. He was awarded an International Life Saving Federation Citation of Merit in 2016. Lewis also joined the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, based in Malta during August 2017 and was contracted as the No. 1 lifeguard for three rotations until September 2017. He is also the first Australian head of mission on the central migration route for the German NGO Mission Lifeline. As well as being the first Australian lifeguard to have worked both the central and western Europe migration routes for refugees. Lewis was also selected by the City of Port Phillip Mayor, Bernadene Voss, as a local hero to be a baton bearer for the Queen's baton in the lead up to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC). He was the first Victorian to carry the Queen's baton on the relay route through the state of Victoria on 17 November 2017.

Ward is most remembered for his work as the head physician of the Batticotta Seminary where he served as a prominent educator and was influential in handling the cholera outbreak of 1846.  Early life and education  Nathan Ward was born on November 21, 1804, in Plymouth, New Hampshire. His mother was Sarah Ward and his father was Samuel Ward. He received his primary and secondary schooling in his birth town. Later, he attended Bowdoin College Medical School, the \\"Medical School of Maine\\" and graduated in 1832. After schooling, he moved to live in Vermont where he met his wife and later settled to have kids.  Personal life  Ward married Hannah Ward on January 8, 1833. They met in Vermont where Hannah was born. They lived in North Troy, Vermont for a couple of years before eventually settling in Burlington, Vermont. Nathan and Hannah Ward traveled to Ceylon together where the eventually conceived and raised all of their children. In 1834, the Wards had their first child William H. Ward. Later, they had their second son Edward C. Ward and in 1842 they had Samuel R. Ward. At some point in between the births of William and Samuel, the Wards also had a baby girl who passed away before turning one.  Missionary service  After graduating from medical school Ward worked as a physician. After a couple of years, he tired of this work and decided to pursue a calling to work abroad. Hannah Ward's brother was a missionary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (A.B.C.F.M). He helped Ward get involved with the program and, ultimately, get sent on a mission to Ceylon. Luckily for Ward, his timing could not have been better. A new governor of Jaffna had just been elected who permitted the presence of American missionaries while the previous governor had not. This resulted in a sudden increase in demand for missionaries, including Ward. = Journey = On June 30, 1833, Ward met the other voyagers that would be accompanying him on his journey to Ceylon, which included Reverend William Todd, Samuel Hutchins, Henry R. Hoisington, George H. Apthorp and their respective wives. The group received an embarkation ceremony in the Park-Street Church of Boston. Only July 1, 1833 they departed from Boston on a ship called the Israel. An audience of Bostonians accumulated to watch as a hymn was sung to grace the missionaries with good fortune on their journey. On October 28, 1833, the group arrived at the Jaffna Peninsula. = Service = Ward was only the second capable and qualified physician to be sent to the Batticotta Seminary and was, therefore, much needed and appreciated. The physician that was at the seminary before Ward was Dr. Scudder. After Ward arrived, he was able to open new stations in the peninsula and was eventually relocated to Madras in 1836. Scudder left Ward in charge of the seminary. He lived with other missionaries, Daniel Poor, Henry Woodward, James Read Eckard and their wives. At that point, Ward was the only American A.B.C.F.M physician in all of Jaffna. Scudder commented on some of the benefits of having Ward at the Batticotta Seminary. He explained how Ward helped keep the hospital regulated, train students, and engage in new fields of research. As well as a physician, Ward was a teacher of Natural Philosophy and Medicine at the school. Additionally, he worked with and helped train a group of 8-10 native men in medicine by having them shadow him and help him with tasks in the hospital. He was observed to treat his men with respect by referring to them as ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù in his letters. The most notable and trying aspect of Ward's mission was the cholera outbreak of 1846. Before Ward's arrival the natives did not understand how cholera is transmitted. They believed that simply being around a person with cholera would put someone at risk for getting the disease. In reality, the disease is transmitted through feces and often is common in places with poor sanitation. Ward helped educate the population while also providing medication. Many of the natives were opposed to taking medication, but Ward was able to treat around 900 patients and save around 600 people to give him a 60% success rate. = Return = After thirteen years of working in Ceylon under the A.B.C.F.M, the Wards finally returned to the states in the year 1846. Both Nathan and Hannah Ward had experienced deteriorations in their health and decided it was time to return to Vermont. For a time, Ward continued to work as a physician in Burlington, Vermont. Later in 1853, he decided to become a member of the clergy. He had been a member of the Browington Church for several years. Throughout his membership the Church had been lacking a pastor. Therefore, at the request of the Church, Ward obtained his preacher's license and later in 1855 was ordained as an evangelist.  Death  After about a decade in Vermont, Ward was again overcome by the calling of overseas missionary work. His health had improved since he left and so on October 30, 1860, Nathan and Hannah Ward departed on their second journey from Boston to Ceylon. Unfortunately, Ward was never able to make it back to Ceylon. On November 24, 1860, Ward died of a heart attack at sea. In a letter written by Hannah Ward she states that he died peacefully in his sleep. Hannah Ward continued on to Jaffna despite her husband's passing and worked there for five years before returning home. She later died in 1884.

A bimodality in the Kepler exoplanet population was first observed in 2013, and was noted as possibly confirming an emerging hypothesis that photoevaporation could drive atmospheric mass loss on close-in, low-mass planets. This would lead to a population of bare, rocky cores with smaller radii at small separations from their parent stars, and planets with thick hydrogen- and helium-dominated envelopes with larger radii at larger separations. The bimodality in the distribution was confirmed with higher- precision data in the California-Kepler Survey in 2017, which was shown to match the predictions of the photoevaporative mass-loss hypothesis later that year. Despite the implication of the word 'gap', the Fulton gap does not actually represent a range of radii completely absent from the observed exoplanet population, but rather a range of radii that appear to be relatively uncommon. As a result, 'valley' is often used in place of 'gap'. The specific term \\"Fulton gap\\" is named for Benjamin J. Fulton, whose doctoral thesis included precision radius measurements that confirmed the scarcity of planets between 1.5 and 2 Earth radii, for which he won the Robert J. Trumpler Award, although the existence of this radius gap had been noted along with its underlying mechanisms as early as 2012 and 2013.

The festival was a big part of why the band decided to reunite, as the band enjoyed performing together. The band would then hire Greg Minier (The Crucified) to record solos for the album, but then added former Deliverance member Glenn Rogers to perform on the album.

An English major at the University of Rangoon, she was the chair of the Department of Medicine of the Institute of Medicine, Mandalay from 1965 to 1984, and served as a consultant at the World Health Organization from 1985 to 1991. Her literary career began in 1996, spurred on by the HIV/AIDS crisis in the country. She published 11 books in Burmese and two in English. At the time of her death, the former professor was collaborating on an English language book on the history of medical education in the country. Most of her books dealt with public health and medicine. One notable exception was her last published book in 2013, Poetry for Me, a collection of her English language poetry, which she began working on after the death of her husband Dr. San Baw, a hip replacement pioneer, in 1984. Through her books and interviews, she advocated for more openness and transparency in the country, and spoke out about the regression of women's rights in Myanmar. In 2012, she founded a daycare center for elderly physicians in Yangon. Early life and education Myint Myint Khin was born on 15 December 1923 in Bassein (Pathein), in the Irrawaddy delta in British Burma.Stafford 2014: 24 The oldest of three siblings, she grew up in the nearby delta town of Henzada (Hinthada), before moving to Rangoon (Yangon) as a teenager. She was not yet 15 when she enrolled at the University of Rangoon in 1938Yan Pai 2014 to study English literature, and there she became \\"obsessed\\" by the works of poet John Donne. Abandoned University of Rangoon during World War II Faculty of Medicine of University of Rangoon; now University of Medicine 1, Yangon However, her studies were interrupted by the arrival of World War II in 1941. In a 2013 interview, she said that the war years were a time of \\"tremendous adversity\\" and \\"anguish\\" during which she lost her mother and brother, and her family lost their property.Zon Pann Pwint 2013 Her brother was killed by a bomb, and she had to go and retrieve her dead brother's body. Furthermore, the loss of property caused \\"fears and insecurities in the aftermath of World War II\\". Yet it was also the war that got her into medicine. With all the colleges in the country shut down, she enrolled at the only university level school opened during the Japanese occupation: the wartime medical school founded by Drs. Ba Than, S. Sen and Yin May in 1943.In (Kyu Kyu Swe 2009: 119), Myint Myint Khin wrote that she was one of the few students who enrolled at the wartime medical school \\"under the tutelage of Sayagyi U Ba Than\\". Per (Myint Swe 2014: 105‚Äì106), Drs. Ba Than, Sen, and Yin May were co-founders of the wartime medical and nursing schools. After the war, she completed her original major, receiving a BA in English literature in 1946, and then promptly continued her medical education at the just reopened Faculty of Medicine, graduating with an MBBS in 1950. Medical career =Early years= Though Myint Myint Khin got into medicine by happenstance, she excelled at it. After starting out as a staff physician (Civil Assistant Surgeon) at Rangoon General Hospital in 1950, she did her residency at the University of Pennsylvania medical school, and received an MD in 1955.Penn Medicine 2015 She graduated ahead of her husband San Baw, the medical school classmate she married in 1953 who received an MD and an MS in 1958, also from Penn Medicine.Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 513 Meanwhile, she finished her training abroad by getting her FRCP from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. =Mandalay years= Back in Burma, the couple was transferred to Mandalay in 1960. She was appointed Clinical Professor of Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of Mandalay University(Stafford 2014: 24) names the medical school as the Institute of Medicine, Mandalay in 1960 but per (Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 12), the medical school was then the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Mandalay until 1964. while San Baw became chief of orthopedic surgery at Mandalay General Hospital. In 1965, she was promoted to be the head of the Department of Medicine, becoming the first woman chair at the school.UMM Former Heads of Dept. of Medicine According to a 1967 BMJ article, she was the only female head of Department of Medicine in the country's three medical schools at the time.(Stafford 2014: 24) quoting a 1967 BMJ article says she was \\"the lone female professor of general medicine the three Burmese medical schools.\\" While Stafford and the BMJ are technically correct, she was not the only female department head of at the medical schools then. Professor Khin Si was chair of the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Institute of Medicine 1, Rangoon from 1959 to 1976. Per (Tin Naing Toe 2011), the first female department chair in Burma was Dr. Yin May, who was chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1946 to 1959. University of Medicine, Mandalay She was widely respected by her colleagues and her students. According to Prof. Myint Myint Aye, the retired head of the Department of Medicine at the Institute of Medicine, Mandalay (1987‚Äì1990), her elder colleague was \\"widely respected for her excellent lectures and informative clinical bedside teachings\\", and \\"she recruited young graduates with promising potential and built the strongest department of medicine in Burma which produced hundreds and thousands of doctors meeting the international standard. These doctors are now not only serving Burma, but all over the world.‚Äù She is remembered as an inspirational and \\"towering figure\\" by her students, who affectionately called her \\"Mummy Gyi\\" (\\"elder mummy\\"),Khin Mar Mar Kyi 2014 while Prof. Myint Myint Aye was known as \\"Mummy Lay\\" (\\"younger mummy\\".)Aye Aye Chit 2019 Myint Myint Khin's description of herself was harsher: a demanding professor who could come across as \\"aggressive\\" and \\"abrasive\\".Kyu Kyu Swe 2009: 119 She retired abruptly after the death of her husband of 31 years on 7 December 1984. Still in mourning, she was greeted with more bad news less than three months later. Their only son Myint Zan, who had returned from Los Angeles to see his dying father, was locked up in political detention without charge and trial by the BSPP government.(The Law Quadrangle 2018): According to Myint Zan, he became a persona non grata of the Burmese government after enrolling at the University of Michigan Law School without having received permission from the government, which subsequently revoked his passport. Unable to go anywhere else, he stayed in the US after law school, taking on menial jobs to survive as a stateless person before finally returning to see his dying father. He was placed in solitary confinement in the notorious Insein Prison, and given no contact with the outside world, including his mother.The Law Quadrangle 2018 =Career abroad= Now \\"mired in a deep personal crisis\\", Myint Myint Khin left the country. She first took up a post as a visiting professor of medicine at the National University of Malaysia. After a few months, she moved to New Delhi to become a consultant in the World Health Organization‚Äôs Southeast Asia regional office. She served for six years on the WHO panel of experts in health manpower development, before retiring in 1991. Literary career It was during the years abroad that she began writing English language poetry. In a 2013 interview, she said she began writing poetry \\"because I could not bear not to write them\\" as an outlet from her personal crises. Later, she was inspired to write more poetry after visiting Sri Lanka when she was struck by the country's natural beauty. She said that she kept her love for poetry a secret from everyone including her husband and son; she continued that given her no non-sense public persona, her students would have been surprised by her \\"sentimental and emotive\\" side. At any rate, her first published book came amidst the HIV/AIDS crisis in Myanmar. (She had written for the Myanmar Medical Journal, and developed handbooks and audio tapes as study aids for medical students.) In 1996, she published The Bells Tolling for Everyone, which calls attention to the menace of HIV/AIDS on the country.Irrawaddy 2004 Frustrated by the dismissive attitude of the officials, and the low reported percentage of HIV infections in the country, she called for an expansion of general health education with \\"openness and transparency\\". To her, \\"the beginning of secrecy is the end of the truth.\\" She followed up with books on topics such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease as well as her vision on the development of medicine in the country. It was only in 2013 that the then 89-year-old former English major published her first English poetry book Poetry for Me. Her poetry often focused on her late husband. One such example is as follows: But close to my heart is a treasure trove, To draw upon if I chose Happiness shared, joys that glow And tenderness, I only know It turned out to be her last published book. In all, between 1996 and 2013, she published 11 books in Burmese and two in English. At her time of death, she was working on an English language book A History of Medical Education in Burma in collaboration with other physicians to tell the history of medical education in Myanmar from the colonial period to the present. Activism Myint Myint Khin maintained an active life until the last four months of her life. She also continued to voice her opinions strongly. According to Thane- Oke Kyaw Myint, a retired paediatrician and founder of the Alumni Myanmar Institutes of Medicine Association (AMIMA), \\"she had openly written articles in the newspapers on what was wrong with educational systems in Burma, never hesitating to openly criticise the present and the past governments, a stand that very few of us could or dare to do so publicly\\". For example, in 2004, she gave an interview to The Irrawaddy, then an exile run media outlet, in which she, quoting Orwell, highlighted the general lack of openness and transparency in the country as the root of many of its problems. She also spoke out about women's rights. She bemoaned the \\"truly backward\\" state of women's rights under the military regimes, away from the traditional Burmese culture. She wrote about the importance of general education, particularly literacy among women, for example to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis. She maintained that \\"The literacy rate among women influences a household‚Äôs health and even life style. You ought to invest in women.\\" She was a member of the Myanmar Medical Association, and once served as president of the Mandalay chapter, and twice on its board. In 2012, in association with the MMA and the Myint Myint Khin Foundation, she founded \\"Support Group for Elderly Doctors\\", which began operating a daycare center for elderly physicians in Tamwe Township, Yangon. Funded by the donations and free services of other physicians, many of whom were her former students, the center provided a place for elder physicians aged 70 and over, not all of whom were well off financially, to socialize as well as receive free medical checkups.Myo Lwin and Lun Min Maung 2014 Personal life Myint Myint Khin was married to her medical school classmate San Baw from 1953 to his death in 1984. As chief of orthopedic surgery at Mandalay General Hospital, San Baw \\"pioneered the use of ivory hip prostheses to replace ununited fractures of the neck of the femur.\\"(Khin Thet Hta et al 2005: 513): Professor Dr. San Baw (29 June 1922 ‚Äì 7 December 1984), son of Thaw Zan and Si Si, born in Tapun, Tharrawaddy. University of Rangoon (MBBS), University of Pennsylvania (MS). Chief orthopedic surgeon, Mandalay General Hospital. Their only child Myint Zan is a former professor of law, who taught at universities in Malaysia, Australia, the South Pacific and the United States from 1989 to 2016.Myint Zan 2019 Death Myint Myint Khin died on 19 June 2014 in Yangon. She had been receiving treatment for heart and kidney failures during the past four months. She was 90.As seen in (Yan Pai 2014), her age at death is reported as 91 in Myanmar, using Burmese age reckoning‚Äîi.e. she was in her 91st year.

The term has a more specialized sense as a literary device distinct to modernist fiction.Morris, Beja. Epiphany in the Modern Novel (1916). London: Peter Owen, 1971. Author James Joyce first borrowed the religious term \\"Epiphany\\" and adopted it into a profane literary context in Stephen Hero (1904-1906), an early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In that manuscript, Stephen Daedalus defines epiphany as \\"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself.\\"Joyce, James. Stephen Hero. (Ed. Theodore Spencer. New York: New Directions, 1963) p.211. Stephen's epiphanies are moments of heightened poetic perception in the trivial aspects of everyday Dublin life, non- religious and non-mystical in nature. They become the basis of Stephen's theory of aesthetic perception as well as his writing. In similar terms, Joyce experimented with epiphany throughout his career, from the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which were central to his early work, to his late novel Finnegans Wake (1939). Scholars used Joyce's term to describe a common feature of the modernist novel, with authors as varied as Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, and Katherine Mansfield all featuring these sudden moments of vision as an aspect of the contemporary mind. Joycean or modernist epiphany has its roots in nineteenth-century lyric poetry, especially the Wordsworthian \\"spots of time,\\"See Beja. Also Abrams, M.H. Natural Supernaturalism: Tradition and Revolution in Romantic Literature. New York: Norton, 1971; and Nichols, Ashton. The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Movement. Tuscalossa: U. of Alabama P., 1987. as well as the sudden spiritual insights that formed the basis of traditional spiritual autobiography.Kim, Sharon. Literary Epiphany in the Novel, 1850-1950: Constellations of the Soul. NY: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Philosopher Charles Taylor explains the rise of epiphany in modernist art as a reaction against the rise of a ‚Äúcommercial-industrial-capitalist society‚Äù during the early twentieth century.Taylor, Charles. Sources of the Self. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1989) 422.  Etymology  The word \\"epiphany\\" descends from the ancient Greek ·ºêœÄ·øêœÜ·æ∞ÃÅŒΩŒµŒπ·æ∞ (epiph√°neia), meaning a \\"manifestation or appearance.\\" The word is built from the Greek words \\"pha\\" (to shine), \\"phanein\\" (to show, to cause to shine), and \\"epiphanein\\" (to manifest, to bring to light).Skeat, Rev. Walter W. An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1910. In ancient Greek usage, the term often describes the visible manifestation of a god or goddess to mortal eyes, a form of theophany.Platt, Verity. Facing the Gods: Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. Early Christians adopted the term to describe the manifestation of the child Jesus to the Magi, which was understood figuratively as the revelation of Christ to the Gentiles and commemorated in the Catholic Feast of Epiphany, celebrated January 6. In the Greek New Testament manuscripts, epiphaneia refers also to Christ's second coming.  Epiphanies in Dubliners  Dubliners by James Joyce is a collection of short stories published in June, 1914. The short stories capture some of Joyce's most unhappy moments in life, which he connects to the city of Dublin. Dublin, to Joyce, seemed to be the centre of paralysis, which he explains in a letter to Grant Richards, who was the publisher of Dubliners. Joyce explains his purpose and intention behind writing the novel: > \\"My intention was to write a chapter of the moral history of my country and > I chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to me the centre of > paralysis. I have tried to present it to the indifferent public under four > of its aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life. The > stories are arranged in this order. I have written it for the most part in a > style of scrupulous meanness and with the conviction that he is a very bold > man who dares to alter in the presentment, still more to deform, whatever he > has seen and heard.\\" Epiphanies are a main literary device employed within the fifteen short stories in Dubliners and tend to circulate around moments of realisation of despair and disillusionment. Epiphanies employed by Joyce are often described as \\"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind ‚Äî the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it.\\"Beja p.18. The epiphanies in Dubliners in particular follow a common theme of loss and regret that are intertwined with death and despair that emerge from Joyce's very own childhood in Ireland. Epiphanies as a structural tool in Dubliners helps bring the narrative to a climax as the epiphany is formed throughout the story through the protagonists pain and reflection upon their experiences. = Araby = Araby is the third short story in Dubliners that centres around the narrator recollecting on an experience of when he was a young boy where he experienced a moment of epiphanic disillusionment. The story narrates in first person a young boy who is infatuated with a girl who remains unnamed and is referred to as, \\"Mangan's sister.\\" All quotations from Dubliners are from this source. The narrator is infatuated with her even though he has never truly spoken to her, yet he claims that her name was, \\"like a summons to all my foolish blood.\\" When the narrator learns of how Mangan's sister wishes to go to Araby, which is a bazaar that she cannot go to due to other religious obligations the narrator believes that if he can bring her back a gift that she would return his feelings. However, when the time came to go to the bazaar the narrator is delayed because he needs his uncle to lend him some money although the uncle forgot about it and so the narrator heads out late to the bazaar. Upon arrival to the bazaar, most of the stalls are closed as he is late. The narrator is confronted by what he is seeing in front of him and he turns away from Araby after his vision and expectations of it are destroyed with the banal reality of it that is presented to him. In turn, he becomes disillusioned with his idealisation of Mangan's sister as well. In the last sentence this notion is captured: \\"Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger\\" where his realisation becomes an epiphanic moment. He now views the world differently as he now realises his own vanity and stupidity as he now has more self-awareness of himself. = Eveline = Eveline centres around the character of the same name who has been given a chance to escape her life with a man called Frank who is in love with her, however, Eveline's family is the cause of her paralysis. Her mother and brother have died, one of her brothers is always away and her father is an abusive drunkard. It could be assumed that her father's nature would provide greater reason for her to leave but when the opportunity arises for her to escape she simply cannot as she states that \\"it was impossible\\" as she realises her situation. Eveline feels with Frank that, \\"all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing...No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish.\\" This is Eveline's epiphany that she cannot escape even though she wanted to she cannot leave behind her familial ties. = A Little Cloud = A Little Cloud is a part of the Dubliners short story collection centring around the protagonist, Little Chandler who reunites with an old friend, Ignatius Gallaher who is a more worldly man than himself. Little Chandler wishes to change his life, but the harsh reality of Dublin intrudes upon his hopes and in his moment of epiphany when he realises that it is useless to try to change his reality. Little Chandler's first epiphany begins when he reunites with Gallaher who is successful in the world after he left Dublin. During this conversation between the two men is when Little Chandler realises and starts to believe that the only way to be successful in life is to leave Dublin. Little Chandler then returns home to a house full of hate and regret where he his wife controls him and he does not love her and who made him give up what he does love - poetry. Upon his return home, he looks into a photograph of his wife as he looks, \\"coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly,\\" back to him. He feels a deep rush of despair and regret for marrying his wife as he realises that, \\"dull resentment against his life awoke within him.\\" His child begins to cry and wail whilst Little Chandler was pondering his life and he finds he does not know what to do to make the child stop. The wife eventually rushes in and scolds Little Chandler: \\"'What have you done to him?\\" This is when the final epiphany starts to form itself as he looks into her eyes and his \\"heart closed together\\" upon gazing into her cold eyes. The last sentence capsulises the epiphany as, \\"Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.\\" The tears of remorse that begin to fill up his eyes are symbolic of his emotion of regret for his life and the uselessness his feels in never being able to change the trajectory of his life in the way that he wants. = The Dead = The short story \\"The Dead\\" express the paralysis of the epiphany Joyce‚Äôs character Gabriel experiences in discovering his wife‚Äôs grief over her first love. The line \\"It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life,\\" provides a tonal shift from Gabriel lusting after his wife to being dumbstruck by the realisation that he may not be enough for his wife. When Gretta (wife) listens to D‚ÄôArcy singing \\"The Lass of Aughrim\\", she is reminded of her first love‚Äôs death. Gabriel realises that while he has been lusting after her she has been comparing him to another man. This section of the story is influenced by Joyce‚Äôs love of Irish music.  William Wordsworth's \\"Spots of time\\"  William Wordsworth was a Romantic poet in the 1800s. He became renowned through his collaboration with Samual Taylor Coleridge on the collection of poems titled the Lyrical Ballads. In Wordsworth's time, epiphanies had not yet been given that term and were referred to by Wordsworth as \\"spots of time.\\" There is an agreement that the modern term for the literature device \\"epiphany\\" began with Romanticism and in particular with the works of William Wordsworth. Wordsworth's innovation of \\"spots of time\\" in his poems have affected modern fiction and the modern short story. = The Prelude = The main plot points of The Prelude center upon the exploration of epiphany, which Wordsworth presents as vital to the history of his imagination. Two central themes to The Prelude are of childhood and memory and the adventures that Wordsworth has had as a child in the Lake District. These childhood memories, recollected in adulthood, include epiphanies that Wordsworth refers to as \\"spots of time.\\"  Book Twelve of The Prelude: Imagination and Taste, How Impaired and Restored  In the twelfth book of The Prelude, Wordsworth in his poem elaborates on the experience of the rejuvenating virtue that is given to him through his epiphanic moments that he recalls from childhood experience. > \\"There are in our existence spots of time,/ That with distinct pre-eminence > retain,/ A renovating virtue, whence--depressed/ By false opinion and > contentious thought,/ Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,/ In trivial > occupations, and the round/ Of ordinary intercourse--our minds/ Are > nourished and invisibly repaired;/ A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,/ > That penetrates, enables us to mount,/ When high, more high, and lifts us up > when fallen./ This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks/ Among those passages of > life that give/ Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,/ The mind is > lord and master--outward sense/ The obedient servant of her will. Such > moments/ Are scattered everywhere, taking their date/ From our first > childhood.\\" The language Wordsworth uses within this excerpt suggests that he has had many 'spots of time' that he could draw upon from his memory that could give him strength as they release to him a sense of epiphany in his new realisation of seeing the world in a recollection of youth.  Notable Authors that use epiphanies  The use of epiphanies as a stylistic and structural device in narrative and poetry came to prominence in the Romantic era.See Abrams, Beja, Nichols, Langbaum.

It is geographically the largest country in North Africa and has a population of approximately 42 million. Until the 1980s, Algeria enjoyed relative wealth after gaining independence from France in 1962 as its economy was buoyed by the booming price of oil. Poverty in Algeria became an acute problem following the collapse of its economic growth around the mid eighties. Since the 1980s, a fall in oil prices in international markets resulted in Algeria experiencing an economic downturn, contributing to rising unemployment and poverty. A lack of democracy, political conflict and government spending have also caused poverty.  Economy  According to The World Bank, Algeria's economy is predominantly reliant on the export of hydrocarbons, which constitutes about 30% of the country's GDP and 60% of budget revenues. Algeria has the tenth-largest natural gas reserve in the world and is the sixth-largest natural gas exporter. Natural gas and oil combined account for 95% of Algeria's export earnings. Algeria's large natural gas and oil reserves have enabled it to maintain relative macroeconomic stability. Algeria has struggled to forge non-hydrocarbon industries. Fluctuations in the price of oil have had a significant impact on the welfare on Algeria's population as the government has had to increase tax revenue. Since 2013, Algeria's foreign exchange reserves have dropped by more than 40%. This is mainly due to repeated project delays and difficulty in attracting investment. The fall in gas and oil revenues resulted in the Algerian government adopting corrective measures in the 2016 federal budget to reduce spending and offset the fall of oil prices. The 2016 budget involved a 4% increase in tax revenues and a 9% cut in expenditures. The Algerian government has refrained from directly reducing subsidies on healthcare, education and government-funded housing programs. = Prevalence of poverty= According to the National Statistics Office, Algeria has experienced significant reductions in poverty levels, falling to 5.5% in 2011 from 14.1% in 1995. Although the percentage of the population surviving on less than $2 per day stabilized at 14.1% in 1995 after decreasing from 81% in 1988, it has since fallen to 5% in 2011. The income share held by the poorest 20% of Algerians has increased from 6.5% in 1990 to 9.4% in 2010. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, the population below the poverty line in Algeria as of 2006 is estimated to be 25%, and rates of extreme poverty sit at 0.5%. However, 10% of Algeria's population is perceived to be susceptible to falling back into poverty if conditions conspire against them. Around 75% of Algerians living in poverty live in urban areas and complete informal work. Regional differences have resulted in twice the number of individuals living in poverty inhabiting Algeria's Sahara, and three times the nation's average living on grassland. According to the Global Hunger Index, of 119 qualifying countries, Algeria was placed 39th, with a score of 9.4, meaning that the nation suffers from a relatively low hunger level. This score has consistently improved over the past two decades. In 2000, Algeria recorded a score of 15.6 (moderate hunger level) and received a 10.6 (moderate hunger level) in 2010. In addition, the proportion of undernourished people has decreased from 10.7% in 2000 to 4.7% in 2018. However, the prevalence of undernourished children under 5 years of age has increased from 3.1% to 4.1% in 2018 and the occurrence of underweight children below 5 has decreased to 2.6% (2009). Further, the life expectancy at birth for Algeria as of 2016 is 76.078. High unemployment is the leading cause of poverty in Algeria. Analysis by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa reveals significant disparities in Algeria based on gender and age. The unemployment rate as of 2015 was estimated to be 11.2%; however, those within the age group 16-24 stood at almost 30%. In addition to this, unemployment affects almost twice the number of women as it does men, with unemployment estimated at 16.6% for women. According to The World Bank, persistent youth unemployment has a great impact on the development in household living conditions, leaving many youths unable to earn a decent wage and adequate standard of living. The labour force in 2001 was projected to be around 9 million or 29% of the whole population. The World Bank figures indicate that more than one third of the Algerian population subsist in poverty with 70% living in rural and remote regions. The persistent inability of Algerians to secure employment coupled with the predicted stagnation of their economy raises concerns of a possible increase in the number of households in precarious situations and the overall poverty rate. Approximately 10% of the overall population, equivalent to nearly 4 million Algerians, were seen as susceptible to sinking into poverty if circumstances continued to conspire against them.  Historical roots of Algeria's poverty  = French Colonisation of Algeria = Until 1517 to 1830, Algeria was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The weakening hold of the Ottoman Empire on Algeria led to a short-lived time of emancipation until the French monarch launched a war with the intention of complete occupation in 1830. As a result of the \\"fly whist incident\\", France declared a 3-year blockade against Algeria in 1827. Dey Hussein, the last Ottoman ruler in Algeria struck the French consul with a fly whisk after he unsuccessfully responded to the dey's questioning about the debt France owed to Algeria. The French conquest of Algeria was also coordinated to boost the declining stature of the French monarch. In response to the \\"fly whist incident\\", the French decided to declare a full fledge conquest of Algeria in 1830 with the intention of imposing French rule. After three weeks, Algeria was captured and annexed by France. = Impact of French Colonisation = The French colonisation of Algeria in 1830 had a significant impact on Algeria's national identity and social system. After French colonisation, there was a large influx of mainly working-class Europeans from Italy, Spain and France into Algeria. The usurpation of Algeria by French soldiers resulted in many Indigenous Algerian farmers becoming dispossessed from their land as they were handed over to European colonists. French authorities sold land belonging to Algerian natives without justification nor compensation, leaving many labouring on land now owned by Europeans for minimum wage. By the end of the 1950s, the French population in Algeria was estimated to be at one million and most of these settlers owned most of the fertile land in Algeria. The usurpation of Algerian land and their subsequent dispossession led to the disintegration of Algeria's traditional institutions as French colonists limited the population of Algerian natives to basic human goods. In 1940 to 1945, only 9% of the Muslim children population in Algeria was enrolled in primary school and the estimated rate of illiteracy in adults was 86%. By 1988, unemployment had risen to 25% as the disparity between rich and poor continued to grow and the standard of living declined. Within the social sphere, the Algerians were socially displaced as the majority of Algerians lost their social status as a result of continued oppression by French colonists. European settlers held more power and earned higher incomes than the Algerians who were in positions of subservience and poverty. = The Algerian crisis = In the mid 1980s, basic macroeconomic indicators deteriorated between 1987 and 1995 resulting in prolonged economic recession, high rates of national debt and growing social unhappiness. The lack of economic growth in Algeria meant that the creation of employment was absent, and unemployment rose to 27% in 1994 as a result. Previously, the government responded to rising growth in job seeking by intensifying public sector employment. However, as economic activity declined and oil prices collapsed, the public sector employment slowed down which in turn contributed to the rising rates of poverty. By 1986, Algeria was faced with increasing political and economic strain when the price of oil fell 50% from the previous year. This resulted in Algeria's GDP growth to decline into negative 2.7%. The fall in oil prices led to an economic and political crisis as protestors took to the streets demanding a solution to the economic crisis and political reformation for more efficient policies in line with a freer democracy.  Government responses Algeria strengthened its fight to reduce poverty and social development policy at the end of the 1990s, which facilitated advancement in the standard of living among the Algerian population. The provisions of the Finance Bill 2016 allocated most of its budget to sectors such as education (15.9%), health (7.9%) and employment assistance (4.7%), thereby enabling increased standards of living and reduced rates of poverty. Unemployment rates have dropped over the last decade, with a report from 2008 stating that unemployment among individuals under 30 was at an extremely high 70%. High unemployment rates combined with low quality of life forced the youth of Algeria to undertake desperate measures, such as illegal immigration, to find work in Europe. =Subsidies and transfers = Due to the resources drawn from exporting hydrocarbons, a programme of social support is made possible, including subsidies of retail prices among other social transfers. This helps contain social pressure, and allows Algeria to invest more heavily into the development of human capital, thereby reducing poverty. = Social housing = Holding 14.21% of the total equipment budget of Algeria, the state of Algeria enables access for population to housing though various programme, the main being the National Agency for Housing Improvement and Development. =Consumer prices = Algeria maintains among the ail price of oil and gas in the world thanks to subsidies, and the state subsidizes the water supply to households in coastal towns, financing the desalination of seawater. In addition, the subsidizing of milk, cereal and other essential products make it possible to keep these items at an affordable price for the population.  Challenges facing Algeria  Tackling inequality is a significant challenge for the nation of Algeria. Consumption rate inequalities are high, and there is a 27.7% gap between the rich and poor, which has improved significantly from 40.2% in 1988. In order to tackle poverty, addressing the largest cause, unemployment, is vital for Algeria. In understanding this, the government has put in place a number of initiatives to reduce unemployment. This is done through the facilitation and integration of a significant number of unemployed youth into the workforce, utilizing programmes implemented by national youth employment provision agencies. In addition to this, the Government set up a system of benefits to provide financial support to the unemployed, equipping them with necessary skills to assist in their integration back into the workforce. As a result of government intervention, between 2010‚Äì2015, over 1.5 million young people in Algeria were placed in the workforce. This, however, is an inadequate number given the high levels of youth unemployment which contributes highly to the poverty rate. Aside from unemployment, Algeria has made notable increases in social and human development in recent years, with social indicators such as education, health, and access to basic services recording substantial developments. Algeria currently records a high level of income and human development. This, combined with attempts to reduce unemployment rates, will help Algeria combat poverty. = Political division and lack of democracy = In a way to justify the nations economic position, many Algerians blame ineffective and unresponsive political leadership. The National Liberation Front reduced the nation to bankruptcy, contributing to the level of poverty within Algeria. Additionally, the Algerian Civil War between the government and armed Islamic Rebel groups between the years of 1991 and 2001, coupled with political tensions after the war, deteriorated the nations economic and political stability, reducing the quality of life for the population of Algeria, and in turn increasing levels of poverty. The absence of a democratic institute is a further source of poverty in Algeria. Although the president of Algeria, 80-year-old Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is well respected for getting the nation out of civil war and eliminating militant and radical jihadi groups, the administration under his instruction has grown intolerant of political conflict and press. In addition, there is a struggle for power between the progressive National Liberation Front political party and conservative Islamic Front. Any political instability can have devastating effects on rates of poverty.

During this period, various types of objects were produced such as domestic tools, weaponry, jewellery, and decorative figurines. This range of art attests to the blend of both native and foreign influences of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome as they successively occupied the country. Artworks produced in ancient Cyprus incorporate almost all of the mediums of visual art worked on in ancient history including terracotta, stone, metals, glass, and gemstones.  Prehistoric Period (c. 10,000 - c. 1050 BC)  = Pre-Neolithic (c. 10,000 - c. 8500 BC) and Neolithic (c. 8500 - c. 3900 BC) Periods = In c. 10,000 BC, seasonal hunters of pygmy hippopotami and elephants were present on the island. The first Neolithic settlers in Cyprus originated from either the Syro-Palestinian coast or southern Anatolia, forming communities founded on agriculture. It was towards the end of the Neolithic period when people began to bake moulded clay into vessels which were frequently embellished with abstract designs in red on a light slip.Hemingway, Colette, and Se√°n Hemingway. ‚ÄúPrehistoric Cypriot Art and Culture.‚Äù In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcyp/hd_pcyp.htm (October 2004)228x228px = Chalcolithic Period (c. 3900 - c. 2500 BC) = During this period, a new flood of Syro-Palestinian and Anatolian migrants introduced a more advanced culture where religion was practised and art processes became more complex. Examples of such art are that of female figurines formed from clay or stone‚Äîin particular the local stone picrolite‚Äîwith prominent genitals which represented fertility as one of the crucial values of agrarian society at the time. Towards the end of this period, small implements and ornamental decorations began to be hammered from copper, ' in Greek, hence giving the name of this era of progression from the Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age. Despite the continuation of agriculture, certain developments such as diversified burial procedures, the building of unique religious installations, and the use of seals indicate a more sophisticated and organised society. = Early Bronze Age (c. 2500 - c. 1900 BC) = Profound changes caused by incoming coastal Asia Minor migrants and other intra-societal processes marked the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Communities began to move, settling in areas of fertile land near sources of water. Influences from the Near East, where metallurgy was highly developed, established standardised procedures of mining, extracting, and smelting of the rich copper ores found in Cyprus. This resource would become a valued export of high demand throughout Mediterranean antiquity during the Middle Bronze Age. Although Cypriot society was still rooted in agriculture, bronze-smiths began to manufacture unique ornaments and tools following personal techniques towards the end of Early Bronze Age.337x337px = Middle Bronze Age (c. 1900 - c. 1650 BC) = The distinctive geographical location of Cyprus in the centre of Eastern Mediterranean maritime trade allowed for the country to become a significant commercial hub. This advantage also provided the country the ability to build contacts with Egypt, the Near East, Minoan Crete, and Mycenaean Greece. However, despite progressive social organisation, the profound distinctions in wealth as evidenced in burials highlight the explicit social divisions at the time. Such divide and local disputes resulted in the construction of fortifications in many settlements. The shapes and designs of pottery produced in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages were innovative and creative. Terracotta was used extensively to produce statuettes for tomb burials. Other burial items, particularly those for men, consisted of bronze weaponry and tools. Cylinder seals and use of gold and silver for jewellery were gradually popularised as well. With the increasing need for more complex ways of expressing religion, ceremonial sites and unique metalworks were constructed. Such constructions give evidence of the growing significance of metals like copper in Cyprus. By the end of the Bronze Age, Near Eastern and Aegean influences allowed for Cyprus to develop the art of engraving and carving to a large extent. = Late Bronze Age (c. 1650 - c. 1050 BC) = During the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus was producing copper on a colossal scale and exporting it throughout the entire Eastern Mediterranean to be bartered for commodities and luxury goods. Various works of alabaster and faience, displayed within The Cesnola Collection, were imported from Egypt during the first half of the 14th century BC. The recent archaeological discovery off the Anatolian coast of ten tonnes of copper in a 14th-century BC shipwreck at Ulu Burun show the large scope of Cyprus‚Äô seafaring commerce. Jars holding Cypriot pottery and products of agriculture such as coriander were also found in the excavation. 229x229px By the Late Bronze Age, Cypriot art could be seen as a mixture of both domestic pressures and foreign influences. Adaptations of foreign stylistic elements from the Aegean, the Near East, and Egypt led to their reinterpretation and as a result incorporation into unique Cypriot customs. Particularly during the 12th century BC, bronze-work, writing, jewellery, and stone seal carvings were all influenced by the Aegean. From c. 1500 BC, Cypriots commenced using an undecipherable Cypro-Minoan script adopted from Crete which gave them the means to manage records and inventories at a time when social organisation was becoming increasingly complex. This script can be seen on clay tablets and records found in metropolitan cities such as Enkomi and Kalavasos. The Cesnola Collection also contains numerous vases on which some characters of this ancient script is visible. Upon excavations of rich burial grounds and 14th to 13th century BC urban centres like Enkomi, luxurious artefacts made from a range of materials have been discovered. Burial chambers of an elite class have further unearthed nearly exclusively a collection of imported Mycenaean vessels from the 14th century. While the arts in Cyprus thrived, social inequities arose as a result of the flux of imported wealth and resources. During the latter part of the 13th century BC, unrest took over Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, leaving cities in ruins and generating a surge of Aegean refugees to Cyprus. However, despite the turmoil, Cyprus managed to eventually recover its economic and commercial success.194x194px  Cypro- Geometric Period (c. 1050 - c. 750 BC)  After its recuperation, new settlements arose in Cyprus as a result of the influx of Greek and Achaean immigrants who brought with them their Mycenaean culture in the forms of pottery, clothing, weaponry, burial customs, and the Greek language. The country maintained its role as a main exporter of raw materials in the Mediterranean, and eventually introduced a new local syllabic script in the 11th century BC which was in use until the 3rd century BC for the writing of ancient Greek and Cypriot language. The establishment of a Phoenician settlement at Kition on the southern coast in around 900 BC further pushed Cyprus‚Äô trade as the Phoenicians were interested in the plentiful copper and wood resources for shipbuilding. With this, the Phoenician language was adopted, and foreign ideas such as the cult of the goddess Astarte were assimilated into Cypriot culture. However, despite such imported customs at the time, Cypriot art managed to maintain its native characteristics. Pottery of this period was generally produced from Proto-White Painted Ware, but the Cypriots also painted in black and red. Advancements in the political structure of society could be seen in the founding of ten kingdoms ruled by kings called wanaktes,Department of Greek and Roman Art. ‚ÄúGeometric and Archaic Cyprus.‚Äù In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gcyp/hd_gcyp.htm (October 2004) as evidenced in a 7th century BC inscription. Limestone stele with the head of Hathor from Cyprus (c. 575 - c. 550 BC)  Cypro-Archaic Period (c. 750 - c. 480 BC)  Evidence revealing the surrender of the Cypriot rulers to Assyria in 709 BC was found on a stele at Kition, and the kingdoms remained under Assyrian rule until 669 BC. Prosperity and cultural incitement in the kingdoms followed, and the kings of Cyprus were able to self-rule as long as they paid frequent tribute to the king of Assyria. The riches and foreign relations of these Cypriot kings can be seen in evidence found in royal burial chambers at Salamis. In 669 BC, Cyprus became independent, a rare circumstance in Cypriot history that lasted until the country was subjugated by Egypt under Amasis II in 560 BC. During this time, the extent of Egyptian control was evident in the increasing use of Egyptian symbols in Cypriot art, such as the head of Hathor which was found commonly on art pieces from Amathus. It could also be seen in the many stone sculptures of male votaries. Cypriot sculpture in the Cypro- Archaic Period was characterised by polychrome decoration which was also used in Greece. Terracotta during this time was often painted, and the development of the mould meant that figurine production could be accelerated to a great extent. In 545 BC, Cyprus was conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia, but allied with the Ionian Greeks in 499 BC in attempt to rebel against the Persian invaders. Undeterred by the fluctuations in power, Cyprus remained prosperous as a pivotal trade hub, and religious practices did not change with new rule. 204x204px  Cypro-Classical Period (c. 480 - c. 310 BC)  Until Cyprus was liberated by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, there was a constant power struggle for Cypriot independence against the Persians. During the Cypro-Classical era, sculptures, jewellery, clothing, and other art forms began to take on many Hellenic elements as a result of increased affiliation with the Greeks who aided the Cypriots in their attempts to depose the Persians. Sculptures in this period were generally made from terracotta or limestone and could only be afforded by the affluent. Although the influence of Greek culture was evident in the arts of Cyprus, the Cypriots still kept and used their own artistic styles. One prominent example is that of a Golgoi sarcophagus adorned with warriors in battle which is a scene commonly seen in Greek art. However, the Cypriot artist combines a hunting scene with this landscape, whereby the proportions of the animals are clearly distinctive from those found in Hellenic works. Similarly, Cypriot jewellery, in particular those made from gold, reveal a combination of both local and Greek artistic styles. East Greek influences from the sixth century BC gave rise to freestanding Cypriot sculptures that exhibited common Hellenic features such as the subtle smile and forward left foot.Department of Greek and Roman Art. ‚ÄúClassical Cyprus (ca. 480‚Äìca. 310 B.C.).‚Äù In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ccyp/hd_ccyp.htm (July 2007) Further Reading  Hellenistic and Roman Periods (c. 310 BC - c. 330 AD)  Art in Cyprus eventually came to assimilate Hellenistic elements as the Ptolemies conquered the country in 300 BC. Although artistic elements of ancient Athens influenced Cypriot burial architecture and other art forms in the beginning, Egyptian styles ultimately superseded. After the Romans seized control in 58 BC, Cyprus once again became a vibrant trading centre. Eastern Mediterranean traders and artists, including sculptors, brought with them a range of foreign artistic practices as they entered the country. As marble and bronze sculptures were increasingly imported from the Aegean, traditional limestone sculptures started to diminish. Hellenistic elements were still prevalent in Cypriot sculpture, ceramics and jewellery during this time. Ultimately, all forms of Cypriot art became influenced by Roman techniques and styles.Department of Greek and Roman Art. ‚ÄúHellenistic and Roman Cyprus.‚Äù In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

His work is reflective of the shin-hanga artists of the early to mid-20th century, employing subjects such as landscapes, tattoos, and bijin. Biography Binnie was born in Airthrey Castle, Scotland on 27 May 1967 and studied art history at the University of Edinburgh and painting and etching at Edinburgh College of Art from 1985 to 1990. After taking his Master's degree (honours) in 1990 he moved to Paris until his interest in Japanese ukiyo-e prints took him to Japan in 1993. There he studied woodblock printmaking as an apprentice to Seki Kenji, master printer of Doi publisher. While in Japan, Binnie began experimenting with kappazuri (stencil printing). His first stencil prints were depictions of tattooed figures, followed by yakusha-e (kabuki actor prints). By late 1995, Binnie had left Seki‚Äôs studio to concentrate on his own work, primarily focusing on actor prints, a genre which he had begun to collect. His interest increased in actor prints by shin-hanga artists such as Natori Shunsen and Masamitsu Ota, and he also began to collect fukeiga (landscape prints) by artists such as Hasui Kawase and Hiroshi Yoshida. Cho Musubi (Butterfly Bow), 2005, woodblock print, incorporated an historical reference to Red and White Plum Blossoms by Ogata K≈çrin In 1998, Binnie moved to London and set up his own studio, where he expanded his subjects to include cloud studies, landscapes, and bijin (beautiful women). While his actor prints were largely concerned with capturing an actor's expression in a given moment, his landscape and bijin prints often incorporated an historical reference, usually to well-known Japanese prints or paintings. His Shiki (Four Seasons) series, for example, referenced prints of shin-hanga artists such as Goy≈ç Hashiguchi and Shinsui It≈ç. Hokusai no Taki (Hokusai's Waterfalls), 2006, woodblock print. The depicted tattoos were based on prints from A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces by Hokusai \\"Hokusai's Waterfalls\\", Scholten Japanese Art, Retrieved on September 11, 2018. In 2004, Binnie returned to depicting tattooed figures, both male and female, in the series, A Hundred Shades of Ink of Edo in which he applied designs from ukiyo-e artists such as Hokusai and Hiroshige to nude figures. Each of the ten prints in the series was based on the work of an individual ukiyo-e artist. Soon after completion of the tenth print in 2015, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York purchased the complete series for its collection.\\"Paul Binnie  Utamaro‚Äôs Erotica\\", Metropolitan Museum of Art, Retrieved on September 11, 2018.

It was built by Brian McMahon. It is also known as McMahon's Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Berrima is the second oldest (European) settlement in Wingecarribee Shire and the oldest continuing settlement in the shire. The first town settlement in the district was in 1821 at Bong Bong, 8km south-east of Berrima on the Wingecarribee River. The site of Berrima was selected by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1829 on a visit planning the route for a new road alignment from Sydney to replace the old Argyle Road, which had proven unsatisfactory due to a steep hill climb over the Mittagong Range and river crossing at Bong Bong. In 1830 Mitchell instructed Robert Hoddle to mark out the town based on a plan Mitchell's office prepared, along the lines of a traditional English village (with a central market place and as many blocks as possible facing onto the WIngecarribee River), and using the local Aboriginal name. The new line of road came through the town. Berrima was to be established as the commercial and administrative centre for the County of Camden. In 1832, Bryan McMahon (occasionally recorded as McMahon) received one of the first land grants in Berrima, when he was granted title to the property containing both the Coach and Horses Inn and Berrima Inn (also known as McMahon's Inn) sites at the corner of Bryan and Jellore Streets.Webb, 2008, 5, 10, 34 McMahon had previously been an innkeeper at Sutton Forest. The Berrima Inn was one of the first inns to operate in Berrima, along with the Surveyor- General Inn and the Mail Coach Inn. By 1834 McMahon had erected a purpose built inn of simple face brick with traditional colonial 12 pane windows and hipped roof in traditional Colonial Georgian cottage style. A verandah supported on squared posts faced the street frontage.Webb, 2008, 34 This inn was issued the first Inn licence in Berrima in 1834 which continued to run until 1848 when it became the residence for Brian McMahon and his family, two years before McMahon died. Bryan Patrick McMahon (son of Bryan) had inherited Lots 1 & 2 Section 2 and in 1862 sold both lots containing the original Berrima Inn and the stone and brick building to Francis Breen from the Commercial Inn.Webb, 2008, 34 Governor Bourke executed the inn's land grant in 1862, transferring it to Francis Breen, innkeeper. Breen was already a previous innkeeper having owned Breen's Commercial Hotel in Berrima in 1840 (since renamed the Colonial Inn, the Old Breen's restaurant and currently named \\"Eschalot\\" restaurant). The Berrima Inn remained a private residence from its sale to Breen in 1862 until the 1990s when it became a retail outlet for crafts. Since 1990 it has oscillated between a commercial restaurant/cafe and private residence. In 2005 it was converted back from the Bantam Cafe to a private residence.  Description  The original inn building and a simple two car garage are the only buildings on this site. The property retains its relationship with Jellore Street and the Wingecarribee River to the north. The inn is a simple face brick construction built by 1834 as a purpose-built inn. It has traditional colonial 12 pane windows and a hipped roof in Colonial Georgian cottage style. A verandah supported on squared posts faced the street frontage. An extension to mirror the original was later added.  Heritage listing  Berrima Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The gang was composed mostly of bodybuilders who frequented the Sun Gym in Miami Lakes, Florida including Daniel Lugo and Adrian Doorbal. Pete Collins published a three-part series in the Miami New Times in 1999 and 2000 chronicling the stories of the gang titled \\"Pain and Gain\\" which was then loosely adapted into the 2013 film Pain & Gain directed by Michael Bay.  Origins  In 1993 Daniel Lugo was the manager of the Sun Gym, a bodybuilder hangout in Miami Lakes, Florida. In 1991, Lugo had been arrested and plead guilty to fraud, serving a fifteen- month sentence in addition to a three-year federal probation period. He had been convicted of fraud for pretending to be part of a Hong Kong bank that was looking to invest in American small businesses-- the scheme involved collecting up-front fees for loan insurance, and then not actually delivering any loans. Noel Doorbal worked part-time at the gym alongside Lugo. During 1994, Carl Weekes moved from New York to Miami to live with his girlfriend's cousin, Stevenson Pierre. Pierre had been hired by Lugo in February 1994 to create a collection agency for overdue gym membership payments. When this didn't work out, he remained at the gym first as the back-office manager in the weight room before ending up as a desk clerk. Jorge Delgado worked out with Daniel Lugo as his personal trainer at the Sun Gym. It was Delgado's relationship with Lugo that caused a rift between Delgado and the Sun Gym Gang's first victim: Marc Schiller. Jorge Delgado and Marc Schiller had been business partners since about 1991, and Schiller trusted Delgado so much that Delgado knew the alarm code and layout of Schiller's home.  Crimes  = The abduction and extortion of Marc Schiller = In a 1994 meeting, Daniel Lugo asked Noel Doorbal and Stevenson Pierre whether they were interested in making $100,000 for two days' work. According to Lugo, businessman Marc Schiller had stolen $100,000 from him and $200,000 from another gym member named Jorge Delgado. At another meeting a few days later, Delgado agreed to the plan to abduct Schiller, force him to sign over his assets, and potentially kill him. Delgado was able to give specific information about Schiller, including the codes to his house. The gang had varying plans and made attempts to kidnap Schiller. For Halloween they planned to wear ninja outfits and knock on Schiller's door; this plan did not transpire. On an early morning in November, Doorbal, Pierre, and Weekes, dressed in black and wearing gloves and black military camouflage makeup, crawled across the lawn planning to storm the house when Schiller went to get the papers. However, they were spooked by a passing car and aborted the mission. In total there were 7 failed abductions. The final failed abduction occurred on Thursday, November 14, 1994. After this last failed attempt, Doorbal and Weekes dropped Pierre and recruited Mario Sanchez, or \\"Big Mario,\\" a former Sun Gym weightlifting instructor and licensed Florida private eye. That same afternoon, Schiller was waiting for a prospective buyer at a Schlotzsky's franchise delicatessen he owned. When, at 4pm, the buyer still had not turned up, Schiller left and was grabbed by three men while walking across the parking lot, who stunned him with tasers and then punched him and forced him into a van. The Sun Gym gang then took Schiller to Delgado's warehouse. That evening, they retrieved Schiller's car from the Deli parking lot and drove it to the warehouse. That first evening the gang made Schiller call his wife and tell her to go with his children to Colombia, giving the gang access to his house. Over a period of weeks, the gang made Schiller tell a series of stories and under pressure sign over all of his assets, making dozens of requests for his autographs. Initially planned as two day abduction, the abduction went over a period of weeks as they converted assets from Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. The last money transfer was made on December 10. Finally, the gang decided they would kill Schiller with a 2 million dollar MetLife Insurance policy designated to Lugo's ex-wife Lillian Torres as the new beneficiary. The gang planned to get Schiller drunk over the course of a few days and send him out in his car in a fatal crash. At 2:30am on December 15, after 3 days of forced drinking, Schiller was placed into the passenger seat of his car with Lugo driving while Weekes and Doorbal followed in the Camry. A crash site was chosen three blocks south of Schlotzky's. Schiller was then strapped into the driver's seat and Lugo moved into the passenger side and stomped the gas pedal and steered the vehicle toward a concrete utility pole jumping out just before the collision. When Lugo inspected the wreckage, Schiller was alive but unconscious. Lugo then splashed gasoline over him and lit a blaze, however Schiller opened the door and climbed out of the car. The gang chased him in their cars nailing him against a wall. They almost went back to hit Schiller again, but another car approached causing them to abscond. Schiller was admitted into hospital on December 16, 1994 being treated as a John Doe and possible DUI case. Meanwhile, the Sun Gym Gang, after hearing of no one being admitted into the morgue, started calling area hospitals. They discovered that Schiller was at South Miami Hospital and in a critical, but stable, condition. The gang visited the hospital with the intention of killing Schiller, but he had already been transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital. By early January 1995, Lugo moved into Schiller's home that was now owned by D&J; International, a Bahamian Company set up by Lugo in the year prior. He told residents of the neighborhood that his name was ‚ÄúTom‚Äù and that he and the other gang members were members of the US Security Forces. According to them, Marc Schiller had run into Legal trouble and had been deported along with his family. The house was now confiscated and became government property. = Winston Lee = In 1994 Daniel Lugo again planned to extort and kidnap Winston Lee, a Jamaican man who frequented Sun Gym. However, this plan never transpired. = Abduction, attempted extortion, and murders of Frank Griga and Krisztina Furton = Through Noel Doorbal, the gang were informed of another wealthy man, Hungarian Frank Griga who had made his fortune by running a phone-sex empire. Through a past girlfriend, Doorbal had been introduced to Atilla Weiland, who knew Griga and introduced Doorbal and his \\"cousin\\" Daniel Lugo to Griga on May 20, 1995. Doorbal convinced Lugo to form a plan to kidnap and extort the couple. At this meeting, Lugo and Doorbal posed as serious business men, offering Griga investment opportunities. Lugo involved his girlfriend, Sabina Petrescu, who believed that Lugo was a CIA agent and that she was assisting him in his mission to capture a Hungarian businessman who was guilty of using women for sex and circumventing US tax laws. On the 25th of May 1995, after several meetings, Doorbal killed Griga during a fight at his apartment. The gang planned to bring Griga back to a warehouse where they could begin to extort him as they had Schiller; however, they were frustrated in their plan when they accidentally killed the victim early. Krisztina Furton, Griga's girlfriend, was also at the apartment talking to Lugo in a separate room to Doorbal and Griga. After witnessing her partner murdered, she was injected with Rompun - a horse tranquilliser - by Lugo. The gang began to attempt to extract information from Furton regarding the codes which would grant entry into Griga's home, whilst continuing to inject her with Rompun. After this, Furton stopped supplying them with information. A third dose of tranquilliser was administered, resulting in her death. The next day ‚Äì May 26, 1995 ‚Äì Griga's body was concealed in Marc Schiller's stolen couch and Furton's body into a U-Haul clothing box. Both were placed into the back of a van and Delgado, Lugo and Doorbal drove to Lugo's Hialeah warehouse. It was here that the gang dismembered and disposed of the bodies of Griga and Furton, with Doorbal doing most of the work.  Downfall  After his ordeal, Marc Schiller hired Miami private investigator Ed Du Bois to investigate his kidnapping and missing finances whilst he remained in Colombia. When Du Bois initially brought Schiller's ordeal to the Miami police, they were skeptical and didn't believe Schiller's story. Therefore, they only made minor inquiries into the case. The morning after the disappearance of Griga and Furton, housekeeper Ester Toth arrived at Griga's house. She was shocked to find their dog barking unattended, sparking her suspicions. She acquired the help of Judi Blartusz ‚Äî a friend of Furton ‚Äî and the two entered the empty house together. Shortly following, Bartusz contacted their mutual Hungarian friends in the Miami area to see if they knew the whereabouts of the couple. After some time, the Golden Beach Police Department were called. At 7:30 am, on the 31st of May 1995, Lloyd Alvarez, a friend of Griga's, spotted Griga's yellow Lamborghini travelling in a convoy between two other cars. He followed the trio of cars, and recognised Daniel Lugo in the Mercedes. Beatriz Weiland and Attila Weiland were contacted by police, who began speaking to them. Eight days after the disappearance of Griga and Furton, Capt. Al Harper phoned Ed Du Bois and they began to collaborate with the police investigation. On Friday June 2, Marc Schiller returned to Miami, two months after he had first told investigators his story. The next morning, Metro‚ÄìDade police served warrants on the houses of Daniel Lugo, Jorge Delgado, Noel Doorbal and John Mese. Lugo had already fled to the Bahamas, but was arrested five days later in Nassau by a multi- agency task force, who brought him back on a commercial flight to Miami. On June 10, Lugo agreed to reveal the hiding place of the bodies in return for the police mentioning his helpfulness to a jury. He brought them to the submerged barrels in Southwest Miami, however the drums did not contain the heads, hands, and feet of the victims that were crucial to identification. Following this event, Lugo ceased cooperation with the police. The body of Furton was later identified through her breast implants' serial number, which was matched to the records held by her plastic surgeon.http://fall.fsulawrc.com/flsupct/sc93988/93988ini.pdf A month later, information about the missing body parts was supplied by an anonymous caller. Police also arrested Carl Weekes and Stevenson Pierre. John Mese was returned to police custody after the initial interrogation. Sabina Petrescu and Cindy Eldridge also faced charges.  Trial and convictions  The trials of Daniel Lugo, Noel \\"Adrian\\" Doorbal and John Mese occurred simultaneously with two juries picked - one listening to the evidence against Lugo and a second to listen to the evidence against Doorbal and Mese. The trial, which began on February 24, 1998 was the longest and most expensive criminal trial in the history of Dade County. It featured more than 1200 pieces of physical evidence and 98 witnesses. = Daniel Lugo = On 2 October 1996, Daniel Lugo was indicted on 46 counts and pleaded guilty to all of the charges of indictment, these were: > Count I Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering Count II Racketeering Count III > First-Degree Murder (Furton) Count IV First-Degree Murder (Griga) Count V > Kidnapping Count VI Kidnapping Count VIII Attempted Extortion Count IX Grand > Theft Auto Count X Attempted First-Degree Murder Count XI Armed Kidnapping > Count XII Armed Robbery Count XIII Burglary Count XIV Grand Theft (Second- > Degree) Count XV Grand Theft Auto Count XVI Possession of an Identification > Plate Count XVII Arson Count XVIII Extortion Count XIX Money Laundering > (Counts XIX ‚Äì XXVII) Count XXVIII Forgery (Counts XXVIII, XXXI, XXXIV, > XXVII, XL, XLIII) Count XXX Uttering a Forged Instrument (Counts XXX, XXIII, > XXXVI, IXL, XLII, XLV) Count XLVI Conspiracy to Commit a First-Degree Felony He remains on death row for the murders of Griga and Krisztina Furton and has made multiple unsuccessful appeals against his sentence. = Noel \\"Adrian\\" Doorbal = On 2 October 1996, Doorbal was indicted and sentenced to the following counts on 17 July 1998: > Count I Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering ‚Äì 30 years Count II Racketeering ‚Äì > 30 years Count III First-Degree Murder (Furton) ‚Äì Death Count IV First- > Degree Murder (Griga) ‚Äì Death Count V Kidnapping ‚Äì Life imprisonment Count > VI Kidnapping ‚Äì Life imprisonment Count VIII Attempted Extortion ‚Äì 5 years > Count IX Grand Theft Auto ‚Äì 5 years Count X Attempted First-Degree Murder ‚Äì > Life imprisonment Count XI Armed Kidnapping ‚Äì Life imprisonment Count XII > Armed Robbery ‚Äì Life imprisonment Count XIII Burglary ‚Äì 15 years Count XIV > Grand Theft (Second-Degree) ‚Äì 15 years Count XVII Arson ‚Äì 30 years Count > XVIII Extortion ‚Äì 30 years Count XLVI Conspiracy to Commit a First-Degree > Felony ‚Äì 15 years Because of changes to capital punishment laws, Doorbal has had his death sentence overturned in 2017. He may still come before a jury again if Miami prosecutors seek the death penalty. = John Mese = Mese was indicted on 2 October 1996 for the kidnapping, extortion and murders of Furton and Griga in addition to crimes against Schiller. On 20 July 1998, Mese was sentenced to 56 years imprisonment for the kidnapping and extortion of Schiller, after a judge set aside the convictions for the Griga and Furton crimes. Mese appealed and the State cross-appealed the sentence to the Florida District Court of Appeal, Third District. The District Court of Appeal Judge ruled that at trial, the judge had improperly set aside the two Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation convictions and ordered a new sentencing hearing to occur on those counts. On 15 January 2003, Mese was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for one count of Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering. = Jorge Delgado = In return for testifying in favour of the state, Delgado was sentenced to two prison terms of 5 and 15 years. He served only seven years in jail and was released from the Everglades Correctional Institution in West Dade on 27 September 2002. In 2008, he was arrested for felony grand-theft receiving one year of probation. = John Raimondo = Raimondo was indicted on one count each of Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering, First-degree Murder (Furton), Kidnapping (Furton) and attempted extortion. He was convicted to one count of kidnapping and was sentenced to 8 years He was released in 2002. Following the release of the Pain & Gain film, Raimondo spoke to the Miami New Times about the film.

It is also known as Queen Victoria Inn and Allington. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The inn was built by Joseph Levy, an ex-convict turned prominent businessman, and was first licensed in 1840, operating as both an inn and brewery. Philip Solomon was the initial licensee. There is evidence in an early painting that the building once had a verandah. It was sold early in 1863, and no record of it operating as an inn in its original incarnation appears thereafter. An 1868 report refers to it in the past-tense, but notes that its stables were still in use by Cobb and Co. It later became a residence known as Allington and became the surgery of Dr. George Lambert in 1876. It operated as \\"Arlington House\\" or \\"Arlington Inn\\" for a period 1960s, but had resumed its original name by the late 1970s. The stables and boarding house were later refurbished as a restaurant, operating as the Victoria Inn Restaurant. It hosted Governor- General of Australia Zelman Cowen in 1986. It is no longer in operation. Description The former Victoria Inn is a one and a half storey Colonial Georgian sandstock brick cottage with sandstone quoins, lintels and sills. Symmetrical front facade has central panelled door with 4 pane fanlight. Windows are 2 x 6 pane double hung sashes. The roof is hipped and has wide boxed eaves. It has lath and plaster ceilings internally with cedar staircase and joinery. It has ten rooms with lift ceilings. The exterior is English bond brickwork. The internal doors are six panelled. The 2 attic rooms have dormer windows with decorative bargeboards. One cedar fireplace surround still exists. It has an extensive outbuilding wing at the rear, dating from varying periods. Significance The former Victoria Inn is significant through its association with the early settlement of Berrima and its role and as coaching stop on the road south in the early days of the colony. It is aesthetically significant as an early well built Georgian cottage which is relatively intact in form and has considerable early original detail. It further contributes to the historic character of Berrima village as the most important building in the Jellore Street group.

To this end, it sets up numerous cultural and artistic cooperations, particularly in the fields of contemporary music, theatre, cinema, design, architecture, urban planning and, more generally, in all creative industries. The French institute organizes each year the Night of IdeasNight of Ideas. (Nuit des id√©es in French) under the high patronage of the French Institute and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs. It also supports a wide variety of events in Estonia, like the venue of French artists to Estonia or annual events. Concerning music, it has supported Jazzkaar, Viljandi Folk Festival and also Guitar, Piano and Clavecin festivals. For movies, several events are supported by the French Institute: the Documentary Film Festival in P√§rnu et Matsalu, DocPoint in Tallinn, Wilcom in Viljandi, P√ñFF in Tallinn, H√ñFF in Haapsalu or the Tartu World Film Festival are supported yearly. The French Institute also works with the Estonian national broadcaster (ETV) in order to promote French cinema in Estonia. =Promotion of french and francophone literature= An online media library is available to the public since 2014: Cultureth√®que. This digital portal provides access to many resources in French throughout Estonia. The Institute works closely with translators and publishing houses wishing to translate and publish French literature. Translators can submit an application for a grant from the Centre national du livre that will allow them to stay in France to carry out a translation project. =French language= The teaching of French as a foreign language represents an important part of the Institute's activity; there are nearly 1000 registrations each year. The French Institute offers language courses for all levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), from A1 to C2. The Institute is an accredited official examination centre where it is possible to pass and obtain a French language certification such as DELF-DALF. The teaching of French at the Institute is certified by the Estonian Ministry of Education. The Institute has relations with all Estonian schools that teach French. For Tallinn, this includes: * The Vanalinna Hariduskolleegium (VHK) * The European School of Tallinn * The Gustav Adolf School =Academic and scientific cooperation= The Institute helps Estonian students and researchers when they are conducting research in France. A space is dedicated to Campus France,Campus France. in the premises of the IFE; it is an information centre for higher education and French courses in France. A performance is held every week. =Digital cooperation= The creation of a digital innovation cooperation in 2016 has made it possible to implement a strategy to promote French expertise in the field of digital and bring together decision-makers and civil society of the two countries. This strategy has three objectives: * Raise awareness among the Estonian public of French expertise on promising digital issues in both countries (holding public events, publishing online content, activity on social networks) * Facilitate cooperation between French and Estonian decision-makers (organisation of delegation visits, events with local institutions) * Bring civil societies closer together and facilitate their cooperation Directors of the French Institute of Estonia and cultural advisor The following have been directors of the IFE: * 1991‚Äì1995: B√©atrice Boillot * 1995‚Äì1999: Catherine Suard * 1999‚Äì2003: Genevi√©ve Ichard * 2003‚Äì2007: Jean-Louis Pelletan * 2007‚Äì2011: Denis Duclos * 2011‚Äì2015: Bernard Paqueteau * 2015‚Äì2019: Anne Chounet-Cambas * 2019‚Äì: Eric Bultel See also * French Embassy in Estonia * Lyc√©e fran√ßais de Tallinn References External links * L'Institut fran√ßais d'Estonie website * Cultureth√®que, la m√©diath√®que num√©rique * Ecole europ√©enne de Tallinn, who opened a French section in 2018 Organizations established in 1992 1992 establishments in Estonia Organizations based in Tallinn Culture in Tallinn Institut Fran√ßais ","title":"French Institute of Estonia"},{"id":"58456186","text":"Myint Naing (, born 5 July 1968) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as an Amyotha Hluttaw MP for Rakhine State No. 5 constituency.

They are usually referred to as 'thin winged cicada' in Taiwan and 'peaceful cicada' in China due to their abundance in these areas. They can be identified by their green appearance with thin, greenish, transparent wings and are heavily distributed in China, Taiwan, Japan, India and Malaya. However, there are limited number of scientific papers that describe the characteristics and behaviour of this species in detail. They are also used to be known as Rihana ochracea which was introduced by Distant (1904), claiming Rihana as a new genus. Genus Rihana however, was also known as a subgenus of Cicada Linnaeus and to some species from Cicada St√•l, Chremistica St√•l and Diceroprocta St√•l.  Characteristics  operculum can be seen clearly on this cicada (not Chremistica ochracea). It is round and greenish, located on the abdomen, close to the thorax. Based on diagnosis on all Chremistica species erected by St√•l in 1870, their eyes are small or medium-sized, very prominent laterally and set widely apart on their triangular head with the piece of frontoclypeus anteriorly prominent. Its tymbal is completely covered with tymbal covering. By looking at the abdomen, the 8th tergum will appear much longer than the 7th tergum in median length. Their femurs on the forelegs have two big spines with several small spines on the ventral part of the forelegs. The operculum of males are longitudinal and overlapped each other but not exceeding the posterior margin of the third abdominal sternum. In most cases, the apex of the operculum is broadly rounded and can be obviously seen by the naked eye. exuvia (not C. ochracea) giving rise to a winged imago. Some of these species may have light green, earthy red or yellow (ochreous) coloured body. A transverse black fascia can be seen along its anterior head margin and black markings on margin of each ocellus near to its castaneous eyes. Their ventral side can appear powdery or scaly (pollinosity) white on a pale ochreous or pale green body surface. Similar to majority of other cicadas, their wings are translucent and glassy (hyaline) without any darkening marks or tinge (infuscation). A full adult cicada, or also known as an imago, can grow up to in body length for males, for female cicadas. Their total length however, can reach up to for male cicadas and for females. Cicadas of the genus Chremistica are placed in the tribe Tibicenini along with Tibicen Latreille, Cryptotympana St√•l, Anapsaltoda Ashton and Neopsaltoda Distant. According to entomologist Hayashi (1987), the genera under the tribe Tibicenini share the same sound-production characteristics, external morphology and male genitalia, allowing them to be classified under the same monophyletic group. alt= Regarding grouping, Chremistica ochracea is placed under the pontianaka group due to their external morphology similarity and characteristics of the male genitalia. The researchers have come to a conclusion that cicadas under the pontianaka group are absent with arc-shaped lateral clasper lobes. Their medial and lateral clasper lobes however, are well developed when compared to other cicada species.  Biology  alt= This species is commonly found in the lowlands and low montane areas of Taiwan China, the Oriental region (China) and America. Some are also seen in parts of Peninsular Malaysia. They are reported to be more abundant in plantation areas and fragmented forests of Taiwan China, but not much in continuous forests. C. ochracea cicadas are reported to emerge earlier than other cicada species that are found in the same areas, including their nymphs. This suggests that they are a highly adaptive species with a high survival rate. This is also consistent with their wide variety of use (as food source, habitat, exuviation process) in host plants, as they are less choosy as compared to other cicada species. Their exuviae (singular exuvia), which are the outer cast-off skin, can be found in large numbers after a rainy season. This due to the fact that the survival of hatching cicada eggs positively correlates to increasing humidity. The exuviae are usually found on barks of trees and the position or height above the ground is influenced by the size of the nymphs. It is suggested that nymphs with a larger body size have better water content thus allowing them to climb higher and longer with the advantage of reduced transpiration due to their smaller surface area to volume ratio. The adult species are actively found in April to September, where males will sing to attract the females around their area. The male singing sounds like a chorus, starting with one male then followed by the males in the nearby area, and the song will finish at the same time. This ritual usually happens in the evening, often during the early season. Adult cicadas are seen active during the day, usually spotted sitting on twigs in the month of June and July, and are known to be very attracted to light during night time, similar to the behaviour of moths and other flying insects at night. The chirping/buzzing sound is only produced by adult males and the sound is monotonous with a continuous buzzing. The male singing will normally last from tens of seconds to a few minutes and finishes at once.  Use in research  = Noise pollution = As cicadas use loud, distinct callings to attract their mates, they are sometimes used to study the impact of noise pollution to the wild. They are hypothesised to have adapted to the noise from urban environments (sounds produced by motor vehicles, industrial economy, constructions or even loud music), but more understanding of how anthropogenic noise affecting these insects are needed. A study was carried out by comparing the number of cicada species and measuring each of their calling activity pattern and acoustic features between the city areas and mountain areas of Taiwan China using automated digital recording systems. They found out that there are a lesser number of cicada species in the urban environment, which correlates to the higher levels of anthropogenic noise, as compared to the findings from the mountain site. This suggests that there are fewer species that can tolerate anthropogenic noise, thus more cicada species prefer to inhibit mountain areas than the city areas for a better chance of reproduction and survival. The lower number of species in the urban landscapes however, gives advantage to the cicadas in the urban environment as they experience lesser inter-specific masking affect, hence their songs are less likely to be overlapped, not heard or confused by the female cicadas. Although cicadas from the different environments experienced different anthropogenic and inter- specific noise pressures, they both possess close partitioning strategy. It is reported that there are low spectral overlap in both environments, thus partitioning the frequency domain are used by the cicadas to reduce the masking interference. = Mercury levels in soil = In another study, C. ochracea was collected to measure mercury levels in terrestrial subtropical forested systems (air, soil and biomass) in Southwest China. This is because insects can easily accumulate heavy metals in their body, due to their high surface area to volume ratio and ingesting food source that may already have been contaminated by heavy metal substances, which will then result in physiological toxicity and ecological stress. They found out that 99.4% of the total mercury pools from the ecosystem was accumulated in layers of soil. High pools of mercury in soil can endanger the atmospheric activity as more mercury can be released during potential wildfires. It is reported that a female cicada usually has a higher mercury level than the males due to having a smaller body mass and more concentrated mercury concentrations, but the mercury concentrations in both of the sexes in this research was significantly similar as there were no significant differences in body mass. They also argued that there are higher mercury levels in cicada (49¬±38 ng/g) as compared to longicorn (7¬±5 ng/g), due to the special life cycle of cicada; the larvae of cicadas can live for four to five years underground before they undergo their last molting and rely on sucking plant roots for survival, which may contain a relatively higher mercury levels than in wood or bark of the tree. Nevertheless, mercury levels recorded from dung beetles in this experiment were a lot times higher than both cicada and longicorn; 40 and 283 times higher, respectively. = Lead bio-accumulation = The forest ecosystem is in danger of the elevating levels of lead (Pb) in soils and biomass as lead can be deposited atmospherically. The sources of elevating levels of lead in terrestrial environments are known to come from both natural and anthropogenic activities, such as the use and production of lead batteries, gasoline combustion from motor vehicles, coal combustion, sintering and smelting of minerals. This can pose ecological threat to insects, the habitat that they are living in and their foraging habits since terrestrial forests are identified as large sinks of atmospheric lead. Similar to the mercury level in soil study, cicada larvae are collected and sampled within Tieshanping Forest Park and a protected area near Chongqing City, Southwest China to measure the bio-accumulation of lead concentration as they can live underground from four to up to five years long before appearing above ground and undergo their last stage of molting. The next life-cycle stage will require them to feed on sap of plants. It is worth noting that Chongqing is one of the important industrial areas in Southwest China which uses a large amount of fossil fuels. This may contribute to the higher levels of lead in the area and contaminate the surrounding environment. The average concentration of lead in the atmosphere was recorded at 149 ng/m¬≥ in 2012. The research showed that the lead concentration in the cicadas were lower than the known harmful level for invertebrates. The female cicadas are reported to have higher concentrations of lead than males, similar to the dung beetles in the study. However, it is known that cicada larvae have the ability to detoxify harmful substances, such as the removal of degenerated cells, producing metal-containing vesicles into the digestive tract for removal and exocytosis. This allows them to be more resilient to lead pollution in soil which increases their chance of survival. The research however, justified that there are concerning elevated levels of lead in dung beetles, which can negatively affect predators in food chains. This case is also known as biomagnification, which occurs when toxicity levels in a tolerant organism's tissue increase successively in a food chain. 500x500px  See also  In a paper, Chremistica ochracea is recognised under the pontianaka group, with some other genus Chremistica species. *Auchenorrhyncha *Biomagnification *Carl Linnaeus *Carl St√•l *Cicada *Exuviae *Francis Walker *Human impact on the environment *Imago *James John Walker *List of genus Chremistica species *List of Cicadidae genera *Noise pollution *Tymbal  References  Arthropods of Asia Cryptotympanini Insects described in 1850 ","title":"Chremistica ochracea"},{"id":"58456205","text":"NHL 19 is an ice hockey simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver and published by EA Sports.

Background Nurrachadiana was born in Bandung on 18 July 1980. After completing highschool in Bandung, she earned a bachelors in medicine from Maranatha Christian University and a masters in health law from Soegijapranata Catholic University. Nurrachadiana is divorced with one child. According to her, her name was based on the Toyota Celica car, which her parents bought in the year of her birth. Career Before holding political office, Nurrachadiana served as director in several companies. She also featured in the 2011 film Surat Kecil Untuk Tuhan, taking on a minor role as a doctor treating the main character. =Politics= After being elected to the West Java Provincial Council in the 2009 election, Nurrachadiana was sworn in on 31 August 2009. In 2010 local election, Nurrachadiana ran as a running mate to Ade Swara and won, securing 38.8% of the votes in a five-way race and defeating incumbent Sonny Gersona. They were sworn in on 27 December 2010, although Nurrachadiana's replacement in the council was not appointed until June the following year. When she was sworn in at the age of 30, she received an award from the Indonesian World Records Museum for being the youngest female vice-regent. After Ade was arrested and charged for corruption and money laundering, Nurrachadiana was made acting regent in 24 December 2014, and remained so until the end of her term in December 2015. In the 2015 local election, she secured a slim majority (51.06%, 533,240 votes) in the six- candidate race with Ahmad Zamaksyari as running mate. She was officially sworn in by governor Ahmad Heryawan on 17 February 2016. As regent, Nurrachadiana promoted vertical housing in the regency in order to reduce land use, with agricultural land already pressured by the expansion of industry. In 2018, she and her deputy entered a spat over the mutation of hundreds of regency officials, with the latter declaring an intent to run against her in the 2021 local election.

They are usually organised by Skat clubs or other local clubs.  Rules  All participants pay an entry fee which is used to fund prizes awarded at the end of the event. The competitions are played in accordance with Skat rules that are laid down in advance. A Preisskat should be played according to the International Skat Rules so that rules do not vary everywhere. These rules are those agreed jointly by the two biggest skat organisations, the German Skat Association (DSkV) and the International Skat Players Association (ISPA). At a Preisskat, the seating plan is either worked out in advance or determined by drawing lots or based on the points scored (from the second round onwards). In a solo game, the soloist has to pay a so- called Abreizgeld (disincentive fee) of about 0.50 ‚Ç¨ if he loses in addition to the entry fee. After losing more than a certain number of games (usually after the fourth) each game lost costs a higher amount (about 1.- ‚Ç¨). 'Passed' games may also be charged a penalty fee. The Abreizgeld usually goes into the cash box of the tournament organizer and is not redistributed again in the form of prizes. The winner of a tournament is the player who has scored the most points. In addition, there are often additional prizes for the best players in the women's, youth and senior categories. In addition to the mandatory individual competition, there may be other classifications within the scope of a Preisskat for which a separate entry fee is charged. As a rule, participation is optional and has no influence on the individual competition. The most common variants are team scoring (usually four players) and tandem or mixed scoring (two players). Preisskat is generally not classed as a gambling game within the meaning of section 284 of the relevant German law (StGB) and may therefore be played for money. This stems from the fact that Preisskat is a tournament game that has been taking place long enough to exclude categorisation as a game of chance.Annex to ¬ß5a of Gaming Regulations.

It is also known as The First Bank and The Barn Gallery. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The land consisting of numbers 10, 12 and 14 Jellore Street was purchased by John Keighran of Campelltown in 1834 and 1835. Under the terms of the sale a house was to be erected within 2 years of the 1834 sale. The house would have been completed by 1836 as ownership of the land remained with members of Keighran's family until 1882. It is often described as having been a bakery before its use as a bank, and was possibly the bakery of Dalley and Allen. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney were the first bank in Berrima, operating a local branch from 1866 to 1894. Although it operated out of multiple premises in the town, the Jellore Street building is by far the most well known, and is often referred to as \\"The First Bank\\". It was used as an antique shop in recent times, but is now a private residence. Description The former CBC Bank building is a single storey ashlar stone cottage in the Colonial Georgian style with a hipped roof. The main roof is continued over the front verandah which is also hip roofed. The two stone chimneys to each of the east and west elevations have simple raised neck moulds. The 2 front windows are 2 x 6 paned double hung sashes and have timber shutters. An upgraded extension (improving on 1974-5 extension of poor quality) was undertaken to the east side ( 2000) and a significant renovation and extension to the rear of the cottage took place in 2006. Significance The first bank is significant through its associations with the commercial development of Berrima from the early period of settlement when it was Berrima's first bank through to its use by the antique trade. It is now a private residence. It also has aesthetic significance as a good representative example in the context of the Southern Highlands, of an early \\"Colonial Georgian\\" style of stone cottage where the original form is relatively intact and much of the exterior original fabric remains. Together with other similar buildings in Berrima, it contributes to the historic character of the town as a whole and to the Jellore Street streetscape in particular.

The resulting scandal and trial that began in 1999 and ended in 2000. It has been described as one of the largest scandals ever in South Korea since the 1990s. Estimated loss from bribery and corruption related to the Furgate scandal was approximately $165 million. History The scandal surfaced in South Korea in May 1999 while prosecutors were investigating corruption charges related to the Shin Dong Ah company. Luxury items were used by wives of businessmen under investigation for corruption to gain favors of the wives of senior Korean politicians and judicial officials, in order to have those wives persuade their husbands towards leniency. The investigation into the scandal led to the first ever appointment of a special prosecutor in South Korea judicial history. Two ministers resigned over the scandal; a former Minister of Justice and a former presidential legal secretary were among the individuals arrested during the investigation. Individuals sentenced in the scandal included the wives of a former unification minister and of a former prosecutor general, found guilty of perjury before the Korean parliament (National Assembly). Impact The scandal was revealed in the midst of the Korean economic crisis related to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and led to moral outrage. The scandal damaged the reputation of Korean president Kim Dae-jung and his party (the Democratic Party), particularly when further information was revealed to suggest that the prosecutor office attempted to cover up the scandal.

The carvings on the rocks illustrates primitive men, ritual dances, men with lances in their hands, animals, bull fights, camel caravans, and picture of the sun and stars. The date of these carvings goes back to 5.000 ‚Äì 20.000 years before. Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape The Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape represents the history of humanity from the Upper Paleolithic era to the Middle Ages in Eurasia. It is situated at the south-east end of the Greater Caucasus ridge in Azerbaijan. it is located approximately 64 km away from center of Baku. The area of the site is 537 ha. The cultural landscape covers three rocky highlands in the semi-desert territory of central Azerbaijan. There are more than 6.000 rock engravings on more than 1.000 surfaces of rocks that reflects 40.000 years of history of rock art. During the archaeological excavation, 104 small-sized engraved stones were also discovered at different archaeological stages Petroglyphs in Gobustan dating about 5,000 to 8,000 years back contain longships similar to Viking ships. The discovery of ship illustrations among the rock paintings in Gobustan shows its relationship with the Mediterranean and the European continent. Jingirdag, Boyukdash, and Kichikdash mountains and Yazili hill are located in Gobustan, which are the home for the ancient rock art. Most of the rock carving can be found on the upper surface of Boyukdash and Kicikdash mountains. The paintings on the rock walls date back to 3-4 thousand years ago mainly reflect hunting scenes. Human (dancers, hunters, men wearing tropical helmets) and animal (deer and goat) paintings are depicted on the rocks of more sheltered sides. Images of animals on Gobustan rocks vary depending on the periods because of the change in the hunting targets (from big animals like aurochs and wild horses (during the Pleistocene period) to relatively smaller Holocene animals such as deer, wild boar and bird) according to the climate change starting at the beginning of the Holocene period. The petroglyphs on the walls of the living sites as ‚ÄúFiruz-1‚Äù, ‚ÄúFiruz-2‚Äù, ‚ÄúGaya-arasi‚Äù, ‚ÄúGaya-Arasi-2‚Äù on Kicikdash Mountain, ‚ÄúKaniza‚Äù, ‚ÄúAna-Zaga‚Äù on Boyukdash Mountain are similar to the petroglyphs on some stones in this site. One of the rocks has a Latin inscription belonging to the period of Roman Emperor Domitian‚Äôs reign (81-96 AD), which shows the temporary stay of the 12th Roman Legion led by Fulminate on the Caspian shores. Another remnant of the early time is so-called \\"gaval chalan dash\\" (tambourine stone), an ancient musical instrument described in Gobustan Rock Art. In 1996, by the decree of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR, the mountains were declared as Gobustan State Historical Artistic Preserve. By the decree of the president, the mountains were declared as National Reserve in 2007. For its quality and density of rock art engravings, Gobustan was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007. History The cultural landscape was firstly discovered by local miner in 1939-40.Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape. World Heritage Site Nomination Document The sticky drawings of the deer, goat and cattle dated between 12th and 8th centuries BC reflect the Neolithic period in Gobustan. Gobustan petroglyphs studied by Isak Jafarzadeh who analyzed approximately 750 rocks with more than 3.500 petroglyphs in 1947 and onwards were divided into 6 periods from ancient times to the Middle Ages: * Neolithic period (figures contain men and women drawings with arrow and bow on their shoulders), * Late Neolithic period (drawings of bison, boat, and archers), * Eneolithic period (big drawings of goats, lions and deer), * Bronze Age period (wild animals, horses and pigs drawings), * Iron Age period (man drawings, goats and deer figures, as well as Roman inscriptions) The Middle Ages (camel caravans drawings, a warrior with a weapon on his hand, symbols, Arabic and Persian inscriptions). Later on, F. Muradova and J. Rustamov made new discoveries of more than 1.500 images. During the archaeological excavation, numerous Bronze Age structures were found here. Those archaeological excavations were supported by the Institute of Archeological and Ethnography of the National Academy of Science of Azerbaijan. In 1966, 1988 and 2001, all discoveries of rock carvings and images were taken under state protection.

It is used as a food condiment and ingredient, both in paste and in powder form. Corn sauce, like soy sauce, has a characteristic savory taste. It is used to flavor dishes including soups, broths, and gravies. 293x293px alt=  Taste and usage  Corn sauce is a mix of free and bound amino acids, organic acids and their salts, Maillard reaction products, and minerals. Sensory analysis describes corn sauce with characteristic savory tastes including 'xian' (È≤ú in Chinese), umami, caramelized, roasted, slightly yeasty, meaty, salty, and sweet. The taste of corn sauces has been subject to research, showing that the complexity of the taste results from the composition of salts and fermentation metabolites, amino acids, acetic acid, ribotides, short peptides and carbohydrates. Additionally, glutamyl-dipeptides were identified as a class of enriching taste compounds. Sensory analysis result of corn sauce with a trained sensory panel The taste of corn sauce led to the usage as a condiment. Like yeast extract, soy sauce and hydrolyzed vegetable protein, it rounds off the flavor and taste.  Manufacturing process  Comparable to the production of soy sauce, corn sauce is obtained by fermentation, sometimes referred as brewing. The fermentation process is using Corynebacterium bacteria species. The fermentation parameters are controlled for time, temperature and pH. After fermentation the broth undergoes a cooking step to kill the fermenting microorganisms and to induce a controlled Maillard reaction. The cell mass is removed by filtration. The filtered broth is concentrated in order to obtain a paste and to create further Maillard products. During evaporation, salt is added to improve microbial stability. For a powdered product a drying step is applied. Production Flow Chart for Corn Sauce Production  Composition  Corn sauce contains a mix of compounds, including fermentation metabolites, amino acids, organic acids, minerals and salts. Flavor and color compounds are generated by Maillard reaction during the fermentation, cooking and drying process. Glutamic acid, alanine, and proline are the most abundant present amino acids. Other metabolites are ribotides, sugars, organic acids and Œ≥-glutamyl-dipeptides, which are known to have taste-modulating properties.  Labeling  On labels listed as ‚ÄúCorn sauce‚Äù or \\"Fermented corn sauce\\" listing the used ingredients (corn starch, water, salt).  Food safety  The fermentation of food with Corynebacterium species is widely present in many parts of the world. The global exposure to these microorganisms in food fermentations assures its safe use and acceptance for food production globally. The question of toxicity of corn sauce was negated by toxicological studies.

It was built in 1865-66 and closed for religious use in 2017. The former church is a Grade II* listed building. History Although non-conformity worship had been present at Stoke-sub-Hamdon as early as 1689, the lack of a purpose-built place of worship often resulted in inhabitants travelling to other neighbouring areas including South Petherton, Montacute, Bower Hinton and Martock. The glove manufacturer Mr. Richard Southcombe initiated plans for a church in 1865 by establishing a committee and subscription list to raise the necessary funds. The project was assisted by Samuel Morley, the MP for Nottingham and a large employer in the local area. A plot of land was leased from the Duchy of Cornwall for a period of 99 years and a nominal sum of 15s per year. Once ¬£1,000 had been reached, Mr. Southcombe hired Mr. Robert C. Bennett of Weymouth to draw up the plans for the church and Mr. Richard Reynolds was then hired as the builder. Once the foundations of the building were completed, the foundation stone was laid by Samuel Morley on 18 October 1865. The church's opening services were held on 6 September 1866. Those who took part in the opening services included Rev. S. Hebditch of Bristol, Rev. W. Densham of South Petherton, Rev. R. James of Yeovil, Rev. E. Paxton Hood of Brighton. The same day saw a dinner held for 300 people in the schoolroom. ¬£880 of the church's ¬£1,975 cost remained as debt at the time of its opening, but the majority was raised over the course of the day. Mr. Morley increased his subscription from ¬£300 to ¬£500 and Mr. Southcombe increased his from ¬£300 to ¬£600, with a further ¬£148 provided by various others in attendance. A minister's house and schoolroom was built adjacent to the church in 1869. Owing to the need of increased school accommodation, a schoolroom for infants was built in 1875-76. The church underwent renovation for ¬£400 in 1879. All seats and woodwork was cleaned and varnished, the walls repainted and the pulpit replaced by a rostrum. The church continued to serve until 2017, with the final service being held on 7 January.http://www.stoke-sub-hamdon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stoke- sub-Hamdon-Newsletter-January-2017.pdf Architecture The church is built of Hamstone, sourced from nearby Ham Hill, with a roof of Welsh slate. It was designed in the Decorated Gothic style, with similar features to the Congregational Church at South Petherton, which Bennett also designed. The church's open seats of stained wood were able to accommodate 350 persons. A 90-feet-high tower and spire is located on the south-east corner of the building.

She was the first female professor at Murdoch University, Perth, and its first professor of sociology.  Biography  Cora Baldock was born Corrie Vellekoop, on 16 December 1935 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. She grew up with relatives who worked in academia, which influenced her decision to study sociology at Leiden University, from which she graduated cum laude in 1960. Her master's thesis was on stratification in women's occupations. As an undergraduate, she mentor to Princess, later Queen, Beatrix of the Netherlands. She obtained her PhD from the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Baldock married in 1970, and has two children.  Career  Following her PhD, Baldock moved to the US, teaching at San Diego State College, California and Bernard Baruch College at the City University of New York. She was a senior lecturer at Australian National University before becoming Murdoch University's first female professor and first professor of sociology, where she worked for 22 years. She was president of the Australian Sociological Association from 1979 to 1980, and founded the association's Jean Martin award committee. Baldock was a member of the Federal Government‚Äôs Multicultural Advisory Committee in the 1990s. Her research interests are in the sociology of work, women's studies, and the intersection of gender and social policy. She has highlighted and redressed in her work the lack of differentiation by sex in sociological analyses of class stratification. Her study Volunteers in Welfare (1990) was an influential analysis of the resurgence of volunteering and the voluntary sector, and the tension between volunteering as a low-cost provision of social welfare and as a means of individual self-development for volunteers. In it, Baldock argues volunteer work represents the features of a capitalist state and the patriarchy, by fulfilling their economic and ideological functions and maintaining their status quo.

He was largely responsible for its antiquated layout and use of English spelling; then he became the first BBC employee to edit the Radio Times. Early life Walter Fuller was born in 1881 to Walter Henry and Elizabeth Fuller. After studying medicine at Owen's College, Manchester, and failing to get his degree in 1904, Fuller edited the University Review, Comradeship (for the Co-operative Holidays Association and the National Home Reading Union), and the Reader's Review (for the Library Association and National Home Reading Union). By 1910, they were all either defunct or on the brink of closure. Managing The Fuller Sisters Fuller had one older sister, Oriska Violet (Fuller) Ward, and three younger ones; Rosalind Ivy Fuller, Cynthia Rose (Fuller) Dehn, and Dorothy Daisy (Fuller) Odell. He was very close to them all. The eldest, Oriska, had studied the harp (plus the piano and singing) at the Royal College of Music; the younger ones were largely home-schooled. After their singing of folksongs was noticed -- and highly praised by Cecil Sharp ‚Äì the three eldest girls decided to chance their luck as folksingers in America, with Oriska accompanying them and Walter as their manager. Such was their success that within six months they were invited to sing at the White House, but their schedule was already too full to fit that in before they left for home. On subsequent tours, they sang twice for President Wilson, once at the White House and once at his summer residence, Shadowlawn.Winnington, chapter 3 By 1917, \\"The Fuller Sisters\\" were famous, recognized and stopped in the streets for their signatures. Then the entry of the US into the First World War put an end to the demand for folksongs. Activism and career as an editor By this time, Fuller had become a peace activist, married Crystal Eastman, and was masterminding the anti-war propaganda campaign of the New York branch of the Woman's Peace Party. He conceived and mounted a pioneering \\"War Against War\\" exhibition (commemorated in a 2017 exhibition), ideas for which were used by the Creel Committee to serve the opposite purpose of making America want to go to war.Winnington, chapter 5 He worked closely with Norman Thomas to edit The World Tomorrow, and brought the concept of civil liberties to the Civil Liberties Bureau, out of which grew the American Civil Liberties Union. After working on The Freeman in New York, he returned to England, was recruited by the newly formed BBC and became the first BBC employee to edit Radio Times.Winnington, chapter 10 He died in September 1927 of high blood pressure, caused by overwork. His wife, Crystal Eastman, died eight months later. They left two small children, Jeffrey Fuller and Anice Fuller. (It was at this time that his sister Rosalind moved to England to develop the acting career she had been pursuing in the USA.)

It shows a village scene where people skate on a frozen river, while on the right among trees and bushes, birds gather around a bird trap. It has become known as the original or oldest exemplar of the most successful painting of the Brueghel family dynasty, since the art historian Klaus Ertz documented 127 copies in his comprehensive monograph on the artist's son in 2000.Klaus Ertz, Pieter Brueghel der J√ºngerer (1564-1637/8): Die Gem√§lde mit kritischem oeuvrekatalog, Luca verlag Lingen, 2000 Of the 127 documented copies in 2000, Ertz lists 45 as by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, 51 doubtful, and 31 rejected-but-notable, and all of these were created in the 17th century. Since 2000 the discussion has not stopped and possibly this painting employs motifs from some earlier lost original by Jan Brueghel the Elder, along the lines of The Hunters in the Snow.Sotheby's record for exemplar sold 30 January 2014 for 2,741,000 USD Each known copy seems to emphasize subtle details, whether it is in the game of curling, the arrangement of the bird trap, the hole in the ice, or various moralistic and religious themes. Two copies documented by Ertz depict the Rest on the Flight into Egypt. The variation of motifs and their popularity in the copies has led to much speculation and comparison of contemporary engravings and the later popularity of the winter landscape as its own art genre, which enabled painters such as Hendrick Avercamp to build a business around painting them.

It is the third and last installment of the Iron Soldier series. Set after the events of the second game, players assume the role of an elite defense pilot taking control of the titular mech in order to complete tasks and protect areas that conforms the United Republic from attacks of the returning PENTA corporation. Iron Soldier 3 was conceived after release of the second entry and originally intended to be an exclusive first-party title by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation before the deal was cancelled, leading to both Vatical Entertainment and Telegames handling publishing duties instead while VM Labs published the Nuon port, with the two versions featuring various differences. Versions for PlayStation 2 and Xbox were in development but not released. Iron Soldier 3 garnered mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release on the PlayStation and later on Nuon, with many feeling divided in regards to several aspects such as the visuals, audio, presentation and gameplay, which was deemed by some as sluggish and comparing with other titles in the same genre such as Armored Core and Gungriffon.  Gameplay  PlayStation version screenshot. Iron Soldier 3 is a mech simulation game with free-roaming elements that is primarily played in a first-person perspective like its predecessors, where the player controls a robot to defend the United Republic, one of the last free countries left in a futuristic world from PENTA Industries, a large corporation that became powerful with the rapid industrialization of the world. There are several weapons to be found through the game such as machine guns, missiles, grenades and a flamethrower, among others to be collected and use. In addition to the standard titular robot, the player can pilot new mechs such as a smaller but faster chicken-walker type robot and a slower but more heavily armed walker. New gameplay modes have been added since Iron Soldier 2; although a single player campaign mode with 25 missions to complete was still included, there is also an arcade mode where the objective is to level every building in the area in the fastest time possible, in addition of a two-player mode.  Development  After Iron Soldier 2 was launched for the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD, Eclipse Software Design founder Marc Rosocha began conversations with Sony Computer Entertainment in regards of developing for the PlayStation while former Atari Corporation vice president in third-party development Bill Rehbock, who was now part of Sony, managed to send development kits to Eclipse Software. Rosocha stated that Eclipse was very close in obtaining a deal to publish Iron Soldier 3 as a first-party title but said deal was cancelled at the last minute, leading to the company signing another deal with both Vatical Entertainment and Telegames instead to handle publishing duties on PlayStation while a conversion for the Nuon was developed for VM Labs as well, which was overseen by former Atari Corp. employee Joe Sousa as its producer. When developing Iron Soldier 3, Rosocha and his team wanted to retain the series' established core gameplay and mechanics from the Jaguar that led criticism from reviewers for being slow. The title made use of a proprietary game engine that featured several advanced special effects not commonly seen on the system. The CGI cutscenes were created by Johannes Graf, who would later go on to develop Sturmwind for Dreamcast.  Release  Iron Soldier 3 was launched for the PlayStation in North America by Vatical Entertainment on 20 June 2000, and later in Europe by Telegames during the same year. The game was published for the Nuon by VM Labs in 2001 as one of the eight games for the platform, but it was recalled at one point due to incompatibility with some DVD players, leading to the publisher releasing an estimated low run of demo discs being sent to the userbase of the system. This version of the game features improved visuals and audio compared to the original PlayStation version, as well as other changes and additions. Once the game was published in western regions, Eclipse was approached by a Japanese publisher to localize the game in the region, however, Rosocha declined the offer due to the proposed decision of making it play faster and enable mechs to fly. A new version of the game titled Iron Soldier 3+ was in development for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox but it was cancelled.  Reception  Iron Soldier 3 received mixed reception since its release.

It is reputed to be the first wooden stone house built in Berrima. The wooden settee on the verandah of Berrima House is noteworthy as a reputed resting place of Ben Hall, who is said to have slept there in 1864.LEP, 2010  Description  Berrima House is a two-storey random coursed stone building (rendered under verandah on ground floor and marked out in stone work joints). It has a single storey verandah to front elevation with timber posts, scalloped valance and flagged sandstone floor. The ground floor contains three rooms, along with a non-original kitchen extension, while the upper floor has four rooms accessed by the original timber staircase. The windows have stone lintels and sills. All original sash windows have been replaced, along with the front door. It features a hipped roof with boxed eaves and cedar board lining. The house is set among large deciduous trees and has a fine hedge across the street frontage. The verandah has possibly been replaced and the original outbuildings removed. Significance Berrima House is significant through associations with the local community of Berrima and as an early representative of the development of the town generally and its more substantial residences in particular. A building valued by the local community as one of the earliest substantial residences in Berrima and still retaining in its overall form and some original detailing characteristic of Colonial- Georgian townhouses.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The site is now home to Dotty's Feed and Pet Supply; the original elevator buildings are no longer extant. History In 1861, the Pere Marquette Railroad laid tracks through Clio. Putnam Mauk, realizing that the location was ripe for the transport of agricultural products from the surrounding area, constructed a grain elevator alongside the tracks soon after the railway was completed. Some time later, Mauk took on a partner, a Mr. Hammer. In 1880, Fred Mark purchased the elevator and enlarged it. Around 1900, longtime employee F. M. Houghton purchased the elevator and further enlarged it, creating a facility with a capacity of 40,000 bushels of grain. Houghton owned the elevator until his death in 1948, when it was passed on to his son Richard Houghton. Richard owned and operated the elevator until he retired and sold it in 1981. During the family's ownership, the elevator also handled large amounts of produce and locally produced building materials, such as bricks, mortar, and cement, as they were loaded onto freight cars through the elevator. After its sale, the elevator was used as a retail outlet. Description The Houghton Elevator was a wood~framed elevator consisting of a series of rectangular components joined together in a linear configuration.

Joseph Peeris and Ruth Peeris. She is the eldest of 6 girls. She received primary education at Little Flower Convent in Bandarawela, an agricultural city in the Badulla District from 1949 to 1953. From 1954 to 1964, she attended secondary school, corresponding to middle and high school,Gunatilleke, S. (2018, November 4). Personal interview. at St. Bridget's Convent in Colombo, the largest city and commercial capital of the island.  Education  In 1965, she began attending the University of Ceylon in Colombo, the only university in Sri Lanka at the time. In 1967 she transferred to the Peradeniya location. By 1969, Gunatilleke graduated First Class Honours with a Special Degree in Botany. She was the second person to qualify for this degree and the first woman. She also earned a subsidiary degree in Chemistry. Shortly after graduation, in 1970, she began teaching as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Botany at the University of Ceylon in Peradeniya. Initially, Gunatilleke was planning on teaching plant pathology, the study of organisms and environmental conditions that cause disease in plants. However, upon receiving the position, the head of the Botany Department, Professor Abeywickrama, told her the department already had a plant pathologist and she would be teaching Forest Ecology, shifting the direction of her academic career. In 1971, Gunatilleke was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship and moved to the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, United Kingdom for postgraduate education where she earned her master's degree in general ecology and a Ph.D. in Tropical Forest Ecology and Conservation. While in Peradeniya, she had been inspired by a presentation from Peter Ashton, a prominent tropical forest expert, on ‚ÄúSri Lanka‚Äôs lowland forests‚Äù to study forests and land use issues. She was impressed not only with his knowledge of the tree family he was in Sri Lanka to study, but also his knowledge of the island's geography, roads, and waterways. She wrote to several plant ecologists in the US and UK, including Peter Ashton. Again, Abeywickrama would have an influential role in guiding her path; he suggested she be trained under Ashton because he wanted to strengthen the topic Ashton was offering in his botany department. Gunatilleke did choose to study with Ashton for her Ph.D. Her thesis, ‚ÄúEcology of the Endemic Tree Species of Sri Lanka concerning their Conservation‚Äù is considered a landmark project in quantitative ecological research. The study revealed that a great proportion of endemic tree species were confined to Sri Lanka's lowland rain forests and highlighted the need to conserve them. This research required one year of fieldwork in 6 lowland primary forests in Sri Lanka: Kottawa, Kanneliya and Gilimale (wet zones), Daragoda and Barigoda (intermediate zones), and Ritigala (dry zone).Gunatilleke, S. (2018, November 2). Email. Although she pursued education outside of Sri Lanka, Gunatilleke planned on spending her career in her home country. Her father's encouragement to \\"return to the island to serve [her] motherland\\" played a role in her commitment of to not letting knowledge leave her country. She has stated one of her proudest accomplishments is avoiding the \\"brain drain\\".  Career and research  Since 1977, Gunatilleke's main research focused in the Sinharaja rain forest. This forest is located in southwest Sri Lanka and the country's last area of primary tropical rain forest large enough to be sustainable. More than 60% of the tree species are endemic, as are many wildlife, especially birds. In this forest, she investigated the value of tree species diversity. Her work contributed to declaring the Sinharaja rain forest a World Heritage Site in October 21, 1988. This was important as the area was still being logged by the State Timber Corporation in the 1970s at the time of her research. Her research also included recommendations on how to improve conservation in the Sinharaja. For one project, they looked at conditions required for growth to enable nearby villagers to grow tree species in the buffer zone around the protected area so they could continue to use forest resources. Another component focused on planting canopy species in the degraded peripheral areas of the forest to help encourage recruitment of species outside of the preserve. The third main component of their research looked into reconnecting fragmented patches to increase their chance of survival. She has also conducted research in Kanneliye Rainforest Reserve, Hiniduma, Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, and the Knuckles Forest Reserve. As a professor, she was also uniquely influential. She had finished her undergraduate studies without visiting a forest and was still a novice with identifying plants in the field when she started her Ph.D., so she wanted to give her students a chance to visit the ‚Äúoutdoor laboratories‚Äù Sri Lanka has to offer. She convinced the University of Peradeniya of the importance of field classes and encouraged the school to devote resources to including field work into curriculums. Additionally, she and her colleagues established an arboretum and herbarium for students so specimens from around the island would be available for them to study. She was also involved with exchange programs with other universities. She was an adviser for students visiting Sri Lanka on exchange programs with Harvard University, Yale University, and Aberdeen University. She particularly enjoyed interacting with students and seeing their responses to what she taught them. For example, one of the most rewarding parts of teaching for Gunatilleke was when a student understood a topic they had been struggling with. Of the classes she taught, she most enjoyed field classes due to the greater interaction with students. Since retiring, she has been involved with training government officers, NGOs, local and foreign student groups interested in forest biology and ecology.

It was built from 1833 to 1841. It is also known as the Royal Mail Coach Inn. It traded in recent times as a now-closed bed and breakfast known as the Coach and Horses Inn; however, that name historically referred to a different Berrima hotel. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Berrima is the second oldest (European) settlement in the Wingecarribee Shire and the oldest continuing settlement in the shire. The first town settlement in the district was in 1821 at Bong Bong, 8 km south- east of Berrima on the Wingecarribee River. The site of Berrima was selected by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1829 on a visit planning the route for a new road alignment from Sydney to replace the old Argyle Road, which had proven unsatisfactory due to a steep hill climb over the Mittagong Range and river crossing at Bong Bong. In 1830 Mitchell instructed Robert Hoddle to mark out the town based on a plan Mitchell's office prepared, along the lines of a traditional English village (with a central market place and as many blocks as possible facing onto the Wingecarribee River), and using the local Aboriginal name. The new line of road came through the town. Berrima was to be established as the commercial and administrative centre for the County of Camden. Following the approval of Governor Bourke in 1831, the period 1824 to 1841 saw significant flourishing development as mail coaches changed their route to this new line of road. Early town lots were sold in 1833, predominantly to innkeepers and around Market Square. In March 1833, Bryan McMahon (occasionally recorded as MacMahon) purchased the site of the Coach and Horses Inn, along with the adjoining site of the Berrima Inn (also known as McMahon's Inn). McMahon was an innkeeper from Sutton Forest. Both lots are located at the eastern corner of Bryan and Jellore Streets.Webb, 2008, 5, 10 It is understood that the building was built by a Mr. Matthews during McMahon's ownership. It operated under the sign of the (Royal) Mail Coach Inn, from 1837-9, as a licensed public house and staging post for travel and delivery of mail, run by licensee Michael Doyle. This was one of the first inns to operate in Berrima, along with the Surveyor-General Inn and the Berrima Inn (next door on Lot 1 Section 2). Doyle transferred the (Royal) Mail Coach Inn's liquor licence to the opposite side of Market Square in 1839 to operate from the property he and his wife had purchased, which is now known as the White Horse Inn. The recent use of the \\"Coach and Horses Inn\\" name for this property is misleading. Research has revealed that the Coach & Horses Inn never operated from this site. The original Coach and Horses Inn) licence, granted to Lewis Levy in 1856, was located on the corner of Oxley Street and Argyle Street (the Old Hume Highway), a building now known as Bramber Cottage. Since 1839 when the (Royal) Mail Coach Inn liquor licence was transferred, the Coach & Horses Inn property has been maintained as a private residence.Webb, 2008, 15 Bryan and his wife Winifred McMahon mortgaged Lot 2 Section 2 to William Morrice of Comfort Hill in April 1850, two days before Bryan died. In 1841 Morrice had taken up the half share of his brother John's grant from Reverend Doctor John Dunmore Lang, where he built Comfort Hill (farm homestead). This house was regarded as a twin house to \\"Eling Forest\\" opposite on the Great South Road (now the Hume Highway).Webb, 2008, 11 Bryan Patrick McMahon (son of Bryan) had inherited Lots 1 & 2 Section 2 and in 1862 sold both lots containing the original Berrima Inn and the stone and brick building to Francis Breen. Governor Bourke executed the inn's land grant in 1862, transferring it to Francis Breen, innkeeper. Breen was already a previous innkeeper having owned Breen's Commercial Hotel in Berrima in 1840Allman Johnston, 2007, 13(since renamed the Colonial Inn, the Old Breen's restaurant and currently named \\"Eschalots\\" restaurant). In 1863 a map of Berrima noted the property was in the possession of B. MacMahon. The will of Francis Breen, executed by the Supreme Court in 1870, bequeathed 'the house and premises known as McMahon's house situated in Market Square' to his brother Edward Breen. In 1885 Edward sold it to Sutton Forest farmer John Sewell Sr. and in 1887 he sold it to Percy Hiram Matthews, a clerk of Berrima In October 1947 Matthews, described as a retired bank officer, sold it to Mrs Nellie Clinton, wife of Joseph Erin Clinton, Berrima State Works secretary. Three months later Joseph Clinton died in Moss Vale and was buried in Berrima cemetery. In 1888 an eastern extension was added to the Mail Coach Inn residence, with a Victorian bay window facing Jellore Street. A new extension at the residence's rear forms the house's kitchen and bathroom.Webb, 2008, 20, 22 Nelly Clinton continued to live in the house until shortly before her death in 1970, with her son Joseph Basil Clinton and family living next door at the old Berrima Inn. In 1969 Nellie Clinton sold the property to Robert Glenn, a truck driver of Colo Vale. It was sold to Brian Thomas Timmis, a builder from Loftus, in 1988. During the ownership of Timmis, three new buildings were built on the site. Photographs of the property in a \\"For Sale\\" advertisement show all buildings now on site were there in 1989. The advertisement notes the property had been recently restored and was operating as a commercial venture for accommodation.Allman Johnston, 2007; corrected by Webb, 2008, 12-13 The property developed into use as a commercial residential business as a bed and breakfast operation in the late 1980s during the ownership of Brian Timmis. In June 1988 its title was converted by the then Land Titles Office to the now Lot 1 DP 780565. The property was renamed \\"Coach & Horses Inn\\" in the 1980s by the developer who was restoring it. In 1990 the property was transferred to Lesley Bensley, a receptionist of Burradoo. In July 2002 it was sold to David and Wendy Paley.Allman Johnston, 2007, 36 The Coach and Horses Inn bed and breakfast is no longer in operation.  Description  =Site and grounds= The former Mail Coach Inn and adjacent Berrima Inn play a significant role in and contribute to the streetscape of the Jellore Street / Berrima Market Square precinct. The inns contribute to the predominantly Colonial/Victorian Georgian architecture of the Berrima village and the Jellore Street precinct.Webb, 2008 The site forms part of the Jellore Street group of early cottages. It lies generally in a north-south orientation on the northern side of Berrima Market Square on a gentle north-sloping site between Jellore Street and the Wingecarribee River. It comprises a cluster of buildings near the street behind a picket fence, with a gravel car parking area on the front western side, a brick paved courtyard behind the inn, a lawn area between the cottage outbuilding (former kitchen) and stone outbuilding to its rear, a garden area with trees sloping down to the north to a fence and gate and the Wingecarribee River at its north. The building group is connected by brick and stone paving, surrounded by small gardens (garden beds) and native trees, grouped in rolling lawns to the north. There is a view to the Berrima Gaol from the rear of the property. Well maintained gardens and vegetation fall to the northern boundary, fence and gate leading down steeper grassed banks to the river. Situated also on the site are various trees, freestanding storage building (former outdoor privy) and vegetable gardens.Allman Johnston, 2007, 11 A 1930 aerial photograph shows there are no mature trees or significant (sized) garden (elements) on the site. It is not until the 1969 aerial photograph that any trees (an apple and a poplar, both still on site)Webb, 2008, 29 are evident on the site, indicating that almost all vegetation is less than 40 years old.Webb, 2008, 17 The garden is predominantly a modern installation (post 1969/1988) with only few trees displaying maturity, including an apple (Malus domestica cv.) north of Dandarbong cottage and a Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra 'Italica') on the western boundary north of Daphne cottage. Other trees within the common area are young eucalypts, wattles, poplars and seedling Prunus sp. to the north of the building group, and three deciduous trees adjacent to the entrance to the car park.Webb, 2008, 17, 51 The gardens between the buildings and Jellore Street are typically cottage in style with use of lavender, apple blossom (Escallonia sp.) and Abelia grandiflora as hedges. Exotic trees and shrubs such as Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) and Iowa crabapple (Malus ioensis) provide seasonal interest and maintain the landscape character and connection to the Jellore Street-scape and the exotic Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) planting of the Market Square opposite. The outdoor privy is evident in all the aerial photographs however during the 1988 building works it was rebuilt using recycled stone. All other buildings on site were erected during the Timmis ownership from 1988-90. Paths, driveways, fences and paved areas were also added during this time. The new plantings on site, including the semi-mature trees, were added after the 1988 renovations.Webb, 2008, 17, 20, 29-30, 51 =Buildings= There were 6 buildings on site as of 2007, being: Inn The original inn building is a single-storey, 6 room cottage, built in three stages from the 1830s, 1850s and 1880s. This has a strong connection to Berrima Market Place primarily due to its proximity to the street and high visibility from many locations in the Market Place. The setback of the original residence places the building behind the setback of the two neighbouring properties, Berrima Inn and Victoria Inn.Webb, 2008, 23 The exterior is brick rendered marked out in stone joints, with 12 pane single hung sash windows.National Trust, 1974 The painted, cement-rendered masonry is ruled to resemble ashlar stone. The asymmetrical front elevation features a hipped roofed projecting wing to east and with unusual angled bay window (with small roof-hood over). The remainder of the front elevation has a skillion roofed verandah supported on square timber posts. The indows to front are 2 x 6 pane single hung sashes. The main roof is half gabled and clad in corrugated steel.LEP, 1990 It is internally divided into 6 rooms, consisting of lounge room, two bedrooms, bathroom, dressing room and kitchen. All are contained within the footprint of the original 1856 building which shows evidence of significant degree of footprint and internal fabric intactness that has received modification and intrusive elements and materials to the 3 rear rooms over years of ownership.Allman Johnston, 2007, 10 The laundry is located externally and under an added skillion roof. All living areas have been renovated in the last 20 years, with new plaster ceilings, cove cornice, plastered and painted walls and painted skirting boards. Living and bed rooms have timber floors, with permanent or occasional carpets. Inn cottage to rear of inn 1856 cottage outbuilding (former kitchen block). Freestanding single storey simple room in brick with symmetrial hipped corrugated iron roof and close eaves. Brick is rendered. Exhibits significant fireplaces and together with its footprint still confirms the original intactness of the former kitchen which served the inn. These were traditionally detached. The western facade is punctured by two windows and a timber door arranged symmetrically. Currently linked by a more recent flat roof addition and laundry cupboard extension. Sandstone outbuilding to rear of inn cottage Freestanding storage building (former outdoor privy). Reconstructed and renovated in 1988, using materials excess to building needs for the two cottages. Internal walls rendered and new toilet installed.Webb, 2008, 27 Modern outbuildings ;1988 double weatherboard garage (to rear (north) of Stone outbuilding, on eastern boundary): Double garage of treated pine pole supports timber framed and weatherboard gabling with a metal gabled roof. Shows evidence of a reconstruction from a previous dilapidated garage and is evidence of refurbishing in the last 15 years. Built using recycled materials by Brian Timmis in 1988.Allman Johnston, 2007, 27 ;1988 weatherboard cottage (south-west of Inn, in middle of block) 'Dandenong (DandarbongWebb, 2008) Cottage'; Constructed in the style of an early timber weatherboard cottage in a rudimentary (simple, rectangular) form as it contains no internal wall or ceiling linings with all frame work exposed. Gabled corrugated iron roof running east-west. Internal finishes include painted and stained exposed timber beams and studs, with a polished timber floor. Surrounded by a corrugated iron roofed verandah on the south-west and north,) which links it to \\"Daphne\\" cottage. ;1988 2 storey brick barn (south-west of inn on western boundary) 'Daphne Cottage': Although the setback for Daphne cottage is behind the line of the early buildings, the height of the cottage gives it a dominant presence when viewed from the street. The north-south orientation and tall two storey gabled roof that addresses the street is in contrast to all other buildings that can be viewed from Jellore Street. Brick two-storey simple rectangular structure with a gable roof running north-south. The southern facade is of dressed stone work and through its construction materials and finishes indicates its construction during the 1988-90 period. Comprises a large single ground floor room timber framed boxed corner bathroom with timber stairs leading to a large attic bedroom. The ground floor with finishes of exposed brick and timber floors accommodates a living area and kitchen. The timber staircase leads to a carpeted single bedroom, leading out to a northern timber deck overlooking the Wingecarribee River.

It is not until the 1969 aerial photograph that any trees (an apple and a poplar, both still on site) are evident on the site, indicating that almost all vegetation is less than 40 years old.Webb, 2008, 17, 29 * 1979 A sketch of the site includes a picket fence and an entrance timber pergola, the original stone boundary fence to the east, and a water tank and small tree to the rear of the house (both now removed).Webb, 2008, 17, 20, 29 * Pre-1988: eastern rubble brick wall patched. The stone boundary wall between the house and Jellore Street is the only remnant of the early built elements in the landscape. This wall was reconstructed in 1988 using material from the original wall located along this fence line. To allow this wall to be read as a reconstructed element, it was constructed as a coarsed stone wall in contrast to the original random rubble wall that matched the house. * 1988-90 (Timmis ownership) ** Additions to the rear as outbuildings; modern picket fence to front elevation. ** Early aerial photographs show a cluster of buildings on the site, including the original privy, a garden shed and chook house. All these buildings were removed or reconstructed during the building works of 1988. The garden was also extensively renovated, with the northern garden sculpted into rolling mounds and planted to fast-growing native trees, including gums and wattles. New stone and brick paths were installed to link each of the new buildings, and fences erected to provide privacy between buildings. ** Refurbished original residence, re-roofed eastern section. NB: during refurbishment, the arrangement of the roof timbers indicated the original portion of the house was the western bedroom. The loungeroom and fireplace had been added later, followed by the eastern bedroom that had the inscription \\"1888\\" engraved in one of the roof beams. ** Two cottages/garage ('Dandenong' (Dandarbong',Webb, 2008, 5, 29 replacing an earlier garage*Webb, 2008, 5, 17, 29 and \\"Daphne\\" are the cottages) built on western side of the property to service the tourism industry. Daphne's materials included front facade stone sourced from the Sydney Museum. ** The original driveway swept in from Jellore Street to the garage, located to the north-west of the freestanding kitchen building. By the 2001 aerial photograph the driveway and car park had been realigned to occupy the area west of the house, with no driveway access to the rear of the property. ** Installation of recycled stone paving linking the two cottages, sourced from the Sydney Museum when it was undergoing renovations and reconstruction. ** Various other paths and edging were added to the vegetable patch, the stone from the Sydney Museum source again.

The new plantings on site, including the semi-mature trees, were added after the 1988 renovations.Webb, 2008, 5, 17, 20, 29 Elements in the garden installed since 1988 include: * reconstruction of the picket fence along Jellore Street, entrance pergola and pedestrian gate; * concrete path to front verandah and concrete paving under clothesline; * the driveway and car park area surfaced with decomposed granite; * a treated timber (pine) lattice fence installed separating the car park from the new buildings, a timber picket fence enclosing the clothes line to the north of the original kitchen and a post-and-rail fence to the north along the Wingecarribee River; * stone retaining edge around the compost and vegetable garden using recycled blocks of sandstone; * stone paths between the cottages using recycled blocks of sandstone sourced during building works at the Museum of Sydney; * recycled clay bricks and paving creating the paths and paved areas between buildings; * the wood shed.  Heritage listing  The former (Royal) Mail Coach Inn is significant through associations with the local community of Berrima and as a somewhat architecturally unusual component of the town's stock of early buildings. The building is also a component of the Jellore Street group, though it varies from the usual form of its neighbours with its asymmetrical front layout and other features such as half-gabled roof.LEP, 1990, modified viz correct historic name of the inn - Stuart Read, 15/1/2014 Mail Coach Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The French military mission to Romania was a mission led by led by General Berthelot, and sent from France to help Romania during World War I. French officers, aviators and medical staff trained and supported the Romanian army. As the Bolshevik took power in Russia and began negotiations for ending hostilities, Romania signed an armistice in December 1917 and sent the military mission back to France.  Background  Romania entered the war on the side of the Allies in August 1916. Joffre's first choice to head the French military mission was General de Langle de Cary, but the suggestion was rejected by the French Minister there, Charles de Saint Aulaire. Instead, Berthelot was appointed, arriving at Ia»ôi on 15 October and formally taking up his position the next day. Central Powers forces under General von Falkenhayn had already broken through the Transylvanian passes on 11 October, and swiftly conquered Wallachia and Dobruja.Greenhalgh 2014, p.160  Activities  Just as France had reconstituted the Serbian Army (now based at Salonika) after her conquest in the winter of 1915-16, between January and June 1917 Berthelot supervised the reorganisation and retraining of the Romanian Army. The men travelled through Norway, Sweden and Russia by train to reach Romania. The military mission was built up to almost 400 officers and 1,000 men.. 74 75mm guns were sent (with another 102 \\"under consideration\\") and 120 old 120L heavy guns, but Britain was asked to supply howitzers.Greenhalgh 2014, p.160 Greenhalgh does not say if Britain actually supplied any. Medical staff helped fight typhus and trained the Romanian staff to use modern techniques in both radiology and surgery..  Results  On the way home from his visit to St Petersburg in early 1917, shortly before the Fall of the Tsar, General de Castelnau stopped off for talks with Berthelot, and was told that the Romanian army could not be ready before 15 May.Greenhalgh 2014, p.181 Greenhalgh writes that their meeting was in Bucharest, which appears to be an error, as Bucharest had fallen to the Central Powers at the start of December 1916. In August 1917 Foch sent General Albert Niessel (a Russian speaker and formerly commander of IX Corps), on a mission to Russia (by then a republic under the Provisional Government) in the hope of repeating Berthelot's success there.Greenhalgh 2014, p.258 By summer 1917 Romania had reconstituted ten fully equipped divisions and had five more needing only artillery. Berthelot lobbied successfully for more munitions and 100 medics to defeat the spread of typhus.Greenhalgh 2014, p.256 The results of the reorganisation and resupply of the Romanian troops were seen in August 1917, when Alexandru Averescu's army broke the front at MƒÉrƒÉ≈üti. The Central Powers' major counter-offensive under Mackensen, aiming to occupy the rest of Romania (Moldavia) and the port of Odessa, was stopped at MƒÉrƒÉ≈üe≈üti and Oituz. US Army Chief of Staff General Hugh Scott praised Berthelot as ‚Äúa brilliant general‚Äù.Greenhalgh 2014, p.256  Aftermath  However, when the Bolsheviks began negotiations to take Russia out of the war, Romania, surrounded by the Central Powers, decided to sign an armistice on 9 December 1917, followed by a peace treaty on 7 May 1918. The French military mission had to leave the country. At Berthelot's suggestion, Britain and France issued a statement that Romania had fought hard and had been overcome by circumstances beyond her control and that the imposed peace treaty would be disregarded by the Allies.Greenhalgh 2014, p. 347-8  References   Bibliography  * Romania in World War I Military operations of World War I involving France France‚ÄìRomania relations ","title":"French military mission to Romania (1916‚Äì1918)"},{"id":"58458373","text":"Aspergillus elegans is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus.

The Aral sea is an example of a collapsed ecosystem. (image source: NASA) Subtropical broadleaf forests disappeared from Easter Island, the island is currently mostly covered in grassland with nga'atu or bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus tatora) in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau An ecosystem is considered collapsed when its unique biotic (characteristic biota) or abiotic features are lost from all previous occurrences. Ecosystem collapse could be reversible and is thus not completely equivalent to species extinction. Ecosystem collapse can lead to catastrophic declines of carrying capacity and mass extinction (known as ecological collapse), and can also pose existential risk to human populations. Despite the strong empirical evidence, anticipating collapse is a complex problem. The collapse can happen when the ecosystem's distribution decreases below a minimal sustainable size, or when key biotic processes and features disappear due to environmental degradation or disruption of biotic interactions. These different pathways to collapse can be used as criteria for estimating the risk of ecosystem collapse. Although states of ecosystem collapse are often defined quantitatively, few studies adequately describe transitions from pristine or original state towards collapse.  Examples of collapsed ecosystems  Log‚Äìlog linear relationship between the spatial area and the temporal duration of 42 observed Earth system regime shifts The Rapa Nui subtropical broadleaf forests in Easter Island, formerly dominated by an endemic Palm, are considered collapsed due to the combined effects of overexplotaition, climate change and introduced exotic rats. The Aral Sea was an endorheic lake between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It was once considered one of the largest lakes in the world but has been shrinking since the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted for large scale irrigation. By 1997, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into much smaller hypersaline lakes, while dried areas have transformed into desert steppes. The regime shift in the northern Benguela upwelling ecosystem is considered an example of ecosystem collapse in open marine environments. Prior to the 1970s sardines were the dominant vertebrate consumers, but overfishing and two adverse climatic events (Benguela Ni√±o in 1974 and 1984) lead to an impoverished ecosystem state with high biomass of jellyfish and pelagic goby.  Risk of collapse  Possible tipping points in the climate system The concept of ecosystem collapse is used in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems to establish categories of risk for ecosystems. The category Collapsed is used as the end-point of risk assessment. Other categories of threat (Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered) are defined in terms of the probability or risk of collapse.

Life and activism Born to Mr and Mrs Michael Shanahan in 1897, Jane was better known as Jennie or Jinny. Her family had lived in a one-room tenement in Mercer Street. She came from a large family but five of her brothers and sisters died young. She got a job working at the Jacob's Biscuit Factory. She was an active leader of the Irish Women Workers' Union and caught up in the Lock out. She joined the Irish Citizen Army in 1913 where women were treated as more equals than was typical for the time and as a result she took part in army manoeuvres and recruit training. When the Easter Rising occurred she had been manager of the co-operative shop in Liberty Hall. As a soldier in the ICA, she was sent to take Dublin Castle under the command of Sean Connolly. The attempt failed and they returned to City Hall which they held for the next day. On the roof of the building she saw the death of her commander to sniper fire. A story given was that she met British soldiers on the way back from Dublin Castle to City Hall and they assumed she was a captive civilian. Then they asked if she was alright and for what information she could give them about the rebels. She replied that while they had treated her well enough, there were hundreds of them up on the roof. The British soldiers advanced more slowly, despite having made headway already and this gave the garrison time to get into place. Shanahan was one of the women arrested after 1916 and detailed in Richmond Barracks. She was released on 8 May 1916 after which she continued to support the Irish Volunteers. In 12 May 1917 she and Rosie Hackett, Helena Molony, Brigid Davis locked themselves into the remains of Liberty Hall and hung a banner from the walls declaring ‚ÄúJames Connolly murdered 12th May 1916‚Äù. They worked endlessly to ensure the story of 1916 did not merely drift into song. During the War of Independence Shanahan had to work to avoid further arrests by the authorities for hiding guns and dispatches. She ran a hospital in Cullenswood House where St Enda's was originally homed. After Shanahan's death in 1936, Helena Molony delivered the oration at her grave. She was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

Electricity  Electrical power is the widely utilized energy source in Azerbaijan in terms of domestic and industrial use. Electricity production and its distribution are covered by the state-owned Azerenerji JSC and Azerishig JSC. The first electricity production plants in Azerbaijan were established at Bayil avenue (\\"Bakinski dok\\") in 1895 and in Bibiheybat-Bayil cape which was put into use in 1901, as well as the Belqorod power station in Beliy Qorod in 1902. Private power companies and stations were nationalized after Azerbaijan was invaded by the 11th Army of Soviet Russia in 1920. Baku power network operated under ‚ÄúElektrotok‚Äù department of Azneft until it was transferred to newly established \\"Azenerji\\" Azerbaijan Region Energy Office in 1935. Throughout the years, a number of changes were applied to the companies dealing with electrical power production and distribution. In 1993 ‚ÄúAzerenerji Production Association‚Äù was formed as a public company responsible for electrical power production and transmission in the country which was transformed into ‚ÄúAzerenerji JSC‚Äù in 1996.

Rabia also commits suicide because of Rohais betrayal as she was now unable to face her family, leaving Bia deeply grieved and blaming Rohail and Shafay for her sisters death. Shafay's mother decides on making her son's last days by keeping him happy and tracks down Bia and asking for her hand by her brother, however at first she denied Shafay's idea of marrying her due to her lower class. However Shafay's uncle is angry on the mothers decision but still both keep the Aids a secret. After Bia expects her first child, we come to know that she is HIV positive too. She comes to know this but is threatened to keep her mouth shut. Her behavior towards Shafay gets colder, but Shafay has no idea why is it so.

Bia spends her days at their house becoming their daughter, as non of them knew that she was their sons friends wife. On the other hand, Shafay's uncle screams out that Bia had Aids because of Shafay, and depressed Shafay gets on with finding Bia.

Guyger said that she had entered the apartment believing it was her own and that she shot Jean believing he was a burglar. Guyger was not arrested for several days, and then was initially charged with manslaughter, creating mistrust in the process and outrage over the killing of an unarmed African American citizen. It resulted in protests and accusations of racial bias and she was later charged with murder. On October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder. The next day, she received a sentence of ten years in prison.  Shooting  Guyger's apartment was on the third floor, directly below Jean's apartment on the fourth, in an apartment building with mostly identical floor plans on each level. Guyger testified that she thought the apartment was her own, and that she found the door slightly ajar, and she testified that she thought Jean was an intruder in the darkened living room where he was sitting eating ice cream, in an apartment she thought was hers. She claimed she feared Jean would kill her. Jean was unarmed. After Guyger shot Jean, she called 9-1-1. Jean was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died from his wound. The Texas Rangers investigated the shooting, which led to Guyger's arrest three days later. Guyger was initially charged with manslaughter, but was later charged with murder. The initial charge of manslaughter and the racial aspect of the shooting resulted in protests in the following days. The Dallas Police Department placed Guyger on administrative leave after the shooting. The department fired her on September 24, 2018.  Victim  Botham Shem Jean, a 26-year-old black man, was a Harding University alumnus and an accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Jean was born in Saint Lucia. Following the shooting, an attorney representing Jean's family accused the Dallas police department of attempting to smear Jean's reputation by publicizing a police affidavit showing that police seized 10.4 grams of marijuana from Jean's apartment. The lawyers also disputed the account of the incident that Guyger told officials, which was recorded in the arrest warrant affidavit, and asserted that two independent witnesses had come forward to give recollections that conflicted with Guyger's account. An attorney for Jean asserted that witnesses claimed they heard knocking on the door to Jean's apartment and that a witness claimed they heard a woman's voice saying \\"Let me in, let me in.\\"  Perpetrator  Amber Ren√©e Guyger (born August 9, 1988) was 30 years old at the time of the shooting. She had been on the Dallas police force for almost five years.  Trial  On November 30, 2018, Guyger was indicted on murder charges by a Dallas County grand jury. On September 22, 2019, the day before the trial began, Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot took part in an interview regarding the trial in spite of a gag order issued by Judge Tammy Kemp in January of that year. After questioning jurors, who reported that they had not seen the interview or other media coverage of the trial, Kemp denied the defense's motion for a mistrial, and sequestered the jury. Manslaughter charges would have required proof of recklessness, while murder charges require proof that the defendant killed with intent. The prosecutors alleged criminal intent for two reasons: firstly, they said her arrival at the wrong apartment (on the wrong floor) was not caused by tiredness, but rather caused by the conversation she had immediately prior with her lover trying to arrange a meeting that night, and secondly that she did not follow standard police protocol of not entering a building with a potential burglar inside and instead calling for backup from the police station, which was two blocks away. On October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder. The jury deliberated for six hours to reach the verdict of murder. The jurors also considered the lesser charge of manslaughter. She was the first Dallas police officer to be convicted of murder since the 1973 murder of Santos Rodriguez. On October 2, 2019, Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison after the jury deliberated for an hour. During the sentencing hearing, Jean's mother Allison provided emotional testimony and some of Guyger's text messages and social media posts that were \\"racist and offensive\\" were shared. Jean's younger brother Brandt forgave and hugged Guyger during her sentencing. Jean's father Bertrum also stated that he forgave Guyger but had wanted a stiffer sentence. Trial judge Tammy Kemp, who is also African- American, drew controversy when she embraced Guyger and handed her a Bible, with the Freedom from Religion Foundation criticizing her for alleged proselytizing. On October 16, 2019, Guyger's attorneys filed a notice of appeal requesting a new trial. Guyger is currently imprisoned in the Mountain View Correctional Center.https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=13546830 On August 7th, 2020 Guyger's attorneys filed an appeal of the conviction on the grounds \\"there was insufficient evidence to convict her of murder. The court should either acquit Guyger of that charge, or acquit her of murder, convict her of criminally negligent homicide, and hold a new hearing on the punishment\\".  Aftermath  On January 31, 2019, ABC News reported that one witness, identified as \\"Bunny\\", provided video evidence of the aftermath of the shooting to the Dallas County District Attorney's Office, in addition to publishing it online. She said that as a result of the video, she received harassment and death threats. She also said that the pharmaceutical company she worked at terminated her after various phone calls to the company calling her a \\"radical\\", \\"anti-police\\" and \\"a black extremist\\", and that the company revoked her credentials. On October 4, 2019, at 10:40 pm, prosecution witness and Jean's across-the-hall neighbor, Joshua Brown, was shot and killed in an apartment complex parking lot. He was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Despite social media rumors that Brown was killed at the same apartment where Guyger shot Jean, he was killed at an apartment complex he had moved to, about five miles from where Jean and Guyger had lived. Witnesses could not identify the physical features of the shooter or shooters, but said they saw them speed out of the parking lot in a silver four-door sedan after firing multiple gunshots at Brown. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins also stated that while Brown was shot more than once, it was not in either the mouth or head as rumored on social media. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson encouraged people to come forward with information that could provide help with the ongoing investigation. On October 8, Dallas Police announced that they had identified three suspects in Brown's killing and had arrested one of them, and that the suspects had been involved in a drug deal with Brown that turned deadly. They said that after searching Brown's apartment, they had confiscated 12 pounds of marijuana, 143 grams of THC cartridges and $4,000 in cash. Brown's attorney said he was glad that the Dallas Police had apprehended suspects but called for an independent investigation by another agency. Clint Smith of the think tank New America and radio host Zerlina Maxwell expressed doubt that three men would travel 300 miles to purchase drugs from Brown. A second suspect was arrested the next day, and on December 8, all three men were indicted on charges of capital murder, although one of them remained at large.

He raced only as a juvenile in 2014 when he won his first three races including the Coventry Stakes and the Prix Morny. He ran poorly on his only subsequent start and was retired to stud duty. He had fertility problems and sired relatively few foals before dying at the age of six. Background The Wow Signal was a bay horse with a small white star and three white socks bred in Ireland by Tommy Stack. At the Tattersalls Ireland sale in September 2013 the yearling was put up for auction and sold for ‚Ç¨13,000 to the Lynn Lodge Stud. In April 2014 the two-year-old colt was entered in the Ascot Select Sale, a \\"breeze-up\\" event in which the entrants are required to be ridden in a public gallop before entering the auction ring. He was bought for ¬£50,000 by Sean Quinn on behalf of his father John Quinn. The colt entered the ownership of Ross Harmon and was taken into training with John Quinn at the Bellwood Cottage Stables at Settrington, North Yorkshire. He was sired by Starpangledbanner who was a champion sprinter in Australia before relocating to Europe where he won the Golden Jubilee Stakes and July Cup in 2010 and won the Cartier Champion Sprinter award. As a breeding stallion he had serious fertility problems, but sired a few other good horses including Home of the Brave (John of Gaunt Stakes) and Anthem Alexander (Queen Mary Stakes). The Wow Signal's dam Muravka never raced but did better as a broodmare, also producing the Listed winner Miss Infinity. Her dam Tabdea was a half-sister to Ta Rib and a descendant of the American broodmare Dust Whirl (foaled 1928), making her a distant relative of Whirlaway and Conquistador Cielo. The colt was apparently named after the Wow! signal a strong narrowband radio signal which has been suggested to be of extraterrestrial origin. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, The Wow Signal contested a maiden race over six furlongs at Ayr Racecourse on 21 May in which he was ridden by Phillip Makin and won by nine lengths. Following his success the colt was acquired privately by the Joaan Al Thani's Al Shaqab Racing organisation. John Quinn explained that while he had received many offers, the Al Shaqab's bid was the only one which promised that he could continue training the horse. Frankie Dettori took the ride when the colt was moved up sharply in class for the Group 2 Coventry Stakes over the same distance at Royal Ascot on 17 June. He was made the 5/1 joint-favourite alongside Adaay, while the other thirteen runners were headed by War Envoy, Kool Kompany and Cappella Sansevero (Marble Hill Stakes). After racing in second place, The Wow Signal took the lead a furlong out and won by one and three quarter lengths from Cappella Sansevero. After the race Dettori said \\"I was worried about the ground being a bit quick but he showed tremendous courage, he's a real good two-year-old\\". After a two-month break, The Wow Signal was sent to France and stepped up to Group 1 class and sent to France for the Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 24 August. He had been originally aimed at the Phoenix Stakes earlier that month but was withdrawn after he was found to be suffering from a minor respiratory infection. He started joint-favourite with Ervedya in a nine-runner field for the Morny which also included the American-trained colt Hootenanny (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Goken (Prix du Bois). After being positioned in mid- division by Dettori, he moved up to join Hootenanny in the last 200 metres and got the better of the American challenger in the final strides to win by half a length. Following the colt's victory, John Quinn said \\"It's a great day... these are the days you dream of. Everyone works hard and you hope you might come across a horse like him\\". Al Shaqab's racing manager Harry Herbert commented \\"It was a really superb performance over a trip that is probably getting too short for him...It became a real slog but he's such a tough horse, he battled it out and it's a terrific training performance\\". For his final run of the season The Wow Signal was sent to France again and started 7/4 favourite for the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He led for most of the way but weakened abruptly in the last 400 metres and came home last of the nine runners behind the subsequently disqualified Gleneagles. Quinn commented \\"I suppose it's been a long year for him, unlike some he's been to all the big gigs, and he's off on a long holiday now, but his form is rock solid and he'll be back.\\" In the official European two-year-old classification for 2014 The Wow Signal was given a rating of 116 (level with Gleneagles and Richard Pankhurst), making him the fifth-best colt of the year behind Belardo, Charming Thought, Elm Park and Ivawood. He tied with Gleneagles as the best two-year-old colt to race in France. =2015: three-year-old season= The Wow Signal was being prepared for a run in the 2000 Guineas when he sustained an injury in May and was retired from racing. John Quinn described him as \\"a very tough horse with a great constitution and tremendous acceleration who ran well on all types of ground\\". Stud record The Wow Signal began his career as a breeding stallion in Australia in late 2015 before returning to stand at Al Shaqab's Haras de Bouquetot at Clarbec in Normandy. Like his sire he was sub-fertile and sired relatively few foals in either location. He died in March 2018 after suffering from laminitis.

A road roller vehicle was gifted to the park in 1959 after it was no longer required by the West Riding County Council. It was used by children to play on until it was removed in 1990 due to fears of asbestos flaking off the vehicle. A campaign is underway to restore the road roller to working condition.

She rallied support from members of parliament which led to changes in the law in 1906 which allowed women law graduates the same privileges as men. In 1909, she was able to practise as a high court barrister. Nanna Berg who had received a legal diploma in 1887, was not authorized to work in the country's high courts but was restricted to the lower courts. Biography Born in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg on 18 December 1878, Henny Sophie Petersen was the daughter of the farmer Jens Petersen (died 1924) and his wife Boline Buch (1839‚Äì1914). On 19 August 1913, she married the high court barrister Ove Knud Magnussen (1881‚Äì1973). After matriculating from Gammelholm Latin- og Realskole, she studied law at the University of Copenhagen when permission was given to women to undertake the course. After she rallied the support of members of parliament, the minister of justice Peter Adler Alberti proposed changes in the regulations allowing women to serve as lawyers with the same privileges as men. As a result, Magnussen was able to join a legal firm in 1906. She encouraged members of parliament to support her attempt to be allowed to work in the high courts. Thanks to the support she received, she was able to practise in all the courts of Denmark from 1909, becoming the first woman to do so. She made a study trip to Oxford and London from September 1913 to March 1914. For a number of years she worked with the high court attorneys Charles Shaw and Harald Dietrichson, finally setting up a practice of her own. She was able to attract many female clients, especially in connection with marital disputes and divorce cases. She headed the Copenhagen branch of the Danish Women's Society from 1907 to 1909. Henny Magnussen died on 20 June 1937 in Copenhagen, after suffering from heart problems.

He held office during the War of the Spanish Succession, when the French colony on Saint Kitts was lost to the English and the other islands were under constant threat. Family Charles de Machault, chevalier, seigneur de Belmont, was the son of Fran√ßois de Machault (1601‚Äì78), seigneur de La Motte-Romaincourt, Almoner of the Duke of Orl√©ans, Treasurer of France in Picardy. His mother was Genevi√®ve Sauzion, daughter of Jean de Sauzion, the king's secretary. His older brother was Claude de Machault (died 1678), seigneur de Garges et Romaincourt. Naval career First Battle of Tobago Machaut became a ship-of- the-line captain in the French royal navy and a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He was appointed lieutenant de vaisseau in 1667. In 1671 he was promoted to capitaine de fr√©gate and in 1673 to capitaine de vaisseau. From 1676 to 1677 he was in command of Le Laurier (40). On 3 March 1677 he fought under Admiral Jean II d'Estr√©es in the First Battle of Tobago. In 1683 he was in command of Le Fendant (54). In 1689 he was in command of Le Vermandois (60). On 1 April 1689 he fought in the Battle of Bantry Bay. In 1690 he was in command of Le Parfait (64). He fought in the Battle of Beachy Head on 30 June 1690. As a capitaine de vaisseau Machault visited Martinique in January 1702 en route from Lisbon to join the Spanish fleet in Havana in the squadron of vice-admiral the comte de Chateau-Reynaut. Governor general of the Antilles =Appointment= Charles Desnotz, governor general of the French Antilles, died on 6 October 1701, and Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut became interim governor general. Marc Hyacinthe de Rosmadec was named on 4 January 1702 to succeed Denotz, but died in Havana before taking office. Machault was appointed governor as of 1 July 1702. He was informed of his appointment by a letter of 28 June 1702. On 7 September Guitaud also died, and was replaced as interim governor by Nicolas de Gabaret, who held office until Machault reached Martinique. A letter of 27 November 1702 emphasised the urgency of Machault's departure. Machault finally presented his credentials to the sovereign council in Martinique on 24 March 1703. He brought a promotion for Gabaret to second in command to the governor general (king's lieutenant to the general government of the islands). =Defense of Guadeloupe= Machault took office during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1713), in which France was opposed by Germany, Britain and the Dutch Republic. On 1 November 1702 he was informed of the loss of Saint-Christophe to the English, with the garrison of three companies withdrawn from this island to Martinique. On 20 December 1702 he was informed of the threat to Guadeloupe from the English governor Christopher Codrington. When he reached Martinique in late March 1703 Machault found that the intendant Fran√ßois-Roger Robert was gathering reinforcements for Guadeloupe, which the English had invaded. 1,500 men volunteered, of whom 700 were chosen for the expedition. Gabaret, who was senior to governor Charles Auger of Guadeloupe, was given overall command. Nine barques, two ships and a brigantine (Trompeuse, Union, and Samaritaine) were used for transport, and left in the morning of 31 March 1703 escorted by two warships and a frigate that Machault had brought to the West Indies. To prepare for any event, Machault remained in Martinique with at least 1,400 good soldiers. Gabaret arrived in Guadeloupe on 3 April 1703. He pursued scorched earth tactics that proved effective in combination with the effect on the English of climate and drink. The English withdrew on 15 May 1703. In order to attack Guadeloupe with the maximum forces, the English had denuded their other colonies of armed men. Machault was told that Saint Christophe was completely defenseless and could easily be retaken. Machault had three warships at Fort Royal, six or seven well-armed merchant vessels and several corsair ships, but chose not to take advantage of the opportunity. After the return of the force from Guadeloupe on 21 May 1703, Machault proposed to reorganized the West Indies militia so he could reward their service in Guadeloupe by promotions. He would convert the four battalions that Blenac has created in 1693 into four regiments commanded by colonels and lieutenant colonels, and would also create a cavalry regiment. The minister Count J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux de Pontchartrain agreed with the proposal, obtained approval from the king, and asked Machault to provide a list of the newly promoted or created officers with details of their service. =Corsairs and trade= During the wartime conditions of Machault's term of office both privateering and illegal trade with the enemy seem to have been common given the shortage of adequate supplies from France. In 1703 almost twenty vessels based in Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue were engaged in attacks on enemy shipping. In 1704 thirty privateers took 163 prizes. Prizes and captured goods were sold in the French islands and in Spanish American ports. On 4 July 1703 Machault issued a decree that attempted to settle disputes between corsairs when several were involved in taking a prize. A general rule was that a corsair could only claim a prize if it had been with the range of a cannon. An exception was made when a prize being hunted by one corsair was taken by another to the leeward. Many of the French administrators including local governors were accused of accepting bribes to turn a blind eye to the slave trade, or of trading in slaves on their own account. In 1703 Machault denied accusations, saying \\"In times of war and peace, it has remained my concern to stop the abuses.\\" Due in part to illicit trade the slave population on Martinique grew by 28.8% from 1702 to 1709. At one point Machault and intendant Nicolas Fran√ßois Arnoul de Vaucresson were given special permission to trade sugar from Martinique for salt beef and other provisions at Saint Thomas, Barbados. =Trial of de Gennes= After the comte Jean-Baptiste de Gennes surrendered Saint Christophe to the English in 1702 he embarked for Cayenne with all the goods and slaves he had been able to salvage. He was captured by a Dutch corsair and taken to Saint Thomas, Barbados. From there he was returned to Martinique. Machault seems to have been instructed by the court as governor general to prosecute the Comte de Gennes, but in such a way as not to besmirch his honour unless he was found guilty of excessive cowardice. When he reached Martinique the count was arrested and taken to Fort Saint Pierre, Major Coullet was told to start investigating his case and that of his lieutenants. Everyone interviewed recalled that Saint Christophe had been considered indefensible, and that de Guitaut and the intendant had planned to send boats to transport its inhabitants to other islands. However, it seemed that the prosecution had been directed to find a culprit. After a short inquiry Gennes was tried in August 1704, found guilty of cowardice and condemned to be degraded from the nobility and stripped of all his title and positions. Gennes appealed the decision. A few days later the king's ship Th√©tis arrived at Fort Royal to transport the comte de Germes to France. He was captured by the English and taken to Plymouth, where he died before he could defend himself in France. However, the king treated the case as if he had not been found guilty, and his titles were retained and a pension paid to his widow. =Raids on Saint Kitts and Nevis= On 2 September 1705 Machault was asked to provide support to the mission against Nevis and Saint Christopher that had just been entrusted to Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. The 1706 attacks on Saint Kitts and Nevis were organized from France. One of Iberville's two squadrons left Brest on 15 December 1705 under Count Louis- Henri de Chavagnac and reached Martinique by the end of January 1706. The second, under Iberville, would leave from La Rochelle later. Machault was unprepared for Chavagnac. When he had heard of the proposed expedition he had written to Louis XIV asking for Martinique to be allowed to concentrate on agriculture rather than war preparations, since otherwise the impoverished inhabitants would be exposed to starvation. He had assumed that his request had been welcomed by the court, and had made no preparations. Chavagnac was not surprised but immediately complained, and asked to speak to the commanders Collart and du Buq. It emerged that since the king could not afford all the costs of the campaign, Martinique and Guadeloupe were expected to provide armaments, transport and men, and to receive compensation in the form of spoils. In less than eight days Collart and du Buq had organized 400 volunteers, while three hundred buccaneers would accompany them once food had been collected, which was difficult in Martinique at that time. The squadron left for its rendezvous in Guadeloupe on 4 February 1760. The first landing was made on Saint Christophe in the early hours of 22 February. After some fighting, having caused considerable destruction, collected some slaves and other booty and now short of food, the force left on 28 February 1706 and returned to Martinique in March. Iberville reached Martinique a few days after Chavagnac had returned, and went on to raid Nevis. He overran the whole island, blew up its fort, and returned to Martinique with 22 captured merchant ships. 3,200 slaves and other booty. Many of the slaves were disposed of for the profit of Iberville and his associates rather than that of the investors in the expedition. Iberville sailed to Saint-Domingue, where he sold 1,900 slaves. He went on to Havana, where he died of yellow fever on 9 July 1706. Machault died in Martinique of yellow fever in 1709. He was succeeded by Gabaret on 7 January 1709. In 1710 Gabaret was in turn succeeded by Raymond Balthazar Ph√©lipeaux.

He headed the Laboratory of Biogeography at the USSR AS Institute of Geography from 1962 to 1983. Biography Yuri Isakov was born on 7 February 1912 in Moscow to the family of a mathematics teacher. In his high school days, he became interested in biology and joined the Moscow Zoo's in 1927, studying under Professor . Upon graduating from school in 1928, his effort to enrol at the 1st Moscow University went in vain as his father came from an aristocratic background. He later worked as a guide at the zoo and in 1933 he was successful in becoming a student of biology, studying the reproduction of the red squirrel. He was influenced by the biologist Aleksandr Formozov. In 1934 he was imprisoned and sent into exile in Karelia. The cause was apparently a politically critical poem written by a member of the Young Biologists' Club. The NKVD interrogated members and 13 persons were sent to a labour camp, accused of counter-revolutionary activities. He too was considered guilty for not recognising the political crimes of others and for not denouncing them. In prison, he was involved in hunting squirrels for their pelt. He was released in 1937 but forbidden to take up permanent residence anywhere within 100 kilometres of Moscow. He then travelled through the steppe to Gasan-Kuli on the Caspian coast and found work in the eponymous nature reserve in Turkmenistan. Here he studied water birds. In 1940 he married zoologist Olga Nikolayevna Sassonova. In 1941 the draft board referred him to a medical station in Siberia's Tomsk to fight tularemia. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill during this period but recovered. He also continued studies through correspondence courses at Moscow State University and completed his examination in 1944. After World War II he became director of the Volga Delta Nature Reserve in Astrakhan and in 1947 he studied the effects of damming of the Volga and Sheksna with the creation of the Rybinsk Reservoir. He authored parts of the Birds of the Soviet Union dealing with the Anseriformes. In 1953, after Stalin's death, he was permitted to return to Moscow and in 1961 he was rehabilitated and was able to obtain a doctorate in 1963. From 1958 he worked on biogeography under Formozov. In 1967 he was appointed professor. Along with Boris N. Bogdanov, he worked on conservation initiatives. He was a corresponding member of the British Ornithologists' Union from 1976.

His father was of Greek-Italian descent, while his mother was from Austria. His father died in 1947, while Cari was still a young boy, which led his mother to take him to Austria where he spent the years growing up to adulthood.

It is the founding school of the English Schools Foundation, and is still a member. The school has been accredited by international organisations such as the Council of International Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The school was originally located in the Hong Kong Mid- Levels district (the site of a former British military hospital) until the school moved to two campuses in Sha Tin District (known as Campus A (ISSTW): Pok Hong Estate, Sha Tin Wai) and Tai Wai (Campus B (ISTW): Sun Chui Estate, Tai Wai) in December 2017, due to renovations to the former campus. It currently houses around 1,200 students across 33 nationalities. Island School is a registered IB World School and offers the IB diploma program along with an alternative BTEC program in the senior years. History  Island School is home to children from a large number of countries. Stephen Loggie is the current principal of Island School. The previous principal was Christopher Binge, who had been secondary principal at the La Ch√¢taigneraie campus of the International School of Geneva. Binge studied mathematics at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, was head until June 2009. Binge left to become the head of Markham College. Campus The previous campus of Island School in 2016 The former campus consisted of seven blocks ranging from five to seven floors high, with blocks 1 to 6 arranged in a rectangular fashion. Students could travel to adjacent blocks by linked walkways or footbridges. As the campus was situated on mountainous terrain, blocks located close to the mountain were placed at a higher altitude than their counterparts, and as such the floors between different blocks were often not correlated. The former campus was then demolished and all learning was diverted to the two replacement campuses. The two replacement campuses, Sha Tin Wai and Tai Wai, house two different sets of levels. Sha Tin Wai houses grades 7, 8, 12 and 13, while Tai Wai houses grades 9, 10 and 11.

This term came into being in the context of the escalating conflicts on issues of sovereignty between Vietnam and China over the South China Sea in the 21st century. The term uses the name of a historic victory with the ironic implication that in an actual naval battle, the Vietnamese navy will defeat Chinese navy. Background During the First Indochina War, a Vietnamese struggle for independence f the Battle of Dien Bien Phu took place in 1954. This victory was of great importance and deep meaning, marking the greatest victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during the First Indochina War. The Vietnamese victorious, the French were defeated and signed the Geneva Agreement, leaving Vietnam. In December of 1972, the United States Air Force bombed North Vietnam. This was the largest bombardment of U.S. air forces in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The bombing ended on December 30, when the United States agreed to sign the Paris Agreement to leave the war. This event was broadcast in Vietnam using the iconic \\"battle of Dien Bien Phu on sky\\" to emphasize its ultimate and grandiose significance. Over two years later, Vietnam reunited. Usage Currently, a formal war between Vietnam and China has not yet taken place in the South China Sea, the battle can be considered a strategic decision so it has not happened yet.

For more than four months in France to mobilize peace and when forced to hold guns, we remember the opening sentence of the Call for National Resistance (20-12-1946): \\"We want peace, we was has been conciliatory, but ... We certainly do not expect any more Dien Bien Phu in battle on sea or on land. Like our ancestors, we are always looking forward to harmonizing with the whole world, especially with China, \\"bordering mountains, bordering rivers, bordering seas\\" but if we are forced to do so, we will do what our's father did.\\" The term is also used by author Nguy·ªÖn V≈© M·ªôc Thi√™ng, director of a travel business company in Ho Chi Minh City, the article was published in the May 27, 2014 edition of Thanh Ni√™n News. \\"On the surface, the Vietnamese lack of cooperation, or self-interest, seem to endure, but when the country be invade, they are differents.

Early life Ravdonikas was born in the family of marxist archeologist Vladislav Josifovitch Ravdonikas and avant-garde artist Liudmila Ivanova (1904‚Äì1977, student of Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin and Pavel Filonov) which defined his early and profound interest in arts and art history. As a teenager Ravdonikas traveled to Staraya Ladoga where his father was the director of archaeological excavations. There he made an important friendship with artist Oleg Pochtenny (1927‚Äì1997) who introduced him to etching. Despite their early age, young artists' experiments in graphic design brought them into disfavour with NKVD. Passion for fine arts and ancient artifacts was combined in Ravdonikas with the love for music and musical instruments. While in college, he tried making them himself, and at his graduation at Mukhina Higher School of Art and Design in Leningrad he already presented an organ which he built with his own hands. Craftsman and theorist In 1970s Ravdonikas emerged as one of the few Soviet specialists in early musical instruments. His works became acclaimed outside the USSR. In 1978 he was elected a fellow of the Fellowship of Makers and Researchers of Historic Instruments. Ravdonikas was occasionally invited to the State Hermitage and other museums of Leningrad with restoration assignments. His reproduction of an original Hotteterre baroque flute for the Museum of the State Institute of Music, Leningrad, was displayed at an exhibition in the US in 1980. Ravdonikas donated a set of wax toneholes and embouchures of flutes to the Museum of Musical Instruments in Leningrad. Some of his instruments belong to the Library of Congress. Throughout 1970s Ravdonikas continued his father's studies of the Onega Lake rock carvings. Ravdonikas was the first scholar who interpreted Onega objects, symbolic figures that probably date back to 5000 BCE, in the context of their astronomical orientation. His finding was that the figures fix a complete Lunar 18.6-year's cycle and that their complex was a lunar calendar. In 1980 Ravdonikas restored a Peter Kinzing's music automaton from the State Hermitage collection. Writing his report of the restoration works led Feliks to the idea of putting together a theoretic inquiry in what he later named 'spatial musical symbolism'. –ú—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç –∏–∑ –±—é—Ä–æ –†√´–Ω—Ç–≥–µ–Ω–∞ –≤ –≠—Ä–º–∏—Ç–∞–∂–µ. –ò–∑ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ ¬´–ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª—ã –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∏¬ª, 1997 . Since about that time he concentrated predominantly on musicology. Years of obscurity By the beginning of 1980s Ravdonikas was known in the Leningrad counter-culture as a polymath whose interests stretch far beyonds arts –†–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç—å –¥—É—à–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –∏—Å—á–∏—Å–ª—è–µ—Ç. –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—É ¬´–°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–π –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç¬ª, ‚Ññ 14-15, 17.06.2005, —Å. 50-56 . Many local intellectuals as well as painters, poets, and musicians (such as Andrey Reshetin, one of his students) gravitated towards the informal philosophical society in his kitchen where they exchanged ideas on various disciplines, from anthropology to mathematics and genetics and played music. Ravdonikas generously shared his vast knowledge and directly influenced many scholars. One of the tangible consequences of these meeting was the so-called Saint Petersburg authenticity movement that aimed at reviving Russian baroque music by performing it on authentic instruments and in historical settings. During the last 20 years of his life Ravdonikas rarely left Saint Petersburg. Hidden from the public eye and gradually becoming a living legend for the selected few, he studied mathematics and pythagorean theory of music and was teaching his friends. According to one of his last interviews, Ravdonikas lived in austerity. Ravdonikas died in August 2011 in poverty and was buried in Komarovo near his highly acclaimed father. Two of his children reside in Germany. Ravdonikas never traveled abroad. Legacy Only a small part of Ravdonikas' legacy is published, mostly by his student Andrey Reshetin. Much of Ravdonikas' writings, especially in genetics and ethnography, was lost. Before 1991 he was able to publish only two short pieces, although they were edited, as he complained in one of his interviews, 'beyond any recognition'.  In popular culture  Ravdonikas played a role in a 1981 Soviet film for children, 'Chto by ty vybral?' (What would you choose?). He wrote music for Lev Dodin's 1987 play, A Gentle Creature, which was a theatre adoptation of the Fyodor Dostoyevsky's story by the same title. Musicologist Liudmila Kovnatskaya called Ravdonikas \\"a rare type of Renaissance man living in our times\\".

Mary Ann Tocker (1778‚Äì1853) was the first woman in Cornwall to be tried for Libel and was celebrated as the first woman to act as her own advocate in a British court of law. She has been referred to as the first woman lawyer.H.J. Marks,The King v. Mary Ann Tocker. HeinOnline - 44 Women law.J.21 1958. She was seen as a heroine by the radical writers of her day. Her case was widely discussed in the months following her trial in August 1818. She is still referred to today in books on early women radicals as having inspired others with her stand against corruption. Early life Mary Ann Tocker was born in Tregony in 1778. She was daughter of Thomas Wheare Tocker and Dorothy Hearle. Born the second of six children, she became the eldest after the death of her older sister in 1799. Her father, Thomas Wheare Tocker, was an attorney in law from Gwinear. He died in debt in 1796 after months of illness. At the time of the trial, Mary Ann, her widowed mother and younger siblings were living in Plymouth. One brother, Henry, was studying law and hoping to become a solicitor. Background to the trial In 1813, the Rev. Gurney of Tregony obtained for his younger son, Richard Gurney, the lucrative post of Vice- warden of the Stannaries. He arranged that Richard should lodge in the Tockers' house in Plymouth and employ Henry Tocker as his secretary. Richard Gurney gambled and ran up debts. In 1817, his tailor took out a suit of outlawry against him and Gurney fled to the Continent. The Tockers had not received any rent from Gurney nor had Henry had received the salary promised for his secretarial work. The Tockers wrote to Richard's father, the Rev. Gurney, but he refused to interfere in his son's affairs. Mary Ann wrote to Richard's brother, the Vicar of Paul, and his answer revealed that his family had all but disowned Richard. On 6 June 1817, an anonymous letter appeared in The West Briton signed, ‚Äò An enemy to corruption.‚Äô The writers of the letter were Mary Ann and Henry Tocker. They exposed Richard's corrupt behaviour as Vice-warden of the Stannaries. When Richard Gurney put pressure on the editor of the West Briton to reveal the name of the writer, Mary Ann confessed that she was the writer of the letter. As Richard had the power to prevent Henry from ever succeeding as a solicitor in Plymouth, he had a hold over his former secretary. He forced Henry to write a letter begging his forgiveness for the injury done to him in the anonymous letter. However, Mary Ann could not be silenced and Richard took out the indictment for libel that brought her to court in Bodmin as if she were the sole writer of the letter. Trial On 4 August 1818, Mary Ann entered the crowded courtroom accompanied by her brother, Henry Tocker, and one sister. When the Judge expressed the opinion that the case would not be defended, Henry rose to inform him that it would be defended by the Defendant herself. The exact charge against the Defendant, as read out in court, was that of, ‚ÄòCommitting a most serious offence, in slandering the character of a gentleman in high judicial situation, by imputing to him practices of the greatest criminality, in a letter published in a newspaper called the West Briton.‚Äô Tocker The letter was then read out by the barrister for the prosecution. In it Richard Gurney was accused of gaining his position through the borough mongering system and of neglecting his duties as a Judge while himself outlawed for debt. He was also accused of demanding money from suitors before settling cases in the Stannary court. The prosecution called the editor of the West Briton to confirm that Mary Ann Tocker was the author of the letter but called no further witnesses. Mary Ann stood again to make her own defence. For two hours, she defended herself in spite of repeated interruptions from the Judge. She quoted widely from Blackstone's Commentaries, John Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding and the words of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ellenborough. The main points she made in her defence were that : * Her letter had not been published from malicious motives as she had only dwelt on the Vice-warden's misconduct in his official capacity. * Men in public office could not complain about fair comment on the execution of their duty. * Her reading of history, jurisprudence and moral philosophy led her to believe that the law was perverted when the maxim, 'the greater the truth, the greater the libel', directed the decision. * She could prove in evidence that all the charges she made in her letter were true: # It was common knowledge and reported in the papers that Richard Gurney had obtained the position of Vice-warden after his father had arranged for Lord Falmouth's candidate to be returned at the Tregony election. # Gurney's own letters, from which she quoted, proved that he was declared an outlaw for debt. # His own letters also proved that he was out of the country and unable to attend to his duties of the Stannary court from 1815 to 1819. # Gurney had demanded sums over and above the fees of the court as his own letters and a witness could confirm. The Judge told Mary Ann that she would not be allowed to prove anything nor was she allowed to call witnesses. She, then, drew her defence to a close with appeals to the jurors. She asked them to imagine how they would feel in the future if they had sent an innocent person to prison and she made a plea for common sense to prevail: \\"I trust that it will be seen this day, that it is more hazardous to commit a crime, than to publish that crime when committed.\\"Tocker Finally, Mary Ann asked that, as the prosecution was only nominally at the suit of the crown, the real prosecutor, Richard Gurney, might be called so that she could compel him to admit the facts. Yet again, she was told this would not be allowed and Mary Ann left the court. The judge then charged the Jury. He pronounced the whole letter an atrocious libel. He impressed upon them that it was not for them to decide the truth or falsehood of the assertions made as that would come before the Court of the King's Bench. He reminded them that the law allowed him to give his opinion. He told them that the publication was 'libellous in the highest degree, as it charged in the strongest way possible, a gentleman filling a high judicial position with the grossest corruption.' He finished by telling the Jury that they could not possibly lay their hand to their heart and say this publication was not libel. The jurors then asked for the papers which Mary Ann had wanted to read to them. A room was then provided for them at an inn opposite the hall. The Judge withdrew desiring them to bring the verdict to his lodgings. After about half an hour, the jury was introduced to his Lordship and the foreman pronounced a verdict of not guilty. Mary Ann later commented on the reaction of the crowds: ‚ÄúEven the Ex-Vice Warden, his father and brother, these pious and charitable pastors who came to witness my condemnation and ruin, must have heard the loud cheering of the different parties of legal gentlemen at the principal inn in Bodmin on receiving the news.‚ÄùTocker Reaction The reporter from the Treman's Exeter Flying Post was the first to publish an account of the trial on 13 August. Mary Ann then published her own account of the trial with a full transcription of her defence. She claimed that the case was singular in that it was the first case of libel ever tried in Cornwall. In her dedication and thanks to, ‚ÄúThe Honest, patriotic and intrepid jury,‚Äù she claims she was motivated by, ‚Äúthe strongest principle in human nature ‚Äì resistance to oppression.‚Äù By 17 August, The Times of London was reporting on the trial: ‚ÄúThe justice of her cause and her powerful eloquence secured her success. This lady is of a very respectable family and her own character has always been held in esteem. Her extraordinary abilities have raised her to considerable notice and her company is now anxiously courted in the first societies.‚Äù\\"Miss TOCKER.-We lately gave an account of a trial in which this lady was the defendant. She spoke.\\" Times [London, England] 17 August 1818: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 20 September 2018. Mary Ann's cause was taken up by leading radicals of the day. A summary of the trial was published by William Cobbett, then in exile in America, which went on to three editions. Richard Carlile also published an edition of Mary Ann's Trial in London. Fairburn's edition stressed the novelty of an appearance of a woman in court with the title, ‚ÄúA Female Orator! And Politician! At the Bar!!!‚Äù Thomas Jonathan Wooler, the writer of The Black Dwarf, published Mary Ann's account in his magazine acclaiming Mary Ann's success as a victory for the rights of man. From the Inner Temple, Richard Gurney published his reply to Mary Ann's pamphlet. He defended the Law of Libel as expounded by the judge and attacked Mary Ann's character. In response, Mary Ann published a second pamphlet entitled, ‚ÄúReply of Mary Ann Tocker to the false and scurrilous pamphlet of Mr. R. Gurney, ex-vice warden of the Stannaries...‚Äù In May 1819, her finances were improved for the Morning Chronicle records that a donation was received by Miss Mary Ann Tocker. The Devon County Club had raised the sum of fifty guineas in recognition of her achievement. Apart from publishing her pamphlets, little is known of Mary Ann Tocker after her trial in August 1818. However, the 1841 census shows she was still living in Breton Side, Plymouth, with her younger brother, Henry, by then a successful Plymouth solicitor. Aged 62, she was listed as a woman of 'independent means.' By 1851, she was living in Glanville Street, and was described in the census as an annuitant. She lived to the age of 75 and ended her days in Penryn, close to her relatives in Falmouth. Mary Ann lived to see how the Reform Act 1832 did away with the corrupt electoral practices of the rotten boroughs. Then twenty five years after her trial, the Libel Act 1843 changed the law on Libel to allow a defendant to argue that what had been said was true and in the public interest just as Mary Ann had argued. Legacy Mary Ann Tocker's trial was brought to the attention of the first women lawyers in America in 1958. Writing in the Women Lawyers Journal, Harry J. Marks gives his account of the trial and recommends to his readers that they should regard Mary Ann as a forerunner of their profession. More recently, Mary Ann's trial is often referred to in books on early women radicals. While Mary Ann may not have been connected to any of the radical movements of the nineteenth century, she is recognised as having inspired other women. \\"Mary Ann Tocker, who braved a libel to expose political corruption, inspired many other women with her forthright public radicalism and even led Thomas Hardy to write the anonymous letter to the Black Dwarf calling for woman's rights.\\" Like other early women radicals, Mary Ann educated herself and was motivated by her own experiences of injustice to argue for reform. \\"The prospect of the female reformer embodied in the stand of Mary Ann Tocker, prompted discussion of the form as well as the meaning of radicalism; a subject that animated a series of letters, editorials and poems, mocking and defending the 'Rights of Woman' and woman's 'ascendancy' over man.\\"Women and the people Authority, Authorship and the radical Tradition in Nineteenth-Century England.

Shen had been reported missing by her parents a day earlier when she failed to return home. The police used the GPS device in her mobile phone to locate her body in the public park. The RCMP said the attack appeared to be random. After Shen's death, RCMP told parents to talk to their kids about safety and warned the public to be vigilant. Days later, the police said that based on its investigations, the case would be considered a homicide. At its peak, nearly three hundred officers were involved in the investigation. Some \\"2,000 persons of interest\\" were investigated and were ruled out in the case. There was little progress in the case for more than a year and on the one-year anniversary of Shen's death, her family issued a letter asking the public's assistance in locating and bringing her attacker to justice.marrisashen.org: One year anniversary of the homicide of Marrisa Shen  Suspect  In a breakthrough in the case, and after a 14-month impasse from the date of the murder, on September 7, 2018, the Canadian police arrested Ibrahim Ali (born in 1990 in Syria) as a primary suspect for the murder of Marrisa Shen. Police had used a DNA dragnet technique to identify the suspect. On September 10, 2018, RCMP's integrated homicide investigation team (IHIT) gave details of his alleged involvement in a press conference saying Ali was arrested on September 7, 2018. Ali had arrived in Canada as a refugee from Syria in April 2017 just months before her murder, police say. He has been charged with first-degree murder of Shen. Now a permanent resident of Canada, police say he had no previous criminal history. He briefly appeared in court on September 14, with trial set on October 12, 2018. Ali's status as a recent Syrian refugee raised questions about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's immigration policy. Ali's court appearances were picketed by protesters calling for \\"comprehensive security screening\\" for immigrants and to \\"hold Trudeau accountable\\". The discussion surrounding the killing became a major point of contention during the February 2019 federal by-election for Burnaby South. A spokesperson for Marrisa Shen's mother communicated that while she appreciates the attention given to Marrisa's murder, she does not want the case to become political ‚Äî instead, \\"they should focus on the violence against women and children in our society, especially women of colour.\\"  References   External links  * Marrisa Shen website (Archived on September 11, 2018) * Marrisa Shen murder protest outside Vancouver court house at 222 Main Street (June 4, 2019) 2010s murders in Canada 2017 crimes in Canada 2017 in British Columbia 2017 deaths July 2017 crimes July 2017 events in Canada Child deaths Deaths by person in North America Canadian murder victims Burnaby Female murder victims ","title":"Murder of Marrisa Shen"},{"id":"58459999","text":"Frank Nikolaas Pieke (born 23 September 1957 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch cultural anthropologist and expert on modern China.
