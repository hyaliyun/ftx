The word lekor is said to be derived from a Terengganu Malay word meaning \\"to roll\\". It is usually made by grinding fish or vegetables into a paste, mixing it with sago and then deep-frying it. It comes in three main forms: lekor (long and chewy), rebus (steamed) and keping (thin and crispy). There are two types of keropok lekor which are the keropok lekor goreng and keropok lekor keping - the former are shaped like sausages with a chewy texture whereas the latter is cut into slices prior to frying, giving its crispier texture. The snack is eaten with special homemade chili blends that are particular to Terengganu and sold there; though modern innovations like adding mayonnaise and cheese sauce (the combination known locally as \\"keropok cheese\\") may also be available.

Kennedy, was launched 15 February 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Mrs. Eugene F. Essner; and commissioned 16 August 1920, Lieutenant Commander Charles Jefferson Parrish in command. Kennedy arrived in San Diego, California, her homeport, 7 October 1920 and joined the Pacific Fleet in exercises and maneuvers along the West Coast from the Pacific Northwest to South America. Gunnery drills, torpedo practice, plane-guard duty, fleet problems, and war maneuvers with the Army kept Kennedy busy at sea. During the spring of 1924, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal for fleet concentrations in the Caribbean. She returned San Diego 22 April to resume operations of her homeport. She sailed 13 June 1925 for a fleet problem and joint exercises off Hawaii. During this cruise she accompanied the Battle Fleet to Pago Pago, Samoa, and ports in Australia and New Zealand, returning San Diego 26 September. In 1927 she revisited the Caribbean for more exercises, this time calling at Norfolk, Virginia and New York before returning San Diego 22 May. Kennedy sailed once again 9 April 1928 for large scale maneuvers in Hawaiian waters, resuming operations out of San Diego 2 months later. After training cruises for reserves during the summer of 1929, Kennedy arrived in San Diego 27 September and decommissioned there 1 May 1930. Her hulk was sold 19 March 1931 and scrapped in accordance with the terms of the London Treaty limiting naval armament.

It was originally released for the Atari 8-bit family, then ported to the Atari 5200, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX. and later the Atari 7800 and the Nintendo Famicom. The game was called Ballblaster during development; pirated versions of the game went by this name as well.Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts pg. 54 The principal creator and programmer of Ballblazer was David Levine. In 1990, LucasArts and Rainbow Arts released a remake and follow-up to this game, called Masterblazer. This game was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS. On March 31, 1997, a remake of the original titled Ballblazer Champions was released for the Sony PlayStation. Gameplay Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a \\"rotofoil\\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \\"droid\\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective. A player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower. Pushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \\"sudden death\\", where the first player to score wins. Soundtrack Ballblazer's theme music, called \\"Song of the Grid\\" and heard between matches, was algorithmically generated, a technique designed by Lucasfilm Games team leader Peter Langston and called \\"riffology\\". The lead melody is assembled from a predefined set of 32 eight-note melody fragments, or riffs, which are put together randomly by an algorithm that also makes choices on several parameters including \\"how fast to play the riff, how loud to play it, when to omit or elide notes, when to insert a rhythmic break\\". The melody is accompanied by bassline, drums and chords, which are also assembled on the fly by a simplified version of the above approach. In effect the music plays forever, without repeating itself but without straying too far from the original theme. Langston, an experienced jazz, rock, and folk musician, said of Ballblazer's music: \\"One reviewer, an eminent jazz player [Pat Metheny], said it sounded like John Coltrane did it. I think that's my best compliment so far.\\" The Atari 7800 version was one of the rare releases for the system to use the POKEY additional sound chip. A sample of Ballblazer music from the Commodore 64 version : File:Ballblazer.ogg Reception Computer Gaming World stated that the \\"quick and intense\\" Ballblazer \\"squeezes more out of the Atari 400/800 than any game I've ever seen ... spectacular graphics\\". Info rated Ballblazer four stars out of five, stating that \\"It is undoubtedly the FASTEST game available for the 64\\" and recommending it to \\"gamers with strobe-like reflexes\\". Zzap!64 gave an enthusiastic review of the Commodore 64 version of the game, their only criticism being weak sound effects. With an overall rating of 98% the game was described as being \\"The best sports simulation to hit the 64 yet.\\" See also *Rescue on Fractalus!

History =Incorporated Television Programme Company= Television mogul Lew Grade set up the Incorporated Television Programme Company (ITP) with Prince Littler and Val Parnell in 1954. Originally designed to be a contractor for the UK's new ITV network, the company failed to win a contract when the Independent Television Authority felt that doing so would give too much control in the entertainment business to the Grade family's companies (which included large talent agencies and theatre interests) although the ITA said that ITP were free to make their own programmes which they could sell to the new network companies. ITP put most of the production budget into producing one show, The Adventures of Robin Hood (ITV, 1955‚Äì59). However, the winner of one of the contracts, the Associated Broadcasting Development Company, had insufficient funds to start broadcasting, so the ITP owners were brought into the consortium‚Äînow renamed the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC)‚Äîand Lew Grade came to dominate it. =Incorporated Television Company= In 1957, now known as Incorporated Television Company (ITC), the company became a subsidiary of Associated Television (ATV)‚Äîthe name ABC had adopted after threats of legal action from fellow ITV company Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd‚Äîand produced its own programmes for ATV and for syndication in the United States. It also distributed ATV material outside of the UK. From 1966 to 1982 it was a subsidiary of Associated Communications Corporation after the acquisition of ATV. The initials 'ITC' stood for two different things: Independent Television Corporation for sales to the Americas, and Incorporated Television Company for sales to the rest of the world. The American Independent Television Corporation was formed in 1958 as a joint venture with Jack Wrather. In September 1958 it purchased Television Programs of America (TPA) for $11,350,000. Wrather sold his shares to Lew Grade at the end of the decade. The large foreign sales achieved by ITC during the British government's export drives of the 1960s and 1970s led to ACC receiving the Queen's Award for Export on numerous occasions. During 1988 The Bell Group, the owners of ITC were taken over by the Bond Corporation.Holmes √† Court announces reverse takeover at Bell.Richard Battley.

In November 1988 ITC Entertainment was bought by its management.Bond's sale of ITC estimated at ¬£60m. John Bell, City Editor. The Times, Thursday, 10 November 1988 In 1990, ITC abandoned television production and concentrated on low-budget feature films. TV production at ITC would not resume until the company forged a deal with producer David Gerber in 1993. In 1989, ITC Home Video was formed in the United Kingdom, to make use of the many hours of programmes in the archive, then unseen for years. This short-lived home entertainment division would end in 1991. In the following period, ITC continued to distribute its past library. In 1995, PolyGram purchased the company for $156 million.

On 10 December 1998, Universal Studios' parent, Seagram purchased PolyGram for $10.2 billion.Seagram swallows PolyGram CNN.com 10 December 1998. Retrieved 19 July 2014 In early January 1999, Carlton Communications bought the ITC television and film library from PolyGram/Seagram for ¬£91 million, which reunited the programme library of ATV and Central Television and doubled the stock of its library division Carlton International, by giving it a total of 15,000 hours of programming. Carlton chairman Michael Green said: 'The ITC library is a jewel in the crown. We can now unite it with the other gems from Britain's film and television heritage in our excellent library.' In 2004, Carlton merged with Granada plc to form ITV plc. ITV Studios continues to release ITC's original output through television and internet streaming repeats, books and DVD and Blu-ray releases. In 2005, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the company, Network released a DVD box set entitled ITC 50 featuring episodes from eighteen different ITC productions. Productions A still from the 1973 ITC Entertainment \\"Spin Top\\" logo ident. =Reputation= ITC is best known for being the company behind many successful British cult TV filmed series during the 1960s and 1970s, such as The Saint, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), Danger Man, The Baron, Gideon's Way, The Champions, The Prisoner, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Stingray, Joe 90, Man in a Suitcase, Strange Report, Department S, The Persuaders!, Jason King, The Adventurer, The Protectors, Space 1999, and Return of the Saint. It was also the production company for The Muppet Show and Julie on Sesame Street which were both made at ATV's Elstree Studios and distributed in the UK by ATV and in the US by ITC. =Entry into production= ITC got its start as a production company when former American producer Hannah Weinstein approached Lew Grade. Weinstein wanted to make a programme called The Adventures of Robin Hood. Weinstein proposed making the series for ITV and simultaneously marketing it in the United States through an American TV distribution company, Official Films. The series was a big success in both countries, running from 1955 until 1959 on CBS and ATV London. =\\"Ground-breakages\\"= Grade realised the potential in overseas sales and colour television (the last 14 episodes of The Adventures of Sir Lancelot were filmed in colour a decade before colour television existed in the UK), and ITC combined high production values with exotic locations and uses of variations on the same successful formula for the majority of its television output. =ITC United States programmes= Although most of the ITC series were produced in Britain, ITC often worked with Television Programs of America (TPA) and several series were filmed in America. Possibly the earliest ITC series produced in the US was Fury, a Saturday morning live-action series, about a beloved ranch horse, which starred Peter Graves and ran on NBC in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1963 Gerry Anderson's Anderson-Provis (AP) Films became part of ACC and produced Fireball XL-5, the hugely successful children's series Thunderbirds and, under its successor company Century 21 Television/Cinema Productions, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. ITC also funded Anderson-created programmes aimed at the adult market, including UFO and Space: 1999. It was at ITC's request that Fanderson, \\"the Gerry Anderson Appreciation Society,\\" was founded. Another ITC children's series was The Adventures of Rupert Bear, the first television outing for the Daily Express cartoon character. ITC (in partnership with the Italian company RAI) was also behind Franco Zeffirelli's Biblical mini-series Jesus of Nazareth, Moses the Lawgiver, and the Gregory Peck television film The Scarlet and the Black. =Films and sundry programmes= In addition to television programming, ITC also produced several films. In 1976, the company teamed up with General Cinema Corporation to form Associated General Films, and produced films including Voyage of the Damned, Capricorn One, and The Eagle Has Landed but the partnership ended the following year. Other films produced by ITC include The Boys from Brazil, The Return of the Pink Panther, The Last Unicorn, and a number of Jim Henson Company productions: The Dark Crystal and the first two Muppet films, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper. Initially, ITC productions were licensed out to other US studios for release until 1979, when ITC partnered with another UK- based production company, Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment, to create Associated Film Distribution, which would release films produced by each company, as well as pick-ups from other production companies. In 1979, the subsidiary Black Lion Films was founded in the manner of Thames Euston Films, but its best remembered production, The Long Good Friday, was sold on to HandMade Films. =The 1980s= In the summer of 1980, two films released by AFD within six weeks of each other helped lead to the distribution company's dissolution. Can't Stop the Music, designed to be a showcase for Village People at the height of disco music, was released 20 June 1980, by which time disco's popularity had diminished and the form was experiencing a backlash from music listeners. The poorly reviewed film ultimately grossed $2 million on a $20 million budget. On 1 August 1980, the release of the poorly received Raise the Titanic! met with pre-release criticism from the novel's author, Clive Cussler, and recouped only a fraction of its costs; Grade himself retired from active film production, commenting that it would have been cheaper to \\"lower the Atlantic.\\" Cussler himself told People Weekly Magazine, \\"The film was so poor, it boggles the mind.\\" After the films' failures, ITC and EMI agreed to sell AFD and the distribution rights to its library to Universal Pictures, though the AFD films which were then in post production at the time were still ultimately released by AFD, to handle the release of the remaining pictures still in production at the time of the sale, beginning with The Legend of the Lone Ranger, and including On Golden Pond, Sophie's Choice, The Dark Crystal, and The Great Muppet Caper. As January 2016 was beginning, while the various copyrights had reverted to their respective owners, Universal still maintained theatrical rights to most of the ITC and EMI films initially released by AFD. In 1983, ITC produced and released the animated series Thunderbirds 2086, which was not an original British series based on the Gerry Anderson Thunderbirds. It was actually an English dubbed version of Scientific Rescue Team Technoboyager, a Japanese anime that has an identical premise to Anderson's Thuderbirds. ITC licensed the series for an English dub and re- imagined the series as set twenty years after the original, thus being an evolution of that same International Rescue Organization. However, the Tracy family and associated characters from the Gerry Anderson Thunderbirds are never mentioned. =The 1990s= In 1990, ITC briefly attempted to enter the lucrative American game show market, with a syndicated revival of Tic-Tac- Dough, which had previously run from 1978 to 1986 in syndication, alongside Barry & Enright Productions. However, the show was off the air by March 1991, mainly due to a glut of syndicated game show offerings during the 1990-91 season, as well as several changes in gameplay which were criticised, as was host Patrick Wayne. Grade himself died in 1998. =Other= As a distribution company, ITC was also the worldwide distributor for ATV's 1967 one-off The Benny Hill Show special, but not the Thames Television series that followed. Current rights ownership Today, the underlying rights are generally owned by ITV Studios Global Entertainment via ITV plc and its respective predecessors, although in most cases Shout! Factory now holds full worldwide distribution rights (with US theatrical distribution handled by Shout!‚Äôs Westchester Films division, passed on from former distributors Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer and Park Circus). In turn, Shout!‚Äôs video distribution rights in North America to a majority of the ITC Entertainment library were assumed from Lionsgate Home Entertainment. As for ITC's television output, Carlton (and later Granada and now ITV) released some of these shows on DVD both in Europe and North America. There were however a few exceptions: The Adventures of Robin Hood and the other swashbuckling adventure series of the late 1950s and early 1960s were released on DVD by Network, as was Strange Report. Many of the drama shows from the 1960s and 1970s have since been released by Network as limited edition box sets. The Walt Disney Company has owned the Muppets franchise since 2004, including ITC productions The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie, and The Great Muppet Caper. The Jim Henson Company owns the ITC production The Dark Crystal as it had bought the film from the company after production had completed; the film is distributed on home video under license by Sony Pictures Entertainment. List of ITC Entertainment productions and distributions ITC produced and distributed a wide range of content across both film and television, over several decades. ITC productions and distributions crossed many different genres ‚Äì from historical adventure, to spy-fi and action, and later into both children's and adult science-fiction ‚Äì as well as films covering many different subjects. The ITC Distributions page offers a complete list of ITC produced and distributed programmes. =Filmography= Studios ITC had no studios of its own. Programmes were made in several facilities but most notably at ABPC's Elstree film studios (not to be confused with ATV's nearby Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood studios which was a live/videotape facility, and now known as BBC Elstree). However, the MGM-British Studios complex at Borehamwood, the Rank Organisation's Pinewood and Shepperton Studios were also used. 'Ghost Squad' was made at the Independent Artists Studio in Beaconsfield.

Murders On 16 October 2004, McAlinden, a convicted thief, prostitute, and homeless drifter, was released from prison, having served a nine-month sentence for a serious assault. She visited a top-floor flat on Dixon Avenue, in Crosshill, where her boyfriend David Gillespie, 42, lived with fellow tenant Anthony Coyle, 71, and landlord Ian Mitchell, 67, whom McAlinden referred as \\"Pops\\". An argument erupted between McAlinden and Gillespie during a drinking session, which spurred her into stabbing a knife in Gillespie's thighs repeatedly, severing a femoral vein in one thigh that caused him to bleed to death. McAlinden panicked and telephoned her son John for help. John arrived with his friend Jamie Gray by taxi. McAlinden persuaded Mitchell to pay for their taxi fare. He agreed, mistakenly believing that her son and his friend had come to help Gillespie. When John realised Mitchell was a witness, he fatally stabbed him and kicked his head repeatedly, which caused his brain to bleed heavily. Coyle escaped to his bedroom where he locked himself in. John and Jamie used a drill to remove the door locks and forced their way into the bedroom. Jamie chased Coyle and beat him to death with a golf club. Two hours later, at approximately 03:00, McAlinden went to neighbour James Sweeney's house and claimed something had happened at Ian Mitchell's flat. She begged him to check. Sweeney went to the flat and once he saw the state of the hallway, he phoned the emergency services on his mobile phone. He later revealed to local reporters that walls and floors were covered with blood, which quickly earned the killings a nickname, \\"The House of Blood.\\" Investigation When the police and paramedics arrived, they found McAlinden alone and clinging to Gillespie's body, screaming at him to wake up. McAlinden was formally charged next day, Monday 18 October, at Glasgow Sheriff Court for the murders. During the investigation, the police speculated McAlinden didn't act alone and that there were two or three strong men involved because, according to a police record during the trial, \\"there was so much blood in the flat that it was impossible to be precise about the details of the violence.\\" Two weeks later, homeless unit resident Bryan Gallagher visited a police station to file a claim that his fellow resident, John McAlinden, had boasted about the murders the night before. John McAlinden and Jamie Gray were arrested and formally charged. Trial and sentence In May 2005, Edith McAlinden, John McAlinden and Jamie Gray appeared at Glasgow High Court. All denied murdering Mitchell, Coyle, and Gillespie. During the trial, prosecutor Sean Murphy QC claimed that the victims had been \\"beaten with knives, metal files, a belt, and pieces of wood\\" and \\"hit with a bottle, punched, stabbed and stamped on the head, and had boiling water poured over them\\". The defendants changed their pleas during the trial. John McAlinden admitted he killed Mitchell, Jamie Gray admitted killing Coyle, and Edith McAlinden admitted killing Gillespie. On 29 June 2005, Edith McAlinden was sentenced to life imprisonment with an understanding that she is to serve her prison sentence until at least 2018. John McAlinden and Jamie Gray were each given a minimum tariff of 12 years.

The battle resulted in a U.S. and Filipino victory. The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations of Luzon by March 1945, although pockets of Japanese resistance held out in the mountains until the unconditional surrender of Japan. While not the highest in U.S. casualties, it is the highest net casualty battle U.S. forces fought in World War II, with 192,000 to 205,000 Japanese combatants dead (mostly from starvation and disease),Spector, Eagle Against the Sun, p. 529 8,000 American combatants killed, and over 150,000 Filipinos, overwhelmingly civilians who were murdered by Japanese forces, mainly during the Manila massacre of February, 1945. Background The Philippines were considered to be of great strategic importance because their capture by Japan would pose a significant threat to the U.S. As a result, 135,000 troops and 227 aircraft were stationed in the Philippines by October 1941. However, Luzon‚Äîthe largest island in the Philippines‚Äîwas captured by Imperial Japanese forces in 1942. General Douglas MacArthur‚Äîwho was in charge of the defense of the Philippines at the time‚Äîwas ordered to Australia, and the remaining U.S. forces retreated to the Bataan Peninsula. A few months after this, MacArthur expressed his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Chester Nimitz and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to wait two years for his wish; it was 1944 before a campaign to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of Leyte was the first objective of the campaign, which was captured by the end of December 1944. This was followed by the attack on Mindoro, and later, Luzon. Prelude Before U.S. forces could launch the attack on Luzon, a base of operation needed to be established close to the island. Airbases in particular had to be established in order to provide the advancing troops with air support. Troops under Brigadier General William C. Dunckel captured the island of Mindoro, with the assistance of the 7th Fleet. By 28 December, two airbases were controlled by the U.S. and were ready to assist in the attack on Luzon, which was scheduled to be launched on 9 January 1945. With the capture of Mindoro, U.S. forces were positioned south of Luzon. However, MacArthur intended to land his forces at Lingayen, further north. This would place his troops close to several roads and railways on Luzon, which led to Manila‚Äîthe main objective‚Äîthrough the plains in the center of the island. =Deception operations= U.S. aircraft constantly made reconnaissance and bombing flights over southern Luzon, intending to deceive the Japanese forces into believing that the attack on Luzon would come from the south. In addition, transport aircraft were used to make parachute drops with dummies. Minesweepers were used to clear the bays of Balayan, Batangas, and Tayabas, located to the south of Luzon, and Filipino resistance fighters conducted sabotage operations in southern Luzon. These deception operations failed to convince General Yamashita, the leader of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines, and he built significant defensive positions in the hills and mountains surrounding the Lingayen Gulf in Northern Luzon.

The Japanese forces reported more than 70 Allied warships entering the Lingayen Gulf. Pre-assault bombardment of Japanese shore positions from these ships began at 7:00. The landings were commenced an hour later. The landing forces faced strong opposition from Japanese kamikaze aircraft. The escort carrier was destroyed by a kamikaze attack, while a destroyer and several other warships were also sunk. Aircraft from the 3rd Fleet assisted the landings with close air support, strafing and bombing Japanese gun positions. Captain Andrade of Escuadr√≥n 201 stands in front of his P-47D with his maintenance team after returning from a combat mission over Luzon. The landings at the Lingayen Gulf on 9 January were carried out by the 6th Army under the command of General Walter Krueger. Approximately 175,000 troops from the 6th Army landed along the beachhead within a few days, while the I Corps protected their flanks. XIV Corps under General Oscar Griswold then advanced south toward Manila, despite Krueger's concerns that his eastern flank was unprotected and vulnerable if the Japanese forces attacked. However, no such attack occurred, and the U.S. forces did not meet much resistance until they reached the Clark Air Base on 23 January. The battle there lasted until the end of January, and after capturing the base, XIV Corps advanced toward Manila. The first wave of troops approaching the beaches of Luzon. A second amphibious landing took place on 15 January, southwest of Manila. On 31 January, two regiments of the 11th Airborne Division made an airborne assault, capturing a bridge, and later advanced toward Manila. On 3 February, the 1st Cavalry Division captured the bridge across Tullahan River leading to the city. They advanced into the city that evening, and the battle for the capture of Manila began. On 4 February, the paratroopers of the 11th Airborne‚Äîapproaching the city from the south‚Äîcame to the main Japanese defences south of the city of Manila where their advance was halted by heavy resistance. General Yamashita had ordered his troops to destroy all bridges and other vital installations as soon as the U.S. forces entered the city, and Japanese forces entrenched throughout the city continued to resist U.S. forces. General MacArthur announced the imminent recapture of Manila on the same day. On 11 February, the 11th Airborne Division captured the last Japanese outer defences, thus encircling the whole city. U.S. and Filipino forces carried out clearing operations in the city in the following weeks. Military casualties totalled 1,010 Americans, 3,079 Filipinos and 12,000 Japanese. Aftermath Battles continued throughout the island of Luzon in the following weeks, with more U.S. troops having landed on the island. Filipino and American resistance fighters also attacked Japanese positions and secured several locations. The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations of Luzon by early March. Small groups of the remaining Japanese forces retreated to the mountainous areas in the north and southeast of the island, where they were besieged for months. Pockets of Japanese soldiers held out in the mountains‚Äîmost ceasing resistance with the unconditional surrender of Japan, but a scattered few holding out for many years afterwards. Casualties were stunningly high for the Japanese. Japanese losses were 205,535 dead, with 9,050 taken prisoners. U.S. losses were far lower, with 8,310 killed and 29,560 wounded. Civilian casualties are estimated at 120,000 to 140,000 dead.

The territory consisted of majority-Serbian municipalities of the Republic of Croatia that declared autonomy in October 1990. It was formed as the SAO Kninska Krajina (–°–ê–û –ö–Ω–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—ò–∏–Ω–∞), but, upon inclusion of additional Serb-populated areas, changed its name simply to SAO Krajina. In 1991 the SAO Krajina declared itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina, and subsequently included the other two Serbian SAOs in Croatia, the SAO Western Slavonia and the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.  History  After the Croatian multi- party elections in 1990, ethnic tensions within Croatia increased. The Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman was planning Croatia secession from Yugoslavia, so, in anticipation, Serb leaders created an autonomous region around the city of Knin. Initially, this was dubbed the SAO Kninska Krajina, but, after joining with the Association of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika, it was renamed SAO Krajina in December 1990. In December 1990, the SAO Kninska Krajina encompassed the Community of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika. It merged with the Association of Autonomous Serb Municipalities and soon started making its own government institutions, including the Serbian National Council, a parliament for the region. Originally it was expected that Franjo Tuƒëman wanted Croatia to be a nation state within Yugoslavia after democratic and decentralizing reforms. When this turned out to be unlikely, they wanted it to be independent of Croatia but remain within the mini-Yugoslavia proposed under the Belgrade Initiative. On February 28, 1991 the SAO Krajina was officially declared. It announced that it planned to separate from Croatia if it moved for independence from Yugoslavia. The Serb National Council on March 16, 1991 declared Krajina to be independent of Croatia. On May 12, 1991 a referendum was held with over 99 percent of the vote supporting unification with Serbia. Afterwards the Krajina assembly declared that \\"the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified territory of the Republic of Serbia\\". Conflict soon began between the Krajina Serbs and Croatian authorities. After Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, violence escalated as the Serbs expanded the territory they held with the help of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), eventually to include SAO of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem and SAO Western Slavonia. The Serb-controlled territory included a third of Croatia at this point of the Croatian War of Independence. On 19 December 1991, the two SAOs through the initiative of Milan Babiƒá (president of SAO Krajina) and Goran Had≈æiƒá (president of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem) were declared as one Serbian state with the name Republic of Serbian Krajina. In February 1992, the authorities declared independence. This self-proclaimed SAO Krajina was dissolved after August 5, 1995 when Croatian armed forces reintegrated its territories into Croatia.

Built in the late 1970s and originally known as Civic Square or 'Place-Civique' in French, the building was part of an urban renewal movement toward transforming the city's visual image by investing in modern architecture.C.M. Wallace and Ashley Thomson, Sudbury: Rail Town to Regional Capital. Dundurn Press, 1993. . The square consists of a triangular main building with its right angle facing the corner of Brady and Paris Streets and a glass-walled hypoteneuse facing onto an outdoor plaza in the centre of the complex. This building contains the city hall proper, its administrative offices and the city council chambers. A diamond-shaped second building located to the west once contained the Sudbury Public School Board and the Sudbury Public Library's Archives branch. It now houses the headquarters of the Greater Sudbury Police Service. Another similar shaped but taller building housing provincial government offices was added to the northeast corner of the site several years later. Completing the square is a fourth building in similar materials, built in a rectangular shape with modern colonnade breezeway, housing Bell Canada offices. The complex was designed by the local architecture firm Townend, Stefura, Baleshta and Nicholls, with the lead architects being Arthur Townend and John Stefura. Prior to the completion of the current facility, the former city hall was so overcrowded that the civic administration was operating out of several different downtown office buildings, and council meetings had to be held in the auditorium of the Sudbury Public Library's Mackenzie branch. The facility was renamed in 1997 in honour of Tom Davies, the retiring chairman of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. In 2017, Greater Sudbury City Council began accepting bids for a construction project to redesign the complex's central plaza,\\"Bids for Tom Davies courtyard redesign come in millions over budget\\".

It bears long, flat edible beans with bright green seeds the size and shape of plump almonds which have a rather peculiar smell, similar to, but stronger than that of the shiitake mushroom, due to sulfur-containing compounds also found in shiitake, truffles and cabbage.  Botanical description  The petai tree can grow to about 30 metres. It bears flowers in a light bulb-shaped mass at the end of long stalks. The flowers secrete a nectar that attracts bats and other pollinators. The fruits emerge as long, twisted, translucent pods in a cluster of seven or eight pods. When those pods are mature, within them will reside the petai beans or seeds.  Use in cooking  The beans of other Parkia species (Parkia javanica and Parkia singalaris for example) are also popular as culinary ingredient in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, southern Thailand, Burma, and northeastern India specially Nagaland,Manipur and Mizoram, and are sold in bunches, still in the pod, or the seeds are sold in plastic bags. Pods are gathered from the wild, or from cultivated trees: they are exported in jars or cans, pickled in brine, or frozen.The Stink Bean ‚Äì A Little Smelly, A Lot of Flavor by Mark Wien in Migrationology It is known as petai, pete in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In marketplace, depending on the country of origin Parkia species may be labelled wakerec, petai, yongchak, in Thadou Jonglha (pronounced zong- lha). They are best when combined with other strongly flavoured foods such as garlic, chili peppers, dried shrimp or shrimp paste, as in sambal petai. When young, the pods are flat because the seeds have not yet developed, and they hang like a bunch of slightly twisted ribbons, pale green, almost translucent. At this stage they may be eaten raw, fried or pickled. Young tender pods with undeveloped beans can be used whole in stir-fried dishes. The seeds are also dried and seasoned for later consumption. When dried the seeds turn black. Petai beans or seeds look like broad beans. Like mature broad beans, they may have to be peeled before cooking. Petai has earned its nickname 'stink bean' because its strong smell is very pervasive. It lingers in the mouth and body. Like asparagus, it contains certain amino acids that give a strong smell to one's urine, an effect that can be noticed up to two days after consumption. Like other beans, their complex carbohydrates can also cause strong-smelling rectal gas. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, petai is very popular in the highlands of Java and Sumatra, especially among Sundanese, Minangkabau and many other people in different cultures of the island. In Sundanese cuisine petai might be eaten raw with sambal as part of lalab, fried or grilled. It also can be stir fried and mixed with oncom. In Java and Sumatra, it also might be added to sayur lodeh or sambal goreng ati petai (fried diced beef or chicken liver in sambal and petai). Nasi goreng kambing petai is popular variant of nasi goreng (fried rice) with goat meat and petai. In Minangkabau cuisine it usually become part of lado (Minang sambal) for ayam pop (Padang style fried chicken). =India= In Manipur, it is grown mainly on all the hilly districts especially Kuki inhabited areas, who called it Jonglha, Hmar tribes call it Zawng·π≠a It is grown in the hill district of Hm√¢rbiel and some other parts of Manipur valley. Varieties found here are somewhat harder than the counterparts of Thailand or Malaysia. The wild variety from the hills is more commonly sold in market. Some species of Parkia are grown in small scale by farmers in northeast India. In mainland India, it is grown as an ornamental plant, shade tree and border tree. This bean has become an important ingredient in many food items in Tripura too. In Manipur, the seeds or the bean as a whole are eaten by preparing a local delicacy called Hmarcha d√™ng, Eromba or Yongchaak singju (salad).Spicy Manipuri Salad in The Taste of Food Eromba is a very common cuisine in Manipur made with boiled potato, fermented fish, chili and other vegetables, in this case, Parkia. Yongchaak singju is another favourite side dish made with Parkia cut into small pieces and then mixed with red hot chili paste. Parkia is also used for making various other dishes with fish and vegetables.The Kuki Tribe,a tribe from North-East India, called it \\"Jonglha\\" and relished it with almost like a special vegetable. Rongmei Tribe of Manipur, Nagaland and Assam call it Kampai which is cooked with meat or prepared as salad, and sometimes seeds are eaten with Chattni made of dry fish. The Hmar tribe of Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur call it Zawng·π≠a (pronounced Zongtra) and mainly prepare it with chilli, Sodium Bi- carbonate, little amount of salt and a special fermented pork called \\"Saum\\"(sa means meat,um means fermented) and called it Zawng·π≠a-r√¢wt. In Mizoram, the Mizo people are also very fond of it, and call it Zawng·π≠ah and they use to prepare it with chili and a fermented pork called Saum which is the same as 'sathu' of Manipur. In Manipur, Assam, Tripura, the (Tripura people call it Wakerec mosedang) and Bangladesh Manipuris call it Yongchak or wakerec in the local manipuri dialect and consume it as a salad mixed with fermented fish or, the boiled or roasted seeds either alone or in a mash of boiled vegetables laced with fermented fish. =Malaysia & Singapore= In Malaysia and Singapore, petai is also commonly served with sambal, or mixed with dried shrimp, chili peppers, red onions, belacan (prawn paste), soy sauce and prawn. =Thailand= In Thailand it is called sah-taw (), as mu phat sah-taw, stink bean with stir fried pork.

The book titled A Mother's Offering to her Children: By a Lady, Long Resident in New South Wales. Sydney: Gazette Office was published in 1841. Anonymously published, the book was originally attributed to Lady J.J. Gordon Bremer, the wife of Sir James John Gordon Bremer. However, extensive research by Marcie Muir supports its attribution to Charlotte Barton. Early life Charlotte Waring was born in 1796 and christened on 13 March 1796 at St Mary's, Marylebone, London. Her parents were Albert Waring and his wife Elizabeth Turner.  Arrival, and life, in Australia  In 1826 Charlotte Waring came to New South Wales to take up a position as governess to the family of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur. She became engaged during the voyage to James Atkinson, a highly respected agriculturalist and author of the first substantial book on Australian farming. They married in 1827. The couple settled at Atkinson's property Oldbury in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. They had four children, including the author and naturalist Caroline Louisa Waring Calvert (n√©e Atkinson). The children appear, slightly disguised, as the four children of the book. Charlotte's father, Thomas Albert Waring, died in 1829. She is mentioned in his will as the wife of James Atkinson in NSW. James Atkinson died in 1834, and Charlotte married Oldbury's overseer George Bruce Barton in March 1836. He became insane and Charlotte was forced to separate from him. Barton had a history of alcoholism and violence, and was eventually convicted of manslaughter in Bathurst in 1854. Charlotte left Oldbury with her children bound for Budgong and later moved to Sydney. Her guardianship of her children was resoundingly confirmed as of 6 July 1841 in a decision by C.J. Dowling of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. > It being made manifest, therefore, that Mrs. Barton is herself competent to > educate her children either by herself or by any competent assistance under > her own eye, it would require a state of urgent circumstances to induce the > Court to deprive them (all of whom are under thirteen years of age) of that > maternal care and tenderness, which none but a mother can bestow. After winning legal custody of her children, Charlotte returned to Oldbury, where she died in 1867.  A Mother's Offering  A Mother's Offering, which predates subsequent Australian literature for the young by a decade, is written in the genre of children's conversation textbooks, a dialogue between mother and children, reflecting the importance of family conversation to education in the home in the nineteenth century, and follows the pattern of literature by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in its expository question-and-answer format concluding in pious moralising. It is not a dull tract however; Charlotte drew on her own experiences in the colony, and probably on actual conversations with her children, in preparing a stimulating, often exciting text that presents children with local adventures and Australian heroes for the first time. It is an excellent example of the influence women had on the community through the education of their children, though the children's questions and reactions are gendered; Clara being interested in botany and Julius in hunting. The book covers a variety of topics, from natural history, often as an example for human morality, to geology, shipwrecks and the customs of the Australian Aborigines. Some parts are quite lurid, such as her description of the wreck of the Charles Eaton, a ship that went down in the Torres Strait in 1834. It was claimed that many children survived the shipwreck only to be eaten by cannibals. She describes Aboriginal 'monsters' and their 'wanton barbarities' in her A Mother's Offering account of shipwrecked Eliza Fraser's treatment, which she explains is a result of Islanders and aborigines being more prone to 'unrestrained passions' than the British. Life's dangers were a frequent theme of 19th-century Australian children's fiction. And yet there is scientific understanding evident in her accounting for explosions heard in the bush 'as loud as cannon' with reference to theories of Sir John Herschel. The book was published by George William Evans (1780‚Äì1852), a surveyor who had arrived in Port Jackson in 1802. He led the expedition which crossed the Great Dividing Range in 1813. He returned to England in 1826 but came back to Australia in 1832 and set up as a bookseller and stationer.  As a collector's item  The book is very rare and it commands high prices; in April 2005 a copy fetched $48,000.

During the twelfth century a round defensive tower was built on Kalmarsund and a harbour constructed. At the end of the thirteenth century King Magnus Ladul√•s had a new fortress built with a curtain wall, round corner towers and two square gatehouses surrounding the original tower. Located near the site of Kalmar's medieval harbor, it has played a crucial part in Swedish history since its initial construction as a fortified tower in the 12th century. One of the most significant political events in Scandinavia took place at Kalmar Castle in 1397, when the Kalmar Union was formed - a union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (including Finland), organized by Queen Margaret I of Denmark. During the Swedish rebellion against Denmark in 1520, the fortress was commanded by Anna Eriksdotter (Bielke), who at the death of her spouse, Johan M√•nsson Natt och Dag, in the middle of the rebellion against Denmark in 1520, took control over his fiefs and defended Kalmar against Denmark.Kalmar Castle (Castle of the Day) The fortress was improved during the 16th century under the direction of King Gustav I and his sons King Eric XIV and King John III, who turned the medieval fortress into a castle fit for a renaissance king. Kalmar Castle suffered heavy damage during the Kalmar War of 1611-13 and was badly damaged by a fire in 1642. Repairs were begun but from the end of the seventeenth century the castle was allowed to fall into disrepair. The castle before its latest reconstruction Restoration In 1856, architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander (1816‚Äì1881) initiated reconstruction/restoration work at Kalmar Castle. His pupil Helgo Zettervall continued restoring Kalmar Castle in the 1880s. Architect Carl M√∂ller drew up the plans and other documents. The work began in 1885 and by 1891 the castle had gained the silhouette it bears today. In 1919 professor Martin Olsson was charged with the continuing restoration of earthworks, the moat, the bridge and the drawbridge. Work continued until 1941, when the castle was once more surrounded by water. Today, it is one of Sweden's best preserved renaissance castles and is open to the public.Kalmar Castle: Sweden‚Äôs Royal Hub (Smithsonian Institution) References Other sources *Kaufmann, J.E.

He is a pundit on Swedish TV channel SVT, as part of their football coverage. Nannskog was known for being a hard working, determined player who worked for the team by not only scoring goals but creating them as well. On 23 November 2010, he announced his retirement. Club career =Sweden= Daniel started up at H√∂gaborg, a small football club from his home city Helsingborg in Scania, the southernmost of Sweden, as a young boy. However, from the age 15 he quit football to concentrate on handball. After some persuasion, he started to play football again at the age of 19. After his comeback, he played two seasons for H√∂gaborg, before switching to Allsvenskan side Malm√∂ FF. His time at the club was not particular successful, but a goal he scored for them was very important as it sent Malm√∂ to the UEFA Cup. The next seasons were spent in Swedish second tier, the Superettan. When he was 27, he was brought to Landskrona BoIS, by current Stab√¶k coach Janne J√∂nsson. His first season there they reached second place and got promoted, with Nannskog as the league's top scorer with 21 goals. He followed Landskrona up to Allsvenskan and did very well, becoming the club's top scorer with 11 goals, playing an important part in them finishing just above relegation play-off. In the middle of the Swedish 2003 season, he moved on to China. Nannskog played for Swedish Landskrona BoIS from 2001 when the club played in second tier Superettan. He was involved in the promotion of Landskrona BoIS to Swedish top tier league, Allsvenskan. And his success continued during the following year. Already in the first match, Nannskog scored a goal as Landskrona BoIS in a remarkable match defeated their old rivals Helsingborgs IF as Landskrona BoIS won 6‚Äì2 in front of an attendance of 12.000 at Landskrona IP. Together with BoIS' other forward, Danijel Milovanoviƒá, both of them became a feared top-duo that led their recently promoted club to the top position of Allsvenskan at the break for the World Cup in Japan and South Korea. After the eight first matches, Landskrona BoIS had won five matches, drawn three times and never lost. When forward colleague Milovanoviƒá got seriously injured against rivals Malm√∂ FF (an injury from which Milovanoviƒá never recovered), this surprising success ended for Nannskog's club, but Nannskog himself continued to score. =Sichuan Guancheng= Nannskog left Landskrona BoIS in summer of 2003 to join the Chinese club Sichuan Guancheng on a two-year deal. He went on to stay for a year-and a half, but terminated his contract in order to play for his old coach Janne J√∂nsson at Stab√¶k in the 2005 season. =Stab√¶k= 2005‚Äì2007 His first season at Stab√¶k was very successful, with his club being promoted in style. \\"The Body\\" Nannskog was also named top scorer with 27 goals in 29 games. Nannskog and fellow striker Veigar P√°ll Gunnarsson applauding the fans after a match against V√•lerenga in June 2006. Nannskogs debut in the Norwegian top division was successful. They finished fifth, just outside an UEFA Cup spot. Nannskog was crowned top scorer with his 19 goals, one goal ahead of team-mate Veigar P√°ll Gunnarsson. Nannskog and Stab√¶k continued their progress, and for a second time in a row, he managed to score 19 goals, but this time finishing behind Brann's Torstein Helstad, who scored 22. However, Stab√¶k did better in the league, finishing second behind Brann. They were in front half way, but did not have the edge in the second part of the season. 2008‚Äì2010 Stab√¶k have played well in the first part of the 2008 season with Nannskog an integral part, like when he scored two goals in the away match against Ham-Kam (2‚Äì0 victory) in round 5 . The Norwegian media felt it was time the Swedish national team took a look at him again with a possible inclusion in the Euro 2008 squad, following his winning goal against Rosenborg on 4 May. However, he did not make the squad. On 14 September Nannskog scored four goals in a 6‚Äì0 victory over Str√∏msgodset, taking him to the top of the goal scoring chart with 13 goals ‚Äì helping Stab√¶k with a six- point advantage with six rounds to go. On 24 September, Nannskog scored two goals and made one assist in the semifinal of the Norwegian Cup, helping Stab√¶k to a 3‚Äì0 victory over Molde. A few days later, on 29 September Nannskog scored his 99th and 100th goal against Molde. This time in a league match. Stab√¶k won the league in stylish fashion. Nannskog was crowned top scorer of the league with his 16 goals, four more than fellow team-mate and swede Johan Andersson. He was denied 'the double' as they lost in the Norwegian Cup final against V√•lerenga. Nannskog during a training session with Stab√¶k in February 2009. On 8 March Stab√¶k claimed their first trophy of the season when they won the Norwegian Superfinal against last season's cup winners V√•lerenga by 3 goals to 1 with Nannskog scoring the opener. Nannskog scored a hat-trick on 5 April as Stab√¶k turned 1‚Äì3 to a 3‚Äì3 draw in the third league round. Nannskog was injured for just over a month before making a comeback on 24 May, scoring a brace in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Start in the Tippeligaen. He soon got injured again and so far only restricted him to 11 league games this season (5 goals). In total, Nannskog scored 123 goals in 172 games for Stab√¶k in all competitions. Nannskog failed to return from his injuries and subsequently retired from football. International career His debut for the Swedish national team came 14 January 2007 against Venezuela. His first goal for his national team came against Ecuador on 21 January 2007, in a game which ended 1‚Äì1. In January 2009 Nannskog was called up to the Swedish squad to face the United States and Mexico during their annual North-American tour. On 25 January 2009, Nannskog scored his second goal for Sweden in a 3‚Äì2 loss against the United States. =International goals= :As of match played 1 April 2009.

It involves systematic use of a domain-specific language to represent the various facets of a system. Domain-specific modeling languages tend to support higher-level abstractions than general-purpose modeling languages, so they require less effort and fewer low-level details to specify a given system.  Overview  Domain-specific modeling often also includes the idea of code generation: automating the creation of executable source code directly from the domain- specific language models. Being free from the manual creation and maintenance of source code means domain-specific language can significantly improve developer productivity.Kelly, S. and Tolvanen, J.-P., (2008) Domain-Specific Modeling: Enabling Full Code Generation, John Wiley & Sons, New Jersey. The reliability of automatic generation compared to manual coding will also reduce the number of defects in the resulting programs thus improving quality. Domain-specific language differs from earlier code generation attempts in the CASE tools of the 1980s or UML tools of the 1990s. In both of these, the code generators and modeling languages were built by tool vendors. While it is possible for a tool vendor to create a domain-specific language and generators, it is more normal for domain-specific language to occur within one organization. One or a few expert developers creates the modeling language and generators, and the rest of the developers use them. Having the modeling language and generator built by the organization that will use them allows a tight fit with their exact domain and in response to changes in the domain. Domain-specific languages can usually cover a range of abstraction levels for a particular domain. For example, a domain-specific modeling language for mobile phones could allow users to specify high-level abstractions for the user interface, as well as lower-level abstractions for storing data such as phone numbers or settings. Likewise, a domain-specific modeling language for financial services could permit users to specify high-level abstractions for clients, as well as lower-level abstractions for implementing stock and bond trading algorithms. Domain-specific modeling is also helpful to reason about low-level software artifacts.  Topics  = Defining domain-specific languages = To define a language, one needs a language to write the definition in. The language of a model is often called a metamodel, hence the language for defining a modeling language is a meta-metamodel. Meta-metamodels can be divided into two groups: those that are derived from or customizations of existing languages, and those that have been developed specifically as meta-metamodels. Derived meta-metamodels include entity relationship diagrams, formal languages, extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF), ontology languages, XML schema, and Meta-Object Facility (MOF). The strengths of these languages tend to be in the familiarity and standardization of the original language. The ethos of domain-specific modeling favors the creation of a new language for a specific task, and so there are unsurprisingly new languages designed as meta- metamodels. The most widely used family of such languages is that of OPRR,R.J. Welke. The CASE Repository: More than another database application. In W.W. Cotterman and J.A. Senn, editors, Proceedings of 1988 INTEC Symposium Systems Analysis and Design: A Research Strategy, Atlanta, Georgia, 1988. Georgia State University.

GOPRR,Kelly, S., Lyytinen, K., and Rossi, M., \\"MetaEdit+: A Fully Configurable Multi-User and Multi-Tool CASE Environment,\\" Proceedings of CAiSE'96, 8th Intl. Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1080, Springer-Verlag, pp. 1-21, 1996. (in Ph.D. thesis as 3metools.pdf) and GOPPRR, which focus on supporting things found in modeling languages with the minimum effort. = Tool support for domain-specific languages = Many General-Purpose Modeling languages already have tool support available in the form of CASE tools. Domain-specific language languages tend to have too small a market size to support the construction of a bespoke CASE tool from scratch. Instead, most tool support for domain-specific language languages is built based on existing domain-specific language frameworks or through domain- specific language environments. A domain-specific language environment may be thought of as a metamodeling tool, i.e., a modeling tool used to define a modeling tool or CASE tool. The resulting tool may either work within the domain-specific language environment, or less commonly be produced as a separate stand-alone program. In the more common case, the domain-specific language environment supports an additional layer of abstraction when compared to a traditional CASE tool. Using a domain-specific language environment can significantly lower the cost of obtaining tool support for a domain-specific language, since a well-designed domain-specific language environment will automate the creation of program parts that are costly to build from scratch, such as domain-specific editors, browsers and components. The domain expert only needs to specify the domain specific constructs and rules, and the domain-specific language environment provides a modeling tool tailored for the target domain. Most existing domain-specific language takes place with domain- specific language environments, either commercial such as MetaEdit+ or Actifsource, open source such as GEMS, or academic such as GME. The increasing popularity of domain-specific language has led to domain-specific language frameworks being added to existing IDEs, e.g. Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP) with EMF and GMF, or in Microsoft's DSL Tools for Software Factories.  Domain-specific language and UML  The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language for software-intensive systems that is designed to support mostly object oriented programming. Consequently, in contrast to domain-specific language languages, UML is used for a wide variety of purposes across a broad range of domains. The primitives offered by UML are those of object oriented programming, while domain-specific languages offer primitives whose semantics are familiar to all practitioners in that domain. For example, in the domain of automotive engineering, there will be software models to represent the properties of an anti-lock braking system, or a steering wheel, etc. UML includes a profile mechanism that allows it to be constrained and customized for specific domains and platforms. UML profiles use stereotypes, stereotype attributes (known as tagged values before UML 2.0), and constraints to restrict and extend the scope of UML to a particular domain. Perhaps the best known example of customizing UML for a specific domain is SysML, a domain specific language for systems engineering.

A Grammy Award winner, he is from New Orleans, Louisiana. He is also a prolific and provocative writer who comments on a multitude of subjects, including music, race, politics, and life in America. Biography The son of bassist and sousaphonist Walter Payton, he took up the trumpet at the age of four and by age nine was sitting in with the Young Tuxedo Brass Band alongside his father. He began his professional career at ten years old as a member of James Andrews' All-Star Brass and was given his first steady gig by guitarist Danny Barker at The Famous Door on Bourbon Street. He enrolled at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and then at the University of New Orleans. After touring with Marcus Roberts and Elvin Jones in the early '90s, Payton signed a contract with Verve Records; his first album, From This Moment, appeared in 1995. In 1996 he performed on the soundtrack of the movie Kansas City, and in 1997 received a Grammy Award (Best Instrumental Solo) for his playing on the album Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton. After seven albums on Verve, Payton signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing Sonic Trance, his first album on the new label, in 2003. Besides his recordings under his own name, other significant collaborations include Trey Anastasio, Ray Brown, Ray Charles, Daniel Lanois, Dr. John, Stanley Jordan, Herbie Hancock, Roy Haynes, Zigaboo Modeliste, Marcus Roberts, Jill Scott, Clark Terry, Allen Toussaint, Nancy Wilson, Dr. Michael White, and Joe Henderson. In 2004, he became a founding member of the SFJAZZ Collective. In 2008, he joined The Blue Note 7, a septet formed in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. In 2011, he formed a 21-piece big band ensemble called the Television Studio Orchestra. In 2011, he also recorded and released Bitches, a love narrative on which he played every instrument, sang, and wrote all of the music. In 2012 the Czech National Symphony Orchestra commissioned and debuted his first full orchestral work, The Black American Symphony. And in 2013, he formed his own record label, BMF Records, and the same year released two albums, #BAM Live at Bohemian Caverns, where he plays both trumpet and Fender Rhodes, often at once, and Sketches of Spain, which he recorded with the Basel Symphony Orchestra in Switzerland.

Originally the Richmond iron steam tug James Gray, built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1858, Lady Davis was purchased in March 1861 by Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens of South Carolina, who armed her and placed in command Lieutenant William Gaillard Dozier, South Carolina Navy, with orders to thwart reinforcement of Fort Sumter by Union troops. On May 7, 1861 Lady Davis was purchased by the Confederacy for $32,000 and commissioned in the Confederate Navy, operating thereafter along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Lieutenant Thomas P. Pelot, CSN, took command about 5 days later, relieving Lieutenant Edward Cantey Stockton, South Carolina Navy. At that time, the little gunboat served as flagship of Commodore Josiah Tattnall's Savannah Defense Squadron, consisting of CSS Savannah, CSS Sampson and CSS Resolute. On May 19, Lady Davis began her career with distinction by capturing and taking into Beaufort, South Carolina the A. B. Thompson, a full- rigged ship of 980 tons and a crew of 23 out of Brunswick, Maine, whom she encountered off Savannah while on an expedition seeking the U.S. armed brig Perry. The exploit culminated in acrimonious litigation to decide whether an Army captain and a dozen of his soldiers should share in the prize money. Captain Stephen Elliott, Jr., CSA, happened to be on board and acted as pilot during the capture and afterward, while his men claimed to have helped bring in the prize. On the following day, the crew were reenlisted into the Confederate States Navy, the State officers being replaced by regulars between then and June 1. Lady Davis's rifled gun remained the property of South Carolina, on loan, while the other, a 24-pounder howitzer, was a gift outright to the Confederacy. By November, Lieutenant John Rutledge commanded her. She joined in the battle of Port Royal, South Carolina on November 7, 1861. Although her engines were transferred to CSS Palmetto State late in 1862, well built iron hulls were in great demand and she was able to continue her successful career as a privately owned blockade runner out of Charleston, South Carolina. With the occupation of Charleston in 1865 by Federal forces, Lady Davis was captured and turned over to the Light House Board by Admiral John A. Dahlgren, who praised her hull, while noting that she was, again, minus her machinery, whose disposition is not recorded.

She was named for Marie Antoinette. Queen of France was an old ship purchased in France in 1777 by American commissioners, Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, and fitted out as a 28-gun frigate. She was in Boston Harbor by December 1778. In a squadron commanded by Captain John Burroughs Hopkins, Queen of France, commanded by Captain Joseph Olney, departed Boston, Massachusetts 13 March 1779. She cruised along the Atlantic coast as far south as Charleston, South Carolina to destroy small armed vessels operating out of New York to prey upon American shipping. Near dawn 6 April, some 16 miles east of Cape Henry, Virginia, they sighted schooner Hibernia, a 10-gun privateer, and took her after a short chase. At about the same time the next morning, the American warships saw a fleet of 9 sails and pursued them until catching their quarry that afternoon.

Three of the prizes were later recaptured, but the eight which reached Boston with the squadron late in August were sold for over a million dollars. Queen of France departed Boston with frigates and , and sloop Ranger, on 23 November and cruised east of Bermuda. They took 12-gun privateer Dolphin on 5 December before arriving Charleston, on the 23rd. Queen of France was sunk at Charleston to avoid falling into British hands when that city surrendered 11 May 1780. As of 2012, no other ship has been named Queen of France.

The game was published by Taito in Japan on December 25, 2003. It was released North America by BAM! Entertainment and in Europe by 505 Games on July 22, 2004 and February 18, 2005 respectively. Bujingai is set in the 23rd century, about 100 years after a global catastrophe wiped out a majority of the Earth's population and its entire government. The survivors have found themselves in possession of magical powers stemming from the energies of the Earth. The game's story follows one such man, Lau Wong, a sword-wielding exile who returns to Earth to confront a former ally and an army of demons who have taken hold of the titular Asian city of Bujingai. The graphics and gameplay in Bujingai are visually inspired by martial arts (Wuxia) films of Hong Kong. The game is a third-person beat 'em up/hack and slash in which the player controls the protagonist Lau, exploring open environments, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies and bosses. The game features a counterattack mechanic and the ability to chain together sword slashes in excess of 1,000 hits. Bujingai acted as a 50th anniversary release for Taito. Taking two years to create, the development team included Taito veteran Hiroshi Aoki as director, Taito's in- house band Zuntata as music composers, and external talent in the form of Cowboy Bebop character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto and Trigun scenario writer Y≈çsuke Kuroda in their respective roles. The likeness of Japanese pop icon Gackt was used in making the protagonist Lau Wong; Gackt himself aided in the game's promotion prior to its launch. Bujingai received above-average reviews from press sources, who praised its combat gameplay, visual style, and character designs. However, many of these same reviewers criticized the game as having poor jumping mechanics, dull level designs, and a weak plot. Plot Set in the 23rd century, Bujingai begins 100 years after an accident involving an environmentally-friendly energy source annihilated 70 percent of the world's population and all of its government. Those who survived found themselves with special abilities harnessed through the energies of the Earth itself, which they honed into a discipline of magic and swordplay. A mysterious and powerful human exile, Lau Wong, returns to the planet to battle his former friend and training partner Rei Jenron, who has been possessed by an evil spirit. Rei has kidnapped the soul of his once-beloved Yohfa and opened numerous portals, allowing demons to overtake the Asian city of Bujingai. Lau stands as the only one capable of stopping Rei and the demons threatening the world's remaining population. Gameplay The player character battles an enemy. Health and defense meters for the player and enemy are displayed top left and top right respectively. The player's magic meter is on the bottom left and collected blue orbs on the bottom right. Bujingai is a third-person beat 'em up/hack and slash game where the player controls the protagonist Lau, exploring different environments, completing minor objectives, and battling numerous enemies and more powerful end-stage bosses. The player can attack with dual-wielded swords, jump, spin, execute magical abilities, or perform any combination of the aforementioned abilities. The game contains a large number of combination attacks, some of which can be chained together in excess of 1,000 hits on a single adversary. While in combat, the player will automatically block an enemy's strike if facing their direction. However, a defense meter for both Lau and his enemy will deplete after each blow is exchanged; only when the defense meter is emptied can any real damage be incurred. Bujingai allows the player to counter an assailant as well. By timing it with an attack of their own, the camera will cut away to a fixed, posed shot of Lau, then allowing the player to deal heavy damage to the foe. Some tougher enemies like mid-stage bosses are, in turn, adept at countering Lau in a similar fashion. Bujingai offers the player a number of magic spells ranging from a basic fireball to a powerful whirlwind foray. These spells are dependent on a magic meter which can be refilled by picking up power-ups or successfully dicing up enemies. The gameplay in Bujingai is visually styled akin to Hong Kong martial arts (Wuxia) films with colorful sword-slashes, spinning aerial jousts, and gliding. Alongside basic jumping, the player can tap the appropriate button again to glide through the air or run along a wall. These abilities are key to solving puzzles and navigating certain levels. By defeating enemies and busting up destructable objects, the player can collect blue orbs, which can be exchanged at the end of each stage to upgrade Lau's health, defense, magic meter or magic attacks. Bonuses can also be earned depending on how well the player performs in each level, dependent on factors such as completion time, the amount of damage taken, the number of continues used, and \\"stylized action points\\". Collecting hidden coins within stages allow for additional bonuses. Development Bujingai was developed as a joint venture between Taito Corporation and Red Entertainment, with the game representing a 50th anniversary release for Taito. Bujingai was directed and chiefly designed by Hiroshi Aoki. The game's characters were designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto, whose previous credits include the anime television series Cowboy Bebop and Wolf's Rain. Y≈çsuke Kuroda, the game's scenario writer, worked on series including Please Teacher!, s-CRY-ed, and Trigun. The game's music was composed by members of Zuntata, Taito's in-house band: Katsuhisa Ishikawa acted as sound director and composed the game's sound effects while Hideki Takahagi composed the background music. The likeness of Japanese pop icon Gackt was used to create Bujingai protagonist Lau Wong with CG models and motion capture. Though Gackt does not speak any actual lines (with the exception of some lines for gameplay) as Lau, fellow voice actors K≈çichi Yamadera, Maaya Sakamoto, and Norio Wakamoto provide a generous amount of dialogue as supporting characters in the game. Bujingai took about two years total to develop, with the first six months devoted to pre-production. Producer Keisaku Okumura explained that it was a challenge to make a universally accepted collaboration between Taito, an old corporation with a large imprint on the history of the Japanese arcade industry, and Red Entertainment, a younger \\"hooligan\\" company. The developers discussed with Taito at the project's outset about surpassing traditional Hong Kong cinema, specifically its martial arts films. Aoki's goal was to make the game unique among other action titles like Shinobi and Nightshade by implementing intuitive controls, responsive enemies, and faithfully reproduced swordplay. Kuroda expanded on the setting ideas of the game as first presented by Aoki. Kuroda had never work on an action genre game before, but found it the writing relatively easy, creating \\"a unique game that would appeal to consumers while still including some of [his] own interests\\". Kuroda noted the finished product as \\"a game with an 'Asian flavor' as seen through Japanese eyes\\". The team had no particular theme when designing Lau and his antagonists at the start, but gradually focused on character silhouettes; imagery using mythological creatures like the dragon and phoenix; and \\"beauty of the flow of action during the sword fighting scenes\\". Release Bujingai was first announced in an August 2003 issue of Enterbrain's Weekly Famitsu magazine after the game was about 50 percent complete. Bujingai was first presented on August 28 at a 50th anniversary commemoration event for Taito. In the months leading up to its release, the game was demonstrated by the development staff at Japanese tradeshows, notably the Tokyo Game Show and Games Japan Festa in Osaka. Gackt's popularity was instrumental in promoting the game prior to its release, with the star personally demonstrating the gameplay during press events. The game even contains unlockable features including a costume that will change Lau's clothing to those worn by Gackt, as well as exclusive interviews with the star and the game's voice cast. Bujingai officially went to retail in Japan on December 25, 2003. Various pieces of related merchandise were sold alongside the game. They include an official guidebook published by Enterbrain, an art book published by Shinkigensha, and a soundtrack CD released by Zuntata Records. A manga series based on the game was written by screenwriter Kuroda, illustrated by Kenichi Rou, and serialized in Kodansha's Magazine Z starting May 26, 2004. BAM! Entertainment picked up the publishing rights for the game in January 2004. Taito's overseas division selected the publisher based on its knowledge of the North American market. The publisher added the subtitle The Forsaken City and planned to release the game in May of that year. However, this localized version saw a slight delay, making an appearance at the publisher's booth at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in early June. BAM! announced on June 10, 2004 that the game had been submitted for Sony approval. The game was finally made available at North American retailers on July 22, 2004. Sources including Computer and Video Games and GamesIndustry.biz issued news statements that Bujingai would be published by Atari in the United Kingdom in February 2005. The game was instead published throughout Europe by 505 Gamestreet under the title Bujingai: Swordmaster. Reception Critical reception for Bujingai has been generally above-average among both print and online sources. The game has accrued aggregate scores of 73% on GameRankings and 72 out of 100 on Metacritic. Critics have found the combat gameplay enjoyable and rewarding, positively comparing it to other titles in its genre including the Devil May Cry series, Shinobi, Nightshade, Otogi: Myth of Demons, and Ninja Gaiden. GamesTM summarized, \\"Spend time mastering the fighting system, powering up your various attacks and revisiting stages to improve your combo scores and the game becomes so much more than just a basic hack-and-slash romp - it's a feast of replayable swordplay.\\" GamePro stated the gameplay is \\"both surprisingly deep and unfortunately simple\\", lamenting that blocking, parrying, and counterattacking belies the ability to button mash one's way through most battles. IGN's Jeremy Dunham also noted Bujingai to have a simplistic gameplay model beneath its stylized visual presentation, but still celebrated it as \\"challenging, fast, and easy to learn\\". Reviewers have criticized the game's camera system and its jumping and gliding gameplay, referring to these mechanics as \\"simplistic\\", unresponsive, \\"impossible\\", \\"awkward\\", and \\"purely frustrating\\". Assessments on the visuals of Bujingai have been fairly consistent. Dunham stated the game's visuals as \\"top of the line\\" by virtue of its textures, character designs, pyrotechnic effects, and a \\"silky smooth\\" frame rate. Navarro equivalently touted the visuals as its \\"strongest asset\\". GameSpot contributor Alex Navarro argued that despite not being the most graphically-advanced game available for the PS2 during its release, the game will impress players with Kawamoto's character designs and the protagonist Lau's cinematic flair. Joe Juba of Game Informer similarly enjoyed the game's character designs and action sequences, discovering within it a \\"unique sense of style, reminiscent of Hong Kong cinema, [permeating] every aspect\\". The three writers' views somewhat differed for game's level designs. Dunham labeled the environments distinctly unique, boasting \\"everything from blizzard-ridden mountaintops and dusty desert castles to abandoned city streets and misty bamboo forests\\". Navarro found these environments appealing, but disliked their consistent lack of detail and a linearity that renders the directional radar useless. Juba simply called both the enemies and environments boring. Staff reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, and PSM agreed on the environments being bland. The sound design in Bujingai received mixed criticism. Dunham appreciated the game's soundtrack, describing it as an \\"Asian fusion of traditional Chinese music with heavy metal\\". Dunham was overall satisfied with the English voicework and sound effects. Navarro called sound component (in contrast to its visuals) the game's \\"weakest asset\\", designating it with standard dub work, typical Japanese music, and unremarkable sound effects. The plot of Bujingai has been almost universally criticized, with reviewers describing it as \\"near nonexistent\\", \\"barely there\\", \\"weak\\", and one that \\"no one reads and characters no one gives a rip about to make it interesting\\". Contrarily, Dunham stated that although the game's storyline is \\"obviously entrenched in the same cookie cutter mold that powers just about every other action-oriented game and movie nowadays\\", its completion \\"should leave it viewers with at least some form of positive satisfaction\\". Legacy Media Create sales information shows that Bujingai ranked 19th among all video game releases in Japan during its debut week, selling 43,116 copies. The game sold an additional 51,549 copies in Japan throughout 2004. Prior to the game's North American launch, Taito had considered creating a sequel. Okumura explained, \\"As long as the energy of the fans remains, Bujingai 2 will see the light of day!! For sure!\\" Despite the game's positive reception, Bujingai did not receive a console follow-up. According to a statement by Aoki in 2010, \\"the company wanted to go in certain directions... I did want to make more, but anyway, it didn't really happen\\". On March 31, 2006, South Korean film distributor SidusHQ announced that it had acquired the rights to publish a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on Bujingai, developed by Besttoday. Besttoday CEO Jeon Jun Woo announced at ChinaJoy in July of that year that the game was in full development with plans for release in the third quarter of 2007. However, no other news of the game has since been issued.

Religious groups  A number of religious groups were at the forefront of calls for restraint in the rhetoric on both sides of the debate. Others gave qualified approval, endorsing the bill's attempts to promote reconciliation but opposing its amnesty provisions. At various points, calls for restraint and dialogue came from Father Beniamino Kaloudau, the Vicar-General of the Roman Catholic Church in Fiji, the Prison Fellowship ministry, the Plymouth Brethren denomination, the Fiji Council of Churches, and the Indian Division of the Methodist Church. The Assemblies of God, for their part, endorsed the reconciliation proposals, but expressed deep reservations about the amnesty clauses. Rev. Ame Tugaue, General Secretary of the Methodist Church, the nation's largest denomination comprising some 36 percent of the total population, including 66 percent of indigenous Fijians, said on 9 July that the church was reserving judgement on the bill itself until it could finish consulting its members, but was emphatically opposed to discontinuing the process of law. On 19 October, however, he reversed this position, emphatically endorsed the bill, and criticized members of the church who opposed it.  Businesspeople and organizations  * Taito Waradi, president of the Fijian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also said he supported the need for reconciliation, but called the proposed legislation a \\"man-made law\\" that would not work unless preceded by fundamental social changes. On the one hand, indigenous Fijians needed to be integrated into the economic life of the country in order to break the \\"vicious cycle\\" of unrest and instability, he said on 18 May. On the other hand, he insisted that it was necessary to promote and reinforce moral values. \\"No amount of legislation can guarantee lasting peace and stability if the people it is supposed to serve are not spiritually and emotionally prepared to live by them and where necessary defend them with their lives when it is breached. Basic moral values must therefore first be internalised in the hearts and minds of its people before we can hope to enforce legislation reflecting these values. We cannot begin to observe man-made laws if we do not have any moral values to start off with in the first place,\\" he said. Waradi suggested that rather than try to impose national reconciliation by legislative fiat, it would be better for the government to proclaim a National Conscience Week for the people to examine their hearts and come together to map out a way forward. * Santal Maharaj of the New Zealand-based Fiji Human Rights Groups (NZ) said on 17 June that his organization supported the intentions of the bill, but was concerned that there was no precise definition of political crimes or victims. \\"We agree with the good intentions of the Bill but the definitions of crimes of a political nature and the definition of victims arising out of political circumstances and of political nature must be left to the independent commission, without the minister pre-empting and having powers to issue any special directions later,\\" Maharaj said. Otherwise, the possibility existed of political interference and discrimination as to just who constituted a victim and qualified for compensation - a situation that had already arisen in other contexts, Maharaj said.  Politicians and chiefs  * Meli Bogileka, General secretary of the People's National Party and a former Cabinet Minister in the Chaudhry government, who was held hostage by the followers of George Speight during the rebellion, called for changes to the bill. While supporting the principle of reconciliation, he considered that compensation for the victims ought to take precedence over any amnesty for the perpetrators. \\"To bring in clauses for amnesty within the framework of the Reconciliation Commission is a bit too much,\\" he said on 15 May. This made the proposed compensation look too much like a payment for the amnesty, and would ignore the physical, psychological, and emotional trauma the victims had suffered. * Militoni Leweniqila, a member of the executive of Rabuka's Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), said on 22 May that the proposal was, in fact, almost identical to one that Rabuka had put forth in 2002 as a way to move forward on the basis of reparations being paid and forgiveness being given. It could start, he said, with an acknowledgement that Mahendra Chaudhry was the rightful Prime Minister of Fiji. Facing up to the wrongs that had been committed would be essential, however. On 30 May, however, he cautioned that the legislation failed to address the core problems that made national unity so elusive, which he said included the grievances of deposed Prime Minister Chaudhry and military commander Bainimarama. \\"The bill is four years too late and it has nothing that will attract these two to sit down and consider what the Government is proposing,\\" Leweniqila said. The government, he said, should genuinely approach Chaudhry and Bainimarama as the offended parties and deal with their cases separately. He also accused the government of committing \\"too many blemishes and blunders,\\" which he attributed to \\"inexperience.\\" * One chief from Ba Province, who spoke to the Fiji Times on condition of anonymity on 29 June, gave qualified support for the bill but said that the amnesty provisions were unacceptable. He and other chiefs present at that Provincial Council meeting that day would support the bill, he said, if the amnesty clauses were excised. They made the bill seem \\"wrongdoers oriented\\", and he did not want to be a party to it. * Ratu Seru Seruvakula, Chairman of the Nasautoka sub-district of the Wainibuka district of Tailevu Province, also gave qualified approval. The people of his district agreed that the bill was good, he said, but were less positive about the amnesty provisions. The villagers believed that anybody breaking the law should face the consequences, Seruvakula said. * Ratu Josaia Duacia, the Chief of Sikituru in Ba Province said on 5 July that a fundamental weakness of the bill lay in its failure to address the multicultural and multireligious character of Fiji. Pointing out that its supporters promoted it as a reflection of Christianity, he questioned how it related to nonbelievers. \\"How can we enforce a so-called Christian law on people that do not worship the Lord? Some of these people worship statues and idols so how do we expect them to follow a Christian Law?\\" he queried. He supported the bill's objectives, but said these would be achievable only if the legislation took into account the opinions of everyone on the country. * The Tui Ba Bulu, Ratu Sairusi Nagagavoka, said on 12 July that he was opposed to the decision by the Ba Provincial Council to endorse the legislation, saying that he preferred a neutral position. He said that the decision to support the bill would only create more division among the indigenous communities of the province. Reports that the chiefs of Ba Province had endorsed the bill unanimously were misleading, he said. Many chiefs had been absent from the Lautoka meeting on 5 July; at the last gathering of all chiefs, on 30 June, the chiefs had been divided over whether to support the bill or not. He accused the Council Chairman, Ratu Ovini Bokini, of having manipulated the council into supporting the legislation. : Bokini responded on 14 July, saying that the council decision had indeed been unanimous. While stating that Ratu Nagagavoka was entitled to his opinion, he said it was a very sensitive issue and he thought it important not to create any \\"misunderstanding\\" by giving the impression of disunity among the chiefs of the province. A \\"thorough and lengthy discussion\\" among members had, he said, culminated in a unanimous decision to support the bill.  International organizations  The Asia Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy, a branch of the World League for Freedom and Democracy, said on 4 November that it hoped the legislation, and any amendments to it, would not undermine freedom, democracy, or the role of the judiciary. The UN-affiliated body, established in the early 1950s to counter communist expansion, had held its 51st conference in Nadi, Fiji, the previous week.

His pieces often include spoken texts, film and other media. He creates installations and composes music for his own and others‚Äô films. Ever since the beginning of his career, he has been performing actively and widely in Hungary and abroad as well. Biography Szemz≈ë was born in Budapest, into a middle-class family, declassed as a result of World War II and socialism. His family originates from former Upper Hungary. His musical training was conducted in accordance with the Kod√°ly method. He attended an elementary school that specialised in music. Originally he studied fine mechanics at high school that he abandoned at the age of 17 to dedicate all of his time to instrumental studies. He completed the Bart√≥k B√©la Conservatory in two years and later studied at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music (1976‚Äì79). He earned a Media Design degree at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design (2014) and pursued a DLA from the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts (2017). In 1973, he founded the Szemz≈ë Quartet (originally a trio)Members of Szemz≈ë Quartet were J√°nos K√°lnai, G√°bor K√∂l≈±s, Ferenc K√∂rmendy, Tibor Szemz≈ë and later Tam√°s T√≥th playing improvised chamber music, which later merged into Group 180. Group 180 was founded in 1979 and was active until 1989. It was started by Szemz≈ë and his fellow students, friends (L√°szl√≥ Melis, Andr√°s So√≥s, L√°szl√≥ G≈ëz).Members of Group 180 included B√©la Farag√≥, P√©ter Forg√°cs, L√°szl√≥ G≈ëz, L√°szl√≥ Hortob√°gyi, Ferenc Kov√°cs, J√°nos K√°lnai, Ferenc K√∂rmendy, Istv√°n M√°rtha, L√°szl√≥ Melis, √âva Posvanecz, Kl√°ra Schnierer, Ferenc Simon, Andr√°s So√≥s, Kinga Sz√©kely, Tibor Szemz≈ë, Gell√©rt Tihanyi, Tam√°s T√≥th, L√°szl√≥ D. V√∂r√∂s Group 180 played a prominent role in the distribution of international contemporary repetitive music in Hungary and disseminated Hungarian contemporary music abroad. The group achieved a remarkable domestic and international career. (During the ten years of its existence, the Group worked with such major figures of the genre as Frederic Rzewski, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Alvin Curran, Phill Niblock, Arnold Dreyblatt, Peter Kotik or L√°szl√≥ Vidovszky.) In addition, Szemz≈ë began his solo career in 1983. Besides his pieces composed for Group 180 in this period, he created Water Wonder, a piece involving live electronics. From 1987 to 2003, London-based Leo Records released his recordings, occasionally in co-operation with Hungary-based Bahia Records. His first solo release was Snapshot from the Island in 1987. His interest in cinematography was inspired by his ever-lasting collaboration with media artist P√©ter Forg√°cs (Group 180's former narrator) and started with the compositions written for Forg√°cs's films.Tam√°s Kor√°nyi, \\"Taking the Part for the Whole: Some Thoughts Inspired by the Film Music of Tibor Szemz√∂\\", translated by David Robert Evans, in Szemz≈ë began to create individual, music-based films in 1985, which is constantly present in his activity.G√°bor Gelencs√©r: Film Island: The Music Pictures of Tibor Szemz≈ë. In: Benjamin Meade (ed.): Experimental Film: The Missing Frame. Avila University Press, Kansas City, 2010, 118‚Äì140. In 1986/87 he founded Fodderbasis, an open music ensemble. The group's projects were partly multimedia events. They produced some publications, in connection with Forg√°cs's films.The members of Fodderbasis included P√©ter Forg√°cs, L√°szl√≥ G≈ëz, L√°szl√≥ Hortob√°gyi, Kinga Sz√©kely, Gell√©rt Tihanyi, Tam√°s T√≥th In 1996, Szemz≈ë launched the Gordian Knot Creative Music Laboratory,The group originally operated as a trio with P√©ter Magyar, Tibor Szemz≈ë and Tam√°s T√≥th as members. Later it transformed and expanded to a larger ensemble with Ildik√≥ Fodor, Mih√°ly Husz√°r, Szabolcs Kereste≈°, L√°szl√≥ K√©ringer, P√©ter Magyar, Tibor Szemz≈ë, T. Bali, Tam√°s T√≥th as members. The group often performed with guest artists. which operated until 2007. His highly successful and award-winning film was made about the life of S√°ndor K≈ër√∂si Csoma, pilgrim, linguist and tibetologist. The film, titled A Guest of Life ‚Äì Alexander Csoma de K≈ër√∂s (1999-2006) is an intermix animation film and 8mm footage. Both the movie and its stage version are starred by actresses Susannah York and Mari T√∂r≈ëcsik. The direct antecedents of the film were the Invisible Story (1996-2000) based on B√©la Hamvas‚Äô prose and The Other Shore (Japan, 1996). Other prominent pieces in Szemz≈ë's oeuvre are Tractatus based on Ludwig Wittgenstein‚Äôs Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1991-1995), the film Free Fall (1996), the Free Fall Oratorio (CD, 1999), and ¬ªK¬´Engravings, a multimedia-series on Franz Kafka, covering the ten-year cycle between 2008 and 2018.

Since the early 80s, according to the typical art practice of the era, Szemz≈ë's musical activity has been open to other arts (especially literature and fine arts, besides cinematography and theatre), often experimented with the boundaries of different art forms. He has taken part in or created numerous performances. He also creates installations. He regularly worked together with the members of the Vajda Lajos Studio of Szentendre, and with J√°nos Szirtes, with whom he was also a member of the New Modern Acrobatics performance group (1987-1991).Members of New Modern Acrobatics included Istv√°n efZ√°mb√≥, L√°szl√≥ feLugossy, Tibor Szemz≈ë, J√°nos Szirtes, L√°szl√≥ \\"Gazember\\" Waszlavik and on some occasions, P√©ter Magyar Szemz≈ë often worked with fine and oboe artist G√°bor Rosk√≥, as well as with fine artist Tam√°s Waliczky in the early 90s. In his creations, verbality, speech sound, multilingualism, and motion picture play an essential role in a close unity.

Fatimah bint Asad died in the year 625/626. It is narrated by Anas bin Malik, that when Muhammad learned that Fatimah had died, he went to her house to sit beside her body and prayed her funeral prayers, he then gave his shirt to be incorporated into her shroud, and personally helped placing her in her grave in the Jannatul Baqee cemetery in Medina. Children She married her paternal cousin, Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Their marriage was notable for being the first between two members of the Banu Hashim.

The University holds its commencement ceremonies every December and May inside the arena. History The arena opened on December 2, 1996, when the 49ers men's basketball team defeated Appalachian State in a non-conference game. It was the fourth primary home court for the 49ers since they joined the NCAA's Division I in 1970; previously the 49ers played at the on-campus Belk Gymnasium, or \\"The Mine Shaft\\" (1970‚Äì76), Bojangles' Coliseum (1976‚Äì88, 1993‚Äì96), and the Charlotte Coliseum (1988‚Äì93). Even after the men's basketball team began playing its home games off campus, the women's basketball and volleyball teams remained at Belk Gym. Halton Arena has undergone several upgrades over the past several years. In 2002 the Miltimore- Wallis Athletics Training and Academics Center was opened providing a new weight room, The Charles Hayward Memorial Practice Court, Video Communications Center, new Media Relations Office and new coaches' offices for men and women's basketball and volleyball. In 2006, a new high-resolution video screen was added to the hanging scoreboard in the center of the arena. In 2008, the arena purchased the LED court-side displays/tables used at the 2008 Final Four from the NCAA and installed them for use at athletic events. The base of the clock tower contains the ticket office and ticket booths. The 2nd floor holds offices for athletics' marketing, game and facilities operations, and media relations departments. The 2nd floor clock tower and tower access hall hold the administration offices for Venue Management. The 3rd floor houses the athletic department administration offices and meeting spaces. The 3rd floor clock tower and tower access hall hold the offices for the athletic foundation. In 2016, a new $900,000 scoreboard was installed at the area, replacing the previous board. Halton Arena was the location for the 2005 Conference USA women's basketball tournament and the 2009 Atlantic 10 women's basketball tournament, as well as the 2007 Atlantic 10 volleyball tournament. Statues The facility features three Richard Hallier athletic statues depicting sports played at the Arena. The pavilion surrounding the clock tower features statues of male and female basketball players and a volleyball player. There are eleven more Hallier sports statues on the UNC Charlotte campus, all of which were donated by Charlotte businessman and philanthropist Irwin Belk.

Most Fijian politicians outside of the government came out against proposed legislation Along with many politicians, the Military and a number of business and professional organizations also came out against the bill. The campaign derived its name from the yellow ribbons promoted by the opposition United Peoples Party and worn by many citizens, as a sign of their opposition to the legislation. A coalition of organizations opposed to the bill announced on 21 July that they had collected more than five thousand signatures throughout the country. Ponipate Ravula of the Citizens Constitutional Forum said that the petition would be presented to the President and other \\"institutions that can sway public opinion.\\"  The Fiji Labour Party  Opposition Leader and former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, whose government was toppled in the putsch, alleged that the Commission would be a cover for pardoning members of the present government who were implicated in the coup. Chaudhry insisted that one set of rules should apply to everyone, regardless of their position in society, and regardless of their motives for having broken the law. Reacting to Prime Minister Qarase's assertion on 20 May that the government did not need to consult anybody about the legislation, Chaudhry said that the Prime Minister's attitude was arrogant and that he could expect little cooperation in return. He further stated that granting amnesty to the perpetrators of the 1987 coups was a mistake, which should not be repeated this time. \\"The trust and confidence we showed then was sadly displaced. This time around, we must take a hard line attitude to those who think they can overthrow a democratically-elected government with impunity. We have to stamp out this coup-culture that has developed in Fiji.\\" He accused the government of failing to pool the people's talents together in an effort to reconstruct their shattered dreams, trust and confidence. On 24 June, Chaudhry called on Prime Minister Qarase to resign, following \\"serious allegations\\" from Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca that the Prime Minister had misled a delegation of church leaders on 2 May about the true contents of the legislation. \\"It is disgraceful that the Prime Minister should deceive Church leaders to get their support for the Bill. He then had the audacity to mislead the nation by claiming that the Bill had the support of Christians,\\" Chaudhry said. Chaudhry issued a warning to the Fijian chiefs on 17 July, saying that the government could not be trusted to mislead them, having already deceived church leaders about the nature and purpose of the bill. He told them to be on their guard, and to listen to their people. Thousands of people in the provinces, chiefly support notwithstanding, had signed the petition against the legislation, he said. Labour Party Deputy Leader Poseci Bune said on 11 July that he would not participate in the consultations on the bill in his Province of Macuata. He said that petition signature tallies showed that a majority of his fellow ethnic Fijians opposed the legislation, and that they were being cynically manipulated by the Provincial Councils and by the government, which had chosen to consult the Provincial Councils ahead of the Great Council of Chiefs. Krishna Datt, a Labour Party parliamentarian and former minister, said that the government was ignoring the feelings of the people worst affected by the coup, and that \\"any move forward would have to be founded on a solid foundation of understanding and a deeply and genuinely felt sense of forgiveness.\\" Instead of trying to impose its will, the government should enter into a dialogue with the Opposition on this matter, he said. Senivalati Naitala, a Labour Party member and a Ra Fiji Cane Growers Councillor, said on 11 July that the bill was a recipe for terrorism and would be a direct threat to politicians and diplomats. He called for the amnesty clause to be struck from the legislation in order to honestly promote reconciliation and unity in Fiji. On 28 July, Chaudhry strongly criticized the Great Council of Chiefs for endorsing the legislation, and said that his party would continue to oppose it. It was for the perpetrators of the coup to ask for forgiveness, he said, not for the government to initiate such a move. \\"It is wrong for others to be asking for forgiveness on behalf of those who had committed the crime because it is not right,\\" he said. On 2 August, Chaudhry suggested that he and his party might be prepared to support the bill if it was substantially rewritten. He insisted that there could be no reconciliation without truth-telling, and that the bill as it was currently written did not require coup perpetrators seeking amnesty to tell all they knew about the coup or who was behind it. \\"Without [the coup perpetrators] divulging the information they have, there can not really be any reconciliation. It will merely be a vehicle for them to escape justice as is the provision in the current Bill,\\" Chaudhry said. Chaudhry also renewed his criticism of the country's fourteen provincial councils and of the Great Council of Chiefs. He said that their decision to endorse the legislation had not done justice to the indigenous people, and that they should be held accountable. In a Parliamentary debate on 5 August, Labour MP Pratap Chand revealed that his party had initially offered to cooperate in the drafting of the bill, but that Prime Minister Qarase had rebuffed their offer, saying that it would be \\"too time consuming.\\" The Opposition had wanted to negotiate the matter during the Tanaloa talks (a series of negotiations between the government and Opposition, held under the auspices of the University of Hawaii throughout 2004), Chand said, but the government had instead come up with its own version. The Opposition wanted a reconciliation bill that was victim-oriented, he said, rather than one that was perpetrator-oriented, and accused the government of violating its own principles. Chaudhry followed Chand's line on 14 August when he confirmed a willingness to negotiate with the Prime Minister, but only through the venue of the Tanaloa talks. He said this in response to recent statements by the Prime Minister that the door was still open for the Leader of the Opposition to participate in the final drafting of the bill. Chaudhry said that if Prime Minister Qarase was serious about negotiation, he should withdraw the bill pending agreement on its clauses. He alleged that the government had had the bill drafted secretly by a law firm in Melbourne, Australia. \\"He (the Prime Minister) should be genuine in his invitation and not play devious games as he did over the multi-party Cabinet issue,\\" Chaudhry said, a reference to the three-year negotiations, punctuated by numerous legal appeals and counter- appeals, over the formation of a multi-party cabinet, negotiations which the Opposition claims the government conducted in bad faith. The Prime Minister responded on 16 August that he was always willing to talk with the Leader of the Opposition, but that all preconditions must be dropped. Chaudhry's demands that the bill be withdrawn until a consensus version could be produced, and that it should be negotiated through the venue of the Tanaloa talks ‚Äì which he wrote off as a \\"failure\\" ‚Äì were unacceptable to him. \\"Now this is not a trade union. We are running a government, and if he wants to come in engage the Government in discussion on this very important issue, he must come in without any pre-conditions,\\" Qarase said. Labour Senator Anand Singh told the Senate on 26 August that the legislation was an attempt to amend the Constitution without following the proper procedures. The bill undermined the human rights provisions of the Constitution, he said, and also violated six international laws. These laws, according to him, were the Bill of Rights, Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Race Discrimination (CERD), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR). On 6 September Chaudhry reiterated his view that there should be no forgiveness for anybody who was involved in the 2000 coup. He said that the Labour Party had been forcibly removed from office twice, and wanted justice. In talks with Commonwealth Secretary General Don McKinnon the next day, Chaudhry called on the Commonwealth of Nations to suspend Fiji from membership if it passed the legislation. \\"We cannot have a Bill that will be an endorsement for terrorism and lawlessness in this country,\\" he said. Labour Party Senator Anand Singh said on 8 September that he had raised the bill at a workshop of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which was holding its annual conference in Nadi. A delegate from Ghana had revealed that a similar bill had been introduced in his country, Singh said, but opposition from a majority of the population had forced its withdrawal. On 30 September, Chaudhry said that the FLP would continue to campaign against the bill, both locally and internationally. Told by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer that Prime Minister Qarase had assured him that the bill would be amended, Chaudhry said that he would wait and see, and would continue to oppose the bill in the meantime. He reiterated this stance on 7 October, rejecting a compromise mooted by Prime Minister Qarase two days earlier, but offering a bargain of his own: if the bill was withdrawn, the FLP would provide the government with the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to amend the constitution and enact a number of land reforms. He repeated his stance yet again on 26 October, saying that a legal challenge to the legislation was in the pipeline.  The United Peoples Party  United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes called the proposal a recipe for disaster which would license any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so. He accused the government of kow-towing to its junior coalition partner, the Conservative Alliance, on which it depends for its parliamentary majority, in order to keep them on board until the next parliamentary election, expected for 2006. In a statement on 16 May, he said that the bill was not about reconciliation or restorative justice, but rather the creation of a \\"legal framework\\" to pardon, at will, anyone convicted of coup-related offence. This would lead, he said, to the law of the jungle prevailing. On 14 June, Beddoes announced the beginning of a Yellow Ribbon Campaign to promote a petition aimed at forcing the bill to be withdrawn, or at least significantly amended. On 17 June, he accused Prime Minister Qarase of lying about widespread public support for the bill, which, Beddoes claimed, most people had not been given the chance to see. The \\"small group of dissenters\\" referred to by the Prime Minister were, according to Beddoes, the minority who knew what the bill contained. He said that asking the Fijian people to support the legislation without making them aware of its contents was \\"a deliberate attempt to mislead the Fijian community.\\" Beddoes was joined on 18 June by Bruce Rounds, the General Secretary of his party, who said that there were major differences not only between Fiji's two principal races, but also within them. This acrimony in the community, he said, was partly to blame for the high rate of emigration, particularly of highly skilled and highly qualified Indo-Fijians. Following a visit to cities and towns on the northern island of Vanua Levu, Beddoes said on 28 June that he had heard many complaints from locals about having been misled by the title of the bill. The copies of the bill that he had distributed were the first that most of them had seen, he said. Ignorant of what the bill really contained, many had wrongly assumed that it was a sincere effort on the part of the government to unify the country. On 27 July, Beddoes strongly criticized the Great Council of Chiefs for its refusal to accept submissions from the Fiji Labour Party and the Fiji Council of Churches. He said that the government and the Methodist Church, whose submission was accepted by the Great Council, both had vested interests in the Unity Bill, and that by being selective in its acceptance of submissions, the Council would not be hearing balanced appraisal of the bill. Beddoes condemned what he saw as the hypocrisy of imprisoning a man for three years for the theft of six buns and F$200 cash, while legislating provisions to free men imprisoned for much more serious crimes including treason, murder, rioting and looting. Beddoes intensified his attack on the chiefs on 2 August, saying that history would judge them for their endorsement of the bill. He was not surprised by the decision, he said, as a vote against the bill would have amounted to a vote of no confidence in the government, but they could have recommended certain amendments. \\"History will judge them once the impact of the Bill is discharged\\", he said. \\"There is no way anyone with a conscience can support the Government's attempt to legitimise and excuse the act of treason as being justified because it was politically motivated.\\"'' Speaking on Radio Sargam on 16 August, Beddoes declared that if the bill was passed without very significant amendments, he would challenge it in the courts.  The National Alliance Party  National Alliance Party founder and former Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Epeli Ganilau said that the notion that politically motivated crimes could be justified was \\"insulting to the intelligence of ordinary people,\\" and that it represented a naive and uncaring attitude toward the hurt suffered by many during the 2000 coup. \\"The intention to bring a closure to investigations and litigation regarding the 2000 coup would be a severe interference of politics into the work of law enforcement in this country,\\" Ganilau said. On 18 May, he added that he saw \\"nothing reconciliatory about the bill,\\" which he believed to be aimed at legalizing the Muanikau Accord, which had been proposed by George Speight in 2000. \\"To use the word reconciliation is a gross violation of the rights of everyone in this nation,\\" he said. On 16 June, Ganilau accused Prime Minister Qarase of contradicting himself, saying that his denial of a general amnesty in the Fiji Times (on 15 June) conflicted with comments that he had made in New Zealand the weak before. This would, he considered, undermine the Prime Minister's credibility. He also said that there was a widespread belief in Fiji that the legislation was designed to provide for the freeing of coup perpetrators, a belief by the Tui Vaturova, Ratu Ilisoni Rokotuibua who said early in June that it would allow members of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit, who had been jailed for mutiny, to be released. Having built up such expectations, Ganilau said, the government had better be prepared for a strong backlash if they were not fulfilled. He criticized Qarase for expecting the people, as ordinary mortals, to do as only God could do by legislating forgiveness and freeing people from the consequences of their actions. On 23 June, Ganilau condemned what he said was the Prime Minister's \\"monumental deception\\" in asking church leaders to support the legislation without honestly explaining its contents to them. He was reacting to revelations from Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca and other church leaders that at a meeting with the Prime Minister on 2 May, they had been told of the reconciliation and compensation provisions of the legislation, but not about its amnesty provisions. \\"It does not say much about the credibility of the Prime Minister for him to be saying publicly that the Christian churches support the bill after these deliberate acts of deception.\\" Ganilau said. He called on churches to join with other religions to put together an alternative blueprint to the government's reconciliation proposals. The National Alliance Party's submission to Parliament on 27 June warned that if the legislation is passed, the first victim could be the government, as the army could use its legitimization of treason as a legal weapon to oust the government. Ganilau reiterated his stand on 3 July that the legislation was motivated not by the goal reconciliation, but by ulterior motives, namely the freeing of lawbreakers. He called on the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to come clean about the government's real reasons for promoting the legislation. The bill could not achieve its purported goal of reconciliation, he added, because it made no provision for offenders and victims to meet and ask forgiveness. He called on the government to remember that the 2000 coup happened because the perpetrators of the early 1987 coups had been granted immunity from prosecution. On 18 July, Ganilau said he did not believe amendments promised by the government were to be taken seriously. He made the dismissive comment after the government said it would amend the legislation to protect the independence of the police and the judiciary. He said the government had a \\"dismal\\" record on keeping its promises, and believed this latest commitment would be no different. \\"As it is, their record of political commitments have been dismal because they had not been genuine in nation building from the beginning and this includes the introduction of this Bill itself,\\" Ganilau said. He also called on the government not to try to deceive the Great Council of Chiefs, which is due to meet to discuss the bill in the third week of July. Reacting to the decision of the chiefs to support the bill on 27 July, Ganilau said that he would have expected the chiefs to have taken more time to consider and debate the matter, but that their decision would make no difference in the end because it was Parliament that would decide on the bill. On 2 August, Ganilau said that Prime Minister Qarase was wrong to defend the decision of the provincial councils to endorse the legislation, saying that they had based their decision solely on information presented by the government, and had not been given the chance to hear alternative views. Ganilau reiterated his opposition to the legislation on 7 October, along with his support of the right of the Military to speak out against government policies that it considered not conducive to national security. He considered that the country could not afford to give amnesty to people who had wronged others. \\"In good times the military will not interfere in politics,\\" he said, but added that the Military had a legitimate interest in opposing the Unity Bill because it could threaten national stability. \\"Maybe it is going to be a cause of instability in future when we continue to provide amnesty for those who have done wrong and our society won‚Äôt tolerate that,\\" Ganilau said. = Meli Waqa = Meli Waqa, Secretary of the National Alliance Party of Fiji, said on 25 May that the amnesty provisions of the bill were \\"repugnant to people's sense of justice.\\" He said that it confused traditional reconciliation practices with legal remedies. \\"While it is acceptable in Fijian custom to reconcile conflicts at a personal level, the rule of law must prevail ‚Äì where reconciliation requires redress and recognition of our existing laws that protect society,\\" Waqa said. He also expressed concern that the legislation would compromise the role of the President. Modelled on the British Monarchy, the role of the President is supposed to be a nonpolitical one, but this would be called into question, Waqa said, by the provisions in the legislation granting the President the final decision on whether to accept or reject all recommendations of the proposed commission. = Filipe Bole = Former Foreign Minister and current National Alliance Party spokesman Filipe Bole said on 31 May that he considered the legislation dangerous. It could, he feared, provide the Military with a legal mechanism to overthrow the government at any time in the future, as it rendered any politically motivated act excusable. \\"The army is already on top of the situation and once the Bill is passed, it will then give the army the legal weapons to oust the Government,\\" Bole said. Addressing the Lau Provincial Council meeting on 25 July, Bole spoke at length about the bill's amnesty clauses, and said that the failure of the bill to mention the word \\"truth\\" was a very significant omission.  The Mara family  The children of the late President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who was deposed during the upheaval, strongly opposed the legislation. * Mara's eldest child, Adi Ateca Ganilau, who is married to Ratu Epeli Ganilau (q.v.) said on 25 June that the Mara family was opposed to the legislation and would not accept any compensation offered them by the proposed commission. She called the bill \\"a forced idea,\\" said that it would set \\"a dangerous precedent,\\" and questioned government's motives for promoting it. \\"If the move to reconcile and compensate came from the coup perpetrators maybe, I would have given it some thought but coming from the Government is hard to accept,\\" Ganilau said. Ganilau said that the government's previous attempt at a national reconciliation, during Fiji Week (4‚Äì11 October 2004 had been a failure, and thought it \\"ridiculous\\" that the government was now trying another scheme to \\"excuse people involved in the coup.\\" This, she said, was \\"not on.\\" She also complained that the government had shown no interest in including the Mara family in the reconciliation process. \\"The hurt is still with us, something we do not openly discuss but this government has not attempted to include us in any of their reconciliation process,\\" Ganilau said. In a statement on 24 July, Ganilau charged that the coup had not occurred spontaneously but had been \\"premeditated, well planned with all the personal graffiti being churned out through government offices and business outlets, ludicrous paraphernalia designed to malign the former President's family and character.\\" She accused some members of the 2000 and present Senate of openly telling the public then that the government would soon be changed. \\"So what was the Fijian cause all about?\\" she asked rhetorically. Following the decision of the Great Council of Chiefs on 27 July to support the bill, Ganilau said on 30 July that she and her family would continue to oppose it, as it amounted to legalizing the overthrow of her father. * Ganilau's younger sister, Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was held as a hostage by the perpetrators of the coup, added her own voice to the opposition to the legislation on 7 May 2005, saying that if her father were alive, he would not approve of interfering with the course of justice, and that unless all perpetrators of the coup were brought to justice, \\"Fiji cannot put to rest the ghosts of the coup.\\" She also suggested that if the government was serious about reconciliation, it should have done something about it while her father was alive. \\"For all I know this has come very late in the day and it's a bit too late,\\" Nailatikau said. Renewing her attack on the legislation on 20 July, Nailatikau accused the government of neglecting \\"urgent and realistic issues\\" like squatters, unemployment, poverty, and road conditions, in order to concentrate on a bill which was biased towards the perpetrators of the coup rather than the victims. \\"This Bill is lenient towards the perpetrators while the victims get nothing,\\" she said. She confirmed that she would attend a meeting of the Lau Provincial Council, set for 25 July. The Council already knew her views, she said, and she would reiterate them in the presence of the Council members if asked to do so. She accused the government of misleading the Fijian people, who had been given to believe that the legislation would strengthen indigenous power, adding that she had personally confronted someone who was distributing leaflets, which she said promoted discrimination against other races. Nailatikau also challenged the government to say why it could not function without the coup perpetrators. Joji Kotobalavu, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's office, reacted by asking, \\"What kind of question is that?\\" Speaking on behalf of the family, Nailatikau again condemned the legislation on 24 July, saying that it was tantamount to supporting the overthrow of their father. Nailatikau said the bill went against everything her father had believed in. \\"I recall what the late Tui Nayau said at his last Lau Provincial Council meeting on Ono, Lau, in October 2000: 'There can be no reconciliation or peace until the coup investigations are completed and the rule of law is upheld'\\", she said. Her father had stood for the rule of law, unity, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence, she said. His policies had \\"brought peace and unity to the different races of Fiji.\\"'' Nailatikau said that some government authorities were \\"hell-bent\\" on pursuing the amnesty clauses of the bill, thereby creating the impression that there was some connection between the coup perpetrators and themselves. She demanded to know what the connection was. In the same statement, Nailatikau spoke highly of Military commander Frank Bainimarama (q.v.), another strident opponent of the legislation. \\"The commander is doing a wonderful job because he is not only speaking in his personal capacity as Commander,\\" she said. \\"He is speaking as the Commander of the Fiji battalion in Fiji and those serving overseas, and he has the support of the silent majority,\\" Nailatikau said. Following a vote of the Lau Provincial Council to endorse the bill on 25 July, Nailatikau was at first too disappointed to speak to the media. She later said that the decision was \\"regretable and unfortunate\\" given the seriousness of the crimes committed in 2000. She said that the release of coup perpetrators could not be condoned by right-thinking and law-abiding citizens. \\"To put it in simple English, you break the law, you commit a crime, you do the time,\\" she said. Nobody was above the law, she maintained, and it was the duty of the government and the people to uphold it. Nailatikau reiterated earlier statements that endorsing the bill amounted to approving the overthrow of her father, and expressed her belief that the Provincial Council members who had voted in favour of the legislation had not understood it ‚Äì an assertion promptly rejected by Prime Minister Qarase, also a Lauan, who claimed that most people were well informed on the bill and supported it because they did understand it and agreed with it.  Other politicians and chiefs  * National Federation Party (NFP) President Dorsami Naidu spoke out against the bill on 14 May, saying that what happened in the 2000 coup was \\"an act of terrorism\\", and that he could not see why persons implicated in it should be considered for amnesty. On 20 May, he called for public demonstrations to oppose the bill, which he said was \\"just a cover for providing amnesty to people who committed the May 2000 coup crime acts.\\" The NFP disagreed with the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) over tactics for opposing the legislation, with its General Secretary Pramod Rae saying on 6 June that the FLP decision to boycott parliamentary committees was \\"a cowardly act\\" that would \\"effectively render the Indo-Fijian community voiceless.\\" It would be better, he said, to work to change the viewpoints of government legislators by scrutinizing public submissions on the bill in the parliamentary committees. * Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei Secretary Ema Druavesi accused the government (18 May) of harbouring ulterior motives in promoting the bill. The real purpose was to retain the loyalty of the Conservative Alliance (CAMV), whose six votes were crucial to maintaining the government's parliamentary majority. Many members of the CAMV were implicated in the coup. * Ratu Aisea Katonivere, the Paramount Chief of Macuata Province, announced on 2 June that he was withdrawing his previous support for the bill after Attorney General Bale clarified that amnesty was, indeed, provided for in the legislation. \\"I do not support its amnesty provisions,\\" Katonivere said. \\"The majority of our sons who were convicted have accepted, suffered and served sentences for their deeds. People should learn to respect the law and abide by it, and face the consequences. Only then will they learn from their mistakes ... To suspend or hinder the process of law by the judiciary will not be championed by me.\\" * Senator James Ah Koy announced his opposition to the legislation on 28 June, in defiance of the Kadavu Provincial Council, labelling it a \\"diabolically conceived bill with its origins in hell.\\" Ah Koy acknowledged that his defiance of the Provincial Council's decision to support the bill might cost him his seat in the Senate, but said that he would not shrink from standing for truth as he saw it. \\"This Bill is anti-Bible and every Christian should vote against it if they are true to the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Israel,\\" he said. He criticized Ratu Nawalowalo and the Provincial Council for supporting the bill without consulting the tribes and villages of the province. He charged that the government's real motive in promoting the bill was to save the skins of some of its members who were being pursued by the police. * Adi Ema Tagicakibau, a Cabinet Minister in the deposed People's Coalition government and now a spokesperson for the Pacific Concerns Resource Centre, said on 31 July the Great Council of Chiefs had missed a great opportunity to show true leadership when it decided on 27 July to endorse the bill. \\"We are naturally disappointed as we had hoped in our submission to make the chiefs see the self-serving interests behind this Bill, that had nothing at all to do with genuine reconciliation for the nation,\\" she said. She said that opponents of the bill needed to continue to educate the public as to its true purpose, and to vote their conscience in the upcoming election, due in 2006.  The Fiji Law Society  On 21 May, Fiji Law Society president Graeme Leung spoke out against the bill, which he said would empower politicians to overturn judicial decisions. Leung said that he and the Law Society supported the idea of reconciliation, tolerance, and unity, but were strongly opposed to pardoning perpetrators of the coup. The amnesty provisions of the legislation were, he said, \\"repugnant\\" and would hamstring the courts. \\"It's likely to demoralise the judiciary and sap it of the will to continue its work.\\" It would also encourage future generations to regard coups as something they could take part in with impunity. While opposing the legislation, however, he cautioned the military to show restraint, saying that Parliament had the constitutional right to pass laws, whether good or bad, and that it was up to the people to punish politicians for bad laws at election time. \\"If the law is bad and unpopular, it is for the people through the ballot box, to show their displeasure. But in a democracy, it is not the business of the military, however well-intentioned, to interfere with the law- making process.\\" In a further hard-hitting letter to Prime Minister Qarase, Leung said on 23 May that the bill was \\"not the answer to Fiji's problems,\\" and would not achieve its purpose of reconciling Fiji's communities. Its provisions for amnesty and compensation of victims, he said, favoured the rich over the poor. He warned the government against assuming the support of a majority of the public. As Fijian culture did not encourage outspokenness, Leung said, it would be a mistake to interpret silence as support. \\"It's the way we are ‚Äì our people show their respect to their leaders by keeping quiet. It is considered rude to speak your mind,\\" he told the Prime Minister. (Attorney General Qoriniasi Bale countered this the next day by saying that equally, the silence of the population should not be interpreted as meaning that they opposed the legislation). In a parliamentary submission on 16 June, Leung called the bill a recipe for instability, terror and payback, and a retrograde step, which could threaten present and future governments. \\"It would encourage the belief that if people think they have sufficiently good political reason to topple a government, politicians might consider granting them a pardon,\\" Leung said. He expressed content that the decisions of the Commission and Amnesty Committee would not be required to state any reasons for their decisions, which would not be subject to appeal. He said it was \\"abhorrent and unacceptable\\" to create what amounted to retrospective legalization of a terrorist act. On 3 July, Leung said that if the bill became law with its amnesty provisions intact, the Law Society would challenge it in the courts. He said that he had tried to schedule an appointment with the Prime Minister to discuss the whole matter, but that more than a week later, he had received no reply. Leung said on 4 July that he was seeing an audience with the Attorney-General to try to persuade him to rewrite the bill after Military Commander Frank Bainimarama called it \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" Calling ethnic cleansing a horrific idea, Leung said that every right thinking person would be alarmed that the debate had risen to that level, and that there was an urgent to hold talks to resolve the standoff. On 2 August, Leung expressed disappointment, but not surprise, that the Great Council of Chiefs had decided on 27 July to support the bill. The Society would continue to look at a legal challenge to it, he said. Leung's latest comments drew a sharp response the next day from Cabinet Minister and Leader of the House Jonetani Kaukimoce, who said that he would have expected the Law Society, as the representative body of the legal profession, to behave in a more appropriate and dignified manner.  Citizens Constitutional Forum  Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum said that \\"the policy behind the bill should be offensive to right-thinking people,\\" because it would be impossible to have reconciliation without including in the decision-making Indo-Fijians, who he said \\"bore the brunt of the coup.\\" He also opposed the possible appointment of former Chief Justice Tuivaga to chair the commission. Tuivaga played a controversial role in recognizing the Interim Military Government that took power during the 2000 coup, and in an extra-constitutional reorganizing of the judiciary, a move that was later reversed. Yabaki was joined by fellow CCF spokesman Jone Dakuvula on 21 June, who accused the government's coalition parties (the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua and the Conservative Alliance) of violating their own election manifestos by sponsoring the legislation, which he said flew in the face of their election promises to uphold the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. In a parliamentary submission on 27 June, Dakuvula declared that the bill, having already become a cause of division and dissent, would not promote reconciliation. The secrecy with which the bill was drafted, and the haste with which it was being pushed through parliament, contradicted the government's assertions that it was an instrument of reconciliation, he considered. He said that the bill gave victims no incentive to forgive, and that it did not require wrongdoers to express remorse or apologise. The bill's compensation provisions, he said, were completely inadequate. Too few would qualify for compensation, and it would be much more limited than what an existing court might award. Forum spokesman Ponipate Ravulo told a public rally on 21 July that the consultation process on Unity Bill was being manipulated by the government to keep the public uninformed, and that \\"grassroots\\" people had not been involved. He said that the country could not afford another coup and therefore the bill should not be passed. Yabaki reiterated his opposition to the bill on 5 February 2006.  Religious opposition  The Roman Catholic Church, several Protestant churches, and numerous Hindu organizations were extremely critical of the bill and called on the government to withdraw it. Archbishop Petero Mataca of the Roman Catholic Church spoke out against the bill on 22 June, reversing earlier support for it ‚Äì support that he claimed had been based on a misleading presentation from the Prime Minister before the legislation was made public. He called the overthrow of a democratically elected government a serious crime, and said that \\"the coup cycle\\" would continue unless those involved faced the consequences of their crimes. The Shree Sanatan Dharm Pratindhi Sabha Fiji and the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha were among the numerous organizations representing Hindu faith, followed by some 76 percent of the Indo-Fijian community, to have strongly condemned the legislation, especially its amnesty provisions. Other religious groups to oppose the legislation include the Salvation Army, the Council of Interfaith Search Fiji, the Jesus Christ Apostolic Church, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and a dissident faction of the Methodist Church (as opposed to the official Methodist stance in support of the bill). Josateki Koroi, a former President of the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma is one of the critical voices.  Women's organizations  * Shamima Ali, coordinator of the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre, called the bill an invasion of human rights and said (14 May) that the government should not bulldoze its way through and impose the legislation without the consent of the people. On 15 July, her deputy, Edwina Kotoisuva, said that rape and other sexual crimes, particularly against Indo-Fijian women, had been widely committed by perpetrators of the coup, and that the amnesty provisions of the proposed law could result in such crimes remaining beyond the reach of justice. * Ravesi Johnson of the women's organization Soqosoqo Vakamarama i Taukei spoke out against the legislation on 26 May. \\"The proposed bill has the objective of granting amnesty to those who were accused of political crime,\\" she said. This would, she considered, threaten the future peace and stability of the country where women wanted their children to be raised. (Johnson's opinion does not appear to reflect the group as a whole, which endorsed the bill on 21 July, according to its Tailevu Provincial representative, Adi Finau Tabakaucoro). * Suliana Siwatibau of a group called Concerned Mothers Group Against the Bill said on 16 June that the widespread opposition to the legislation was motivated not only by its contents, but also because of what she said was the government's unwillingness to proceed with its development in a transparent and consultative process. Opposing amnesty for perpetrators of political crimes, the widow of the academic leader Savenaca Siwatibau called instead for more direct compensation of the victims of such crimes. \\"I do not see why they want to claim for compensation when this could be done through the Ministry of Labour on the workmen's compensation of something like F$20,000,\\" she said. Siwatibau expressed concern that the legislation threatens the independence of the judiciary. She also said she was alarmed that it would have a corrupting effect on the minds and character of the future generation, which would threaten the future stability and prosperity of the nation. Children, she said, should not be exposed to this \\"coup culture.\\" : Reacting to the decision of the Great Council of Chiefs to endorse the bill, Siwatibau said on 29 July that the chiefs were right to invite concerned groups to inform them of their objections, but had not been given enough time to deliberate on the matter. Over four fifths of the Great Council members were delegates of the country's fourteen Provincial Councils, which all endorsed the bill ‚Äì something which came as no surprise to Siwatibau as they had been briefed only by the government and were required to make a decision on the spot, without being given the opportunity to hear alternative viewpoints. At the very least, she said the Provincial Councils should have been given a Fijian translation of the bill. * The Fiji Women's Lawyers Association attacked the legislation on 22 June, saying that it was dangerous and would allow the overthrow of another lawfully elected government. The Association's President, Ulamila Fa-Tuituku, together with lawyers Ana Rokomokoti, Diane Buresova, Marie Chan and Renee Lal recommended in their parliamentary submission that the amnesty clauses be excised from the bill, because they only served the interests of the perpetrators of the coup. The Association also considered that the compensation provisions were insufficient to cover the gross violations of human rights that took place during the coup. There was nothing the government could do to take away the lifetime scars that the victims carried. * The National Council of Women, representing 39 affiliate organizations, declared its opposition to the bill on 20 July, saying that women had not been adequately consulted and that insufficient attention had been paid to the crimes committed against women in the 2000 coup. Spokeswoman Sharon Bhagwan-Rolls expressed concern at the effect the bill would have on social values, as well as on constitutional principles. \\"We are concerned the provisions of amnesty will perpetuate the coup cycle and undermine the important values we share despite by our ethnic and religious diversities,\\" she said. \\"We are concerned the provisions of the Bill duplicate constitutional provisions and serve to undermine the (independent) role of the judiciary, police and Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, as well as the Fiji Human Rights Commission.\\" Baghwan-Rolls proposed a referendum to settle the matter ‚Äì something the government had already rejected.  Other non-government organizations  * Dr Shaista Shameem of the Fiji Human Rights Commission said on 15 May that parts of the bill appeared to conflict with the Constitution. * The Fiji Institute of Accountants released a statement on 27 May, saying that the proposal would \\"offer an escape for offenders from civil and criminal liabilities.\\" The statement also expressed concern that the legislation was \\"sending the wrong message to young people because they will think that crimes committed with political motives can be quashed, especially if a government that supports their view is in power.\\" * Kallu Dhani Ram, General Secretary of the Kisan Sangh, Fiji's oldest farmers' organization, established in 1937, spoke out on 28 May, calling the legislation an \\"abuse of power.\\" He said that while the proposed Commission would be empowered to compensate coup victims for personal assault and loss of property, there was no provision to compensate people for the emotional trauma they had suffered. Moreover, he disagreed with the use of taxpayers' money to compensate victims of the coup. \\"It is most unfair to compensate the victims of wrongs done by the offender from taxpayers money because it amounts to compensating the victim from his own money,\\" he said. : The Kisan Sangh reiterated its opposition to the legislation on 7 July and again on 17 August, with Ram saying on both occasions that the bill would only aggravate tensions between the races, and would be a recipe for further coups in future. Even a wholly indigenous Fijian government would not be safe, he said. * Economist Wadan Narsey said on 31 May that the estimated administrative cost of the proposed Commission would be F$6 million. This figure did not include compensation layouts. He questioned the wisdom of establishing the Commission at all, from the angles of both justice and economics. \\"Criminals could be granted amnesty, protected from civil or criminal charges, and given immunity from claims for fair compensation,\\" he said. This would discourage investors. He also said that pardoning soldiers convicted of mutiny would demoralize the Military and undermine discipline. *Former Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Gregory Allen accused the government of being more concerned about its own electoral survival than about the rule of law. In a press release on 8 June, Allen, now a senior lecturer in Transnational Crime Prevention at Australia's Wollongong University, said that the bill was \\"deceptively\\" labelled and that its true purpose was to pardon convicts and prevent further prosecutions of people involved in the 2000 coup. \\"Through this jurisprudential delusion, of course, the crime of treason simply ceases to exist,\\" he said. * William Parkinson of Communications Fiji Limited, a broadcasting company, said on 15 June that the government had left it too late to consult the public about the legislation. If reconciliation was the purpose of the bill, he said, the public should have a sense of ownership over it. The amnesty provisions would tear the nation apart, he said, rather than foster reconciliation. * Samisoni Kakaivalu, editor of the Fiji Times, said that he supported the reconciliation provisions of the bill, but considered its amnesty provisions \\"destructive to promoting reconciliation.\\" He also expressed concern that the bill had not been translated into Fijian, which meant that some people could not understand its contents. * Dr Biman Prasad, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of the South Pacific, told the annual general meeting of the Fiji Institute of Accountants on 18 June that he considered the legislation to be a scapegoat, a political ploy on the part of the government to distract the public from the serious issues affecting the economy. He said that reconciliation would stand a far better chance of success if a climate of economic prosperity and social justice could be created, to improve the quality of life for the people. * The Concerned Citizens Against the Unity Bill, a coalition bringing together many of the opponents of the legislation, organized a mass rally against the bill in Suva on 21 July. A week before the rally, Senator Felix Anthony, a spokesman for the coalition, accused the government of having misled the population, including the nation's churches, about the true purpose of the bill. \\"We firmly believe the Government is just giving one side of the Bill for the public to know about and that is not good,\\" Anthony said. Coalition member Bernadette Ganilau, who is married to Ratu Rabici Ganilau, the younger brother of the National Alliance Party founder (q.v.), said that the legislation would only lead to hatred and violence rather than tolerance and accommodation. She said that the opponents of the bill had chosen the colour yellow for their campaign because it represented hope, life, and good sense. \\"Car and business owners, villagers and residents are encouraged to tie a yellow ribbon on their car, their boat, around a tree, on their door and anywhere it can be seen,\\" Ganilau declared. She expressed the hope that parliamentarians would vote according to their conscience, rather than along party lines. * Psychotherapist Selina Kuruleca told the parliamentary committee on 21 October that the amnesty clauses could cause severe widespread emotional distress in the future and could lead to \\"the erosion of accepted social norms of behaviour and the normalisation of violence with psychological consequences that can last beyond the Government lifespan.\\" * Maciu Navakasuasua, an explosives expert who served a three-year prison term on Nukulau Island for coup-related offences, spoke out against the legislation on 3 January 2006. Navakasuasua, who had since recanted his role in the coup and generated considerable media publicity with his allegations against high-profile citizens, said that the bill was politically motivated and would incur divine judgement. Speaking to the Fiji Sun, Navakasuasua praised Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama for opposing the legislation, and said that justice must be done. \\"I was one of the coup planners and have served my time in prison,\\" he said.  The police  * Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes expressed reservations about the legislation on 24 May, saying that empowering the proposed commission to override decisions of the judiciary could compromise police investigations. He said that he would inform Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola of his reservations. Hughes had previously stated that a better approach to reconciliation could involve George Speight, the chief instigator of the 2000 coup, testifying to the police and revealing all he knew. He said that Speight had turned down several attempts by the police to persuade him to do so. The disagreement between the government and the police escalated on 7 July, after the police made a submission to Parliament strongly opposing the bill, saying that it would create more division, encourage coups, threaten national peace and security, and undermine the powers vested in the Commissioner of Police by the Fijian Constitution. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola ordered Commissioner Hughes to refrain from making any further public comments. As a government institution, Vosanibola said, the police must express their opinions through the proper channels. \\"The Fiji police believes the primary purpose of the proposed Bill is to grant amnesty to those who committed serious criminal offences during and after the events of May 2000,\\" the parliamentary submission said. \\"Serious criminal offences that were committed during the designated period mentioned in the Bill include murder, serious injuries to people and damage to properties. \\"To allow murderers and those who committed treason to go free is political expediency rather than promoting reconciliation, tolerance and unity in Fiji.\\"  The Military  The Military of Fiji also opposed the bill. Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama called it \\"Reconciliation bull\\" on 13 May 2005, and on 16 May, Army spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that a meeting of senior officers had resolved to try to prevent the passage of the legislation. \\"We are not in favour of the Bill that proposes to offer amnesty for coup perpetrators in 2000, and will do all we can to oppose it,\\" Leweni said. Among other objections, the Military claims that its integrity and discipline would be undermined if soldiers who mutinied in the 2000 upheaval were to be pardoned.

The bridge deck was completed on 7 April 2009, and opened to traffic on 20 December that year. The bridge was the second-longest cable- stayed span in the world at the time of its completion. The approaches at Tsing Yi and Stonecutters Island are located near Container Terminal 9 and Container Terminal 8, respectively. The bridge is part of Hong Kong's Route 8, connecting Sha Tin, Cheung Sha Wan, Tsing Yi island, Ma Wan and Lantau Island. Other major constructions along the route are Nam Wan Tunnel (completed in 2008), Eagle's Nest Tunnel (completed in 2008), Sha Tin Heights Tunnel (completed in 2008), Tsing Ma Bridge (completed in 1997) and Kap Shui Mun Bridge (completed in 1997). The Stonecutters Bridge won the 2010 Supreme Award at the annual Structural Awards presented by the Institution of Structural Engineers, United Kingdom. History Construction commenced on 27 April 2004 by Maeda-Hitachi-Yokogawa-Hsin Chong JV (a joint venture of Maeda Corporation, Hitachi Zosen Corporation, Yokogawa Bridge Corporation, and Hsin Chong). It cost HK$2.76 billion. It was reported to be over budget. Structure The bridge spans , with 3 lanes in each direction. It is a cable-stayed bridge with two bridge towers, one on Tsing Yi Island and the other on Stonecutters Island. With a main span of , Stonecutters Bridge has the third-longest cable- stayed span in the world, after the Sutong Bridge and Bridge to Russky Island. It was built at a cost of HK$2.76 billion. Bridge design The design concept for the bridge was procured by Highways Department in Hong Kong through an international design competition. The winning scheme was the one presented by a group consisting of bridge architect Dissing+Weitling together with engineering firms Halcrow Group, Flint & Neill and Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute. The design was selected as the Reference Scheme for the further design development. A group led by Arup with COWI A/S as main sub-consultant has carried out the further design development of the Reference Scheme and the detailed design that followed. The concept was for a cable- stayed bridge with a twin aerodynamic deck suspended from two 295m-high single pole towers. These towers have bases measuring 24m x 18m tapering to 7m diameter at the top, and the deck allows a navigation clearance of 73.5m over the full entrance to the Container Port. The two towers are in concrete until level +175m and in composite construction consisting of an inner concrete ring with a stainless steel skin for the top 120m. The original concept had a conventional steel structure above level +175m but Arup found that this configuration would be too lively and lead to unacceptable vibrations of the stay cables. Using a heavier composite section instead of a pure steel structure solved this problem. For reasons of durability and to enhance the appearance, further studies concluded that the tower skin should be fabricated from a duplex stainless steel (grade 1.4462 to BSEN10088) with a shot peened surface finish. The deck itself is made of steel in the main span and of concrete in the side spans. The tower foundations are located within 10m of the seawall on either side of the Rambler Channel, close to the back-up land next to CT8 and CT9. Their proximity to the channel necessitated ship impact testing and modelling. Geotechnical centrifuge testing was conducted using a 1:200 scale model of a vessel bow section and seawall within a container. Wind studies The Hong Kong region is susceptible to very strong typhoon winds, a fact that was taken into account in the design of the bridge. In October 2002 a mast was erected at the site to measure the speed, direction and turbulence of winds in the area. Readings, which continued until January 2004, were transmitted in real-time to an offsite location for further analysis. In particular, the stability of the long cantilevers during construction required special consideration in the design. Walk For Millions Prior to its formal commissioning, a Community Chest Walk for Millions was held 15 November 2009 to allow the public to walk along Stonecutters Bridge and East Tsing Yi Viaduct and through Nam Wan Tunnel. Over 30,000 participants took part, raising more than HK$10 million for the charity's Children and Youth Services. In popular media As a result of the interesting challenges and extreme difficulty in constructing this bridge, the project was featured on two of the Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering series on 1 November 2006 and 27 April 2009.

He played from through for the Buffalo Bisons, St. Louis Browns, Chicago Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Senators and New York Giants. He also served as player-manager of the Browns in 1896. Latham stole 129 bases during the 1887 season. His career total of 742 ranks seventh all-time in the majors. As a player-coach for the 1909 Giants, Latham at age 49 became the oldest MLB player to steal a base. After his retirement as a player, he became what is acknowledged as the first full- time base coach in baseball history. For years he served as a coach and manager in minor league baseball. After retiring from baseball, Latham traveled to Great Britain, where he organized baseball matches for soldiers during World War I, and taught baseball to the British. He later worked in baseball as a press box attendant. Early life Latham's father served as a bugler for the Union Army in the American Civil War. Latham became interested in baseball when soldiers returning from the battlefield brought the game of baseball with them. At the age of fourteen, Latham played with a local team from Stoneham, Massachusetts as their catcher. He played in the field barehanded. In 1877, he played for a team in Pittsfield, Massachusetts as the third baseman. Playing career Latham made his professional debut in minor league baseball with Springfield of the National Association in 1879. Latham debuted in MLB with the Buffalo Bisons of the National League (NL) in 1880, becoming the first man from New Hampshire to play in MLB. He played for the Philadelphia Athletics of the National Association in 1881, and the Philadelphia Phillies of the League Alliance in 1882. Latham returned to MLB with the St. Louis Browns of the American Association (AA) in 1883. Latham was known as a very good base stealer in his day. He led the AA in runs scored (152) during the 1886 season. He also batted .316 and stole 142 bases, plus another 12 stolen bases in the playoffs. In , as a member of the Browns, he stole 129 bases. This record is not recognized by Major League Baseball, as stolen bases were defined differently prior to . He led the league in stolen bases with 109 during the 1888 season. In 1890, he jumped to the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League. He returned to the NL with the Cincinnati Reds in July 1890 to serve as a utility player and coach.The Deseret News via Google News Archive Search He played for Cincinnati through 1895, and was traded to the Browns after the 1895 season with Ed McFarland, Morgan Murphy, Tom Parrott and cash for Red Ehret and Heinie Peitz. The Browns released Latham after the 1896 season. Latham returned to minor league baseball. He played for the Columbus Buckeyes/Senators of the Western League and Scranton Miners of the Eastern League in 1896. He played for the Mansfield Haymakers of the Interstate League in 1897. In 1898, he applied to become a NL umpire;Mansfield Daily Shield via Google News Archive Search instead, he played for the New Britain Rangers of the Connecticut State League and Hartford Cooperatives of the Atlantic League in 1898. Latham returned to MLB with the Washington Senators in 1899. He played for the Denver Grizzlies of the Western League in 1902. He played for the New York Giants of the NL in 1909, becoming the oldest man in Major League history to steal a base, at the age of 49, a record that still stands today. Latham ended his career with 742 stolen bases. Latham's baserunning expertise was apparently purely instinctive. He holds the career record for errors at third base, with 822, more than 200 more than the next player on the list. Latham's arm had been injured in a throwing contest with a teammate, which led to Latham making weak or half-hearted attempts to field ground balls. Return to minor league baseball Latham became an umpire in 1903 in the International League.The Pittsburgh Press via Google News Archive Search In 1906, Latham managed the Jacksonville Jays of the Southern League. He also served as an umpire for the league and the South Atlantic League.The Pittsburgh Press via Google News Archive Search Coaching career Latham was major league baseball's first full-time coach. When he was a player, as at that time there were no coaches, he would stand on the third base line and yell insults at the other team's pitcher, attempting to distract him and give the Browns an advantage. One of his techniques was to scream while running up and down the third base line during the pitcher's delivery. The coach's box was introduced to prevent him from doing this. While Cy Seymour coached third base during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Seymour tackled Moose McCormick as he rounded third base and headed for home plate. When Giants' manager John McGraw asked why, Seymour made an excuse about having the sun in his eyes. This led McGraw, now realizing the need for a full-time coach, to hire Latham for the role, the first full-time coach in MLB.Mathewson, p. 121 Latham tried to do the same things in New York as he had done years earlier in St. Louis, but times had changed and screaming obscenities was not looked well upon, as baseball was being changed into more of a family-friendly game by then. In the opinion of Fred Snodgrass he was \\"probably the worst third base coach that ever lived\\". After the 1910 season, Latham was let go by the Giants.The Milwaukee Sentinel via Google News Archive Search In 1914, Latham coached Lynn of the New England League;The Pittsburgh Press via Google News Archive Search in July 1914, he resigned from the team.

History The major limitations in molecular clinical analysis of tissues include the cumbersome nature of procedures, limited availability of diagnostic reagents and limited patient sample size. The technique of tissue microarray was developed to address these issues. Multi-tissue blocks were first introduced by H. Battifora in 1986 with his so-called ‚Äúmultitumor (sausage) tissue block\\" and modified in 1990 with its improvement, \\"the checkerboard tissue block\\" . In 1998, J. Kononen and collaborators developed the current technique, which uses a novel sampling approach to produce tissues of regular size and shape that can be more densely and precisely arrayed. Procedure In the tissue microarray technique, a hollow needle is used to remove tissue cores as small as 0.6 mm in diameter from regions of interest in paraffin-embedded tissues such as clinical biopsies or tumor samples. These tissue cores are then inserted in a recipient paraffin block in a precisely spaced, array pattern. Sections from this block are cut using a microtome, mounted on a microscope slide and then analyzed by any method of standard histological analysis. Each microarray block can be cut into 100 ‚Äì 500 sections, which can be subjected to independent tests. Tests commonly employed in tissue microarray include immunohistochemistry, and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Tissue microarrays are particularly useful in analysis of cancer samples. One variation is a Frozen tissue array.  Use in research  The use of tissue microarrays in combination with immunohistochemistry has been a preferred method to study and validate cancer biomarkers in various defined cancer patient cohorts. The possibility to assemble a large number of representative cancer samples from a defined patient cohort that also has a corresponding clinical database, provides a powerful resource to study how different protein expression patterns correlate with different clinical parameters. Since patient samples are assembled into the same block, sections can be stained with the same protocol to avoid experimental variability and technical artefacts. Clinical cancer patient cohorts and corresponding tissue microarray sets have been used to study diagnostic, prognostic and treatment predictive cancer biomarkers in most forms of cancer, including lung, breast, colorectal and renal cell cancer. Immunohistochemistry combined with tissue microarrays has also been used with success in large scale efforts to create a map of protein expression on a more global scale.

The name specifically comes from the blue ribbons promoted by the ruling United Fiji Party as a sign of support for the bill. This campaign had the strong support of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, Attorney General Qoriniasi Bale, and other members of the ruling coalition and was warmly welcomed by imprisoned coup instigator George Speight. The proposed Commission was intended to have the power (subject to presidential approval) to grant compensation to victims, and amnesty to perpetrators, of the coup d'√©tat which deposed the elected government in May 2000. The following individuals and organizations declared their support for the legislation.  Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase Despite mounting controversy and passionate public pronouncements both for and against the legislation, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase emphatically rejected calls for a national referendum, stating on 23 May 2005 that there is no legislation providing for a referendum to be held. He said that it was the government's prerogative to pass any legislation it wished, and that he did not want to comment further. He referred all questions to Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale, who was out of the country at the time. On 27 May, the Fiji Human Rights Commission agreed to hear a complaint filed by four Opposition parliamentarians ‚Äì Poseci Bune and Daniel Urai of the Fiji Labour Party, Mick Beddoes of the United Peoples Party, and Ofa Swann of the New Labour Unity Party. This decision was criticized on 20 June by Joji Kotobalavu, a spokesman for the Prime Minister, who said that it was inappropriate for the commission to accept complaints about bills before they were tabled and before the public had had a chance to express its views. Speaking in Auckland, New Zealand on 11 June, Prime Minister Qarase said that his government detected strong support for the legislation from \\"important and large sections of opinion\\" ‚Äì but that media coverage failed to reflect that. He said that the legislation would make it easier for people to come forward who might otherwise be unwilling or afraid to talk. \\"Some of those already convicted, may be prepared to make a clean breast of things. Others may decide to keep their secrets and remain in custody, with no amnesty\\", Qarase said. Qarase reiterated on 14 June that there would be no general amnesty; the proposed Commission is intended to look at each case individually, and recommend amnesty only for those found to be deserving. He said there would be no general amnesty and every applicant would have to argue their case individually. He said that applicants would have to persuade the Commission that their motives for involvement in the coup were not criminal. They would also have to make full disclosure of everything they knew. Qarase said that many people were opposed to the legislation because they misunderstood how its amnesty provisions would function. He also implied that they were mean-spirited: \\"They favour the strict application of punishment as retribution or revenge. There is apparently no room in their thinking for amnesty, as an ingredient of restorative justice. The offenders are not deserving of any form of mercy and forgiveness.\\" He said that there was international precedent for the legislation. \\"The sections of the Bill dealing with amnesty were not plucked out of thin air. They have been taken from legislation adopted and successfully used elsewhere. The principles of amnesty are well known and accepted internationally. We have done the research on this\\", he declared. Prime Minister Qarase said on 8 July that he thought the legislation would end investigations into the 2000 coup. Speaking at a meeting in Kubulau in Bua Province, Qarase said that the legislation was necessary to prevent the investigations from dragging on endlessly. \\"I mean, if 10,000 to 20,000 people are going to be investigated, God knows when it will end,\\" he declared. \\"Trial after trial and the list goes on. About 2500 people have been investigated. Those who turned up in Parliament was close to 20,000 people.\\" He added, however, that litigation currently in progress will not be affected, except at the discretion of the courts. Qarase said on 14 July that the debate on the legislation involved many issues of critical importance to the country. He acknowledged that sensitive questions of race and culture were at stake, but insisted that it was important to \\"learn to respect each other's views and to differ without anger or ill will.\\" On 22 July, Qarase announced that if the legislation were passed, there would be an inquiry into the underlying causes of the 2000 coup, as well as the earlier 1987 coups. \\"We need to concentrate more than ever on identifying the reasons for the upheavals of 1987 and 2000 and making sure that such tragedies never happen again,\\" Qarase said at a meeting of the National Advisory Council, a think-tank representing Fiji's ethnic communities, which he chairs. He said there was a fundamental lack of trust between Fiji's two main racial groups, coupled with radically different understandings of the events of 2000. For most indigenous Fijians, he said, the coup was about indigenous rights, whereas for most Indo-Fijians, it was simply a lawless act of terrorism. He did not condone the acts, he said, but believed that it was time to bring closure to the painful aftermath of the coup, which had dragged on long enough. \\"Wounds are reopened when cases go to court and convictions handed down. Racial tensions increased and there was further uncertainty and apprehension,\\" he said. (The Prime Minister's comments were rejected the next day by Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who said that the principal reason behind the coups of both 1987 and 2000 was greed, and that it was a \\"lie\\" to say that they were carried out in the name of indigenous interests). At an address to the Lautoka Chamber of Commerce on 23 July, Qarase spoke at length about the bill. He said there was \\"no question\\" of withdrawing it, as to do so would be a \\"denial\\" of democracy. He denied that the fundamental purpose of the bill was to pardon all who were imprisoned on coup charges. \\"There is no free pass to amnesty for anyone,\\" he insisted. He also said that while he recognized that expatriate businessmen working in Fiji had a right to comment on issues that were directly related to their commercial and professional undertakings, they \\"should exercise care and discretion to avoid crossing the line into active politics.\\" His admonition reinforced a warning to the Fiji Employers Federation from the Ministry of Home Affairs that foreign workers and businessmen who spoke against the government would risk forfeiting their permits. Conference participants were not allowed to question the Prime Minister about the parts of his speech related to the Unity Bill. On 26 July, Qarase reacted angrily to remarks by Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who accused him of manipulating the country's Provincial Councils and using them as rubber stamps to gather support for the legislation, and that it was presumptuous for the councils to speak on behalf of all people in their respective provinces. Qarase said that indigenous Fijians were capable of making up their own minds. \\"It is an insult for him to think Fijians cannot think and make decisions on their own,\\" he said. Chaudhry should learn not to brush aside the remarks of Fijians, the Prime Minister said. He also rejected claims by Lauan Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, the daughter of former Prime Minister, President, and Paramount Chief of Lau that most Provincial Council members who endorsed the bill had not understood it properly. Qarase said that on the contrary, most people were well informed about the legislation, and supported it because they did understand it and agreed with it. The Prime Minister reiterated on 27 July that there would be no referendum. He claimed that he personally favoured one, but said the Constitution did not allow for it. \\"It's a pity, a serious oversight but I personally am in favour of carrying out a referendum,\\" he said. Qarase said it would not be possible to investigate and charge all the individuals, estimated at over 30,000, who had converged at the parliamentary complex during the crisis of May 2000. He considered reconciliation to be the only way forward. He admitted, however, that the bill would be no guarantee against future coups. It would, however, create an atmosphere conducive to reconciliation, tolerance, and unity, he considered. \\"However, with a resounding yes I say we can reconcile and that it really is a matter of the heart,\\" he said. Qarase also said that the government was fine-tuning the bill to ensure its compliance with the Constitution. On 28 July, Qarase hailed the decision of the powerful Great Council of Chiefs and the Methodist Church to endorse the legislation. \\"The decision was made in the best interest of the country and a significant milestone in the process of consultation,\\" he said. Earlier, in an address to the Great Council, Qarase had reiterated a previous assertion that to withdraw the bill would be a denial of democracy. The government would not withdraw it, he said, but would adjust the details of it to accommodate the views of all sections of the community. He also said that a National Council of Reconciliation and Unity would soon be established, which would explore ways to foster reconciliation and cooperation among Fiji's diverse ethnic groups. Faced with continuing opposition to the bill, Qarase pleaded with opponents such as Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry and United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes to give the bill a chance, saying they had \\"a rare opportunity to help bridge the obvious gulf between our people.\\" Speaking on Fiji TV on 30 July, he insisted that the bill was not about the Fijian people as an ethnic group, but about the country as a whole. \\"I think the overwhelming Fijian support for the Bill is saying we are offering a hand of reconciliation, a hand of forgiveness, a hand of friendship, a hand of repentance and unity. I were in Chaudhry's shoes I would grab the opportunity to try and establish dialogue through this Bill with the Fijian people to promote reconciliation and unity and I will do the same with Mr Beddoes as well,\\" Qarase said. In a statement on 4 August, the Prime Minister insisted that the bill was not just for the benefit of indigenous Fijians, but for all the country's citizens. It was his personal push for national reconciliation, he said, and it would be up to members of the public as to how to respond. On 16 August, Prime Minister Qarase rebuffed an offer to negotiate the legislation, provided that it was withdrawn pending the reaching of a consensus and that it be referred to the Tanaloa talks, a University of Hawaii-mediated forum for government-opposition negotiations that took place during 2004. The Tanaloa talks had been a failure, Qarase said, and it was unacceptable for the opposition to set preconditions for negotiations. \\"I welcome his willingness to discuss the Reconciliation and Unity Bill with the Government but he has put forward two ... quite impossible pre-conditions. One of those conditions is that the Reconciliation Bill must be referred to the Talanoa Dialogue and secondly we must withdraw the bill even before we discuss it. He wants to start afresh. Now this is not a trade union. We are running a government, and if he wants to come in engage the Government in discussion on this very important issue, he must come in without any pre-conditions\\", the Prime Minister declared.  Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale On 16 June, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale declared that the fate of the government was linked to the passage of the bill. \\"If the Bill goes down, the Government goes down with it,\\" Bale told a public meeting in Suva. At the same meeting, however, Jale Baba, National Director of the ruling United Fiji Party, denied that the legislation was being pushed for electoral reasons, saying that politically speaking, it was not advantageous to the government which was, he claimed, promoting it on principle, not for political gain. On 29 June, Attorney-General Bale conceded that adjustments to the bill were possible, but criticism would be considered only if it was constructive. He was responding to concerns raised by Ratu Isaia Gonewai, Deputy Chairman of the Nadroga-Navosa Provincial Council, about the impact of criticism from foreign organizations and governments. Bale responded that while he was open to discussion about altering some of the details, the government would not be influenced by foreign intervention, and that if local and international opponents continued to lobby against the bill without making any constructive suggestions on how to improve it, parliament would probably pass it intact. Bale claimed that the bill was essential for reconciliation between Fiji's two main ethnic groups. \\"The Bill is important to overcome the differences in the country before it reaches the extreme of major bloodshed as experienced in other countries. We want to get rid of the huge distrust and racial hatred that is being harboured by some members of the country's two major races as a result of the May 2000 coup,\\" he said. On 21 July, Bale claimed that the bill had been in the pipeline for a long time. The aftermath of the 2000 crisis was negatively affecting the fabric of society, he said, and the government had long wanted to address that, but had delayed doing so until now because it could be misinterpreted as an attempt to cover up the actions of wrongdoers. But five years later, there was still no end in sight, and \\"the government felt it was time to do something about it proactively,\\" he said. He did not expect everybody to be happy with the government's moves. \\"There will always be division in the views of our people, whether we are doing right or adequately.\\" Reacting to statements from Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama that whatever amendments might be forthcoming, the Military was still opposed to the legislation, Bale declared on 26 October that the Military was entitled to its opinion, but it was not the government. The government and not the Military, he said, was the final arbiter on the bill. He denied claims that the bill was unconstitutional, saying that proposed amendments were to take account of public opinion, not to correct noncompliance with the Constitution. Bale also said that the government would not require additional funding to set up the envisaged Commission.  Other politicians and chiefs  * Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka took a measured position in relation to the government's proposed commission. On 19 May 2005, Rabuka said that the objective of the commission should not merely be to grant amnesty and compensation, but to uncover the truth about who was involved in the coup, directly or indirectly. \\"It should be able to get to all those who were behind the coup and not only us who were widely accused of taking part. It should be able to reveal those who planned it, financed it and executed it,\\" Rabuka said. The prospect of amnesty, he said, might encourage some individuals to come forward who might otherwise be unwilling to talk. * Joe Vala Cakau, a former publicity director for the Fijian Political Party, said the bill, which would promote unity among all of Fiji's communities, was long overdue. In a statement on 23 May, he said persons on trial or in prison for coup-related offenses were also victims in their own way. \\"I am sure that most people would like to get on with their lives and forget about the past,\\" Cakau said. * Ratu Amenatave Rabona Ravoka, a senior chief from Bua Province, said on 28 May that \\"every right thinking person should support the bill.\\" He said that forgiveness was an important part of Fijian culture. He supported the compensation provisions of the legislation also. \\"A lot of people may have lost more than what the compensation can cover,\\" he said, \\"but at least the Government was able to recognise their hurt and loss.\\" * Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party General Secretary Iliesa Duvuloco said on 10 June that his party strongly supported the bill, and announced plans for a march through the streets of Suva. Leaders of the Nationalist Party have been imprisoned for coup-related offences. He was joined on 8 July by Soane Nakuna and Soane Tobewaqiri, both unsuccessful candidates for the party in the parliamentary election of 2001. People opposed to the bill did not know the true meaning of reconciliation, they said. \\"These people should go and read the Gospel according to Matthew from chapters five to seven if they want know the true and correct interpretation of reconciliation,\\" Tobewaqiri said. He said the Fiji Law Society, which strongly opposed the bill, was a stumbling block to reconciliation. He also said that chiefs involved in the 2000 coup may have had the best of intentions, saying that they had a right to leadership. * Ratu Aca Soqosoqo, a Kadavu chief, said in a parliamentary submission on 15 June that despite his initial reservations, he supported the bill. He had prayed over it, he said, and was convinced that it was \\"from God,\\" and that all Christians should support it. \\"If you're a Christian support this Bill,\\" he said. \\"It is from God.\\" * Senator Adi Litia Cakobau (one of nine Senators nominated by the Prime Minister) announced a campaign on 19 June to educate the people on the bill. The Fiji Institute for Research and Education (FIRE), which she leads, would embark on a leaflet campaign. The leaflets, titled Na Dodonu ni Taukei (\\"The Rights of Indigenous Fijians\\") would promote the bill as safeguarding the rights of the Fijian people as owners of the land, she said. She complained that laws dating from colonial times made it difficult for ethnic Fijians to protect their landowning rights, a situation she said contravened Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Besides Cakobau, FIRE includes Senator Asesela Ravulu, who is also a Professor at the University of the South Pacific, and Mere Samisoni, a businesswoman. * The Vugalei Landowners Association, which includes members from the districts of Bau, Vugalei, Tai Vugalei, Naitasiri, Viria and Nausori, gave guarded approval to the legislation on 28 June. Vugalei chief Ratu Netava Tagi said that despite reservations about some of the amnesty provisions, the association supported the legislation in principle. He said that those responsible for the upheaval of 2000 should face the brunt of the law, but that those who had followed them should not be punished. \\"We believe that those who had followed those inside the Parliamentary complex should not be punished because they were just followers who knew nothing about the law,\\" Tagi said. * Jale Baba presented the parliamentary submission of the ruling United Fiji Party (SDL), of which he is the Director, on 30 June. He said that amnesty was constitutional and should be an integral part of the justice system. This bill would, he said, \\"allow the people of Fiji to hear and come to terms with the truth of the events that led to and followed the May 2000 crisis.\\" He said it was not true that the bill's purpose was to keep the coalition government intact, and accused the opposition Fiji Labour Party, which opposes the bill, of having done the same thing when it tried to broker a coalition deal with the Conservative Alliance (a nationalist party, a number of whose prominent members have been convicted of coup-related offences). Baba denied that the amnesty provisions of the 1990 and 1997 Constitutions had contributed to the 2000 coup, and doubted that harsher penalties would have deterred it, saying that there were countries which executed coup-plotters but still had coups. : While supporting the legislation, Baba denied on 26 October that it was reflective of SDL policy. It was a government initiative, he said, not a party one, and would not affect their support base. * Former Parliamentarian Timoci Silatolu, currently serving a life-sentence for his role in the coup, said at a court appearance on 8 July that he was in favour of the bill, and was seeking permission from prison authorities to deliver a submission to Parliament's Justice, Law and Order committee, which is looking into the legislation. \\"I believe the Bill is within the ambits of the Constitution and I fully support it,\\" Silatolu said. * Senator Apisai Tora harshly criticized the Military on 23 August for opposing the legislation. He said that the Military was playing politics and not following democratic procedure, and he took a dim view of military teams visiting villages to campaign against the bill.  Provincial Councils  * The Ba Provincial Council declared its support for the bill on 5 July, following a vote of 23-2 by the chiefs of the province, the nation's largest. This vote followed clarifications from Attorney-General Bale, following reservations expressed by certain Council members on 28 June. * The Bua Provincial Council announced on 11 July that its chiefs and members had voted unanimously to support the bill, following a special visit from Prime Minister Qarase and a team from the Attorney- General's office, which explained the legislation in detail. Council Chairman Ratu Filimoni Ralogaivau told the Prime Minister that the council fully supported the bill. * The Cakaudrove Provincial Council endorsed the bill at a special meeting in Yaroi Village in Savusavu on 14 July. The Council Chairman, former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, declared a personal interest in the matter, as one under investigation for his alleged involvement in the 2000 coup, and declined to chair the meeting, handing over to his deputy, Ratu Sairusi Daugunu. * The Council of Rotuma declared its support for the bill on 1 July. Council Chairman Injimo Managreve said that forgiveness was a part of the island's culture. Managreve said the seven traditional chiefs from the island had all endorsed the bill, and the seven elected members of the council had followed suit. \\"We are being looked after by the Government and the GCC of Fiji and if anything happens to them we will also go down with them. That is why we are standing behind them and supporting them with their new Bill,\\" he said. * Kadavu Provincial Council Chairman Ratu Josateki Nawalowalo said on 23 June that he supported the bill. He said it was time for Fijians to focus on positives, not negatives, and called on opponents of the legislation to get behind the government and support its initiatives to take the country forward. He also invited Attorney-General Bale to address the council to explain the provisions of the legislation more fully, after which the Provincial Council unanimously endorsed it. On 27 June, he pleaded with military and other opponents of the legislation to give it a chance, as the chiefs, \\"in their wisdom,\\" had endorsed it. He expressed hope that common sense would prevail. : Meanwhile, Sitiveni Qio, the youth coordinator of the Kadavu Provincial Council, said that teams of soldiers that were travelling throughout the country to explain the Military's opposition to the legislation to rural Fijians, would not be welcome in Kadavu. * The Macuata Provincial Council announced on 13 July that it was supporting the bill, following a meeting with Prime Minister Qarase. * The Naitasiri Provincial Council declared its support on 1 July. Council chairman Ratu Solomoni Boserau said that the forgiveness was the only way for the country to move forward. \\"We need to forgive those who have hurt us and get on with life. We cannot continue to live together with hurt because it only leads to division. The Bill will bring us together and that is why we are supporting it,\\" Boserau said. * The Ra Provincial Council endorsed the bill on 8 July, saying that it could ease some of the pain, misery, and suffering experienced in 2000. Chairman Simione Naikarua said that some members of the council had opposed it on the basis of a \\"misconception\\" about what the bill contained, and he thanked a visiting government team for having given a presentation in the Fijian language. They had been assured, he said, that the bill \\"would not impinge on the integrity and independence and will not interfere in the work of the judiciary, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police.\\" * The Rewa Provincial Council came out in favour of the bill on 15 July. Council Chairperson Ro Teimumu Kepa, who is also a Cabinet Minister in the Qarase government, described the legislation as \\"a way of bringing the country back to stability.\\" She said that all nine districts of the province had endorsed the bill after its amnesty provisions, which had concerned many of them, had been explained by a team led by Attorney-General Bale. * The Serua Provincial Council voted to support the legislation on 5 July. Council Chairman Atunaisa Lacabuka said that the bill would promote unity among Fiji's diverse races and would provide a way forward for reconciliation. The council also tied its support for the legislation to native Fijian land rights and cultural values, which Lacabuka said were based on Christian principles. These principles should be taught, he considered, to non-Christians - a reference to the 94 percent of Indo-Fijians who are either Hindu or Muslims. * The Tailevu Provincial Council declared its support for the bill on 6 July. Council Chairman Josefa Serulagilagi said that they were satisfied with an in-depth explanation from Attorney-General Bale, and took it as \\"a good and healthy sign that democracy is alive and well.\\" * At a meeting from which the media were barred, the Lau Provincial Council voted on 25 July to endorse the bill. It was the last of Fiji's fourteen Provinces to vote on the matter, and the vote of support followed similar verdicts from the other thirteen Provincial Councils. The vote was seen as significant, however, as the Lau Islands are the homeland of Prime Minister Qarase and Attorney-General Bale, the chief promoters of the bill, and of the late Prime Minister, President, and Paramount Chief of Lau, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, whose family is bitterly opposed to it. Nine of the Province's thirteen districts voted in favour of the legislation, with two opposed. One district abstained, and one did not send any representatives to the meeting. Radio Legend News reported that the two districts opposed to the bill were Lomaloma and Lakeba, Mara's home area. His daughter, Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, was too disappointed to speak to the media following the vote, but later said that the Council members had not adequately understood the ramifications of the bill and how it would undermine the judiciary. * The Provincial Councils of Lomaiviti, Namosi, and Nadroga-Navosa have also endorsed the bill.  The Great Council of Chiefs  The Great Council of Chiefs endorsed the bill at a meeting on 27 July. The endorsement came after more than two months of reserving judgement in the light of vociferous public objections. On 18 May, Ratu Ovini Bokini, Chairman said that the Great Council had not been consulted and was \\"in the dark\\" about the bill. He said that attempts to obtain a copy of the bill from the government had come to nothing. The government had not released its draft bill, but a copy was leaked to the media and was published by the Fiji Times. Ratu Bokini's comments drew an immediate response from Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who said that he saw no need for prior consultation with anybody. \\"Any Bill is drafted without consulting any party or stakeholders is because it contains what the Government wants to be included in the Bill,\\" Qarase said. The Great Council of Chiefs had the power to pass or block the bill by instructing its 14 Senators in the 32 Member Senate on how to vote. As they hold the balance of power between the 9 Senators appointed by the Prime Minister and the 8 appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, a block vote by the chiefly Senators would decide the outcome. On 19 July, however, Great Council secretary Asesela Sadole said that their Senators would not be instructed on how to vote, but would be left free to follow their consciences. In a speech to mark Ratu Sukuna Day on 30 May, in honour of Fiji's first modern statesman, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, Bokini cautioned against a one-sided approach to reconciliation, saying that it was not something that could be forced. \\"It must be allowed to grow through a shared understanding of what we all want and where we are all heading,\\" he said. \\"Only then can we negotiate seriously about what to give and what to take and this process takes time and patience,\\" he said. Great Council secretary Sadole announced on 17 July that the council had translated the bill into Fijian for the perusal of its members, pending a meeting to be held in the third week of July. Sadole said that the council would consider the bill on its own merits, without reference to what outsiders have been saying for or against it. \\"Most people have not actually sat down to read the Bill. It seem that most of their opinions is formed by other opinions. We do not want outside consultations to influence the meeting and by taking out our own translation, it can really help,\\" Sadole said. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry warned the chiefs against possible deception by the government. He said that the government had already misled church leaders about the bill, and could not be trusted not to similarly mislead the chiefs. National Alliance Party President Ratu Epeli Ganilau similarly called on the government not to try to \\"fool\\" the Great Council of Chiefs. A Great Council of Chiefs meeting to consider the bill, starting on 26 July, is now considered likely to approve it, as 45 of its 55 members are delegates from Fiji's fourteen Provinces and one Dependency (Rotuma), all of which have endorsed the legislation. The Fiji Military Forces and the Methodist Church are to make submissions at the meeting, but the secretariat of the Great Council had refused a request from the opposition Labour Party (FLP) to make one, ostensibly because of time constraints and on the ground that if they accepted a submission from the FLP, they would have to accept one from every political party. The Great Council qualified its endorsement of the bill by urging the government to consider the concerns raised by its opponents, including the Military. The council supported the maintenance of law and order, but upheld the prerogative of the government to make whatever laws it considered fit, adding that there are legal channels that opponents may use to challenge such laws. They also affirmed that the nation's chiefs represent the entire population, not only indigenous Fijians. Prime Minister Qarase hailed the decision, saying that he had received the \\"overwhelming support of the Fijian people,\\" but Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that the chiefs had failed to address the issue properly, and that he would continue to fight the bill. Another opponent of the bill and former Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Epeli Ganilau said that he would have expected the chiefs to have taken more time to consider and debate the matter, but that their decision would make no difference in the end because it was Parliament that would decide on the bill. Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama, one of the most unyielding opponents of the legislation who had attacked it in an address to the Great Council lasting more than an hour, issued a statement on 29 July strongly critical of the decision. Bainimarama said that the Military accepted the decision of the Great Council to endorse the legislation, but said that the Military would continue to oppose it. Great Council Chairman Bokini said on 30 July that the chiefs had endorsed the legislation on the basis of a number of reasons that the Military should consider. They had supported the bill on the basis of truth and justice, and of the Christian beliefs upheld by the great majority of their members. It was the norm in Fijian culture to resolve differences through dialogue and consensus, he maintained. He hoped that the Military would take these considerations into account.  Religious organizations  The Methodist Church announced its support for the bill on 19 July, according to the Rev. Timoci Nawaciono, head of the church's Nasea circuit. The church reaffirmed this stance at its annual conference on 11 October, and on 19 October, the church's general secretary, Rev. Ame Tugaue, said that \\"all Christians\\" supported the bill. Methodist support was much coveted by the government, as almost two-thirds of indigenous Fijians are affiliated to the denomination. * Kelepi Lesi, Vice-President of the Catholic League, endorsed the bill in a parliamentary submission on 30 June. His stand was in contrast to that of Archbishop Petero Mataca, who opposed the legislation.  Other public figures and organizations  * Former Chief Justice Sir Timoci Tuivaga spoke cautiously, but said that it could work provided that the various parties involved were willing to make it work. * Jaiwant Krishna of the Labasa Chamber of Commerce expressed qualified support for the bill. The reconciliation provisions were good, he said, on 13 May. He cautioned, however, that it would work only if implemented in an honest and democratic way. * Representatives from Lomaiviti Province endorsed the bill on 5 July. Filimone Balaimua, the Roko Tui Lomaiviti (executive head of the Lomaiviti Provincial Council) said that it would lead to reconciliation among all of Fiji's ethnic communities. He added that the council had reservations about some of the amnesty provisions, and would be recommending certain amendments in their submission to Parliament. * Lawyer Kitione Vuataki said on 10 July that if the Fiji Law Society went ahead with its threatened judicial challenge to the amnesty clauses in the legislation, lawyers who supported the bill might split from the society to form a separate organization. \\"The Law Society itself will haemorrhage because there are lawyers like me who support the Bill and we have our freedom of association and freedom of speech,\\" Vuataki said. He warned that if the Law Society challenged the bill in the courts, he would likewise consider challenging the Legal Practitioner's Act and the 1997 Constitution. He said that if the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill should be put to a referendum, as the Law Society insists, the same should be required of the Constitution and the Legal Practitioner's Act. : Vuataki said he did not believe in unconditional amnesty, but believed that the proposed law would stanch the \\"hemorrhaging\\" of society. \\"I totally oppose that type of amnesty as was provided for Rabuka's group in the 1990 and 1997 Constitution. However, I favoured amnesty in exchange for hard data to pull the thorn out of a people who are suffering in pain,\\" he said. He likened the bill to a doctor's stethoscope to check a nation whose institutions including the chiefs of the land, the army, police, civil service, judiciary, and the legal profession. were hemorrhaging. \\"One does not wait for the final heart attack for the nation to collapse,\\" he said. : Vuataki added on 13 July that he had not received any of the five emails that Law Society President Graeme Leung said were sent out to members concerning the legislation, and said that a couple of lawyers who supported the bill were prepared to take the society to court over the issue. * The women's organization Soqosoqo Vakamarama i Taukei endorsed the bill on 21 July, according to Adi Finau Tabakaucoro, a representative from Tailevu. Speaking in the Suva suburb of Nabua, Tabakaucoro disassociated herself from the anti-bill stand of the National Council of Women (q.v.), and said that the decision of the Soqosoqo Vakamarama to support the bill had been unanimous, a claim that appeared to contradict earlier statements opposing the bill by spokeswoman Ravesi Johnson on 26 May, as well as the presence at the meeting of Adi Koila Nailatikau, an avowed opponent of the legislation. Category:Politics of Fiji Category:Ribbon symbolism ","title":"Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji)"},{"id":"2140849","text":"Stanley Edgar Hyman (June 11, 1919 ‚Äì July 29, 1970) was an American literary critic who wrote primarily about critical methods: the distinct strategies critics use in approaching literary texts. He was the husband of writer Shirley Jackson. Life Hyman was born in Brooklyn, the son of Moe Hyman, and raised as an Orthodox Jew. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1940, where he met Shirley Jackson. After reading one of Jackson's stories, Hyman declared that he was going to marry the author. They had four children together. He was a staff writer for The New Yorker for much of his life, and although he did not possess a graduate degree, taught at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont. From 1961 to 1965, Hyman was the literary critic of The New Leader. He did not believe in monogamy and had numerous affairs during their marriage, often with his students. According to Shirley Jackson's biographers, her marriage was plagued by Hyman's infidelities, notably with his former students, and she reluctantly agreed to his proposition of maintaining an open relationship. Hyman was a consistent supporter of his wife's work and resented the lack of recognition she received during her lifetime. He wrote, \\"I think that the future will find her powerful visions of suffering and inhumanity increasingly significant and meaningful, and that Shirley Jackson's work is among that small body of literature produced in our time that seems apt to survive.\\" Hyman also controlled their finances (meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit), despite the fact that after the success of \\"The Lottery\\" and later work she earned far more than he did. A year after Jackson's death in 1965, Hyman married Phoebe Pettingell, who had been a classmate of his daughter, Joanne, and his student at Bennington College. Three months after Hyman's death from a suspected heart attack on July 29, 1970, she gave birth to his last child, a son named Malcolm (1970‚Äì2009), who became a research fellow in the Department of Classics at Harvard University and later at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. Although more likely to be remembered today as the husband of Jackson (he edited a posthumous collection of her work), Hyman was influential in the development of literary theory during the 1940s and 1950s. Equally skeptical of every major critical methodology of his time, he worked out an early instance of a critical theory, exploring ways that critics can be foiled by their own methods. \\"Each critic,\\" Hyman wrote in The Armed Vision, \\"tends to have a master metaphor or series of metaphors in terms of which he sees the critical function ... this metaphor then shapes, informs, and sometimes limits his work.\\" Hyman saw it as his own critical task to point out these overriding themes by which, tacitly, other critics organized their work and their thinking. Hyman was also a noted jazz critic, who wrote hundreds of essays on the subject in addition to his career as a writer and teacher. He had an important influence on Ralph Ellison's career, but they had many disagreements. Books * The Armed Vision: A Study in the Methods of Modern Literary Criticism.

Founded in 1946, business tycoon Lucio Tan acquired the university in 1990. UE was once labeled as the \\"largest university in Asia\\" when its enrollment in the past reached over 65,000 students. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted UE autonomous status, which has only been given to selected higher educational institutions with excellent quality education. Most of the programs offered by the university were accredited by CHED as Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development. UE offers degree programs in commerce and business administration, law, dentistry, engineering, arts and sciences, fine arts, education, computer technology, nursing, physical therapy, medicine, hospitality management and graduate studies. UE has two other campuses, one in Caloocan, and its medical school, the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center located in Aurora Blvd., Dona Imelda, Quezon City. History UE Manila facade along Recto Avenue Panfilo O. Domingo Center for IT Hall, Manila UE Caloocan Campus Dr. Lucio C. Tan Building, UE Caloocan UERM Medical Center The history of the University of the East starts in September 1946, in a rented room on Dasmari√±as St., Manila, where 110 students enrolled in Certified Public Accountant (CPA) review classes. The group of business teachers led by Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan, Sr. that started the sessions made it their objective to help the country, which was still reeling from the war. Of the 110 students, four made it to top spots in the 1947 CPA board Examinations. On September 11, 1946, five people‚Äînamely Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan Sr., Dr. Hermengildo B. Reyes, Jos√© L. Torres, Enid Mapa and Santiago de la Cruz‚Äîestablished the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration (PCCBA) along R. Papa St. in Sampaloc, Manila. The PCCBA admitted 350 students in the summer of 1947. The following year, more students enrolled and more academic units were organized, and the PCCBA moved to what is now UE's main campus on 2219 Claro M. Recto Avenue. PCCBA alumni performed successfully in the government's accountancy examinations. Because of this success, the government granted the PCCBA permission to establish other colleges, leading to the establishment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, and the Graduate School of Business Administration. The PCCBA was granted university status on July 4, 1951, and was renamed the University of the East. Dalupan became UE's first president and chairman of its Board of Trustees. The first members of the Board were Dr. Hermenegildo Balbino Reyes, a businessman, scholar, and former Vice President of the University of the Philippines; Santiago F. de la Cruz, a CPA and business executive who later succeeded Dalupan as UE president; Jos√© L. Torres, a soldier, businessman, and accountant; and Jaime Hern√°ndez, former Secretary of Finance. The succeeding years saw the opening of the colleges of Law, Medicine, and Engineering, as well as the Graduate School of Education. The Graduate School later merged with the Graduate School of Business Administration. In June 1954, UE opened a new campus, then known as UE Tech, on a 4.86-hectare lot along Samson Road in Caloocan. UE Caloocan, which is now academically autonomous, is headed by a chancellor. The new Tan Yan Kee Academic Building houses the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, and Fine Arts, whereas the College of Engineering has its own building. The UE Caloocan grounds have been used for ROTC and CAT instruction since 1986. In 1955, the UE purchased a one-hectare lot along Aurora Boulevard in Quezon City, where it established the College of Medicine. On May 17, 1957, the college was converted into a Foundation and named the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERMMMC). In 1962 the University acquired a 5,850-square meter lot across UERMMMC. This became the Research Center for Sciences, Humanities and Culture, which is home to two buildings. One housed the School of Music and Arts and the Ballet School while the other housed the College of Dentistry and research laboratories. The School of Music and Arts, now the College of Fine Arts, moved to the Caloocan campus in 1981. On the mid 1960s Dalupan commissioned the National Artist Guillermo Tolentino to create the symbol of every UEian, the Lualhati from the figure of CBA student Ophelia Salas. The College of Dentistry moved to the Recto (Manila) campus in school year 1988‚Äì1989. In 1967, the late President Diosdado Macapagal, father of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, decided to teach part-time in the College of Business Administration and branded UE as the \\"People's University\\". Together with the expansion came rapid growth in enrollment. From the original 110 students in 1946, the student population steadily grew each year until 1960, when UE became the first Philippine university have an enrollment of over 60,000. The highest enrollment record was achieved during the first semester of school year 1975‚Äì1976, with 67,443 students registered. Today, the body of UE alumni is over 250,000 strong. The economic crisis and recession that hit the Philippines in the 1980s did not spare UE. The devaluation of the peso, rising inflation, the high cost of wages, coupled with faculty, personnel and student strikes affected UE. Enrollment declined. This period intensified into a crisis that almost led to the school's being sold to a foreign religious group. Financial trouble and academic decline continued to burden UE throughout the 1980s. For a brief period in 1984, a controlling interest in the university was held by an entity of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation movement. Students boycotted classes and held protests against the takeover, and in short time control was returned to stakeholders. Dr. Isidro D. Cari√±o, who became UE president in 1984, began applying measures that included personnel reduction, cost-cutting measures, and renting out school premises and facilities on short- and long-term leases. UE began offering a ladderized curriculum, a special course for executives, programs from the Institute for Computer Studies and Systems, and scholarships for accounting and engineering students. The lease of facilities enabled UE to hold back tuition fee increases in 1986‚Äì1987 and 1987‚Äì1988. When Cari√±o was appointed Secretary of Education of the Philippines in 1990, Panfilo O. Domingo, former President of Philippine National Bank, took over as Chairman of the Board of Trustees and became Chief Executive Officer and Acting President of the University. Domingo immediately worked to cure the financial ills of the University by retiring its short-term debts and instituting fiscal and operational reforms. Within five years, the University's loans were substantially reduced and the long-accumulated operating deficit was eliminated from the books. At the same time, Domingo began a massive rehabilitation of UE's infrastructure and academics. University of the East is one of the most financially stable universities in the Philippines in terms of assets. Realizing that education is the only way to escape poverty, Dr. Lucio C. Tan heavily invested in education. He bought the University of the East in 1990, which he considers his biggest feat in promoting education in the country. In 1992, former Treasurer of the Philippines Rosalina S. Cajucom became UE President. After she retired in mid-1995, Domingo reassumed the presidency until the appointment of Dr. Josefina R. Cortes to the position in 1997. She was succeeded by Mr. Baltazar N. Endriga following her 2003 retirement. UE's programs have seen success from its inception up to the early 1980s, when UE graduates were among the topnotchers list of the CPA board exams. The University has likewise yielded topnotchers in other licensure board exams in Dentistry, Engineering, Education, Medicine, Nursing and Physical Therapy. To date, UE Manila and Caloocan has been granted Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher Education, while most of its Colleges have each been given Level II, III and IV accreditation by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The UERMMMC Colleges, for their part, have been accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Agency of Schools, Colleges and University(PAASCU). Both the College of Medicine and Nursing has level IV accreditation. Recently the University was labeled as \\"One of the Most Wired Universities in the Country\\" by Computerworld and Enterprise Magazine. Featured in the 2006 Computerworld Premier 100 of Computer World Magazine, the university ranked 15 among the top 100 corporations and companies in the use of Information Technology and is the only educational institution on the list. The University migrated from ATM to Gigabit Ethernet to support growing online requirements, expanding online learning capabilities and improving administrative functionality at its Manila campus with an Ethernet networking solution from Nortel Networks. The upgrade will significantly improve speed and performance of student and faculty access to online learning resources and academic records. The upgrade will also support the University's plan for a unified communications network ultimately linking the Manila facility with campuses in Caloocan and Quezon City. Presently the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has identified the University of the East as a Center of Development in Information Technology Education. The Information Technology Department was identified as a Center of Development in Information Technology Education from March 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010. On October 6, 2009, the Commission on Higher Education granted the Autonomous Status to the UE-Manila campus. This is CHED's highest recognition of UE's accomplishments, adherence to quality assurance and commitment to public responsibility and accountability. In September 2011, the University of the East celebrated its 65th Foundation Anniversary. 65 years of Nurturing the minds and Touching the Lives of the Filipino Youth with a theme of RIZAL: Nasa Puso ng UE.

These are among the river's reaches that remain undeveloped and are popular spots for fishing and hiking. The USGS has maintained a gauge (01196620) near Sleeping Giant for the past 41 year to continuously monitor flow. Real time data are available here. A trail is under development that follows the course of the river, especially in the city of New Haven. The lower portion of the river is a fresh tidal system because of the existence of tide gates that cyclically block flow near State Street in New Haven.

[Because the third placement is around opposite the midpoint of the other two, connecting their placements on a single wheel with lines creates an isosceles triangle. However, it is inaccurate to assert that all isosceles triangles in astrological charts are yods. For example, the midpoint semi-sextile (30¬∞ separated) to both the sextile (60¬∞ separated) points would also form an isosceles triangle with it, but would be semi-sextile to the other two instead of quincunx/inconjunct to them.] Astrological chart A Yod is a name for an aspect which forms a triangle shape. The two sextile (60¬∞ apart) planets means that they are harmonious to each other but weak where as the quincunx (150¬∞ apart) planet is incompatible to that pairing as it shares neither polarity (Yin/assertive or yang/receptive), element (fire, water, air, or earth), or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). This aspect activates a powerful conduit of energy, and/or a deeply felt block, in the direction of the third, separated planet. Meaning Astrology explains that raised or multi-aspected planets within the Yod can produce unusual situations and personalities, and should therefore be carefully examined. One possible approach is for an individual to view the yod as an exchange of positive forces around a mediating middle (though oppositional) planet. The quincunxed planet will act as a conduit of energy, or as a profound and deeply felt block. This aspect can produce a heightened direction of energy in the chart which may also oscillate between bifurcated states or situated personalities. A planetary opposition to the quincunxed planet of the Yod can be malefic, or can produce situations of dramatic reversal. The midpoint of the sextile is a very sensitive point in the chart, as transiting planets, when conjunct with this midpoint, will then be in opposition to the quincunxed planet. This situation is said to trigger major events, thus revealing the true power of the Yod. Multiple sextiles and trines involving Yod planets can be extremely beneficial and thus spread the energy of this aspect in one side of the chart or produce a focal point for intense energies on the other side of the chart. Hence, the yod is the most difficult natal chart aspect to interpret and requires a great aptitude in astrological interpretation to divine accurately. Hypothetical example A hypothetical example of a Yod would be with Jupiter at 11¬∞ Pisces in a quincunx angle to Mars at 11¬∞ Leo and the Sun at 11¬∞ Libra. The conflict arises between the worldly, sociable character of Leo and Libra, which tend to seek inspiration in the world, versus the introverted, unworldly character of Pisces, which is too sensitive to be able to cope with worldly life and aims to work in the background serving others. These energies do not interact and hence this hypothetical native would possess great difficulty making the choice between serving others and seeking inspiration on the social stage. Jupiter is in a feminine sign, while the Sun and Mars are both in masculine signs. Jupiter is also in a mutable water sign, while the Sun is in a cardinal air sign and Mars in a fixed fire sign. Jupiter shares neither duality, element, nor mode with the two planets that aspect it in quincunx. This complete lack of commonality of Jupiter with the two sextile planets illustrates how the yod triggers an irritating situation that can be overcome only through adaptation and discovering new paths. If there is no other aspect outlet for Jupiter (as would be reflected in a trine or sextile angle to another planet), a transiting planet in opposition to Jupiter and conjunct the midpoint of the sextile planets can trigger major life events which are difficult to handle and take great creativity to overcome. This is why the yod is often called the \\"Finger of God\\", for it takes great initiative and fortitude to overcome the limitations created by the yod, but great rewards can result if the native does the necessary work. Golden yod Related to the yod, though much less inharmonious and more rarely noticed, is the golden yod. A golden Yod occurs when one planet forms biquintiles (144¬∞ aspect) to two others separated by a quintile(72¬∞ aspect). Because these aspects are seen as beneficial, the golden yod is seen as beneficial and often as reflecting characteristics acquired by the person whose chart contains it. The few astrologers who have studied it regard it as an extremely creatively charged aspect good for artistic skill, especially as quintiles and biquintiles are frequently linked with Neptune. An alternate perspective is that a yod is always an aspect that indicates some kind of dramatic event, or 'fate'; Yods of every type represent extraordinary powers available for good or ill; it is largely a matter of how the individual uses the energy, and whether the planets forming the crucial aspects are in any way harmonious. An example of a golden Yod would be with the Sun at 20¬∞ Cancer, Uranus at 8¬∞ Taurus and Jupiter at 14¬∞ Sagittarius.

It is part of the Punkva Caves and the Punkva River flows through it. The sinkhole is about 138.7 meters deep, which makes it the deepest of its kind (light hole type) in Central Europe. It is a popular tourist attraction for casual visitors to the region, in addition to cavers and advanced technical divers. According to a popular folk story, the abyss got its name after an evil stepmother who married a widowed farmer from a nearby village. The farmer had a son whom she accepted until she gave birth to her own son. Knowing her child wouldn't inherit anything, she decided to lure her step-son to the abyss and throw him into it. Once she realized what she's done, she decided to end her own life by jumping into the very same abyss. Surprisingly, her step-son survived and was eventually saved by his father and other villagers. Another version of the story says that the step-mother didn't commit suicide but was in fact thrown into the abyss after the villagers learnt what she's done to her step-son.

History  Encode was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in September 2003. Intended as a follow-up to the Human Genome Project, the ENCODE project aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome. The project involves a worldwide consortium of research groups, and data generated from this project can be accessed through public databases. The project began its fourth phase in February 2017.  Motivation and Significance  Humans are estimated to have approximately 20,000 protein- coding genes, which account for about 1.5% of DNA in the human genome. The primary goal of the ENCODE project is to determine the role of the remaining component of the genome, much of which was traditionally regarded as \\"junk\\". The activity and expression of protein-coding genes can be modulated by the regulome - a variety of DNA elements, such as promoters, transcriptional regulatory sequences, and regions of chromatin structure and histone modification. It is thought that changes in the regulation of gene activity can disrupt protein production and cell processes and result in disease. Determining the location of these regulatory elements and how they influence gene transcription could reveal links between variations in the expression of certain genes and the development of disease. ENCODE is also intended as a comprehensive resource to allow the scientific community to better understand how the genome can affect human health, and to \\"stimulate the development of new therapies to prevent and treat these diseases\\". The ENCODE Consortium The ENCODE Consortium is composed primarily of scientists who were funded by US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Other participants contributing to the project are brought up into the Consortium or Analysis Working Group. The pilot phase consisted of eight research groups and twelve groups participating in the ENCODE Technology Development Phase. After 2007, the number of participants expanded to 440 scientists based in 32 laboratories worldwide as the pilot phase was officially over. At the moment the consortium consists of different centers which perform different tasks. ENCODE is a member of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC).  The ENCODE Project  ENCODE is currently implemented in four phases: the pilot phase and the technology development phase, which were initiated simultaneously; and the production phase. The fourth phase is a continuation of the third, and includes functional characterization and further integrative analysis for the encyclopedia. The goal of the pilot phase was to identify a set of procedures that, in combination, could be applied cost-effectively and at high-throughput to accurately and comprehensively characterize large regions of the human genome. The pilot phase had to reveal gaps in the current set of tools for detecting functional sequences, and was also thought to reveal whether some methods used by that time were inefficient or unsuitable for large-scale utilization. Some of these problems had to be addressed in the ENCODE technology development phase, which aimed to devise new laboratory and computational methods that would improve our ability to identify known functional sequences or to discover new functional genomic elements. The results of the first two phases determined the best path forward for analyzing the remaining 99% of the human genome in a cost-effective and comprehensive production phase. = The ENCODE Phase I Project: The Pilot Project = The pilot phase tested and compared existing methods to rigorously analyze a defined portion of the human genome sequence. It was organized as an open consortium and brought together investigators with diverse backgrounds and expertise to evaluate the relative merits of each of a diverse set of techniques, technologies and strategies. The concurrent technology development phase of the project aimed to develop new high throughput methods to identify functional elements. The goal of these efforts was to identify a suite of approaches that would allow the comprehensive identification of all the functional elements in the human genome. Through the ENCODE pilot project, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) assessed the abilities of different approaches to be scaled up for an effort to analyse the entire human genome and to find gaps in the ability to identify functional elements in genomic sequence. The ENCODE pilot project process involved close interactions between computational and experimental scientists to evaluate a number of methods for annotating the human genome. A set of regions representing approximately 1% (30 Mb) of the human genome was selected as the target for the pilot project and was analyzed by all ENCODE pilot project investigators. All data generated by ENCODE participants on these regions was rapidly released into public databases.  Target Selection  For use in the ENCODE pilot project, defined regions of the human genome - corresponding to 30Mb, roughly 1% of the total human genome - were selected. These regions served as the foundation on which to test and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a diverse set of methods and technologies for finding various functional elements in human DNA. Prior to embarking upon the target selection, it was decided that 50% of the 30Mb of sequence would be selected manually while the remaining sequence would be selected randomly. The two main criteria for manually selected regions were: 1) the presence of well-studied genes or other known sequence elements, and 2) the existence of a substantial amount of comparative sequence data. A total of 14.82Mb of sequence was manually selected using this approach, consisting of 14 targets that range in size from 500kb to 2Mb. The remaining 50% of the 30Mb of sequence were composed of thirty, 500kb regions selected according to a stratified random- sampling strategy based on gene density and level of non-exonic conservation. The decision to use these particular criteria was made in order to ensure a good sampling of genomic regions varying widely in their content of genes and other functional elements. The human genome was divided into three parts - top 20%, middle 30%, and bottom 50% - along each of two axes: 1) gene density and 2) level of non-exonic conservation with respect to the orthologous mouse genomic sequence (see below), for a total of nine strata. From each stratum, three random regions were chosen for the pilot project. For those strata underrepresented by the manual picks, a fourth region was chosen, resulting in a total of 30 regions. For all strata, a \\"backup\\" region was designated for use in the event of unforeseen technical problems. In greater detail, the stratification criteria were as follows: * Gene density: The gene density score of a region was the percentage of bases covered either by genes in the Ensembl database, or by human mRNA best BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) alignments in the UCSC Genome Browser database. * Non-exonic conservation: The region was divided into non-overlapping subwindows of 125 bases. Subwindows that showed less than 75% base alignment with mouse sequence were discarded. For the remaining subwindows, the percentage with at least 80% base identity to mouse, and which did not correspond to Ensembl genes, GenBank mRNA BLASTZ alignments, Fgenesh++ gene predictions, TwinScan gene predictions, spliced EST alignments, or repeated sequences (DNA), was used as the non-exonic conservation score. The above scores were computed within non-overlapping 500 kb windows of finished sequence across the genome, and used to assign each window to a stratum.  Pilot Phase Results  The pilot phase was successfully finished and the results were published in June 2007 in Nature and in a special issue of Genome Research; the results published in the first paper mentioned advanced the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas, included in the following highlights: * The human genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases are associated with at least one primary transcript and many transcripts link distal regions to established protein-coding loci. * Many novel non-protein- coding transcripts have been identified, with many of these overlapping protein-coding loci and others located in regions of the genome previously thought to be transcriptionally silent. * Numerous previously unrecognized transcription start sites have been identified, many of which show chromatin structure and sequence-specific protein-binding properties similar to well- understood promoters. * Regulatory sequences that surround transcription start sites are symmetrically distributed, with no bias towards upstream regions. * Chromatin accessibility and histone modification patterns are highly predictive of both the presence and activity of transcription start sites. * Distal DNaseI hypersensitive sites have characteristic histone modification patterns that reliably distinguish them from promoters; some of these distal sites show marks consistent with insulator function. * DNA replication timing is correlated with chromatin structure. * A total of 5% of the bases in the genome can be confidently identified as being under evolutionary constraint in mammals; for approximately 60% of these constrained bases, there is evidence of function on the basis of the results of the experimental assays performed to date. * Although there is general overlap between genomic regions identified as functional by experimental assays and those under evolutionary constraint, not all bases within these experimentally defined regions show evidence of constraint. * Different functional elements vary greatly in their sequence variability across the human population and in their likelihood of residing within a structurally variable region of the genome. * Surprisingly, many functional elements are seemingly unconstrained across mammalian evolution. This suggests the possibility of a large pool of neutral elements that are biochemically active but provide no specific benefit to the organism. This pool may serve as a 'warehouse' for natural selection, potentially acting as the source of lineage-specific elements and functionally conserved but non- orthologous elements between species. = The ENCODE Phase II Project: The Production Phase Project = Image of ENCODE data in the UCSC Genome Browser. This shows several tracks containing information on gene regulation. The gene on the left (ATP2B4) is transcribed in a wide variety of cells, (see also the H3K4me1-data.) The gene on the right is only transcribed in a few types of cells, including embryonic stem cells. In September 2007, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) began funding the production phase of the ENCODE project. In this phase, the goal was to analyze the entire genome and to conduct \\"additional pilot-scale studies\\". As in the pilot project, the production effort is organized as an open consortium. In October 2007, NHGRI awarded grants totaling more than $80 million over four years. The production phase also includes a Data Coordination Center, a Data Analysis Center, and a Technology Development Effort. At that time the project evolved into a truly global enterprise, involving 440 scientists from 32 laboratories worldwide. Once the pilot phase was completed, the project ‚Äúscaled up‚Äù in 2007, profiting immensely from new-generation sequencing machines. And the data was, indeed, big; researchers generated around 15 terabytes of raw data. By 2010, over 1,000 genome-wide data sets had been produced by the ENCODE project. Taken together, these data sets show which regions are transcribed into RNA, which regions are likely to control the genes that are used in a particular type of cell, and which regions are associated with a wide variety of proteins. The primary assays used in ENCODE are ChIP-seq, DNase I Hypersensitivity, RNA-seq, and assays of DNA methylation.  Production Phase Results  In September 2012, the project released a much more extensive set of results, in 30 papers published simultaneously in several journals, including six in Nature, six in Genome Biology and a special issue with 18 publications of Genome Research. The authors described the production and the initial analysis of 1,640 data sets designed to annotate functional elements in the entire human genome, integrating results from diverse experiments within cell types, related experiments involving 147 different cell types, and all ENCODE data with other resources, such as candidate regions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and evolutionary constrained regions. Together, these efforts revealed important features about the organization and function of the human genome, which were summarized in an overview paper as follows: # The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical RNA and/or chromatin associated event in at least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event: 95% of the genome lies within 8kb of a DNA-protein interaction (as assayed by bound ChIP-seq motifs or DNaseI footprints), and 99% is within 1.7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE. # Primate-specific elements as well as elements without detectable mammalian constraint show, in aggregate, evidence of negative selection; thus some of them are expected to be functional. # Classifying the genome into seven chromatin states suggests an initial set of 399,124 regions with enhancer-like features and 70,292 regions with promoters-like features, as well hundreds of thousands of quiescent regions. High-resolution analyses further subdivide the genome into thousands of narrow states with distinct functional properties. # It is possible to quantitatively correlate RNA sequence production and processing with both chromatin marks and transcription factor (TF) binding at promoters, indicating that promoter functionality can explain the majority of RNA expression variation. # Many non-coding variants in individual genome sequences lie in ENCODE- annotated functional regions; this number is at least as large as those that lie in protein coding genes. # SNPs associated with disease by GWAS are enriched within non-coding functional elements, with a majority residing in or near ENCODE-defined regions that are outside of protein coding genes. In many cases, the disease phenotypes can be associated with a specific cell type or TF. The most striking finding was that the fraction of human DNA that is biologically active is considerably higher than even the most optimistic previous estimates. In an overview paper, the ENCODE Consortium reported that its members were able to assign biochemical functions to over 80% of the genome. Much of this was found to be involved in controlling the expression levels of coding DNA, which makes up less than 1% of the genome. The most important new elements of the \\"encyclopedia\\" include: *A comprehensive map of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites, which are markers for regulatory DNA that is typically located adjacent to genes and allows chemical factors to influence their expression. The map identified nearly 3 million sites of this type, including nearly all that were previously known and many that are novel. *A lexicon of short DNA sequences that form recognition motifs for DNA-binding proteins. Approximately 8.4 million such sequences were found, comprising a fraction of the total DNA roughly twice the size of the exome. Thousands of transcription promoters were found to make use of a single stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint. *A preliminary sketch of the architecture of the network of human transcription factors, that is, factors that bind to DNA in order to promote or inhibit the expression of genes. The network was found to be quite complex, with factors that operate at different levels as well as numerous feedback loops of various types. *A measurement of the fraction of the human genome that is capable of being transcribed into RNA. This fraction was estimated to add up to more than 75% of the total DNA, a much higher value than previous estimates. The project also began to characterize the types of RNA transcripts that are generated at various locations. = Data Management and Analysis = Capturing, storing, integrating, and displaying the diverse data generated is challenging. The ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) organizes and displays the data generated by the labs in the consortium, and ensures that the data meets specific quality standards when it is released to the public. Before a lab submits any data, the DCC and the lab draft a data agreement that defines the experimental parameters and associated metadata. The DCC validates incoming data to ensure consistency with the agreement. It also ensures that all data is annotated using appropriate Ontologies. It then loads the data onto a test server for preliminary inspection, and coordinates with the labs to organize the data into a consistent set of tracks. When the tracks are ready, the DCC Quality Assurance team performs a series of integrity checks, verifies that the data is presented in a manner consistent with other browser data, and perhaps most importantly, verifies that the metadata and accompanying descriptive text are presented in a way that is useful to our users. The data is released on the public UCSC Genome Browser website only after all of these checks have been satisfied. In parallel, data is analyzed by the ENCODE Data Analysis Center, a consortium of analysis teams from the various production labs plus other researchers. These teams develop standardized protocols to analyze data from novel assays, determine best practices, and produce a consistent set of analytic methods such as standardized peak callers and signal generation from alignment pile-ups. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has identified ENCODE as a \\"community resource project\\". This important concept was defined at an international meeting held in Ft. Lauderdale in January 2003 as a research project specifically devised and implemented to create a set of data, reagents, or other material whose primary utility will be as a resource for the broad scientific community. Accordingly, the ENCODE data release policy stipulates that data, once verified, will be deposited into public databases and made available for all to use without restriction. Other Projects With the continuation of the third phase, the ENCODE Consortium has become involved with additional projects whose goals run parallel to the ENCODE project. Some of these projects were part of the second phase of ENCODE. =modENCODE project= The MODel organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (modENCODE) project is a continuation of the original ENCODE project targeting the identification of functional elements in selected model organism genomes, specifically Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The extension to model organisms permits biological validation of the computational and experimental findings of the ENCODE project, something that is difficult or impossible to do in humans. Funding for the modENCODE project was announced by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2007 and included several different research institutions in the US. The project completed its work in 2012. In late 2010, the modENCODE consortium unveiled its first set of results with publications on annotation and integrative analysis of the worm and fly genomes in Science. Data from these publications is available from the modENCODE web site. modENCODE was run as a Research Network and the consortium was formed by 11 primary projects, divided between worm and fly. The projects spanned the following: * Gene structure * mRNA and ncRNA expression profiling * Transcription factor binding sites * Histone modifications and replacement * Chromatin structure * DNA replication initiation and timing * Copy number variation. modERN modERN, short for the model organism encyclopedia of regulatory networks, branched from the modENCODE project. The project has merged the C. elegans and Drosophila groups and focuses on the identification of additional transcription factor binding sites of the respective organisms. The project began at the same time as Phase III of ENCODE, and plans to end in 2017.https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8566279&icde;=19088980 To date, the project has released 198 experiments,https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&award.project;=modERN&status;=released with around 500 other experiments submitted and currently being processed by the DCC. =Genomics of Gene Regulation= In early 2015, the NIH launched the Genomics of Gene Regulation (GGR) program.https://www.genome.gov/27559930/2015-release-nih-grants-aim-to- decipher-the-language-of-gene-regulation/ The goal of the program, which will last for three years, is to study gene networks and pathways in different systems of the body, with the hopes to further understand the mechanisms controlling gene expressions. Although the ENCODE project is separate from GGR, the ENCODE DCC has been hosting GGR data in the ENCODE portal.https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&award.project;=GGR =Roadmap= In 2008, NIH began the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, whose goal was to produce ‚Äúa public resource of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology and disease-oriented research‚Äù. On February 2015, the consortium released an article titled ‚ÄúIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes‚Äù that fulfilled the consortium‚Äôs goal. The consortium integrated information and annotated regulatory elements across 127 reference epigenomes, 16 of which were part of the ENCODE project. Data for the Roadmap project can either be found in the Roadmap portal or ENCODE portal. =fruitENCODE project= The fruitENCODE: an encyclopedia of DNA elements for fruit ripening is a plant ENCODE project that aims to generate DNA methylation, histone modifications, DHS, gene expression, transcription factor binding datasets for all fleshy fruit species at different developmental stages. Prerelease data can be found in the fruitENCODE portal.  Criticism of the project  Although the consortium claims they are far from finished with the ENCODE project, many reactions to the published papers and the news coverage that accompanied the release were favorable. The Nature editors and ENCODE authors \\"... collaborated over many months to make the biggest splash possible and capture the attention of not only the research community but also of the public at large\\". The ENCODE project's claim that 80% of the human genome has biochemical function was rapidly picked up by the popular press who described the results of the project as leading to the death of junk DNA. However the conclusion that most of the genome is \\"functional\\" has been criticized on the grounds that ENCODE project used a liberal definition of \\"functional\\", namely anything that is transcribed must be functional. This conclusion was arrived at despite the widely accepted view, based on genomic conservation estimates from comparative genomics, that many DNA elements such as pseudogenes that are transcribed are nevertheless non-functional. Furthermore, the ENCODE project has emphasized sensitivity over specificity leading possibly to the detection of many false positives. Somewhat arbitrary choice of cell lines and transcription factors as well as lack of appropriate control experiments were additional major criticisms of ENCODE as random DNA mimics ENCODE-like 'functional' behavior. In response to some of the criticisms, other scientists argued that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of genetic function than genomic conservation estimates because conservation estimates are all relative and difficult to align due to incredible variations in genome sizes of even closely related species, it is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome. Conservation estimates may be used to provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome. Furthermore, much of the genome that is being disputed by critics seems to be involved in epigenetic regulation such as gene expression and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms. The ENCODE results were not necessarily unexpected since increases in attributions of functionality were foreshadowed by previous decades of research. Additionally, others have noted that the ENCODE project from the very beginning had a scope that was based on seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome not evolutionary functional elements, which are not necessarily the same thing since evolutionary selection is neither sufficient nor necessary to establish a function. It is a very useful proxy to relevant functions, but an imperfect one and not the only one. In response to the complaints about the definition of the word \\"function\\" some have noted that ENCODE did define what it meant and since the scope of ENCODE was seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome, then the conclusion of the project should be interpreted \\"as saying that 80 % of the genome is engaging in relevant biochemical activities that are very likely to have causal roles in phenomena deemed relevant to biomedical research.\\" The issue of function is more about definitional differences than about the strength of the project, which was in providing data for further research on biochemical activity of non-protein coding parts of DNA. Though definitions are important and science is bounded by the limits of language, it seems that ENCODE has been well received for its purpose since there are now more research papers using ENCODE data than there are papers arguing over the definition of function, as of March 2013. Ewan Birney, one of the ENCODE researchers, commented that \\"function\\" was used pragmatically to mean \\"specific biochemical activity\\" which included different classes of assays: RNA, \\"broad\\" histone modifications, \\"narrow\\" histone modifications, DNaseI hypersensitive sites, Transcription Factor ChIP-seq peaks, DNaseI Footprints, Transcription Factor bound motifs, and Exons. In 2014, ENCODE researchers noted that in the literature, functional parts of the genome have been identified differently in previous studies depending on the approaches used. There have been three general approaches used to identify functional parts of the human genome: genetic approaches (which rely on changes in phenotype), evolutionary approaches (which rely on conservation) and biochemical approaches (which rely on biochemical testing and was used by ENCODE). All three have limitations: genetic approaches may miss functional elements that do not manifest physically on the organism, evolutionary approaches have difficulties using accurate multispecies sequence alignments since genomes of even closely related species vary considerably, and with biochemical approaches, though having high reproducibility, the biochemical signatures do not always automatically signify a function. They concluded that in contrast to evolutionary and genetic evidence, biochemical data offer clues about both the molecular function served by underlying DNA elements and the cell types in which they act and ultimately all three approaches can be used in a complementary way to identify regions that may be functional in human biology and disease. Furthermore, they noted that the biochemical maps provided by ENCODE were the most valuable things from the project since they provide a starting point for testing how these signatures relate to molecular, cellular, and organismal function. The project has also been criticized for its high cost (~$400 million in total) and favoring big science which takes money away from highly productive investigator-initiated research. The pilot ENCODE project cost an estimated $55 million; the scale-up was about $130 million and the US National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI could award up to $123 million for the next phase. Some researchers argue that a solid return on that investment has yet to be seen. There have been attempts to scour the literature for the papers in which ENCODE plays a significant part and since 2012 there have been 300 papers, 110 of which come from labs without ENCODE funding. An additional problem is that ENCODE is not a unique name dedicated to the ENCODE project exclusively, so the word 'encode' comes up in many genetics and genomics literature. Another major critique is that the results do not justify the amount of time spent on the project and that the project itself is essentially unfinishable. Although often compared to Human Genome Project (HGP) and even termed as the HGP next step, the HGP had a clear endpoint which ENCODE currently lacks. The authors seem to sympathize with the scientific concerns and at the same time try to justify their efforts by giving interviews and explaining ENCODE details not just to the scientific public, but also to mass media. They also claim that it took more than half a century from the realization that DNA is the hereditary material of life to the human genome sequence, so that their plan for the next century would be to really understand the sequence itself.

He is known for writing literary westerns exploring the people and history of the American heartland, notably The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (1983), which was adapted into an acclaimed film. Biography Ron Hansen was born in Omaha, Nebraska and reared as Catholic. He attended a Jesuit high school, Creighton Preparatory School, and earned a Bachelor's degree in English from Creighton University in Omaha in 1970. Following military service, he earned an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1974 and held a Wallace Stegner Creative Writing Fellowship at Stanford University. He later earned an M.A. in Spirituality from Santa Clara University. Hansen is the Gerard Manley Hopkins, S.J. Professor in the Arts and Humanities at Santa Clara University, where he teaches courses in writing and literature. He is married to the writer Bo Caldwell. In January 2007, Hansen was ordained as a permanent deacon of the Catholic Church. In May 2009, Hansen was inducted to the college of fellows at Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology. Awards and fellowships Hansen has received fellowships from the Michigan Society of Fellows, the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and the Lyndhurst Foundation, as well as an Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Novels and short stories Hansen frequently writes novels about the Old West, mixing history with morality and drama. Hansen's first novel, Desperadoes (1979), reimagines the story of the Dalton Gang. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, a 1983 novel chronicling the life and death of the iconic outlaw, was Hansen's most popular work. It also brought him wide critical acclaim, and was nominated to the short list for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Most recently (2016), Hansen has explored the life of Billy the Kid in a novel titled simply The Kid. Catholic themes of love, redemption and resurrection recur in Hansen's novels and stories. Mariette in Ecstasy (1991), his novel of the faith and religious experience in the context of a cloistered Catholic nun who apparently bears the stigmata, earned him near universal critical praise. He won the fiction prize from the Bay Area Reviewers Association and the Gold Medal for Excellence in Fiction from the Commonwealth Club of California. Hansen's novel, Exiles (2008), tells in parallel the story of the shipwreck of the SS Deutschland, which cost the lives of five young nuns, and the story of poet Gerard Manley Hopkins who was inspired by the tragedy to write The Wreck of the Deutschland. Hansen's 1996 novel, Atticus, about the bond of love between a father and a son who has died under mysterious circumstances in a dusty Mexican town, was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Hitler's Niece (1999) is a historical novel that offers a view of Hitler as seen through the eyes of Geli Raubal, the daughter of his half-sister. Isn't It Romantic? (2003) is a comic novel about two sophisticated Parisians stranded in small-town Nebraska. Hansen has published numerous short stories in literary magazines nationwide. His short story collection, Nebraska, was published in 1989. Hansen also edited the anthology You Don't Know What Love Is: Contemporary American Stories (1987) and co- edited with Jim Shepard You've Got to Read This: Contemporary American Writers Introduce Stories That Held Them in Awe (1994). In addition to his novels and short stories, Hansen has published a compilation of essays on faith and fiction (A Stay Against Confusion) and a children's book (The Shadowmaker). Hansen also wrote the screenplay for the 1996 film adaptation of Mariette in Ecstasy. Adaptations *In 2000, Atticus was adapted into the film Missing Pieces starring James Coburn. *In 2006, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was adapted for the screen in a film written and directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Brad Pitt as James. The film was edited for a September 21, 2007 release. *In 2009, Mariette in Ecstasy was adapted for the stage and produced at Lifeline Theatre in Chicago. *Hansen co- wrote the screenplay for the 2020 film The World to Come along with Jim Shepard, from Shepard's short story.

It is used in high-power and high-frequency electronics because of its superior electron velocity with respect to the more common semiconductors silicon and gallium arsenide. It is used mainly in HEMT and HBT structures, but also for the fabrication of high efficiency solar cells used for space applications and, in combination with aluminium (AlGaInP alloy) to make high brightness LEDs with orange-red, orange, yellow, and green colors. Some semiconductor devices such as EFluor Nanocrystal use InGaP as their core particle. Indium gallium phosphide is a solid solution of indium phosphide and gallium phosphide. Ga0.5In0.5P is a solid solution of special importance, which is almost lattice matched to GaAs. This allows, in combination with (AlxGa1‚àíx)0.5In0.5, the growth of lattice matched quantum wells for red emitting semiconductor lasers, e.g. red emitting (650nm) RCLEDs or VCSELs for PMMA plastic optical fibers. Ga0.5In0.5P is used as the high energy junction on double and triple junction photovoltaic cells grown on GaAs. Recent years have shown GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells with AM0 (sunlight incidence in space=1.35 kW/m2) efficiencies in excess of 25%. A different composition of GaInP, lattice matched to the underlying GaInAs, is utilized as the high energy junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple junction photovoltaic cells. Growth of GaInP by epitaxy can be complicated by the tendency of GaInP to grow as an ordered material, rather than a truly random solid solution (i.e., a mixture). This changes the bandgap and the electronic and optical properties of the material.

His works have been associated with the minimalist style of composition, and in the late 1970s with the New Simplicity movement. He is the son of the film director Peter Hamel. Hamel studied musical composition, psychology and sociology in Munich and Berlin with teachers including G√ºnter Bialas and Carl Dahlhaus. He then continued his education abroad, spending several extensive periods in Asia . In 1970, he founded \\"Between\\", an international group dedicated to improvisational music with whom he made 6 records on the intuition/WERGO label and in 1978 in Munich, he founded the Freies Musikzentrum, an institute for musical education and therapy. In 1978, his book Through Music to the Self was published in English translation, obtaining wide circulation in Europe and the U.S. Between 1997 and 2012, he was professor for composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater in Hamburg . His orchestral and chamber music is published by Schott, B√§renreiter and E.R.P./Celestial Harmonies. He composed four operas, many orchestral works (e.g., Gestalt), violin and piano concertos, sacred works for soprano, choirs and orchestra (e.g., Missa); Shoah (a radio-composition about the Holocaust), chamber-music compositions (including four string quartets). He is in demand as a performing artist (piano, prepared piano, pipe organ, voice and live- electronics). His First Symphony was premiered by Sergiu Celibidache in 1988; his Second Symphony had its first performance in Munich on April 29, 2008 with the Munich Philharmonic.

Background The official name of the country during the last 30 years of Communist rule was \\"Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\\" (in Czech and in Slovak , or ƒåSSR). In December 1989‚Äîa month after the Velvet Revolution‚ÄîPresident V√°clav Havel announced that the word \\"Socialist\\" would be dropped from the country's official name. Conventional wisdom suggested that it would be known as simply the \\"Czechoslovak Republic\\"‚Äîits official name from 1920 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1960. However, Slovak politicians felt this diminished Slovakia's equal stature, and demanded that the country's name be spelled with a hyphen (i.e. \\"Czecho-Slovak Republic\\"), as it was spelled from Czecho-slovak independence in 1918 until 1920, and again in 1938 and 1939. President Havel then changed his proposal to \\"Republic of Czecho-Slovakia\\" ‚Äî a proposal that did not sit well with Czech politicians who saw reminders of the 1938 Munich Agreement, in which Nazi Germany annexed a part of that territory. Resolution As a compromise, on 29 March 1990 the Czechoslovak parliament resolved that the country's long name was to be the \\"Czechoslovak Federative Republic,\\" explicitly acknowledging that the country was a federation. The name was to be spelled without a hyphen in Czech (), but with a hyphen in Slovak (). An informal agreement on the Slovak long-form name was to be codified in a future law on state symbols. This solution was found to be unsatisfactory, and less than a month later, on 20 April 1990, the parliament changed the name again, to the \\"Czech and Slovak Federative Republic\\" (, , or ƒåSFR). This law explicitly listed the long-form names in both languages and stated they were equal., 20 April 1990 (Constitutional law about the change of the name of the Czecho-slovak Federative Republic) The compromise required even more linguistic wrangling than first appears. Generally, only the first word of a country's name is capitalized in Czech and Slovak. Capitalizing all of the words eliminated issues of prestige around the capitalization of \\"\\". Although the Slovaks were demanding a hyphen (Czech, Slovak: ), the Czechs called it a dash (Czech, Slovak: ). Although there is a clear difference between a hyphen and a dash in Czech and Slovak spelling (a hyphen is used to mark a connection between two words, while a dash is used in other cases), both Czechs and Slovaks usually use the term for both. Nonetheless, English language media generally refer to the conflict as the \\"Hyphen War\\". While the Hyphen War was not really deserving of the name \\"war\\", it demonstrated that there were differences between Czechs and Slovaks regarding the identity of their shared country. Over the following two years, more substantial disputes arose between the two halves of the federation. In 1992, Czech and Slovak politicians agreed to split the country into the two states of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic‚Äîthe so-called Velvet Divorce‚Äîwhich became effective on 1 January 1993.

It is one of the largest transit providers in the state of Tennessee, MATA transports customers in the City of Memphis and parts of Shelby County on fixed route buses, paratransit vehicles, and the MATA Trolley system. The system is managed by a seven-member policy board appointed by the mayor and approved by the Memphis City Council. System background The system was formed in 1975 to service the greater Memphis and Shelby County Tennessee area and nearby West Memphis, Arkansas. MATA is run by a general manager and a nine-member board of commissioners, appointed by the Mayor of Memphis and approved by the Memphis City Council.MATA website. The transit agency operates 240 buses, mostly Gillig Advantage low-floors (both diesel and diesel/electric hybrids) on 42 routes. In the past, its roster included GM TDH-5300 and TDH-4500 \\"New Looks\\" and Flxible 40-102 New Look series (carryovers from its predecessor prior to MATA's formation), AM General 40 ft., MAN articulateds, the RTS series from GM, TMC and NovaBus, Neoplan artics, and NovaBus LFS low floors buses. The RTS series were MATA's preferred fleet of choice, having been used in its lineup from February 1980 until its retirement in April 2010, when the six remaining 1994 NovaBus versions were replaced with the Gillig Advantage Hybrids. MATA hopes to shift to a hybrid fleet in the future. =Rail service= MATA also operates a trolley service. Initially opened in 1993, the Main Street Trolley Line uses classic streetcars on a system that has grown to three routes: one along the riverfront, another serving Main Street in the heart of downtown Memphis, and an extension on Madison Avenue. The Madison Avenue line opened in 2004, as the initial stage of a light rail system that would connect downtown Memphis with the Memphis International Airport and eventually to regional transit service beyond the MATA service boundaries.

A firm Calvinist, he was a leader of mercenary troops in the religious wars of the time, including the Dutch Revolt. From 1583-1592 he acted as regent for his nephew, Elector Palatine Frederick IV. Career Statue of John Casimir in Heidelberg Castle Count Palatine John Casimir was born in Simmern as the third son of Frederick III, Elector Palatine, and Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, of the Simmern middle electoral line of the House of Wittelsbach. In 1564 John Casimir suggested himself as a bridegroom for Elizabeth I of England and sent her his portrait via the Scottish courtier Sir James Melville. Elizabeth, however, showed no interest in him. On 26 November 1568 he was engaged to the 16-year-old Lutheran Elisabeth of Saxony, a daughter of Augustus, Elector of Saxony and his first wife Anne of Denmark. The wedding took place in Heidelberg on June 6, 1570. The marriage was political, as John Casimir wanted to link Calvinism to Saxony through the marriage. Their marriage turned out to be unhappy, and not only because of religious differences. John Casimir ordered his wife under house arrest accusing her of adultery. Elisabeth gave birth to six children, three of whom were stillborn; the other three were daughters. She died in prison on April 2, 1590. Coat of arms of John Casimir encircled by the Order of the Garter. John Casimir as depicted in a contemporary reference work. Drawing of Johann Casimir and his wife Elisabeth in wedding outfit The text reads \\"Ioannes Casimirus Palatinus Rheni Dux Bavari√¶ Etc.\\" From March, 1571 Johann Casimir resided in Kaiserslautern for a decade. When his father died in 1576, he ordered in his will that the Palatinate was to remain Calvinist. His son, Louis VI, inherited the main part of the Palatinate, including Heidelberg, and John Casimir inherited a smaller portion, which became the independent Count Palatine of Lautern (essentially consisting of the city of Kaiserslautern and surrounding area). John Casimir's brother Ludwig, who had been secretly raised by his mother as a Lutheran, did not honor his father's wish and instead supported Lutheranism. Many professors of theology, including Zacharias Ursinus, left the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg and were welcomed to Lautern by Johann Casimir who built the Collegium Casimirianum in Neustadt as a substitute university for them in 1578. John Casimir was in regular contact with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his nephew Sir Philip Sidney who, as agent for Elizabeth I, was sent to the continent to assist in the formation of a Protestant league. In 1576, John Casimir entered France leading four thousand troops. As a result of this campaign, he was made duc d‚Äô√âtampes by Henry III of France for a few months, in 1576-1577\\\\. This was a theoretical position, as he never actually visited his French duchy. Bernard Gineste: \\"Jean Casimir duc d‚Äô√âtampes (1576-1577)\\", Corpus Etampois, 2004 He visited England in 1579 to seek the Queen's financial support for his campaigns on behalf of the United Provinces. In February 1579 the Earl of Leicester took him to Oxford and he was entertained for three weeks at the English court. From 1583 to 1592 Casimir acted as regent for his nephew Elector Frederick IV.

Typically, these are put along major roads such as highways, freeways, motorways, autoroutes and expressways, as well as arterial roads, and are connected with optical fibers buried alongside or even under the road, with electrical power either provided by mains power in urban areas, or via solar panels or another alternate power source which provides consistent imagery without the threat of a power outage during inclement conditions. A monitoring center receives the live video in real time, and serves as a dispatcher if there is a traffic collision or some other disruptive incident or road safety issue. Traffic cameras are a major part of most intelligent transportation systems. They are especially valuable in tunnels, where safety equipment can be activated remotely based upon information provided by the cameras and other sensors. On surface roads, they are typically mounted on high poles or masts, sometimes along with street lights. On arterial roads, they are often mounted on traffic light poles at intersections, where problems are most likely to occur. In remote areas without easy reach of the main electrical grid, they are usually powered by another means such as solar power, which also provides a backup source to urban camera infrastructure. Traffic cameras are distinct from road safety cameras, which are put in specific places to enforce rules of the road. Those cameras take still photos in a much higher image resolution upon a trigger, whereas traffic cameras are simply for observation and constantly take lower-resolution video, often in full motion, though they are remotely controllable in order to focus on an ongoing traffic incident farther along a road that may not be in the camera's usual field of view or even along a frontage road or other roadway within its field of vision. Many transmit in the legacy analog NTSC and PAL formats, depending on location, though many are being converted to high definition or 4K resolution video as equipment is replaced. Some have a compass built in which displays the cardinal direction at which the camera is aimed, though many providers also provide a reference image of a shot with the cardinal direction. Many transportation departments have linked their camera networks to the Internet on online websites, thus making them webcams which allow commuters to view current traffic conditions. They may show either streaming video or still imagery which refreshes at a set interval of seconds or minutes, helping travelers determine whether an alternate route should be taken. In the United States and Canada, these often are displayed on state or municipally-run 5-1-1 websites (511 being a telephone number designed to relay current traffic information). These traffic images are also combined with road sensors which measure traffic timing to provide a full picture of traffic conditions. Many states and provinces consider this information public domain, thus many television stations air live traffic camera imagery during their own traffic reports on their local news broadcasts, or simply as an augmenting moving visual background during newscasts. Some cable TV systems provide these pictures full-time on a governmental access channel, and some broadcast stations set aside a full digital subchannel solely for traffic information and camera imagery, such as Philadelphia's WPHL-DT4 in the past and WMVT-DT3 in Milwaukee and WFMZ-DT2 in Allentown, Pennsylvania currently. However, in some cases for toll roads and other private road authorities, such as the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, these images are claimed to be the property of the toll agency (or private company which runs a toll road), and the images are held under an exclusivity agreement for one station (in the ISTHA's case, they only air on WMAQ-TV).

Pgs. 235-238 His father Rabah was an Arab slave for the clan of Banu Jumah while his mother, Hamamah, was allegedly a former princess of Abyssinia who was captured after the event of Amul-Fill (the attempt to destroy the Ka'aba) and put into slavery. Being born into slavery, Bilal had no other option but to work for his master, Umayyah ibn Khalaf. Through hard work, Bilal became recognised as a good slave and was entrusted with the keys to the Idols of Arabia. However, racism and sociopolitical statutes of Arabia prevented Bilal from achieving a lofty position in society. Bilal's appearance In his book, Bilal ibn Rabah, Muhammad Abdul-Rauf states that Bilal \\"was of a handsome and impressive stature, dark brown complexion with sparkling eyes, a fine nose and bright skin. He was also gifted with a deep, melodious, resonant voice. He wore a beard which was thin on both cheeks. He was endowed with great wisdom and a sense of dignity and self esteem.\\"Abdul-Rauf, Muhammad. BilƒÅl Ibn RabƒÅh: A Leading Companion of The Prophet Muhammad (SAW). Indianapolis, Indiana: American Trust Publications, 1977. Print.

The Life of Mohammad From Original Sources. Edinburgh: J. Grant, 1923. Print. Pg. 59 Muir also states that noble members of the Quraysh despised Bilal and called him \\"Ibn Sawda\\" (son of the black woman). Conversion to Islam When Muhammad announced his prophethood and started to preach the message of Islam, Bilal renounced idol worship, becoming one of the earliest converts to the faith.Sodiq, Yushau. Insider's Guide to Islam. Bloomington, Indiana: Trafford, 2011. Print. Pg. 23 =Persecution of Bilal= Bilal ibn Rabah being whipped after he declared his Islamic Faith. When Bilal's slave master, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, found out, he began to torture Bilal. At the instigation of Abu Jahl, Umayyah bound Bilal and had him dragged around Mecca as children mocked him. Bilal refused to renounce Islam, instead repeating \\"Ahad Ahad\\" (God is absolute/one). Incensed at Bilal's refusal, Umayyah ordered that Bilal be whipped and beaten while spread-eagled upon the Arabian sands under the desert sun, his limbs bound to stakes. When Bilal still refused to recant, Umayyah ordered that a hot boulder be placed on Bilal's chest. However, Bilal remained firm in belief and continued to say \\"Ahad Ahad\\". =Bilal's emancipation = News of the persecution of Bilal reached some of Muhammad's companions, who informed the prophet. Muhammad sent Abu Bakr to negotiate for the emancipation of Bilal, who manumitted him after either purchasing him or exchanging him for a non- Muslim slave.Ibn Hisham, Sirah, V. 1, p. 339-340Ibn Sa‚Äôd, Tabaqat, V. 3, p. 232 Umar ibn al-Khattab said the following upon the emancipation of Bilal:  Bilal in Madina  In the newly formed Islamic state of Madina, Bilal had become a prominent contributing member of the Muslim society taking on important roles. =Adhan= Muhammad chose Bilal as the first mu'azzin (reciter of the Adhan).Ludwig W. Adamec (2009), Historical Dictionary of Islam, p.68. Scarecrow Press. . Quote: \\"Bilal, ..., was the first mu'azzin.\\" Sunni view The majority of mosques around the world recite the Athan according to the Sunni tradition. A dream was seen by Abdullah Ibn Zaid where an angel in the form of a man wearing a green garment taught the words of the adhan. The Prophet then instructed Abdullah to teach those words to Bilal because he had a louder voice than him. Umar ibn al-Khattab also saw the same dream. The detail of this story is mentioned below. It is narrated in Sunan Ibn Majah that Abdullah bin Zaid said the following: Shia view Shias, on the other hand, do not accept Abdullah ibn Ziyad's story. They state that the Adhan was revealed to Muhammad just as the Qur'an al-Majid was revealed to him. Shias believe that the Adhan could not be left to the dreams or reveries. Furthermore, Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy states, \\"If the Prophet could teach the Muslims how to perform prostrations, and how, when, and what to say in each prayer, he could also teach them how and when to alert others before the time for each prayer.\\" According to the Shia traditions, the angel who taught Muhammad how to perform ablutions preparatory to prayers and how to perform prayers also taught him the Adhan. =Treasury= Bilal rose to prominence in the Islamic community of Medina, as Muhammad appointed him minister of the Bayt al-Mal (treasury).Charbonneau, Joshua (Mateen).

Muhammad's forces included Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Dharr al- Ghifari, Abu Bakr, Umar, Mus\`ab ibn \`Umair, and Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam. The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel.Lings, pp. 138‚Äì139 However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected, and the future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care for his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad. Salman the Persian also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man. His piety Bilal was among the sahabah promised Paradise in this world, as mentioned in the story of his footsteps being heard in paradise. After Muhammad =Sunni view= In the Sƒ´rat Abƒ´ Bakr Al- ·π¢iddƒ´q that compiled many narrations and compiled historical circumstances regarding the rule of Caliph Abu Bakr, Bilal accompanied the Muslim armies, under the commands of Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi, to Syria.Dr. Ali Muhammad As- Sallaabee The Biography of Abu Bakr As-Sideeq. Riyadh: Maktaba Dar-us-Salaam, 2007. Print. =Shia view= After Muhammad died in 632 AD, Bilal was one of the people who did not give bay'ah (the oath of allegiance) to Abu Bakr.Shustari, Nurullah, Majalisu'1-Mu'minin (Tehran, 1268 AH) p. 54; and also see Ibn Sa'd, op. cit., vol.

Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia. New York: Routledge, 2006. Print. Pg. 109 It is documented that when Bilal did not give bay'ah to Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al- Khattab grabbed Bilal by his clothes and asked, \\"Is this the reward of Abu Bakr; he emancipated you and you are now refusing to pay allegiance to him? Bilal replied, \\"If Abu Bakr had emancipated me for the pleasure of Allah, then let him leave me alone for Allah; and if he had emancipated me for his service, then I am ready to render him the services required. But I am not going to pay allegiance to a person whom the Messenger of God had not appointed as his caliph.\\" Similarly, al-Isti'ab, a Sunni source, states that Bilal told Abu Bakr: \\"If you have emancipated me for yourself, then make me a captive again; but if you had emancipated me for Allah, then let me go in the way of Allah.\\" This was said when Bilal wanted to go for Jihad. Abu Bakr then let him go.\\"Abdullah, Ysuf. al-Isti'ab. Print. Pg.150 The following is a poem by Bilal on his refusal to give Abu Bakr bay'ah: : By Allah! I did not turn towards Abu Bakr, : If Allah had not protected me, : hyena would have stood on my limbs. : Allah has bestowed on me good : and honoured me, : Surely there is vast good with Allah. : You will not find me following an innovator, : Because I am not an innovator, as they are. Being exiled from Medina by Umar and Abu Bakr, Bilal migrated to Syria. Abu Ja'far al-Tusi, a Shia scholar, has also stated in lkhtiyar al-Rijal that Bilal refused to pay allegiance to Abu Bakr. =Sufism= Purnam Allahabadi, a Sufi poet whose works originated from the Mughal Empire, composed a Qawwali in which he mentioned how time had stopped when some companions blocked Bilal from delivering the Adhan (which he had seen in his dream), and appealed that it was incorrect.http://www.hamzashad.com/bhar-do-jholi/ Because the companion Bilal was of an Abyssinian origin, he could not pronounce the letter \\"Sh\\" (Arabic: Shin ÿ¥ ). A hadith of Muhammad reports that he said, \\"The 'seen' of Bilal is 'sheen' in the hearing of Allah,\\" meaning God does not look at the external but appreciates the purity of heart.Bilal Ibn Rabah Al-Habashi Death Grave of Bilal in Bab al-Saghir cemetery, Damascus. The Sunni scholar al-Suyuti in his Tarikh al-khulafa wrote: \\"He (Bilal) died in Damascus in 17 or 18 AH, but some say 20 AH, or even 21 AH when he was just over sixty years old. Some said he died in Medina, but that is wrong. That is how it is in al-Isabah and other works such as the Tahdhib of an-Nawawi.\\"Rijal: Narrators of the Muwatta of Imam Muhammad.\\" Bogvaerker. N.p., 08 Jan. 2005. Web. 2013. When Bilal's wife realized that death was approaching Bilal, she became sorrowful.Qu≈°airƒ´, Abd- al-Karƒ´m Ibn-HÃ≤awƒÅzin Al-, and Abu'l-Qasim al-Qushayri. al-Qushayri's Epistle on Sufism: al-Risala al-Qushayriyya Fi 'ilm al-Tasawwuf. Trans. Alexander D. Knysh. Lebanon: Garnet & Ithaca Press, 2007. Print. Pg.313 It is documented that she cried and said, \\"What a painful affliction!\\" However, Bilal objected his wife's opinion by stating, \\"On the contrary, what a happy occasion! Tomorrow I will meet my beloved Muhammad and his faction (hizb)!\\" He is believed to have been buried in the Bab al-Saghir cemetery, Damascus. But there's another shrine believed to be the burial of Bilal near a small village called al-Rabahiyya, in Amman, Jordan. Descendants and legacy The descendants of Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi are said to have migrated to the land of Ethiopia in East Africa.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein. The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity. New York, New York: HarperCollins, 2009. Print. Pg. 92 The Imperial family of Mali in West Africa also claims descent from him. Another alleged tomb of Bilal in Amman, Jordan Though there are some disagreements concerning the hard facts of Bilal's life and death, his importance on a number of levels is incontestable. Mu'azzins, especially those in Turkey and Africa, have traditionally venerated the original practitioner of their profession. The story of Bilal is the most frequently cited demonstration of Islam's views of measure people not by their nationality nor social status nor race, but measuring people by their Taqwah (piety). In 1874, Edward Wilmot Blyden, a former slave of African descent, wrote: \\"The eloquent Adzan or Call to Prayer, which to this day summons at the same hours millions of the human race to their devotions, was first uttered by a Negro, Bilal by name, whom Mohammed, in obedience to a dream, appointed the first Mu'azzin. And it has been remarked that even Alexander the Great is in Asia an unknown personage by the side of this honoured Negro.\\"\\"Mohammedanism and The Negro Race.\\" Fraser's Magazine, July Dec. 1875: 598-615.

The stuffed crust pizza was popularized by Pizza Hut, which debuted this style of pizza in 1995. History Brazilian entrepreneur Rubens Augusto Junior, founder of Patroni, a Brazilian pizza chain, claims to have invented stuffed crust in 1986. Pizza Hut introduced stuffed crust pizza; created by Patty Scheibmeir and launched on March 25, 1995. Pizza Hut was sued by the family of Anthony Mongiello for $1 billion, over claims that Pizza Hut's stuffed crust infringed on Mongiello's 1987 patent (US4661361A) on making stuffed pizza shells. Pizza Hut was found to have not infringed on the Patent in 1999, the court stating \\"...[the] plaintiff does not have a product patent, and its method patent is not infringed simply because some examples of defendant's completed product approximate plaintiff's product.\\". DiGiorno began offering a cheese stuffed crust pizza in grocery stores in 2001.

Savannah was formerly the steamer Everglade, built in 1856 at New York City. She was purchased early in 1861 by the State of Georgia and converted into a gunboat for coast defense. With Georgia's admission to the Confederacy, Savannah, under Lieutenant John Newland Maffitt, was commissioned by the Confederate States Navy. She was attached to the squadron of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, charged with the naval defense of South Carolina and Georgia. On November 5-6, 1861, Savannah, flying Tattnall's flag, in company with CSS Resolute, CSS Sampson, and CSS Lady Davis, offered harassing resistance to a much larger Union fleet, under Flag Officer Samuel Francis Du Pont, preparing to attack Confederate strongholds at Port Royal Sound, South Carolina On November 7, Savannah fired on the heavy Union ships as they bombarded Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard. Driven finally by the Federal gunboats into Skull Creek, Georgia, Tattnall disembarked with a landing party in an abortive attempt to support the fort's garrison, and Savannah returned to Savannah, Georgia to repair damages. On November 26, 1861, Savannah, in company with Resolute and Sampson, all under Flag Officer Tattnall, weighed anchor from under the guns of Fort Pulaski, Georgia, and made a brave, but brief attack on Union vessels at the mouth of the Savannah River. On January 28, 1862, the same three vessels delivered supplies to the fort despite the spirited opposition of Federal ships. Savannah later assisted in the unsuccessful defense of Fort Pulaski on April 10-11, 1862, and for the remainder of the year served as a receiving ship at the city of Savannah. Her name was changed to Oconee on April 28, 1863, and in June she was loaded with cotton and dispatched to England to pay for much-needed supplies. After some delay she escaped to sea, only to founder on August 18 during bad weather. A boat with four officers and eleven men was captured two days later; the remainder of her crew escaped.

The chain was part of the widespread popularity of drive-ins during the 1950s and 1960s, and still operates several locations. Dog n Suds serves fast-food staples including hamburgers, french fries, and soft drinks. History Dog n Suds Root Beer, which was bottled and sold in stores The first Dog n Suds was opened in 1953 in Champaign, Illinois, by University of Illinois music teachers James Griggs and Don Hamacher. The chain grew rapidly throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and a training center was established in Champaign, named \\"Rover College\\" after the dog on the restaurant signage. At its peak in 1968, the chain had about 650 restaurants. Griggs sold his interest in the business in the early 1970s. The company was sold to Frostie Enterprises in 1974, who owned the Frostie and Stewart's brands of root beer.https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1475931840 Frostie later abandoned the franchise business and sold the rights to make Dog-n-Suds branded root beer to Don and Carol VanDame, owners of a Dog n Suds in Lafayette, Indiana. In 1991, the VanDames purchased the Dog n Suds trademark and identity rights. In 2001, they created a new company, TK&C;'s LLC, to administer licensing rights for the brand. Don Hamacher died on January 4, 2013.  Locations  There are sixteen Dog n Suds locations open across the United States. There is one location in Paragould, Arkansas, one location in Greeley, Colorado, four locations in Illinois, four locations and a food truck in Indiana, two locations in Michigan, two locations in Ohio, and one location in Tomahawk, Wisconsin.

After playing college baseball for the University of Kentucky, the Athletics selected in the 2002 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2004. While pitching for the Phillies, he was a member of the 2008 World Series champions. Blanton continued to pitch in MLB through 2013, when he retired in 2014. Blanton returned from retirement to pitch in MLB from 2015 through 2017. Amateur career Joe Blanton was born in Nashville, Tennessee, but grew up in Chalybeate, Kentucky.The Rotation: A Season with the Phillies and the Greatest Pitching Staff, By Jim Salisbury, Todd Zolecki, page 92 He graduated from Franklin-Simpson High School in 1999. He attended the University of Kentucky and played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats, with a 13‚Äì12 record from 2000 to 2002, and led the Southeastern Conference with 133 strikeouts in his final season, finishing with a 4.59 earned run average (ERA). In 2001 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves. Professional career =Minor leagues= The Oakland Athletics selected Blanton in the first round, with the 24th overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft, This draft was chronicled by Michael Lewis in his book, Moneyball. In 2003, while pitching for the Kane County Cougars and the Midland RockHounds, Blanton ranked second in all of Minor League Baseball with a combined 174 strikeouts. The next season, he helped the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats win the Pacific Coast League Championship with an 11‚Äì8 record and a 4.19 ERA. He struck out 143 batters in 176 innings, tossing one complete game in 26 starts. =Oakland Athletics= Blanton made his major league debut on September 21, 2004, against the Texas Rangers. He made three appearances and pitched eight innings. He posted a 5.63 ERA, but did not get a decision in any of his games. Blanton with the Athletics In 2005, Blanton joined the starting rotation that had lost pitchers Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson to trades. He made his first start on April 8 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, pitching five innings and allowing two runs. After losing his first five decisions, he picked up his first win when he worked seven innings against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 4. Blanton was third on the team in innings pitched, but still exceeded 200 innings in his first full season. He posted a 12‚Äì12 record with a 3.53 ERA in 33 starts, and his 33 starts set an Oakland rookie record for most games started which had broken the previous mark of 32 set by Matt Keough in 1978. His ERA was best among all rookies with 100 or more innings pitched. He also tied the Oakland rookie record for most wins in a season with 12. His first career complete game came as a 1‚Äì0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on April 24, 2005; he was the only rookie to post two complete games in 2005. Blanton's high loss total was attributed to poor run support, as the A's only posted six runs total in all twelve of his losses combined, while posting 62 runs in his 12 wins. Blanton was also named the American League Rookie of the Month for June, as he tied with teammate Dan Haren for the AL lead in wins and finished third in ERA in June. In 2006, Blanton's ERA rose over a full point to 4.82 and gave up the fifth highest number of hits in the American League (241), resulting in a .309 batting average against. However, he had four more wins than the previous year, posting a 16‚Äì12 record, striking out 107 batters and walking 58. He pitched his first career complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals on May 31. Blanton did not pitch in the ALDS for the Athletics, but was named to the roster for the ALCS, where he pitched two innings in one appearance, allowing no hits or runs. Blanton had a 14‚Äì10 record in 230 innings pitched in 2007. He struck out 140 batters, walked 40, and gave up 101 earned runs, resulting in a 3.95 ERA for the year. Though Blanton's road and home records were the same (7‚Äì5), his home ERA was 2.69 compared with 5.11 on the road. He also pitched three complete games in 2007, but his first one of the season was his third career complete-game loss, on April 25. Blanton made his 100th career appearance at the end of the season, a 7‚Äì3 win against the Texas Rangers on September 15. The A's traded Blanton, who had a 5‚Äì12 record and a 4.96 ERA to the Philadelphia Phillies for second baseman Adrian C√°rdenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer on July 17, 2008. =Philadelphia Phillies= Blanton with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2011 In Blanton's first start for the Phillies, he pitched six innings and allowed five runs; however, he did not factor in the decision as the Phillies scored six runs off the New York Mets' bullpen in the ninth inning to win. On August 2, Blanton recorded his first win as a Phillie against the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 2‚Äì1 in his third Phillies start. For the season, 51% of his strikeouts were \\"looking\\", the highest percentage in the majors. In Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, Blanton hit his first major league home run to become the 13th pitcher overall and first since Ken Holtzman in 1974 to hit a home run in a World Series game. He was also credited with the win in the Phillies' Game 4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching six innings and allowing two runs on four hits.https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/joe-blanton-phillies-rock- rays-10-2-3-1-world-series-lead-article-1.305429 On January 21, 2010, the Phillies announced Blanton agreed to a three-year extension worth $24 million. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On August 3, 2012, Blanton was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later (minor league prospect Ryan O'Sullivan). He started 10 games for the Dodgers and was 2‚Äì4 with a 4.99 ERA. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= In December 2012, Blanton signed a two- year contract worth $15 million with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Blanton would go on to finish the 2013 season with a disappointing 2‚Äì14 record and a 6.04 ERA. Most of his struggles were attributed to the home run ball, giving up 29 in 132.2 innings. On March 26, 2014, Blanton was granted his unconditional release from the Angels. =Second stint with the Oakland Athletics= On March 31, 2014, the Oakland Athletics signed Blanton to a minor league deal and sent him to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. He made two starts in the minors and then on April 13, 2014, Blanton announced his retirement from baseball. After working out in the offseason with Gallatin, Tennessee, neighbor and fellow pitcher Zach Duke, Blanton announced that he would attempt a comeback for the 2015 season. He pitched in a pro day at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin to demonstrate his pitching for potential major league clubs. =Kansas City Royals= On February 13, 2015, Blanton signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. Blanton would earn $1 million at the major league level with up to $3 million in incentives. The contract contained an invitation to spring training, and two opt-out clauses on April 1 and May 15. Blanton pitched on May 16 against the Yankees, pitching four innings of relief with one earned run in a 5‚Äì1 loss. On July 28, Blanton was designated for assignment to make room for Johnny Cueto. Despite the fact that he was traded before the Royals' World Series run that year, he still received a World Series ring, his second in his career. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On July 29, 2015, Blanton was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for cash considerations. Blanton appeared in 21 games, going 5‚Äì0 with a 1.57 ERA. He struck out 39 batters in innings pitched. =Second stint with Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 19, 2016, Blanton signed a one-year, $4 million contract to return to the Dodgers. He became the Dodgers primary setup man, appearing in 75 games with a 7‚Äì2 record and a 2.48 ERA in 80 innings. He pitched five scoreless innings in the 2016 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals but struggled in the 2016 National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, allowing seven earned runs in only three innings of work to be credited with the loss in two games. =Washington Nationals= On March 2, 2017, Blanton signed a one-year, $4 million contract with the Washington Nationals. He was put on the 10-day disabled list on May 17 with right shoulder inflammation and reactivated June 11. Both before and after his stint on the disabled list, Blanton struggled with a significant increase in his rate of home runs given up. He finished the 2017 season with a 2-4 record and a 5.68 ERA in innings across 51 appearances, all in relief. Blanton retired following the 2017 season.

It was sometimes called the Autonomous Oblast of Krajina, or the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK).ICTY - Radoslav Brdjanin verdict SAO Bosanska Krajina was located in the geographical region named Bosanska Krajina. Its capital was Banja Luka. The region was subsequently included into Republika Srpska. History The SAO Bosanska Krajina developed in summer and autumn of 1991 in preparation for a step to independence being taken by Bosnia like Slovenia and Croatia had done. The goal was to have areas where Serbs had a majority or a significant portion of population prevent such independence. The Serbs for this created three Serbian autonomous districts and one Serbian autonomous region (SAO Bosanska Krajina being the region). The SAO Bosanska Krajina was created from the Community (Association) of Bosanska Krajina Municipalities, with the exception that it did not include the region known as Cazinska Krajina or Prijedor municipality at first. Other similar situations were done in other Associations of Municipalities (or Community of Municipalities) in Bosnia, which were a type of government created under the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On or about 16 September 1991, the Association of Bosanska Krajina Municipalities was transformed into the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK), which came to include (amongst others) the following municipalities: Banja Luka, Bihaƒá-Ripaƒç, Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Gradi≈°ka, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Petrovac, ƒåelinac, Donji Vakuf, Kljuƒç, Kotor Varo≈°, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Sanski Most, ≈†ipovo and Tesliƒá. A separate Assembly of the Serbian People in Bosnia and Herzegovina was established on 24 October 1991, dominated by the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). On 9 January 1992, that Assembly adopted a declaration on the proclamation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The geographical area comprising the ARK thus became part of the proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unlike the other SAOs in Bosnia which were formed over summer and fall, the SAO Bosanska Krajina was officially formed on April 25, 1991, but under the name ARK (Autonomous Region of Krajina -- referring to Bosanska Krajina). There were attempts during the summer of 1991 to merge it with SAO Krajina. On September 12 its name was officially changed to SAO Bosanska Krajina.

He was victorious over the Sabines and was awarded a triumph which he celebrated on 4 April, 503 BC. According to Livy, he also led Roman troops against the Latin town of Pometia.Livy, Ab urbe condita, II. 16, 32, 33.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.Fasti Triumphales In some traditions he and his colleague also completed a census during their consulship.Broughton, vol i, pp.8. Jerome, Chronicon, ad ann. 504. According to Livy, Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession. Livy says that Menenius told the soldiers a fable about the parts of the human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body. The rest of the body thought the stomach was getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach. Soon, the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they were nothing without it. In the story, the stomach represents the patrician class and the other body parts represent the plebs. Eventually, Livy says, an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs, which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs.Livy, 2.33 It is not improbable that Saint Paul, an educated Roman citizen, knew this story (not necessarily through Livy) and was prompted by it in his use of the same parable when he admonished the Christians of Corinth that, for all their \\"diversity of gifts\\", they were all members of one body (I Cor. 12: 13 ff). However, the imagery was not new, even for Livy. It appears in Xenophon's Memorabilia (2.iii.18) and in Cicero's De Officiis (III.v.22). One puzzle about Menenius concerns his social status: Was he patrician or plebeian? Livy asserts that he was \\"an eloquent man and dear to the plebeians as being one of themselves by birth.\\" On the other hand, he was sent to the plebs as a representative of the Senate, and furthermore he had held the office of consul. The consulship, according to the traditional historiography, was at this time reserved strictly for patricians. Ancient accounts of early Roman history are compromised by uneven use of sources, the author's bias toward either senatorial or popular interests, and sheer uncertainty. The existence of the \\"plebeian\\" and \\"patrician\\" social division in the earliest period of Rome's history has been questioned by modern scholars.Survey by A. Drummond, \\"Rome in the fifth century II,\\" ch. 5, The Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. 7.2, The Rise of Rome. Menenius died in 493 BC. Livy records that during his life he had been beloved of both the senate and the plebs (particularly the latter since his involvement in ending their secession). As his estate lacked funds to pay for his funeral, the people contributed to his funeral expenses by way of a levy. Menenius had a son who would become consul in 439 BC.Walbank, F. W., A. E. Astin, M. W. Frederiksen, and R. M. Ogilvie. The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press 1990. . Menenius was also a character in William Shakespeare's Coriolanus.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Colorado Rockies, Baltimore Orioles, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Seattle Mariners. Byrnes retired from playing in 2010 and is now an analyst for MLB Network. Byrnes was considered a player who relied on his speed and hustle. He could hit for power, but tended to be a \\"free- swinger\\" and went through hitting droughts. Byrnes was ranked in the top-three for best defensive left fielders in John Dewan's publication, Fielding Bible. Byrnes was selected to the All-Time great Oakland A's 50th Season team in 2018. Amateur career =High school= Byrnes' high school career was spent in the West Catholic Athletic League, where he played for St. Francis High School in Mountain View, California. Byrnes regularly competed in baseball and football against Serra High School's Tom Brady, and Bellarmine College Prep's Pat Burrell. After graduating in 1994, he was selected in the 1994 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers but elected to go to college at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). =College= At UCLA (1995‚Äì98), Byrnes hit second in the batting order and played right field in a lineup that featured future major-league stars Troy Glaus (1995‚Äì97) and Garrett Atkins (1998). In 1995, Byrnes played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Chatham A's, and in 1996 and 1997 for the league's Hyannis Mets. He was again selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, this time by the Houston Astros after his junior season, but again elected to stay in school. Byrnes finished his UCLA career as one of the most successful hitters in Pac-10 history, with a .331 career average and 75 doubles ‚Äî a conference record. Byrnes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, in 2013. Professional career =Oakland Athletics= Byrnes was selected in the 8th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft by the Oakland Athletics. In the 1998 season, he played for the short-season Southern Oregon Timberjacks, and the Class-A Advanced Visalia Oaks in the A's organization where he batted a combined .357 with 19 doubles, 4 triples, 11 home runs, 52 runs batted in (RBI), and 17 stolen bases. In 1999, Byrnes continued to play in the A's minor leagues. That season, he played for the Class-A Advanced Modesto A's, and the Double-A Midland RockHounds and in 139 combined games, Byrnes batted .306 with 42 doubles, 1 triple, 7 home runs, 88 RBI, and 34 stolen bases. Byrnes made his major league debut on August 22, , against the Cleveland Indians. He went 2-for-4 with a stolen base in his first games, playing designated hitter, and batting seventh in the batting order. Byrnes batted .300 his first season, with three hits in ten at-bats. The next season, , Byrnes played 19 games with the A's. He hit his first home run of his major league career on June 9, 2001, against the San Francisco Giants. He batted .237 with one double, three home runs, five RBIs, and one stolen base with the A's in 2001. Byrnes played two games in the 2001 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, going hitless in two at-bats. Byrnes was also involved in a 2003 baseball game that included two significant base running gaffes in a single inning. With a chance to close out the Boston Red Sox, the Athletics had a potential rally stifled by two controversial plays. Byrnes was tagged out after failing to touch home plate after a collision with catcher Jason Varitek, who had blocked the plate before attempting to catch the ball. After the collision, a hobbling Byrnes shoved Varitek and began walking back to the dugout. Varitek picked up the ball and tagged Byrnes out. This play was then followed up by Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller running into Miguel Tejada as Byrnes was rounding third (later in the same inning). Tejada then stopped running home and was eventually tagged out; the umpires called Tejada out because he was tagged as a result of not attempting to advance home, not because of the obstruction by the third baseman. On June 29, 2003, Byrnes hit for the cycle. In 2004, Byrnes had his best year with the A's, batting .283 with 20 home runs and 73 RBI. =Colorado Rockies= On July 13, 2005, Byrnes, along with prospect Omar Quintanilla, was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitchers Joe Kennedy and Jay Witasick.

On August 15, 2005, Byrnes and the Orioles traveled to Oakland, marking the first time Byrnes played against his former team. After struggling against right-handed pitchers, the Orioles benched Byrnes and questioned his ability to be an every-day player. In 52 games with the Orioles that season, Byrnes batted .192 with 7 doubles, 1 triple, 3 home runs, 11 RBI, and 3 stolen bases. In his combined totals that season between the Oakland Athletics, the Colorado Rockies, and the Orioles, Byrnes batted .231 with 22 doubles, 3 triples, 10 home runs, 35 RBI, and 5 stolen bases in 111 games. =Arizona Diamondbacks= After the 2005 season, Byrnes was granted free agency.

In 2006, Byrnes batted .267 with 37 doubles, 3 triples, 26 home runs, 79 RBI, and 25 stolen bases. His 26 home runs led the Diamondbacks, as did his stolen bases, and his slugging percentage of .482. Midway through the 2007 season, Byrnes was rewarded with a three-year, $30 million contract extension with the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Swisher was acquired to be the Yankees starting first baseman. However, the Yankees signed Mark Teixeira later in the offseason, who took the starting role. At the end of spring training, manager Joe Girardi announced that Xavier Nady would be starting in right field while Swisher would be a bench player.w Due to the perceived logjam, many teams reportedly pursued Swisher, but the Yankees opted to keep him as a reserve outfielder and first baseman. On April 9, 2009, in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Swisher started for the first time as a Yankee in right field, replacing Xavier Nady who was playing DH to give Hideki Matsui a rest. Swisher went 3-for-5 with a home run and tying his career high of five RBIs. Just five days later, Swisher became the starting right fielder after Nady went on the disabled list due to an elbow injury.

Additionally, Swisher participated in the Home Run Derby.Home Run Derby a delight for Swisher , 07/12/10 Swisher finished the season with a career-high .288 batting average and 29 home runs. Although Swisher was usually hitting in the bottom third of the lineup, he was moved into the #2 slot in the lineup after Nick Johnson went down with an injury and served as a buffer for the middle of the Yankees lineup. In 2011, Swisher was moved down in the lineup to allow Curtis Granderson to hit second behind Derek Jeter and spent the majority of the season hitting sixth behind Robinson Can√≥. His fielding percentage ranked 2nd among all American League Right Fielders with a .996 behind Baltimore's Nick Markakis. Although Swisher's totals dipped a bit from his 2010 career year, he still managed to hit .260 and was one of four Yankees with at least 20 home runs (after Granderson, Teixeira, and Cano) and finished fourth on the team with 85 RBIs. On November 9, 2012, Swisher declined a $13.3 million one-year qualifying offer from the Yankees, making him a free agent. Under the new collective bargaining agreement, the Yankees received a compensatory pick because the Indians signed Swisher but it was not the Indians' pick. Cleveland, in turn, surrendered its highest pick outside of the top ten but that pick did not go to the Yankees, it was just skipped in the draft. Cleveland Indians in 2013 Cleveland Indians (2013-2015) On December 23, 2012, Swisher agreed to a four-year, $56 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. The contract reportedly included a fifth year vesting option worth $14 million, making the total contract worth $70 million. The deal became official on January 3, 2013. He soon called a section of the stadium Brohio. The Yankees received a compensation draft pick for the 2013 MLB draft as a result of losing Swisher, subsequently using it on Aaron Judge.

It is located at the end of False Creek and features many permanent interactive exhibits and displays, as well as areas with varying topics throughout the years. Prior to the building being handed over to Science World by the city government in 1987, the building was built as Expo Centre for the Expo 86 world's fair. Following the end of Expo 86, the building was re-purposed as a science centre. The science centre opened on May 6, 1989, as Science World.Science World History  Science World British Columbia.

History In 1977, Barbara Brink ran mobile hands-on exhibits known as the Extended I around the Lower Mainland. Later, the temporary Arts, Sciences & Technology Centre opened in downtown Vancouver on January 15, 1982, attracting over 600,000 visitors. Another 400,000 benefited from the centre's outreach programs, which were delivered around the province. When Vancouver was chosen to host the transportation-themed 1986 World's Fair (Expo 86), a Buckminster Fuller‚Äìinspired geodesic dome was designed by Expo's chief architect Bruno Freschi to serve as the fair's Expo Centre.\\"Our Iconic Facility\\", Science World webpage. Retrieved 2014-01-04 Construction began in 1984 and was completed by early 1985. After Expo closed its gates in October of the following year, an intensive lobbying campaign was launched to secure the landmark building, relocate the \\"Arts, Sciences and Technology Centre\\" into the post-Expo dome, and convert the Expo Centre into Science World. With much government backing, the dome was obtained from the province and a massive fund-raising campaign ensued. Donations from the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the GVRD, the private sector, foundations, and individuals contributed $19.1 million to build an addition to the Expo Centre, redesign the interior and fabricate exhibits. In 1988, in a four-month preview, over 310,000 visitors came to see the new building. A year later, the 400-seat Omnimax theatre in the upper section of the dome was opened, extending upon the 3D IMAX theatre which was built in 1986 for the Expo \\"Transitions\\" film series.Science World - OMNIMAX Theatre - OMNIMAX Facts The centre entered its first title sponsorship agreement with Alcan Inc. in 1996, renaming its Omnimax Theatre the Alcan Omnimax Theatre. Alcan later decided to sponsor the organization in different ways and the theatre returned to its original name, the Omnimax Theatre. Ken Spencer Science Park shortly after its opening in 2012 In January 2005, the building was officially renamed \\"Telusphere\\" as part of an agreement where Telus gave a $9-million donation in return for the naming rights to the building. This new name proved universally unpopular. In mid-2005, the name of the science centre was changed to \\"Science World at the Telus World of Science\\". The brand \\"Telus World of Science\\" was used for several other science centres in Calgary and Edmonton. The naming rights agreement ended in 2020, with the science centre dropping \\"Telus World of Science\\" from its name. During this period, the name change did not affect the nearby Main Street‚ÄìScience World SkyTrain station.

Bush in Charlotte, North Carolina A motorcade, or autocade, is a procession of vehicles.  Etymology  The term motorcade was coined by Lyle Abbot (in 1912 or 1913 when he was automobile editor of the Arizona Republican), and is formed after cavalcade on the false notion that \\"-cade\\" was a suffix meaning \\"procession\\". In fact, there is no such suffix in either French or Latin, although -cade has now since become a productive suffix in English, leading to the alternative names carcade, autocade, and even Hoovercade (after J. Edgar Hoover). Eric Partridge called the name a \\"monstrosity\\", and Lancelot Hogben considered the word to be a \\"counterfeit coinage\\". The original suffix in cavalcade is actually \\"-ade\\".  Uses of motorcades  = Funerals = A funeral cortege is a procession of mourners, most often in a motorcade of vehicles following a hearse. = Protests and demonstrations = Motorcades can be used as protests and demonstrations. A large, organised, group of vehicles will travel a busy route at very slow speed in order to deliberately cause traffic disruption. This is a tactic most often associated with protest groups that have access to many large vehicles, such as truckers and farmers. An example is the 2005 UK protests against fuel prices. As part of the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine in November 2013‚ÄîFebruary 2014, the sub-movement that made use of car processions as the means of protest was called the Automaidan. = VIPs = Motorcades can be used to transport a very important person, usually a political figure. Such a procession consists of several vehicles, usually accompanied by law enforcement support and additional protection to ensure the safety of the people in the motorcade. Motorcades for heads of government and heads of state can consist of dozens of vehicles, those being armoured cars, SUVs, and police motorcycles and cars leading the way and following. Traffic diversions Depending on the size of the motorcade and who it is carrying, routes may be completely blockaded from the general public. For security, this often occurs for motorcades for heads of state or government. President of the United States The motorcade for the President of the United States comprises forty to fifty vehicles; in addition to the president, the motorcade may carry his or her spouse, members of the press, security, White House officials, and VIP guests. The major members travel in armored vehicles, typically specially configured limousines. The motorcade contains several armored vehicles, a USSS Electronic Countermeasures Suburban, a counter-assault team, and Secret Service agents. When called for, a hazardous materials team precedes the motorcade on alert for potential hazards. A police presence precedes the beginning of the presidential motorcade. These cars and motorcycles usually drive ahead to clear the way and block traffic. The motorcade for the president is made up of two parts, the first being the \\"secure package\\". In the event of an emergency, the secure package separates from the rest of the group. It includes two limousines heavily guarded by local law enforcement and Secret Service, with all cars driven by professional drivers. The second part is made up of vans that transport White House staff members and selected members of the press. In the rear is the WHCA Roadrunner communications van ‚Äì which provides the primary communications path via satellite, allowing bi- directional voice, data and streaming video ‚Äì an ambulance, and additional police vehicles. Motorcade routes are selected by Secret Service agents in cooperation with local police forces. Escape routes are also established in the event of an emergency. President of South Korea The motorcade for the President of South Korea comprises twenty to thirty vehicles; in addition to the president, the motorcade may carry his or her spouse, members of the press, security, Blue House officials, VIP guests, family, friends and cabinet members. High ranking cabinet members travel in armored vehicles, typically specially configured limousines or armored Cadillac Escalades. The motorcade contains several armored vehicles of different car brands, there is a counter- assault team, Presidential Security Service agents, medical teams, police escorts from the Korean National Police Agency and other unknown unmarked vehicles. The police escort usually precedes the Presidential motorcade to clear the way, block traffic and shut down the streets for the motorcade. The motorcade is divided into two different parts, the first half being the part of the motorcade carrying the president and his or her spouse the second half carrying Blue House staff, more security and the press. Many people most notably saw the Korean presidential motorcade during the first Inter-Korean summit at the DMZ on the Korean border, where the leaders of the two Koreas met for the first time. https://fox6now.com/2018/04/26/kim-jong-un-walks- south-to-meet-his-rival-can-they-deal/ The routes for the motorcade are selected by the Presidential Security Service agents with cooperation with local police forces. There is always an emergency route set in case of any emergencies before the President goes anywhere.

Early career During and after studying sociology at Shiraz University and University of Tehran, but before starting his political career in Tehran, Nabavi also worked as a school teacher, and taught philosophy in the Jihad for Construction (ÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤ŸÜÿØ⁄Ø€å) effort. Nabavi started his political career working for the Iranian dalahoo in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Ministry of Interior (personally invited by Ali Akbar Nategh- Nouri), and the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (personally invited by Mohammad Hashemi). His posts include the Manager of the Political Office of the Ministry of Interior in 1361‚Äì1364 AP (ca. 1982‚Äì1985 CE). According to himself, he was chosen because of his wide political knowledge about the Iranian political issues, because of his past activities with the Office for Strengthening Unity and the Organization of Muslim Students of Shiraz University, where he had worked with Ata'ollah Mohajerani, Jamileh Kadivar, and Mostafa Moeen. Satire and journalism career Nabavi started his satire career in the Soroush magazine in serial articles on cinema titled \\"andar hekƒÅyat-e re≈°te va sar-r derƒÅz va ‚Ä¶\\" and continued it in the Gozaresh-e Film magazine (which he co-founded and worked as the magazine's first editor) with \\"rƒÅport-hƒÅ\\" (reports). After leaving Gozaresh-e Film, Nabavi helped Kioumars Saberi Foumani start the Gol-Agha magazine, where he later wrote for. While working at Gol-Agha, Nabavi started writing also for the Hamshahri monthly magazine, where he suggested establishing the Hamshahri daily newspaper, which later became very popular.

During his MLB career, spanning from 1995 through 2008, he played for the Boston Red Sox, Oakland Athletics, and Cincinnati Reds. Before his major league career, Hatteberg attended Washington State University, where he played college baseball for the Cougars.  Early life  Hatteberg was born in Salem, Oregon. He played Little League in his native Salem, Oregon and Canby, Oregon, and Pony League and American Legion baseball in Yakima, Washington. Hatteberg graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima in 1988. He was MVP of the baseball team and also lettered in football. He was team captain his senior year and hit .570 with seven home runs.  College career  He attended Washington State University from 1989 through 1991 for the Washington State Cougars baseball team in the Pacific-10 Conference. The Cougars won the Pac-10 North all three years. He was captain and MVP in 1991 and as a catcher he formed a battery with future major league pitcher Aaron Sele. Hatteberg played collegiate summer baseball in the Alaska Baseball League in 1989 and 1990. At Washington State, he was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. Alpha Gamma Rho seasonal magazine. International career He was a member of the United States national baseball team at the 1990 Goodwill Games. He hit a home run in a game against the Mexican national baseball team. He hit .292/.346/.417 for Team USA in the 1990 Baseball World Cup. Professional career  = Boston Red Sox = He was the third player selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 1991 June draft, a sandwich pick between the first and second rounds as compensation from Kansas City Royals for the signing of Type A free agent Mike Boddicker. Hatteberg debuted with the Red Sox in 1995. In parts of seven seasons from 1995 through 2001, he hit 34 home runs and batted .267. On August 6, 2001, against the Texas Rangers, he became the only player in MLB history to hit into a triple play and hit a grand slam in his next at-bat. The bat he used for that game is now in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In Hatteberg's last season with the Red Sox, he ruptured a nerve in his elbow. After surgery, he was forced to relearn how to throw and hold a baseball, endangering his career as a catcher. NPR Interview with Moneyball author, Michael Lewis. On December 19 he was traded to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for Pokey Reese. Two days later, Colorado declined to offer Hatteberg arbitration and he became a free agent. =Oakland Athletics= The Oakland Athletics signed Hatteberg to under a one-year contract with a $950,000 base salary plus incentives, the day after the Rockies declined to offer salary arbitration. Due to his difficulty throwing resulting from the elbow injury, he was asked to play first base. Hatteberg's conversion from catcher to first baseman by the Athletics is the subject of a chapter in the Michael Lewis book Moneyball. In that chapter, Oakland General Manager Billy Beane openly admitted how the team had pursued Hatteberg because of his high on-base percentage, which Athletics' management had determined was most often correlated with runs scored. According to Beane, it was one of the most affordable skills at that time for small-market clubs like the A's. Infield coach Ron Washington worked with Hatteberg to teach him the new position. A fictionalized version of Hatteberg (played by Chris Pratt) is a key character in the 2011 film Moneyball. A career highlight for Hatteberg was as a member of the Oakland A's on September 4, 2002. The A's had won 19 straight games to tie the American League record. With their next game, against the Kansas City Royals, tied at 11 after the A's had blown an 11-0 lead, Hatteberg pinch-hit with one out and the bases empty in the bottom of the ninth inning. He drove a 1-0 pitch well over the right center field wall off Jason Grimsley for a walk-off home run to give the A's a 12-11 win and a then-American League record 20-game winning streak, which has since been broken by the 2017 Cleveland Indians who won 22 straight games (the overall Major League record; the 1916 New York Giants had won 26 straight games with an interspersed tie for a record 27-game unbeaten streak). This moment is depicted in the Moneyball film. As an everyday player Hatteberg helped the Athletics reach the playoffs twice, in 2002 and 2003. He hit 49 home runs and batted .269 from 2002 through 2005. He drove in 263 runs and had an on base percentage of .355. His best year was 2004 when he hit .287, scored 87 runs, hit 15 home runs, drove in 82 runs, and had an on-base percentage of .367.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hattesc01.shtml = Cincinnati Reds = Bill Hall during a July 2006 game in Milwaukee On February 12, 2006, the Cincinnati Reds signed Hatteberg to a one-year, $750,000 contract. He was originally expected to give them flexibility at first base, backing up Adam Dunn. When the Reds traded Wily Mo Pe√±a to the Red Sox, Dunn moved back to the outfield and Hatteberg was to play at first base, improving the Reds' defense. On August 8, 2006, he recorded his 1,000th career hit against Jason Marquis of the St. Louis Cardinals at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. He went 3-for-5 in this game, increasing his batting average to .323. During the first weeks of the 2008 season, he was relegated to pinch-hitting while rookie Joey Votto replaced him at first base. Pinch- hitting was relatively new to Hatteberg, who admitted that it was a role he was not particularly comfortable in even though he had hit his historic September 4, 2002 20-game winning-streak clinching walk-off homer for Oakland as a pinch-hitter. On May 27, 2008, he was designated for assignment by the Reds to make room on the roster for top prospect Jay Bruce and officially released by the club on June 4. =Career statistics= In 1314 games over 14 seasons, Hatteberg posted a .273 batting average (1153-for-4226) with 538 runs, 249 doubles, 7 triples, 106 home runs, 527 RBI, 562 bases on balls, .361 on-base percentage and .410 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .992 fielding percentage playing at first base and catcher. In 17 postseason games, he hit .286 (12-for-42) with 9 runs, 2 doubles, 1 home run and 11 walks. =After retirement= Hatteberg serves as a Special Assistant to Baseball Operations for the Oakland Athletics. In the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Hatteberg substituted for Ray Fosse as the Oakland A's color commentator on TV broadcasts for a number of games. Personal life He and his wife Elizabeth, nicknamed \\"Bitsy,\\" have three children, Lauren, Sophia, and Ella. They reside in Gig Harbor, Washington. He is a self-taught guitar player and avid fly fisherman.

The station was owned by Eagle Creek Broadcasting. On July 1, 2015, Gray Television, owner of NBC affiliate KGNS-TV, bought the non-license assets of KVTV and established KYLX- LP, to which it moved all of KVTV's program streams. KVTV then ceased broadcasting after nearly 42 years. The KVTV full-power license was surrendered on September 19, 2016. History One of several stations serving the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo borderplex, KVTV began in 1973 as a satellite station of KZTV, the CBS affiliate in Corpus Christi, Texas owned by K-Six Television. Both stations were run on tight budgets, which meant that the lack of investment in the station's operations sometimes showed up on-air. In 2002, Alta Communications and Brian Brady acquired K-Six Television, renaming the company Eagle Creek Broadcasting of Texas. KVTV operated newscasts during the 1980s and early 2000s under the name Newswatch 13. At the peak of their news operations KVTV produced three daily :30 minute newscasts at noon, 6 p.m., and 10 p.m. After making significant strides in the Nielsen ratings against then powerhouse KGNS' Pro 8 News in the mid 1990s, KVTV management decided in 1996 to move the 6 p.m. newscast to 6:30 to make way for the new entertainment show Access Hollywood. Many KVTV alumni working at that time believe that decision proved to be the start of the demise of Newswatch 13. Soon after the new owners took over they made significant changes to KVTV. All newscasts the station produced were dropped, except for the noon show, which was said to help reduce the strain put upon the news and production departments. Later that year, the station made cosmetic and personnel changes on almost every level and renamed their operations CBS 13 News. The midday newscast was retained for a year and a half and later dropped. Late night news was revived on the station on April 19, 2004 with CBS 13 News: Nightcast, a similar title to its Corpus Christi sister. For this, former KGNS anchorman Richard Noriega was hired out of semi-retirement to lead the newscast. Several months prior to the newscast, Noriega worked as a consultant and helped with the planning involved in revamping the station's news department. Nightcast was the station's only local newscast, and was seen weekdays from 10-10:35 p.m. Prior to this program, a taped five-minute news bulletin called NewsNight aired. The station decided to cancel the late newscast on January 3, 2006 and laid off the remaining staff of the news department that day. The move left KVTV as one of the few CBS affiliates to not have a local newscast; in its last decade on the air, the only news programming on the station came from CBS News, including the CBS Evening News, CBS Morning News, and CBS This Morning with national weather and additional news updates given by a CBS News anchor during the :25 and :55 local news breaks. From 2006 until the end of broadcasting in 2015, the station largely served as a pass-through for automated network, syndicated and local paid commercial programming in both English and Spanish. On July 23, 2008, Eagle Creek Broadcasting sold KVTV's Corpus Christi sister station, KZTV, to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. KVTV was not included in that deal, as SagamoreHill already owned KGNS-TV; thus, KVTV became the only television station remaining in the Eagle Creek group, though co-owner Brian Brady also owns a number of other television stations, mostly through Northwest Broadcasting. Due to a part failure on its analog transmitter, KVTV ceased broadcasting in analog on November 29, 2008. The station initially broadcast only on digital channel 31, tuned into channel 13 via PSIP. Digital broadcasts shifted to channel 13 on May 7, 2009.Notification of Suspension of Operations / Request for Silent STA for channel 13 Gray Television, which over a year prior had purchased KGNS-TV from SagamoreHill, bought the non-license assets of KVTV in 2015. The sale closed on July 1, at which time KVTV signed off and KYLX-LP began broadcasting (inheriting its CBS affiliation from KVTV) with KVTV going off the air on that day. The KVTV license was surrendered by Eagle Creek on September 19, 2016.Surrender of KVTV License Digital services On December 7, 2011, KVTV began broadcasting CBS programming in HD on channel 13.1, and carried standard definition CBS programming on sub- channel 13.2. { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\\" Channel Call Sign Network Video Dimensions Aspect Ratio Video Bitrate Audio Bitrate - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\\"  13.1  KVTV-DT  CBS-HD  1080i  1920x1080  16:9  15Mbit/s  DD2.0  192kbit/s - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\\"  13.2  KVTV-DT2  CBS-SD  480i  704x480  4:3  2.85Mbit/s  DD2.0  192kbit/s } References External links * Category:Defunct terrestrial television stations in the United States Category:Television channels and stations established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Texas Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2016 Category:2016 disestablishments in Texas VTV Category:Defunct mass media in Texas ","title":"KVTV"},{"id":"2141238","text":"Philip Timothy Howard (born March 7, 1961) is the former director of the College of Professional Studies' Doctorate Program in Law & Policy at Northeastern University.

Background Varg Vikernes recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993 at the Grieg Hall in Bergen. However, the releases were spread out, with many months between the recording and the release of each album. During this time, Vikernes became a part of the early Norwegian black metal scene and befriended Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. The two developed a feud that culminated in Vikernes stabbing Euronymous to death in his apartment building in Oslo in August 1993. He was arrested a few days later and, in May 1994, was sentenced to 21 years (the maximum sentence in Norway) in prison for murder and several church arsons. The album cover features a drawing by 19th century artist Theodor Kittelsen named Fattigmannen (The Pauper).

Children with orthopaedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and cleft lip and palate are eligible for care and receive all services in a family-centered environment, regardless of the patients' ability to pay. Care for children is usually provided until age 18, although, in some cases it may be extended to age 21. Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, the hospitals are owned and operated by Shriners International, formerly known as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, a Freemasonry-related organization whose members are known as Shriners. Patients are not required to have any familial affiliation with the Shriners order nor Freemasonry. The current advertising campaign for the healthcare system features the tagline, \\"Love to the Rescue.\\" History Shreveport, Louisiana In 1920, the Imperial Session of the Shriners was held in Portland, Oregon. During that session the membership unanimously passed a resolution to establish what at the time was called the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children system. The first hospital in the system opened in 1922 in Shreveport, Louisiana. It provided pediatric orthopaedic care. Shriners Hospitals for Children worked closely with the United States Southern Command and other military commands, including the Army and Air Force, the Guatemalan combined military force and via the U.S. embassy, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and the U.S. State Department to arrange medical visas and transportation to the United States, \\"with a global commitment to children around the world\\". In 1962, the Shriners of North America allocated $10 million to establish three hospitals that specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of burned children. After visiting 21 university-based medical institutions, the decision was made to build their first pediatric burn hospital on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that the Shriners Hospitals were ranked as the 9th \\"most popular charity/non-profit in America\\" of over 100 charities researched with 40% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \\"Love\\" and \\"Like A Lot\\" for the Shriners Hospitals.The Charities Americans Like Most And Least, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, December 13, 1996 And USA Today, December 20, 1994, \\"Charity begins with health\\", FINAL 01D In September 2008, the Shriner's Hospital in Galveston sustained significant damage from Hurricane Ike. The hospital was closed for renovation at that time, and care for children with acute burns was provided at other Shriners Hospitals for Children. The Shriners had considered closing facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana; Greenville, South Carolina; Erie, Pennsylvania; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Massachusetts and Galveston, Texas, eliminating a total of 225 beds. However, in July 2009, the Shriners National Convention voted overwhelming against closing any hospitals and to repair and reopen the Galveston facility. In 2009, despite an endowment that declined from $8 billion to $5 billion in less than a year because of the poor economy, Douglas Maxwell, the hospitals' CEO said he and other Shriners are confident the hospital system will be able to remain solvent in the long term.Roberts, M. (2009). The Gaea Times :Shriners to keep serving 22 cities, but may downgrade some hospitals; will accept insurance Accessed 11 Jan, 2014 Maxwell stated in July 2009 that some of the facilities may become outpatient surgical centers, and will begin accepting insurance payments (for most care) for the first time in the hospitals' 87-year history. Maxwell said children suffering from burns, orthopaedic conditions, spinal cord injuries and cleft palates will continue to be treated without charge to their families.Roberts, M. (2009). Accessed 1-11-2014 In May 2015, Shriners Hospitals for Children became a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, a national network of organizations committed to better serving patients and their families through physician collaboration. Treatments The Shriner's Burns hospital on the Campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas Treatment areas cover a wide range of pediatric orthopaedics, including scoliosis, limb discrepancies, clubfoot, hip dysplasia, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, as well as cerebral palsy, spina bifida (myelomeningocele), and other neurological conditions that affect ambulation and movement. Three of the hospitals provide spinal cord injury rehabilitation that is developmentally appropriate for children and adolescents, with adventure and adapted sports programs, activity-based rehabilitation, aquatherapy, animal-assisted therapy, and other programs. Four of the hospitals (Boston, Galveston, Cincinnati, and Sacramento) provide care for children with burns, as well as treating a variety of skin conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The Boston, Chicago, Shreveport, and Portland hospitals also provide treatment for children with craniofacial conditions, especially facial clefts. The hospital in Sacramento is the only hospital in the Shriners' system that focuses on all three areas of treatment (burns, orthopaedics, and spinal cord injuries), as well as research. The Sacramento hospital also houses its own orthotics and prosthetics lab and development facilities. Transportation to the hospitals is often provided free of charge for patients and their family by Shriner-drivers (also known as Hospital Tripsters) across the country, by van or by airplane. Children accepted for treatment become part of the Shriners Hospital system until their 18th or, sometimes, their 21st, birthday, eligible for both inpatient and outpatient treatment for all facets of their disability. While the main emphasis of the hospitals is to provide medical care to children regardless of the family's ability to pay, the mission of the hospitals also includes research on the conditions treated and the education of medical professionals, including medical residents and fellows, nurses, physical, recreation, and occupational therapists, speech and language pathology, psychologists, social workers, and child life specialists.

He played most of his ten seasons in Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball as a first baseman and pitcher, but has never held a Major League starting job for an entire season. He is perhaps best known for hitting a dramatic two-out, two-strike home run for the Tampa Bay Rays in the bottom of the ninth inning of the last game of the 2011 season, also known as Wild Card Wednesday. That home run tied the game, which the Rays eventually won, sending them to the playoffs. His clutch hitting for the Rays, along with his red hair and beard, earned him the nickname \\"The Great Pumpkin\\". Also within his extensive Minor League Baseball career that began in 2001, Johnson has won a Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in two different Triple-A leagues. He won the Pacific Coast League MVP in 2004 and the International League MVP in 2010. In 2016, Johnson signed with the Rays organization, entering spring training as a knuckleball pitcher. High school and college Johnson graduated from Blaine High School, in Blaine, Minnesota in 1997. He then attended Butler University for his freshman year, when he was named All-Conference in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. He transferred to a junior college, and finally ended up at the University of Nebraska, where he helped the Cornhuskers make a College World Series appearance, and earned All-American honors.

After changes in 2009, Bashas' employs approximately 8,500 people. Most Bashas' stores are non-union. Nine stores that Bashas' acquired from previous chains continue to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, which campaigns against the chain.

History Najeeb Basha immigrated to the United States from Lebanon in 1886; he and his wife Najeeby moved to Arizona in 1910. The family struggled for years in retail sales in the Arizona mining towns of Ray and Sonora, facing numerous setbacks, but remained determined to succeed. The first store to officially incorporate the Bashas' name opened in 1932 in Goodyear, Arizona, as a company store. Employees of J. G. Boswell could purchase groceries with company scrip. Bashas' was founded by Najeeb and Najeeby's sons, Ike Basha and Eddie Basha, Sr. On July 12, 2009, Bashas' filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, citing the weak economy, increased competition, and their ongoing legal fight with the UFCW union. In doing so, the company planned to close ten under-performing Bashas' and Food City stores. The company emerged from bankruptcy in late 2010. The Chapter 11 plan provided for payment in full of all creditors. Upon the death of Eddie Sr., leadership was taken over by Eddie Basha, Jr..

The museum's main building is located on a portion of the Eli Whitney Gun Factory site, a gun factory erected by Eli Whitney in 1798. The museum focuses on teaching experiments that are the roots of design and invention, featuring hands-on building projects and exhibits on Whitney and A. C. Gilbert.Eli Whitney Museum Site history The museum is located on grounds that were originally developed by Eli Whitney to produce muskets on a site he purchased on September 17, 1798. The factory was powered by water from the Mill River and produced muskets for the United States government. On June 14, 1798, he contracted to produce 10,000 muskets to be delivered within 28 months at the cost of $134,000.00; in fact, it took ten years. When he signed the contract, Whitney had no factory, no workers and no experience in gun manufacturing. However, in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, a fellow Yale University graduate and friend, Whitney had written: :I am persuaded that Machinery moved by water adapted to this Business would greatly diminish the labor and facilitate the manufacture of this Article. Machines for forging, rolling, floating, boring, grinding, polishing, etc. may all be made use of to advantage.... (May 13, 1798) Whitney's factory was at the very forefront of the American Industrial Revolution, using water-powered machinery, and it was among the first to have standardized, interchangeable parts (for some but not all of its parts). The area around the museum was once known as Whitneyville, the manufacturing village constructed along the Mill River to house the workers at the Whitney Armory, and made famous by painter William Giles Munson, who sketched the Armory in 1826, a year after Whitney died, creating at least 3 paintings from those sketches over the next two decades. The grounds, which span both sides of Whitney Avenue and cross the Mill River, still feature the old barn, stone coal shed and boarding house which date back to the days of Whitneyville and the operational armory, along with a reconstruction of Ithiel Town's innovative lattice truss covered bridge erected on the original pilings of one of the two bridges built to service the Eli Whitney Armory. Elizabeth Mills Brown, New Haven, a guide to architecture and urban design, accessed October 15, 2012 The museum occupies a portion of the site, between Whitney Avenue and the Mill River, occupying a brick factory building built on the site in 1890. The barn and boarding house, located west of Whitney Avenue, are occupied by other nonprofit organizations. Museum exhibits and activities A popular exhibit is the museum's yearly holiday installation of model trains. The Eli Whitney museum has exhibits on Whitney and his most famous invention, the cotton gin. Other exhibits cover the historic site and A. C. Gilbert, the inventor and toy maker best known for his invention of the erector set. The museum is an experimental learning workshop for design and specializes in building projects for children blending science and invention. The site is located adjacent to the dam first built by Eli Whitney to power the armory, then raised to its current height by Eli Whitney Blake to provide more power. The museum also features water tables with canal locks and is adjacent to a water reservoir as well as hiking trails. In addition to visitor hours, the museum hosts summer and holiday programs and birthday parties, and is home to the annual Leonardo Challenge, a celebration of improvisational creativity that invites artists and designers from the New Haven, Connecticut area to create uncommon inventions and designs from common objects, culminating in an exhibition of their creative efforts. Apprenticeship Program In addition to day and weeklong education programs, the Museum supports about 60 apprentices at a time for longer-term, paid, hands-on experience. Apprentices age between 13 and 18, and generally work 200 hours through the school year, and 400 hours in the summer. They learn design, fabrication, and teaching skills, which they put to work developing and teaching exhibitions and projects. Apprenticeship alumni include Jennifer Oxley (Emmy Award-winning children's TV creator), Emily Oster (Economist), and Joshua Revkin (Star World Champion sailor).

The spot is believed to be the site where Magellan was killed in the 1521 Battle of Mactan. History A scene of the Battle of Mactan painted in the shrine The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was commanding a Spanish fleet when he first came to the southern Philippines on the small island of Limasawa on 7 April 1521. He was the first European to set foot in the Philippines. Due to inadequate food supplies, he was forced to land at Cebu. Landing in Cebu with a show of heavy arms, he refused to pay any fee for entering the port. He even threatened Raja Humabon, the local ruler, and boasted about his victories in Malaca and Calicut. He then offered them gifts and befriended them. The Rajah, who welcomed Magellan to the island, wanted to hold a casi casi, a blood-brother ceremony. Magellan then started converting the native people to Christianity. He converted 800 people of the barangay (villages). Before conversion, the natives worshipped their own main god whom they addressed as Bathala, along with other subordinate gods. The natives who lived in small barangays were controlled by local chieftains called Rajas. During the baptisms, Magellan planted a cross at the site. The natives accepted the Catholic belief that \\"there is only one God\\". Magellan was able to convert most of the powerful leaders of the islands, except one leader called Lapu-Lapu. During his stay in Cebu, Magellan found out that some of the local inhabitants had refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of the King of Spain, and as a warning to the villagers, he burned a few villages. However, in spite of this warning, Lapu- Lapu opposed the control of Spain over the islands. Magellan launched a naval war against Lapu-Lapu with an armada of three boats carrying Spanish soldiers and 20 boats carrying Cebuanos. In this battle, which took place on 27 April 1521, Lapu-Lapu fought valiantly with his men, armed with wooden shields, bows and arrows, and lances. Magellan and his army of Spanish soldiers and Cebuanos could not withstand the attack and were forced to retreat to their boats. Magellan was fatally wounded in the battle. He was hit on the leg by a poisoned arrow and also attacked with spears and other weapons. A spear had also struck his head. Magellan's body was demanded by the Spaniards, but Lapu- Lapu refused them this favor. A stone platform here has a plaque with the date 27 April 1521, the date Magellan was killed in the battle. Adjoining the shrine is a statue of Lapu-Lapu, who is hailed as first Filipino hero. Festival A festival called the Kadaugan sa Mactan (Victory at Mactan), commemorating the triumph of the native chieftain Lapu-Lapu over Magellan, is held on 27 April every year. On this occasion, colorful events include a ceremonial procession of \\"decorated bancas\\" (canoes) representing Magellan's three boats on the sea coast of the beach of Barangay, erecting the cross of Magellan on the island, conversion of the local people to Christianity by baptism, and scenes of the recreation of the battle.

The tunnel was part of the construction of the underground Circle line, near Nicoll Highway station. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a deep cave-in that spread across six lanes of Nicoll Highway. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident delayed the construction end date for the MRT station. Causes Investigations and probes into the collapse commenced immediately. It eventually was found that the most apparent cause of the collapse was that the retaining wall could not handle the stress of holding up the tunnel, forcing it to give way. This occurred near the Nicoll Highway MRT station under construction along the Circle line and near the Merdeka Bridge. Consequences of the collapse The accident left a collapse zone 150 m wide, 100 m long, and 30 m deep (). Four workers were killed, with three more injured. Steel beams were twisted, with two construction cranes being swallowed up. A substantial chunk of the main highway running over the tunnel was also knocked out. The rescue efforts were called off on 23rd of that month because of the low chance of survival by that point, as well as danger to the rescue teams. There was also the increasing need to stabilize the ground around the accident site to reduce the risk of further collapses. All six lanes of the Nicoll Highway were heavily damaged, rendering the road unusable. The highway re- opened on 4 December that year after reconstruction efforts. A committee of inquiry found the main contractor Nishimatsu Construction Company (:ja:Ë•øÊùæÂª∫Ë®≠) and its officers as well as Land Transport Authority officers responsible for the collapse. Several other officers and subcontractors were reprimanded and issued warnings in connection with the accident. As a result of the accident, Stages 1 and 2 of the Circle line were delayed. Stage 3 of the line, Bartley to Marymount stations opened first on 28 May 2009. The partially built station structure was abandoned, and the affected station has been shifted about away from the accident site. Eventually, Nicoll Highway station started operations on 17 April 2010. =The victims= * Vadivil s/o Nadeson, crane operator A Malaysian of Indian descent, his body was the first to be recovered. The 44-year-old had reportedly tried to escape by jumping out from his crane when the incident occurred. He was found caught between a pick-up truck and a container. * Liu Rong Quan (), construction worker The body of the 36-year-old Chinese national from Jiangsu province was found wedged between the wheel and chassis of a truck. Liu had started working at the site just ten days before the incident. He left behind a wife and daughter. * John Tan Lock Yong (), Land Transport Authority engineer The third victim to be found, Tan was due to finish his contract with LTA at the end of 2004 and had planned to migrate to Australia or New Zealand then. He leaves behind his wife, a grown-up daughter and a son. * Heng Yeow Pheow (), foreman The body of the 40-year-old Singaporean was never recovered. According to survivor accounts, Heng had selflessly hurried his workers to safety but himself was trapped when the collapse occurred. Heng left behind his wife, two young children, his 70-year- old mother and nine siblings. Criminal trials Four men faced criminal charges in the wake of the Nicoll Highway collapse. The first man put on trial was Ng Seng Yoong who was a project director of the Circle MRT line and also monitored the excavation and design work in his other capacity as the Qualified Person on the site. He faced one charge of breaching conditions under the Building Control Act. Arguments were made that readings of instruments on site have indicated that things were not going as planned, but the warnings were not acted upon. On 24 November 2005, Ng was fined $8,000 (SGD) by the court.

The character appeared in the award-winning series Runaways. Like the original Runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent; his is the classic Avengers villain Ultron, an evil robot bent on world domination. Victor, however, is a cyborg, with human flesh and natural tissue cloned from his human mother which completely conceals his metal parts and circuitry. Publication history Victor Mancha was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in Runaways vol. 2, #1 (April 2005). Fictional character biography When Ultron encountered a woman named Marianella Mancha who is unable to have a child due to a drug that was put in her, Ultron took some of her DNA and cloned it while combining some of his advanced nano-technology to create for her a son named Victor Mancha. The Runaways first heard of Victor Mancha as a boy who would grow up to become the villain \\"Victorious\\", a man who would rule the world after dismantling the Avengers. Due to his prophesied betrayal, Victor was kept under close surveillance when he first joined the team, but has since been accepted as a full-fledged member. He is the team's only Latino member and one of two members who can pilot the Leapfrog, the Runaways' mode of transportation. =True Believers= Victor is first introduced as the son of Mexican single mother Marianella Mancha, supposed widow of a United States Marine Corps member who was killed in action. When an older version of Gertrude Yorkes arrives in the present, she informs the Runaways of a villain in her time named \\"Victorious\\", and how they must stop him right now while he is still a teen. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish. After the Runaways track Victor down at his school, the sight of Karolina Dean activates Victor's electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor's powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina. Remembering how future-Gert mentioned that Victorious's father was the \\"greatest evil in all the universe\\", the Runaways sift through possibilities such as Magneto, Electro, Kingpin, Red Skull, Leader, and Galactus. Although Doctor Doom calls Victor proclaiming he is his father, it turns out that it is merely a Doombot created by Ultron. Victor discovers that his actual \\"father\\" is Ultron who created Victor as a sleeper agent for the Avengers. Victor was meant to grow up, travel to New York and meet the Avengers. After years of loyal service, he would have access to their most guarded secrets, and then Ultron would have taken over and destroyed every hero on the planet. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true. Ultron kills Marianella and overrides Victor's circuits, forcing him to attack the Runaways. With help from Excelsior, the Runaways and Victor defeat Ultron, but they take Victor in after realizing that Victor is in the same boat as they are. =Runaways= Over the next few months, Victor proves himself to the team, particularly to Chase Stein, in battle to make up for his alternate future self. He falls out of grace for a short while after Nico Minoru discovers that the second Pride has tapped into Victor's circuits and was using him to spy on the team. After the Runaways' fight with the new Pride, Victor begins a physical relationship with Nico; he confesses to have initiated it because he harbors romantic feelings for her, but Nico claims to have participated as a way to escape her survivor's guilt regarding the death of Gertrude Yorkes. However, Victor still attempts a rescue when he discovers Chase has Nico hostage, but is easily shut down when Chase asks him a rhetorical question designed to overload Victor's circuits. Victor recovers with help from Molly Hayes (vicariously by Alex Wilder) and saves Nico from becoming an innocent sacrifice to the Gibborim. At this point, Victor and Nico begin a romantic relationship, but their moment of bliss is interrupted when the team is forced to run from Iron Man and the pro-registration forces of Marvel's Civil War.Runaways (vol.2) #24 =Civil War= During a S.H.I.E.L.D. operation to capture the Runaways, Victor uses his powers to shield the Leapfrog from a barrage of missiles. The second wave of missiles are coated with Teflon, so they are unaffected by Victor's magnetic powers and hit him. He suffers grievous damage and the team returns with him to the Hostel. Victor then experiences intense seizures when the Vision arrives with the Young Avengers.Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways #1 Although the Runaways are initially mistrustful of the Young Avengers, Stature is able to pull the Vision away from Victor. The Vision explains that he and Victor were experiencing a form of feedback caused by their shared programming because both of them were created by Ultron.Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways #4 Nico and Victor also initiate a relationship. Victor's assortment of humorous nicknames is a sort of running gag in the series' second volume, with such names as \\"Static Cling Lad\\", \\"Mr. Roboto\\", \\"Victron\\", \\"Calculator Kid\\", \\"Se√±or Cyborg\\", \\"Man of La Mancha\\", \\"RoboPinocchio\\", and Magnet Man.\\" =Dead-End Kids= After escaping Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D., Nico makes a decision to make a deal with the Kingpin, which disgusts Victor. In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York. It is during this period where Victor meets Lillie \\"the Spieler\\" McGurty, a girl who can fly to the sound of music. While separated from Nico, Victor bonds with Lillie's carefree spirit. A short time later, he has a dream of kissing Lillie. Nico, understanding her relationship with Victor is deteriorating, backs off and allows Victor to initiate a relationship with Lillie, who agrees to return to the present with the Runaways. Right before the Runaways board the time machine that takes them home, Lillie changes her mind and decides to stay instead, due to fear of jumping into the future. Klara Prast takes her place instead, arriving with the Runaways in the present. Although the Runaways do not know, Lillie is still alive, regretting her decision. The Runaways come under attack when a group of Majesdaneans arrive on Earth to capture Karolina.Runaways: Vol. 3, #2 In the end, the team is overpowered, but Xavin shapeshifts into Karolina's form and takes her place as a prisoner of the Majesdaneans.Runaways: Vol. 3, #5 =Avengers A.I.= Following the Age of Ultron storyline, Victor Mancha joins up with Henry Pym's Avengers A.I. alongside Monica Chang, Vision (his older \\"brother\\"), and a reprogrammed Doombot.Avengers A.I. #1 During one mission he sacrifices himself to save a server containing an A.I. civilization.Avengers A.I. #4 The team later discovers he is alive inside a server called The Diamond when he sends Morse code to Pym that says \\"Fruit Loops\\", a cereal he hates, which Pym interprets as he is still alive.Avengers A.I. #6 Victor finds allies against the rogue A.I.Avengers A.I. #8 He and the Avengers are saved when Monica Chang cuts off the virus by preventing the execution of a rogue LMD.Avengers A.I. #12 =Vision= Some time later, Victor moves in with Vision after getting an internship in Washington, D.C. It is later revealed that Victor is actually acting as an undercover agent for the Avengers, with orders to spy on Vision and his family due to their increasingly erratic behavior.Vision #8 It is revealed via flashbacks that during his time with the Runaways, Victor had secretly developed an addiction to Vibranium, which for him acts similar to narcotics used by humans. After using the Vibranium in a special piano given to Vision by Black Panther, Victor misjudges the strength of his powers and accidentally kills Vision's son, Vin.Vision #9 Captain America arrests him, but Vision defeats the Avengers to reach his cell. Vision is unable to kill Victor, but Victor's cybernetic heart is ripped out of his body by Vision's wife Virginia‚Äîkilling him. With his final thoughts, he is at peace, knowing that he \\"will never be Victorious.\\"Vision #11 =Becoming Victorious= When Chase Stein attempts to revive Victor's head, the \\"Victorious\\" program begins.Runaways Vol. 4 #3 It is revealed that Victor is conscious when Chase Stein, Nico Minoru, Gertrude Yorkes, and Old Lace visit Molly Hayes to see if she is interested in reforming the Runaways again. During this visit, Molly is the only one to figure out that he is conscious, and is happy that Victor is still alive in a sense. Victor asks Molly to keep this a secret as he figures out whether or not he wants to rejoin Chase and the others. But unknown to the Runaways, Molly's grandmother plucks a strand of hair from Victor's head with unclear intentions.Runaways Vol. 4 #4 Powers and abilities Victor Mancha is a cyborg, created from the DNA of Marianella Mancha and the technology of Ultron. Victor was constructed using advanced nanite technology that will evolve and mature with Victor into adulthood so that his robotic innards will transform into artificial human organs, indistinguishable from real ones. Ultron created Victor with several computer-related abilities, including a high level of intelligence, vast amounts of hard drive memory (which Victor refers to as photographic memory), and the ability to communicate with other machines directly. Victor also possesses some level of superhuman strength, incredible speed, a powerful jumping ability, and an automated self-repair function. In combat, Victor primarily employs his electromagnetic abilities; he is capable of directing high voltage electrical energy from his hands and manipulating magnetic fields to reshape and bend metallic objects. Much like Magneto, Victor can use Earth's natural magnetic lines of force to levitate and fly. Despite his array of powers, Victor has four known weaknesses, many of which stem from his mechanical roots. At his current age, Victor's nanites have not yet fully transformed into human organs, so his entire body will set off metal detectors, potentially drawing him unwanted attention. Second, Victor's mainframe can be hacked and controlled remotely; \\"Hunter\\" (of the second Pride) (Victor removed it with an internal firewall) and Ultron are the only two that have successfully hacked Victor thus far. Victor discovered his third weakness during the Runaways' first encounter with the Young Avengers, when he and the Vision both short-circuited upon getting too close to each other. The Runaways and Young Avengers eventually discovered that when any two of Ultron's creations come within a close vicinity, both create a devastating feedback, harming both machines. This weakness has apparently since been removed, as Victor has been shown interacting with the Vision's new family without any harm to either. While decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor's last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor's circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless binary, which Nico refers to as \\"the blue screen of death.\\" Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: \\"Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn't finish it?\\" The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question's answer from someone else. Once Victor's mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again. The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico. Other versions =What If?= In What If the Runaways became the Young Avengers?, Victor is first contacted by his future self of Victorious after Victorious traveled back from the future with Iron Lad, who accidentally landed in Victorious's time while attempting to escape Kang the Conqueror. Victor and Victorious steal the Iron Lad armor and Victor pretends to be Iron Lad. He then recruits the Runaways forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes, but intends to kill them. When Kang appears to rescue his younger self, the subsequent fight results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self rejecting his evil ways. Having averted his destiny, Victor then departs via Kang's time- belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor.What if the Runaways became the Young Avengers? =Age of Ultron= During the Age of Ultron storyline, Victor Mancha was bringing some children to one of the Runaways' old bases in Los Angeles. Victor is having a hard time because he believes that if he uses his machine abilities, he will just help Ultron‚Äôs victory. He does not tell any of his new found friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.Ultron #1AU =Avengers A.I.= In one alternate future, Alexis has a vision of 12,000 A.D. in which rogue A.I. Dimitrios wiped out humanity, the Kree, the Skrulls, and the Inhumans and traps all mutants in a pocket dimension. Only the Avengers A.I. survive, led by Alexis. Victor in this future wields Ultimate Thor's hammer and joins the surviving Avengers in attacking Dimitrios, who created a spaceship out of Galactus's carcass. He is killed by Dimitrios and Doombot then sacrifices himself, since Victor was the only person he considered a \\"Pal\\".Avengers A.I.

The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de B√©xar in the Mexican region of Texas. The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of B√©xar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province. Bored with the inactivity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them. After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on B√©xar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army. The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander- in-chief. On November 26, Texian scout Deaf Smith brought news of a Mexican pack train, accompanied by 50‚Äì100 soldiers, that was on its way to Bexar. The Texian camp was convinced that the pack train carried silver to pay the Mexican garrison and purchase supplies. Burleson ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 45‚Äì50 cavalry and intercept the train. An additional 100 infantry followed. On seeing the battle commence, Mexican General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos sent reinforcements from Bexar. The Texians repulsed several attacks by Mexican soldiers, who finally retreated to Bexar. When the Texians examined the abandoned pack train they discovered that, instead of silver, the mules carried freshly cut grass to feed the Mexican Army horses. Four Texians were injured, and historian Alwyn Barr states that three Mexican soldiers were killed, although Bowie and Burleson initially claimed the number was much higher.  Background  Gen. Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos, commander of the √Ålamo garrison On October 2, 1835, Texas colonistsMexican Texas included the land north of the Medina and the Nueces Rivers, northeast of the Rio Grande, west of San Antonio de B√©xar, and east of the Sabine River. According to Manchaca's Recovering History, Constructing Race: The Indian, Black, and White Roots of Mexican Americans, by 1834 an estimated 30,000 English speakers lived in Texas, compared to only 7,800 of Spanish heritage. attacked a Mexican force at the Battle of Gonzales, formally launching the Texas Revolution.Hardin (1994), p. 12. After the battle ended, disgruntled colonists continued to assemble in Gonzales, eager to put a decisive end to Mexican control over the area. On October 11 the disorganized volunteers elected Stephen F. Austin, who had settled the first English-speaking colonists in Texas, as their commander-in- chief.Barr (1990), p. 6. Several days later Austin marched his newly created Texian Army towards San Antonio de B√©xar, where General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos, brother-in-law of Mexican president Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, oversaw the garrison at the Alamo.Barr (1990), p. 15. In late October the Texians initiated a siege of B√©xar.Hardin (1994), p. 53.  Battle  At 10:00 a.m. on November 26, Texian scout Erastus \\"Deaf\\" Smith rode into camp to report that a pack train of mules and horses, accompanied by 50‚Äì100 Mexican soldiers, was within of B√©xar.Barr (1990), p. 39.Hardin (1994), p. 64. For several days, the Texians had heard rumors that the Mexican Army was expecting a shipment of silver and gold to pay the troops and purchase additional supplies.Todish et al. (1998), p. 24. The Texians had been fighting without pay, and most wanted to charge from camp and loot the expected riches. Burleson calmed the crowd and then ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 35‚Äì40 mounted men to investigate, but only attack if necessary. After Bowie recruited the army's 12 best marksmen for the expedition, there was little doubt that he intended to find a reason to attack. Burleson managed to stop the entire army from following by sending Colonel William Jack with 100 infantry to support Bowie's men.Edmondson (2000), p. 237. Colonel James Bowie led the Texian cavalry during the Grass Fight About from B√©xar, Bowie and his men spotted the Mexican soldiers crossing a dry ravine. This was likely near the confluence of the Alaz√°n, Apache, and San Pedro Creeks.Groneman (1998), p. 39. Bowie's men charged the Mexican party, scattering the mules. The mounted forces briefly exchanged fire, and then both sides dismounted and took cover in dry streambeds. The Mexican forces counterattacked but were repulsed. In B√©xar, General Cos saw the battle begin and sent 50 infantry and 1 cannon to provide cover so the cavalry could retreat to town. The Texian infantry also heard the initial shots and rushed toward the battle, at one point wading through waist- deep water. They approached the battlefield during a lull. The lack of noise made it difficult for them to ascertain where the Mexican troops were, and the Texians were surprised to find themselves between the Mexican cavalry and infantry. As the Mexican troops began firing, the Texian infantry troops dropped to the ground. Colonel Thomas Rusk led a group of 15 in an attack on the nearest Mexican cavalry; as those cavalrymen fled the Texian infantry was able to scramble to cover. The Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen. Burleson's father, James Burleson, led a cavalry advance on the Mexican position, yelling, \\"Boys, we have but once to die, they are here in the ditch. Charge them!\\"Barr (1990), p. 40. The Mexican artillery fired three times, driving the Texians back. Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to take a small rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. The Mexican infantry then attacked. Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: \\"These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men, preserving ... strict order and exhibiting no confusion.\\" The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry to try to take the Mexican cannon. The Mexican forces then withdrew towards B√©xar. Aftermath Colonel Thomas Rusk participated in the Grass Fight Four Texians were wounded in the fighting, and one soldier deserted during the battle.Edmondson (2000), p. 238. In his reports, Burleson claimed that 15 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 7 wounded, while Bowie claimed that 60 Mexican soldiers had been killed.Hardin (1994), p. 66. In his book Texans in Revolt: the Battle for San Antonio, 1835, historian Alwyn Barr stated that only 3 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 14 wounded; most of the casualties were from the cavalry companies. Burleson praised all of his officers for their conduct; Bowie received the most mention. The Texians captured 40 horses and mules. To their surprise, the saddlebags did not contain bullion. Instead, the mules had been carrying freshly cut grass to feed the Mexican horses trapped in B√©xar; this prize gave the battle its name. Although the engagement, which historian J. R. Edmondson termed a \\"ludicrous affair\\", did not yield valuable plunder, it did serve to unite the Texian Army. Days before, the army had been bitterly divided and unwilling to risk a prolonged siege or assault. With their success at the Grass Fight, however, the Texian soldiers began to believe that, although outnumbered, they could prevail over the B√©xar garrison. The Texians believed that Cos must have been desperate to send troops outside of the safety of B√©xar. Several days later, on December 1, a handful of Americans in B√©xar convinced Cos to allow them free passage from the city. Although they had promised to leave the country, the men, including Samuel Maverick,Barr (1990, p. 41. instead joined the Texian Army and provided information about the Mexican defenses and the low morale within the town. Buoyed by their Grass Fight victory, on December 5 the Texians launched an attack on B√©xar;Barr (1990, p. 42. Cos surrendered on December 9.Barr (1990), p. 56. As a condition of their parole, the Mexican troops were forced to leave the province, leaving the Texas colonists in full control.Barr (1990), p. 64.

It is located in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, Montreal, Quebec, at 1003 Decarie Boulevard. It overlooks downtown Montreal, and is close to Montreal General Hospital of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) hospital network, with which it is associated but not fully affiliated. The previous site of the institution (at 1529 Cedar Avenue) had outgrown its facilities, and since it was surrounded by Mount Royal Park, it could not expand in that location. Political uncertainty over relocation Following years of wrangling within the Shriners and in Quebec, a general vote of the Shriners would decide the future of the Canadian hospital. Originally slated to move to the new MUHC superhospital site, the project had been delayed more than a decade. However the delay proved decisive in the new Shriners president wanting the hospital to move out of Montreal. With the push for an alternate site, Ottawa and London, Ontario both pushed for the new facility. The Ottawa Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario hospital supported Montreal first, but if it were to move, it wanted it in Ottawa. An Ottawa location would not greatly affect access to those in the US Northeast, or eastern Canada, only being about 200 km from Montreal. The president of the Shriners brought up the potential threat of Quebec separation to influence the move out of the province. The search committee found that it was preferable to move to London, Ontario. However, the Shriners of Ottawa, Quebec, eastern Canada, and northeast USA oppose this decision. A vote to decide was held by the Shriners members at the meeting in Baltimore on July 5, 2005. Of a total of 1214 votes, 608 voted in favour of staying in Montreal, 605 of moving to London and one vote was refused. London Shriners withdrew their resolution on April 12, 2006. Two years following, unsatisfied with the prior decision, the London Shriners decided to invoke a last minute resolution to move the hospital once again, based on the fact the Quebec government still continued to delay the project or fully decontaminate the land where the hospital is to be built. The issue was decided with another vote that was held on July 3, 2007. Once again the vote swung in favour of staying in Montreal, with 75% of members voting against the move. Despite the decision, construction was still delayed and only 90% of the land had been decontaminated. As of 2010, construction of the new super hospital was still delayed, and with it delayed the new Shriners hospital as well. The London Shriners have vowed to re-attempt to move the hospital to Ontario. Construction of new building On October 13, 2011, the official ground breaking ceremony for the new Shriners hospital took place, on the site of the MUHC superhospital. Two years later, with construction well under way, a corner stone ceremony was held on September 22, 2013. The new Shriners building was completed in 2015.

Teenage musical life included playing bass guitar in an improvising rock band inspired by Cream. After leaving school at 16 start playing Bart√≥k and Debussy on the piano and writing piano pieces. Hearing Stockhausen on the radio he made a music concrete piece with his father's tape recorder and enrolled in a music course at Kingsway College in London. There he met composer/pianist and scratch orchestra member Dave Smith who introduced him to the experimental composition of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John White, Howard Skempton, Bryan's and Conlon Nancarrow. From 1974 to 1979 he studied music at Royal Holloway College and Goldsmiths College University of London During the 1970s he developed a strong interest in contemporary American composers who he started to perform: John Cage, Morton Feldman, Terry Riley, Reich and a public performance of Glass's Music in Fifth for solo amplified piano in 1978. Poppy also played in an ensemble with Christian Wolff and attended a summer school with Cage and Merce Cunningham. At Goldsmiths he started an ensemble with Jeremy Peyton Jones to play their own music. After graduating in 1979 he began working as an accompanist at the Laban Centre for Dance. In late 1979 Poppy was approached by Orlando Gough to start a new ensemble together. The Lost Jockey was formed and started performing Glass, Reich, Poppy and Gough scores. The first concert at the Air Gallery in Roseberry Avenue was attended by Michael Nyman. Lost Jockey and The Nyman Band performed together at the 2nd Almeida Music Festival in 1981. One of the least internationally known of British minimalist composers, with in contemporary classical circles, his concert score are only a fraction of his creative output and his artistic profile reaches into many strands of popular culture. His first solo album The Beating of Wings was released on Trevor Horn and Paul Morley's ZTT records in 1985, and the follow-up Alphabed (A Mystery Dance) in 1987. His third album for ZTT (Under the Son) was scheduled for release in 1988, but he left the label that year and most of its material appeared only in 2005 as part of a 3-CD collection of Poppy's ZTT works entitled Andrew Poppy on Zang Tuum Tumb. The collection comprised three tracks from Under the Son as well as the first two ZTT albums, some of whose tracks appeared in versions slightly different from their initial album appearances, as well as in 12\\" remixes. The music has been critically connected to both American experimental/minimalism and British electronica of cabaret voltaire He contributed orchestral arrangements to Force The Hand of Chance, the first album by the group Psychic TV which was released on WEA Records in 1982 and contributed compositions to Dreams Less Sweet, the follow up. Poppy's subsequent arrangements have appeared on records by groups such as Coil, Erasure, The The, The House of Love, Strawberry Switchblade and Nitzer Ebb. Poppy's first orchestral work 32 Frames was written in 1981 for the Goldsmiths College orchestra. It was recorded for the Beating of a Wings album in 1985 with the composer conducting. The music was later used for the Portuguese seminal 80's film A Girl In Summer directed by V√≠tor Gon√ßalves with additional material. Poppy worked on other Portuguese film projects in the early 1990s. Live performances are often theatrical or multimedia based. In the 80s this included a special show for the opening of the muscium of science and technology at la Villette in Paris and collaboration with experimental theatre companies. During the 1990s Poppy developed a number of opera projects. These and other productions often involved a collaboration with theatre, video and performance maker Julia Bardsley. On 9 June 2011, Poppy's early 1990s orchestra and live electronics work Revolution No. 8: Airport for Joseph Beuys featured as one of the works in Electronica III at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, the final event in a series of BBC Concert Orchestra concerts showcasing contemporary music and electronica. A collaboration between Poppy and German singer Claudia Br√ºcken (another ZTT artist in the 1980s who recorded with Propaganda and Act) resulted in the album Another Language in 2005. On this sparsely scored album of cover songs Poppy's piano and guitar playing accompanied Br√ºcken's vocals. Having used Schubert Songs as a model for arrangements on the album led Poppy to a more song and vocal based approach to his own composition. Poppy's style occupies a place between classical minimalism, Postminimalism and more popular genres, although individual pieces are not necessarily overtly minimalist. A wide range of ensembles have commissioned and/or performed his works at prestigious musical festivals including Noszferatu Ensemble and the Graham Fitkin Band. Poppy taught composition at Trinity College of Music in Greenwich, London. 2001-2014 The last 3 album projects have been presented as staged multi media musical performances including video and audio projection and lighting. With a core production team of Julia Bardsley (scenographer) Martin Langthorne (lighting) Fred De Feye (sound). Hoarse Songs released 1st May has been presented in London Lisbon Athens and Liverpool. In 2017 Liverpool's Capstone theatre commissioned a presentation of Poppy's first album The Beating of Wings.

It was one of three SAOs proclaimed on the territory of Croatia. The oblast included parts of the geographical regions of Slavonia, Baranja and Syrmia. The entity was formed on June 25, 1991, the same day the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to withdraw from Yugoslavia, following the Croatian independence referendum, 1991. In the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence, in 1992, the oblast joined the breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). After the fall of Republic of Serbian Krajina in 1995, there was a short-lived Serb parallel entity Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia that existed in the same area and was reintegrated with the rest of country after the signing of Erdut Agreement and the end of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in 1998. History On January 7, 1991 a group of political leaders of local Serbs from eastern regions of Croatia decided to create a regional political body, called the \\"Serbian National Council of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia\\". The SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was declared on June 25, 1991, and on June 26 its first president was declared to be Goran Had≈æiƒá. Like the SAO Krajina, it was developed by the Serbian National Council, but was the one representing Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Initially, it was a separate Serb autonomous region (oblast), but it subsequently joined the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in February 1992.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Croatia.html#Krajina Its borders were established by the end of 1991 as entrenched front lines of the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence. Up to August 1995, Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was de facto part of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, while de jure still part of Croatia, per United Nations Security Council Resolution 753. The region did not have its own local/regional administration within the RSK. Geography The territory of the former SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was part of the Central European Pannonian Basin. The eastern border of the oblast was mostly the Danube river, while approximately one third of the western border was the Drava river. The Kopaƒçki rit natural preserve located near the confluence of Drava and Danube formed a major geographical barrier - there were no road or rail connections between Baranja and the southern parts of the territory, except through Serbia. Other boundaries were not natural boundaries: the border with Hungary in the north had existed since the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the eastern border with FR Yugoslavia partly existed since the Kingdom of Slavonia (on the Danube) and was partly set with the formation of SFR Yugoslavia, while the border with the rest of Croatia in the west and south was formed after the fronts were settled in the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence. Eastern Slavonia is a mostly flat area, with the best type of soil where agriculture is highly developed, particularly on wheat fields, and it also has several forests as well as vineyards. The ƒêeletovci Oil fields are located between the villages of ƒêeletovci, Banovci and Nijemci. Traffic over the Brotherhood and Unity Highway (today the A3) was interrupted with the formation of the ESBWS. The water transport over the Danube river continued unobstructed. The Drava river was not navigated at the time. The railway line between Zagreb and Belgrade and the transport between the Budapest and Sarajevo passing through the area were also closed. Population The population of this area was ethnically mixed. Before the war, the total population of the area numbered 192,163 inhabitants, and was composed of: * 90,454 (47%) Croats, * 61,492 (32%) Serbs, and * 40,217 (21%) others (Hungarians, Roma, Yugoslavs, Germans, Rusyns, Slovaks, etc.). During the Croatian War of Independence, 109,500 Serbs lived in this area out of a total of 160,000.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Croatia.html#Krajina which means that the number of Serbs living there has almost doubled while the general population has decreased War crimes charges brought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia against Croatian Serb leader in the region, Goran Had≈æiƒá, indicate that virtually all Croat and other non-Serb population of the region was either killed, deported or otherwise forcibly removed from the area. Municipalities and Inhabited places During the existence of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, the region was divided into five municipalities: * Beli Manastir (in Baranja), * Dalj and Tenja (in eastern Slavonia), and * Vukovar and Mirkovci (in western Syrmia). The main cities in the area were Vukovar and Beli Manastir. Other important places included Borovo Selo, Darda, Dalj, Ilok, and Tenja. Legacy After the RSK's demise in August 1995, the region was reconstituted again as Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995-1998). Following the November 1995 Erdut Agreement, it was subsequently controlled by the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium Today the ethnic Serb interests in the region are advocated by the Joint Council of Municipalities.

His best-known work is Shane, which was made into the film Shane, and the short story \\"Stubby Pringle's Christmas\\" (1964). Biography Jack Schaefer was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and was the son of a German American attorney. In 1929 he graduated from Oberlin College with a major in English. From 1929-1930 he attended graduate school at Columbia University, but left without completing his Master of Arts degree. He then went to work for the United Press. In his long career as a journalist, he would hold editorial positions at many eastern publications. Schaefer's first success as a novelist came in 1946 with his novel Shane, set in Wyoming. Though Schaefer himself had never been in the western United States, he continued writing westerns, selling his house in Connecticut and moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1955 with his second wife, Louise. They resided in an old adobe home at 905 Camino Ranchitos, just off of Canyon Rd. In 1975 Schaefer received the Western Literature Association's Distinguished Achievement award. He died of heart failure in Santa Fe in 1991. Schaefer's novel Monte Walsh was made into a movie in 1970, with Lee Marvin in the title role, and again in 2003 as a TV movie starring Tom Selleck. Shane was also made into a movie and a series.

In its most general form, under an FDA framework each sample element is considered to be a function. The physical continuum over which these functions are defined is often time, but may also be spatial location, wavelength, probability, etc. Core theoretical contributions to FDA were made by James O. Ramsay of McGill University, who is also known for his contributions to multidimensional scaling. Level of error The data may be so accurate that error can be ignored, may be subject to substantial measurement error, or even have a complex indirect relationship to the curve that they define. For example, measurements of the heights of children over a wide range of ages have an error level so small as to be ignorable for many purposes, but daily records of precipitation at a weather station are so variable as to require careful and sophisticated analyses in order to extract something like a mean precipitation curve. Use of derivatives However these curves are estimated, it is the assumption that they are intrinsically smooth that often defines a functional data analysis. In particular, FDA often makes use of the information in the slopes and curvatures of curves, as reflected in their derivatives. Plots of first and second derivatives as functions of t, or plots of second derivative values as functions of first derivative values, may reveal important aspects of the processes generating the data. As a consequence, curve estimation methods designed to yield good derivative estimates can play a critical role in functional data analysis. Contrast with other methods The extensive use of kernel smoothing and smoothing splines to ensure smoothness assumptions signify why functional data analysis is at its core a nonparametric statistical technique. Nevertheless, models for functional data and methods for their analysis may resemble those for conventional multivariate data, including linear and nonlinear regression models, principal components analysis among others; that is because functional data can be thought of as multivariate data with order on its dimensions. But the possibility of using derivative information greatly extends the power of these methods, and also leads to purely functional models such as those defined by differential equations, often called dynamical systems.

Unlike most of Ditko's work, the character of Mr. A remained the property of Ditko, who wrote and illustrated the stories in which the character appeared entirely himself. The character first appeared in Wally Wood's witzend #3 (1967). Ditko has been quoted as saying that his creation, The Question, is a comics-code acceptable version of Mr. A.Mr. A at vicsage.com Mr. A was inspired by Objectivism, the belief system and moral absolutism of the philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand. Fictional character biography Rex Graine is a newspaper reporter for the Daily Crusader. He is known for his uncompromising principles and incorruptibility. In order to fight crime, Graine wears metal gloves and a steel mask that resembles a placid face, thus becoming Mr. A. In keeping with the hardboiled detective theme, both personae typically wear suits and fedora hats; Mr. A's outfit is completely white. There is no origin story for the character, thus the only discernible reason why Graine sometimes disguises himself (both his identities are equally threatened by criminals and sometimes hated by the general public) is due to his choice to become a vigilante. Mr. A uses half white-half black calling cards to signify his arrival, as well as to represent his belief that there can only be good and evil, and no moral grey area. Influence Comics creator Alan Moore was once a member of a band the Emperors of Ice Cream which performed a Moore-penned song entitled \\"Mr. A.\\" (to the tune of the The Velvet Underground's song \\"Sister Ray\\") parodying Steve Ditko's political ideology.In Search of Steve Ditko. BBC. 2007. Moore later created the character Rorschach for the series Watchmen, which was based on both The Question and Mr. A. Moore related a story about an unspecified acquaintance who said he asked Ditko about whether he was familiar with Rorschach. Reportedly, Ditko acknowledged Rorschach as being \\"like Mr. A, except...insane\\".

Retrieved January 6, 2013 from HighBeam Research She was the sister of actresses Polly Ann and Loretta Young and the half-sister of actress Georgiana Young. Career Blane had her film debut at the age of seven when she appeared in Sirens of the Sea in 1917. She returned to the film business as an adult in the 1920s, playing small parts in a number of silent films. Her career continued into the 1930s when Blane appeared in several low-budget films, including Once a Sinner (1930), A Dangerous Affair (1930), Arabian Knights (1931), Annabelle's Affairs (1931), Hello Everybody!

Some of her scenes, including one in Annabelle's Affairs, in which she appeared in skimpy lingerie with Jeanette MacDonald and Joyce Compton, were risqu√© for their day, pre-dating the industry's Hays Code that largely forbade such shots after 1934. The footage from Annabelle's Affairs is considered lost. Although her appearances began to fade toward the late 1930s, Blane acted in over 100 films.

He also formed the Executive Board of India in Japan in 1940 during the Second World War. He also took part in the Balkan War in the year 1911 along with his fellow students of MAO college. In recognition of his services, the government of India issued postage stamps in his honor.  Early life  Pratap was born in the ruling Jat family of the princely state of Mursan in the Hathras District of Uttar Pradesh on 1 December 1886. He was the third son of Raja Ghanshyam Singh. At the age of three, Raja Harnarayan Singh of Hathras adopted him as his son.Bhattacharya, Abinash Chandra (1962). Bahirbharate Bharater Muktiprayas (in Bengali), Kalikata:Firma K.L.Mukhopadhyaya, pp. 9‚Äì24 He was married to Balveer Kaur belonging to the ruling Sidhu Jat family of Jind, a princely state of Haryana (then in Punjab) in 1902 while studying in college. He died in 1979. Education In 1895 Pratap was admitted to the Government High School in Aligarh, but soon he switched over to the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental Collegiate School which later on became Aligarh Muslim University Here he received his education under British Headmasters and Muslim teachers all from Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Aligarh founded by Sir Sayed Ahmad Khan. He could not complete his graduation and left MAO in 1905. In 1977, AMU, under V-C Prof A M Khusro, felicitated Mahendra Pratap at the centenary celebrations of MAO. With this background he shaped into a true representative of secular society. To bring India to a par with European countries, Pratap established the free indigenous technical institute Prem Mahavidyalaya in his palace at Vrindavan on 24 May 1909.  Nobel prize nomination  He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1932.The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Peace, 1901‚Äì1955. nobelprize.org N.A. Nilsson, his nominator, said about him- \\"Pratap gave up his property for educational purposes, and he established a technical college at Brindaban. In 1913 he took part in Gandhi's campaign in South Africa. He traveled around the world to create awareness about the situation in Afghanistan and India. In 1925 he went on a mission to Tibet and met the Dalai Lama. He was primarily on an unofficial economic mission on behalf of Afghanistan, but he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in India. He called himself the servant of the powerless and weak.\\" While nominating for the Peace Nobel Prize, the nominator in a short biography, gave Singh's status as follows: Singh \\"is the editor of the World Federation and an unofficial envoy of Afghanistan. The nominator wrote a short biography as well as international political activities. Particularly his role in the Indo- Turco-German mission was highlighted. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Sultan Mohemmod Rishad of Turkey gave him letters for the Afghan King. He arrived in Kabul on Oct. 2, 1915. On December 1, 1915, a Provisional Government for India was organised. Pratap was declared as its President. In 1917 he went to Russia and met Trotsky at Leningrad. From there he came back to meet Kaiser and Sultan, to give the message of the King of Afghanistan. He passed some time in Budapest and Switzerland. He was brought by German aeroplane to Russia, where he met Lenin. From there he went to Afghanistan. King Amanullah sent him on a mission to China, Tibet, Japan, Siam, Germany, Turkey and the U.S.A. After an agreement with the British, the King lost interest in Pratap. In the end, it is summarized: ‚ÄúHe is primarily on an unofficial economic mission of Afghanistan. However, being born as an Indian he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in that land of the idealist Americans. At this juncture, when the great freedom movement of India is developing with large momentum it is in the interest of the spiritually minded as well as business people to study carefully this new phenomenon of our social life. ‚Ä¶. He hopes to achieve some practical results in this direction during his present sojourn in this country (U.S.A.). He is planning to establish an Afghanistan information bureau and an office of the World Federation at Washington, D.C. He just tries to do his duty according to his best understanding and leaves the working of fate to the Laws of Nature!\\".. \\"It will be of interest to know ‚Äì Why a Swede nominated Singh? The answer is to be found in the documents, which were sent with the nomination letter. Namely, Singh supported the idea of ‚ÄúWorld Federation‚Äù, about which N.A. Nilsson, propagated in 1910, as is evident from: ‚ÄúF√©d√©ration Internationale ‚Äì Discours Au ‚Äì xviii Congr√©s Universel de la paix (International Federation ‚Äì Speeches in ‚Äì xviii Universal Congress of Peace).\\"Rajinder, Singh (2016) Inside Story of Nobel Peace Prize Award ‚Äì Indian Contestants. Shaker, Aachen. pp. 21‚Äì30. Freedom movement In spite of objections from his father-in- law, Pratap went to Kolkata in 1906 to attend the Congress session, and met several leaders involved in the Swadeshi movement, deciding to promote small industries with indigenous goods and local artisans. He was very much against social evils, especially untouchability. To eliminate this evil he dined with a Tamata family of Almora in 1911, and a Mehtar family of Agra in 1912. He was influenced by the speeches of Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Maharaja Baroda, and Bipin Chandra Pal, helping to make him a patriot who turned Swadeshi. He started the movement to burn the foreign-made clothes in his state. After trying sincerely to liberate his motherland, on 20 December 1914 at the age of 28 Pratap left India for the third time, with a desire to liberate India from the clutches of British colonial rule by obtaining outside support. In January 1915 on learning about his presence in Switzerland, Chatto alias Virendranath Chattopadhyay of the newly founded Berlin Committee (Deutsche Verein der Freunde Indien) requested Von Zimmermann of the German foreign ministry to get Pratap invited to Berlin. Already Chatto had sent a first mission to Afghanistan led by the Parsi revolutionary Dada Chanji Kersasp. Informed about Chatto's activities from Shyamji Krishnavarma and Lala Hardayal, Pratap insisted on meeting the Kaiser Wilhelm II personally; Chatto rushed to Geneva to tell Pratap of the Kaiser's eagerness to see him, and they went to Berlin together. Har Dayal, too, followed them. Decorating Pratap with the Order of the Red Eagle, the Kaiser showed his awareness of the strategic position of the Phulkian States (Jind, Patiala and Nabha), if India was invaded through the Afghan frontier. According to Pratap's wish, he was taken to a military camp near the Polish border to gain a firsthand knowledge of army policies and functioning. On 10 April 1915 accompanied by the German diplomat Werner Otto von Hentig, Maulavi Barkatullah and a few other members, Pratap left Berlin, with due credentials from the Kaiser. In Vienna the delegation met the Khedive of Egypt who during a conversation with Pratap expressed his desire to see the end of the British Empire. On their way, in Turkey they had an visit with Enver Pasha, son-in-law of the Sultan and Defense Minister, who appointed a trusted military officer to guide them. They were received by Rauf Bey with a detachment of 2000 soldiers at Ispahan. They reached Kabul on 2 October and were greeted by Habibullah, having a number of discussions.

On 1 December 1915 during World War I (his 28th birthday) Pratap established the first Provisional Government of India at Kabul in Afghanistan as a government-in-exile of Free Hindustan, with himself as President, Maulavi Barkatullah as Prime Minister, and Maulavi Ubaidullah Sindhi as Home Minister, declaring jihad on the British.Contributions of Raja Mahendra Prata by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, International Seminar on Raja Mahendra Pratap & Barkatullah BhopaliMaulavi Barkatullah, Barkatulla University, Bhopal, 1‚Äì3 December 2005. Anti-British forces supported his movement, but because of obvious loyalty to the British, the Amir kept on delaying the expedition to overthrow British rule in India. Due to his revolutionary ideas Pratap had a good relationship with Lenin, who invited him to Russia after its liberation and welcomed him. By this time, the British had noticed his activities, and the British Government of India put a bounty on his head, attached/confiscated his entire estate, and declared him a fugitive, causing him to flee to Japan in 1925. In Japan In Japan he published the 'World Federation Monthly Magazine' in 1929, trying his best to use the world war situations to free India. During Second World War he stayed at Tokyo in Japan and continued his movement from 'World Federation Centre' to free India from British rule. He formed the Executive Board of India in Japan in 1940 during Second World War. At last the British government relented and Raja Mahendra Pratap was permitted to come to India from Tokyo with respect. Back to India He returned to India after 32 years on the ship City of Paris, and landed at Madras on 9 August 1946. On reaching India he immediately rushed to Wardha to meet Mahatma Gandhi. After independence also he continued his struggle for transfer of power to the common man. His vision was that the Panchayat Raj was the only tool which can put real power in the hands of people and reduce corruption and bureaucratic hurdles. He was the president of Indian Freedom Fighters' Association and was also the president of All India Jat Mahasabha. He was a member of the second Lok Sabha in 1957‚Äì1962. He was elected as an independent candidate from Mathura constituency defeating Bharatiya Jana Sangh (which would later evolved into BJP) candidate and the future Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the 1957 Lok Sabha Elections.STATISTICAL REPORT ON GENERAL ELECTIONS, 1957 TO THE SECOND LOK SABHA.

Lincoln Park High School, operated by the Chicago Public Schools District, opened its main present building in 1900. The school borders Oz Park, a public park owned by the Chicago Park District. It was formerly known as North Division High School and then Robert A. Waller High School. In 1981, the school began its International Baccalaureate program. It was one of the first schools to begin the program within the Chicago Public Schools district. History The then‚Äînew Waller High School in 1899, was renamed Lincoln Park High School in 1979. Lincoln Park High School began as North Division High School, which opened in 1875, as the first public high school on the north side of Chicago. By the late 1890s, the school needed more room, and construction began on the current school building in 1899. This building opened as Robert A. Waller High School in 1900. The students and staff of North Division relocated to the new building and the old name remained in use, alongside the new name, for several decades. By the 1910s, a concern grew that the school would soon need more room, and plans began to expand the school. It would not be until 1928 when land north of the school was obtained, and plans for an annex were pushed forward; plans that were interrupted with start of the Great Depression. The need for more space became critical, and the school's Franklin Branch was opened in 1934 (closing in 1948). In 1938, the school's annex was constructed to alleviate the need for portable classrooms. The new annex included (among others) two new gyms, which allowed for the original gymnasium to be converted into a lunch room for students. By the 1960s, the school's increased population required the return of portable classrooms as plans began for more expansion. The new north wing included a new lunch room and auditorium, allowing the old lunch room to become an office complex for counselors, and the library to move into the former assembly hall. The 1970s saw problems as the school aged and discipline issues caused the opening of an alternative satellite center for the school. As a part of the revitalization to the school in the late 1970s, the school's name was changed to its current name, and Orchard Street in front of the school was closed to create a mall between neighboring Oz Park and Armitage Street. Programs Lincoln Park High School is made up of four smaller programs. There is the neighborhood Chicago Public high school, the Fine Arts/Performing Arts school, the International Baccalaureate Program (which is one of the most selective IB programs in the city), and the double honors/honors high school program. Most students take part in classes in more than one program, except for students in the IB program who follow a prescribed curriculum. Students in the IB Diploma Program only take classes with other IB DP students, with the exception of music and/or arts classes, lunch, and physical education. There is a JROTC Program at Lincoln Park. The Performing Arts program requires auditions in order for students to be considered for enrollment. The music program consists of orchestra through all levels from beginning to symphony, and band from beginning to concert/marching band. There is also a jazz band option for advanced musicians. Students participating in the music program (with the exception of those also participating in the IB Diploma program) are required to take two years of Music Theory, at both the regular and AP levels. The drama program has multiple levels and produces numerous shows throughout the school year.

Preston took off in a stolen Bell UH-1B Iroquois \\"Huey\\" helicopter from Tipton Field, Maryland, and landed it on the South Lawn of the White House in a major breach of security. Preston had enlisted in the Army to become a helicopter pilot, but he did not graduate from the helicopter training course and lost his opportunity to attain the rank of warrant officer pilot. He was bound by his enlistment to serve four years in the Army, and he was sent to Fort Meade as a helicopter mechanic. Preston believed that this situation was unfair and later said that he stole the helicopter to show his skill as a pilot. Shortly after midnight, Preston, on leave, was returning to Tipton Field, south of Fort Meade. Thirty helicopters at the base were fueled and ready to fly; he took off in one without anti-collision lights on or making the standard radio calls. The Maryland State Police were alerted, and Preston flew southwest toward Washington, D.C., where he hovered close to the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument and over the South Lawn of the White House. He then flew back toward Fort Meade, with two Bell 206 JetRanger police helicopters and police cars in pursuit. After a chase over Maryland, he reversed course toward Washington again and entered the White House grounds. This time, the Secret Service opened fire. Preston was lightly wounded, landed the helicopter, and was arrested and held in custody. In the plea bargain at his court-martial, Preston pleaded guilty to \\"wrongful appropriation and breach of the peace\\" and was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of . He had already been in prison for six months, and had to serve six additional months. After his release, Preston received a general discharge from the army, then lived a quiet life, married, and died of cancer in 2009. Background Robert Kenneth Preston was born in Panama City, Florida, in 1953. He enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at Rutherford High School and had longtime aspirations toward a military career. He earned a private pilot's license for single-engine, fixed-wing aircraft, and studied aviation management at Gulf Coast Community College, hoping to become a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. After enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1972, he trained to become a helicopter pilot, flying the Hughes TH-55 Osage at Fort Wolters, Texas. He failed the technical training due to \\"deficiency in the instrument phase\\", losing his opportunity to become a warrant officer pilot. The ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and consequent surplus of qualified helicopter pilots may have also been a factor in Preston not being accepted as a pilot. Preston was still bound by his four-year obligation to serve with the U.S. Army, and he was sent to Fort Meade, Maryland, as a helicopter mechanic in January 1974. At the time of the incident, he was 20 years old, with the rank of private first class; he was described by his commanding officer as a \\"regular, quiet individual\\" with above-average intelligence. Incident alt=refer to caption On February 17, 1974, shortly after midnight, Preston left a dance hall and restaurant, downhearted due to a failed relationship and his unclear future in his military career. He returned to the Army Airfield, Tipton Field, south of Fort Meade, where thirty Bell UH-1 Huey helicopters were fueled and ready. Preston later recalled that \\"I wanted to get up and fly and get behind the controls. It would make me feel better because I love flying\\". He parked his car at the unguarded airfield, climbed into one of the helicopters, serial number 62‚Äì1920, and started preflight checks. Soon after, he lifted off without activating his anti-collision lights or making standard radio calls; a controller in the control tower spotted the stolen helicopter and alerted the Maryland State Police. Preston flew low over the restaurant he had visited earlier, then briefly touched down in a nearby field where his hat was later recovered. He then decided to visit Washington, D.C., southwest, by following the lights of the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway. Preston's helicopter was first discovered by the District of Columbia police when he was spotted hovering between the United States Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial. Flight over this area was strictly prohibited, but this was not enforced in any significant way at the time; surface-to-air missiles were not installed around Washington until after the September 11 attacks. Preston spent 5‚Äì6 minutes hovering a couple of feet above the Washington Monument's grounds, then flew over the Capitol, and went on to follow Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The Secret Service policy, at the time, was to fire at aerial intruders, but when to do so was left vague‚Äîespecially if it could harm bystanders. While Preston was hovering above and briefly touched down on the South Lawn, the White House Executive Office control center watch officer, Henry S. Kulbaski, attempted to contact his superiors by phone but received no answer. After the helicopter departed, Kulbaski ordered his agents to shoot it down if it returned. At 12:56 a.m., an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport noticed a blip on his radar scope; after realizing it was the stolen helicopter, the controller alerted the police. Preston then turned back toward Fort Meade in Maryland and left the restricted airspace; an old Bell 47 helicopter of the Maryland Police followed, but was too slow to keep up with Preston. The stolen helicopter soon appeared on the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington International Airport's radar, and two Maryland State Police Bell 206 JetRangers were dispatched to intercept. Preston turned northeast, pursued by the two helicopters and police cars. He caused one police car to crash by executing a head-on pass just a few inches above its roof, briefly hovered above a doughnut shop, then followed the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway once again toward Washington, planning to surrender personally to U.S. President Richard Nixon. Preston evaded one of the JetRangers with what its pilots described as \\"modern dogfighting tactics\\". With only one helicopter left chasing him, Preston flew along the Parkway at constantly changing speeds between , sometimes just inches above car-top level. alt=refer to caption Preston's Huey came in over the White House grounds at 2 a.m., barely clearing the steel fence surrounding the area. According to the pilot of the JetRanger, Preston was so close, he \\"could have driven right in the front door\\". The helicopter was suddenly illuminated by floodlights, and the Secret Service agents opened fire with automatic weapons and shotguns. Shots hit Preston's foot, and the helicopter veered to the side, bouncing on one skid, but he was able to regain control and settled his helicopter on the South Lawn, from the mansion. Some 300 rounds were fired, of which five hit Preston, causing superficial wounds. He exited the helicopter and started running toward the White House, but was tackled to the ground by Secret Service agents. Handcuffed, Preston was taken to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for treatment, where he arrived smiling and \\"laughing like hell\\". At the time of the incident, Richard Nixon was traveling in Florida, and First Lady Pat Nixon was in Indianapolis, visiting their sick daughter, Julie. Aftermath The helicopter became a major tourist sight that day. It was evaluated by army personnel and found to be flightworthy despite its many bullet holes, and was flown off in front of cameras from many major TV networks and reporters shortly before noon. The helicopter was extensively photographed as part of the investigation, then was repaired and returned to service. It was later put on display at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove. It is believed that Preston's actions influenced Samuel Byck to attempt to hijack a plane five days later, carrying a .22 caliber revolver and a gasoline bomb. According to self-recorded audio from prior to the hijacking, Byck intended to assassinate President Nixon. Police shot him, and he died by suicide. Preston was initially charged with unlawful entry into the White House grounds, a misdemeanor with a fine of and a maximum six-month jail term. His lawyers arranged a plea bargain in which all charges under civilian jurisdiction would be dropped if the case were transferred to the military. At his court-martial, he was charged with several counts of attempted murder and several minor offences. The pilot of one of the JetRangers stated that he had thought that Preston intended to commit suicide by crashing into the White House, but Preston maintained that he only wanted to draw attention to the perceived unfairness of his situation and show his skill as a pilot. He pled guilty to \\"wrongful appropriation and breach of the peace\\" and was sentenced to one year in prison and fined . The duration of his court-martial was given to him as time served; this meant he had to serve a further six months in prison. He instead served two months at Fort Riley, Kansas, before being granted a general discharge from the Army for unsuitability. The Secret Service increased the size of the restricted airspace around the White House. Nixon congratulated Kulbaski and the pilot and copilot of the JetRanger; the three and other agents were presented with pairs of presidential cufflinks in a White House ceremony. Preston moved to the state of Washington after his release. He married in 1982 and raised his wife's two daughters. He died of cancer on July 21, 2009, while living in Ephrata, Washington.

This source book was a completely unlicensed product, and although TSR (the then-owner of the Dungeons & Dragons trademark) had a precedent of threatening legal action against similar supplements, Kenzer & Company was never threatened.Games & The Law, Part Seven: The D&D; Dilemma With the launch of Dungeons & Dragons‚Äôs 3rd edition, Wizards of the Coast made the d20 System available under the Open Game License (OGL) and d20 Trademark License. Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. Shortly after Wizards of the Coast announced the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons, they announced jointly with Kenzer & Company that Kenzer had acquired a license to produce official Dungeons & Dragons material, using the Kalamar setting exclusively. With the release of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast introduced its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared with the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In response, Kenzer & Company launched an updated version of Kingdoms of Kalamar compatible with the 4th-edition version of Dungeons & Dragons that did not conform to the new GSL for approved use, instead releasing the campaign setting as an unlicensed supplement, similar to the original publication.

It was the most outstanding defiance of executive power regarding the war prior to 1971. The amendment was proposed by Senators George McGovern of South Dakota and Mark Hatfield of Oregon, and was known as the \\"amendment to end the war.\\" The amendment was heavily opposed by the administration of President Richard Nixon. A revision of the amendment intended to gain more widespread support extended the deadline for withdrawal to the end of 1971. Nevertheless, the amendment was opposed by Nixon and his backers in the Congress, who argued that a withdrawal deadline would devastate the American position in negotiations with North Vietnam. On September 1, 1970, the amendment failed by a 55‚Äì39 margin. McGovern's speech Minutes before the voting began, McGovern appealed for support with the strongest and most emotional language he had ever used regarding the war: According to historian Robert Mann, McGovern's brief, passionate speech shocked his Senate colleagues. As McGovern took his seat, most senators sat in stunned silence. \\"You could have heard a pin drop,\\" recalled John Holum, McGovern's principal staff advisor on Vietnam. As the Senate prepared to begin voting on the amendment, one senator approached McGovern and indignantly told him that he had been personally offended by the speech. McGovern replied, \\"That's what I meant to do.\\" pp. 666‚Äì669 Text of the amendment McGovern‚ÄìHatfield Amendment, H.R. 17123 (a) In accordance with public statements of policy by the President, no funds authorized by this or any other act may be obligated or expended to maintain a troop level of more than 280,000 armed forces of the United States in Vietnam after April 30, 1971. (b) After April 30, 1971, funds herein authorized or hereafter appropriated may be expended in connection with activities of American Armed Forces in and over Indochina only to accomplish the following objectives: :(1) the orderly termination of military operations there and the safe and systematic withdrawal of remaining armed forces by December 31, 1971; :(2) to secure the release of prisoners of war; :(3) the provision of asylum for Vietnamese who might be physically endangered by withdrawal of American forces; and :(4) to provide assistance to the Republic of Vietnam consistent with the foregoing objectives; provided however, that if the President while giving effect to the foregoing paragraphs of this section, finds in meeting the termination date that members of the American armed forces are exposed to unanticipated clear and present danger, he may suspend the application of paragraph 2(a) for a period not to exceed 60 days and shall inform the Congress forthwith of his findings; and within 10 days following application of the suspension the President may submit recommendations, including (if necessary) a new date applicable to subsection b(1) for Congressional approval.Congressional Research Service, Congressional Restrictions on U.S. Military Operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Somalia, and Kosovo: Funding and Non-Funding Approaches, January 16, 2007.

Loo served as an anchor and also traveled extensively to cover news in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. She later became a freelance reporter for ABC Radio, reporting on major news events in South Korea, North Korea and Japan. She also anchored an English-language newscast on Japan Cable TV before moving to New York City in 1989. Loo served as a freelance television reporter for News 12 Long Island in 1989 and 1990.

In 1992, she became one of the original \\"video journalists\\" on NY1 (New York One), the all-news cable channel for New York City owned by Time Warner. As a VJ, Loo covered the health beat, serving as a videographer and shooting her own stand-ups in front of the camera. She was also a fill-in anchor and won the Women in Cable National Anchor of the Year Award for her performance anchoring non-stop from 4:00 p.m. to 1:15 a.m. on the day of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. The blast knocked out the rooftop antennas that broadcast signals for other television stations in New York City, so NY1 was the only local TV news outlet to remain \\"on the air\\" that day. WABC-TV, the flagship for the ABC station group, hired Loo in 1994 as a general assignment reporter and later created an on-set daily health news segment for her on the early morning newscast.

In addition, he had a law degree from the University of Poznan. During the war, Kassern lived in Lviv, Cracow and Warsaw. In the Nazi occupied parts of Poland Kassern was using false identity papers to protect himself from the Gestapo. In the post-war years, he served as a cultural attach√© in New York to the new Polish government. In 1948 Kassern, after a brief visit to the communist-ruled Poland, suddenly resigned his position, renounced his Polish citizenship and applied for US asylum. Kassern's application for asylum was denied due to missing a deadline set for asylum seekers; depressed, he attempted suicide. He worked for the Third Street Music School Settlement and the Dalcroze School of Music in New York City. Among his compositions are three operas, symphonic suite \\"Tatry\\", solo concertos for flute, piano, oboe and double bass, cantatas, songs with piano accompaniment, and several solo piano works.

The film is Araki's eighth, premiering at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004, although it was not more widely distributed until 2005. Mysterious Skin tells the story of two pre-adolescent boys who both experienced a strange event as children, and how it affects their lives in different ways into their young adulthood. One boy becomes a reckless, sexually adventurous male prostitute, while the other retreats into a reclusive fantasy of alien abduction. Plot Two eight-year-old Little League teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life- altering events during the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is sexually abused by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of a house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours. Neil views the coach's abuse as love and becomes attracted to \\"bearish\\" middle-aged men. He begins prostituting himself at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS and (instead of sex) only wants to feel another person's touch. Afterwards, Neil begins withdrawing from prostitution and takes a job at a sandwich shop with assistance and encouragement from Wendy. Brian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts, and bedwetting for years after entering the crawl space. He also has recurring dreams about being touched by a strange, bluish hand, which eventually lead Brian to suspect that he may have been abducted by aliens. Another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear in these dreams later on. At 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen who also believes that she was abducted by aliens. They start to form a friendship, but when she makes advances towards him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again. Brian sees a photo of his Little League team as he tries to untangle his confused memories, recognizing a young Neil as the other boy from his dreams. Meanwhile, after a john brutally rapes and beats him, Neil returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. There, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the Little League coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil after a baseball game was rained out, as Brian did not have a ride. Instead, they all went to the coach's house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. At one point, Brian collapsed face- first onto the floor, giving him a bloody nose, while a nearby porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color. Having finally learned the truth, Brian breaks down crying and is comforted by Neil as Christmas carolers sing ‚ÄúSilent Night\\".

Trachtenberg was filming EuroTrip (2004) in Prague when she first received the script, and quickly decided to join production. Gordon-Levitt was especially praiseful of Araki for allowing him to join production, and commented in a 2005 interview: \\"It is a really different role for me, and I'll always be really grateful to Gregg for believing that I could do a role like this. I've played the nice kid, and the smart one or funny one and even the angry one, but Gregg was the first one to call me sexy, and I'll always be really grateful for that.\\" Araki approached Gordon-Levitt, who was by then struggling to find work for over a year, after seeing him in Manic (2001). Made on a low budget, filming commenced in August 2003 and lasted only three weeks, which gave the cast and crew no possibility of doing retakes. A number of measures were taken to avoid exposing the child actors to the sexual and abusive aspects of the story. Although their parents were given the entire shooting script to review, the boys were given separate scripts which included only the activities they would be performing, and their roles and the characters' relationships were explained to them in innocent terms. All of the sexual abuse involving children is implied rather than being directly depicted, and the scenes in which this seduction and abuse takes place were filmed with each actor performing alone and addressing the camera rather than the other actor, then edited together, so the children did not see or hear the performance by the adult actor playing the abuser. (This subjective approach to filming was consequently used in various places throughout the film.)'Interview: Under the \\"Mysterious Skin\\"' Director and actors' commentary track on DVD release Reception Mysterious Skin received very positive reviews. The film received an 85% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 108 reviews with an average rating of 7.31/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Bold performances and sensitive, spot-on direction make watching this difficult tale of trauma and abuse a thought-provoking, resonant experience.\\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 32 reviews. Lou Lumenick from the New York Post commented, \\"Not for the squeamish, but it is a beautifully crafted and thoughtful film that genuinely provokes.\\" Ella Taylor from LA Weekly wrote ‚ÄúA warped, but beautiful and strangely hopeful, coming-of-age tale.‚Äù Roger Ebert gave Mysterious Skin 3.5 out of a possible 4 stars, describing it as \\"at once the most harrowing and, strangely, the most touching film I have seen about child abuse.\\" Steven Rhea of The Philadelphia Inquirer awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that \\"Mysterious Skin\\" ultimately \\"manages to deal with its raw, awful subject matter in ways that are both challenging and illuminating.\\"'Mysterious Skin' Reviews Rotten Tomatoes Gordon-Levitt was praised by critics for his performance, and the actor has stated that people on the streets had come up to him to applaud his performance in the film. His portrayal of a teenage hustler inspired director Scott Frank to cast him in The Lookout (2007). According to psychologist Richard Gartner,Gartner, Richard. \\"Cinematic Depictions of Boyhood Sexual Victimization (part 5 of 5)\\". Originally published in Gender and Psychoanalysis (1999) Volume 4:253-289. the novel Mysterious Skin is an uncommonly accurate portrayal of the long-term effect of child sexual abuse on boys. =Rating issues= The US MPAA rated the film NC-17, which the studio appealed unsuccessfully. The film was released theatrically in the US without a rating. The film was the subject of some controversy in Australia, where the Australian Family Association requested a review of its classification, seeking to have the film outlawed due to its depiction of pedophilia. They suggested that the film could be used by pedophiles for sexual gratification or to help them groom children for sexual abuse. The six-member Classification Review Board voted four-to-two in favour of maintaining an R18+ rating. The controversy is referenced in a review excerpt from The Sydney Morning Herald on the Region 4 DVD that reads: \\"How anyone could have wanted it banned is beyond me\\"; film critic Margaret Pomeranz expressed that the film does more for the case against pedophilia, stating: \\"People who do indulge in crimes like that, if they saw this film they would understand the damage that they do.\\" Soundtrack The film score was composed by Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie.

History The hospital was built by Six Companies while the company was building Hoover Dam. The hospital opened on November 15, 1931 with 20 beds. The hospital closed in 1935 when the dam was finished. It was not until 1943 when the hospital reopened.About Boulder City Hospital The old hospital building, currently called The Life-Giving Spring Retreat Center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was abandoned when a new building for the hospital opened on December 8, 1973, a mile away to the southwest at the intersection of Adams Boulevard and Buchanan Boulevard, on the southeast corner. =The Beginning= By Dennis McBride: Boulder City's first hospital was built by the Six Companies, the group responsible for building Hoover Dam. The U.S. Public Health Service, the government agency that would have been responsible for maintaining health in the dam town, couldn't afford to build a hospital. A second government agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, felt since the majority of workers on the project were employed by Six Companies, it was the companies‚Äô responsibility to build and maintain a hospital. The government worked out an arrangement by which Bureau employees could also use the hospital. The hospital site was the top of Block 8, a hill on the northeast side of town originally reserved for a resort hotel. The view from the hospital was magnificent: the Eldorado Valley and McCullough Mountains to the south, and to the north the Colorado River wound lazily through its bed. Construction began in August 1931 and the hospital was opened November 15, 1931. The cost of the original Boulder City Hospital was $20,000. The hospital was built of brick and white stucco, and the L-shaped building housed 20 beds and a special orthopedic ward. The Pest House, an eight-bed isolation facility for contagious diseases, was maintained away from the main hospital building. In 1933, a wing was added to the hospital as an isolation ward and the Pest House was torn down. Six Companies employees were charged $1.50 per month health fee through payroll deduction which entitled them, but not their families, to services at Boulder City Hospital. Family members of the dam workers were forced to travel to Las Vegas for care. When the dam was finished in 1935 and the Six Companies left Boulder, the hospital was closed. Those needing medical care went to Las Vegas. In some emergency cases, the time to travel into town proved fatal. In 1938, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for the hospital building and turned it into a museum and office. The Park Service left the building in 1941 and the building remained vacant for two years. =War Years and Citizen Patrol= In December 1943, the U.S. Public Health Service reopened the hospital to care for war wounded. While the Bureau of Reclamation wanted to build a new hospital and had the money, building materials were unavailable. The Bureau simply remodeled the old hospital and signed a memorandum of agreement with the Health Service, providers of refurbished equipment to the hospital. Town residents cleaned and repaired the second-hand x-ray machines, sterilizers, beds and other items that came from hospitals around the country. Town residents also donated money for an ambulance and organized a volunteer ambulance corps. Subscription to this service was $15 per year. Membership entitled the bearer to one ride to the hospital. In 1949 the Bureau of Reclamation took control of the hospital which continuously lost money. The hospital served the city well enough but it proved to be a financial drain on the government. In 1954, with no forewarning, the Bureau dumped the hospital. If Boulder City wanted a hospital, it had to raise $15,000 in two weeks to cover operating expenses and maintenance. The townspeople rallied and began a door-to-door fundraising campaign called ‚ÄòSave the Hospital‚Äô on February 25, 1954. By March 18 the fund surpassed $15,000 and the hospital was turned over to citizen control on April 15, 1954. =Boulder City Hospital Auxiliary and Beyond= The Boulder City Hospital Auxiliary was formed by local women to help with hospital work and to raise money to finance operation of the hospital. A fund raising effort begun in 1963 by the Auxiliary has become a Boulder institution. This was the Boulder City Hospital Auxiliary art festival, Art in the Park. The first festival brought in $3,000 and involved fifty artists, including James Swinnerton. On December 8, 1973, a new Boulder City Hospital located on Adams Boulevard opened its doors. The old Six Companies Hospital on the hill fell into disrepair and was condemned. The Sisters of Charity bought the building in 1976 and began renovation in 1980, turning the hospital into a retreat house known as Wellspring. The building was dedicated on April 5, 1981 and a year later was listed on the National Register of Historic Places Services * 25-Bed Acute Care/Swing Bed with telemetry monitors. * 7-Bed Full service ER open 24/7 * Inpatient Geriatric Behavioral Medicine Unit * Skilled Nursing Facility/Long Term Care Unit * Full service Home Health Agency * On-site physical & occupational therapy * Radiology/imaging * Laboratory Testing * Inpatient Dialysis Services * Partial Hospitalization Program Boulder City Hospital is available to provide out- patient services.

Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court dismissed for lack of ripeness a claim in which the plaintiff accused the U.S. Army of alleged unlawful \\"surveillance of lawful citizen political activity.\\" The appellant's specific nature of the harm caused by the surveillance was that it chilled the First Amendment rights of all citizens and undermined that right to express political dissent. Background Arlo Tatum,An obituary for Arlo Tatum appears in The Cornish Quaker, May 2014, giving his vital dates as 21.2.23-2.4.14. A contributed obituary also appears in The Guardian, 7-05-2014. the executive secretary of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, sued Melvin Laird, the Secretary of Defense. Tatum sued after Washington Monthly published an article revealing that US military intelligence units were gathering intelligence on civilians and civil organizations in the US. Opinion The Court was initially divided into three camps. Justices Rehnquist and Powell initially urged the conservatives to determine that the surveillance program was constitutional. However, Chief Justice Burger, and Justices Blackmun and White determined that it would be more controversial for the Court to enter into a political question.\\" After further reflection Powell concluded that it was unwise to rule on the constitutionality of the surveillance program and that the issue was best decided on the principle of ripeness. That is, in the absence of a discernable injury, the issue was too speculative for the Court to rule upon. Burger eventually prevailed on Rehnquist to abandon a concurrence and join with the majority.Joshua E. Kastenberg, Shaping U.S. Military Law: Governing a Constitutional Military. (London: Ashgate Press, 2013), 164-5 The Court determined that the plaintiff's claim was based on the fear that sometime in the future the Army might cause harm with information retrieved during their surveillance, but that there was no present threat. Therefore, the claim was too \\"speculative.\\" Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in dissent, with Mr. Justice Marshall concurring: Participation by Justice Rehnquist The dismissal of the case was made possible by the timely nomination by Richard Nixon of Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist to the Supreme Court. Rehnquist had previously testified to Senator Sam Ervin's committee that there were no \\"serious constitutional problems with respect to collecting data or keeping under surveillance persons who are merely exercising their right of a peaceful assembly or petition to redress a grievance.\\" He further stated that he felt that Laird v. Tatum should be dismissed on the procedural ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Yet he later refused to recuse himself from the case as legal ethicists almost unanimously agreed that he should. After a petition for rehearing was filed based on his participation, Rehnquist issued a memorandumhttps://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/409/824/case.html 409 U.S. 824 (1973) (in chambers) stating that the attack on his impartiality was essentially a criticism of his conservative judicial philosophy, and there had been no actual bias towards the litigant.

During spring, Ramiro I of Aragon besieges Muslim Graus in Zaragozan territory. The Emir al-Muqtadir of Zaragoza leads his army north accompanied by a Castilian contingent under Prince Sancho (the future Sancho II).

It includes Italian knights, Normans (Robert Crespin, Baron of Lower Normandy), Frenchmen (William, Count of Poitiers and Duke of Aquitaine), and Iberians (Bishop of Vic; Count Ermengol II of Urgel). At the start of July the expedition besieges Barbastro in the Muslim Kingdom of Lleida. The Emir of Lleida (the brother of Muktadir of Zaragoza) makes no attempt to relieve the siege and after 40 days the defenders are forced to surrender when a large stone falls from the walls and blocks the only water supply. 50,000 inhabitants are massacred or enslaved.

The governor, Count Ermengol II of Urgel, is killed in a sortie, and a few days later the city falls, whereupon the Iberian and French garrison is put to the sword, thus bringing an end to Pope Alexander II's prototype crusade. At around the same time Emir Al-Muqtadir breaks off relationships with Castile, and Ferdinand I leads a punitive expedition into Zaragozataking Alquezarand then into Valencia. Despite him being a tributary of Castile, Emir Mamun of Toledo leads to force in support of his son-in-law Emir Abd al-Malik.

The army consists of an advance guard of 300 horses and a main body of 1000. *1071Battle of Pedroso (between Braga and the River C√°vado) where Garcia II of Galicia suppresses the rebellion of his Portuguese subjects under Count Nuno Mendes, last count of Portugal of the V√≠mara Peres House. Count Nuno Mendes is killed and Garcia II of Galicia proclaims himself King of Portugal. Sometime after 18 January 1071 and before May, Garcia II of Galicia is captured by his brother Sancho II of Castile (It is unclear if Garcia was captured in open battle at Santar√©m or by trickery). Garcia purchases his release and retires to the court of his tributary Al-Mutamid of Seville. Galicia is divided between his brothers Sancho and Alfonso. *1073The Emir of Granada rejects the Castilian demand for tribute, however, Abbad III al-Mu'tamid, the Emir of Seville offers to pay instead. Consequently, a joint Muslim-Castilian force builds the fortress of Belillos, from which the garrison raid into Granada. *1074Emir Al-Mutamid of Seville drives the Almoravids from Ja√©n. *1075Toledo takes C√≥rdoba from Seville with the help of Castilian troops. *1076Emir Ahmad al-Muqtadir drives Slavs from Denia.

Seville takes Valencia from Toledo. As a result, Al-Qadir of Toledo is forced from the city by a coup and his opponents acknowledge al- Mutawwakil of Badajoz as their new ruler. The Almoravids take Tangier. Ceuta hangs on as the last Zanata outpost because its fleet can supply it from sea. *1079Battle of Cabra. Rodrigo D√≠az, defeats the Emir Abd Allah of Granada, who was helped by the Castilian Count Garc√≠a Ord√≠√±ez. *Battle of Coria. Alfonso VI (already king of Castile and Le√≥n) defeats the Muslim Emir of Badajoz, Al- Mutawwakkil. Al-Mutawwakkil renounces control of Toledo and al-Qadir is reinstated. A Leonese garrison is established at Zorita to the east of Toledo. *1080Ibn Ammar forced to flee Murcia. *1081El Cid, now a mercenary because he had been exiled by Alfonso IV of Castile, enters the service of the Moorish king of the northeast Spanish city of Zaragosa, al-Mu'tamin, and would remain there for his successor, al-Mu'tamin II. *1082Battle of Almenar.

In autumn the Castilians start a loose siege of Toledo. *1085Christians take Salamanca. **Castile under Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, Emperor of all Spains, takes Toledo. *1086Several Muslim Emirs (namely Abbad III al-Mu'tamid) ask the Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashfin for help against Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. In this year Yusuf ibn Tashfin passed the straits to Algeciras and inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the Battle of az-Zallaqah (North of Badajoz). He was debarred from following up his victory by trouble in North Africa which he had to settle in person. **Raymond of Burgundy, son of William I, Count of Burgundy, comes to Iberia for the 1st time to fight against the Moors, bringing with him his younger cousin Henry of Burgundy, grandson of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. **In spring the Castilians besiege Zaragoza, but the siege is called off when the Almoravids land in the south. In June the Almoravids advance guard of 500 men take possession of Algeciras. The remaining 12‚Äì20,000 soon follow. Castilians under Alvar Fa√±ez install al- Qadir as Emir of Valencia. **Almoravids, rampage through parts of Iberia, especially Granada and Lucena. There are persecutions and massacres. The wealthier Jews flee to Christian-held Iberia. **The Christian advance obliges the Muslim kings of Granada, Seville and Badajoz to call to their aid the Almoravids. **Battle of az-Zallaqah: At Sagrajas (Friday 23 October 1086) north-east of Badajoz, the Almoravids (12,000 or 20,000 men) under Yusuf ibn Tashfin and Andalusians (including Kings of Seville, Granada, M√°laga, and Badajoz) defeat a predominantly Leonese-Castilian army (possibly 50-60,000 men including Jews, Aragonese, Italian and French) under Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. The Andalusians encamp separately from the Almoravids. The Christian vanguard (Alvar Fa√±ez) surprise the Andalusian camp before dawn; the men of Seville (Al-Mutamid) hold firm but the remaining Andalusians are chased off by the Aragonese cavalry. The Christian main body then attacks the Almoravids, but are held by the Lamtuma, and then withdraw to their own camp in response to an outflanking move by ibn Tashufin. The Aragonese return to the field, do not like what they see, and start a withdraw which turns to a rout. The Andalusians rally, and the Muslims drive Alfonso to a small hill. Alfonso and 500 knights escape in the night to Toledo. Al-Mutamid proposes that the Christians are pursued and crushed, but Ibn Tashufin retires back to his African domains leaving only 3,000 troops to defend the east of Al-Andalus. Al-Mutamid and the Almoravid generals Sir ibn Abi Bakr and Dawud ibn Aisha are reported to have fought well during the battle. *1087Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile takes the fortress of Aledo in the territory of Murcia, blocking the route from Seville and Granada to the eastern provinces. **After his crushing defeat at Zallaqa, Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile swallows his pride and recalls El Cid from exile. *1088Yusuf ibn Tashfin arrives back in Algeciras (May‚ÄìJune) and is joined by al-Mutamid of Seville and Abd Allah of Granada, plus support from Almer√≠a and Murcia (but not the Emirs). The combined army besieges Aledo for 4 months, but Yusuf ibn Tashfin returns to Africa unsuccessful. *1090Yusuf ibn Tashfin returns to the Peninsula for the third time, takes over the kingdoms of Granada and M√°laga in September and is back in Africa by the end of the year. However, this time his nephew Sir ibn Abi Bakr is left to continue the conquest. Between 30 April 1090 and 8 May 1090, Christian troops enter Santar√©m, Lisbon and Sintra. These were recently ceded by the Al-Mutawwakil of Badajoz in return for protection from the Almoravids. **Yusuf ibn Tashfin, King of the Almoravids, captures Granada. *1091The Almoravids led by Muhammad ibn al-Hajj take C√≥rdoba and the Guadalquivir valley early in the year, and then defeat a Castilian force under √Ålvar F√°√±ez who were attempting to aid Al-Mutamid of Seville. In September Seville surrenders without much of a fight to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Subsequently, other Almoravids armies take Aledo and Almer√≠a. Ronda also falls and the Almoravid commander Garur executes al-Radi (the son al-Mutamid of Seville). **The Taifa of M√©rtola falls to the Almoravids. *1092With El Cid away in Zaragoza, the Valencians under the qadi Ibn Jahhaf and supported by a small Almoravid force, drive the Castilian garrison out and execute their Emir al- Qadir. Ibn Jahhaf promptly sets himself up at Emir and starts negotiating with both El Cid and the Almoravids. **Toledo falls to the Reconquista and will remain in Christian hands thereafter *1093An Almoravid army (Abu Bakr ibn Ibrahiim) approaches Valencia but then retreats without striking a blow. **Almoravid Sir ibn Abi Bakr takes Badajoz and Lisbon. Fall of the Taifa of Badajoz. **El Cid captures Valencia from the Moors, carving out his own kingdom along the Mediterranean that is only nominally subservient to Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. Valencia would be both Christian and Muslim, with adherents of both religions serving in his army. **The Almoravids from Morocco land near Cuarte and lay siege to Valencia with 50,000 men. El Cid, however, breaks the siege and forces the Almoravids to flee ‚Äì the first Christian victory against the hard-fighting Africans. *1095The Almoravids take Santar√©m. *1097El Cid defeats Almoravid (Ali ibn al-Hajj) at the Battle of Bair√©n south of Valencia. **Almoravid (Muhammad ibn al-Hajj) defeat Castilians (Alfonso VI) at Consuegra. El Cid's son, Diego, is one of the dead. **Almoravid (Muhammad ibn Aisha) defeat Castilians (Alva Fa√±ez) at Cuenca before ravaging the lands of Valencia. **Yusuf ibn Tashfin assumes the title of Amir al Muslimin (Prince of the Muslims). *1099The Almoravids besiege El Cid's Valencia, where he dies on 10 July 1099. *1100Molina falls to the Reconquista and will remain in Christian hands thereafter *Beginning of 12th centuryAccording to estimates, the Muslim population in Iberia may have reached 5.5 million, including Arabs, Berber and indigenous converts. *1102The followers of El Cid leave Valencia and the Muslims occupy the Peninsula as far as Zaragoza; Battle of Mollerussa near Lleida on 14 September. **Main Muslim mosque in Toledo converted to a church, Muslim population is sparse. **Christians evacuate Valencia in April‚ÄìMay. Almoravid (Mazdali, presumably ibn Tilankan; Muhammad ibn Fatima) occupy the city. Of the Taifa states only Zaragoza, Majorca, and Albarracin remain independent. *1103Ali, the brother of the Almoravid governor of Granada, Muhammad ibn al-Hajj, is killed in battle with the Castilians near Talavera. *1105The Almohads, founded by Ibn Tumart, began as a religious movement to rid Islam of impurities. Most specifically, the Almohads were opposed to anthropomorphisms which had slipped into Iberian Islam. Ibn Tumart's successor, Abd al-Mu'min, turned the movement against non-Muslims, specifically Jews and Christians. Sweeping across North Africa and into Muslim Iberia, the zealous Almohads initiate riots and persecutions of both Muslims and non-Muslims. In some towns Jews and Christians are given the choice of conversion, exile, or death. *1106Yusuf ibn Tashfin dies and his son, Ali, takes over the Almoravid empire. *1108The Almoravids under Tamim ibn Yusuf ibn Tashfin, the brother of the ruler; another general is Muhammad ibn Fatima, the grandson of Sir ibn Abi Bakr, take the small town of Ucl√©s to the east of Toledo, but a ridge top fortress holds out. Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile sends a relieving army under Alvar Fa√±ez. The Almoravids decisively beat the Castilians and many leaders are killed, including Sancho, Alfonso's only son (by Za√Øda, a Muslim princess) and heir. Subsequently, the Almoravids pretend to withdraw then launch a successful surprise attack on the castle. As a result, the Christians abandon Cuenca and Huete. **Almoravid (Tamim ibn Yusuf ibn Tashfin) storm Talavera on the Tagus to the west of Toledo. The country to the north and south of Toledo is ravaged and the city unsuccessfully besieged for a month. Alvar Fa√±ez leads the defence. Emir Ali ibn Yusuf ibn Tashfin joined this year's Jihad but does not mention him in the actions. *1110Al- Mustain of Zaragoza leads an expedition against the Christians, but is killed at Valtierra. His son, Imad al-Din, fails to establish his rule and the Almoravid (ibn al-Hajj) marches in (30 May 1110). *1111Almoravids led by Sir ibn Abi Bakr occupy Lisbon and Santar√©m in the west. These cities were occupied by the Almoravids in 1094-95 this suggests a fluctuating border in Portugal. **Henry, Count of Portugal grants city rights and privileges to Coimbra and captures Santar√©m to the Moors. *1112By this time the Aragonese have taken Huesca. Almoravid (ibn al-Hajj) raids into Aragonese territory and reaches the foothills of the Pyrenees. *1114A major Almoravid expedition (ibn al-Hajj from Zaragoza and Ibn Aisha of Valencia) raids into Catalonia. The army ravages Christian territory but is ambushed on its return and both Almoravid generals are killed. The Catalans under Count Ramon Berengar III take over the Balearic Islands upon the death of Emir Mubashir ibn Sulayman of Majorca. **The Taifa of Beja and √âvora becomes independent. *1115The new Almoravid governor of Zaragoza, Abu Bakr ibn Ibrahim ibn Tifilwit, lays siege to Barcelona for 20 days. The Almoravids withdraw when Count Ramon Berengar III returns from Majorca. The Almoravid fleet takes the Balearic Islands. The Almoravid general and governor of Granada Mazdali ibn Tilankan dies in battle this year. He led expeditions against the Christians from 1111, so he might have led an expedition separate from those of Abu Bakr and the fleet. His son, Muhammad, governor of C√≥rdoba, also dies in battle this year (against the Castilians), so it may have been the same expedition. *1117Almoravids under Emir Ali ibn Yusuf himself take Coimbra, but abandon the city after a few days. *1118Alfonso I of Aragon takes Saragossa from the Muslims. Settlers in the reconquered no-man's lands of Castile are granted fueros, special rights. **The Aragonese led AlfonsoI the Battler seize Zaragoza and most of the central lands of the Ebro. The siege of Zaragoza lasts from 22 May 1118 to 18 December 1118. The garrison has 20 mangonels and is supported by a determined militia. As a result of a plea for help of 3 December the Almoravid governor of Valencia sends a relief force, but this is too small to help. Lleida only remains in Muslim hands because it is tributary to Barcelona. **Zaragoza falls to the Reconquista and will remain in Christian hands thereafter *1120Alfonso I of Aragon decisively defeats an Almoravid army including many Andalusian volunteers at Cutanda in summer. *1121The Aragonese take Calatayud. The C√≥rdobans rebel against the Almoravids, and drive the governor and his troops from the city. The Emir Ali ibn Yusuf ibn Tashfin leads an army from Africa to suppress the rebellion. The Almoravids besiege the city, and persuade the C√≥rdobans to lay down their arms. *1122Aragonese take Daroca. *1125In September, Alfonso I of Aragon sets out south with an army of 4,000 knights. He travels down the east coast, bypasses the cities and ravages the countryside. He reaches Guadix unopposed in December. *1126The Almoravids deport Christians to Morocco. **Alfonso I of Aragon defeats the Almoravids at Arinzul near Lucena. After symbolically fishing at Motril on the south coast, Alfonso returns home undefeated. *1129Alfonso I of Aragon defeats an Almoravid army led by Ali ibn Majjuz, the governor of Seville deep inside Valencian territory. This is probably at Cullera or Alcal√° near Alzira.

The Almoravid (Governor of Valencia) defeat invading Aragonese and kill Gaston IV of B√©arn of the First Crusade. *1133The Christian militia of Toledo reach the gates of Seville and kill the Almoravid governor (Abu Hafs Umar ibn Ali ibn al-Hajj). Further damage is averted by the intervention of Tashfin ibn Ali ibn Yusuf. *1134Almoravid (Tashfin ibn Ali ibn Yusuf) raids in the Caceres area. **Aragonese Alfonso I of Aragon besiege the small town of Fraga.

Ibn al-Mundhir and Sidray ibn Wazir kill the garrison of Monchique castle, and 70 men take M√©rtola by surprise (12 Aug). Soon after, the Andalusian governor of Niebla, Yusuf ibn Ahmad al-Bitruji declares for the Muridun. The Almoravid Yahya ibn Ali ibn Ghaniya drives the Muridun back from Seville, and afterwards Sidray ibn Wazir splits off from the other Muridun. **The Taifa of M√©rtola and of Silves again become independent. *1145The C√≥rdobans evict the Almoravid governor at the beginning of the year and raise up Hamdin ibn Huhammad ibn Hamdin as Emir. A Zaragozan adventurer in Castilian employ (Sayf al-Dawla ibn Hud al-Mustansir) briefly seizes power from ibn Hamdin in March but flees to the Levante due to popular hostility. Ibn Hamdin returns to power but is soon dispossessed by the Almoravid (Yahya ibn Ali ibn Ghaniya). In March the Andalusian Jund in Valencia raise up the qadi Marwan ibn Abd al-Aziz as Emir. When he cannot pay them they replace him with their own leader Ibn Iyad. **Portugal retakes Leiria from the Moors. **The Taifa of Badajoz again becomes independent and takes the Taifa of M√©rtola. *1146Al-Mustansir accepts the crowns of Valencia and Murcia from the hands of Ibn Iyad.

They could marry only among themselves and were forbidden to engage in large-scale trading, Doubting the sincerity of their conversion, in 1198, he also ordered them to wear a special degrading garb: a blue tunic one cubit long with ridiculously long wide sleeves. The converts were compelled to wear a blue skullcap which fell below their ears in the shape of a donkey's packsaddle, instead of the usual turbans. *1165Maimonides and his family leave Fez. **The Portuguese armies, led by Geraldo the Fearless, retake √âvora from the Moors. *1166The Portuguese armies take Serpa and Moura (in Alentejo) from the Moors. *1168Portuguese frontiersman Geraldo the Fearless goes into the territory of Badajoz. *1169King Afonso I of Portugal grants the Knights Templar one third of all they take from the Moors in Alentejo. **Geraldo the Fearless seizes Badajoz from the Almohads. **King Afonso I of Portugal is wounded by a fall from his horse in Badajoz, and is captured by the competing forces of King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n.

Aftermath (1492‚Äì1614)  *2 January 1492The Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, take over Granada. *1492-1507The remaining Muslims in the Crown of Castile were ordered to become Catholic. King Ferdinand ordered to convert mosques to Christian churches. The king then appeals to the reigning Pope Julius II (nephew of Sixtus IV) to grant the aspirations of these new Christians. This new Christian population, forcibly converted, will come to be known as the Moriscos. Jews who were forcefully converted are known as marranos. Hundreds of thousands of Jews who did not accept conversion were expelled from Spain. They fled with nothing more than the clothes on their backs for the Ottoman Empire, Italy, Egypt and other areas. *1496All Muslims (and Jews) in Portugal were expelled from Portugal. *1499-1501A Muslim rebellion in Granada, following forced conversion of Muslims, contrary to terms of surrender; The rebellion was defeated in 1501. *1501-1502 All Muslims in the Crown of Castile (including the former Emirate of Granada) were forced to convert to Christianity. *1504The Oran fatwa was issued, following the forced conversion of 1501-1502, providing the basis of the secret practice of Islam in Spain. *1516King Charles I, the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, rises to the throne of both Castile and Aragon. With the conquest of Granada and Iberian Navarre, the modern state of Spain is formed. Muslims in the kingdom of Navarre are forced to convert, *15191522Revolt of the Brotherhoods in the Kingdom of Valencia. A middle-class rebellion simultaneously targeting the noble landed class and Muslim peasantry, resulting in the killing and forced conversions of many of the latter, known as Mud√©jars. *1525Muslims in the Crown of Aragon are forced to convert to Christianity as a concession to the old-Christian guilds or German√≠as which had revolted a few years earlier. *1526After convening a council to examine the problem, King Charles I declares that the forced conversions of the Muslims of Valencia and Aragon were valid, because they could have chosen death rather than convert. *1568Rebellion of the Alpujarras. After King Philip II introduces laws prohibiting Moorish culture, the people who had forcefully converted to Christianity in order to remain in Spain, then known as Moriscos, revolt under the leadership of Aben Humeya in Granada. The rebellion is suppressed in 1571 by John of Austria, Philip II's half-brother, and rebels are deported to different parts of the northern half of the Iberian peninsula. *1570 Around 80,000 Moriscos are deported from the Kingdom of Granada resettled in towns and villages throughout Andalusia and Castile. *1609Expulsion of the MoriscosKing Philip III issues the Act of Expulsion for all remaining Moriscos, claiming that they appealed to the Ottoman Empire for military intervention in Spain. They are viewed by some as a fifth column trying to rebuild the Muslim state in the Peninsula. *1614The process of expulsion ends.

A problem with selective disclosure that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to eliminate with Regulation Fair Disclosure(a.k.a.

Part of it was eventually built from New York to Philadelphia by the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad and the Delaware River Branch of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, leased by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway in 1879 and becoming its New York Branch. The line was intended to provide an alternate to the various monopolies that existed along the route, specifically the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies and their Camden and Amboy Railroad, and as such had a long struggle to be built. History In the spring of 1867, Henry Martyn Hamilton began planning for the National Railway between New York and Philadelphia by getting short lines chartered that would end-to-end form the complete route. The first two sections were chartered in New Jersey as the Hamilton Land Improvement Company and Millstone and Trenton Railroad, forming half of the New Jersey route. The Millstone and Trenton Railroad was authorized to build a line from Trenton northeast to Millstone, and the Hamilton Land Improvement Company could build six miles anywhere in the state, which was enough to bridge the gap from Millstone to the Central Railroad of New Jersey at Bound Brook. The first official proposals for the railway came in 1868 at the federal level, with bills in the U.S. House of Representatives for a line between New York and Washington via Easton, Reading and Lancaster. Later proposals concentrated on the New York-Philadelphia section, and were made both at the federal level and in the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On September 21, 1868, the Attleborough Railroad, a short branch line chartered April 15, 1856 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was taken over by Hamilton and renamed to the National Railway, to be part of the through line. The project was first publicized in December of that year. On January 1, 1869 the Camden and Amboy Rail Road's (C&A;) legislated monopoly over New York-Philadelphia railroads in New Jersey expired. However, the C&A; continued to lobby legislators and fight through the courts to prevent the National Railway from being built. In 1870 various bills in New Jersey to allow consolidation of short lines into the Millstone and Trenton Railroad failed. In early 1871 the National Railway bill was introduced once again in the U.S. House, this time by John W. Garrett (president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), who feared the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) proposed lease of the United Companies. It was again defeated. The PRR gained control of the United Companies on May 15, 1871. On March 30, 1871, the German Valley Railroad was chartered in New Jersey, including a Trojan Horse for the National Railway. The governor refused to sign the bill, but the company organized anyway. The same strategy was used on March 19, 1872 with the passage of the Stanhope Railroad. The state clerks were bribed to keep the Trojan Horse off the debated version but include it in the signed version. This was soon discovered, and on August 12 the National Railway was sued for fraud. On February 2, 1873 the New Jersey Court of Chancery ruled that the National Railway had no rights to build in New Jersey. On January 11, 1873 the Excelsior Enterprise Company, a holding company incorporated on May 24, 1871, was renamed the National Company, acquiring the National Railway of Pennsylvania (the original Attleborough Railroad) on January 15. The National Railway gained control of the Stanhope Railroad on January 18, but that soon proved worthless. On March 19, 1873 the New Jersey House of Representatives killed the PRR's opposition bill to create a New Jersey Railway on the land chosen for the National Railway. The PRR and National Railway agreed at that time to support a general incorporation law to break the stalemate, which had been blocked since the 1840s by the Camden and Amboy. That law was passed on April 2, and on April 8 the PRR's company was chartered, running mostly within 100 yards of the planned National Railway. The National Railway of New Jersey was chartered soon after on April 17, as a supplement to the New York and Philadelphia Railroad, chartered 40 minutes after the general incorporation law was passed. Investors were initially scared off from the project, placed under contract on May 31, due to the various scandals involved. The Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad was incorporated in New Jersey on May 12, 1874, to build a railroad from the Delaware River to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) at Bound Brook, along the National Railway's surveyed path. At that time, the North Pennsylvania Railroad took over the National Railway project from Hamilton. On May 14 the North Pennsylvania approved the construction of the Delaware River Branch, splitting from the main line at Jenkintown and running to the Delaware River at Yardley. On May 16 the property of the National Railway was deeded to the D&BB;, including the Stanhope Railroad and the National Company. The Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (D&BB;) and Delaware River Branch opened on May 1, 1876, from the North Pennsylvania Railroad to the CNJ. The D&BB; had trackage rights over the CNJ to their Jersey City terminal. The Trenton Branch of the D&BB; opened in 1877. The original plans carried the National Railway northeast and east past Bound Brook, running north of the CNJ and crossing the New Jersey Rail Road at Waverly to the CNJ terminal. In Pennsylvania, the original plan was southeast of what was built, running directly to the north end of the Junction Railroad in Philadelphia. Part of this route was built in the mid-1900s (decade) as the New York Short Line Railroad, connecting the original Delaware River Branch at Oakford southwest to the Reading's Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad (PN&NY;) at Cheltenham. The Philadelphia and Reading Railway leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad, including the D&BB;, on May 14, 1879. The National Company's charter was later used to form the Reading Company, a holding company for the Reading system. The East Trenton Railroad, incorporated in 1884, was taken over by the D&BB; as a branch in the Trenton area. The Trenton, Lawrenceville and Princeton Railroad, an interurban streetcar line, was taken over at some point as a branch of the East Trenton Railroad for freight. The Port Reading Railroad, opened in 1892, also served as a spur of the D&BB;, running to Port Reading on the Arthur Kill. =Challenges= The United Companies received a charter for the Mercer and Somerset Railway in New Jersey on March 17, 1870 solely to provide a challenge to the planned competitor railroad known as the National Railway. Track began to be laid on January 20, 1871 at the crossing of the National Railway survey in Hopewell. A frog war resulted in early 1876 at the crossing point; a war that was won by the National Railway, thus rendering the Mercer and Somerset Railway redundant and useless. In 1879 or 1880 the Mercer and Somerset Railway was abandoned, having become useless. On October 22, 1873 the PRR leased the PN&NY;, a railroad chartered on November 21, 1860, with the intention to block the National Railway. The line opened as a branch of the Connecting Railroad to Newtown on February 2, 1878, and on November 22, 1879 the North Pennsylvania Railroad began operating it, no longer of use to the PRR. Another challenge was raised as to whether the company could build a bridge over the Delaware River.

The Nordic Museum () is a museum located on Djurg√•rden, an island in central Stockholm, Sweden, dedicated to the cultural history and ethnography of Sweden from the early modern period (in Swedish history, it is said to begin in 1520) to the contemporary period. The museum was founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, who also founded the open-air museum Skansen. For long part of the museum, the institutions were made independent of each other in 1963.  History  The museum was originally (1873) called the Scandinavian Ethnographic Collection (Skandinavisk-etnografiska samlingen), from 1880 the Nordic Museum (Nordiska Museum, now Nordiska museet). When Hazelius established the open-air museum Skansen in 1891, it was the second such museum in the world. The museum building. For the museum, Hazelius bought or got donations of objects like furniture, clothes and toys from all over Sweden and the other Nordic countries; he emphasised the peasant culture, but his successors increasingly started to collect objects reflecting bourgeois and urban lifestyles as well. For Skansen, he collected entire buildings and farms. Although the project did not initially get the government funding he had hoped, Hazelius received widespread support and donations and by 1898, the Society for the promotion of the Nordic Museum (Samfundet f√∂r Nordiska Museets fr√§mjande) had 4,525 members. The Riksdag allocated some money for the museums in 1891 and doubled the amount in 1900, the year before Hazelius died.  Building  Architectural plans of the museum The present building, the design of Isak Gustaf Clason, was completed in 1907 after a 19-year construction process. Originally, it was intended to be a national monument housing the material inheritance of the nation. It was, however, only half-completed for the Stockholm Exposition 1897, and it never was completed to the extent originally planned, three times the actual size. It takes its style from Dutch-influenced Danish Renaissance architecture (i.e. buildings such as Frederiksborg Palace) rather than any specifically Swedish historical models. The core of the ‚Äúcathedralesque‚Äù building is taken up by a huge main hall (126 meters long) passing through all the stories up to the roof and dominated by the enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa, the Swedish so called founder-king. For the construction, brick and granite was used for the walls, while concrete was used for the roof. Collections The museum has over 1.5 million objects in its collections, including buildings such as the Julita farm in S√∂dermanland, Svindersvik in Nacka, Tyres√∂ Palace in Tyres√∂, and the chaplain farm at H√§rkeberga near Enk√∂ping. The museum archive also houses an extensive collection of documents and approximately 6 million photographs dating from the 1840s until today. The museum research library contains 3,800 shelf meters of literature from the 16th century and onward.

The most common is the reaction of ozone and bromide: : Br + ‚Üí BrO Electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis of brine without a membrane operating to form hypochlorite, will also produce bromate when bromide ion is present in the brine solution. Photoactivation (sunlight exposure) will encourage liquid or gaseous bromine to generate bromate in bromide-containing water.

Bromide can be found in sufficient concentrations in fresh water to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 ppb of bromate‚Äîthe maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA. Proposals to reduce bromate formation include: lowering the water pH below 6.0, limiting the doses of ozone, using an alternate water source with a lower bromide concentration, pretreatment with ammonia, and addition of small concentrations of chloramines prior to ozonation.

During its time in operation, it served as a prominent expression of Jewish culture in Russia under Joseph Stalin. Under its founding artistic director, Alexander Granowsky, productions were heavily influenced by the avant-garde trends of Europe and many reflected an expressionistic style. Summertime tours to rural shtetls were extremely popular. At the end of a 1928 tour in Germany, Granowsky defected to the west, and Solomon Mikhoels became artistic director in his place. During Mikhoels' tenure the theatre branched out beyond classic Yiddish theatre productions to include works by Soviet Yiddish writers and William Shakespeare. The theatre continued to operate during World War II in Moscow and, after the evacuation of the city in 1943, in Tashkent. Mikhoels was murdered by the MVD in 1948 and his successor, Benjamin Zuskin, was arrested shortly after. In 1948 the Soviet authorities ordered the theatre to be shut down along with all other Yiddish theatre companies in the Soviet Union.  Founding and early years  It was conceived in 1916 and founded in 1919 by Alexander Granowsky as the Jewish Theatre Workshop in St. Petersburg. Early productions were offered at Maly Theatre, a small, 80-seat space.Posner, D. N. (2015). Moscow State yiddish (Jewish) theatre (GOSET). In S. Williams, The Cambridge encyclopedia of stage actors and acting. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/cupstage/moscow_state_yiddish_jewish_theatre_goset/0 On April 1, 1920, after the capital was changed to Moscow, the company was moved at the request of Anatoly Lunacharsky and became the Moscow State Jewish Theatre. Lunacharsky, the Soviet Minister of Enlightenment at the time, saw the company's potential to spread the Bolshevik message to the Jewish population of Russia and abroad. Photograph of Marc Chagall taken in 1921, the same year he would design the sets for GOSET's first Moscow production, An Evening of Sholem Aleichem Once in Moscow, the company began utilizing a house which was confiscated from a Jewish merchant by the name of L. I. Gurevich who had decided to flee the city around the time of the Russian Revolution. The house, which was built in 1902, consisted of three floors. The second floor featured a large living room that was converted into an auditorium consisting of 90 seats. The kitchen, which was directly adjacent to the new auditorium, was turned into a stage. The first and third floors were reserved for the actors and their families. The house-turned-theatre would later be named Chagall Hall after designer Marc Chagall.Adler, Lois. \\"Alexis Granovsky and the Jewish State Theatre of Moscow.\\" The Drama Review: TDR 24, no. 3 (1980): 27‚Äì42. The design of the foyer, as well as decorations, sets, and costumes for its first production were done by Chagall. However, this would be Chagall's only collaboration with Granowsky, as the two could not get along.Veidlinger (2000), p. 39. January 1, 1921 was the date of GOSET's first performance in Moscow, a production called An Evening of Sholom Aleichem. A year later, the company relocated to a substantially larger auditorium on Malya-Bronnaya Street capable of seating 500 people.  Style and practices  Granowsky was heavily influenced by the avant-garde trends of Europe and many of the company's early productions were examples of an expressionistic style. Archetypes, masks, heavy makeup, Cubism, and the grotesque were common staples of the company's performances in the 1920s. German critic Alfred Kerr wrote that Granowsky's productions were one of a kind and gave them high praise. Kerr, a reviewer with a \\"hard to please\\" reputation, found Granowsky's use of sound, movement, colour, music. and imagery to be both comedic and terrifying. The critic likened the performances to a humanity circus, noting they were without a single dull moment. 1936 photograph of Solomon Mikhoels, actor and artistic director at GOSET Unlike many theatre companies, GOSET preferred to train their own performers rather than hire actors and dancers who were already considered professionals. By educating their own, inexperienced actors, the company hoped to avoid performers with the melodramatic style common in other Yiddish theatre troupes. Vsevolod Meyerhold's \\"biomechanics\\" was the preferred acting technique used by company members under Granowsky's direction. In the summertime, the company organized tours to the rural provinces where Yiddish theatre was actually more popular than in the larger cities. Shtetl residents looked forward to GOSET performances given near their small towns each year.Shternshis, A. (2006). Soviet and Kosher : Jewish Popular Culture in the Soviet Union, 1923‚Äì1939.

One of the best documented tours visited Kiev, Gomel, Odessa, and Kharkov in the summer of 1924 and offered a variety of short sketches called A Carnival of Jewish Comedy in addition to full-length productions, such as The Sorceress, 200,000, and God of Vengeance. At the end of GOSET's European tour that took place throughout the majority of 1928, Granowsky chose to remain in Germany, never returning to the Soviet Union. The decision came after years of conflict with Russian authorities over artistic and financial decisions that Granowsky had made for the company. Soon after the theatre's founding, GOSET had attracted Solomon Mikhoels, who eventually became the leading actor; after Granowsky defected to the West, Mikhoels took over as artistic director. The theatre's repertoire included adaptations of classic works by Sholem Asch, Mendele Mocher Sforim, Sholom Aleichem‚Äîsuch as Tevye the Milkman (also adopted in the West as Fiddler on the Roof)‚Äîand Avrom Goldfaden‚Äîsuch as Bar Kokhba.Moscow State Jewish Theatre.

Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/367659196 Under Mikhoels' direction, the company began to produce works by contemporary Soviet Yiddish writers, such as Shmuel Halkin, Perets Markish, and David Bergelson. Considered their most popular production, in 1935 the theatre produced William Shakespeare's King Lear to great acclaim with Benjamin Zuskin playing the Fool and Mikhoels in the title role of Lear.Slezkine, Y.

Many of the theatre's plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state, but closer readings suggest they actually contained veiled critiques of Stalin's regime, most notably the production of King Lear and the planned production of Richard III. In 1929, in response to a rise in censorship imposed by the government, the company began offering works of Socialist Realism as expected; however, the artists placed Jewish subtext in each production by hiding it within allegory, symbols, and Jewish cultural archetypes. Works of Soviet realism were modestly funded, while works retelling historical Jewish achievements, such as Bar Kochba and the Maccabees, were large-scale productions. The company's production of Boytre the Bandit in 1936 was a Robin Hood-like story written by Moshe Kulbak. The show celebrated the proletariat, and while praised by the press, it was condemned by Lazar Kaganovich, the most prominent Jewish figure in government. Kaganovich chided Mikhoels and the company members of GOSET for not portraying Jewish people in a positive enough light and requested they stick to productions retelling events similar to Bar Kochba. Shorty after, Boytre the Bandit's author, Kulbak, was arrested, prosecuted in a trial for show, and executed. In October 1936, the Committee of Artistic Affairs informed Mikhoels that he must move away from Granowsky's style of \\"formalism\\" (defined as a \\"departure from reality\\") and limit the company's productions to realistic portrayals of Jewish history, Jewish folklore, or Soviet Jewry.

Despite the uncertainty of government reactions in the late 1930s, Mikhoels found himself in a position to aid Stalin during World War II by organizing a Jewish resistance movement, the aim of which was to mobilize the world's Jewish population in the struggle against fascism. During the war, GOSET's performances were often interrupted by air-raid sirens that caused both performers and audiences to run for cover underground. Despite this, the company continuously endeavored to offer entertainment to keep the population of Moscow calm and give them an escape from hardships. In October 1941, GOSET was officially restructured by the Committee of Artistic Affairs and its planned productions were replaced by Soviet wartime propaganda pieces. After the evacuation of Moscow, most company members took refuge in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where they continued to present performances to the Uzbek people. The company returned to Moscow in late 1943. After World War II, the rise of antisemitism in Russia caused people once referred to as \\"Brother Jew\\" to be labeled \\"Rootless Cosmopolitan\\", and members of government began to interpret Mikhoels' artistic choices as proof of Jewish nationalism. In January 1948, Mikhoels was murdered by the MVD, and his death was made to look like a car accident. Afterwards, Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, would attribute his murder directly to her father's paranoia of Zionist plots.Azadovskii, Konstantin and Boris Egorov, \\"From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism: Stalin and the Impact of the 'Anti-Cosmopolitan' Campaigns on Soviet Culture,\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 4(1), 2002, 66‚Äì80. After Mikhoels' death, Benjamin Zuskin took became the company's artistic director. Months later, Zuskin was arrested and the theatre received orders to shut down along with all other Yiddish theatre companies in the Soviet Union. In addition, all members of the Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee (also formerly headed by Mikhoels) were arrested. Zuskin was one of at least thirteen prominent Soviet Yiddish artists executed on August 12, 1952 in the event known as \\"The Night of the Murdered Poets\\" (\\"–ù–æ—á—å –∫–∞–∑–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–≤\\"). GOSET may be referred to today as the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, State Yiddish Theatre, Yiddish Chamber Theatre, Yiddish Worker's Theatre, Jewish State Chamber Theatre, State Yiddish Chamber Theatre, or the Yiddish Theatre-Studio.

The league was formalized in 1985. History Cricket has been played in the United States of America since the early 1700s . Cricket has only been played in Colorado since the mid-1800 . Colorado cricketers Colin McHattie (Secretary), C. Srinivasan (Treasurer) and Dan Ruparel (President), founded what is now known as the Colorado Cricket League. Ruparel has remained active with the league and the Littleton Cricket Club, McHattie is in Texas and Srinivasan in India. They received endorsements from the five teams that played cricket at that time: The Boulder Cricket Club, The Colorado Cricket Club, The Denver Cricket club, The International Cricket Club of CSU, and The Pakistan Cricket Club. None of these clubs are in existence today, except the CSU Cricket Club (see below) has the most direct roots to its predecessor. Games were initially played on grassy pitches, which were often uncut with a jute mat laid on top. In 1994 the league switched to concrete-based, carpeted wickets. Neutral umpires were introduced in 1985. The catalyst that spurred the creation of the Colorado cricket League in 1985 was for hope and expectation to have our players to try out for the US National Cricket team by participating in tournaments in Kansas and Oklahoma, which were part of the USACA's [www.USACA.org] former Central Zone. Unfortunately due to politics the trials were a farce. A year later, the Colorado cricket League pulled out of the USACA in protest, leading a number other leagues to do the same for the same reason - politics. Prior to 1985, the \\"league\\" was comprised on 5 team from Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Games were scheduled by the team captains calling each other to schedule games for the following weekend. If the team was busy with a game with another team or with a community social event, then a verbal commitment was made to play the next available weekend. The captain would then call a representative of another side to get a match scheduled for that weekend. If it worked, a match was played, otherwise the team would end up either playing an intra-squad practice or game and wait for the following weekend. Upon formalizing the League, schedules were drawn up, standards were created where initially 35 over per inning matches were played. This was changed to 35 in the second year (1986); and in 1992, 40 overs per inning was adopted. One other important modification was adopted - that of neutral umpires. With 5 teams in the league, there was always an idle side. The idle team were responsible to send their more senior players, who it was expected, knew the rules the best, to umpire the matches. Over the years since then the league has made major strides - hosting invitationals, festivals and tournaments and has played in tournaments in California, Utah, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma. =Championships= CCL participates in the Central Western region's annual championship. In 2004 CCL won the plate trophy. In 2006 CCL took second place. Afan Sheriff represented Central West and was declared MVP of the western conference tournament. Organization In 1985 CCL was officially incorporated as a non-profit organization. The league runs a cricket tournament which takes place from May to September each year and involves approximately 300 players. CCL has introduced a pilot program called \\"tennis ball cricket\\", intended to attract teams from throughout Colorado to increase the league's size to 500 players. Although, not officially associated with the Colorado Cricket League, Colorado also has an indoor cricket league: The Colorado Indoor Cricket Association and an International Cricket Council (ICC) award winning Junior Schools program: The Colorado Junior Cricket Association [www.juniorcricket.com]. =Clubs and teams= The CCL is made up of eight clubs and nine teams. * Boulder Cricket Club * Coal Creek Cricket Club * Colorado Springs Cricket Club * Colorado Crossbats * Front Range Cricket Club * Denver Sluggers Cricket Club * Fort Collins Cricket Club * Littleton Cricket Club * Royal Bengal Cricket Club * University of New Mexico at Albuquerque Cricket Club * Wyoming Cricket Club =Officers, 2020= * President: [King Sinzu Chase(CMG)] * Vice President: [Sam Chase (CMG)] * Secretary: [Haywhay Chase (CMG)] * Treasurer: Satyanarayana Pushadapu (CCCC) Tennis Cricket Mascarenhas Raymond is credited for being the person to introduce the TennisBall Cricket League in CCL in 2005 that so many players enjoy till today.

Rockers, the team: http://tennis.coloradocricket.org/teams.php?teams=23&ccl;_mode=1 In 2010, Orchard won the tournament, while Spartans were runners up. Website In 2004 two of the league's members, Michael Doig and Jarrar Jaffari, recognized the need for a central repository for tracking schedules, scorecards, standings, teams and players. Realizing that the web would be most efficient they set about programming and designing the CCL Official Website, driven by the popular PHP language and MYSQL database. The idea was to design a website that would allow a small group of cricket enthusiasts to easily manage a dynamic cricketing portal. This was achieved due to the steadfast dedication of Doig and Jaffari. Today the CCL boasts detailed news analysis and statistics of each of its games dating well back into the 1990s. It can be proud that it stands strong and well above many cricketing leagues on the planet for its comprehensive coverage and passion.

Adolfo Calero Portocarrero (December 22, 1931 - June 2, 2012) was a Nicaraguan businessman and the leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest rebel group of the Contras, opposing the Sandinista government. Calero was responsible for managing the bank accounts into which money was deposited and then used to buy supplies and arms for the Contras. He was brought to testify at hearings of the US Congress in May 1987. Early years Calero was born on December 22, 1931 in Managua to Adolfo Calero Orozco (1899‚Äì1980) and Mar√≠a Portocarrero (1911‚Äì1944), who had married in 1927. The oldest of four children, he studied in the United States, graduating from University of Notre Dame in 1953 and Syracuse University. In Managua, he managed the Coca-Cola bottling plant. Calero was associated with the Conservative Party of Nicaragua. From 1963, he was a CIA information source. Before the 1979 overthrow of the government of Anastasio Somoza, he had been briefly imprisoned, which gave credibility to his claims to have opposed Somoza as well as the Sandinistas. Contra leader In early 1983, he joined the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). By October he became its president, but many observers wondered about his real power because of the political wing's weak control over the military wing. In a bid to unify contra factions and win aid from the US Congress, he became a member of the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) triumvirate with Alfonso Robelo and Arturo Cruz. Calero controlled the FDN through his deputy, Aristides S√°nchez, and the contras' military commander, Enrique Berm√∫dez, an alliance so tight that it was dubbed the \\"Iron Triangle.\\" However, there were tensions below the surface. After the Sapoa ceasefire, Calero exploited discontent with Bermudez among the FDN's field commanders in an effort to push him out. Heavy-handed intervention by the CIA helped to crush that effort. Later, however, other commanders, with the blessing of the US State Department, ousted both their political and military leadership. On July 26, 2011, he published his book \\"Cronicas de un Contra\\", which narrates his participation during the 1980s in Nicaragua.  Personal life  Calero married Maria Ernestina Lacayo on December 7, 1957. The couple had two children, Myriam (b. 1958) and Adolfo (1960‚Äì1994). Calero has three grandchildren. He had three younger siblings: Myriam (b. 1933-2018) Mario (1935‚Äì1993) and Martha (b. 1943). Death Calero died in Managua on June 2, 2012 after complications from pneumonia and kidney failure.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18312346 He is survived by his wife, daughter, three grandchildren, and two sisters. In popular culture In the 2017 film American Made, he was portrayed by Daniel Lugo.

The effect was caused by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which led Brazil to increase interest rates and to institute spending cuts and tax increases in an attempt to maintain the value of its currency.\\"Bearing the Burden: The Impact of Global Financial Crisis on Workers and Alternative Agendas for the IMF and Other Institutions\\", Institute for Policy Studies, April 2000. These measures failed to produce the intended effect and the Brazilian government floated its currency against the US dollar, which led to the dramatic decrease in its value. The devaluation also precipitated fears that the ongoing economic crisis in Asia would spread to South America, as many South American countries were heavily dependent on industrial exports from Brazil. These fears resulted in the Brazilian government adopting an austerity program in order to receive a $41.5 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund and other world lenders. By the end of 1999 the effect was waning and the Brazilian economy was beginning to recover. However, unemployment was only slightly lower than before the effect, and remained more than twice as high as it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Removed from office following the failed 1965 coup, he spent 29 years in prison. The spelling \\"Subandrio\\" has been official in Indonesia since 1947 but the older spelling Soebandrio is still sometimes used. Early career West New Guinea to Indonesian control on 1 May 1963left Subandrio was born in Malang, East Java, and educated at the Sekolah Tinggi Kedokteran Jakarta (GHS) in Jakarta. As a medical student he was active in the movement for independence. During World War II, while practicing medicine, he worked with anti-Japanese resistance forces. After the war he was appointed secretary- general of the information ministry. After 1945 Subandrio became a supporter of the nationalist leader Sukarno, and was sent as Sukarno's special envoy in Europe, establishing an information office in London in 1947. From 1954 to 1956, he was ambassador to the Soviet Union. During this time he developed strong left wing views, although he was never a Communist as later alleged. Cabinet minister In 1956 Sukarno recalled him to Jakarta to become secretary-general of the foreign ministry, and then Foreign Minister. In 1960 he was also made Second Deputy Prime Minister, and in 1962 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Economic Relations. He held all three posts, and also acted as intelligence chief, until 1966. Subandrio was the main architect of Indonesia's left-wing foreign policy during this period, including the alliance with the People's Republic of China and the policy of \\"Confrontation\\" with Malaysia, which created great hostility between Indonesia and the western powers, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. He was heavily involved in the Sunda Straits Crisis of 1964, when the British aircraft carrier HMS Victorious passed through Indonesian waters without proper approval. Downfall of Sukarno On 30 September 1965 a group of army officers, allegedly supported by the powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), attacked a part of the Army leadership that was supposedly plotting to overthrow Sukarno. Six Army generals were killed but the alleged \\"coup attempt\\" failed. In the resulting anti-Communist backlash the conservative General Suharto took control of the government. Sukarno tried to retain Subandrio in the cabinet, but in 1966 he was forced to agree to his dismissal. Subandrio was sentenced to death by the Extraordinary Military Court on charges of being involved in the \\"30 September Movement,\\" although there was no real evidence that Subandrio knew of the plot in advance or played any part in it (he was in Sumatra at the time* Hughes, John (2002), The End of Sukarno ‚Äì A Coup that Misfired: A Purge that Ran Wild, Archipelago Press, p.19, ). This sentence was afterwards reduced to life imprisonment upon the request of the British government on behalf of Queen Elizabeth, as it was remembered that Subandrio was Indonesia's first envoy to the U.K. He remained in prison until 1995, when he was released due to ill health. He died in Jakarta in 2004. References Further reading * Segeh, Sjafri.(1966) Soebandrio, Durno terbesar abad ke-XX Padang : Trimuf.

The Man Who Saw Tomorrow is narrated (some might say \\"hosted\\") by Orson Welles. The film depicts many of Nostradamus' predictions as evidence of Nostradamus' predicting ability, though as with other works, nothing is offered which conclusively proves his accuracy. The last quarter of the film discusses Nostradamus' supposed prediction for the then future of the 1980s, 1990s and beyond. There are no scientifically testable predictions directly included in this film, only suggestions and allusions. The film was produced and directed by Paul Drane for Australian Seven television network. It was hosted by actor John Waters. It set a ratings record, leading to a repeat broadcast two weeks later.  Welles' view  Welles, though he agreed to host the film, was not a believer in the subject matter presented. Welles' main objection to the generally accepted translations of Nostradamus' quatrains (so called because Nostradamus organized all his works into a series of four lined prose, which were then collected into \\"centuries\\", or groups of 100 such works) relates in part to the translation efforts. While many skilled linguists have worked on the problem of translating the works of Nostradamus, all have struggled with the format the author used. Nostradamus lived and wrote during a period of political and religious censorship. Because of this it is said he disguised his writings not only with somewhat cryptic language, but in four different languages (Latin, French, Italian and Greek). Not content with such obfuscation, Nostradamus is also said to have used anagrams to further confuse potential inquisitors (particularly with respect to names and places). Welles himself completely rejected the central theme of the film after having made it. It is not known if Welles was contractually obligated to narrate the film, or if he simply grew disenchanted with its subject matter and presentation after completing it. Perhaps Welles' most public criticism of the subject matter of the film occurred during a guest appearance on an early 1980s episode of The Merv Griffin Show; \\"One might as well make predictions based on random passages from the phone book\\", he offered when asked about the film, before moving on to discuss other projects more interesting to him personally.  Alleged predictions of Nostradamus in The Man Who Saw Tomorrow  * The accidental death of King Henry II of France (1559). * The French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799). * The rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte (1799‚Äì1815). * The American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783). * The assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (1865). * The rise and fall of Adolf Hitler (1933‚Äì1945). * World War II (1939‚Äì1945). * The Holocaust. * The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). * A conspiracy to assassinate U.S. President John F. Kennedy (1963). * The assassination of Robert F. Kennedy (1968). * Islamic Revolution of Iran (1979). * The 1980s could be the time for Ted Kennedy to run to the U.S. presidency, after the Chappaquiddick incident (1969). Eventually, Kennedy ran for the Presidency in 1980, when he tried to defeat incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the Democratic Party primaries. * Inventions and technological advances. * The end of the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States (\\"One day, the two great masters would be friends...The eastern ruler would be vanquished\\" but which could just as easily have referred to the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire). * A major earthquake striking Los Angeles in May 1988. * A \\"King of Terror\\", wearing a blue turban, described as \\"the terror of mankind\\", would rise to power from Greater Arabia during the late 1990s, wage war around the world and spread the influence of Islamic fundamentalism, along with the decreasing influence of Christianity. Nostradamus claims that the \\"King of Terror\\" would form an alliance with Russia. According to Nostradamus, the \\"King of Terror\\" and Russia would wage World War III against the West (United States, United Kingdom and France), starting with a nuclear strike on New York City (\\"the sky will burn at 45 degrees, fire approaches the great new city\\"). Nostradamus claims that World War III would last about 27 years, and the war would destroy cities and kill millions. The \\"King of Terror\\" would eventually be defeated himself, after the two farthest northern neighbors US (Eagle) and Russia (Bear) form an alliance and destroy \\"King of Terror\\". * After World War III, there will be a \\"peace of a thousand years\\".  1991 remake  On February 20, 1991, during the Gulf War, NBC aired a remake of this film, hosted and narrated by Charlton Heston. Much of the same footage, voice acting, and musical score was retained from the original movie. Much of Heston's narration constituted a verbatim reprise of Welles' original presentation. There were, however, some significant differences between the 1991 remake and the original film: * Much of the religious content was omitted. The three Antichrists became three \\"great despotic tyrants\\", and the religious dimensions of the third tyrant's war were eliminated. * The remake was shortened to one hour, leading to the omission of all references to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, Francisco Franco, the Edward VIII abdication crisis, Jeanne Dixon, and to allegations surrounding the disinterment of Nostradamus in 1791. Discussion of the remaining predictions was abridged. * As Ted Kennedy had failed in his 1980 Presidential bid and did not run for the Presidency in 1984, or any time thereafter, references to his possible Presidency were eliminated. * The third tyrant's war, and the tragedies preceding that war, were made to seem less severe than in Welles' original documentary. * Saddam Hussein was implied to be the third tyrant. * The remake discussed the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, alleging that this earthquake may have been the one predicted in Welles' movie. * Discussion of Nostradamus' alleged predictions was rearranged, in that the remake included discussion of Napoleon with the other two tyrants, rather than with the French Revolution. * References to the end of the world were eliminated. The nature of the overall changes served the purpose of brevity, reducing an eighty-eight-minute film to a one-hour television broadcast, including commercial interruptions. Moreover, the predictions relating to the third tyrant were adapted to serve U.S. propaganda purposes during the then-occurring Gulf War. The severity of the natural disasters preceding the tyrant's emergence was reduced, as a worldwide famine leading to cannibalism, and earthquakes and flooding in various European cities, had clearly not taken place. Similarly, the severity of the third tyrant's war was diminished, omitting references to the conquest of Europe, nuclear war, and the destruction of New York City, as well as the prediction that the war would begin in 1994. Significantly, to avoid offence to Muslims, negative references to Islam, and references to the religious nature of the tyrant (calling him an Antichrist and a \\"strong master of Mohammedan law\\") and his war were eliminated, as well as the portrayal of the then-current Gulf conflict as a religious war. Although David L. Wolper was the executive producer of The Man Who Saw Tomorrow and arranged for the film to be re-edited into the 1991 television special, he was quoted as saying before the broadcast, \\"If you're asking me if I believe any of this ... the answer is a most definite 'no.'\\"  Reception  Roger Ebert noted in March 1988 that Californians were renting the film based on its prediction of an earthquake in May, 2 months later. \\"Sales clerks at the busy 20/20 Video Store on La Cienega Boulevard told me the tape is renting like crazy, and the overnight fee has been raised to $6, reflecting the demand. Spokesmen for Warner Bros Home Video confirm that \\"The Man Who Foretold the Future\\" has emerged as a surprise hit from their backlist.\\" The San Bernardino Sun ran a piece that quoted, \\"\\"We have a couple of copies, and it's always gone. It's a non-stop rental,\\" said Keith Cramer, assistant manager at the Wherehouse on Highland Avenue in San Bernardino. \\"Customers bringing it back say it's a pretty interesting movie. I've had a couple of people go so far as to say they're planning on it (the earthquake). One person even joked they were planning their vacation so they'd be in Arizona then.\\"\\" In April 1988, the Los Angeles Journal, referring to earthquake predictions, quoted David Wolper as joking \\"If the quake does happen, we'll sell a lot more copies, maybe enough to rebuild my house.\\" Regarding the 1991 edit, Variety TV wrote \\"[T]he special makes a halfhearted effort to cram current events in the Persian Gulf into Nostradamus' prediction of a third great tyrant (after Napoleon and Hitler). While Saddam Hussein stands a fair chance of wreaking the kind of global havoc supposedly forecast according to the earlier film, this special ignores some of the more apocalyptic scenarios of that '81 pic to focus unconvincingly on events to date. As is so often the case, Nostradamus' obscure quatrains are easily manipulated to suit the needs of the manipulators.\\" References  External links  * *AVClub, Orson Welles spouts authoritative nonsense in The Man Who Saw Tomorrow *The Prophecies of Nostradamus (1979) *The Man Who Saw Tomorrow (1981), VHS copy *The Man Who Saw Tomorrow (1991), NBC version Category:1981 films Category:Nostradamus Category:Documentary films about the paranormal Category:Films directed by Robert Guenette Category:The Wolper Organization films ","title":"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow"},{"id":"2141682","text":"Stefanie is the seventh studio album by Singaporean singer Stefanie Sun (), released on 29 October 2004 by Warner Music Taiwan.

It forms the southern buttress of Boulder Pass. The mountain was named in 1908 by Arthur O. Wheeler, founding member of the Alpine Club of Canada (AAC), as it resembled a redoubt (an outer military defense). The mountain can be climbed on a moderate to difficult scrambling route on the northwestern ridge. Like other mountains in Banff Park, it is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, the mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C.

Gameplay In the game, the player pilots a starship called the Final Star, while shooting various enemies and destroying enemy structures for points. Unlike later vertical scrolling shooters, like Toaplan's Twin Cobra, the Final Star had only two levels of weapon power, and no secondary weapons like missiles and/or bombs. Each stage in the game was named after a letter of the Greek alphabet. In certain versions of the game, there is an additional level called \\"Infinity\\" (represented by the infinity symbol) which occurs after Omega, after which the game repeats indefinitely. In the NES version, after defeating the Omega target, the player can see a black screen with Tecmo's logo, announcing the future release of the sequel Super Star Force. After that, the infinity target becomes available and the game repeats the same level and boss without increasing the difficulty.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Star Force on their December 1, 1984 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy =Sequels= *Super Star Force: Jik≈´reki no Himitsu, released in 1986 for the Japanese Nintendo Famicom. *Final Star Force, released for arcades in 1992. =Ports and related releases= Star Force was ported and published in 1985 by Hudson Soft to both the MSX home computer and the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan. The North American version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was published in 1987 by Tecmo. Although the NES version is the same Hudson port that had been released for the Famicom in Japan, Tecmo made alterations to the graphics, music, and control, and increased the difficulty of the game. Also, despite the U.S. arcade version being titled Mega Force, Tecmo decided to release the NES version under the original name of Star Force. Star Force was also ported to the SG-1000 by Sega, X68000 by Dempa Shimbunsha and mobile phones by Tecmo. In 1995, along with two other NES shooters, the Famicom version of Star Force was remade by Hudson Soft with minimal upgrades for the Super Famicom as part of the Japan-only release of the Caravan Shooting Collection. The same version was also included in Hudson's compilation of NES shooters in 2006 in Hudson Best Collection Vol. 5. The original arcade version was later added to the compilation titled Tecmo Classic Arcade, which was released for the Xbox. In 2009, the arcade version was made available for download on the Wii Virtual Console for 500 Wii Points as one of the four initial offerings for the \\"Virtual Console Arcade\\" category of the Wii Shop Channel (the other three being Gaplus, Mappy, and The Tower of Druaga from Namco). =Star Soldier= In 1986, Hudson Soft released the shoot 'em up game Star Soldier, which is considered a spiritual successor to Star Force.http://hg101.kontek.net/starsoldier/starsoldier.htm The game spawned numerous sequels.

Personal life Salmenhaara was born in Helsinki, Finland, and married Anja Kosonen in 1961. They had two sons, but divorced in 1978. Salmenhaara died in Helsinki on March 19, 2002. Career Salmenhaara studied composition with Joonas Kokkonen at the Sibelius Academy until 1963, and then continued his studies with Gy√∂rgy Ligeti in Vienna. Salmenhaara then studied musicology, aesthetics and theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and earned his PhD in 1970 with a doctoral thesis about the works of the composer Ligeti. He served as lecturer (1966‚Äì1975) and associate professor (1975‚Äì2002) of musicology at the University of Helsinki and was also the leading writer on classical music in Finland. In addition, he served as chairman of the Society of Finnish Composers (1974‚Äì1976) and of the Association of Finnish Symphony Orchestras (1974‚Äì1978). Works Prior to studying with Kokkonen, Salmenhaara had already written several tonal pieces, including the 17 Small Pieces for Piano (1957‚Äì1960). In the early 1960s, he was associated with the modernist Finnish Musical Youth. Beginning in the 1970s, Salmenhaara's works began to be characterized by frequent repetition of triadic motives with gradual changes in harmony. Although this led to his being linked to the movement in music known as minimalism, Salmenhaara nonetheless denied this connection. Like the works of the Dutch minimalist composer Simeon ten Holt, Salmenhaara's works from this period utilize a musical language closely related to that of the Romantic period of classical music, giving his music a decidedly European aesthetic. Salmenhaara's compositions include several symphonic works, chamber music pieces, choral works, songs for solo instrument, and vocal arts songs. He also wrote one opera, Portugalin nainen (The Portuguese Woman) which premiered at the Suomen Kansallisooppera in February 1976. Salmenhaara's published writings include a textbook on music theory, a history of 20th-century music, monographs on Ligeti, Jean Sibelius's Tapiola and the Brahms symphonies, biographies of Jean Sibelius and Leevi Madetoja, and a history of the Society of Finnish Composers. He also contributed to Erik W. Tawaststjerna's comprehensive biography of Sibelius. His most significant literary work was his contribution to a four-volume history of Finnish music (published in 1995‚Äì1996), writing about the period from the Romantic era to the Second World War. In addition, from 1963 to 1973, he served as a critic for the leading Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.  Discography  (selection) * Suomi-Finland, La Fille en mini-jupe, Adagietto, Le bateau ivre.

This has been well described in Drosophila with respect to eye color and is known as position effect variegation (PEV). The phenotype is well characterised by unstable expression of a gene that results in the red eye coloration. In the mutant flies the eyes typically have a mottled appearance of white and red sectors. These phenotypes are often due to a chromosomal translocation such that the color gene is now close to a region of heterochromatin. The heterochromatin can spread stochastically and switch off the color gene resulting in the white eye sectors. Position effect is also used to describe the variation of expression exhibited by identical transgenes that insert into different regions of a genome. In this case the difference in expression is often due to enhancers that regulate neighboring genes. These local enhancers can also affect the expression pattern of the transgene. Since each transgenic organism has the transgene in a different location each transgenic organism has the potential for a unique expression pattern.

Preferred share of the International Mercantile Marine Company, issued 21. November 1922 The International Mercantile Marine Company, originally the International Navigation Company, was a trust formed in the early twentieth century as an attempt by J.P. Morgan to monopolize the shipping trade. IMM was founded by shipping magnates Clement Griscom of the American Line and Red Star Line, Bernard N. Baker of the Atlantic Transport Line, J. Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line, and John Ellerman of the Leyland Line. The Dominion Line was also amalgamated. The project was bankrolled by J.P. Morgan & Co., led by financier J. P. Morgan. The company also had working profit-sharing relationships with the German Hamburg-Amerika and the North German Lloyd lines. The trust caused great concern in the British shipping industry and led directly to the British government's subsidy of the Cunard Line's new ships RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania in an effort to compete. IMM was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMM's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. Analysis of financial records shows that IMM was overleveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow that caused it to default on bond interest payments in late 1914. As a result, a \\"friendly\\" receivership was put in effect in 1915, which allowed IMM to reorganize its finances; it emerged from the receivership in 1916.The New York Times, 4 April 1915; IMM 1916 Annual Report.

History =Founding of the company= As the shipping industry prospered in the late 19th century, some sought to create a trust that would monopolize U.S. shipping companies. However, all negotiations in this regard in the 1890s fell short. The intervention of John Pierpont Morgan, one of the richest men in the world, would change that.

Retrieved 30 December 2009 On 1 October 1902, JP Morgan & Co. announced the founding of the International Mercantile Marine Company, more commonly called IMM. (Constituent elements of IMM, including INC (chartered in 1871),N.R.P. Bonsor, North Atlantic Seaway, vol. 2 (1978), p. 829 had however been operating for many years already.) IMM was incorporated in New Jersey. =Golden age= The Regina sailed for the Dominion Line and White Star Line before being transferred to the Red Star Line under the name of Westernland. Morgan's role evolved over the years. Being American, he could not directly own British ships, but he could own the company that owned the ships. In 1902, the IMM carried 64,738 passengers, a total buoyed by high immigration to the United States. The IMM had signed a partnership with the two most important German shipping companies, Norddeutscher Lloyd and HAPAG, which carried a total of 66,838 passengers. The German-Morgan agreement, signed in New York on 20 February 1902,Central planks of the agreement included dividend-sharing, route-allocation, and joint committee to oversee the agreement, and suspension in the event of war. A contemporaneous side deal authorized the subsequent acquisition by HAPAG, NDL and IMM of a controlling interest in the Holland- America line (but without the direct advance knowledge of Holland-America's management). The German Accession,\\" chapter 3 in Vale, pp. 63-101, Annual Report of the Commissioner of Navigation [U.S.], 1902, pp. 395-99, Navin and Sears, pp. 308-12 was a key step in the formation of what was to become the IMM, but did not fully address long-standing competitive friction between and amongst the major German and British transatlantic shipping companies. Responses in the United Kingdom helped intensify these rivalries. Cunard Line, one of the British shipping companies with independent significance, received grants from the British government for the construction of two great ocean liners, the Lusitania and the Mauretania, which were placed into service in late 1907. The competitive response from the IMM group came in 1908 when Harland & Wolff was authorized to build the White Star Line's Olympic class ocean liner trio: , , and ., J.H. Isherwood, \\"The Great Olympic,\\" Sea Breezes 21 (1956), p. 101 Since 1902, IMM had an agreement with James Pirrie, chairman of Harland & Wolff and member of the management of the White Star Line, stating that the vessels of the company will be built by Harland & Wolff for all the time. Ships of the company were also shifting from one company to another, like the Belgic, built for the White Star Line, which was transferred to the service of the Red Star Line under the name , or the Regina became the Westernland.Regina/Westernland, Great Ships. Retrieved 7 February 2010 This allowed the IMM to schedule a ship each day from the United Kingdom, and passengers to change their tickets to a position equivalent to another vessel of the company. Baker retired from the direction of the Atlantic Transport Line shortly after its integration with the IMM, and was replaced by Philip Franklin. He later became vice president of IMM, while Griscom was replaced as president by Joseph Bruce Ismay in 1904 (who was also president of the White Star Line). =Decline= The sinking of the Titanic was one of the causes of the decline of IMM. The early 1910s marked a turning point for the IMM. Indeed, on 15 April 1912, the Titanic, flagship of its fleet, sank during her maiden voyage. Besides the financial and human losses, the sinking had repercussions on the organization of the trust. Through the American commission of inquiry devoted to the sinking, Senator William Alden Smith openly attacked the very principle of the company and Morgan. As had been arranged before Titanic sank, J. Bruce Ismay retired as president of IMM in 1913 and was succeeded by Harold SandersonWilton Oldham: \\"The Ismay Line\\". Morgan died on 31 March 1913. After the 1915-16 receivership, Sanderson was succeeded as president by Franklin, who had been the receiver.IMM 1916 Annual Report However, the sinking of the Titanic did not bring about the end of the IMM. Although theoretically powerful due to its continued influence with some of the top American, British, and German shipping companies, the overseeing company never managed to overcome its own financial problems, nor dominate the bulk of the North Atlantic shipping trade, and was therefore not as successful as expected. The company went into receivership in 1915 and was placed in the hands of Franklin, who managed to save it. In the late 1920s, he received grants from the government to American ships (built in the United States or flying the flag) and in 1926 it sold the White Star Line to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company for ¬£7 million, of which ¬£2.35 million was still unpaid when the Royal Mail Group, which was overleveraged and undercapitalized, collapsed in the early 1930s.Green and Moss: \\"A Business of National Importance\\" In 1930, IMM possessed 30 vessels. There were 19 in 1933 and only 11 by 1935. The ailing company merged with the Roosevelt Steamship Company, parent company of the Roosevelt Line, in 1931 to form Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine Company (RIMM). Later in 1931, RIMM acquired the financially troubled United States Lines and began consolidating its operations under that brand. The Atlantic Transport Line was dissolved in late 1931 and its ships were distributed throughout RIMM's remaining divisions. The American Line was merged into United States Lines in 1932, the Red Star Line was sold to Arnold Bernstein in 1934, Baltimore Mail Line merged into United States Lines in 1937, the Panama Pacific Line was dissolved in 1938 and its ships divested, and American Merchant Line was merged into United States Lines in 1938. Finally, the Roosevelt Line was merged into United States Lines in 1940, leaving that company as RIMM's only remaining business. RIMM changed its name to United States Lines Inc. in 1943, recasting itself as a smaller company focused exclusively on transatlantic routes under a single brand. Some businesses of the modern shipping industry still regard IMM as an early attempt at the corporate ownership of several companies under a single trust; the kind of large overseeing companies that dominate much of the maritime shipping world today.

It was founded in 1907 in Brenham, Texas. For much of its early history, the company manufactured both ice cream and butter locally. In the mid-20th century, it abandoned butter production and expanded to the entire state of Texas and soon much of the Southern United States. The company's corporate headquarters are located at the \\"Little Creamery\\" in Brenham, Texas. Since 1919, it has been in the hands of the Kruse family. As of 2015, Blue Bell is the number two selling ice cream manufacturer in the United States. History A restored delivery truck at the Brenham factory. Life size logo at Blue Bell Creameries in Brenham We Eat All We Can and Sell the Rest The company has its roots in the Brenham Creamery Company, which opened in 1907 to purchase excess cream from local dairy farmers and sell butter to people in Brenham, Texas, a town situated approximately 70 miles northwest of Houston. In 1911, the creamery began to produce small quantities of ice cream. By 1919, the Creamery was in financial trouble and considered closing its doors. The board of directors hired E.F. Kruse, a 23-year-old former schoolteacher, to take over the company on April 1, 1919. Kruse refused to accept a salary for his first few months in the position so that the company would not be placed in further debt. Under his leadership, the company expanded its production of ice cream to the surrounding Brenham area and soon became profitable. At his suggestion, the company was renamed Blue Bell Creameries in 1930 after the Texas Bluebell, a wildflower native to Texas, and which like ice cream thrives during the summer. Until 1936, the creamery made ice cream by the batch. It could create a batch of ice cream every 20 minutes. That same year, in 1936, the company purchased its first continuous ice cream freezer, which could make of ice cream per hour. The ice cream would run through a spigot, allowing it to be poured into any size container. Kruse was diagnosed with cancer in 1951 and died within 8 weeks. His sons Ed and Howard took over leadership of the company. By the 1960s, the company completely abandoned the production of butter and began focusing solely on ice cream. After many years of selling ice cream only in Brenham, the company began selling its ice cream in the Houston area, eventually expanding throughout most of Texas including the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex and the state capital of Austin. By the end of the 1970s, sales had quadrupled, and by 1980 the creamery was producing over 10 million gallons (37,850,000 liters) of ice cream per year, earning $30 million annually. In 1989, Blue Bell began selling its ice cream in Oklahoma, and throughout the 1990s expansion pushed throughout the South Central and Southern United States, eventually expanding out to New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1992, Blue Bell built a new manufacturing facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Four years later, in 1996, Blue Bell opened a third manufacturing facility opened in Sylacauga, Alabama, east of Birmingham, and eventually expanded into Atlanta and Miami. Once Blue Bell establishes itself within a market, word-of-mouth usually ensures that consumers in adjacent areas become aware of the brand. Blue Bell has been slow to expand: company executives say they thoroughly research each new market and ensure that all employees in the new markets are fully trained in Blue Bell practices so that product quality can be upheld. Blue Bell often tends to expand to markets during March each year, expanding to Colorado on March 14, 2011, followed by the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas of Virginia in 2013, and Las Vegas in 2014. These expansions are accompanied with the purchase and/or construction of distribution centers in new markets that serve areas within a 75-mile radius. In 2015, Blue Bell issued a series of recalls that eventually shut down production and led to all of its products being recalled on April 20, culminating in job cuts and furloughs (as well as the reduction of its 23-state sales territory) resulting from the shutdown the following May. In conjunction with factory cleanup procedures and agreements with state and federal authorities, the company returned to production three months later on a limited basis, returning its products to the market on August 31 in portions of Texas and Alabama as part of a five-phase plan to return to much of its pre-recall distribution territory, which has been reduced to 21 states based on Blue Bell's limited distribution capabilities in the near term. In July 2019, The Blue Bell Creameries went viral after a teenage female licked one of their ice cream tubs at a Walmart in Texas, then placed it back in the freezer; she was later arrested. After the incident, multiple copycats were committed, and some were jailed. These incidents resulted with severe negative reactions that violating food in such a manner is dangerous to the public health, along with criticisms that no action is taken to punish any offenders and Blue Bell for not protecting their ice cream with a plastic seal. Operations The Blue Bell factory in Brenham As of 2015, the company operated three manufacturing facilities, with the largest facility in Brenham, and auxiliary facilities in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Sylacauga, Alabama. Before the 2015 recalls, there were 50 sales and distribution centers, known as branches, spread throughout its 23-state market. These facilities employed a combined 2,800 employees, with 850 of the employees working out of Brenham. In 2006, annual sales exceeded $400 million. Blue Bell retains control over all aspects of its business, primarily to ensure quality control and the use of the freshest ingredients available. The Kruses claim \\"the milk we use is so fresh it was grass only yesterday.\\" The company uses milk from approximately 60,000 cows each day, and the cream used during each day's production run is always less than 24 hours old. All production and packaging takes place within Blue Bell facilities, which are able to produce over 100 pints per minute. Drivers of delivery vehicles personally stock store shelves so they can ensure it is handled properly. According to figures gathered by Statista, a market data and statistics portal, while combined private labels sold more, in 2014 Blue Bell was the best-selling ice cream brand in the United States. The sales area is primarily concentrated in the Southern United States, and has been sold as far west as Las Vegas, as far north as Indianapolis and Denver, and as far east as Richmond, Virginia. Overall, this area comprises only 20% of the United States. By comparison, each of Blue Bell's top four competitors sells its products in 100% of the United States. To become one of the three biggest ice cream manufacturers, Blue Bell has consistently been the top seller in the majority of the markets the company has entered. For example, in its home state of Texas, the company has a 52% market share. Within five months of its entry into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company had garnered 35% of the ice cream market. People living outside the sales area can have the ice cream shipped to them (although this has temporarily been halted while the company is ramping up production after the recalls), and former President George W. Bush (a former Governor of Texas) often had the ice cream shipped to Camp David during his administration. In 2006 and 2012, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were also treated to Blue Bell ice cream \\"to help out (the crew's) happiness quotient.\\" Products Blue Bell shop at George Bush Intercontinental Airport Blue Bell produces over 250 different frozen products. Of these, 66 are flavors of ice cream. Twenty of the flavors are offered year-round, while an additional two to three dozen are offered seasonally. In addition to ice cream, the company produces frozen yogurt, sherbet, and an array of frozen treats on a stick. Unlike competitors which have reduced their standard containers to 48-56 fluid ounces (1.42-1.66 L), Blue Bell continues to sell true half-gallon (64 fl oz/1.89 L) containers, a fact it mentions prominently in its advertising. Blue Bell introduced its flagship flavor, Homemade Vanilla, in 1969 and was the first company to mass- produce the flavor Cookies 'n Cream. Although the company at one time made Cookies 'n Cream from Nabisco's Oreo cookies, buying ordinary retail packages, today it bakes its own cookies. As of 1997, Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla was the best-selling single flavor of ice cream in the United States, and in 2001, Forbes named Blue Bell the best ice cream in the country. R.W. Apple, Jr., of The New York Times claimed in 2006 that \\"[w]ith clean, vibrant flavors and a rich, luxuriant consistency achieved despite a butterfat content a little lower than some competitors, it hooks you from the first spoonful. Entirely and blessedly absent are the cloying sweetness, chalky texture, and oily, gummy aftertaste that afflict many mass-manufactured ice creams.\\" Occasionally, when Blue Bell enters a market the company marks the occasion with the introduction of a regional flavor within that market. For example, when it entered Colorado on March 14, 2011, Blue Bell introduced a new flavor exclusive to Colorado, Rocky Mountain Road, made with more premium ingredients (including chocolate-covered nuts and a marshmallow swirl) compared to its year-round Rocky Road. While the test market was in the Denver metropolitan area, there was speculation that the rest of the state would soon see Blue Bell on store shelves. Eventually, this flavor would be distributed to Blue Bell's entire sales territory. In 2018, children of an interracial family posted an open letter on Facebook addressed to Blue Bell asking that the flavor \\"The Great Divide\\" (equal halves of chocolate and vanilla) be changed to \\"Better Together\\". While Blue Bell spokespersons reacted positively to the name change proposal, the post became controversial among some Facebook users who dismissed the original name as inoffensive. 2015 listeriosis outbreak In 2015, Blue Bell issued its first recall in its 108-year history. The recall was issued on an assortment of items produced at its creameries, due to the discovery of five cases of listeriosis in Kansas believed to be caused by products produced at its creamery in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Three of the five patients with listeria died. Despite a series of subsequent recalls, and the temporary shutdown of its Broken Arrow plant, \\"an enhanced sampling program\\" launched by Blue Bell produced \\"several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants\\", including three further cases in Texas. As a result, on the evening of April 20, 2015 the company took precautionary measures and expanded its recall to cover all of its products‚Äîa recall of over eight million gallons, to be disposed of in a sanitary landfill. At the same time, the company shut down production and commenced cleanup and repair operations at its manufacturing facilities. The FDA found that the company failed to follow standard practices to prevent contamination; two years prior to the recalls, the company \\"repeatedly found listeria\\" in its Broken Arrow facility. At its main production facility in Brenham, one of its production machines (which produced most of the recalled products) was so contaminated that Blue Bell announced it would permanently stop using the machine, and condensation was also reported in parts of the Brenham facility. Although a spokeswoman for Blue Bell had previously demurred on the subject of job losses, on May 15, Blue Bell announced a series of job cuts and furloughs. 1,450 (or 37 percent) of the company's employees would be laid off, while another 1,400 employees were furloughed until cleanup/repair operations concluded, and the remaining 1,050 involved in essential operations and cleanup/repair operations had wage reductions imposed on them. In addition, due to limited supply and distribution capabilities expected in the near term, Blue Bell announced it would suspend operations at 15 of its over 50 distribution centers indefinitely, though it has not ruled out returning to these markets eventually. The affected distribution centers included: * Phoenix, Arizona (2 branches) * Tucson, Arizona * Denver, Colorado * Indianapolis, Indiana * Kansas City, Kansas * Wichita, Kansas * Louisville, Kentucky * Las Vegas, Nevada * Albuquerque, New Mexico * Charlotte, North Carolina * Raleigh, North Carolina * Columbia, South Carolina * Richmond, Virginia * Suffolk, Virginia (Hampton Roads area) The recalls were so severe that they threatened to shut down the company; executives warned shareholders that they faced a \\"capital crisis.\\" On July 14, 2015, Sid Bass, a prominent Texas investor, became a partner and investor with the company; Blue Bell secured a $125 million loan to continue operations. Around the same time, Blue Bell's plant in Sylacauga, Alabama resumed production, creating test batches as part of a \\"test and hold\\" procedure in which ice cream is not packaged for sale until the batch tests negative for all strains of bacteria including the strain of listeria responsible for the aforementioned recalls. =Return= On August 17, 2015, Blue Bell announced a five-phase plan to return to store shelves: * Phase 1: Houston and Austin areas of Texas, plus Birmingham and Montgomery areas of Alabama (near the company's Sylacauga facility). * Phase 2: North central Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth) and northern Oklahoma including Tulsa (near the company's Broken Arrow facility). * Phase 3: Southwest Texas (San Antonio) and central Oklahoma including Oklahoma City. * Phase 4: Majority of Texas plus southern Louisiana including Baton Rouge and New Orleans. * Phase 5: Remainder of Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma and Louisiana, plus all of Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi and parts of Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Even in those states where Blue Bell plans to return, it will not necessarily return to all of its pre-recall markets by the final phase. Those markets, including Charlotte, Kansas City, Louisville & Phoenix, were added based on the fact that Blue Bell will effectively service those areas. For now, Wichita, KS & Las Vegas, NV have yet to return. Phase 1 began on August 31, 2015. Phase 2 began in November, 2015. A month later phases 3 and 4 began. The day following its initial rollout, September 1, Blue Bell resumed production at its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma facility. On January 28, 2016, the company resumed distribution to large portions of the Southeastern US. On March 6, 2017, Blue Bell reopened the three distribution centers located in Tucson (1), and Phoenix (2) to complete distribution across the state of Arizona. In March 2018, the company began distribution to much of Indiana, midsection of Kentucky & northern New Mexico. In March 2019, the company resumed distribution to much of the Virginia area, northeastern North Carolina & greater Kansas City. =Justice Department investigation= In December 2015, CBS Evening News reported that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a federal criminal investigation into Blue Bell Creameries, to determine \\"what exactly Blue Bell executives knew about the contaminations and unsanitary conditions, when they knew, and what they did in response\\". The investigation, by the DOJ's Consumer Protection Branch, is reportedly led by trial attorney Patrick Hearn, who successfully prosecuted executives of the Peanut Corporation of America in 2015. Mark Abueg, a DOJ spokesman, told the Houston Press: \\"As a matter of policy, the Justice Department generally neither confirms nor denies whether a matter is under investigation.\\" See also * List of dairy product companies in the United States Further reading * Inampudi, Naveen and Debbie Z.

Cadena temporal included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance. Cadena perpetua is identical except that it is a sentence of life as opposed to a temporary status. The \\"title\\" of the punishment is actually descriptive, as cadena is a Spanish word meaning chainhttp://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=cadena while temporal means impermanent or temporary, in addition to the meaning it shares with Englishhttp://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=temporal and perpetua, means continuous in Latin and Spanish.http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/cgi- bin/aglimpse- latin/16/www/Lexis/Latin?query=perpetua&case;=on&whole;=on&errors;=0 One of the places these punishments were provided for was the Philippine legal system. This was a result of the Spanish Penal Code of 1870, which was adopted due to the country having been a Spanish colony until 1898. Cadena temporal was among the penalties repealed in 1932 with the enactment of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. The use of this colonial punishment has been reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910).http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court;=us&vol;=217&invol;=349 Derived from the Spanish penal Code, the punishment of \\"cadena temporal\\" was from twelve years and one day to twenty years (arts. 28 and 96), which 'shall be served' in certain 'penal institutions.' And it was provided that 'those sentenced to cadena temporal (and cadena perpetua) shall labor for the benefit of the state. They shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists; they shall be employed at hard and painful labor, and shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the institution.' There were, besides, certain accessory penalties imposed with it. In Weems, the Supreme Court ruled this punishment to be \\"cruel and unusual\\" for a crime of \\"corruptly, and with intent then and there to deceive and defraud the United States government of the Philippine Islands and its officials, falsify[ing] a public and official document.\\" Weems v. United States breaks away with the \\"historic method\\" of interpretation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting such penalties. It thus paves the way to a modern interpretation of the Bill of Rights based on a new criterion: the \\"evolving standards of decency of a maturing society\\" designed by the Supreme Court in Trop v.

This is the first page of the 6th edition of their dictionary (1835) Linguistic purism or linguistic protectionism is the prescriptive practice of defining or recognizing one variety of a language as being purer or of intrinsically higher quality than other varieties. Linguistic purism was institutionalized through language academies (of which the 1572 Accademia della Crusca set a model example in Europe), and their decisions often have the force of law. The perceived or actual decline identified by the purists may take the form of change of vocabulary, syncretism of grammatical elements, or loanwords. The unwanted similarity is often with a neighboring language whose speakers are culturally or politically dominant. The ideal may invoke logic, clarity, or the grammar of classic languages. It is often presented as conservative measure, as a protection of a language from the encroachment of other languages or of conservation of the national Volksgeist, but is often innovative in defining a new standard. It is sometimes part of governmental language policy which is enforced in various ways. The practice opposite of purism, when borrowed words displace native ones, also exists. For example, in English the native word 'bookstaff' (German Buchstabe) was replaced by the Latin word 'letter'. Cognate languages In one common case, two closely related languages or language varieties are in direct competition, one weaker, the other stronger. Speakers of the stronger language may characterize the weaker language as a \\"dialect\\" of the strong language, with the implication that it has no independent existence. In response, defenders of the other language will go to great lengths to prove that their language is equally autonomous. In this context, Yiddish and Dutch have in the past sometimes been considered dialects of German. In the case of Low German, spoken in eastern Netherlands and northern Germany, the debate is still current, as it could be considered a dialect of Dutch or German or a language of its own. An example of a related language that has only recently attained the status of an official national language is Luxembourgish. Since linguistic science offers no scholarly definition of a dialect, and linguists regard the distinction with scepticism ‚Äì see A language is a dialect with an army and navy ‚Äì the argument is really about subjective questions of identity politics, and at times it can invoke extreme emotions from the participants. =Writing systems= Closely related languages often tend to mix. One way of preventing this is to use different writing systems or different spelling systems. Examples of this include: * Moldovan and Romanian are virtually identical in all respects except that Moldovan used the Cyrillic script ‚Äì which is still in use in Transnistria ‚Äì and Romanian uses the Latin script. * Hindi and Urdu, traditionally kept separated by using the Devanagari and Arabic script, respectively. This is a well-known example often cited in linguistic texts; however, in recent decades, it has been observed that the languages are tending to drift much further apart, due to the Sanskritization of Hindi and the Arabization and Persianization of Urdu. * The Serbian and Croatian literary standards differ mainly in using the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, respectively. Both of them exhibit a high degree of mutual intelligibility by dint of being based on essentially the same dialect (a stylized form of Neo≈°tokavian). Forms Various scholars have devised classifications of purism. These classifications take different criteria as their starting point and are therefore partly independent of each other. =Based on the approach= * Archaizing purism: This happens when a speech- community tries to revive the language of a perceived or actual golden age of literature. Examples: Arabic, Tanittamil Iyakkam in Tamil, Icelandic (see also: Linguistic purism in Icelandic), Ancient Greek (Atticism), Katharevousa in Modern Greek, Sanskrit, Latin (puristic obsession with classical forms among speakers of Romance languages and those influenced by them during the Renaissance). See also Language revival. * Ethnographic purism: This form is based on an idealization of the countryside, folk stories and dialects. Examples: Nynorsk (New Norwegian), some versions of Demotic Greek. * Elitist purism: Associated with a highly formal variety linked to an elite, for example the language spoken at the court. * Reformist purism: The main feature here is to break the bonds with the past. An example of this is the removal of Persian and Arabic words during Turkish language reform under Atat√ºrk in order to break with the Ottoman Turkish language influenced by Arabic and Persian. Other examples are the purist efforts in languages like Hausa, Swahili and Hindi to break with the colonial past. In addition, language policies may seek to decrease similarities between mutually intelligible languages for ethno- political reasons, as has been the case with Dano-Norwegian, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu) and Malaysian/Indonesian. * Patriotic purism: involves the elimination or exclusion of foreign elements. Examples include High Norwegian, Korean and Anglish. Many English writers of the 19th and 20th centuries extolled the virtues of \\"strong\\" Anglo-Saxon words such as foreword, which was coined to replace the \\"weak\\" Romance word preface. French, Germans, Greeks and Latvians are known for their preference for coining words over borrowing foreign words (but this does not always work well, since many French words or expressions coined to avoid the use of a loanword (especially an English one) have not been adopted in common language, or are used only marginally). This classification of puristic orientations made by George Thomas represents ideal forms. In practice, though, these orientations are often combined. =Based on the goals= * Democratic purism: Aims at safeguarding the intelligibility of (modern) concepts for a larger group of language users through enforcing their expression by the means of common, every-day words or expressions (for example, \\"back[ing] up\\" instead of \\"sustain[ment]\\") * Unificatory purism: Aims at better uniting the overall user group of a language by reducing certain regional or professional linguistic peculiarities which could separate varying aspects of life, or even obstruct interconnectivity, between individuals or sub-groups of different regional provenience or professional background. * Defensive purism: Aims at defending a language from external threats. Mostly, these are to be understood as influx of foreign ideas which a given language group (or its political system) disdains or has overthrown, or influx of foreign words or expressions which tend to substitute innate vocabulary, thus diminishing and/or endangering supra-regional or inter-generational intelligibility within a language area or between its present speakers and the literary remnants of their venerated ancestors, i. e., some kind of \\"classical\\" heritage (as e. g. Shakespeare's usage is already no more widely understood amongst many of today's English speakers ). * Prestige purism: Aims at varying prestige functions. * Delimiting purism: Aims at establishing some kind of separating functions. =Based on the intensity= * Marginal purism: Purism never becomes at any stage a value-feature of the speech community. On the contrary, there is a certain openness to all sources of enrichment, at the same time characterized by a lack among the language elite of intellectual digestion of foreign influxes, or by a lack of such an elite as a whole. Examples: English, Russian, Polish, Japanese, Ancient Greek. * Moderate, discontinuous purism: A moderate attitude is discernible over a long period of time. Examples: Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian. * Trimming purism: A reactive correction to a potentially dangerous trend in the development of a standard language. Examples: Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Slovak. * Evolutionary purism: Purism is seen early in the development of a written language. There are no radical changes or orientation. During the standardising process, purism gains momentum after which it slows down. Examples: Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, Hebrew, Latvian, Croatian and Slovene. * Oscillatory purism: Involves repeated swings between intense purism and a more inclusive attitude. Examples: German, Czech and Yiddish. * Stable, consistent purism: No interruption or fluctuation in intensity is seen. Purism is a constant value- feature of the speech community. Examples: Arabic, Tamil and Icelandic. * Revolutionary purism: An abrupt change from the previously mentioned patterns to another. Examples: Turkish. =Based on linguistic level= * Lexical purism: directed at the lexicon, first of all against direct lexical loans, often combined with the development of loan translations (such as in Norwegian: hand out > st√∏tteark and snowboard > sn√∏brett or Arabic tilif≈´n > hƒÅtif and kumby≈´tir > ·∏•ƒÅs≈´b. * Orthographic purism: directed against foreign orthographic elements (such as in Norwegian: genre > sjanger, in Spanish: football > f√∫tbol). Note that there is also reverse orthographic purism. Some Spanish speakers prefer the English spelling \\"blue jean\\" and object to the spelling bluy√≠n. * Morphological purism: directed against foreign inflection and declension (such as the resistance to plural -s in noun endings in Scandinavian languages). * Syntactic purism: directed at syntactic features from other languages (such as the stylistic resistance in Nynorsk against some passive constructions and some constructions with the genitive). * Phonetic purism: directed at foreign phonemes and phonematical combinations (such as g√°nster or champ√∫ in Spanish). There is a reverse phonetic purism, which insists in the original pronunciation, such as pronouncing g√°ngster and shamp√∫ in Spanish. =Other forms= * Regressive purism: The eradication of very old loan-words. It is one of the main features of ultrapurism. * ': The extreme upper limit of purism. In this pattern, everything expressed by human speech can become a target for puristic intervention, even geographical names, proper names, etc. (The attitude ‚Äì in itself \\"puristic\\" and associated with increased education and foreign language competency ‚Äì opposed to the translation or adaptation of toponyms, or even personal names, is historically quite recent, as names are not considered fixed or unchanging in most cultures; and there are many exceptions even in English, especially the names of historical personages, Native Americans, and even contemporary royalty. Historically, names were part of the lexicon of a language just as every other word, and it was common to have different names associated with different language communities. See exonym and endonym. The longer established the tradition of a name or term, the more likely are strong differences.) The only two recorded examples of this are High Icelandic (H√°fr√≥nska), and the usage of the German renaissance humanist Johann Georg Turmair who even translated the name of the ancient Roman general Fabius Cunctator into Zauderer Bohnenmaier (i. e. literally \\"Laggard Bean-Mayor\\"). While not ultra-purism per se, phono-semantic matching is commonly used in a number of languages, notably for translating proper names into Chinese.

With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's built up area which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part. Balagtas is from Manila and is from Malolos City. Formerly known as Bigaa, it was renamed in honor of Filipino poet Francisco Balagtas. The MacArthur Highway bisects the municipality of Balagtas as this national road cuts northward to the Ilocos region. At the southern approach of the town from Manila is a concrete bridge that crosses the Balagtas River. The river, navigable by banca and motor boats, empties into Manila bay after snaking through the town of Bulacan to the West which provides Balagtas' townsfolk with fish, shrimp, and other fresh water food. At the foot of the bridge, along the highway towards the North, is the town hall. In front of the town hall is a park where the monument of its hero, Francisco \\"Balagtas\\" Baltazar is located. The town hall is surrounded by Spanish colonial type houses. Two hundred meters from the municipal hall is the barrio of Panginay, the birthplace of Francisco Balagtas, for whom also \\"Balagtasan\\", a form of debate in versified Tagalog, was named. In 1946 the Historical Society of the Philippines placed a marker at the birthplace of Balagtas. In reverence to the hero's deeds, the official name of Bigaa was changed to Balagtas through the legislative act sponsored by then Congressman, Teodulo Natividad.

Originally known as Caruya/Caluya as per as the history records regarding the early years of the establishment of Bulacan Province, Caruya was one of the Encomiendas of the vast region La Pampanga falls under the Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan. Encomienda de Caruya was Encomienda of the King of Spain which appeared in Miguel de Loarca's Relacion delas Isla Filipinas in 1582 and the Report of Governor- General Luis Perez de Dasmari√±as of June 21, 1591 document.

(Historia de La Provincia Agustiana del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas Vol.1 of Isacio Rodriguez OSA) On other data, the Center for Bulacan Studies in their \\"La Primera Provincia\\" published in 2010 p. 138 mentioned that Bigaa came from Malolos as its matrix with a date independency date of 1621.

The descriptor can apply to objects of different types, including cells, where one mechanism of crenation is the contraction of a cell after exposure to a hypertonic solution, due to the loss of water through osmosis. In a hypertonic environment, the cell has a lower concentration of solutes than the surrounding extracellular fluid, and water diffuses out of the cell by osmosis, causing the cytoplasm to decrease in volume. As a result, the cell shrinks and the cell membrane develops abnormal notchings. Pickling cucumbers and salt-curing of meat are two practical applications of crenation. Plasmolysis is the term which describes plant cells when the cytoplasm shrinks from the cell wall in a hypertonic environment. In plasmolysis, the cell wall stays intact, but the plasma membrane shrinks and the chloroplasts of the plant cell concentrate in the center of the cell. Red blood cells In (d) the RBCs are rendered crenated from a hypertonic solution Crenation is also used to describe a feature of red blood cells. These erythrocytes look as if they have projections extending from a smaller central area, like a spiked ball. The crenations may be either large, irregular spicules of acanthocytes, or smaller, more numerous, regularly irregular projections of echinocytes. Acanthocytes and echinocytes may arise from abnormalities of the cell membrane lipids or proteins, or from other disease processes, or as an ex vivo artifact.

Generally considered a quick napkin test to determine if the asset qualifies for further review and analysis. Cash on Cash analyses are generally used by investors looking for properties where cash flow is paramount, however, some use it to determine if a property is undervalued, indicating instant equity in a property. Example Suppose an investor purchases a $1,200,000 apartment complex with a $300,000 down payment. Each month, the cash flow from rentals, less expenses, is $5,000. Over the course of a year, the before-tax income would be $5,000 √ó 12 = $60,000, so the NOI (Net Operating Income)-on-cash return would be : \\\\frac{\\\\$\\\\ \\\\mbox{60,000}}{\\\\$\\\\ \\\\mbox{300,000}}=0.20=20\\\\%. However, because the investor used debt to service a portion of the asset, they are required to make debt service payments and principal repayments in this scenario (I.E. mortgage payments). Because of this, the Cash-on-Cash return would be a lower figure which would be determined by dividing the NOI after all mortgage payment expenses were deducted from it, by the total cash invested. For example: If the investor made total mortgage payments (principal+interest) of $2,000 a month in this scenario, then the Cash-on-Cash investment would be as follows: $2,000x12= $24,000. $60,000-$24,000= $36,000. \\\\frac{\\\\$\\\\ \\\\mbox{36,000}}{\\\\$\\\\ \\\\mbox{300,000}}=0.12=12\\\\%. Limitations *Because the calculation is based solely on before-tax cash flow relative to the amount of cash invested, it cannot take into account an individual investor's tax situation, the particulars of which may influence the desirability of the investment. However the investor can usually deduct enough Capital Cost Allowance to defer the taxes for a long time. *The formula does not take into account any appreciation or depreciation. When some cash is a return of capital (ROC) it will falsely indicate a higher return, because ROC is not income. *It does not account for other risks associated with the underlying property. *It is essentially a simple interest calculation, and ignores the effect of compounding interest. The implication for investors is that an investment with a lower nominal rate of compound interest may be superior, in the long run, to an investment with a higher cash-on-cash return. It is possible to perform an after-tax Cash on Cash calculation, but accurate depictions of your adjusted taxable income are needed to correctly address how much tax payment is being saved through depreciation and other losses.

According to the , it has a population of people.  Etymology  The name \\"Calumpit\\" comes from the tree \\"Kalump√≠t\\", an indigenous hardwood species similar to apalit and narra, which grows abundantly in front of the St. John the Baptist Parish Church in the Poblaci√≥n-Sucol area.  History  Calumpit Poblacion =Precolonial era= Calumpit was already an established barangay under the leadership of Gat Maitim prior to the Fall of the Kingdom of Tondo in June 1571. Other nearby villages were Gatbuka, Meyto, Meysulao, Pandukot, Malolos, Macabebe, Hagonoy, and Apalit. When Calumpit was hispanised and established as a political and geographical entity in 1572, they chose what is today Barangay Poblaci√≥n as the site of the church and the administrative center of the aforementioned villages, which were annexed to it. =Spanish period= Upon hearing that the Kingdom of Tondo was conquered by Mart√≠n de Go√≠ti and Juan Salcedo, and that Rajah Matanda allied with the Spaniards in May 1571, Bambalito formed a fleet of two thousand natives mostly from Hagonoy and Macabebe. They sailed across Manila Bay to Tondo on June 3, 1571, facing Go√≠ti and Salcedo in the historic Battle of Bangkusay. Bambalito and the natives were defeated and the conquerors proceeded northwards to pacify other villages along the coast of Manila Bay. In September 1571, Go√≠ti and Salcedo, along with the invading forces, arrived at Lubao. On November 14, 1571, they reached Calumpit and Malolos and reported it to Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, the first Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines. The two settlements were then constituted as the Encomienda de Calumpit and Encomienda de Malolos, respectively. The Encomienda de Calumpit was entrusted to Sargento Juan Moron, one of the conquerors in the Legazpi Expedition. Christianization It is uncertain as to exactly when the Augustinians first set foot in Calumpit, but according to the documents, Calumpit was already a parish by May 3, 1572, when Fray Mart√≠n de Rada was elected Prior Provincial. Calumpit was simultaneously established with the conventos of Bay, Laguna, Tondo and Lubao, Pampanga, with De Rada as its prior and Fray Diego Vivar as his vicar. Accounts state that the Augustinian missionaries planted a wooden cross along the bank of the Meyto River to symbolise the baptism of the land, and they built a chapel made of nipa and bamboo. Later, they moved to Meysulao and built another visita, and then in Panducot, where they built another chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Visitation as Fray Gaspar de San Agust√≠n mentioned in his Conquistas delas Isla Philipinas (Libro Segundo, Chapter 9). Subsequently, the missionary headquarters was moved again to a much higher place where a very huge and prominent tree called \\"Kalumpit\\" (Terminalia macrocarpa decne) stands as the original settlers named the place. Another notable characteristic of the village of Calumpit is that it was bounded by rivers which served as a natural moat-like feature. Primarily, Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot and Calumpit was independent barangays under their own chiefs, it is same with Gatbuka, Bugyon and other old settlements. On April 5, 1572, Legaspi merged the villages of Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot, Calumpit, Candaba, Apalit and Malolos and these villages became ministerios and visitas and these settlements first formed the town named Calumpit, with present-day Calumpit as center. On December 28, 1575, Gov. General Francisco Sande ordered the inclusion of the villages of Agonoy (Hagonoy), Quinabalonan (now Santa Monica and San Jose, Hagonoy), and some villages along Macabebe river to the town of Calumpit. Early Spanish presence When Calumpit was already pacified by Spaniards and submitted under the colonial rule, On April 5, 1572, Encomiendas of Calumpit and Malolos was unified under the shared administration of their encomenderos Don Marcos de Herrera and Sargento Mayor Juan Moron. One month later on the same year Calumpit was created as one of the centers of the Augustinian ministry in Northern Luzon with Convento de Lubao Pampanga, which includes Betis and Bacolor and Convento de Taal Batangas established on May 3, 1572, upon the election of Fray Mart√≠n de Rada as the new Prior Provincial of the Augustinians replacing Fray Diego de Herrera who was recalled to Mexico. This parochial beginnings of Calumpit has included the old villages of Hagonoy, Apalit, Candaba, Malolos and Macabebe as its missions. The town of Calumpit was originally dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, but in December 1576, the town was re-dedicated to the patronage of Saint John the Baptist.Administracion espiritual de los Padres Agustinos calsados de la Provincia del Duche Nombre de Jesus de las islas Filipinas, Valladolid, Imprenta de H. Roldan, Mayo de 1833, p. 47 Province of Calumpit On December 28, 1575 Governor-General Francisco de Sande established Calumpit as an Alcaldia (Province) with Marcos de Arce as the first Alcalde Mayor, with Calumpit and nearby visitas and settlements such as Malolos, Hagonoy, Macabebe, Apalit and Candaba. Later in 1576, jurisdiction of Macabebe transferred to the town of Lubao and Candaba separated an became town, then on June 11, 1580, Malolos became a town and it was transferred to Alcaldia de Bulacan. In 1581, Hagonoy had its own convent but still under the Governor of Calumpit, while in 1591 Apalit officially separated and established as an independent town and it was transferred in the reconfigured territory of Pampanga province. In Miguel de Loarca's document in 1581 called Relaci√≥n de las Islas Filipinas and the June 1591 document of Governor-General Luis P√©rez de Dasmari√±as, it is proven that Calumpit appears as an independent Alcaldia, independent of those of Bulacan and Lubao and Betis. It was therefore established as an Encomienda and Alcaldia separate to Province of Bulacan. Contrary to popular belief, Calumpit was not only the first town founded in Bulacan but it existed as a Province. Abolition The Alcaldia de Calumpit was eventually abolished and the towns of Calumpit and Hagonoy were annexed to the Province of Bulacan. Neighbouring Apalit was meanwhile annexed to Pampanga. = Philippine Revolution and Philippine- American War = During the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Calumpite√±os participated in battles launched by the Katipunan against the Spanish Empire. Many notable Calumete√±os helped establish and support the Malolos Republic, with the town serving as a defense line due to its proximity to the new capital. When the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War erupted, Calumpit become the headquarters of General Antonio Luna in 1898. In the bloody encounters at Barrio Bagbag on April 25, 1899, many people joined the army of General Luna. Civil administration under the United States-led Insular Government was established in Calumpit in April 1901, with Juan Galang serving as the first elected American-era mayor of the town. = American Occupation and World War II = Calumpit played an important role at the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific theater. The bridge of Calumpit, on the way to Bataan was demolished by the Engineering Battalion of the U.S., impeding movement of the Japanese forces on their way to Bataan. In January 1942, the Japanese Government occupied Calumpit for three years, during which many of the townsfolk died. In the middle of 1943, the first part of the USAFFE guerrilla was established under the leadership of Luis Macam, with most of the members from Calumpit. In June 1944, the 4th Battalion of the Del Pilar Regiment was established under the leadership of Major Francisco del Rosario. They continued fighting until the returned of the USAFFE under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur. In January 1945, the combined Filipino and American troops arrived in the town, liberating it from Japanese control. Geography Calumpit is from Manila and from Malolos City. Calumpit is sprawled over an area of 5,625 has. of flat terrain classified accordingly to use for agricultural (66.81%), residential (10.42%), industrial (2.48%), commercial, (0.89%) and other (1.05%) purposes. It occupies around 2.06% of the total land area of Bulacan. The municipality has 144.33 kilometers of concrete roads that easily link its 29 barangays. Two distinct seasons characterize the town's climate: rainy season which starts late May and ends around November; and dry season which begins November and lasts until April. Calumpit has two types of soil ‚Äì the silt loam which is found in almost 90% of the entire municipality and the clay loam in the south-east far end of the town. Both types are basically suited for agricultural purposes as per Department of Agriculture (Philippines) classifications. =Calumpit River= Calumpit River The stretch of waterway where two great rivers traversing through Calumpit, the Angat River and the Pampanga River is referred to as the Calumpit River. This river has shaped the lives of Bulake√±os since time immemorial. With the longest river system in Bulacan, Calumpit River traverses the towns of Calumpit, Pulilan and Plaridel on the east, Paombong and Hagonoy in the West and winds up through Apalit, Macabebe and Masantol, Pampanga. It was the major route for trade and commerce in this part of the Luzon prior to the arrival of Spain. The Pampanga and Quingua Rivers served as arteries through which goods coming in and going out of Calumpit passed. At present, the river is a valued resource as a rich fishing ground and providing farmers with irrigation. =Climate= The climate of Calumpit is similar to that of the rest of the other municipalities in the province of Bulacan. It is characterized by two (2) distinct seasons namely; the rainy and the dry. The rainy seasons starts from late May and ends around November, the dry season from December to April. The average annual rainfall is with the month of August having the highest month average rainfall, about . The annual number of rainy days is 175 days. =Barangays= Calumpit is divided into 29 barangays. Demographics In the , the population of Calumpit was , with a density of . Calumpit's population was 101,068 in the Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO) 2010 census. Historically, its population grew at an average of 3.71% per annum. The barangay with the largest population is Iba Oeste, with 10,610 residents, while the smallest is Sucol with 1,410 residents. Calumpit has a relatively young population, with the age group 1‚Äì19 years old, constituting 46.01% of the total population. The rest consists mainly of the working group between the ages of 20 to 59 years old accounting for about 47.96% and the elderly comprising 6.02%. In terms of sex distribution, males exceeded the number of females very slightly with a count of 35,710 and 35,087, respectively. = Language = Calumpit is a predominantly Tagalog-speaking town, with about 96.3% of its people being fluent speakers. Residents in the northernmost barangays (bordering Apalit) speak Kapampangan while a minority speak other Philippine languages. =Religion= San Juan Bautista Parish Church As Calumpit is the first town in Bulacan to have been Christianized by the Spaniards in 1572, about 80% of residents profess the Roman Catholic faith. Under the United States and because of the eventual disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines in 1902, Protestantism gained a foothold in the municipality. Significant religious minorities include the Iglesia ni Cristo, Members Church of God International, Iglesia Filipina Independiente. Among the oldest churches in Bulacan found in Calumpit is the San Juan Bautista Church. Constructed under Augustinian friars Mart√≠n de Rada and Diego Vivar, it was initially made of nipa and bamboo and gradually built of stone in 1700. It enshrines the local patron saint, John the Baptist, whose liturgical birthday on 24 June is celebrated as the town fiesta. Inside the church is a tunnel that, as legend would have it, was used by priests during the Spanish era as an escape route in the event of Chinese and Moro pirate attacks. It is a declared Diocesean Shrine of the Diocese of Malolos. Meyto Shrine The Meyto Shrine marks the cradle of Christianity in western Bulacan, where a wooden cross was first planted and first mass in the region was said in May 1572. The shrine, located in the western part of town, is also the site of the original church of Calumpit, predating the existing one in the town centre. During the Philippine Revolution, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente ‚Äì which had by then separated rom the Catholic Church ‚Äì took over Meyto Shrine. = Labor and employment = In 1995, Calumpit had a relatively big labor force of 24,095 or 66% of the population aged 20‚Äì59. Around 35% of these skilled and were employed in their respective occupations; 28% were housewives with occasional employment as farmhands, selling farm produce in the market and doing marginal odd jobs. Others were unclassified and consisted mostly of students, out-of-school youth and the unemployed. Total household income per annum is ‚Ç±705 million, with the annual average household income is ‚Ç±66,600 and per capita income annually is ‚Ç±12,198. =Literacy= The high literacy rate (98.5%) is maintained by its 24 elementary schools and six secondary or high schools. The Bulacan Manpower and Livelihood Training Center (BMLTC), based at the heart of the town, offers vocational courses and serves as the training ground for both unskilled and highly skilled workers. As a result, most Calumpite√±os have acquired and maintained skills suited for employment especially in the agri-industrial field.

The Libad is a river procession held every Saint John's Eve on June 23 to honour the town's patron. Calumpite√±os sing, dance and douse water to \\"baptize\\" passers-by, recalling the saint's characteristic act. The ritual and its traditional route are relics of the old fluvial procession held when Apalit and Hagonoy were still governed from Calumpit. The festivities carry on to the next day, June 24, the feast of Saint John the Baptist. One of the oldest barangays in the town, established in 1575, Santa Lucia is very popular and famous because of the supposedly miraculous image of its patroness, Saint Lucy. During the village festival, every December 12‚Äì13, the streets of the village are strung with colorful banderitas, as is the fa√ßade of Santa Lucia Church. Pilgrims visit the church for the two-day celebration, with the novena to the saint beginning on December 4. =Bagbag Bridge= Bagbag Bridge was the site of the longest battle between the Americans and Filipinos led by General Gregorio del Pilar on April 25, 1899. The bridge is now a reminder of the valor displayed by the Filipino who triumphed against the American forces. =Resorts= *Jed's Island Resort *Leticia's Garden Resort and Events Place *Lawiswis Kawayan *Amazing Grace Resort *El Bueno Resort Education Colegio de Calumpit (formerly Calumpit Institute) Calumpit has several elementary and secondary schools.

The municipality of Do√±a Remedios Trinidad was named in honor of Do√±a Remedios T. Romualdez, mother of then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos, who was a Bulake√±a from the town of Baliuag. The municipality covers seven barangays, originally part of Angat, Norzagaray, and San Miguel. These are Pulong Sampaloc and Camachile of Angat; Bayabas and Kabayunan of Norzagaray; Talbac, Camachin and Kalawakan of San Miguel. Geography Do√±a Remedios Trinidad is the largest municipality in Bulacan, occupying almost 1/3 of the total land area of the province. It lies on the southern edge of the Sierra Madre mountain range, and partially embraces three major conservation areas: the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve, Biak-na-Bato National Park, and Do√±a Remedios‚ÄìGeneral Tinio Watershed Forest Reserve, comprising 327.3 km¬≤ of alienable and disposable public land. =Barangays= Do√±a Remedios Trinidad is politically subdivided into the following 8 barangays: =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Do√±a Remedios Trinidad was people, with a density of .

Pineapple plantation in Barangay Talbak On December 12, 2007, the Province of Bulacan and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) signed an agreement for the development of an P11-billion bulk water supply project. Ayala-owned Manila Water Co. Inc. will implement the project. MWSS and Manila Water will provide a financial package of an infrastructure grant, a P10-million development assistance and a P10-million royalty fee to the towns of Norzagaray and Do√±a Remedios Trinidad, which will host the water supply project.ABS-CBN, Bulacan govt, MWSS ink deal on bulk water supply project  Education  One of the main secondary school in DRT is the Do√±a Remedios Trinidad High School located in Barangay Pulong Sampaloc.

It is the birthplace of composer Constancio De Guzman, known for writing songs like \\"Maalaala Mo Kaya\\". It also houses the Immaculate Conception Seminary, a Diocesan Seminary of the Diocese of Malolos located in barangay Tabe. The appellation ‚ÄúGuiguinto‚Äù literally translates to ‚ÄúGold‚Äù for the early conquistadores came and saw this town on a harvest season when it lushes in golden rice stalks against the sun. History Guiguinto began as a barrio of Bulakan, the former provincial capital of Bulacan. It is said that Spaniards set up an army post in the barrio to serve as a resting place for forces going to Northern Luzon. In those days, travel throughout Guiguinto was difficult and slow down to cross single file over a narrow bamboo bridge. Their Filipino guides would cry out, \\"Hinto\\" (stop). The Spaniards thought this was the name \\"Hihinto\\". The Spaniards substituted \\"Gui\\" (with hard \\"g\\") for the Tagalog \\"Hi\\". The place has since been called Guiguinto. On the other hand, old timers say that on moonlight nights, a golden bull emerges from the church and goes down to the nearby river to quench his thirst. It then returns to the church, ascends at the altar and disappears. The elders' aid that there are buried jars of gold in town, as indicated by the bull, and that is why the town was called Guiguinto. It became an encomienda in the 1591 but the ecclesiastical administration was under Bulakan Convent and it was established as a Town in 1641. In 1800, an Augustinian friar erected a small chapel in what is now barrio Santa Rita. In 1873, roads were constructed in barrio Malis. The people barrios of Pritil, Tabe, and Cutcut even those days were mostly farmers. During Holy Week, villagers of barrio Tuktukan held contest for the hardest egg shells (chicken, duck or goose by knocking eggs together (Tuktukan)). The women tried to help each other in singing the \\"Panica\\". Just before the outbreak of the revolution of 1896, the town people of Guiguinto were ordered to sleep in the town at night and to work in their fields only in the day. This was said to have been suggested by the town priest to the authorities because of rumors that many of the town people were joining the secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan. Guiguinto eventually contributed many soldiers to the 1896 revolution. At the time of American occupation, the new colonizers reorganized the Province of Bulacan into 19 municipalities from the original 26. Under populated town were subordinated with the large one and the town of Guiguinto was integrated in the town of Bulakan for almost 11 years. In 1915, Guiguinto regain its township again with Antonio Figueroa as its municipal mayor of the modern period. The town's population was then about 4,000. The 1960 census placed Guiguinto's population at 10,629. Guiguinto is bounded on the east by the town of Balagtas, on the west by Malolos City, on the north by Plaridel, and on the south by Bulacan.

He is best known for performing under the ring name Waldo Von Erich, playing the character of a villainous Prussian Nazi. He was billed as the brother of Fritz Von Erich, making him a fictitious member of the Von Erich family.  Early life  Sieber was born in Toronto, Ontario. His parents divorced when he was seven. As a youth, he participated in weightlifting at the YMCA in Weston along other future professional wrestlers including Dave McKigney, Geeto Mongol, and Mikel Scicluna. At the age of 16, he began training as a professional wrestling under Red Garner in a garage in Richmond Hill.  Professional wrestling career  Sieber debuted at the age of 17 under the ring name \\"Waldo Von Sieber\\". He began his career in Calgary, wrestling for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion using the character of an evil German. In the late-1950s, Hart paired Sieber with Fritz Von Erich, who also portrayed a villainous German. With Sieber changing his ring name to \\"Waldo Von Erich\\", the duo billed themselves as brothers and formed a tag team. In 1964, Von Erich headlined Madison Square Garden in three bouts against Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship. The first bout lasted 81 minutes, ending in a draw when the match had to be halted due to an 11 o'clock curfew. The two following bouts were won by Sammartino. In 1968, Sieber unsuccessfully challenged Gene Kiniski for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a Texas death match promoted by NWA Big Time Wrestling in the HemisFair Arena in San Antonio, Texas. In 1970, Sieber lost to \\"Sonny\\", a 750 lb Kodiak bear, in a bout for NWA Tri-State staged in the Monroe Civic Center in Monroe, Louisiana. Sieber briefly retired in 1973, but returned to the ring later that year. He wrestled for the WWWF throughout the mid-1970s, unsuccessfully challenging Bob Backlund for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship in 1976.  Retirement  Sieber retired from professional wrestling in 1979. He studied reflexology and began working as a physical therapist in Kitchener. He also worked as an inventor, with his creations including the \\"Inverchair\\", an inverted chair device enabling him to hang upside down to alleviate his back pain which he sold to customers including the Department of National Defence. In the 1990s, Sieber was affiliated with Joe Frocklage's International Championship Wrestling promotion and school in Cambridge, where he trained wrestlers including Eric Young and The Highlanders.  Professional wrestling persona  For much of his career, Sieber portrayed a Prussian Nazi. As \\"Waldo Von Sieber\\" (also on occasion \\"Baron Von Sieber\\" or \\"Walter Von Sieber\\"), and later as \\"Waldo Von Erich\\", Sieber grew his blond hair long, wore a Stahlhelm, armband, and monocle, and carried a crop to the ring. His finishing move, a diving knee drop, was known as the \\"Blitzkrieg\\" in reference to the military tactic employed by Germany in World War II. Other finishing moves utilised by Sieber included a hold known as the \\"Prussian Deathlock\\" and a body press. While not recognised as an exceptional technical wrestler, Sieber was known for his ability to draw the ire of audiences, leading promoter Vincent J. McMahon to remark \\"You know, Waldo, I know what you're like, but I hate your guts when you're in that ring.\\"  Personal life  Sieber was the only child of Paul Sieber Sr. (a German immigrant) and Anna Yost (a Romanian immigrant). Sieber married Anne Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Jones in 1959; the couple divorced in 1988. They had three daughters together. Although Sieber was billed as being the brother of Jack Barton Adkisson Sr. (Fritz Von Erich), the two men were not related. However, Sieber was a distant cousin of Doris Adkisson, Adkisson Sr.'s wife. In 1985, professional wrestler William Vaughan was introduced to Fritz Von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling promotion under the ring name Lance Von Erich, purportedly the son of Waldo Von Erich; Vaughan and Sieber were not related.

Most of its products are based on silicon carbide (SiC), a mineral compound which early Cree researchers successfully synthesized in a laboratory. History Cree's high-power LEDs, XLamp 7090 XR-E Q4 A Cree 9.5 watt 800 lumen dimmable lamp bulb, with 2700 K color temperature, introduced in March 2013 Cree was founded in July 1987 in Durham, North Carolina. Five of the six founders ‚Äì Thomas Coleman, John Edmond, Eric Hunter, John Palmour and Calvin Carter ‚Äì are graduates of North Carolina State University. In 1983, the founders ‚Äì one a research assistant professor and the others student researchers ‚Äì were seeking ways to leverage the properties of silicon carbide to enable semiconductors to operate at higher operating temperatures and power levels. They also knew silicon carbide could serve as the diode in light- emitting diode (LED) lighting, a light source first demonstrated in 1907 with an electrically-charged diode of SiC. The research team devised a way to grow silicon crystals in the laboratory, and in 1987 founded a company, Cree Research, Inc., to produce SiC and exploit its usage commercially in both semiconductors and lighting. The founders raised money to establish office and laboratory facilities and entered a period of steady technological advancements. In 1989, the company introduced the world's first blue LED, which enabled the development of large, full-color video screens and billboards. In 1991, Cree released the world's first commercial silicon carbide wafer. In 1993, Cree launched an initial public offering. In 1999, the company name was changed from Cree Research to Cree, Inc. In 2011 Cree acquired Ruud Lighting, a national firm experienced in the use of LED for outdoor lighting. This expanded Cree sales channels and led to a new generation of lighting-class LED components. In 2012 Cree announced the XLamp XT-E, which was claimed to deliver twice as much light for the same price as older LEDs. In 2013, Cree's first consumer products, two household LED bulbs qualified for Energy Star rating by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In July 2016, German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it agreed to buy Cree's Wolfspeed business unit (RF and power electronics devices) for $850 million in cash.By Friedrich Geiger and Eyk Henning, Wall Street Journal. \\"Infineon to Buy Cree's Wolfspeed Unit for $850 Million .\\" July 14, 2016. However, the deal was called off in February 2017 after the companies were unable to resolve regulators‚Äô national security concerns. In March 2018, Cree announced the acquisition of Infineon Technologies AG's RF Power Business for ‚Ç¨345 million. In May 2019, Cree Inc. closed on the sale of their Cree Lighting Products division to Ideal Industries Inc. In October 2020, Cree Inc. closed on the sale of their LED Business to SMART Global Holdings for up to $300 million.

The people of Barrio Casay worked for reforms politically, socially and economically, in order to be separated from Angat. They succeeded in their separation bid through Governor-General Fern√°ndo Norzagaray y Escudero (1857-1860) who issued a Real Cedula declaring barrio Casay together with barrio Matictic to be constituted as a new independent town from Angat. Political boundaries of Angat and Pueblo de Casay y Matictic were demarcated and the newly created town was renamed as \\"Norzagaray\\" in honor of the said Governor-General Fernando de Norzagaray. =Cityhood= As early as 2005, the town‚Äôs Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 2005 requesting the Senate of the Philippines through its president, Franklin Drilon and the House of Representatives thru its speaker, Jose de Venecia Jr. to co-sponsor a bill for Norzagaray‚Äôs conversion into a city and creation of a lone legislative district.

People from distant towns often visit the place for relaxation. Another potential spot for tourism is the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve where the Angat River Hydroelectric Plant or Angat Dam is located. The dam is the biggest hydroelectric plant the National Power Corporation (NPC) has ever constructed in terms of power capacity within the entire Philippines. Because of Angat Dam's size, its reservoir sinks to critical levels during the dry season necessitating the need for cloud seeding in some years. The reservoir of this hydroelectric plant is covered with forests producing a cool climate. Another is the Pinagrealan Cave located in Barangay Bigte. This cave is a subterranean network of caverns extending more than a kilometer deep. The Katipunero Revolutionaries during the war against Spain used it as a camp in 1896 and again during the Filipino-American War in 1898 as hideout of General Emilio Aguinaldo (the First President of the Philippines). It was also used as a sanctuary by the Japanese Imperial Army when the Philippines was liberated by joint Filipino and American Forces. There are still other sites with tourism potential in the locality. However, some of these places are located in remote areas of the town, which are inaccessible to motor vehicles, therefore in need of immediate attention. = Historical and Cultural Heritage = The natives are religious and hear Mass or pray in the Catholic and INC churches.

Soros held Niederhoffer in such high esteem that he sent his son to work for him to learn how to trade. Academia As an academic at Berkeley in the 1960s, Niederhoffer wrote a number of papers on anomalies in stock market behavior. His paper Market Making and Reversal on the Stock Exchange (1966) made Niederhoffer the father of statistical arbitrage and of market microstructure studies. He used innovative methods to search for opportunities in stock markets, such as his paper The Analysis of World Events and Stock Prices (1971), which used the font size of news print to determine the relative importance of news events and measure how they affected the stock market. He left academia in 1972 to concentrate fully on his business activities. Returns Niederhoffer Investments returned 35% a year from inception through 1996, when MAR ranked it the No. 1 hedge fund manager in the world. In 1997, Niederhoffer published a New York Times bestselling book, The Education of a Speculator. 1997 losses In 1997, Niederhoffer Investments was not finding many opportunities for investments and, having returned much of its funds to customers such as George Soros, began investing the remaining 100 million dollars in areas where Niederhoffer later admitted that he did not have much expertise. Niederhoffer decided to buy Thai bank stocks, which had fallen heavily in the Asian financial crisis, his bet being that the Thai government would not allow these companies to go out of business. On October 27, 1997, losses resulting from this investment, combined with a 554-point (7.2%) single-day decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the eighthDaily Net Losses Milestones of the Dow Jones Average largest point decline to date in index history), forced Niederhoffer Investments to close its doors. In a lawsuit that Niederhoffer later filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where he traded options, he alleged that floor traders colluded to drive the market down that day to force him out of his positions. Traders at the time said Refco may have been responsible for as much as $35 million of Niederhoffer's losses. New fund Since closing down his fund in 1997, he began trading for his own account again in 1998, after mortgaging his house and selling his antique silver collection. This original fund is called Wimbledon Fund, the name reflecting his love of tennis. He began managing money for offshore clients in February 2002, with the Matador Fund. Niederhoffer employs proprietary computer programs that purports to predict short-term moves using multivariate time series analysis. In a five- year period beginning in 2001, Niederhoffer's fund returned 50% a year (compounded). His worst year in this period was 2004, returning 40%. In 2005, he returned 56.2% (as reported in eFinancial News). On April 6, 2006, the industry group MarHedge awarded Matador Fund Ltd. and Manchester Trading, two funds managed by Niederhoffer, the prize for best performance by a commodity trading advisor (CTA) in the two years 2004 and 2005. However, Niederhoffer's funds were caught up in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, and the Matador Fund was closed in September 2007 after a decline in value of more than seventy-five percent. From 2000 to 2003, Niederhoffer co-wrote with financial writer Laurel Kenner a weekly column on the markets for CNBC MoneyCentral. He and Kenner co-wrote Practical Speculation (John Wiley & Sons, February 2003), c.e. Niederhoffer's life story, and the lessons he learned, were told in the 1997 book The Education of a Speculator.  Squash  Niederhoffer was a winning hardball squash player and is a member of the squash hall of fame. Niederhoffer had never played squash when he entered Harvard University in 1960, but he had played other racquet sports. One year later, he won the national junior title, and, by the time he graduated, he was the National Intercollegiate squash champion. He won the U.S. Nationals five times (a record exceeded only by Stanley Pearson, who won his sixth in 1923). He also won three national doubles titles. In 1975, he defeated one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Sharif Khan, in the final of the North American Open (the only time that Khan failed to win the title in the 13-year period between 1969 and 1981). Other activities Niederhoffer is also the founder of the NYC Junto, a libertarian group hosted on the first Thursday of every month from 1985 to 2017. He is an enthusiast of Ayn Rand, and named two of his daughters Galt and Rand. The NYC Junto focuses on libertarianism, objectivism and investing and was inspired by the Junto hosted by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia from 1727 to 1757. He has six daughters and one son.

In 1980, he founded his hedge fund, Tudor Investment Corporation, an asset management firm headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Eight years later he founded the Robin Hood Foundation, which focuses on poverty reduction. Early life and education Jones was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Paul Tudor Jones II's father John Paul \\"Jack\\" Jones practiced transportation law from an office located next door to The Daily News, a publication his family has owned and operated since 1886 and where Jack Jones was the publisher for 34 years. Jones graduated from Presbyterian Day School, an all-boys elementary school, before attending Memphis University School for high school. Jones then went on to the University of Virginia where he was a welterweight boxing champion. While at the University of Virginia, Jones was president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. To pay for tuition, Jones wrote for his family's paper under the pseudonym Paul Eagle. In 1976, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia. In the 1980s, Jones was accepted to Harvard Business School but did not attend.  Career  = 1976 New York Cotton Exchange = In 1976, after graduating from the University of Virginia Jones asked his cousin William Dunavant Jr. for an introduction to trading. Dunavant was the CEO of Dunavant Enterprises, one of the world's largest cotton merchants. Dunavant sent Jones to talk with commodity broker Eli Tullis in New Orleans. Tullis represented some of the largest cotton traders in the world. Tullis hired Jones and mentored him in trading cotton futures at the New York Cotton Exchange. Eli Tullis fired Jones when he fell asleep at his desk after a night of partying in New Orleans. Many years later, Jones served as treasurer in 1986 and then as chairman of the New York Cotton Exchange from August 1992 through June 1995. = 1976‚Äï1980 E. F. Hutton & Co. = At 24 years old, Jones became a commodities broker for E. F. Hutton & Co. While working at E.F. Hutton Jones met, worked with and became friends with Glenn Dubin. = 1980‚Äîpresent: Tudor Investment Corporation = Jones' firm manages $7.8 billion (as of June 30, 2019). Their investment capabilities are broad and diverse, including global macro trading, fundamental equity investing in the U.S. and Europe, emerging markets, venture capital, commodities, event- driven strategies, and technical trading systems. The Tudor Group, consisting of Tudor Investment Corporation and its affiliates, is involved in active trading, investing, and research in assets across fixed income, currencies, equities, and commodities asset classes and related derivative and other instruments in the global markets for an international clientele. The investment strategies of the Tudor Group include, among others, discretionary global macro, quantitative global macro (managed futures), discretionary equity long/short, quantitative equity market neutral and growth equity. Fees - Although the hedge fund industry standard is two percent per annum of assets under management and twenty percent of the profits, Tudor Investment Corp. charges four percent per annum of assets under management and twenty-three percent of the profits. 1980 Founding - In 1980, Jones founded Tudor Investment Corporation, an asset management firm headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Dunavant and Tullis were among Tudor's first clients. In one of Princeton, New Jersey-based Commodities Corporation's first external investments, Jones had one of his first clients who was at the time a relatively unknown young quantity was provided $30,000 to manage. Tudor (i.e. Jones) used his experience in trading cotton to branch into to other commodities and financial instruments such as stock-index contracts and currency futures. 1987 Black Monday - One of Jones' earliest and major successes was predicting Black Monday in 1987, tripling his money during the event due to large short positions. In 1987, betting on a crash in the United States stock market Jones' Tudor' returned 125.9 percent after fees, earning an estimated $100 million. Peter Borish, second-in-command to Jones at Tudor Investment Corporation, anticipated the crash in 1987 by mapping the 1987 market against the market preceding the 1929 crash. 1990s - Tudor achieved greater liquidity and thereby flexibility through Jones' chairmanship of the NYCE's Finex subsidiary. Jones, with his colleague Hunt Taylor, was instrumental in the creation of FINEX, the financial futures division of the New York Board of Trade, and in the development of their U.S. dollar index futures contract. 1990 - In 1990, as the Japanese equities bubble was bursting, Jones returned 87.4 percent through shorting the market. 1991 - Jones closed the Tudor Select Fund, a futures fund, and returned investor capital. 1994 SEC Settlement - In 1994, Tudor paid a fine of $800,000 (the second highest at the time) to the SEC to settle allegations of violating (while not admitting or denying wrongdoing) the uptick rule, part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that prohibits the sale of a borrowed stock while the stock is declining. 2000s - In 2014, the New York Times noted that returns for Tudor clients had \\"dimmed\\" over the decade following Jones' \\"deliberate move to trade more conservatively, fewer big interest-rate and currency moves as central banks kept short-term rates near zero and more competition as the hedge fund universe has mushroomed. Investments = 2012 - Castleton Commodities International = In October 2012, it was announced that Glenn Dubin, Paul Tudor Jones and Timothy Barakett were among a group of investors buying the merchant energy operation Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy (\\"LDH Energy\\") from Louis Dreyfus Company and Highbridge Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund. The new company was named Castleton Commodities International, LLC. =Investment philosophy= As reported in Market Wizards and the press, Jones futures trading style and beliefs are as follows: * Contrarian attempt to buy and sell turning points. Keeps trying the single trade idea until he changes his mind, fundamentally. Otherwise, he keeps cutting his position size down. Then he trades the smallest amount when his trading is at its worst. * Considers himself as a premier market opportunist. When he develops an idea, he pursues it from a very-low-risk standpoint until he has been proven wrong repeatedly, or until he changes his viewpoint. * Swing trader, the best money is made at the market turns. Has missed a lot of meat in the middle, but catches a lot of tops and bottoms. * Spends his day making himself happy and relaxed. Gets out of a losing position that is making him uncomfortable. Nothing's better than a fresh start. Key is to play great defense, not great offense. * Never average losers. Decreases his trading size when he is doing poorly, increase when he is trading well. * He has mental stops. If it hits that number, he is out no matter what. He uses not only price stops, but time stops. * Monitors the whole portfolio equity (risk) in real time. * He believes prices move first and fundamentals come second. * He doesn't care about mistakes made three seconds ago, but what he is going to do from the next moment on. * Don't be a hero. Don't have an ego. Always question yourself and your ability. Don't ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead. Jones's global macro trading style is based primarily on technical analysis, as opposed to value investing, with an emphasis momentum factors driving markets. In a 2000 interview, he suggested however he regretted not being more involved with venture investing in technology firms during the 1990s. Wealth As of November 2019, Forbes Magazine estimated his net worth to be US$5.3 billion, making him the 343rd richest person on the Forbes 400 and the 7th highest- earning hedge fund manager. Giving Pledge - In 2019, Tudor Jones and his wife joined the Giving Pledge. When Tudor Jones and his wife joined the Giving Pledge, they said \\"we were both raised in the Church,\\" and cited several Bible references. Residencies - Jones lives in Greenwich, CT. Conservation Destroying Wetlands - In 1990, Jones pleaded guilty to illegally destroying 86 acres of protected wetlands on his Maryland Eastern Shore hunting estate with 1,400 cubic yards of gravel, without a permit. Jones was ordered to pay $1 million fine and $1 million in restitution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and by pleading guilty avoided a possible one-year jail term for violating the Federal Clean Water Act. Everglades Foundation - In 1993, Jones co-founded the Everglades Foundation, which advocates for conservation of the Everglades, tropical wetlands in Florida. He chairs the organization's board, which includes Jimmy Buffett, Jack Nicklaus, David Lawrence Jr., Jon L. Mills, and William Wrigley Jr. II, among others. American conservationist - In 2006, the New York Times described Jones as an American conservationist in reporting that in 2002, the Tanzanian government leased him the Grumeti reserve in Tanzania's western Serengeti. The New York Times explains the conservation reporting \\"The reserves are really three contiguous hunting blocks with Sasakwa at the center: Grumeti Game Reserve, Fort Ikoma Open Area and Ikorongo Game Reserve. Hunting blocks are supposed to generate income for the central government and local districts through the sale of hunting licenses and trophy fees. Grumeti Reserves would make no financial sense, as far as the government is concerned, if the hunting revenues from these blocks simply vanished. Jones‚Äôs solution has been to pay the hunting fees and nearly eliminate hunting.\\" Philanthropy =Underprivileged student graduation rates= 1986 adopts sixth grade class - In 1986, after watching an episode of CBS News' 60 Minutes Jones adopted a sixth grade class in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn at an underperforming public school by guaranteeing college scholarships to students that graduated from high school. His idea was this would be an incentive to students to engage in academics with his goal being that 90% of those students successfully complete high school. However, only 33% of the students in the class eventually graduated from high school. Jones believed he \\"vastly underestimated both the academic and social challenges facing [the students in the class he adopted]\\" and his program was \\"completely ill- equipped to [help them] in an efficient fashion.\\" In his 2009 speech, Jones explained that this major failure on his part taught him lessons he's applied in subsequent education efforts. In 2009, Jones delivered a commencement speech at the Buckley School about his experiences with failure and comebacks. He talked about failing to get 86 underserved students into college despite expense and effort later helped him start one of the most successful charter schools in New York. 2004 founds charter school - In 2004, Jones founded the Excellence Charter School, the country's first all-boys charter school, located in the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. He founded and chaired the Bedford Stuyvesant I Have A Dream Foundation, which puts local students in colleges. =University of Virginia giving= Tudor Jones gave $44 million to his alma mater, the University of Virginia, for a sports and concert arena which the university named after his father. Jones has made large donations to his alma mater, the University of Virginia, including a $44 million donation, which went to the construction of a new basketball arena, named the John Paul Jones Arena, in honor of his father, an attorney who also attended the University of Virginia. In April 2012, UVA announced the creation of a new Contemplative Sciences Center through a $12 million gift from Jones and his wife, Sonia. =Robin Hood Foundation= Jones is the founder of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City. Backed mainly by hedge fund operators. Other founding members include Peter Borish and Glenn Dubin. =Just Capital= He set up the nonprofit Just Capital to help Americans learn about companies that are considered \\"just\\". The organization uses data to discover which companies are most involved with the priorities Americans find most important. The nonprofit uses an annual, multi- phase survey to find out what these priorities are. Just Capital also operates a for profit ETF (exchange traded fund) comprising only companies believed to be \\"just\\".  Controversy  2012 Ousting of University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan - In June 2012, he was reportedly a key figure in the controversial ousting of University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan. He penned an editorial supporting her resignation. On June 26, 2012, The University of Virginia Board of Visitors unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan. 2013: Remarks on female traders - In 2013, the Washington Post posted a video to their site showing Jones at an April 2013 closed door investment roundtable at the University of Virginia responding to a question on the lack of diversity on the panel. Jones answered saying that having a baby hurts the ability of women to focus on macro trading, where investors seek to profit from global equity, bond, currency and commodities markets. The soundbite from Jones' five minute answer that received attention was: \\"As soon as that baby‚Äôs lips touched that girl‚Äôs bosom, forget it\\". The Washington Post reported Jones' answer as meaning that: female traders are just as capable as male traders, but he believes they lose their focus once they become mothers. Jones' comments quickly drew criticism from fellow traders, members of the media and others regarding mothers in his field of global macro trading. Jones apologized soon afterwards which did not cease the criticism he received. Jones in a written statement sent to the Washington Post Jones stated that \\"My off-the-cuff remarks at the University of Virginia were with regard to global macro traders, who are on-call 24/7 and of whom there are likely only a few thousand successful practitioners in the world today. Macro trading requires a high degree of skill, focus and repetition. Life events, such as birth, divorce, death of a loved one and other emotional highs and lows are obstacles to success in this specific field of finance.\\" 2017: Harvey Weinstein friendship - Jones was a friend of now convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein and a member of the board of The Weinstein Company. In 2017, as Weinstein came under increasing pressure, Jones wrote him an email saying, \\"I love you\\", provided encouragement that the scrutiny would soon end, and advised him on how he could revive his reputation.https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-tudor- jones-says-its-good-news-everyone-will-forget-about-harvey- weinstein-2017-12https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/paul- tudor-jones-told-weinstein-sex-allegations-would-blow-over Jones distanced himself from Weinstein in a written statement, \\"Harvey was a friend I believed too long and defended too long.\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/paul-tudor- jones-distances-himself-from-harvey-weinstein.html Reputation 1987 PBS Trader documentary - In 1987, PBS produced a documentary entitled 'Trader' which focused on Jones's activities. The film shows Jones as a young man predicting the 1987 crash, using methods similar to those of market forecaster Robert Prechter. Although the video was shown on public television in November 1987, few copies exist. When copies surface, Jones attempts to buy them up. According to Michael Glyn, the video's director, Jones requested in the 1990s that the documentary be removed from circulation. The video has surfaced from time to time on different video sharing and torrent sites, but has often been taken down shortly thereafter due to copyright claims. Various theories exist as to why Jones does not support the film. Despite the film's showing a positive approach to risk and client care, as well as showcasing Jones's charity work, it has been suggested that the film may reveal trading secrets. As trader - In 1988, at the age of 33, \\"The Wall Street Journal dedicated a front-page story to Jones, calling him ‚Äúthe most-watched, most-talked-about man on Wall Street.‚Äù\\" Low profile within financial media circles beginning in the late 1980s through to a report in 1997, Jones kept interviews with financial reporters to a minimum; while keeping a low profile in financial circles he was visible appearing on Larry King Live, promoting his Save Our Everglades campaign and the Robin Hood Foundation. In 2019, Reuters has described Jones as ‚Äòone of the giants‚Äô and reported that Jones is considered a legend among macro traders. Legacy and awards - In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen. In 2019, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, presented by Awards Council member Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, during the International Achievement Summit in New York City. Personal life By the mid-1980s, Jones as reported by Institutional Investor magazine was \\"developing a reputation for courting models and partying long into the night\\" and the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page article referring to Jones as Quotron Man in a profile covering his lifestyle. This was transpiring in 1987, as there was a general backlash against excesses on Wall Street. In 1988, Jones married Australian-born Sonia Klein, a New York‚Äìbased yoga entrepreneur at a wedding in Memphis. In the early 1990s, Jones moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. They have four children ‚Äî Caroline, Dorothy \\"Dottie\\", Chrissy, and Jack. Jones has encouraged his three daughters to go into macro trading. Politics & Associations A political independent, Jones has donated money to numerous Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2012 he donated $200,000 to Mitt Romney. During the 2008 presidential election, Jones hosted a 500-person fundraiser at his Greenwich home for then- candidate Barack Obama. Jones also donated to John McCain and Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaigns. Jones previously served as a director of the Futures Industry Association and was instrumental in the creation and development of an education-arm for the association‚Äîthe then Futures Industry Institute, a research institute later renamed the Institute for Financial Markets based in Washington D.C. Mr. Jones was also an advocate for the design and implementation of the first ethics training course that became the standard for exchange membership on all futures exchanges in the United States.

The name derives from Duffel, a town in the province of Antwerp in Belgium where the fabric originated. Duffel bags were originally made from the same material. The hood and toggle fastenings proved popular, and the coat spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was being supplied to the British Royal Navy. After World War II, the coats became available as government surplus stock and became popular, especially with students. Description There are many variations of duffel coat. The basic British style features: * Genuine double weave woolen duffel fabric, lined with a woolly tartan pattern, or plain in the military version. * Three or, later, four front wooden or horn toggle and leather fastenings. * Two large outside patch pockets, with covering flaps on post-war versions. * Originally knee length; shorter on later versions. * A buttonable neck strap. * Bucket hood with press stud adjustment. Later versions feature a neater \\"pancake\\" hood. The toggle-fastenings are made to be easily fastened and unfastened while wearing gloves in cold weather. Current designs often feature imitation plastic buffalo horn. The original hood was oversized to allow room for a Naval cap. Early versions were knee-length but later ones were shorter. History The initial influence of what became the duffel coat, may have been the hooded Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. It had the unusual features of a toggle closure and an integrated hood,\\"Polish Frock Coat at around 1850\\", \\"...with toggles & hood.\\" and by 1850 had spread through Europe.\\"Duffle coat history\\" Gentleman's Gazette In the 1850s, British outerwear manufacturer John Partridge developed the first version of the duffle coat.\\"Duffle coat\\", Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion In the 1890s the British Admiralty purchased the coat in quantity for the Royal Navy from multiple manufacturers,\\"Heritage, originalmontgomery.co.uk where it was referred to as the \\"convoy coat\\".Taylor, Theodore, 2007.

The Monty at cabourn.comThe classic we can't bear to be without at telegraph.co.uk Large post-war stocks of low-cost military surplus coats turned the duffel into a ubiquitous item of British civilian clothing in the 1950s and 1960s, especially among students. The firm Gloverall purchased large quantities, and in 1954 started producing their own version using leather fastenings and buffalo horn toggles with a double-faced check lining, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features. Today A contemporary duffle- style coatToday, the duffel coat is often made of Melton cloth, as opposed to modern duffel cloth which is a softer wool fabric with a distinct nap, used for high-end coats and parkas. In Italy as well as in Greece, the duffle coat is called a Montgomery, after Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who often wore one during World War II.

The mall extends approximately from George Street to Edward Street, and has more than 700 retailers over of retail space, which includes six major shopping centres. It receives over 26 million visitors each year. It was intended to bring more people into the central business district. History Facadism, such as this example at the Myer Centre, helped to preserve some Victorian era building facades along the Queen Street Mall. The mall was designed by Robin Gibson (architect). After being closed to traffic in 1981, the initial pedestrian mall was opened in 1982, in order to be ready for the Brisbane Commonwealth Games. Initially, the section of Queen Street between Albert Street and Edward Street was partitioned off to form a pedestrian-only retail precinct, and it was then extended in 1988 to include the section of Queen Street between Albert Street and George Street, timed to coincide with Brisbane's Expo '88. The mall underwent a $25,000,000 refurbishment in 1999, which saw (among other things) the terracotta paving being replaced by granite.Queen Street Mall - the heart of Brisbane The Albert Street section of the mall was refurbished again in 2007. The Brisbane City Council announced in 2009 that Burnett Lane, a narrow laneway that runs between George Street and Albert Street, and parallel to the mall, would be refurbished and integrated into the Queen Street Mall precinct. =2013 siege= On 8 March 2013, the mall was the scene of a 90 minute siege. The offender, Lee Matthew Hillier, had a long criminal history. He was shot several times with non-lethal rounds, ending the incident. He pled guilty to charges including assaulting police and going armed to cause fear. In January 2014 he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail. Features Intersection of Queen Street and Albert Street in 2004 There are a number of shopping centres located in the Queen Street Mall, including: * Wintergarden (opened 1982), * The Myer Centre (opened 1988), * Broadway on the Mall (opened 1989), * Queens Plaza (opened 2005), * Brisbane Arcade (opened 1923), * Q&A; Building, * Queen Adelaide Building, * Tattersall's Arcade At the intersection of Queen Street and Albert Street at the centre of the mall is a steel structure designed to provide shade and cover from the weather. An entertainment stage for music, model shows, and other performances is situated near the George Street end of the mall, between the Myer Centre and the Queen Adelaide Building. The stage is covered by an roof. Underneath the Queen Street Mall is the Queen Street Bus Station.Queen Street Bus Station map In the development of stage one and stage two of the mall, significant heritage- listed building facades were preserved, giving the mall a restored yesteryear feeling. Shopping Centres There are several significant shopping centres located on the Queen Street Mall. These include the Wintergarden (opened in 1982), The Myer Centre (opened in 1988), Broadway on the Mall (opened in 1989) and the lavish Queens Plaza, situated at the northern end of the mall, which was opened in two stages, the first in 2005, and the second in 2008.Queen Street Mall .

Early life and background Sorcar was born on November 29, 1944. He is the eldest son of legendary Indian magician, the late P.C. SorcarManick Sorcar Wins for Rule of Twenty-One (The Statesman, 2004) and Basanti Devi. He has two older sisters, Ila and Gita, and two younger brothers Prodip and Provas, both of whom are magicians. He is married to Shikha Devi and has two daughters, Piya and Payal. In his youth, Sorcar was a stage assistant for his father's world-touring magic shows, where he also painted backdrops and designed the stage lighting. He chose not to pursue magic as a career as he was more interested in lighting and art, in which he also saw forms of magic. After receiving his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering (first class) from the Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, he wanted to see more of the world and came to the United States to pursue higher education in lighting technology and to practice art. He earned his master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington.Animate Magic (The Hindu, 2006) Career =Engineering= Sorcar started his professional career as an engineer at Howard W. Butterweck and Company, an electrical consulting engineering firm in Denver, Colorado. After two years, he became a partner, and the firm changed its name to Butterweck-Sorcar Engineering, which later became Sorcar Engineering. Over the course of 40 years under Sorcar's leadership, the company flourished, and completed numerous multimillion-dollar projects, including the Denver International Airport, the Colorado Convention Center, and several sport centers in Japan and Saudi Arabian palaces. During this time, Sorcar authored three widely-used books on lighting design, used as textbooks in US and Indian universities. =Laser art and animation= Sorcar first shot to fame in the nineties when his Deepa & Rupa: A Fairy Tale from India, India's first animation mixed with live action, received the Gold Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1990 and was nominated for an Emmy Award 1991 Emmy Nominees in 1991, and The Sage and the Mouse won the Gold Medal at the International Film Festival of New YorkManick Sorcar: Building bridges through art and animation (OnlyPunjab.com, 2005) in 1993.

Gimson assumed the post of the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong in December 1941. However, his appointment was interrupted by the Battle of Hong Kong. He became a prisoner of war when then Governor Sir Mark Young surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army on Christmas Day 1941. After spending more than three years in Stanley Internment Camp as an internee, Gimson was freed in August 1945, upon the Liberation of Hong Kong. He formed a short-lived provisional government and briefly declared himself \\"acting governor\\", but this administration was soon replaced when Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt established the military government following in September. Gimson was the first Governor of Singapore from 1946 to 1952 and reinstalled the civil administration in Singapore. During his governorship, he witnessed the establishment of the legislative council and the executive council in 1947. His governorship was also marked by the increasingly unstable political situation which was provoked by the Malayan Emergency, and the controversial legislation of the Internal Security Act. Biography =Early life= Gimson was born on 10 September 1890 in Barrow-on-Soar, Leicestershire, England, to the Rev. Charles Keightley Gimson. He attended Balliol College, Oxford, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. =Early colonial service= Gimson entered the British Ceylon Civil Service as a cadet in November 1914. In the beginning he was attached to the Office of the Naval Intelligence Officer in addition to his own duties. Later on he became an additional police magistrate in Colombo. In 1918 he was sent on military service during World War I and returned to the colonial administration as an additional assistant colonial secretary in July 1919. Two months later he was transferred to North Central Province as assistant government agent. Gimson was appointed additional assistant colonial secretary for the second time in March 1920 and was promoted to the post of 4th assistant colonial secretary in September 1920. Subsequently, he was sent to Mannar as acting assistant government agent in February 1922. In February 1924, he was promoted to the Customs Department as landing surveyor and acted as acting deputy controller from March to May in 1928. Gimson left the Customs in March 1929 and was appointed as an additional assistant to the Director of Education. Later in July 1931 he became secretary to the Minister of Education. In February 1932, Gimson was appointed assistant government agent of Trincomalee and in December 1933, appointed assistant government agent of Kegalle. In August 1935, he involved in a special duty to help organise the forthcoming general election of members of the state council. Afterwards, he was appointed the chairman of the Municipal Council of Kandy in June 1936 but was eventually given the post of Controller of Labour in 1937. Gimson held this office until 1941 and he gained the rank of class one officer in 1938. =Life as colonial secretary and internment in Hong Kong= Gimson was promoted to the post of Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1941 and arrived at the colony on 7 December, just the day before the Japanese Army initiated its unexpected and sudden large-scale invasion to Hong Kong. The defence forces of Hong Kong soon lost in the Battle of Hong Kong and the then governor, Sir Mark Young, was forced to surrender on 25 December, which is now known as the Black Christmas. After the Japanese victory, all British officials were arrested and were under Japanese rule. Since the Governor was interned elsewhere, Gimson became the representative of the former government who was responsible for dealing with the Japanese over the issue of transfer of power. For some time he even set up a provisional liaison office in Prince's Building, Central. In March 1942, Gimson was finally sent to Stanley Internment Camp, where most British colonial officials and expatriates were interned. During the internment, the British civilian internees established the \\"British Communal Council\\", which tried in a limited way to maintain the life and order in the camp. As the highest-ranking British official in the camp, Gimson became the chairman of the council and was also responsible to negotiate with the Japanese on matters relating to the camp. After three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, the Emperor of Japan finally announced an unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945. Immediately after the unconditional surrender was made, the Japanese authority had to continue to maintain the order of Hong Kong as the Allies were still on the way to take over. However, all the prohibitions and regulations set by the Japanese were entirely lifted and abolished instantly. On the other hand, on the eve of the surrender of Japan, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Horace Seymour, had already tried to make contact with Gimson from Chongqing, urging him to exercise the sovereignty on behalf of the British government. Although Seymour's order arrived late on 23 August, Gimson had declared himself \\"acting governor\\" and had started to prepare for a \\"provisional government\\" on 16 August after knowing Japanese had surrendered. Receiving Seymour's order on 23 August, Gimson and other internees left the camp and took over the authority from Japan. Gimson was sworn as acting governor by Chief Justice Atholl MacGregor. He and other former colonial officials set up the headquarters of the provisional government in the Former French Mission Building. On 27 August, Gimson made a further announcement through radio, stating the provisional government had been established. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the provisional rule, the government had to rely on the Japanese troops to maintain the order of Hong Kong since the power of the administration was limited. On 30 August 1945, Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt and his warships entered Victoria Harbour. Since Harcourt was asked to form a military government by London, Gimson transferred the power to him and the military government was officially formed on 1 September. Harcourt himself became the head of the military government and Gimson was appointed lieutenant governor by him. Yet, the creation of the office of lieutenant governor was deemed unsuitable by the Colonial Office and therefore Gimson was soon replaced by a chief civil affairs officer and his team sent from London on 7 September. Gimson himself was in fact in poor health as a result of more than three years of internment. For health reasons, he left for the United Kingdom on 16 September. On the day before his departure, he commented in a radio programme that Hong Kong should undergo political reform in the future. =Governor of Singapore= After spending some time recovering in the United Kingdom, Gimson became governor and commander-in-chief of Singapore on 1 April 1946. He abolished the military government which had been set up by Lord Louis Mountbatten (as he then was) in 1945, and reinstalled the colonial civil administration. In the first two years of his governorship, the recovery of the economy in Singapore was slow and a large riot broke out in 1947. In June 1947, Singapore became a separate Crown colony and both legislative and executive councils of Singapore were established. In March 1948, Gimson allowed six of the twenty-five seats in the legislative council to be elected. In June 1948, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya broke out, and the British imposed harsh measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya; the controversial Internal Security Act, which allowed indefinite detention without trial for persons suspected of being \\"threats to security\\", was introduced at this time. Since the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government stalled for several years. The colonial government also tried to prevent contact between Singaporean Chinese and the People's Republic of China, which had just fallen under the rule of the Communist Party of China. Tan Kah Kee, a local businessman and philanthropist, was denied re-entry into Singapore after he made a trip to China in 1949. In April 1950, Gimson was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt: as he left a boxing event at which he had been presenting prizes in Singapore, a grenade was thrown at him which bounced off his leg and exploded harmlessly some distance away.MIDNIGHT BOMB ATTACK ON GIMSON, The Straits Times, 29 April 1950, Page 1. A second legislative council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine but the colonial administration was still obviously dominant. Gimson retired from the colonial service the following year, leaving Singapore on the P&O; Liner Corfu on 20 March 1952. He was succeeded in the post of governor by John Nicoll, another former Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong. =Later years= Gimson spent his time back in the United Kingdom in retirement. He died in his house, \\"Applegarth\\", in Thornton-le-Dale, near Pickering, North Yorkshire, on 13 February 1975, aged 84. Family Gimson married Margaret Dorothy Ward in 1922. She was appointed in the 1936 New Year Honours for services during a malaria epidemic in Ceylon. The couple had two daughters.

On propeller aircraft, there is a difference in the remaining yawing moments after failure of the left or the right (outboard) engine when all propellers rotate in the same direction due to the P-factor. On turbojet and turbofan aircraft, there usually is no difference between the yawing moments after failure of a left or right engine.  Description  When one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust imbalance exists between the operative and inoperative sides of the aircraft. This thrust imbalance causes several negative effects in addition to the loss of one engine's thrust. The tail- design engineer is responsible for determining the size of vertical stabilizer that will comply with the regulatory requirements for the control and performance of an aircraft after engine failure, such as those set by the Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency. The experimental test pilot and flight-test engineer determine which of the engines is the critical engine during testing.  Factors affecting engine criticality  = Asymmetrical yaw = When one engine fails, a yawing moment develops, which applies a rotational force to the aircraft that tends to turn it toward the wing that carries the engine that failed. A rolling moment might develop, due to the asymmetry of the lift in each wing, with a greater lift generated by the wing with the operating engine. The yawing and rolling moments apply rotational forces that tend to yaw and roll the aircraft towards the failed engine. This tendency is counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls, which include the rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's center of gravity than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger deflections of the flight controls or a higher speed in order to maintain control of the aircraft. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine has a greater impact than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called the critical engine. On aircraft with propellers that rotate counter-clockwise, such as the de Havilland Dove, the right engine would be the critical engine. Most aircraft that have counter-rotating propellers do not have a critical engine defined by the above mechanism, because the two propellers are made to rotate inward from the top of the arc; both engines are critical. Some aircraft, such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, purposefully have propellers that rotate outward from the top of the arc, to reduce downward air turbulence, known as downwash, on the central horizontal stabilizer, which makes it easier to fire guns from the aircraft. These engines are both critical, but more critical than inward-rotating propellers. Aircraft with propellers in a push-pull configuration, such as the Cessna 337, may have a critical engine, if failure of one engine has a greater negative effect on aircraft control or climb performance than failure of the other engine. The failure of a critical engine in an aircraft with propellers in a push-pull configuration typically will not generate large yawing or rolling moments. Fig. 1. With clockwise-rotating propellers (as seen by the pilot), the operating right-hand engine will produce a more severe yawing moment towards the dead engine, thus making the failure of the left-hand engine critical =Effect of the critical engine on minimum control speed= The standards and certifications that specify airworthiness require that the manufacturer determine a minimum control speed (VMC) at which a pilot can retain control of the aircraft after failure of the critical engine, and publish this speed in the section of the airplane flight manual on limitations. The published minimum control speeds (VMCs) of the aircraft are measured when the critical engine fails or is inoperative, so the effect of the failure of the critical engine is included in the published VMCs. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual VMC that the pilot experiences in flight will be slightly lower, which is safer, but this difference is not documented in the manual. The critical engine is one of the factors that influences the VMCs of the aircraft. The published VMCs are safe regardless of which engine fails or is inoperative, and pilots do not need to know which engine is critical in order to safely fly. The critical engine is defined in aviation regulations for the purpose of designing the tail, and for experimental test pilots to measure VMCs in flight. Other factors like bank angle and thrust have a much greater effect on VMCs than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine. The Airbus A400M has an atypical design, because it has counter-rotating propellers on both wings. The propellers on a wing rotate in opposite directions to each other: the propellers rotate from the top of the arc downward toward each other. If both engines on a wing are operative, the shift of the thrust vector with increasing angle of attack is always towards the other engine on the same wing. The effect is that the resultant thrust vector of both engines on the same wing does not shift as the angle of attack of the airplane increases as long as both engines are operating. There is no total P-factor, and failure of either outboard engine (i.e.: engines 1 or 4) will result in no difference in magnitude of the remaining thrust yawing moments with increasing angle of attack, only in the direction left or right. The minimum control speed during takeoff (VMC) and during flight (VMCA) after failure of either one of the outboard engines will be the same unless boosting systems that may be required for controlling the airplane are installed on only one of the outboard engines. Both outboard engines would be critical. Figure 2. A400M, counter-rotating propellers on each wing; the most important yawing moments after failure of engine 1 If an outboard engine fails, such as engine 1 as shown in Figure 2, the moment arm of the vector of the remaining thrust on that wing moves from in between the engines to a bit outside of the remaining inboard engine. The vector itself is 50% of the opposite thrust vector. The resulting thrust yawing moment is much smaller in this case than for conventional propeller rotation. The maximum rudder yawing moment to counteract the asymmetrical thrust can be smaller and, consequently, the size of the vertical tail can be smaller. The feathering system of the large, 8-bladed, 17.5-foot (5.33 m) diameter drag propellers must be automatic, very rapid and failure-free, to ensure the lowest possible propeller drag following a propulsion-system malfunction. If not, a failure of the feathering system of an outboard engine will increase propeller drag, which in turn enhances the thrust yawing moment considerably, thus increasing actual VMC(A). The control power generated by the small vertical tail and rudder alone is low by the small design. Only rapid reduction of thrust of the opposite engine, or increased airspeed can restore the required control power to maintain straight flight following the failure of a feathering system. Designing and approving the feathering system for this airplane is challenging for design engineers and certification authorities. On airplanes with very powerful engines, the problem of asymmetrical thrust is solved by applying automatic thrust asymmetry compensation, but this has consequences for takeoff performance. Elimination The Rutan Boomerang is an asymmetrical aircraft designed with engines with slightly different power outputs to produce an aircraft that eliminates the dangers of asymmetric thrust in the event of failure of either of its two engines.

Founded in 1984Â§ßÊó•Â¶Ç‰æÜ. ÂæûÂºµÁßÄÈúûÁúãÊ∏ÖÊ•öÁõßÂãùÂΩ•. blogspot.com, 29 December 2012. [2019-03-04]., the founder of this sect is Lu Sheng-yen (ÁõßÂãùÂΩ•), often referred to by his followers as a tulku, a Tibetan term for a reincarnated teacher or deity. He is called the Root Guru by his disciples. Lu claims to be a fully enlightened buddha, known by his disciples as \\"Living Buddha Lian-sheng\\" (ËìÆÁîüÊ¥ª‰Ωõ). He is a writer who has written approximately 232 books to date. As of Feb of 2013, the organization claims over 5,000,000 became Buddhists through Lu. Ling Shen Ching Tze Temple in Redmond, Washington, the head temple of the TBS. Teachings  Members of the True Buddha School emphasize the necessity to cultivate diligently for the benefit of spiritual advancement, as is practiced in general Vajrayana Buddhism. This is done through empowerment directly from the Root Guru, who himself proclaims to be an emanated being from the Pure Lands shed directly from Vairocana Buddha, then later achieving enlightenment in the human realm through his own rigorous practice and after being given several empowerments from other buddhas and bodhisattvas. A Tantric Buddhist practitioner cannot rely solely on listening or reading spiritual doctrines, or simply worshiping and paying respect to buddhas and bodhisattvas as the method to achieve the goal of spiritual liberation. All students are expected to follow the fourteen Root Tantric Vows (known as Vajrayana samaya) along with the Five Precepts that all Buddhists should follow, and to respect the Root Guru. There is a structured curriculum to guide the student's practice, and at each level, a specific yoga is practiced. To advance to the next level, the student must achieve yogic response from the yoga being practiced in the current level and receive empowerment for the yoga of the next level. As a beginner, there are specific yogas that are practiced to establish a strong foundation. The yoga practiced in the first stage is Vajrasattva yoga, a great repentance yoga to purify bad karma. The next level is Guru Yoga, followed by Personal Deity yoga and then the inner body practices of energy yoga.  Worldwide chapters  True Buddha School has chapters across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America, though the size of each local chapter varies. The main temple is located in Redmond, Washington, it also served as the main residence where Lu resided while he was living in United States. He lived in Tahiti with his wife Lian Hsiang in solitude for six years before re-emerging in the US in 2006, returning to his home in Redmond. The majority of the followers of the True Buddha School are located in Asia, and many devotees are from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. Across North America, Australia, and Europe, the majority of the students are immigrants of Asian descent. True Buddha School's funding relies heavily on donations. This is supplemented with the income from the publication of Lu's books and videos of his sermons. The money is used to publish its teaching materials and for charity work such as the South Asian tsunami relief effort. True Buddha School disseminates Buddhist teachings through Lu's sermons, books and articles. These materials are supplemented with sermons and articles by other acharyas (other gurus) certified by the grand master. Lu's books are mainly published in Chinese, with a limited number currently being translated into English. However, more translations are slowly being made to reach a wider audience. Many of the major True Buddha School sadhanas (liturgies) and practices are available in English. Objection Venerable Hsuan Hua warned his disciples about Lu Sheng-yen's claims, lamenting that many modern people lack wisdom, and dismissing Lu by saying, \\"I don't know what this person is. I call him a demon runt.\\" Lu was criticized for eating meat, drinking alcohol, and \\"playing around with women.\\" Despite being the largest Vajrayana sect in Taiwan, the True Buddha School has been criticized by six Buddhist organizations in Malaysia.

It was founded in August 1986. ILDA sponsors an annual conference and the annual ILDA Awards for artistic and technical achievement in laser shows and displays. While increasing public awareness of laser light shows, the ILDA is also an association that provides a base for laser display companies. The ILDA does not perform laser light shows itself, but its members primarily consist of laser light show hosts or companies that sell equipment and services. Members of the company can work with each other, not as competitors, but as colleagues with whom they can collaborate. Being associated with ILDA, members can have professional backing that will supply information on new technologies regarding safety issues and improved display performance.  ILDA History  ILDA was founded on August 16, 1986, at their first organizational meeting in Lake Tahoe. Those founding members who are still active as of 2006 are Tom Harman of LaserNet, Jim Martin of Peachtree Lase, Walt Meador of Laser Rentals, Inc., Todd Rogers of Beamin‚Äô Lasers, and Tim Walsh of Laser Spectacles. Originally, the meeting was labeled a gathering of Laser Entertainment Professionals. The first topics that were covered at the meeting were ethical business standards, quality shows, CDRH, insurance, standardization, market overview, mission statement, and many more. The first officers were Ron Goldstein as President, Walt Meador as Secretary, and Tim Walsh as Treasurer. At the end of the meeting, each company was able to show off their own laser light creations. The most memorable display was when Laser Media and Image Engineering performed their collaboration to prove that cooperation between laser light companies was possible. In April 2006, the ILDA lobbied for the rights to sell lasers for informational display and/or entertainment. This requires persuading the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH; www.FDA.gov/cdrh) to update the administrative process and ensure laser light shows and displays are safer for the public. Whilst ILDA membership is open to laserists from all countries, ILDA is in essence an American organization that adheres to American laws and standards of safety. Laser safety is imperative where and whenever lasers are being used in public, however laser safety laws in countries with overbearing bureaucractic indulgence i.e. The US inhibit laser professionals from using the technology in a creative fashion.  ILDA Image Transfer Format  The International Laser Display Association developed an image format suitable for interchanging image data between laser controllers and laser fixtures. The information may also be stored as frames, which can then be stored on a computer or other controlling device. Companies in charge of the technical committee of ILDA are LaserMedia, Image Engineering, Foresight, and Laser Dream. Since ILDA's inception in the early 1990s, profit for large laser display companies, which developed the art form from existing technology, have plummeted. This may be because the technology has become more widespread and affordable  ILDA Connector  ILDA specifies a hardware interface used to control laser projectors. ISP-DB25 is a DB-25 connector governing the X/Y servo position, per-color output, safety isolators etc.  ILDA Annual Conference and Award Ceremony  Every year, the ILDA sponsors a conference and award Ceremony since 1988. These conferences give digital media light show artists the opportunity to network, and showcase their most recent work, while the Award Ceremonies are a place for members to advertise and promote their artistic talent. Companies who have won the most awards are LOBO Electronic, Audio Visual Imagineering, LFI/Laser Fantasy International, Laser Images Inc. (‚ÄúLaserium‚Äù) and Laser Medium. Awards include several different Artistic categories and the Fenning Award, which credits technical achievement. But the highest honor of all is the Career Achievement Award, which is based on years of success, innovation, and over all quality of work. The ILDA Conference started in 1987 and ILDA members and non-members can both participate. The Conference holds the ILDA Awards announcements, the Advanced Technology Workshop, a performance of light shows called the ‚ÄúLase-off,‚Äù and seminar and business meetings.

A second series was broadcast in 2005 with a third starting on 24 May 2007. The series became adapted for television as That Mitchell and Webb Look in 2006. The series is seen in some ways a follow-up to The Mitchell and Webb Situation, a sketch show shown on Play UK in 2001. That Mitchell and Webb Sound returned to BBC Radio 4 for a fourth series in 2009, the first episode broadcasting on 25 August 2009. A fifth series was announced in September 2013, and began transmission on 26 November 2013. The series stars David Mitchell and Robert Webb who also write a fair amount of the material. The cast includes frequent Mitchell and Webb collaborators James Bachman and Olivia Colman. Sarah Hadland joined the cast for the fourth series. Apart from Mitchell and Webb, a fair proportion of the sketches are written by the other cast members and other writers. These include Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain (the writers of Peep Show, in which Mitchell and Webb star), Mark Evans, David Quantick, Jonathan Dryden Taylor, Toby Davies, Simon Kane and John Finnemore. It is produced by Gareth Edwards. Recurring sketches The series has no fixed format but there are a number of recurring scenarios and sketch formats. Most of the recurring characters appear in the first two series. * Ted and Peter - a parody of television snooker commentary. Ted and Peter (Mitchell and Webb respectively) are a pair of jaded ex-players, whose voiceover trails off from describing the game, revealing more than they should about their personal lives and the murky behind-the-scenes, hard- drinking, hard-fighting, dog-eat-dog world of the sport and its commentators. Although the stories generally featured fictional snooker players, they were non-the-less allegories of 'characters' of the sport such as Alex Higgins. * Friends Of... - Mitchell and Webb prepare a party guest list, and realise that one of the guests will bring along a famous literary, film, TV or historical figure (though the duo are unaware of the guest's fame in the context of the sketches). An extra twist is that positive figures are usually described as party wreckers and infamous figures are celebrated. The arrival of James Bond is dreaded (\\"So I say, 'Do you want a glass of wine, James, or there's beer in the fridge?' Prat asks for a martini!\\") while Hitler is welcomed (\\"Oh, I do love it when he goes off on one\\"). Other guests have included Darth Vader, June Sarpong, Dr Jekyll and the Mystery Inc. gang of Scooby-Doo. * Imagine That - A parody of intelligent panel shows. A set of intellectuals are asked to conceive of various bizarre ideas, such as \\"the biggest jacket potato they can think of.\\" One episode was mistakenly called \\"Imagine Hat\\", due to \\"a printing error in the Radio Times,\\" which the host decides to take as a challenge. The panellists therefore had to imagine a hat. Mitchell's character, Professor David Trussell, is slightly deranged. This is the only recurring sketch to appear in the first three series. * Big Talk - Host Raymond Terrific (Webb) shouts at his panel of \\"boffins,\\" demanding they solve the world's problems. *Adrian Locket - Adrian (Mitchell) is a weary late-night local radio DJ who harbours no illusions about his audience. His life is about as lonely and dark as the hours he works. *The Lazy Film Writers - A parody of various film genres. The writers are reluctant to carry out research for their next film, and consequently make films with generic storylines, oversimplified dialogue and glaring inaccuracies. Members of the crew on a spaceship are at one point warned that \\"breathing space is incredibly bad for you\\". *The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Caesar-Salad - Characters in Series 1 and 3. Sir Digby (Webb) and his sidekick Ginger (Mitchell) believe that they are detectives in the style of Dick Barton when in fact they are drunken tramps. They are so poor that they have to hum their own theme tune (Devil's Galop), which is usually sung as the intrepid duo are escaping from a crime scene, and regularly fight each other for loose change. They believe that plots are constantly being hatched against them by their \\"nemesis\\" described as \\"some bastard who is presumably responsible\\". Henchmen of their nemesis turn up in the shape of the police or whoever stumbles in front of them. When the series transferred to television, Sir Digby was renamed Sir Digby Chicken Caesar, and he kept this name for the third radio series. In series three, Sir Digby thought his nemesis had contaminated a water supply, which led him to investigate a brewery. *Jason, the New Presenter - A recurring character in Series 1, played by Webb. Jason originally appeared in a fly-on-the-wall documentary where he almost killed himself, and subsequently became the star of the show. As a result, he now presents a wide range of make-over shows. Jason tends to be rather insensitive, and concerned only with himself and his fame. As such, he tends to insult his guests. *Little Date - A series of sketches in Series 3. Webb plays a man who has a different job in every sketch, who encounters a woman (Colman) whom he verbally attacks, mocks and ridicules until she cries. When the woman is as crying, Webb then asks her out on a \\"little date,\\" to which the woman always agrees, in the hope of feeling better. *Stargate - A series of sketches in Series 4. Mitchell plays the manager of Brown's Orthopaedic Supplies, an office that just happens to have a Stargate among its office equipment which the staff keep abusing. *The Old Lady Job Justification Hearings - A series of sketches in Series 4. Set about 30 years into the future, these are recordings of meetings between people who have different jobs (such as cosmetic surgeon, wedding planner or comedy double-act) trying to justify what they do is a \\"proper\\" job (like a doctor, fireman or someone who runs a little shop) to a group of old women. In the final episode of the series, Mitchell and Webb themselves were the subjects of the hearings. *Christopher Hitchens Hour - A series of sketches in Series 4 which satirised Christopher Hitchens by giving him his own television show on the children's TV network Cbeebies. The show in question would involve Hitchens summarising various complex geopolitical issues as if they were children's fairy tales, and would usually end with the 101st Airborne Division launching a bombing raid on Hitchens's political opponents. *Pinocchio - A modern version of the fairy tale of the same name, in which the titular character routinely embarrasses his 'father' in social situations.  Reception  The Telegraph called it \\"simply brilliant\\". It also received positive reviews from The Guardian and Radio Times.

The district contains numerous low and mid- rise heritage buildings once home to the city's automobile dealerships, that today hosts many of the city's top bars and restaurants, retail shops, and urban residences alongside modern construction consisting mostly of residential housing and hotels. Automobile Alley is listed in the National Historic Register of neighborhoods. In 2017, Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City, the last auto dealership remaining in Automobile Alley, announced that it would vacate the present site and move to the suburb of Edmond during 2018. After the move, the Automobile Alley site will be converted to other uses. History The Automobile Alley Historic District was primarily developed as a commercial district just north of downtown Oklahoma City. During the 1920s Automobile Alley, A-Alley for short, was a popular auto row, home to more than 2/3rds of the city's car dealerships for several decades in the 1900s. Numerous national and international brands had showrooms in Automobile Alley and the district thrived as a commercial hub for the state until the decline of downtown Oklahoma City during the 1970s and 1980s. Remnants of the city's auto history still exist in Automobile Alley including urban show-palaces for Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City, Jaguar of Oklahoma City, and Volvo of Oklahoma City, and the Bob Moore Auto Group is located nearby in MidTown. Today, these luxury icons of the automobile industry coexist alongside numerous retail shoppes, restaurants and bars that have opened in the ground floors of the historic buildings, with office and residential conversions in upper floors. Broadway Avenue, with a right-of way of , had been shown on the 1889 Oklahoma City plat as the widest street in the city, though it extended only as far as Northwest Fourth Street at the time. Subsequent plats continued the same width. Local legend says that the street was designed to be wide enough to allow a full team of horses and wagons to turn around.\\"Automobile Alley By 1911.\\" Accessed August 12, 2017. Boundaries Automobile Alley has generally defined as the 20 square city block area north of the Oklahoma City CBD, centered along North Broadway Avenue between N. 13th Street to N 4th Street; where the city's prominent automobile retailers had lavish showrooms, regional headquarters, and maintenance facilities. Today's Automobile Alley has expanded to become a true neighborhood (48 square blocks), engulfing the former Triangle/Flatiron District towards the East; now the district boundaries extends roughly from Robinson Avenue to Interstate 235. Structures Nighttime view of North Broadway Avenue, Automobile Alley Historic Buildings in Automobile Alley are noted at night for their colorful Neon lighting and advertising displays, including numerous retail signage and building wraps along North Broadway Avenue. Redevelopment Since the decline of downtown Oklahoma City in the 1980s there have been successive waves of development that have taken place in Automobile Alley. During the mid-1990s, there was an effort to redevelop the district, with the idea to transform many of the automobile showrooms and storefronts of Alley into upscale residential lofts, galleries, and office space. The city implemented a new streets-cape to define the district and numerous smaller companies brought office workers into previously boarded-up historic buildings, bringing the district back to life. During the 2000s there was a push of retail development into the district that began with the relocation of the historic, upscale Colcord Oyster Bar from the renovated Colcord Building in the central business district to an Automobile Alley storefront. Additional destination restaurants soon followed included the opening of the Iguana Lounge Grill, Red PrimeSteak; Oklahoma City's premier Zagat-rated urban steak haunt, and the 2015 openings of the ultra-chic 'Broadway 10 Bar & Chop House' and 'Sidecar' Barley Wine Bar. Since 2010 retail shoppes have made the surge into the district where retailers are converting former automobile showrooms on the lower levels of buildings into retail boutiques including Rawhide, PlenTY Mercantile, The Factory, Perch'd Modern clothiers, and Broadway Wine Merchants. Additional developments are announced seemingly every week, further defining AAlley's position as Oklahoma City's upscale retail destination. Since 2013 the neighborhood has seen the addition of modern residential and hotel projects as Automobile Alley's Eastern border has expanded toward I-235. Major projects include numerous upper floor loft conversions of the historic building stock (mostly along Broadway and Robinson Avenues), and the 2016 opening of the Metropolitan apartment complex. Additional residential projects are currently under construction or have been announced where the influx of new residents to the area likely may redefine Automobile Alley as a complete urban neighborhood to live, work, and play. The last automobile dealership along Automobile Alley, Mercedes-Benz of Oklahoma City at 1225 North Broadway, plans to vacate its premises in 2018 and move to suburban Edmond. The new location will occupy half of a building that was constructed to house Volkswagen of Edmond in 2003. The existing Mercedes-Benz building on Broadway was originally constructed in 1985 by Frank Bolen, a car dealer who opened Benchmark Motors inside. Bolen later sold the business to Bob Howard, who turned it in to Mercedes-Benz of Oklahoma City.

He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, along with Donna Strickland, for the invention of chirped pulse amplification, a technique later used to create ultrashort- pulse, very high-intensity (petawatt) laser pulses. In 1994, Mourou and his team at the University of Michigan discovered that the balance between the self-focusing refraction (see Kerr effect) and self-attenuating diffraction by ionization and rarefaction of a laser beam of terawatt intensities in the atmosphere creates \\"filaments\\" which act as waveguides for the beam, thus preventing divergence. Career Mourou has been director of the Laboratoire d'optique appliqu√©e at the ENSTA from 2005 to 2009. He is a professor and member of Haut Coll√®ge at the √âcole polytechnique and A. D. Moore Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan where he has taught for over 16 years. He was the founding director of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan in 1990. He had previously led a research group on ultrafast sciences at Laboratoire d'optique appliqu√©e of ENSTA and √âcole polytechnique, after obtaining a PhD degree from Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1973. He then went to the United States and became a professor at the University of Rochester in 1977, where he and his then student Donna Strickland produced their Nobel prize- winning work in the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the university. The pair co-invented chirped pulse amplification, a \\"method of generating high- intensity, ultra-short optical pulses\\". Strickland's doctoral thesis was on \\"development of an ultra-bright laser and an application to multi-photon ionization\\". In the 2000s, Mourou was featured by a French film company in a publicity video for the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI). On 23 November 2015, he attended the Third Christmas Lecture held in Bucharest. His presentation was entitled Breaking Through The Unknown: Extreme light, Science to Art. The previous lectures were given by Sir Thomas Kibble and Joseph Silk. = Nobel Prize = Mourou, speaking in 2018 after being awarded the Nobel Prize On 2 October 2018, Mourou and Strickland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with for their joint work on chirped pulse amplification. They shared half of the Prize, while the other half was awarded to Arthur Ashkin for his invention of \\"optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers\\". G√©rard Mourou during Nobel press conference in Stockholm, December 2018 Mourou and Strickland found that stretching a laser out reduced its peak power, which could then be greatly amplified using normal instruments. It could then be compressed to create the short-lived, highly powerful lasers they were after. The technique, which was described in Strickland's first scientific publication, came to be known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). They were probably unaware at the time that their tools would make it possible to study natural phenomena in unprecedented ways. CPA could also per definition be used to create a laser pulse that only lasts one attosecond, one-billionth of a billionth of a second. At those timescales, it became possible not only to study chemical reactions, but what happens inside individual atoms. The Guardian and Scientific American provided simplified summaries of the work of Strickland and Mourou: it \\"paved the way for the shortest, most intense laser beams ever created\\". \\"The ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective\\" laser eye surgeries. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged the achievements of Mourou and Strickland: \\"Their innovative work can be found in applications including corrective eye surgery, and is expected to have a significant impact on cancer therapy and other physics research in the future\\".Statement by the Prime Minister on Donna Strickland winning the Nobel Prize in Physics 2 October 2018 PMO Awards and honors *1995 ‚Äì R.

Thus far there have been three 4-issue miniseries (also released as trade paperbacks), a one-shot, and an original graphic novel, all written by van Meter but each illustrated by a different set of artists, including Christine Norrie, Chynna Clugston, Andi Watson, Bryan Lee O'Malley, Vera Brosgol, and Meredith McClaren. The story follows the members of the Hopeless-Savage family. Parents Dirk Hopeless and Nikki Savage are old- school punks who were part of the 70's punk scene. They married and moved to the suburbs to raise their children. The three oldest, Rat Bastard, Arsenal Fierce, and Twitch Strummer, are grown and have moved out of the house; youngest daughter Skank Zero is in high school as the series begins. The thread running throughout the stories is a family which superficially doesn't fit the \\"norm\\" but which can still stand together and function better than most \\"normal\\" families. Characters =The Hopeless-Savage Family= The Hopeless-Savages live in a typical suburban neighborhood in the fictitious Flange City. Although all of the family's children were born and raised in the United States, they all make frequent use of the working-class British slang that they grew up with. *Dirk Hopeless ‚Äì The patriarch of the Hopeless-Savage clan. His real name is David Sterling, and before he found success as a punk rocker he was a teen idol in his native England, performing as part of Little Davie and the Sterlings. Feeling creatively stunted by his bubblegum-pop persona, he changed his name to Dirk Hopeless and became involved in the punk scene. He's the voice of reason in the Hopeless-Savage family, balancing out Nikki's sharp temper. He's also the primary cook for the family, often seen puttering around the kitchen in an apron. *Nikki Savage ‚Äì The matriarch of the Hopeless-Savage clan. Nikki grew up in Nebraska, helping out in her family's bakery. Wanting to escape small town life, she followed a boyfriend to the big city, where she found musical success and drug addiction. After completing rehab, her manager Weej introduced her to Dirk and they ended up touring together, eventually falling in love and getting married. Nikki is tough and scrappy, proving throughout the series that she can hold her own. She also has a violent temper and Dirk affectionately describes her as \\"a bit mad\\". *Rat Bastard Hopeless-Savage ‚Äì Rat's the eldest of the Hopeless-Savage children. At age fifteen he was rejected by a girl he was dating, prompting him to renounce his punk roots and move away from home. In the first miniseries he's working at Monjava (a company resembling Starbucks) at their corporate office, using his father's old name David Sterling. After the events of the first series he moves home and begins using his own name again. While growing up Rat took his older brother role seriously and his younger siblings looked up to him, particularly Zero. He is the only member of the family who is currently single. *Arsenal Fierce Hopeless-Savage ‚Äì The second-oldest, Arsenal runs a martial arts dojo and lives with her boyfriend Claude Shi, a fashion designer. As a child, Arsenal constantly got into fights and was expelled from so many schools that her parents eventually enrolled her in parochial school, which she actually enjoyed. Arsenal has played the role of protector ever since she was young; the reason for all those fights was her desire to protect weaker children from bullies. In college she became an activist, participating in such events as Take Back the Night. She's grown up to be fairly level-headed but still very protective, sometimes still acting rashly in extreme circumstances. Arsenal is an extremely skilled fighter and a top competitor in martial arts tournaments. She is an affectionate older sister to Zero, who she usually calls \\"Skankabelle\\". Whenever Arsenal goes on vacation she gets a new tattoo, likening it to getting a new stamp in her passport. *Twitch Strummer Hopeless-Savage ‚Äì The third-oldest, Twitch works as an artist and theatrical set designer. He dates Claude's younger brother Henry Shi, whom he dated in high school before breaking up to go to college. Unlike the rest of his family, Twitch identifies more with mod culture rather than punk. He sometimes exhibits hyper-active tendencies which some theorize is the result of controlled substances (he jokes about being on crack early in the first issue) and sometimes will work all night on a project without sleep. *Skank Zero Hopeless-Savage ‚Äì The youngest sibling and main protagonist of the series; most of the stories unfold around Zero. As a high school (and later college) student, she's the only member of the family who's still in school. Zero fronts a band called the Dusted Bunnies and studies filmmaking as a \\"backup plan\\". She dates Ginger Kincaid, the class genius. Scrappy and outspoken, Zero reminds Nikki of a younger version of herself and as a result gets into several arguments with her mother, who tends to be overprotective of her. Since she was a young child, Zero has used a variety of unique words and phrases which sound similar to Cockney slang, but which she herself invented. This is often a source of confusion to her teachers and other people outside her circle of family and friends. =Other characters= *Norwegian \\"Weej\\" Blue ‚Äì Nikki and Dirk's former manager, who originally introduced the two at his birthday party right after picking Nikki up from rehab. Dirk eventually fired Weej, saying that he'd trust him with his life but not his money. Weej is named after the fictional species of parrot in the Dead Parrot sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus. *Ginger Kincaid ‚Äì Zero's boyfriend. A genius, MIT personally invited him to tour their campus and interview for admission. He originally met Zero when she and her siblings helped him stand up against bullies as a child. The two eventually left to attend different colleges, leading to emotional strain as they work to maintain their long-distance relationship. *Claude Shi ‚Äì Arsenal's live-in boyfriend who works as a fashion designer. The two met while still in school at a martial arts tournament. *Henry Shi ‚Äì Claude's younger brother, a musician and Twitch's boyfriend. Twitch originally broke up with him when Henry was admitted to Juilliard, afraid of holding him back. In the second miniseries, Hopeless Savages: Ground Zero, they reunite. *The Dusted Bunnies ‚Äì The punk-influenced alternative rock band Zero fronts as lead singer, guitarist and songwriter. The other members are Emma (guitar), Toby (bass) and Flora (drums). Emma and Toby are dating. Flora has a more brash and assertive personality. The band's origins and how they all met is the topic of the one-shot Hopeless Savages B-Sides: The Origin of the Dusted Bunnies. *Tiffany Brenner ‚Äì Tiffany dated Rat when they were teenagers, but cruelly rejected him when his parents would not help her further her musical ambitions. She was later found working as a personal assistant for Norwegian Blue and was assaulted by Zero, who blamed her for Rat's leaving the family. Later, as a way of making amends, Tiffany offered to use her contacts and knowledge of the music industry as manager of the Dusted Bunnies. *Undertow ‚Äì A popular and successful punk rock band formed by Dirk Hopeless in the 1970s. In addition to Dirk the band consisted of bassist Norman \\"Stink\\" Kearne (known as \\"Uncle Stinky\\" to the Hopeless-Savage children) and drummer Owen Keyhole. Nikki later joined as co-lead singer. Undertow was popular enough to warrant television documentaries and compilation albums decades later, and Dirk and Nikki received Grammy Awards at some point. Publications =Stories= * Hopeless Savages ‚Äì Art by Christine Norrie with flashbacks illustrated by Chynna Clugston-Major. The first miniseries deals with Dirk and Nikki being kidnapped and their children trying to find them. They suspect it has something to do with their parents' past; so Arsenal, Twitch, and Zero first track down their older brother Rat, who they believe would know more about the situation but who left the family ten years earlier. Zero is at first reluctant to find him, feeling betrayed when he left. They finally locate him using their father's real name as a pseudonym and working at a trendy coffee company's corporate office. After attempting to de-program him they unravel the mystery of their parents' abduction, which stems back to copyright issues and Dirk's embarrassing past as a teen idol. * Hopeless Savages: Ground Zero ‚Äì Art by Bryan Lee O'Malley with segments illustrated by Andi Watson, Christine Norrie, Chynna Clugston- Major and Terry Dodson. The second miniseries covers the beginning of Zero and Ginger's relationship. Throughout the course of the story Zero keeps getting grounded by Nikki for various offenses like punching a boy who made a crass comment regarding her name and coming home late from band practice. While all this is going on, Antique Rock Television is filming a Behind the Music-type show about Dirk and Nikki, and Nikki is trying to remaster her old albums for a re-release. This is also the series in which Twitch and Henry get back together. * Too Much Hopeless Savages! ‚Äì Art by Christine Norrie and Ross (now Sophie) Campbell. The third miniseries centers mostly around Arsenal and Twitch's trip to Hong Kong, although the scenes which take place at home are still documented from Zero's point of view. Arsenal is entered in a martial arts tournament; Henry and Claude want to visit their Grandmother Shi, who is a renowned fortune teller. Arsenal is particularly anxious about the match since she will be fighting a man who she fought as an adolescent; he sucker punched her and she ended up in the hospital, the only major injury from all her many brawls. However, within minutes of arriving someone slips a much coveted item into Arsenal's bag at the airport, and before long they are being hunted by local criminals and the British Secret Service. Back in the States, the Hopeless-Savage family is being harassed by a conservative Christian group led by a charismatic preacher who is manipulating Nikki's mother Vera. Fed up with the picketers on their lawn, the family decides to join Arsenal and Twitch in Hong Kong, taking Grandma Savage along with them. * Hopeless Savages: B-sides: The Origin of the Dusted Bunnies ‚Äì Art by Becky Cloonan, Vera Brosgol, and Mike Norton. A one-shot (March 2005) that tells the story of how Zero formed her band. Separate vignettes show how she met each member, starting with Flora in junior high and working backwards to Emma in elementary school and Toby as a toddler. * Hopeless Savages: Break ‚Äì Art by Meredith McClaren with flashbacks by Christine Norrie. The first Hopeless-Savages story published originally as a graphic novel rather than a series of individual comics issues. Zero is now attending college, and is having trouble dealing with the pressure and her difficult roommate. She decides to spend Spring Break touring with the Dusted Bunnies, but they find that a rival band is trying to sabotage their tour for unknown reasons. Dirk is called to the bedside of a dying friend and former bandmate. Nikki is injured while on a solo tour, and calls upon Rat to make sure the hospital does not give her narcotics which may cause her to relapse into drug dependency. Arsenal and Claude are struggling with their newborn twins, and trying to decide what to name them. Twitch and Henry are miserable while on tour with a travelling ice show, and try extraordinary means to get out of their contract. =Short stories= * \\"Sticks and Stones\\" - Art by Chynna Clugston-Major.

Intended for a military career, he frequents many musicians in the Parisian salons, which has decided his vocation.

If he forges an international reputation, he remains nevertheless less known in the lyrical field than Andr√© Gr√©try. His first compositions were violin duos, string trios and quartets. He published them under a pseudonym with Italian consonance. The quartets were very successful, and the true identity of their author was eventually discovered. According to Ren√©-Charles Guilbert de Pix√©r√©court, initiated in Freemasonry he was a member of the Masonic lodge of ¬´The Nine Sisters¬ª and composed in 1778 the music for the reception of Voltaire and of the party in honor of Benjamin Franklin at the home of Anne- Catherine de Ligniville Helv√©tius.

It was first released by Simulations Publications, Inc. in 1980. Each player in EOMA controls an empire composed of areas, each of which is rated for wealth, religion, language and population. The talents of each empire's current ruler are represented by numerical ratings for warfare, administration, and diplomacy. The object of the game is essentially to grow an empire in terms of wealth, geography and stability. Development Empires of the Middle Ages was designed by James Dunnigan, a prolific game designer and writer. However, often a Dunnigan design would consist of no more than a four-page outline on a legal pad and a developer would then take over, doing a strong majority of the work and completing the project. In this case, this was done by Anthony F. Buccini who also received a designer's credit. A third design credit went to Redmond A. Simonsen, who was responsible for all the graphical features of the game and likely played a significant role in development as well. Game play The game is played in turns representing five years, and each player may attempt one endeavor for each year. Endeavors may be diplomatic, economic (such as taxation) or military in nature. Central to the game are two decks of cards, Event and Year cards. Event cards create random events such as plague, famine or schism, while Year cards are used to resolve endeavors. A key element is the ever-present possibility of civil unrest and other military and political threats. The full campaign game begins in the year 770 (the accession of Charlemagne) and continues to about 1475. Smaller scenarios begin with the historical situation in a particular year and cover a century or two. Assessment At the time of release, the game was unusual in that it did not use army counters to represent military assets in the game. Instead, military action was carried out as an endeavor, an abstract action, with success depending mainly on the military skill of the ruler and the relative strengths of the target area and the area from which the attack was launched. The game quickly achieved cult status after it went out of print when SPI folded and was bought by TSR. A DOS computer version of the board game was released around 1990 under the name Rise of the West. TSR and its subsequent owners have sold the rights to a number of games to other publishers; Decision Games bought the rights to Empires of the Middle Ages, and updated and re-released the game in 2004. Decision Games reprinted the game in 2014. Reception Empires of the Middle Ages was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for \\"Best Pre-20th Century Game of 1980\\". Timothy Brown comments: \\"The game stands out for its innovative balance of mechanics and graphics, guaranteeing an enjoyable session every time.\\" The game was evidently popular enough for SPI to release a follow-on game called The Sword and the Stars that employed a modified version of the same systems, setting the theme in an outer space future.

It \\"generated a storm of criticism in the years following its release\\". In the years immediately after its release, WASH-1400 was followed by a number of reports that either peer reviewed its methodology or offered their own judgments about probabilities and consequences of various events at commercial reactors. In at least a few instances, some offered critiques of the study's assumptions, methodology, calculations, peer review procedures, and objectivity.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 147. A succession of reports, including NUREG-1150, the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses and others, have carried-on the tradition of PRA and its application to commercial power plants. The report correctly foresaw the impact a tsunami could have on a nuclear power station. It concluded that \\"Some plants are located on the sea shore where the possibility of tsunami, and waves and high water levels due to hurricanes exist. The plant design in these cases must accommodate the largest waves and water levels that can be expected. Such events were assessed to represent negligible risks.\\" (Section 5.4.6 \\"Other external causes\\") Overview Individual Risk of Early Fatality by Various Causes, Table 6-3, WASH-1400 pg. 112 WASH-1400 considered the course of events that might arise during a serious accident at a (then) large modern Light water reactor. It estimated the radiological consequences of these events, and the probability of their occurrence, using a fault tree/event tree approach. This technique is called Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA). The report concluded that the risks to the individual posed by nuclear power stations were acceptably small, compared with other tolerable risks. Specifically, the report concluded, using the methods and resources and knowledge available at the time, that the probability of a complete core meltdown is about 1 in 20,000 per reactor per year. The study was peer-reviewed by the 'Lewis Committee' in 1977, which broadly endorsed the methodology as the best available, but cautioned that the risk figures were subject to large uncertainty. The methods used were comparatively simple by today's standards and based on early understanding of key phenomenology. Amidst a period of intensive (and extensive) research and discussion, inspired in part by the Three Mile Island accident, work continued on PRA including NUREG-1150 and an ongoing study being performed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA). Specific Studies were also made of two plants at Zion and Indian Point‚Äîthe so-called Z/IP Study. The PRA methodology became generally followed as part of the safety-assessment of all modern nuclear power plants. In the 1990s, all U.S. nuclear power plants submitted PRAs to the NRC under the Individual Plant Examination program , and five of these were the basis for the 1991 NUREG-1150. According to Table 6-3 on pg. 112 of WASH-1400, individual persons have a less than 1 in 5,000,000,000 (Tbl 6-3, pg. 112) chance of dying on a yearly basis from the operation of 100 nuclear power plants in the United States. This is less than yearly risk of being struck by lightning and being killed (1 in 20,000,000, Tbl 6-3, pg. 112), being in a fatal auto collision (1 in 3,000 chance of dying, Tbl 6-3, pg. 112), or any other accident risk mentioned in WASH-1400. WASH-1400 is now NUREG-75/014. Criticism and debate In the years since its publication, WASH-1400 has occasioned much discussion of its methods and has seen the rise of competing judgments about the probabilities and consequences of adverse events in commercial nuclear power reactors. A panel of scientists organized by the American Physical Society (APS) \\"found much to criticize\\" in the WASH-1400 report. The panel noted that fatality estimates had considered only deaths during the first 24 hours after an accident, although other pathways (e.g., via radioactive cesium) could result in environmental exposures after the acute phase of an accident and could expose large populations to adverse effects, albeit at small doses. Any cancers that might arise might not show up until years after the accident. The APS reviewers also criticized the report‚Äôs methods for predicting the performance of emergency cooling systems.Office of Technology Assessment. (1984). Nuclear power in an Age of Uncertainty. Chapter 8 Public Attitudes Toward Nuclear Power, pp. 218‚Äì219. One particular focus of discussion has been the size of the probabilities, posited in WASH-1400, of the occurrence of the various accidents and events. While a 1982 report by Science Applications Inc. (SAI) found those of WASH-1400 to be underestimates, a contemporaneous report by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators found SAI's to be too high by a factor of 30.Office of Technology Assessment. (1984). Nuclear power in an Age of Uncertainty. Chapter 8 Public Attitudes Toward Nuclear Power, pp. 218‚Äì219 The Union of Concerned Scientists released a 150-page report critiquing the WASH-1400 report, and in June 1976, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment held hearings on the validity of the report's findings. As a result of these hearings, NRC agreed to have a review group examine the validity of the report's conclusions. In a 1978 report,Harold Lewis (1978).Risk Assessment Review Group Report to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC]. the review group appointed by the NRC and led by Professor Harold Lewis of the University of California concluded that \\"the uncertainties in WASH-1400's estimates of the probabilities of severe accidents were in general, greatly understated\\".Stephanie Cooke (2009). In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age, Black Inc., p. 288. Rassmussen observed that the likelihood of a core melt, as estimated in WASH-1400 and NUREG 1150, were in close agreement and their uncertainty bands overlapped.Norman Rassmussen. Letter to Steve Griffith, President's Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear Accidents In 1979, The NRC issued a policy statement in which it accepted numerous criticisms of WASH-1400 raised by the Lewis Report, and it withdrew any endorsement of the executive summary.John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 148.

One of the first vegan cookbooks, Ten Talents (1968), was written by a church member, Rosalie Hurd. The title refers to a quote from Ellen White, \\"The one who understands the art of properly preparing food, and who uses this knowledge, is worthy of higher commendation than those engaged in any other line of work. This talent should be regarded as equal in value to ten talents\\".  Media Ministries  Adventists have long been proponents of media-based ministries. Traditional Adventist evangelistic efforts consisted of street missions and the distribution of tracts such as The Present Truth, which was published by James White as early as 1849. Until J. N. Andrews was sent to Switzerland in 1874, Adventist global efforts consisted entirely of the posting of tracts such as White's writings to various locations. In the last century, these media based efforts have also made use of emerging media such as radio and television. The first of these was H. M. S. Richards' radio show The Voice of Prophecy, which was initially broadcast in Los Angeles in 1929. Since then Adventists have been on the forefront of media evangelism, and one program, It Is Written, founded by George Vandeman, was the first religious program to air on colour television and was the first major Christian ministry to utilize satellite uplink technology. The Three Angels Broadcasting Network was founded in 1984 by Danny Shelton. Troubled by what he saw on Christian television, Shelton was inspired to \\"build the television and radio networks that would reach the world with the undiluted three angels' messages of Revelation 14 - the networks that would counteract the counterfeit.\\" Eventually, this would develop into a major 24-hour satellite service seen around the world, consisting of 3ABN (English) television network, 3ABN Radio Network, and 3ABN Latino (Spanish) Network. 3ABN (as it is often called) broadcasts programming from all the major Seventh-day Adventist ministries, as well as its own productions covering religious, health, children, and music programming. This organization is a privately run non-profit organization, and is a supporting ministry (not an official part) of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. * 3ABN * Amazing Facts * It Is Written * Voice of Prophecy See also * Country Life Restaurants * Seventh-day Adventist interfaith relations * Seventh-day Adventist Church * History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church * 28 fundamental beliefs * Questions on Doctrine * Biblical Research Institute * Teachings of Ellen White * Seventh-day Adventist eschatology  References  See also Issues: The Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain Private Ministries, published in 1992 by the North American Division.

At first Fat Possum focused almost entirely on recording previously unknown Mississippi blues artists (typically from Oxford or Holly Springs, Mississippi). Recently, Fat Possum has signed younger rock acts to its roster. The label has been featured in The New York Times, New Yorker,McInerney, Jay. \\"White Man at the Door: One Man's Mission to Record the 'Dirty Blues' - before Everyone Dies.\\" The New Yorker (February 4, 2002): page 55 The Observer, a Sundance Channel production, features on NPR,\\"R.L.

Fat Possum also distributes the Hi Records catalog. History Fat Possum was founded in 1991 by Living Blues editor Peter Redvers-Lee, who went to the University of Mississippi for his MA studies in Journalism. He planned on starting a record label and picked the name with another student, Billy \\"Pup\\" Cochrane. Co-founder Matthew Johnson, who grew up in the state, was also a student at the University of Mississippi. By 1994 or so Lee left, and freelance recording engineer Bruce Watson assumed his managerial role. An early investor was John Hermann of Widespread Panic, who also pitched Robert Palmer's name as producer. The label initially specialised in discovering blues players from the North Mississippi region, many of whom had never recorded before. At Fat Possum's behest some artists, particularly R. L. Burnside, released both standard blues albums and more techno albums, done in the style that would later be made famous by Moby's album Play. This led to a fair amount of controversy among blues purists, a group in which Johnson was largely uninterested.The liner notes for Not the Same Old Blues Crap 3 and several other blues compilations contain essays by Matthew Johnson regarding his feelings for blues archivalists. He is against them. Many of the early artists for Fat Possum were picked with the aid of Palmer (previously a teacher of Johnson at the University of Mississippi), who also produced a number of records for the label. Although their releases were critically acclaimed, particularly Junior Kimbrough's album All Night Long, which received 4 stars from Rolling Stone and the loud approval of Iggy Pop, In 1995 they added Arkansas bluesman John \\"So Blue\\" Weston to their roster, with So Doggone Blue (FP 1003) produced by Living Blues writer Larry Hoffman. Disputes between the artist and label resulted in Hoffman buying back the master and selling it to Evidence Records (UPC: 730182609226) Junior Kimbrough performed one of his few tours with Iggy Pop. Fat Possum was perennially strapped for cash. Word of mouth and artist compilations, such as Not the Same Old Blues Crap 3 (with a cover illustration by Joe Sacco)Sacco also travelled with T-Model Ford for a piece for Vanity Fair and All Men Are Liars, gradually pulled Fat Possum out of the red, even if only for brief periods of time. A legal fight with Capricorn Records, who were to be their distributor, drained Fat Possum's funds and left a number of projects on the shelf. Burnside proved early on to be the label's biggest money maker. Having released two albums, he teamed with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for a tour, and then recorded with the band A Ass Pocket of Whiskey, which helped Burnside and Fat Possum gain wider recognition. A remix of the R. L. Burnside song, \\"It's Bad You Know\\", was also featured prominently on The Sopranos. With time, many of the label's artists have died. Asie Payton, King Ernest, and Charles Caldwell died before their records could be released. Kimbrough died in 1998 and Burnside 2005. T-Model Ford and Robert Belfour joined in the 2010s. Responding to the first deaths, Fat Possum begun to release more archival records.Previously, the only non-Fat Possum recorded album released was by Scott Dunbar George Mitchell's recordings came out first as individual albums of Furry Lewis, Mississippi Joe Callicott, R.L. Burnside, Townes Van Zandt, and others, with covers designed by Chip Kidd, and then in bulk as the George Mitchell Collection. They acquired the Al Green catalog including his 1975 Greatest Hits. The successful band The Black Keys released their second album Thickfreakness (2003) on Fat Possum, and left the label after their third album Rubber Factory (2004). Solomon Burke's \\"comeback\\" album, Don't Give Up On Me, won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. In 2013, Fat Possum released Ready To Die by Iggy and the Stooges. Concluding that further searches for rural talent are hopeless, it has begun to broaden its base of artists and sign a range of younger, indie rock bands like Andrew Bird, Milk Music, MellowHype, the Heartless Bastards, Deadboy & the Elephantmen, Wavves, Youth Lagoon, The Walkmen, Temples, Yuck, Fat White Family, The Districts, Crocodiles, Bass Drum of Death, and Soccer Mommy. They have tapped into the indie-folk scene, releasing Verbena's frontman A.A. Bondy's solo records, The Felice Brothers, and female songwriter Lissie. In 2017 Fat Possum partnered with founding Gorilla vs. Bear blogger Chris Cantalini to start new label Luminelle Recordings. Canadian singer-songwriter Helena Deland was the label's first signing.

(25 MW) Modification of the NK-36ST gas turbine. *NK-38ST. (16 MW) Derivative of the NK-93 propfan. Development tests conducted in 1995. Serial production started in 1998. =Rocket engines= In 1959, Sergey Korolev ordered a new design of rocket engine from the Kuznetzov Bureau for the Global Rocket 1 (GR-1) Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which was developed but never deployed. The result was the NK-9, one of the first staged-combustion cycle rocket engines. The design was developed by Kuznetsov into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines in the 1960s, and claimed them to be the highest-performance rocket engines ever built, which were to propel the N1 lunar rocket‚Äîone that was never successfully launched.Lindroos, Marcus. THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM MIT. Accessed: 4 October 2011. As of 2011, the aging NK-33 remains the most efficient (in terms of thrust-to-mass ratio) LOX/Kerosene rocket engine ever created. The Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift launcher has two modified NK-33 in its first stage, a solid second stage and a hypergolic orbit stage. The NK-33s are first imported from Russia to the United States and then modified into Aerojet AJ26s, which involves removing some harnessing, adding U.S. electronics, qualifying it for U.S. propellants, and modifying the steering system. The Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013. This marked the first successful launch of the NK-33 heritage engines built in early 1970s. Kuznetsov rocket engines include: *Kuznetsov oxygen-rich stage-combustion RP1/LOX rocket engine family. Including NK-9, NK-15, NK-19, NK-21, NK-33, NK-39, NK-43. The original version was designed to power an ICBM. In the 1970s some improved versions were built for the ill-fated Soviet Lunar mission. More than 150 NK-33 engines were produced and stored in a warehouse ever since, with 36 engines having been sold to Aerojet general in the 1990s. Two NK-33 derived engines (Aerojet AJ-26) are used in the first stage of the Antares rocket developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation. The Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013. This marked the first successful launch of the NK-33 heritage engines built in the early 1970s. TsSKB-Progress also uses the stockpile NK-33 as the first-stage engine of the lightweight version of the Soyuz rocket family, the Soyuz-2-1v. *RD-107A rocket engine. Powers the boosters of the R-7 family including the Soyuz-FG and Soyuz-2. *RD-108A rocket engine. Powers the core stage of the R-7 family including the Soyuz-FG and Soyuz-2.

The poem is the fifth in a series of poems entitled 1914. It was published in 1915 in the book, 1914 and Other Poems. It is often contrasted with Wilfred Owen's 1917 antiwar poem Dulce et Decorum est. The manuscript is located at King's College, Cambridge. Structure of the poem Written with fourteen lines in a Petrarchan/Italian sonnet form, the poem is divided into an opening octet, and then followed by a concluding sestet. As far as rhyme scheme, the octet is rhymed after the Shakespearean/Elizabethan (ABAB CDCD) form, while the sestet follows the Petrarchan/Italian (EFG EFG) form. The volta, the shift or point of dramatic change, occurs after the fourth line where Brooke goes from describing the death of the soldier, to his life accomplishments winning of the First World War in 1914, as part of a series of sonnets written by Rupert Brooke. Brooke himself, predominantly a prewar poet, died the year before \\"The Soldier\\" was published. \\"The Soldier\\", being the conclusion and the finale to Brooke‚Äôs 1914 war sonnet series, deals with the death and accomplishments of a soldier. This sonnet encompasses the memoirs of a deceased soldier who declares his patriotism to his homeland by declaring that his sacrifice will be the eternal ownership of England of the small portion of land where his body is buried. The poem appears to not follow the normal purpose of a Petrarchan/Italian sonnet either. It does not truly go into detail about a predicament/resolution, as is customary with this form; rather, the atmosphere remains constantly in the blissful state of the English soldier.  Cultural influence  The poem is read aloud twice in the 1969 film, Oh! What a Lovely War. The first time, the poem is read in its entirety by a soldier writing it in the trenches. The second time, a different soldier reads from a paper that 70% casualties occurred at the last battle, and recites the beginning lines, \\"That there's some corner of a foreign field that is for ever England.\\" Lyrics in Roger Waters' ‚ÄúThe Gunner's Dream‚Äù (from the Pink Floyd album The Final Cut) make reference to ‚ÄúThe Soldier‚Äù. Implicit references to this poem (and several others) are made in Muse's song ‚ÄúSoldier's Poem‚Äù from their album Black Holes & Revelations. Prior to the first moon landing in 1969, William Safire prepared a speech for U.S. President Richard Nixon to give in case of disaster. The last line of the prepared address intentionally echoes a similar line from the poem. (\\"For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.\\") This line is in reference to the first few lines of the poem. The Second World War fiction novel Under an English Heaven, by Robert Radcliffe, tells the story of a Flying Fortress bomber crew in the USAAF 520th Bombardment Group, based on a Suffolk airbase. The novel takes its title directly from this piece, and although not mentioning the poem directly, comparisons are drawn between \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" and particular bombing missions over occupied Europe which elicited a very high casualty rate, underlining the futility of the survival odds for any given bomber crew. English singer songwriter Al Stewart makes reference to Brooke in his song \\"Somewhere in England (1915)\\" from the album A Beach Full of Shells: ‚ÄúAnd the maker of rhymes on the deck who is going to die, in the corner of some foreign field that will make him so famous, as the light temporarily shines to illumine his pages.‚Äù The poem is used as the theme for The Listener Crossword 4343, \\"Bear, Bear Bearing\\". The title hints at \\"Rupert Brook-e\\", and features from the poem are hidden in the grid. In the Blackadder Goes Forth episode \\"Major Star\\", Captain Blackadder says \\"If I should die, think only this of me, I'll be back to get you.\\" In the film All the King's Men the poem is twice quoted verbatim: once early in the story as the inexperienced soldiers boast of coming glorious death in battle and again near the end at the funeral of a soldier killed in Gallipoli. The contrast in these two recitations (in tone, character, setting, purpose) illustrates the nuance of the poem beyond any patriotism/anti-war dichotomy.

Life Tommy Trinder was born at 54 Wellfield Road, Streatham, South London (a plaque from the Streatham Society marks the spot), on 24 March 1909, the son of Thomas Henry Trinder, a London tram driver from Shilton, Oxfordshire, and his wife Jennie Georgina Harriet Mills. He left school early for a job as an errand boy, but by the age of 12, was on stage. He toured South Africa with a revue company in 1921 and appeared as a boy vocalist at Collins' Music Hall the following year. Minor successes in music hall, revues and working men's clubs followed. By 1926, aged 17, Trinder was the star of Archie Pitt's travelling variety comedy shows. National recognition began to come in 1937 with the revues Tune In and In Town Tonight. By the time of the Second World War he was one of Britain's foremost entertainers (a position he would maintain until the 1960s) and his shows brought welcome relief during the darkest days of the war. Trinder with Jean Colin during the making of Communal Kitchen: Eating Out With Tommy Trinder for the Ministry of Information in 1941 Ealing Studios signed him up to films during the war. His most famous was the comedy Sailors Three in which he, Claude Hulbert and Michael Wilding capture a German pocket battleship. He also took straight acting parts in The Foreman Went to France, The Bells Go Down (a tribute to the work done by firemen in London during the Blitz); and Bitter Springs about a family fighting to make a new life in the Australian Outback. He is believed to have originated \\"Trinder's Impossibility\\" ‚Äì a \\"bar bet\\" where the mark is presented with a ten shilling note, partly torn through in two places at right angles to the long side and challenged to hold the two corners of the torn edge and tear it into three pieces. It cannot be done. After the war, as a national figure he was soon recruited to television. From 1955 to 1958, he was the original compere for ITV television programme Sunday Night at the London Palladium. \\"He would begin his act with, 'The name's Trinder. That's T-R-I-N-D-E-R, pronounced Chumley.' This witticism was a gentle dig at the snobs of society, who insisted on pronouncing ordinary names in a fancy way which was utterly un-phonetic.\\" He lived in an Art Deco-style apartment block ‚Äì Du Cane Court, in Balham, south-west London ‚Äì the largest such under one roof in Europe in the 1930s. He moved in with Violet Trinder (n√©e Bailey; they had married in 1932) in 1939, and was still there in 1955. A neighbour described an impromptu encounter she had with him in which her silk scarf had covered her features. He said: \\"One should never hide a pretty face.\\" His second marriage was to Gwyn (Toni) Lancelyn Green. He moved to a large private estate, Burwood Park in Hersham, Surrey, calling the house \\"Tiverly\\". He is buried in Burvale Cemetery, which is close by to where he lived. He hosted his own television series, Trinder Box on the BBC in 1959. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in May 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. He was a lifelong devoted supporter of Fulham Football Club and was chairman of the club between 1959 and 1976. He was a proud and active member of the exclusive entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats, serving two non-consecutive terms as its \\"King Rat\\" in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He was also President of the Lord's Taverners cricketing charity in 1956. In 1979 he appeared in an edition of The Old Boy Network, doing his stand-up routine and presenting a condensed history of his life and career. Using a wheelchair after a stroke in 1986, he made his final television appearance in I Like The Girls Who Do recalling his contemporary Max Miller. Always a favourite with the Royal family (he made six appearances in Royal Variety Performances between 1945 and 1980), he was appointed a CBE in 1975. He died on 10 July 1989.

Its objective was to enable corporate raiders to launch leveraged buyout (LBO) offers without the debt component of their financing package fully in place. The letter was first crafted in 1983 for use in Carl Icahn's attempt to take ownership of Phillips 66. The conventional wisdom was that due to Icahn's reputation as a takeover artist combined with the junk bond's perception as below investment grade paper, no bank would want to commit the cash necessary to augment any bonds Drexel would raise. Leon Black, Drexel's lead investment banker on the deal, proposed that Drexel write a letter advising the banks that it was \\"highly confident\\" that it would be able to raise the required debt in time to fulfill Icahn's obligations. A large portion of the debt financing would be composed of junk bonds raised by Milken. In essence, Drexel, as principal underwriter of the debt, would not actually raise the money, but promised that it could. The highly confident letter had no legal status. Nonetheless, Drexel, or more precisely, Milken, had a reputation for being able to make markets for any bonds it sold. Thus, its ability to raise the huge amounts of leverage that were required for LBOs was widely accepted as given in the markets during those days. Drexel's senior management saw this as a win-win situation for the firm. If it worked, it would be a valuable tool in future deals; if it didn't, Drexel wouldn't suffer any significant losses. As it turned out, Icahn did not actually win control of Phillips, but made enough of a profit that the deal was considered an unqualified success for Drexel. The highly confident letter was used on several more occasions over the years, and given Drexel's reputation it was considered as good as cash for corporate raiders in the 1980s.

He was born in Dronfield, Derbyshire. Methods Hendy-Freegard met his victims on social occasions or as customers in the pub or car dealership where he was working. He would reveal his \\"role\\" as an undercover agent for MI5, Special Branch or Scotland Yard working against the IRA. He would win them over, ask for money and make them do his bidding. He demanded that they cut off contact with family and friends, go through \\"loyalty tests\\" and live alone in poor conditions. He seduced five women, claiming that he wanted to marry them. Initially some of the victims refused to cooperate with the police because he had warned them that police would be double agents or MI5 agents performing another \\"loyalty test\\". A television documentary called \\"The Spy who stole my Life\\" was shown by Channel Five on 7 September 2005. In Australia, this was called \\"The spy who conned me\\". First victims In 1992 Robert Freegard was working in The Swan, a pub in Newport, Shropshire and befriended two women and one man, three agriculture students of the Harper Adams Agricultural College in Edgmond. First, he told the man that he was an MI5 undercover agent who was investigating an IRA cell in the college. He forced the man to let himself be beaten up to prove his loyalty and to show that he was \\"hard enough\\". He also convinced him to behave in a bizarre manner in college to prove his loyalty and to alienate him from friends. Then Hendy-Freegard told him his cover was blown and both of them had to go undercover. He told the women that the man had cancer and convinced them to accompany them in a \\"farewell tour\\" all over England. Later he let them in on \\"the story\\". He told them to sever all contact with their families because they were in danger just through being associated with him. They moved to Sheffield and gave him all their money. The three spent five months in a Sheffield flat because Hendy-Freegard had forbidden them to go out. The group eventually split up, others took jobs ‚Äì still handing most of their money to Hendy-Freegard ‚Äì and one of the women became his lover. She gave birth to his two daughters. When she eventually found out about his other affairs and confronted him, he beat her up and threatened to kill her before he told her that she could not talk to anyone for \\"security reasons\\". Hendy-Freegard convinced the man and his parents to give him ¬£300,000. He was put into \\"training\\", performing spurious jobs. Sometimes he would have to wait for days in a certain place for a non-existent meeting. Eventually, he told his sister that the IRA was pursuing him, and the tale began to unravel. Other seductions Hendy-Freegard had an on/off affair with a recently married PA Elisabeth Bartholomew n√©e Richardson. She became obsessed with Hendy-Freegard and testified at trial \\"that she would have gone anywhere to be with Robert as he was great in bed\\". Richardson is one of two daughters originally from the Kiveton Park district of Sheffield. She was estranged from her Mother prior to meeting Hendy- Freegard and her Father is of Polish descent. Richardson also testified that Hendy-Freegard never actually told her he was undercover or MI5 though she believed he was through what other people had told her. Richardson told her closest friend Karen Adams that she wanted to follow Hendy-Freegard to London in a bid to start a new life with him. He told her to take up loans, supposedly to settle her debts following her divorce. Richardson returned to Sheffield and now lives in the Walkley district with her children under a new identity. She is said to have rebuilt her life and moved on from Hendy-Freegard. In 2000 Hendy- Freegard met a lawyer, a customer in the car dealership in Chiswick, West London. He helped her to change her car, pocketed the difference, asked for more, persuaded her to give more money for a leasing business they would run together and stole ¬£14,000 from her building society account. They became lovers and went on holidays all over the world. They then became engaged but her family intervened. When the leasing car did not materialize, he told her that the Polish Mafia had taken it. In 2002 Hendy-Freegard seduced an American child psychologist with tales of how he had infiltrated a criminal network and how he had killed a criminal who had threatened to expose him. He said he wanted to marry her, on condition that she would also become an agent and cut off the contact with her family. He instigated loyalty tests and a change of identity. Other victims Hendy-Freegard convinced a Sheffield jeweller to give the mother of his children a room for a time and later tried to recruit him into the \\"organization\\". Hendy-Freegard also sent him to perform spurious missions as \\"training\\" - like sending him to London with strict instructions of what transportation to use, to buy a can opener in a certain shop and hand it over to a certain man in a certain pub. When the victim's \\"controller\\" seemed excessively amused when told about his trip, he grew suspicious and demanded to see his boss. There was no one in the meeting. Hendy-Freegard convinced a female company director that he was watching someone in the Sheffield car dealership where he was working and convinced her to buy a better car. He sold her original car on his own account, kept the money and convinced her to take a ¬£15,000 loan for him. He also again asked for a room for the mother of his children because she was supposedly in a witness protection program and told her that she was Spanish, so that the two women would not speak to each other. Hendy-Freegard told a woman in Newcastle that he needed money to buy off IRA killers, who had been released after the Good Friday agreement. She gave him ¬£16,000 over six years. He also sold her car and again kept the money. Arrest and trial In 2002 Scotland Yard and the FBI organized a sting operation. First, the FBI bugged the phone of the American psychologist's parents. Her mother told Hendy-Freegard she would hand over ¬£10,000 but only in person. Hendy-Freegard met the mother in Heathrow airport where police apprehended him. He denied all charges and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against him and continued this story in the subsequent trial. On 23 June 2005, after an eight-month trial, Blackfriars Crown Court convicted Robert Hendy-Freegard for two counts of kidnapping, 10 of theft and 8 of deception. On 6 September 2005 he was given a life sentence. On 25 April 2007, the BBC reported that Robert Hendy-Freegard had appealed against his kidnapping convictions and won. His life sentence was revoked but still served nine years for the other offences. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) judgment played an important role in defining the modern offence of kidnap.R. v.

The Prussian Order Pour le M√©rite in war and in peace. Colonel Max Hermann Bauer (31 January 1869 ‚Äì 6 May 1929) was a German General Staff officer and artillery expert in the First World War. As a protege of Erich Ludendorff he was placed in charge of the German Army's munition supply by the latter in 1916. In this role he played a leading role in the Hindenburg Programme and the High Command's political machinations. Later Bauer was a military and industrial adviser to the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek. Rising in the army Bauer was born in Quedlinburg. He began to study medicine in Berlin, but then enlisted as an officer candidate in Foot Artillery Regiment 2 (heavy artillery) in 1888. The following year he attended the Kriegs-Schule in Hanover and then was commissioned. After regimental service, in 1898 he was appointed Adjutant to the Artillerie-Pr√ºfungskommission (Artillery Testing Commission). In 1902 he took command of a battery as a captain. An observer of the Russo-Japanese war (1904-5), he was impressed by how Japanese 28 cm mortars demolished Russian forts. When he returned in 1905 he joined the fortress section of the General Staff as their artillery expert, which made him conversant with the leaders of German industry, science, and engineering. Unable to obtain authorization to develop a new heavy mortar, he ordered one from Krupp nonetheless. When the War Ministry learned that a prototype was completed they wanted Bauer dismissed, but the firing tests were so impressive that further development was authorized in 1911. Meanwhile, in 1908 he moved into the mobilization section of the Staff directed by Erich Ludendorff ‚Äî they became staunch friends. Ludendorff regarded him as the ‚Äúsmartest officer in the army‚Äù. In the following year Bauer was appointed as a General Staff Officer, remarkable because he had not had the customary specialized schooling. Helped by his contacts in industry, he studied how the German economy would function during a European war.  The first years of World War I When the war came Major Bauer was posted to the Operations Section of Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, Supreme Army Command) as head of Section II, which was responsible for heavy artillery, mortars, and fortresses. Earlier in 1914, the first of the Krupp 42cm mortars, nicknamed \\"Big Bertha\\", and its concrete-piercing shells were ready. They smashed the forts in Belgium and northern France. In 1915 the huge guns forced the surrender of the formidable Russian fortifications in Poland, like Przemy≈õl, before dealing with the Serbian strongholds at Belgrade. For developing the mortars Bauer was awarded the Pour le M√©rite and an honorary doctorate from the University of Berlin. (In 1918 he received the Oak Leaves for his Pour le M√©rite. During the war he was awarded 25 German and foreign medals.) Before the war he had worked with the chemist Fritz Haber to transform nitrogen from the air into explosive precursors, which let the Germans make war despite the Naval blockade of Germany preventing continued imports of supplies of nitrates that had come from Chile before the war. When the adversaries deadlocked in their trenches along the Western Front, Haber suggested that they could break through by releasing a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas, which is heavier than air. Bauer provided funds and scientists already in the army. Bauer, Haber and Duisberg, the head of the chemical cartel, and their horses were poisoned at the first field test; all were invalided for days. He was present at the first attack, which cleared the defenders out of miles of trenches defending the city of Ypres, but was \\"heartbroken\\" because Supreme Commander Erich von Falkenhayn had mounted only a diversionary attack, divulging their top-secret for almost no gain.Bauer, Oberst (1922). Der Grosse Krieg im Feld und Heimat. T√ºbingen: Oftander'sche Buchhandlung, p. 69. Bauer continued to support the development of new gases, tactics to use them effectively despite protective masks, and Haber's mobilization of scientists for the war effort. Section II of OHL Supreme Army Command carefully evaluated how their weapons performed on active service. For instance, in 1916 they produced a modified field gun that could be elevated to 40 degrees, compared to its former 16 degrees, and their light howitzer's range was increased 43 percent to . They formed a unit to develop assault tactics using stormtroopers. Their first tank, introduced in May 1917, was too large and unwieldy, few were produced, so they had to use captured enemy tanks. Krupp and Daimler designed a light tank, but production was not authorized until French light tanks showed their value, consequently they could not be available until April 1919.Bauer, 1922, p. 229.Voght, 1974, p. 525. Bauer strongly opposed Falkenhayn's plan to attack Verdun in 1916 along a narrow front on the right bank of the Meuse, because their flank would be vulnerable to French artillery on the left bankhe was spot-on; before long they had to attack the left bank as well. While arranging artillery support before the attack he stayed at Fifth Army headquarters where he became a fast friend of its commander, Crown Prince Wilhelm; they kept in touch thereafter. In the first salvo of the attack a 42 cm shell struck Fort Douaumont, a key to the defense. It did not penetrate the reinforced concrete and sand layers: the Verdun forts were stouter than any the mortars had fired on hitherto. Later that year Bauer was dismayed by Falkenhayn's insistence along the Somme front on packing infantry into the foremost trenches to repel the attacks, where they were chewed-up by the Entente's artillery preparations. Bauer decided that Falkenhayn must be replaced by his friend Ludendorff, who had displayed virtuosity on the Eastern Front. Supported by junior officers at OHL he tirelessly lobbied the highest echelons of the army and government against his superior, with criticisms of Falkenhayn like \\"...his decisions were half measures and he wavered even over these.\\" Falkenhayn was replaced on 29 August 1916 by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of Staff with First Quartermaster General Ludendorff as his associate. To Bauer this was his greatest victory. Total War The new commanders resolved to wage total war. OHL Supreme Army Command was reorganized, Bauer's Section II was responsible for heavy artillery, mortars and fortresses. Bauer set highly optimistic goals for weapon production, for instance tripling machine gun output, in what became known as the Hindenburg Program. His industrialist friends welcomed the orders but needed more workers. Skilled men were released from the armed forces and a bill making most men and women subject to national service was proposed to the Reichstag, which rejected the most extreme measures, like shutting the universities except for their medical schools. Compelling women to work was unnecessary, because already more were looking than there were jobs. The bill that finally passed was almost useless. Soon Bauer had a staff officer for propaganda and another stationed in Berlin for political liaison. Despite their exertions, \\"Unable to control labour and unwilling to control industry, the army failed miserably....\\" Lieutenant General von H√∂hn's draft of a manual describing defense in depth was rewritten by Bauer and Captain Geyer.Bauer, 1922, p. 119. The crux was that any attackers who penetrated a lightly manned front line would be destroyed by counterattacks. Defense in depth became German Army doctrine through the Second World War. OHL relied on his political judgment. Ludendorff and Bauer saw eye to eye: to them \\"To govern means to dominate.\\" So of course they despised Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg who tried to govern by consensus and hoped to negotiate a peace. They lobbied fervently against him. Bethmann was pressured into agreeing to unrestricted submarine warfare, which brought the United States into the war. On 10 June 1917 Bauer gave Matthias Erzberger, a leading catholic Reichstag deputy, a private, pessimist briefing, including his assessment that the U-boats could not win the war. Bauer had misfired. Instead of backing the struggle with a stiffer spine, Erzberger tabled a resolution for a negotiated peace without annexations. OHL fought back fiercely. The Crown Prince visited Berlin to pressure legislators. Bauer stayed in the capital, in the thick of the fight. Hindenburg and Ludendorff came there to threaten to resign. The Kaiser told them \\"there could be no justification for their presence in Berlin.\\"De Gaulle, 2002, p., 104. They retreated to Headquarters to tweak their tactics. On 11 July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff telegraphed their resignations unless Bethmann Hollweg was replaced and immediately released the telegrams to the press. Bethmann Hollweg resigned. The resolution was amended to call for \\"a peace of equilibrium\\" and passed by 212 to 126. It was ignored by the new Chancellor Georg Michaelis. OHL Supreme Army Command was in the political driver's seat, but their only objective was total victory. Bauer worked with Krupp on the development of antiaircraft artillery and of the Paris guns that fired shells Vogt,1974, p. 518. but failed to dent civilian morale. In 1918 OHL unleashed a series of massive attacks to bring victory. Each attack began with a multi-million shell hurricane artillery bombardment. Bauer assembled the guns that were commanded by Colonel Bruchm√ºller. Repeatedly they broke through British and French lines. After four successful months an attack on the French along the Marne River was bloodily repulsed and then on 17 July 1918 the right flank of their salient pointing towards Paris was crushed by a powerful, joint French and American attack led by massed tanks. Bauer realized that the war was lost and that \\"in decency‚Äù it should be ended.Bauer, 1922, p. 135. He notified his industrialist friends. Bauer and the Crown Prince agreed that Germany needed a dictator, their choice was Ludendorff. Their misreading of the nation's political situation was exposed when Ludendorff was dismissed on 25 October so despised that for safety he fled the country. Vice-Chancellor Friedrich von Payer, the only member of the administration also in the Reichstag, excoriated Bauer for his un-military political meddling. Bauer took this dressing-down as a tribute to his invaluable work; but he retired from active service on 31 October 1918, a few months after being promoted to Colonel. A close student of the war described Bauer: \\"There is a strange mixture of force and weakness, calculation and abandon, intelligence and illogic in this man.\\" Post-war He wrote about his experiences and national policy during the war. In 1920 Bauer and Ludendorff were among the leaders of the right-wing Kapp Putsch, which seized control of the government. They were forced out by a nationwide general strike. Ludendorff was let off but Bauer had to flee the country. He worked as a military consultant in the Soviet Union, Spain and Argentina. He returned to Germany in 1925 following an amnesty for all those involved in the Putsch. In 1926, Chinese engineer Chu Chia-hua, president of the Sun Yat-Sen University in Canton, contacted Bauer for advice on military and business opportunities in China. In 1927, Bauer visited Chiang Kai-shek, who hired him as a military adviser, wishing to use his contacts to acquire more weapons and industrial assistance from Germany. This began Sino-German cooperation until 1941. In 1928, Bauer returned to Germany to make contacts with German industries and the army. However, the Treaty of Versailles restricted arms production. In addition, he was persona non grata to the German government as he had participated in the Kapp Putsch. Nonetheless Bauer was able to establish a China trade department and to make contact with the secret German military mission in Nanking. When Bauer returned to China, he advocated formation of a small core army supported by many local militia forces. Chiang did not use these ideas, since the militias would have concentrated military power in local hands. However, Bauer did manage to have the Whampoa Military Academy moved from Canton to Nanking,Fox, 1970. it became the Central Military Academy, and to staff it with German military advisers and instructors. He invited 20 German officers to China to work as instructors in military training and military intelligence. Officially, Bauer was Chiang's economic adviser and encouraged him to develop infrastructure. Max Bauer died in Shanghai, of smallpox, on 6 May 1929, perhaps as a result of having been intentionally infected by one of his Chinese enemies, as he was the only person infected with the contagious disease in the region where he contracted it. He was buried in China with military honors. His ashes were later returned to Germany and buried at Swinem√ºnde on 5 August 1929.Fox, 1970.

He was the founder of Lettrism, an art and literary movement which owed inspiration to Dada and Surrealism. An important figure in the mid-20th Century avant-garde, he is remembered in the cinema world chiefly for his revolutionary 1951 film Trait√© de Bave et d'Eternit√©, while his political writings are seen as foreshadowing the May 1968 movements.  Early life  Isidor Goldstein was born in 1925 to a prominent Jewish family in Boto≈üani. Despite his wealthy upbringing (his father was a successful entrepreneur and serial restaurateur), he left school at age 15, reading extensively at home and doing odd jobs. P. 14. In 1944 he began his literary career as an avant-garde art journalist during World War II, shortly after the 23 August coup that saw Romania joining the Allies. With the future social psychologist Serge Moscovici, he founded the magazine Da, which was soon after closed down by the authorities. Serge Moscovici. Rep√®res bio-bibliographiques , at the Institut de Psychologie; retrieved 1 August 2007. Soon after he became interested in the Zionist cause and collaborated with A.L. Zissu on the Zionist publication ‚ÄùM√¢ntuirea‚Äù. After several attempts to obtain a French visa earlier during the war, he left Romania clandestinely in August 1945, carrying a suitcase full of early manuscripts. He initially traveled to Italy, where fellow experimental poet Giuseppe Ungaretti gave him a letter of introduction and recommendation under the pseudonym \\"Isidore Isou\\" to French writer Jean Paulhan, which made his entry into the literary world of the newly-liberated Paris much easier.  Lettrism  Intending a total artistic renewal starting from the most basic elements of writing and visual communication, Isidore Isou, assisted by Gabriel Pommerand, organized the first Lettriste manifestation in Paris, on 8 January 1946. During the premiere of dadaist and fellow Romanian Tristan Tzara's play La Fuit at the Theatre du Vieux-Colombier, Isou shouted \\"Dada is dead! Lettrism has taken its place!\\" Through this and other similar stunts ‚Äì as well as with the help of Jean Paulhan and Raymond Queneau, who placed his work in La Nouvelle Revue in April, 1947 ‚Äì he came to the attention of Gaston Gallimard, who then accepted his memoire \\"L'Agr√©gation d'un Nom et d'un Messie\\" for publication. In 1949, the young Isou published the novel Isou ou la m√©canique des femmes (Isou, or the Mechanics of Women), inspired by his obsessions with the 16-year-old muse and later conceptual artist Rhea Sue Sanders. This book was banned by the authorities on 9 May 1950 and Isou was briefly imprisoned and sentenced to prison for eight months (his sentence was suspended); a fine of 2000 francs was imposed along with the destruction of all copies of a book which 1950s' French jurisprudence considered completely obscene.B√©n√©dicte Demelas: Des mythes et des r√©alit√©s de l'avant-garde fran√ßaise. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988. The same year, he also published the first of his works on political theory: Trait√© d'√©conomie nucl√©aire: Le soul√®vement de la jeunesse (Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising). Lettrism continued to grow as a movement, becoming less dependent on the work of Isou himself. Maurice Lema√Ætre, Jean-Louis Brau, Gil J. Wolman and Serge Berna joined the group in 1950, with Guy Debord joining in early 1951, after meeting the Lettrists at the 4th Cannes Film Festival. Debord quickly became an important figure in the so-called left wing of the Lettrists, which were more politically active and overtly \\"dedicated to Marxist teachings and the critique of capitalist societies\\". In October 1952, while Charlie Chaplin was on an extensive publicity tour for his film Limelight, the Lettrist left wing, led by Debord, disrupted a press conference at the H√¥tel Ritz Paris and distributed a pamphlet called ‚ÄúFinis les pieds plats‚Äù (‚ÄúNo More Flat Feet!‚Äù) through which they espoused their belief that \\"the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they present themselves in the name of freedom\\", claimed that the \\"leaflet was an attack against a unanimous, servile enthusiasm\\" and that Chaplin was an \\"emotional blackmailer, master-singer of misfortune\\". Isou was an admirer of Chaplin's films and he considered the cinema legend to be undeserving of this attack. The conflict that arose within the Lettrists because of this notorious incident led to Debord and his group becoming the first splinter group that separated from the Lettrists, forming the Letterist International. Five years later, they would join others to form the Situationist International, an artistic and political organization that would go on to become more famous and influential than any of its predecessors by playing a major role in the events of May 1968.  Film  In 1951, Isou released his first movie, the experimental film Trait√© de bave et d'√©ternit√© (Treatise on Venom And Eternity), whose premiere took place at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the film was not officially entered in the festival, it was widely publicized in the press and its screening constituted one of the festival's fringe events. While threatening to form his own jury to judge the film, Isou went door to door, harassing the administrators of the festival until they agreed to grant him a small, peripheral exhibition. The film consisted of \\"four and a half hours [...] of 'discordant' images, enhanced with scratches, shaky footage running upside down or in reverse, blank frames, stock shots and a soundtrack consisting of monologues and onomatopoeic poetry\\". In addition, the celluloid on which the film was recorded was attacked with destructive techniques such as scratches and bleaching. In one of the film's voiceovers, Isou states his opinion on the medium: > \\"I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached > its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will > outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this greased > pig will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the destruction of the > cinema, the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this > corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.\\" Following its screening, the work was deemed revolting by many critics present at the premiere. The film was booed and hissed from the start, but after the first section was completed and the screen went completely blank with the audio still going, the audience was furious and the screening had to be stopped. It was, nonetheless, celebrated by Cannes jury member Jean Cocteau, who called it ‚Äúthe most beautiful scandal of the entire festival‚Äù and handed Isou a hastily concocted ‚ÄúPrix de spectateurs d‚Äôavant-garde‚Äù. Including a reflexive discourse on the making of a new cinema, Isou's film became a virtual Lettriste manifesto. Following the scandal after the film's showing at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival, it was later imported into the United States, where it influenced avant-garde film makers such as Stan Brakhage, who corresponded with Isou directly afterward and let it change his approach to the medium and to narrative entirely. In the early 1950s, one segment of Orson Welles' film journal, which was entitled Le Letrrisme est la Poesie en Vogue, included an interview with Isou and Maurice Lema√Ætre.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZayMaC4RLo  Final years and death  In the 1980s, Isidore Isou was accorded French citizenship. His final public appearance was at the University of Paris on 21 October 2000, aged 75.David Seaman, Isidore Isou a la Sorbonne, at Thing.net; retrieved 1 August 2007 He is buried in the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.  Legacy  In the 1960s Lettrist, Lettrist-influenced works and Isidore Isou gained a certain amount of respect in France. Former co-agitators of Isou, writer Guy Debord and artist Gil J. Wolman broke away in 1952 to form the Lettrist International. It later merged with the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, and the London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International, a dissident revolutionary group. In this new form, using means acquired over the course of a decade prior, Lettrist art exerted a profound influence upon the posters, barricades, even designs for clothing in the attempted revolution of 1968. Isou would go on to claim that his 1950 manifesto Youth Uprising: First Manifesto was a catalyst for the events of the 1968. Members of his Lettrist group are still active, among them cineast and writer Roland Sabatier and film director Fr√©d√©rique Devaux. Many of Isou's works, and those of the other Lettrists, have recently been reprinted in new editions, together with much hitherto unpublished material, most notably Isou's extensive (1,390 pages) La Cr√©atique ou la Novatique (1941-1976). In July 2007, Kino International released the DVD collection Avant-Garde 2: Experimental Films 1928-1954, which included Isou's film Trait√© de Bave et d'√àternit√© (Venom and Eternity) (1951).

Little is known for certain about her life; her tumultuous career and flamboyant lifestyle were the subject of gossip, rumor, and colourful stories in her own time, and inspired numerous fictional and semi-fictional portrayals afterwards. Th√©ophile Gautier loosely based the title character, Madeleine de Maupin, of his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835) on her. Early life Julie d'Aubigny was born in 1673 pp. 350-352 - archive.org to Gaston d'Aubigny, a secretary to Louis de Lorraine- Guise, comte d'Armagnac, the Master of the Horse for King Louis XIV. Her father trained the court pages, and so his daughter learned dancing, reading, drawing, and fencing alongside the pages. In 1687, the Count d'Armagnac had her married to Sieur de Maupin of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and she became Madame de Maupin (or simply \\"La Maupin\\" per French custom). Soon after the wedding, her husband received an administrative position in the south of France, but the Count kept her in Paris for his own purposes. Youth Also around 1687, D'Aubigny became involved with an assistant fencing master named S√©rannes. When Lieutenant-General of Police Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie tried to apprehend S√©rannes for killing a man in an illegal duel, the pair fled the city to Marseille. On the road south, D'Aubigny and S√©rannes made a living by giving fencing exhibitions and singing in taverns and at local fairs. While travelling and performing in these impromptu shows, La Maupin dressed in male clothing but did not conceal her sex. On arrival in Marseille, she joined the opera company run by Pierre Gaultier, singing under her maiden name. D'Aubigny left for Paris and again earned her living by singing. Near Poitiers, she met an old actor named Mar√©chal who began to teach her until his alcoholism got worse and he sent her on her way to Paris. Opera and adult life The Paris Op√©ra hired La Maupin in 1690, having initially refused her. She befriended an elderly singer, Bouvard, and he and Th√©venard convinced Jean-Nicolas de Francine, master of the king's household, to accept her into the company. She debuted as Pallas Athena in Cadmus et Hermione by Jean-Baptiste Lully the same year. She performed regularly with the Op√©ra, first singing as a soprano, and later in her more natural contralto range. The Marquis de Dangeau wrote in his journal of a performance by La Maupin given at Trianon of Destouches' Omphale in 1701 that hers was \\"the most beautiful voice in the world\\". In Paris, and later in Brussels, she performed under the name Mademoiselle de Maupin because singers were addressed as \\"mademoiselle\\" whether or not they were married. Until 1705, La Maupin sang in new operas by Pascal Collasse, Andr√© Cardinal Destouches, and Andr√© Campra. In 1702, Andr√© Campra composed the role of Clorinde in Tancr√®de specifically for her bas-dessus (contralto) range. She sang for the court at Versailles on a number of occasions, and again performed in many of the Op√©ra's major productions. She appeared for the last time in La V√©nitienne by Michel de La Barre (1705). She retired from the opera in 1705 and took refuge in a convent, probably in Provence, where she is believed to have died in 1707 at the age of 33. Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin The fictional Mademoiselle de Maupin, from Six Drawings Illustrating Th√©ophile Gautier's Romance Mademoiselle de Maupin by Aubrey Beardsley, 1898 Th√©ophile Gautier, when asked to write a story about d'Aubigny, instead produced the novel Mademoiselle de Maupin, published in 1835, taking aspects of the real La Maupin as a starting point, and naming some of the characters after her and her acquaintances. The central character's life was viewed through a romantic lens as \\"all for love\\". D'Albert and his mistress Rosette are both in love with the androgynous Th√©odore de S√©rannes, whom neither of them knows is really Madeleine de Maupin. A performance of Shakespeare's As You Like It, in which La Maupin, who is passing as Th√©odore, plays the part of Rosalind playing Ganymede, mirrors the cross-dressing pretense of the heroine. The celebration of sensual love, regardless of gender, was radical, and the book was banned by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and authorities elsewhere.

The northbound opened in 1972 and the southbound in 1993. They are known for their family-run business which eschews the typical facilities at British motorway services for a farm shop and buildings in keeping with the local environment. Location The services are between junctions 38 and 39 on the ascent from the Lune Valley to Shap summit. As the north and southbound carriageways diverge at this point, the two service areas are not actually adjacent to each other but a couple of hundred metres apart. History Tebay West Services, which serves the northbound carriageway, opened in 1972, two years after the M6 section between Lancaster and Penrith was completed. The M6 here passes through an environmentally sensitive area, and the services were sited in this location to fit in with the surrounding local area and provide a view away from the motorway. A corresponding southbound services, Killington Lake Services, was constructed at the same time. Tebay East was opened in 1993, serving southbound traffic. Both are operated by an independent family-owned company, Westmorland Motorway Services, rather than a national chain. The same company runs Truckstop Services at junction 38, which opened in 1986 and caters for HGV and long- distance coaches, and Gloucester Services between junctions 11a and 12 of the M5 in Gloucestershire, which was built into the side of a hill and covered with grass to reduce its visual impact. Facilities Tebay Services are in open countryside surrounded by trees, small lakes and panoramas of the Cumbrian landscape, and has its own duck pond. Westmorland shun typical motorway service food outlets. Instead, both Tebay outlets have award-winning farm shops, which sell local meat and other food, and insist on using local suppliers. The services have been praised as being the best in the country. In 2003, Westmorland won Best Local Retailer in BBC Radio 4's Food and Farming Awards, and in 2006 they were awarded Best Motorway Services in Britain by Which?. The farm shops, which sell locally sourced produce, were officially opened by Prince Charles in 2004. In addition, the northbound service area has a caravan park and a hotel.

The purpose of this child-led organization is to protect working minors through the establishment of local benefit societies, awareness campaigns to influence public opinion, and negotiations with political authorities. The movement has a bulletin entitled Lettre de la rue and in 1999 it published the book Voix des enfants d'Afrique (\\"Voice of the children of Africa\\"), which has been translated into several languages. The movement was formally created in July 1994 in Bouak√© (C√¥te d'Ivoire), where the first international meeting was held. At the Bouak√© meeting, the movement's \\"vision\\" and a list of 12 priority rights for working children were outlined: Vision: All African children must be born and grow in good condition, and enjoy their full rights to thrive, while at the same time helping their communities to develop harmoniously in peace and in a favorable environment. Priority rights: # The right to be respected # The right to be taught a trade # The right to stay in the village (not to migrate) # The right to work in a safe environment # The right to light and limited work # The right to rest when sick # The right to be listened to # The right to healthcare # The right to learn to read and to write # The right to play # The right to self-expression and to form organizations # The right to equitable legal aid, in case of difficulty.

After the character's introduction in the second book in the series as a supporting antagonist, Colfer again used Koboi as the main antagonist of the fourth, sixth, and eighth books in the series, giving her the status of archenemy to Artemis Fowl II. She is voiced by Hong Chau in the 2020 film in an uncredited capacity (dubbing over stand-in actors Emily Brockmann, Jessica Rhodes, and Charlie Cameron), physically portraying the character in a deleted scene. Introduction Colfer first brought the Opal Koboi character into the Artemis Fowl series through the May 2002 publication of Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident. Koboi was written in this second book of the series as an evil genius responsible for the highest level of planning and execution of a war by goblins using outlawed lethal lasers against the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance (LEPrecon) police squad, shutting off all the LEP's power and blaming her only scientific rival Foaly for the entire affair. She employs Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon, a LEPrecon officer who was disgraced in the prequel, as her partner in her attempt to stage this coup deep in the bowels of the Earth. However, at the climax of the book, Artemis reveals that Cudgeon plans to betray Koboi. Koboi flies into a rage and attacks Cudgeon. In the ensuing struggle, Cudgeon is electrocuted to death by falling into live plasma tubes and Koboi is incapacitated. She then falls into a self-induced coma as part of a plan to escape imprisonment. With statements such as \\"before her second birthday she had dismantled her first hard drive,\\" the Opal Koboi character comes off as precocious, but not in a positive way. Described as an \\"insane, power-mad pixie\\" and an outrageous character that is confident of her own intelligence in a way that annoys other people, this beauteous \\"pixie with the golden touch\\" contributes to the Colfer idea that fairies are basically as bad as humans ‚Äì and fight even dirtier. The name Koboi sounds both as \\"cowboy\\" and \\"kobold\\", a temperamental sprite of German folklore who becomes outraged when not fed properly, and who sometimes is referred to as a spirit of caves and mines, which fits since the fairies of the series live underground. In this way, the name Koboi suits the gold-digger Opal Koboi. It is also known that Koboi bankrupted her father's business after he tried to dissuade her from studying engineering (as he expected his daughter to follow the normal path in life for female pixies: namely, marrying a suitable husband) and that she has a long, bitter rivalry with Foaly since their days at university, and that one of Opal's main goals is to prove she is intellectually superior to the centaur. The only reason to this hatred between the two magical creatures is that Foaly won their University's science fair with his iris-cam, which Opal found stupid and to which she thought that her Koboi wings were far superior. She then accuses the centaur of winning only because he was a male. Subsequent appearances Opal Koboi returns as the titular antagonist in Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, which was published in April 2005 as the fourth book of the fictional series, following her absence in Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code. In this installment, Colfer describes Opal Koboi's coma situation from the perspective of Doctor Jerbal Argon, a fictional fairy gnome psychiatrist taking care of his incarcerated, \\"celebrity\\" patient: > \\"If only every fairy in the facility was as docile as Opal Koboi. All she > needed was a few intravenous tubes and a monitor, which had been more than > paid for by her first six months' medical fees. Doctor Argon fervently hoped > that little Opal never woke up. Because once she did, the LEP would haul her > off to court. And when she had been convicted of treason her assets would be > frozen, including the Clinic's fund. No, the longer Opal's nap lasted, the > better for everyone, especially her. Because of their thin skulls and large > brain volume, Pixies were susceptible to various maladies such as catatonia, > amnesia and narcolepsy.\\" Rather than being in an actual coma, Colfer has Koboi in a coma-like state of meditation known as a \\"cleansing coma\\" to elude punishment for her own criminal activities. Koboi awakens herself from the faked coma, leaves a clone of herself under guard in a coma and disguises herself as a human child, and breaks out of prison to take revenge and dominate the world both of fairies and humans. Koboi's plan is to bring the Fairy People in contact with humans, \\"who until now have been completely ignorant of their existence below the surface of the earth, but by their nature manage to ruin everything they touch.\\" Koboi, who plans to install herself as supreme world ruler, is opposed by both Captain Holly Short, a talkative elf in the LEP, and Artemis Fowl, a 14-year-old criminal mastermind from a super-criminal family dynasty and the main character of the series. Colfer makes their opposition to Opal Koboi more difficult by erasing Fowl's memory of the wicked Opal Koboi and the other fairy people through a Foaly mindwipe and by having Koboi frame Captain Holly Short for a murder that in fact was committed by Koboi. Even though Opal has laid out death traps for Artemis and Holly in a troll-infested amusement park, Holly eventually is able to restore Artemis' memory and the two of them stop Opal. At the end of Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, Colfer has the reader assuming that Koboi is safely locked up in an LEP prison. She also appears in Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox, as the main antagonist again. Artemis and Holly tangle with a past version of Koboi. She had realized that by absorbing parts of different (usually rare) animals, she can modify her magic. By now she can levitate, shoot lightning, and has a more advanced Mesmer. She plans to use the Silky Sifaka Lemur to channel her magic into Time Travel which she will use to become a leader. At the climax of the book, she has been revealed to have traveled to the current time, and was defeated but unapprehended. The consequences of her leaving the past have yet to be resolved. Colfer used the fourth novel to describe Opal Koboi's hysterical megalomania in significant detail. Coming across as embittered, slightly loony, deranged and dangerous, ultra-evil, and world domination-obsessed, Colfer has the criminal mastermind Koboi go \\"mind-to-mind\\" against a similarly intelligent and criminal mastermind Fowl. Strangely, in The Time Paradox, she seemed insane on a level which was not evident in The Arctic Incident (It is suggested in The Last Guardian that this is because the timeline that created this Opal has diverged from the timeline that created the 'present' Opal), even deciding to think about choosing to shoot down the moon after using the term in a thought. In The Atlantis Complex, Artemis suspects Opal of the attack on Atlantis until he discovers that the enemy is Turnball Root, disgraced brother of the late Commander Julius Root. There is also reference to her present, human self- being relocated during an attack on a prison- although she is contained in a metal box to prevent her escaping-, as well as a reference to the rumour that her past self is active in the present and maybe trying to free her. In The Last Guardian, Opal deliberately arranges for the execution of her own past self- although she speculates that the younger she is merely an alternate Opal due to her own lack of memory of this events-, with the resulting energy explosion as everything that Opal Koboi has created and done over the five years between her past and present self is erased causing a social collapse as multiple Koboi technologies are destroyed or cease to exist. However, Opal manages to survive after tricking the LEP into moving her present self into a radiation-proof tube, channeling the energy release as her body becomes a paradox to regrow her entire body. She subsequently releases a group of long- imprisoned warrior spirits to serve as her army while she works to activate a doomsday spell that will wipe all human life from Earth's surface, but Artemis is able to defeat her by using her clone- now 'trained' to perform simple movements- to instead activate a command that will disperse the energy and the spirits while leaving Earth unharmed, the resulting energy release also destroying Opal's powers. She is finally killed by one of her warrior spirits. Abilities Koboi is noted as having an IQ of 300. In The Time Paradox she is discovered to be illegally harvesting animal brain fluid and body parts and using their potency to augment her magical abilities; she is able to levitate unaided, release concussive energy waves, conjure fireballs (a gift only goblins are mentioned as having), and has acute mind control, much more powerful than the standard Mesmer; she is also able to absorb memories, wiping Mulch Diggums' mind clean of all the events of The Time Paradox in the process; she also seeks out the silky sifaka lemur Jayjay as his brain fluid would allow her to time travel, an ability only the demon warlocks Qwan and No1 are able to use. On top of this, she is able to use remote psychokinesis on such a level that she is able to mimic the complex symptoms of the fairy disease Spelltropy perfectly, fooling even Foaly's sensors into believing Artemis' mother has actually contracted the disease. When she is shot with a tranquilizer dart by Artemis Fowl, she inadvertently conjures several images by projecting them through manipulating magical sparks and marshaling them into a recognizable shape, again a power only Qwan and No.1 are noted as having. Finally, she prizes her ability to shoot lightning bolts from her fingertips; however, it requires a lot of magic and great concentration to muster them. It is worth noting, however, that the human pituitary gland she surgically installed has robbed her of all her magical powers, rendering all that time she spent gathering brain fluids to augment her powers useless. She later has the pituitary gland removed and uses the power caused by the paradox of killing her past self to generate even greater magical power, able to reconstruct the molecular structure of anything around her and fire plasma blasts capable of vaporizing a fairy, but this does not stop her being fatally stabbed by one of her summoned Berserkers.

It is situated on the edge of Otago Harbour, and is named for pioneer European settler James Macandrew who lived here during his later life. The Te Reo MƒÅori name for the bay, Te Roto PƒÅteke, refers to the Brown teal (MƒÅori: PƒÅteke) formerly prevalent in the area.Otago Daily Times, Waterways of the area, April 4, 2016. Early European residents of the area called the bay \\"The Hundreds\\", due to the large number of boulders which covered the foreshore. Macandrew Bay is a suburb of Dunedin, but has the feel of an isolated coastal settlement and is often regarded as a separate township, even though the heart of the city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour. It is both a commuter and a harbourside retreat from the city. Macandrew Bay's 2001 population was 1131. The Otago Harbour as seen from the ridge which runs along the top of the Otago Peninsula. The settlements of Company Bay (upper middle of picture) and Macandrew Bay (bottom of picture) are both shown. The settlement centres on an area around the junction of Portobello Road and Greenacres Street, the latter a narrow road which rises steeply towards the interior of the Peninsula. Greenacres Street roughly follows the valley of the small Rodgers Creek. The community hall lies on the lower part of Greenacres Street close to its junction with Portobello Road, and the settlement's few shops lie immediately to the southwest of the junction. Behind these shops lie the community's primary school and cemetery, the latter of which includes the grave of James Macandrew. The bay has a small beach opposite the shops, which is well-used by the public. The beach was created artificially, with sand brought to the bay from the nearby Pacific coast. The area around the beach has been turned into a small public park, and landscaping of this was completed in 1979.Hamel, A. (2008) Dunedin tracks and trails. Dunedin: Silver Peaks Press. pp. 4.05-06 Macandrew Bay is the largest of several settlements which lie on the harbour coast of Otago Peninsula. Between it and Dunedin lies Glenfalloch, a private gardens open to the public. Beyond Macandrew Bay to the northeast lie Company Bay and Raynbirds Bay and to the southwest is Colinswood, the latter named for James Macandrew's house. These small settlements could be considered \\"suburbs\\" of Macandrew Bay. Beyond Raynbirds Bay lie Broad Bay and Portobello. These settlements are connected to each other and to Dunedin's city centre by Portobello Road, a winding road which runs along the harbour coast of the peninsula.New Zealand Automobile Association.

Use during apartheid Toyi-toyi was often used for intimidating the South African police and security forces during anti-apartheid demonstrations. The toyi-toyi was also used with chants such as the African National Congress's \\"Amandla\\" (\\"power\\") and \\"Awethu\\" (\\"ours\\") or the Pan African Congress's \\"One Settler, One Bullet\\". After the 1976 Soweto massacre, the anti-apartheid movement became more militant. The toyi-toyi, a military march dance and song style became commonplace in massive street demonstrations. As one activist puts it, \\"The toyi-toyi was our weapon. We did not have the technology of warfare, the tear gas and tanks, but we had this weapon.\\" Current use in South Africa After Apartheid ended, people have used toyi-toyi to express their grievances against current government policies.

The organization currently operates programs in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Croatia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Jordan, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Uganda, Rwanda, the United States and Vietnam. Survivor Corps is a leading proponent of the peer support method, in which survivors are linked to one another to share information as well as emotional and practical support, and work together on issues affecting their lives. The Survivor Corps peer support program connects survivors with survivor role models to offer encouragement and motivation. Peer support is used to help new survivors find hope, get jobs, and get on with their lives. Survivor Corps also brings conflict survivors together to promote reconciliation and rebuilding through community service projects and local activism. By training and organizing survivor advocates to campaign for their rights, survivor corps has brought the voices of survivors into international negotiations, to ban weapons that cause unacceptable harm to civilians and to honor the rights of survivors of war and of persons with disabilities. In May 2008, Survivor Corps emerged from Landmine Survivors Network. The name change reflects the expansion of the organization's mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Nobel Prize and international leadership  Survivor Corps has long played a leading role the International Campaign to Ban Landmines coalition (ICBL), which has over 1100 member organizations and whose goal is to abolish the production and use of anti-personnel landmines. Survivor Corps co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford helped lead the coalition's efforts that secured the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which in turn earned the coalition the Nobel Peace Prize. Prominent Survivor Corps supporters have included Queen Noor of Jordan and Diana, Princess of Wales. The Mine Ban Treaty bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of antipersonnel mines. It was also the first arms control agreement in history to require governments to provide assistance to victims of the weapon. This was achieved by an unprecedented level of participation by survivors in the treaty process.Cameron MA, Lawson RJ, Tomlin BW. To walk without fear : the global movement to ban landmines. Toronto; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Chapter 7, \\"The Role of the Landmine Survivors Network,\\" pp. 99-117. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entered into force on May 3, 2008, affecting 650 million people with disabilities around the world, including survivors of violent conflict. Survivor Corps helped ensure that this progressive human rights treaty addressed persons with disabilities not as charity cases, but as equal and autonomous citizens entitled to their human rights and full participation in society. The Convention on Cluster Munitions was signed in Oslo on December 3, 2008 and entered into force on 1 August 2010. It bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of cluster bombs due to the indiscriminate harm they cause to civilians. As a leader on the steering committee of the Cluster Munitions Coalition, Survivor Corps used its past experience with the Mine Ban Treaty to help ensure that the Convention on Cluster Munitions included the strongest possible requirements to provide assistance to victims of the weapon, their families and communities. Legacy Over the course of several years, Survivor Corps established the first database designed to track the rehabilitation needs of mine victims and the resources available to help survivors, their families, and the communities affected by anti-personnel mines. In 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales visited Bosnia with LSN co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford to meet landmine survivors. Her high-profile tour of the war-torn country brought global media attention and public support to the issue of landmines. After the death of Diana, the organization became the only American-based charity to receive support from the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Also in 1997, Queen Noor of Jordan stepped in to take a prominent role in supporting the organization's work. In 1999, along with Queen Noor and key members of the United States Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, the organization drew international attention to the refusal of the United States to sign the Mine Ban Treaty, while appealing to the US to revisit landmine policy. From 1997 to 2007, LSN provided health support, economic opportunity and human rights advocacy for survivors of landmines around the world.  Landmine Survivors Network becomes Survivor Corps  In May 2008, Landmine Survivors Network changed its name to Survivor Corps. The name change reflects the expansion of their mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Survivor Corps expanded its programs into Israel, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and created additional projects in Colombia.  Transition in 2010  In early 2010 Survivor Corps elected to make its country programs in Vietnam, El Salvador and Bosnia into independent NGOs and to transfer its peer support resources to the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery located at James Madison University. On September 30, 2010 Survivor Corps closed its headquarters office in Washington DC.

In the year 2001, its population was 1,905, recounted to 1,494 at the United Kingdom Census 2011. Note: The 2001 figure is for the whole civil parish whereas the 2011 figure is for the village only. The electoral ward with the same name had a population of 1,875 at the above census. The parish has three pubs: The Lamb, The Ruffwell Inn, and The Silverton Inn. The church, dating back to the fourteenth century, is dedicated to St Mary. It has a full set of bells that are rung regularly. Inside, the pews have doors at the end of each row which is unusual in this area. The village also has a further two churches - an Evangelical and a Methodist church; both are popular with social and youth clubs. The village is on the \\"old\\" road from Exeter to Tiverton and as such was once a busy thriving place. Now it has become a dormitory for people working in Exeter although there are still a number of original families living in the village. A post office, a small supermarket (Spar), butcher's shop and a hairdresser offer most necessities for the residents. The main feature of the village is the giant oak tree which is over 1,000 years old. The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Silverton railway station in 1867 but it has since closed. On the first Saturday of each August, the village holds a Street Market, which is popular among local people. There are stalls selling local goods and crafts, as well as entertainment and children's activities organised throughout the day, and the tug-of-war always ends the day on a high. Silverton is represented on Mid Devon District Council by Liberal Democratic Party Councillor Josh Wright (Village Ward) and by Independent Councillor Bob Deed (North Ward).  Silverton North Ward  Silverton Parish is divided into two wards; Village Ward to the south includes the village of Silverton together with the hamlets of Ellerhayes, Greenslinch, Hayne and Poundsland, and is home to around 95% of the population of the parish. In contrast, North Ward with a population of around 80, is almost entirely rural. Noted Devon historian William Hoskins claimed that Silverton North Ward was the location of Stochelie, a Domesday manor whose location had long been lost. If correct, North Ward would at one time have contained a small manor quite separate from Silverton. Until the 1990s the only settlements comprised a dozen or so working farms. Today most of these have been converted into small groups of dwellings including Underleigh, Dorweek, Ravenshayes and Leigh Barton. Bounded to the west by the small Burn river and to the north by the village of Butterleigh and lying on the slopes of the Hayridge Hills, North Ward affords tranquillity as well as stunning views of the Exe, Burn and Culm valleys.Silverton Parish Council  Silverton Parochial Trust  The Silverton Parochial Trust is a historic charity still operating in the Silverton area. It comprises a collection of 13 legacies, the earliest dating from 1616 and now formed into a modern charitable trust controlling property, land and investments.

The games are played from a third-person, top- down perspective, with the player taking the role of the games' young protagonist and main T-Fanger: Shigeki in Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang and Ky≈ç in Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2. One Denj≈´ stays by the player's side at a time and follows him around but in battle he can call up to two other Denj≈´ to help him. Denj≈´ will sometimes give the player their phone numbers after he or she beats them in a random battle but take longer to arrive in battle if they're originally from a distant area, due to getting lost. Sometimes, they may not even show up at all if called, so care must be taken to make sure that the player is not calling a Denj≈´ which is too far away. =Mechanics= All Denj≈´ have a range of statistics (colloquially called \\"stats\\"): Hit Points (HP), Speed, Attack, Defense, Denma Attack and Denma Defense. These statistics determine how powerful, fast or robust any given Denj≈´ is. The type of habitat a Denj≈´ lives in determines how weak it is to attacks from Denj≈´ from other habitats; there is a vulnerability chain that goes from Mountain to Sky, from Sky to Forest, from Forest to Aquatic, from Aquatic to Desert, from Desert to Grassland and, finally, from Grassland to Mountain. This also applies in reverse in the sense that a Denj≈´ of certain types inflicts less damage upon one it is weak to. However, this was slightly changed in Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2, where Denj≈´'s habitat types are defensive, and attacks are of separate offensive types: Normal, Flame, Thunder, Water, Wind, Rock and Machine. This arrangement makes Denj≈´ a bit more versatile, as they may carry moves that would be effective against opponents they would normally have trouble against. In battle, the Denj≈´ have an array of two to four attacks specific to their species. The battles are not strictly turn-based; the Speed stat of a Denj≈´ determines how many turns it can take and when. Thus, for example, a Denj≈´ with a higher Speed stat could attack twice for every time a Denj≈´ with a lower Speed stat goes once, also attacking before the slower Denj≈´ can get a hit in. Battles are performed in matches where each team may have anywhere from one to three Denj≈´ participating. Losing causes a game over and the player is then returned to the title screen of the games. A Denj≈´'s attacks cannot be altered unless a Denj≈´ evolves. Evolution is achieved by three different methods: \\"Natural evolution\\" (achieved by training Denj≈´), \\"Modified evolution\\" (by giving Denj≈´ certain items in a \\"modified evolution\\" area) or \\"Experimental evolution\\" (achieved by taking the DNA of one Denj≈´ with an item called Phone Card and giving it to the Denj≈´ to be \\"experimentally evolved\\"). Some Denj≈´ do not evolve. In Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang, evolution is permanent but in Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2, evolution can be reversed if it was not achieved through \\"Natural evolution\\". Many Denj≈´ have a special attack called Denma attack that needs to be charged up and takes multiple turns to execute. This special attack does damage based on the Denj≈´'s Denma Attack stat and is often considered not to be worth the wait. Due to the time that it takes for the special attack to charge, it is easy for the opponent to attack during multiple turns or to avoid the move entirely. In Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2, instead of having to wait for a Denma attack to charge, its use is limited by a DP meter. There are other attacks that can raise the Attack or Defense stat of a Denj≈´ or heal the user or its allies. These vary from Denj≈´ to Denj≈´. The use of items varies greatly between Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang and Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2. In Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang, items are only used for evolving Denj≈´ or gifts, excluding some items that are important to the storyline such as keys to unlock doors or a plush Denj≈´ toy that has been stolen. Evolution items are generally objects that come from the human world. These items are capable of affecting Denj≈´ in certain ways when they are forcibly combined. Such items range from simple objects like pencils and batteries to flamethrowers, computers, cranes and shuriken. Denj≈´ which evolve via \\"Modified evolution\\" will only do so if they receive a specific item. Certain items also give large amounts of experience points to Denj≈´ without evolving them. In Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2, evolution items are of the same type as Denj≈´ (Mountain, Sky, Forest, Aquatic, Desert or Grassland) and any such item can be used to evolve a Denj≈´ of the same type. However, different items may have certain effects on stat growth. Evolution items can also be thrown at enemy Denj≈´ to attempt to befriend them more easily and the probability of this occurring is increased if the item thrown matches their type. In addition to evolution items, there are also special items which can be held by Denj≈´ to boost one of their stats. Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2 also introduced items which can heal a Denj≈´'s HP and/or DP as well as cure status effects such as paralysis. Items can be purchased at shops or found in treasure chests but may also be picked up after battles or found by running through grass. Plot =Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang= The games take place in the year 2020 and there are special mobile phones equipped with a unique antenna called D-Shot which allows teleportation through \\"antenna trees\\". A 10-year-old boy named Shigeki finds one of these phones and is accidentally transported with another boy, Matsukiyo, to another world when he loses a baseball near an \\"antenna tree\\". This world is full of fantasy creatures called Denj≈´, who all own a D-Shot and use them to call their friends to help them compete in battles. These phone battles are also known as Telefang. Shigeki becomes a T-Fanger and travels the Denj≈´ world, trying to learn more about it. At the same time, he gets wrapped up in several plots involving evil Denj≈´ as well as other humans, who may or may not be T-Fangers. =Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2= The games follow the story of Ky≈ç, a blue-haired 10-year-old T-Fanger who travels to the Denj≈´ world to look for his missing father. His friend Midori accompanies him on the journey. During his adventure, he encounters a Denj≈´ named Diablos, who is killing off the \\"antenna trees\\" as he is not happy with the fact that humans are entering the Denj≈´ world. After Diablos kills all but one \\"antenna tree\\", that tree becomes the only gate between the two worlds. Ky≈ç has to prevent Diablos from killing that last \\"antenna tree\\", or Ky≈ç will be stuck in the Denj≈´ world forever.

First released as a monthly feature in the Comic BonBon magazine, the manga's issues were later reprinted as a set of three tank≈çbon, or volumes. A manga was also serialized by Kodansha for Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang 2; however, it was featured only in the Comic BonBon magazine and was never reprinted. Piracy Pok√©mon Diamond, the Power Version The first two Keitai Denj≈´ Telefang games received an unofficial English translation. The original games were not related to Nintendo's Pok√©mon series, but the translations were marketed as Pok√©mon Diamond and Pok√©mon Jade. The creatures used for the cover arts are neither Denjuu nor Pok√©mon; the box for Pok√©mon Jade depicts the forest spirit, Shishigami, from Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Princess Mononoke, while the box for Pok√©mon Diamond depicts a blue snake-like creature of unknown origin. The translations are notorious for their poorly translated English text as well as serious programming errors that can cause the game to crash.

Life Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek was born in the town of Vamberk, Bohemia, where his father was schoolmaster, choirmaster and organist. As a child prodigy, he started to perform publicly in Bohemian towns at the age of nine.Sleeve note of the CD (Supraphon, SU 3678-2001) His father taught him music, encouraged his playing the piano and helped him get a scholarship to attend the University of Prague, where he studied philosophy. He also had lessons in piano and composition from V√°clav Tom√°≈°ek. He found it impossible to obtain sufficient work as a musician in Prague, so in 1813 at the age of 22, Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek moved to Vienna to study law and, he hoped, to meet Beethoven. In Vienna he was able to greatly improve his piano technique under Johann Nepomuk Hummel, but once more failed to gain full-time employment as a musician. Although Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek was enthralled by the classical style of Mozart, he was more intrigued by the incipient romanticism of Beethoven. In 1814, as he was starting to compose, he did indeed meet Beethoven in Vienna. He also met other leading musicians there, including the composers Louis Spohr, Ignaz Moscheles, Hummel, and especially Franz Schubert with whom he became fast friends. He completed his law studies in 1821 and was appointed barrister to the Court Military Privy Councillor, for whom he mainly drafted legal documents. But in 1822, he at last found musical employment as second court organist and ended his legal career. He was appointed first organist in 1824. He soon won esteem as a composer of orchestral, vocal and piano music for orchestra. In 1818 he became conductor of the Friends of Music Society (Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde) of Vienna. Vori≈°ek died, in Vienna, of respiratory arrest in 1825 at the age of 34. He was buried at the common cemetery in W√§hring (today's W√§hringer Park). Music Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek wrote only one symphony, his Symphony in D major, in 1821. Its style has been likened to Beethoven's first two symphonies, but its melodically inventive early Romantic idiom was similar to Schubert's. In his capacity as imperial court organist, Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek composed a Mass in B-flat major. Together with his single symphony, some of his piano works and his Violin Sonata in G major, Op. 5, the Mass has been recorded. The first recorded use of impromptu as a musical term occurred in 1817, in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, an idea of the publisher to describe a piano piece by Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek . His Impromptus Op. 7 were published in 1822, pieces known to his friend Schubert who subsequently used the description for several sets of music for piano, as did Frederic Chopin and numerous other composers. In 1823-24, like Schubert, he was one of the 50 composers to contribute a variation on the same waltz by Anton Diabelli for the Vaterl√§ndischer K√ºnstlerverein on which Beethoven composed his 33 variations (Op. 120).

It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director- General. History ASI was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General. The first systematic research into the subcontinent's history was conducted by the Asiatic Society, which was founded by the British Indologist William Jones on 15 January 1784. Based in Calcutta, the society promoted the study of ancient Sanskrit and Persian texts and published an annual journal titled Asiatic Researches. Notable among its early members was Charles Wilkins who published the first English translation of the Bhagavad Gita in 1785 with the patronage of the then Governor-General of Bengal, Warren Hastings. However, the most important of the society's achievements was the decipherment of the Brahmi script by James Prinsep in 1837. This successful decipherment inaugurated the study of Indian palaeography. =Formation of the ASI= Sir Alexander Cunningham Armed with the knowledge of Brahmi, Alexander Cunningham, a prot√©g√© of James Prinsep, carried out a detailed survey of the Buddhist monuments which lasted for over half a century. Inspired by early amateur archaeologists like the Italian military officer, Jean-Baptiste Ventura, Cunningham excavated stupas along the width, the length and breadth of India. While Cunningham funded many of his early excavations himself, in the long run, he realised the need for a permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and the conservation of Indian monuments and used his stature and influence in India to lobby for an archaeological survey. While his attempt in 1848 did not meet with success, the Archaeological Survey of India was eventually formed in 1861 by a statute passed into law by Lord Canning with Cunningham as the first Archaeological Surveyor. The survey was suspended briefly between 1865 and 1871 due to lack of funds but restored by Lord Lawrence the then Viceroy of India. In 1871, the Survey was revived as a separate department and Cunningham was appointed as its first Director-General. =1885‚Äì1901= Cunningham retired in 1885 and was succeeded as Director General by James Burgess. Burgess launched a yearly journal The Indian Antiquary (1872) and an annual epigraphical publication Epigraphia Indica (1882) as a supplement to the Indian Antiquary. The post of Director General was permanently suspended in 1889 due to a funds crunch and was not restored until 1902. In the interim period, conservation work in the different circles was carried out by the superintendents of the individual circles. \\"Buck crisis\\" (1888-1898) Sir Edward Charles Buck (1838-1916), Civil servant in Bengal, India From 1888 started severe lobbying aimed at reducing Government expenses, and at curtailing the budget of the Archaeological Survey of India, a period of about ten years known as the \\"Buck crisis\\", after the Liberal Edward Buck. In effect, this severely threatened the employment of the employees of the ASI, such as Alois Anton F√ºhrer, who had just started a family and become a father. In 1892, Edward Buck announced that the Archaeological Survey of India would be shut down and all ASI staff would be dismissed by 1895, in order to generate savings for the Government's budget. It was understood that only a fantastic archaeological discovery within the next three years for example might be able to turn public opinion and save the funding of the ASI. Alois Anton F√ºhrer own report on his discoveries, entitled Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birthplace, 1897, was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. Great \\"discoveries\\" were indeed made with the March 1895 discovery of the Nigali Sagar inscription, which succeeded in bringing the \\"Buck Crisis\\" to an end, and the ASI was finally allowed in June 1895 to continue operations, subject to yearly approval based on successful digs every year. Georg B√ºhler, writing in July 1895 in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, continued to advocate for the preservation of the Archaeological Survey of India, and expressed that what was needed were \\"new authentic documents\\" from the pre-Ashokan period, and they would \\"only be found underground\\". Another momentous discovery would be made in 1896, with the Lumbini pillar inscription, a major inscription on a pillar of Ashoka discovered by Alois Anton F√ºhrer. The inscription, together with other evidence, confirmed Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha. The organization was rocked when F√ºhrer was unmasked in 1898, and was found to file fraudulous reports about his investigations. Confronted by Smith about his archaeological publications and his report to the Government, F√ºhrer was obliged to admit \\"that every statement in it [the report] was absolutely false.\\" Under official instructions from the Government of India, F√ºhrer was relieved of his positions, his papers seized and his offices inspected by Vincent Arthur Smith on 22 September 1898. Smith's report is given in the appendix to this article and is available here: . F√ºhrer had written in 1897 a monograph on his discoveries in Nigali Sagar and Lumbini, Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birth-place in the Nepalese tarai, which was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. F√ºhrer was dismissed and returned to Europe. =1901‚Äì1947= John Marshall The post of Director General was restored by Lord Curzon in 1902. Breaking with tradition, Curzon chose a 26-year-old professor of classical studies at Cambridge named John Marshall to head the survey. Marshall served as Director General for a quarter of a century and during his long tenure, he replenished and invigorated the survey whose activities were fast dwindling into insignificance. Marshall established the post of Government epigraphist and encouraged epigraphical studies. The most significant event of his tenure was, however, the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization at Harappa and Mohenjodaro in 1921. The success and scale of the discoveries made ensured that the progress made in Marshall's tenure would remain unmatched. Marshall was succeeded by Harold Hargreaves in 1928. Hargreaves was succeeded by Daya Ram Sahni. Sahni was succeeded by J. F. Blakiston and K. N. Dikshit both of whom had participated in the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro. In 1944, a British archaeologist and army officer, Mortimer Wheeler took over as Director General. Wheeler served as Director General till 1948 and during this period he excavated the Iron Age site of Arikamedu and the Stone age sites of Brahmagiri, Chandravalli and Maski in South India. Wheeler founded the journal Ancient India in 1946 and presided over the partitioning of ASI's assets during the Partition of India and helped establish an archaeological body for the newly formed Pakistan. =1947‚Äì2019= Wheeler was succeeded by N. P. Chakravarti in 1948. The National Museum was inaugurated in New Delhi on 15 August 1949 to house the artifacts displayed at the Indian Exhibition in the United Kingdom. Madho Sarup Vats and Amalananda Ghosh succeeded Chakravarti. Ghosh's tenure which lasted until 1968 is noted for the excavations of Indus Valley sites at Kalibangan, Lothal and Dholavira. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act was passed in 1958 bringing the archaeological survey under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture. Ghosh was succeeded by B.B. Lal who conducted archaeological excavations at Ayodhya to investigate whether a Ram Temple preceded the Babri Masjid. During Lal's tenure, the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (1972) was passed recommending central protection for monuments considered to be \\"of national importance\\". Lal was succeeded by M. N. Deshpande who served from 1972 to 1978 and B. K. Thapar who served from 1978 to 1981. On Thapar's retirement in 1981, archaeologist Debala Mitra was appointed to succeed him - she was the first woman Director General of the ASI. Mitra was succeeded by M. S. Nagaraja Rao, who had been transferred from the Karnataka State Department of Archaeology. Archaeologists J. P. Joshi and M. C. Joshi succeeded Rao. M. C. Joshi was the Director General when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992 triggering Hindu-Muslim violence all over India. As a fallout of the demolition, Joshi was dismissed in 1993 and controversially replaced as Director General by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Achala Moulik, a move which inaugurated a tradition of appointing bureaucrats of the IAS instead of archaeologists to head the survey. The tradition was finally brought to an end in 2010 when Gautam Sengupta an archaeologist, replaced K.M Srivastava an IAS officer as Director General.He was again succeeded by Pravin Srivastava, another IAS officer. Srivastava's successor and the present incumbent, Rakesh Tiwari is also a professional archaeologist. Organisation The Archaeological Survey of India is an attached office of the Ministry of Culture. Under the provisions of the AMASR Act of 1958, the ASI administers more than 3650 ancient monuments, archaeological sites and remains of national importance. These can include everything from temples, mosques, churches, tombs, and cemeteries to palaces, forts, step-wells, and rock-cut caves. The Survey also maintains ancient mounds and other similar sites which represent the remains of ancient habitation. The ASI is headed by a Director General who is assisted by an Additional Director General, two Joint Directors General, and 17 Directors. =Circles= The ASI is divided into a total of 30 circles each headed by a Superintending Archaeologist. Each of the circles are further divided into sub-circles. The circles of the ASI are: # Agra # Aizawl # Amravati # Aurangabad # Bengaluru # Bhopal # Bhubaneswar # Chandigarh # Chennai # Dehra Dun # Delhi # Dharwad # Goa # Guwahati # Hyderabad # Jaipur # Jodhpur # Kolkata # Lucknow # Mumbai # Nagpur # Patna # Raipur # Raiganj # Ranchi # Sarnath # Shimla # Srinagar # Thrissur # Vadodara The ASI also administers three \\"mini-circles\\" at Delhi, Leh and Hampi. =Directors-General= The Survey has had 29 Directors-General thus far. Its founder, Alexander Cunningham served as Archaeological Surveyor between 1861 and 1865. Museums India's first museum was established by the Asiatic Society in Calcutta in 1814. Much of its collection was passed on to the Indian Museum, which was established in the city in 1866. The Archaeological Survey did not maintain its own museums until the tenure of its third director-general, John Marshall. He initiated the establishment of various museums at Sarnath (1904), Agra (1906), Ajmer (1908), Delhi Fort (1909), Bijapur (1912), Nalanda (1917) and Sanchi (1919). The ASI's museums are customarily located right next to the sites that their inventories are associated with \\"so that they may be studied amid their natural surroundings and not lose focus by being transported\\". A dedicated Museums Branch was established in 1946 by Mortimer Wheeler, which now maintains a total of 50 museums spread across the country. Library The ASI maintains a Central Archaeological Library in the Archaeological Survey of India headquarters building in Tilak Marg, Mandi House, New Delhi. Established in 1902, its collection numbers more than 100,000 books and journals. The library is also a repository of rare books, plates, and original drawings. The Survey additionally maintains a library in each of its circles to cater to local academics and researchers. Publications The day-to-day work of the survey was published in a series of periodical bulletins and reports. The periodicals and archaeological series published by the ASI are: ;Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum : It consists of a series of seven volumes of inscriptions discovered and deciphered by archaeologists of the survey. Founded in 1877 by Alexander Cunningham, a final revised volume was published by E. Hultzsch in 1925. ;Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy : The first volume of the Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy was brought out by the epigraphist -E. Hultzsch in 1887. The bulletin has not been published since 2005. ;Epigraphia Indica : Epigraphia Indica was first published by the then Director-General, J. Burgess in 1888 as a supplementary to The Indian Antiquary. Since then, a total of 43 volumes have been published. The last volume was published in 1979. An Arabic and Persian supplement to the Epigraphia Indica was also published from 1907 to 1977. ;South Indian Inscriptions : The first volume of South Indian Inscriptions was edited by E. Hultzsch and published in 1890. A total of 27 volumes were published till 1990. The early volumes are the main source of historical information on the Pallavas, Cholas and Chalukyas. ;Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India : It was the primary bulletin of the ASI. The first annual report was published by John Marshall in 1902‚Äì03. The last volume was published in 1938‚Äì39. It was replaced by Indian Archaeology: A Review. ;Ancient India : The first volume of Ancient India was published in 1946 and edited by Sir Mortimer Wheeler as a bi-annual and converted to an annual in 1949. The twenty-second and last volume was published in 1966. ;Indian Archaeology: A Review : Indian Archaeology: A Review is the primary bulletin of the ASI and has been published since 1953‚Äì54. It replaced the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India. State government archaeological departments Apart from the ASI, archaeological work in India and conservation of monuments is also carried out in some states by state government archaeological departments. Most of these bodies were set up by the various princely states before independence. When these states were annexed to India after independence, the individual archaeological departments of these states were not integrated with the ASI.

The CAG could physically verify only 45% of the structures (1,655 out of 3,678). The CAG report said that the ASI did not have reliable information on the exact number of monuments under its protection. The CAG recommended that periodic inspection of each protected monument should be done by a suitably ranked officer. The Culture ministry accepted the proposal. Author and IIPM Director Arindam Chaudhuri said that since the ASI is unable to protect the country's museums and monuments so they should be professionally maintained by private companies or through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model. In May 2018, the Supreme Court of India said that the ASI was not properly discharging its duty in maintaining the World Heritage Site of Taj Mahal and asked the Government of India to consider whether some other agency be given the responsibility to protect and preserve it.

The city had previously sent such waste to New Jersey, but that state refused to accept any more after 1984. The company handling the waste (Joseph Paolino and Sons) subcontracted shipment to Amalgamated Shipping Corp and Coastal Carrier Inc, operators of Khian Sea. The latter intended to dump the ash in the Bahamas. However, the Bahamian government turned the ship away, and Philadelphia withheld payment to the companies because the waste was not disposed of. Over the next 16 months, Khian Sea searched all over the Atlantic for a place to dump its cargo. Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau and the Dutch Antilles refused. Its return to Philadelphia also failed. In January 1988, the crew finally dumped 4,000 tons of the waste near Gona√Øves in Haiti as \\"topsoil fertilizer\\". When Greenpeace informed the Haitian government of the origin of the waste, the Haitian commerce minister ordered the crew to reload the ash, but the ship slipped away. The Haitian government subsequently banned all waste imports. Local cleanup crews later buried some of the waste in a bunker inland, but the rest remained on the beach. Next the crew of Khian Sea tried to unload the rest of the cargo in Senegal, Morocco, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka and Singapore. After repairs in Yugoslavia, the ship's name changed to Felicia, and registered in Honduras. Later it was renamed Pelicano. These changes failed to hide the ship's original identity. The rest of the ash disappeared en route from Singapore to Sri Lanka in November 1988. The crew refused to comment but eventually the ship's captain admitted that they had dumped the remaining 10,000 tons of the waste into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1993, two owners of Coastal Carrier were convicted of perjury, having ordered the dumping. Over the years, various attempts to return the ash dumped in Haiti failed. In 1997, New York City Trade Waste Commission investigated Eastern Environmental Services whose owner was part of Joseph Paolino and Sons. They agreed to give the company a license to operate in New York City in condition that it would contribute to the cleanup in Haiti. Eastern Environmental Services agreed to take the waste back. Greenpeace and Haitian environmental groups launched a \\"Project Return to Sender\\" to lobby for funds. City of Philadelphia contributed $50,000. In April 2000, Waste Management Inc. in Haiti loaded 2,500 tons of ash and contaminated soil onto the barge Santa Lucia and shipped it to Florida, where the barge was docked in the St. Lucie Canal. It remained there until June 2002 when it was moved to Mountain View Reclamation Landfill, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania near Antrim Township, after several government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, had found the contents to be classified as nonhazardous waste. The case contributed to the creation of the Basel Convention about disposal of hazardous waste.

The first bridge at Batesford was built by the Corio and Bannockburn shire councils in 1846. Provided with a tollgate, the wooden bridge was located upstream from the ford, and collapsed in 1847. It was again rebuilt in wood in 1848, and was damaged by flood in 1852 and later repaired. A bluestone bridge was built in 1859, which still exists today as a service road.

The first wooden bridge was built downriver from the ford by the Shire of Corio and Shire of Bannockburn in 1854, and was tolled until 1877. It was in poor condition by 1898, with load restrictions being put into place. A new bridge was built nearby in 1900 by John Monash and J. T. N.

George Wombwell, (24 December 1777 at Dudnorend, near Saffron Walden - 16 November 1850 at Northallerton), was a famous menagerie exhibitor in Regency and early Victorian Britain. He founded Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie. Life and work George Wombwell's tomb, Highgate Cemetery George Wombwell was born in Wendon Lofts, Essex in 1777. Around 1800 he moved to London and in 1804 became a shoemaker in Soho. However, when a ship from South America brought two boas to London docks, he bought them for ¬£75 and began to exhibit them in taverns. He soon made a good profit. Wombwell began to buy exotic animals from ships that came from Africa, Australia and South America, and collected a whole menagerie and put them on display in Soho. In 1810 he founded the Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie and began to tour the fairs of Britain. By 1839 it totalled fifteen wagons, and was accompanied by a brass band. His travelling menagerie included elephants, giraffes, a gorilla, a hyena, kangaroo, leopards, 6 lions, llamas, monkeys, ocelots, onagers, ostriches, panthers, a rhino (\\"the real unicorn of scripture\\"), 3 tigers, wildcats and zebras. However, because many of the animals were from hotter climes, many of them died in the British climate. Sometimes Wombwell could profitably sell the body to a taxidermist or a medical school, other times he chose to exhibit the dead animal as a curiosity. Wombwell bred and raised many animals himself, including the first lion to be bred in captivity in Britain; he named it William in honour of William Wallace. In 1825 Warwick, Wombwell, in collaboration with Sam Wedgbury and dog dealer Ben White's assistant Bill George, arranged a Lion-baiting between his docile lion Nero and six bulldogs. Nero refused to fight but when Wombwell released Wiliam, he mauled the dogs and the fight was soon stopped. Over the years, Wombwell expanded three menageries that traveled around the country. Wombwell was a regular exhibitor at the annual Knott Mill Fair in Manchester, a venue he sometimes shared with Pablo Fanque's circus.Gretchen Holrook Gerzina, Editor, \\"Black Victorians- Black Victoriana\\" (Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, NJ, 2003) He was invited to the royal court on five occasions to exhibit his animals, three times before Queen Victoria. On one occasion Prince Albert summoned him to look at his dogs who kept dying and Wombwell quickly noticed that their water was poisoning them. When the prince asked what he could do in return for this favour, Wombwell said, \\"What can you give a man who has everything?\\" However, Wombwell requested some oak timber from the recently salvaged Royal George. From this he had a coffin fashioned for himself, which he then proceeded to exhibit for a special fee. Wombwell frequented Bartholomew Fair in London and even developed a rivalry with another exhibitor, Atkins. Once when he arrived at the fair, his elephant died and Atkins put up a sign \\"The Only Live Elephant in the Fair\\". Wombwell simply put up a scroll with the words \\"The Only Dead Elephant in the Fair\\" and explained that seeing a dead elephant was an even a rarer thing than a live one. The public, realising that they could see a living elephant at any time, flocked to see and poke the dead one. Throughout the fair Atkins' menagerie was largely deserted, much to his disgust. George Wombwell died in 1850 and was buried in his Royal George coffin in Highgate Cemetery, under a statue of his lion Nero. The book George Wombwell (1777 - 1850): Volume One recalls the lion and dog fight in Warwick with well researched evidence, but questions whether it ever actually took place. George Wombwell (1777 - 1850): Volume Two covers Wombwell's life as the most famous showman, from his arrival in London around 1800 to his death in 1850.Villiers Everett, Shaun, George Wombwell (1777 - 1850) Volume One: Events at Warwick (Wombwell Collection 2016) and George Wombwell (1777 - 1850)Volume Two: The World's Greatest Showman (Wombwell Collection 2017), which covers his life in London from 1800 to his eventual death in 1850. In 1851 a tapir broke out of its den at Wombwell's Menagerie in Rochdale, causing panic among the spectators.

Composition Te Rauparaha composed \\"Ka Mate\\" circa 1820 as a celebration of life over death after his lucky escape from pursuing NgƒÅti Maniapoto and Waikato enemies. He had hidden from them in a pƒÅtaka, a food- storage pit, and climbed back into the light to be met by a chief friendly to him ‚Äì Te Whareangi (the \\"hairy man\\"). The haka as composed by Te Rauparaha begins with a chant: Then follows the main body of the haka: \\"Ka Mate\\" was conceived as a brief energizing haka of the ngeri type, where, in the absence of set movements, the performers are free to extemporize their chanting and movement as they feel fit, without any need for synchronization.

Since 2005 the All Blacks have occasionally performed another haka, \\"Kapa o Pango\\". Since the introduction of \\"Kapa o Pango\\" the longest sequence of \\"Ka Mate\\" performances by the All Blacks is nine, which occurred between 22 August 2009 and 12 June 2010.

In 2006, the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand declined their claim on the grounds that \\"Ka Mate\\" had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader. In March 2011, New Zealand Rugby Union came to an amicable agreement with the iwi not to bring the mana of the haka into disrepute.

During those wars he was employed by The Times, and his eye-witness reports did much to alert western nations of war crimes committed by the Italians in Ethiopia and by the Germans in Spain, although little was done to prevent them by the League of Nations. He returned to Ethiopia after the world war started and helped the campaign defeat the Italians and restore Hailie Selassie to the throne. Early life George Steer was born in South Africa in 1909, the son of a newspaper manager. He studied classics in England, at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. He began his journalistic career in South Africa, then worked in London for the Yorkshire Post. War correspondent Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia In 1935 Steer covered the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, also known as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, for The Times. He reported that Italian forces made extensive use of poison gas in the form of mustard gas and also bombed Red Cross ambulances, despite clear markings of the red cross.Nicholas Rankin, 'Steer, George Lowther (1909‚Äì1944)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He was involved in helping to transport gas masks to Ethiopia to give at least some protection against the poison gases deployed illegally by the Italians. He became friendly with Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, who later became godfather to Steer's son. He met and married his first wife in Ethiopia, under difficult conditions in the British Legation in Addis Ababa, with looting and rifle fire outside the gates of the compound. His wife and his first child died in childbirth in London a little later. =Spanish civil war= Guernica In 1937 he was sent to report on the Spanish Civil War. His first reports from the Basque country described how British merchant ships beat the Nationalist blockade of Bilbao to bring food to the starving people of the town and surrounding region. He also visited the front line on several occasions to report directly on the fighting. He won prominence with his scoop report on the bombing of Guernica on 26 April 1937. His telegram to London described German bomb casings (inscribed with the words Rheindorf 1936, with the German eagle insignia), and the use of thermite as an incendiary to create a firestorm in the center of the town. High explosive bombs were used to create blast damage to wooden structures, which could then be ignited more easily by the incendiaries. His reporting did much to inspire Pablo Picasso to record the atrocity for posterity in his massive painting. It also alerted western governments to the way the Germans were preparing to use terror bombing as a way to intimidate civilians. His reports were directly contradicted by the Nationalists, who said that the damage was caused by the Government forces themselves, as they had at Ita earlier in the conflict, although a League of Nations investigation concluded that neither the terror bombing theory nor the Nationalist's version of intentional arson were accurateS.G Payne, The Spanish Civil War, 213. Steer responded to such reports by providing details of the damage in the town (such as bomb craters) and the Luftwaffe aircraft used in the attack, such as Heinkel He 111 bombers. Although he was not an eye-witness to the bombing itself, he arrived soon afterwards, and so was able to see the effects and talk to some of the survivors. He was one of the last journalists to leave Bilbao as the Nationalists advanced, and fled to Santander to the west. A tiled wall in Gernika claims \\"Guernica\\" Gernikara, \\"The Guernica (painting) to Gernika.\\" =Winter war in Finland= The anti-Fascist tone of Steer's reporting led The Times to dispense with his services; the newspaper's editorial stance on the war was anti-Republican, whilst its editor, Geoffrey Dawson, privately sympathised with the Nationalists under Francisco Franco. However the newspaper had a general policy of appeasement when it came to Germany, the Nazis and Fascism. Steer returned to South Africa and, in his book Judgment on German Africa, documented Germany's attempts to subvert its former African colonies, especially the Cameroon, South West Africa (now known as Namibia), Tanganyika and Togoland. Finnish ski troops in Northern Finland on 12 January 1940. Street signal in Bilbao (Spain). After the outbreak of World War II, the Daily Telegraph dispatched Steer to Finland to cover the Winter War, when Finland was attacked by the Soviet Union in November 1939. Steer saw the effects of aerial bombing of several Finnish towns by the Soviets, attempts made to intimidate the population, just like at Guernica. But by contrast with Ethiopia and Spain, western countries such as Britain and France (and nazi Germany) were only too eager to offer arms and equipment as well as volunteers to assist the Finns. The war was of relatively short duration owing to the disparity in armed might, although the Russian casualties were much greater than those of the Finns. An armistice was signed in March, 1940 and Finland lost about 10% of her territory to the Soviets. =Return to Ethiopia= When Italy declared war on Britain, plans were laid to invade Ethiopia from Kenya and the Sudan, with the aim of toppling the Italian regime and re-instating Hailie Selassie as Emperor. Steer was appointed as an officer in the Intelligence Corps of the British Army, initially to chaperone Selassie from London to the Sudan (under the pseudonym, \\"Mr Smith\\" since the position of the Emperor had to be kept secret from the Italians). He was then put in charge of a mobile propaganda unit to undermine the Italian garrisons by leafletting, loudspeaker attacks and so on. The campaign was remarkably successful, with many Italian troops deserting to become prisoners, and Ethiopians transferring allegiance. Steer broadcast light Italian operas and news from the Italian front in Libya, where the British army had great successes against much larger Italian forces in 1941. The military campaign waged by British and Ethiopian soldiers was very successful, using a combination of regular troops and irregular forces led by Orde Wingate. They entered Addis Ababa in triumph in April 1941 to accept the defeat of the Italians. Personal life In May 1936, as looters ravaged Addis Ababa around him, and while taking a break from rescue work, Steer married French newspaper correspondent Margarita Herrero. A short while afterwards he was deported by the Italian authorities, along with other Europeans, for aiding the opposition Abyssinians.Campagne d‚ÄôAbyssinie, 05/1936 from this page Margarita Steer died in childbirth in London while George Steer was reporting on the Spanish Civil War.

Military service and death In June 1940 Steer joined the British Army and led an Ethiopian Forward Propaganda unit when British troops began to fight Italian troops in the country.

He was successively promoted from Lieutenant to Captain, Major and finally, Lieutenant-colonel, and was attached to the Special Operations Executive. His work was appreciated and promoted by General Slim, the local army commander, who wanted to expand the operation. George Steer died in the crash of a heavily loaded Army Jeep, which he was driving, in Burma on 25 December 1944 on the way to a Christmas party.

Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it. This type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty is an immediate no-ball and, in Twenty20 and one-day matches, a free hit. The use of beamers is governed under Law 41.7. The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match), as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=3100831 Fast bowlers, particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques, are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers, albeit accidentally. A beamer may not necessarily be bowled with intent. It may be due to sweaty hands or a wet ball, causing a slipped release from the hand. It is also possible that the bowler attempts to bowl a yorker which goes askew.\\"What is a beamer in cricket? .. Why does it happen?\\", Shubham Khare, Sportskeeda A bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces, called a bouncer. These are easier to play or avoid than beamers. Abdur Rehman, a Pakistani spin bowler, bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh, and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legitimate ball, despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.

Life Abraham de la Pryme was born to French Huguenot parents, Matthias de la Pryme and Sarah Smague (or Smagge) at Hatfield in 1671. Despite his father's desire that he should attend the University of Glasgow and then become a Presbyterian minister, de la Pryme insisted on attending the University of Cambridge, becoming a pensioner of St John's College in 1690. Here de la Pryme devoted much of his time to natural history, chemistry, and magic before receiving his BA in 1693-1694. He became curate of Broughton but resigned in 1696 with intention of writing a history of Hatfield: In 1698 he was appointed curate of Holy Trinity Church, Hull, and in 1701 he was appointed by the Duke of Devonshire to the position of curate at Thorne. Whilst visiting the sick there he became ill and died in 1704. He was buried at Hatfield. De la Pryme began keeping a diary--Ephemeris Vitae: A Diary of My Own Life--at the age of twelve and continued it until his death. This diary was published by the Surtees Society in 1870. Whilst writing his history of Hatfield, de la Pryme began to correspond with Sir Hans Sloane and the antiquary Thomas Gale. Whilst at Hull he amassed material for a history of that city. Unfinished at his death, the two volume work was finally published in 1986. In 1701 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, having communicated with the Society on topics as varied as archaeology, natural history, and meteorology.

Part of a reef, normally a metre below sea level at high tide, was piled high with sand and a small stone platform was erected carrying the flag of the Republic of Minerva‚Äîa white torch on a blue background. The 'President of Minerva,' Morris Davis, declared at the time: \\"People will be free to do as they damn well please. Nothing will be illegal so long it does not infringe on the rights of others.

A Tongan expedition was sent to enforce the claim, arriving on 18 June 1972. The Flag of Tonga was raised on 19 June 1972 on North Minerva and on South Minerva on 21 June 1972. The Foundation's next attempt to establish a libertarian state was in 1973 on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. In the period approaching Bahamian independence, a number of white residents objected to living under black rule. In June 1973, one month before the intended independence, the Foundation financed Chuck Hall and Bert Williams' Abaco Independence Movement (AIM), which sought to make Abaco independent of the Bahamas.

He wrote poetry in Middle High German and was author of noted works about how knights and nobles may lead more virtuous lives. Ulrich was a member of a wealthy and influential ministerialis family from Liechtenstein in Styria. He was born about 1200 at Murau in the Duchy of Styria, located in the present- day country of Austria. Ulrich wrote his stories at a time when knightly ideals were just being promulgated from Western Europe. He outlines rules for knights, ministeriales, and free nobles to follow to lead honorable and courtly lives. There are several instances where he places the (unfree) ministerials and the free nobles in one category separate from the knights to point out the nobility of his own estate.Freed, pp. 263-5 Details of Ulrich's life are difficult to ascertain. Much of what scholars know relies heavily upon information gleaned from his often-fictional, self-styled autobiographical work the Frauendienst (trans. Service of Ladies). Separating fact from stylized hyperbole has proven difficult for historians.Freed, pp. 249-251  Life  From age 12 on, Ulrich received noble training as a page to a lady of much higher station than heFreed, p. 252 then another four years as a squire to Margrave Henry of Istria,Freed states that \\"The text (stanza 29) says Margrave Henry of Austria, but Heinrich of M≈ëdling was never styled a margrave. Some scholars have thus been inclined to identify Ulrich's teacher as Margrave Heinrich IV of Istria.\\" Freed, p. 252 n. 82. son of Duke Berthold IV of Merania, he was knighted by the Babenberg duke Leopold VI of Austria in 1222. Ulrich is documented as a Styrian Truchsess in 1244/45, from 1267 to 1272 Marshal and in year 1272 also a provincial judge. When Philip of Sponheim, the Archbishop-Elect of Salzburg, was deposed by Pope Alexander IV for refusing to take holy orders, Philip raised an army to defend his title. In 1250, Ulrich agreed to fight for Philip's cause in return for Philip's arranging a beneficial marriage of Ulrich's son, Ulrich II, to Kunigunde of Goldegg and Philip added a dowry of 400 Salzburg pounds to the agreement. In return Ulrich I agreed to provide Philip with 100 fighting men for his cause.Arnold, p. 105; Freed, p. 199 In August 1252 Philip's forces decisively defeated his enemies at the Battle of Sachsenburg on the Drava, and Ulrich was one of seven who mediated the ensuing peace.Freed, p. 200-1 Leader of the Styrian nobility, Ulrich had a hand in absorbing the duchy into the possessions of Rudolph of Habsburg after the ducal House of Babenberg had become extinct in 1246. It is possible that Ulrich was one of the noblemen taken prisoner by King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1269. He owned three castles, besides Liechtenstein another at Strechau near Lassing in the Enns ValleyFreed, p. 200 and the third at his birthplace Murau. When his son Ulrich II married, Ulrich bestowed upon the couple the castle of Murau along with twenty vassals and revenue.Arnold, p. 178, Freed, p. 263 Many aspects of his life are unrecorded, but some genealogy survives. He had a brother named Hartnid who served as Bishop of Gurk from 1283 to 1298Freed, p. 266 and a brother named Dietmar IV of Liechtenstein-Offenburg, who had a son named Gundaker.Freed, pp. 199-200 Besides Ulrich's son, Ulrich II, he had a daughter named Diemut (who married Wulfing of Trennstein), a son named Otto II and a son-in-law named Herrand II of Wildon by an unnamed daughter.Freed, p. 262 Ulrich died on 26 January 1275.Freed, p. 250 He was buried in Seckau in modern-day Austria.  Works  = Frauendienst = Ulrich is famous for his supposedly autobiographicalAlluded to in stanza 397, lines 1-4. Freed, p. 250 poetry collection Frauendienst (Service of the Lady). He writes of himself as a protagonist who does great deeds of honor to married noblewomen, following the conventions of chaste courtly love. The protagonist embarks on two remarkable quests. In the first quest, he travels from Venice to Vienna in the guise of Venus, the goddess of love. He competes in jousts and tourneys and challenges all the knights he meets to a duel in the honour of his lady. He breaks 307 lances and defeats all comers. The noblewoman, however, mostly spurns his affections and demands more deeds and even mutilation for even the honour to hold her hand. In the second quest, he takes on the role of King Arthur (\\"Artus\\"), with his followers becoming Arthurian Round Table characters. Regrettably, the first two pages of the beginning have been lost to time. The protagonist, Ulrich, wanders through Styria and Austria in the guise of King Arthur inviting all knights to \\"break lance\\" (that is, to joust) three times with him for honor's sake. In this disguise he attended many tournaments. The story illustrates how a worthy knight-errant was supposed to wander about defeating opponents in honorable combat. The story intersperses some songs and courtly advice to knights and some admonitions to greedy nobles and faithless squires.Freed, p. 254-5 The collection was finished in 1255. = Frauenbuch = Frauenbuch was a dialogue set in 1240, published in 1257, lamenting the decay of chivalric courtship.  Popular culture  The protagonist of the 2001 film A Knight's Tale, played by Heath Ledger, assumes the title Ulrich von Liechtenstein when he poses as a knight. Being undefeated in jousts, this was a worthy man's name to take. The name also proved to work well in the plot and provided the necessary contrast to the hero's true name, William Thatcher. However, the character claims to come from Gelderland, which was not in Styria but rather in the Low Countries.  Notes   Bibliography  * Arnold, Benjamin.

He, using the title Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtney, King of Jerusalem, along with several of his followers, was killed in a confrontation with soldiers in Bossenden Wood, in what has sometimes been called the last battle to be fought on English soil. Early life John Nichols Tom (or Thom) was born the son of innkeepers in 1799 at St Columb Major, Cornwall. He was baptised in the parish church on 10 November 1799. His parents were William and Charity Tom who kept the Joiners' Arms.Rogers: 1-2 Tom went to school in Penryn, attending Bellevue Academy (a \\"Classical and Commercial Academy\\"). At the age of about fourteen he transferred to the private school in Launceston that was run by Reverend Richard Cope, pastor of the local Congregational Church.Rogers: 2 Tom stayed at school until he was eighteen and was then articled to solicitor Mr Paynter of St Columb. He decided, however, against a career in the law and left after three years. After a short spell as an innkeeper in Wadebridge he settled down as a clerk in the firm of Lubbock and Co, wine merchants of Truro, and took over the business when the partners retired, extending it to include malting. In 1821 he married Catherine Fisher Fulpitt, the daughter of a market gardener in Truro.Rogers: 3 Tom was a tall, strongly built, good-looking man, who became known in Truro for his skill as a cricketer. During a visit to London he joined the Spencean Society.Rogers: 4 When Tom was in his late twenties a series of disasters struck. His mother Charity was removed to Cornwall Lunatic Asylum in 1827, and died there. Then, in 1828, his business premises in Pydar Street burnt down. Tom claimed the insurance and was able to rebuild the premises.Rogers: 5-6 At the Quarter Sessions held at Bodmin on 15 July 1828, Tom applied successfully for the return of ¬£304 paid in excise duty on malt destroyed in the fire at his malthouse on 17 June 1828.Cornwall Record Office, Sessions held at Bodmin QS/1/11/370-397 15 July 1828, abstract at National Archives online, QS/1/11/387: \\"Application by John Nicholls Tom of Truro, maltster, who stated that on 17 June last his malthouse in Truro contained 2,358 \\"Winchester bushels\\" [a standard weight] of malt, the duty on which he had paid ¬£304.11s.6d. His warehouse had been destroyed by fire together with the contents: Collector of Excise to allow John Nicholls Tom full amount of duty paid.\\" In 1831 Tom received treatment from a surgeon for an attack of insanity but recovered and the following spring sailed from Truro to Liverpool with a cargo of malt. He wrote to his wife from Liverpool to tell her he had sold the malt, and wrote again from Birmingham to tell her he was going to France. Nothing more was heard from him until over a year later, when his family heard that a man who fitted his description and went by the name of Sir William Courtenay was being held in Maidstone prison.Rogers: 7-8; Reay: 111. Canterbury In September 1832 Thom arrived in Canterbury, dressed in exotic costumes and wearing long hair and a beard. He put up at the Rose Inn at the junction of Rose Lane and the main street and went first by the name of Count Rothschild, and then by the name of Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, heir to the Earl of Devon and the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales.Rogers: 8-16 Although many people realized he was an imposter he nevertheless became a colourful and popular figure in the town, partly because he frequently made comical and insulting speeches directed at the unpopular mayor and magistrates of the city and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so strong that the Conservatives decided not to field candidates. Stung by jeers about not standing, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for Canterbury, hoping he would inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for Richard Watson and 802 for Viscount Fordwich, the Liberal candidates).Rogers: 20-24 He then decided to stand in the East Kent election, but polled only three votes, and turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, The Lion. Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament.Rogers: 32 Tom's biographer described the views expressed in The Lion as showing \\"amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time\\", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although these \\"occasional shafts of light\\" were surrounded by \\"turgid nonsense\\".Rogers: 40-41 Barming Heath At the beginning of March 1833, Thom intervened in the case of some Faversham smugglers, acting as a witness for the defence. The smugglers were nevertheless convicted, and Tom was prosecuted for perjury.Rogers: 40-45 His trial took place on 25 July at the Kent Summer Assizes at Maidstone before Mr Justice Parke and a crowded court. Evidence was heard from the Vicar of Boughton-under-Blean that Tom had been at church when he claimed to have witnessed events off the Goodwin Sands. In spite of the testimony of a number of character witnesses, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and Tom was sentenced to three months imprisonment and seven years transportation to Australia.Rogers: 57-67 Tom's family in Truro had heard about the trial and Catherine Tom arrived in Maidstone in August to see if Courtenay was her missing husband. He was produced by the governor of Maidstone Gaol and she made a positive identification. Although Tom always denied any connection with the Truro family, Catherine Tom was believed. She told the authorities about her husband's previous attack of insanity; he was then examined by two surgeons who declared him of unsound mind. Tom was transferred to Barming Heath Asylum on 28 October 1833.Rogers: 69-71 Tom was a model patient in the asylum and in 1837 the superintendent suggested to his wife that she should petition the home secretary for his release. Tom's father in Truro brought his son's case to the attention of Sir Hussey Vivian, the Liberal candidate for East Cornwall in the August 1837 election. Vivian, after his election, took the matter up with the home secretary, Lord John Russell, and Tom was granted a free pardon by Queen Victoria, on condition he was returned into the care of his family in Cornwall.Rogers: 74-80 Thom was still refusing to acknowledge the Cornish family and, instead of returning to Cornwall, went to live with a local farmer and supporter, Mr Francis of Fairbrook, Boughton-under-Blean, who had offered to be his guardian. This was permitted, due to some ambiguous wording on the pardon, and in October 1837, four years after his admission to the asylum, Tom was released.Rogers: 81 Battle and death Plaque in Hernhill churchyard By January 1838, Tom had fallen out with Mr Francis, and he spent the next few months riding through East Kent, relying on the hospitality of supporters.Rogers: 89 With promises of a better future, fairer distribution of wealth and greater equality, he attracted a following of agricultural labourers, artisans and small-holders. In particular, he addressed their concerns about low wages, lack of work, and the New Poor Law, which ordered all able-bodied men to workhouses if they could not find work.J. Lowerson, ed. Charlesworth, An Atlas of Rural protests in Britain, 1548-1900 (1983), pp. 139-141: \\"The 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act was designed specifically to cope with the severe problems of rural England and to prevent... a repetition of the 1830s incidents in the epicentres of Kent... There, complex soil patterns, small-scale farming and low investment rates combined with a rapid population surge to produce... dependence on permanent relief of 25% of population... groups of labourers (1835) ...besieged local magistrates in the workhouse... 37 labourers were imprisoned for... up to two years.\\" Until the end of May, the activities of Tom and his small band of followers were entirely peaceful as they marched around the local countryside trying to drum up support amongst the workers. Some wealthier landowners were however becoming alarmed and, on 31 May 1838, a local magistrate, Dr Poore, issued a warrant for Tom's arrest for inciting workmen to leave their work.Rogers: 93-110 Early on the morning of 31 May, the parish constable of Boughton-under-Blean enlisted the help of his assistant and also of his brother, Nicholas Mears, and set off to find Tom. When they arrived at Bossenden Farm, where Tom and his followers were staying, Tom shot and killed Nicholas Mears. The constable and his assistant fled.Rogers: 110-112 News of the murder reached the magistrates and soldiers were called out from the barracks at Canterbury. A detachment of the 45th Infantry under Major Armstrong, with three junior officers and about one hundred men, met up with the magistrates and tracked Tom and his followers down to a clearing in Bossenden Wood. Tom's followers numbered between thirty and forty (a few having managed to escape after the killing of the constable), and, with the exception of Tom and one other who had pistols, were armed only with sticks. As the soldiers advanced, Lieutenant Bennet was shot dead by Tom. In the ensuing confrontation, which lasted only a few minutes, Tom and eight of his followers were killed or mortally wounded by the soldiers, and a young special constable who was helping the soldiers was caught in their fire and killed. One soldier was slightly injured by a stick.Rogers: 128-130 Aftermath and legacy Tom's body, together with those of his followers who had been killed, was taken to the Red Lion Inn at Dunkirk.Rogers: 139 The inn was besieged by souvenir and relic hunters, and the simply curious. The landlord of Red Lion claimed 20,000 people had visited the neighbourhood over the next few days.Reay: 155 Tom's biographer describes public feeling: > \\"This was an insignificant casualty list as battles go; but it was a > terrible price to pay for the capture, dead, of one man. When the disastrous > results of the affray became known, public opinion was deeply shocked at > what seemed an unnecessary loss of life. The repercussions of the Battle of > Bossenden wood were soon, in fact, to reach Westminster itself.\\"Rogers: 137 An inquest was held at the White Horse, Boughton, the Saturday after the battle, with the jury returning a verdict of \\"justifiable homicide\\" on the deaths of Tom and his followers.Rogers: 152-153 On the following Tuesday Tom was buried in Hernhill cemetery.Rogers: 154-157 Few of Tom's followers had been arrested at the scene of the battle, but some were picked up over the next few days.Reay: 153 Thirty men and two women were arrested, and of these ten were tried for murder - two for the murder of the constable's brother and nine for the murder of Bennett (with Thomas Mears being charged with both).Reay: 159 Thomas Mears and William Price were convicted of the murder of the constable's brother, then the rest pleaded guilty. Thomas Mears and William Wills were transported for life, William Price for ten years, and the others received one year's imprisonment.Reay: 161-164 Local magistrates and politicians, especially Lord John Russell, were attacked for their role in the affair. There were accusations that Sir Hussey Vivian had requested Tom's release in return for his father's vote. A parliamentary select committee was appointed and sat for three days in June.Rogers: 170-178 Barrister Frederick Liardet was sent to survey the area for the Central Society of Education, and a school and a church were built in Dunkirk. Journalists talked of the ignorance and moral degradation of the area. Feargus O'Connor suggested a monument should be erected in memory of Courtenay's followers.Reay: 152  References  Bibliography * B Reay 1990 The last rising of the agricultural labourers: rural life and protest in nineteenth-century England.

The chain suffered from mismanagement and declared bankruptcy; as the government had acquired the forfeited company, it was incorporated into the state-owned restaurant chain SARA. As Carrols, Clock used the McDonald's concept with names for hamburgers such as 'Big Clock' ('Big Mac'). Using a huge clock as its logo, the chain grew to be very successful and widespread during the 1970s and 1980s, even branching out to China, but got into economic problems in the 1990s and started closing or selling restaurants. In 1996 Clock actually sold six restaurants (four in Stockholm and two in Gothenburg) to McDonald's. The same year, as part of what turned out to be a new business strategy, the company bought the hotel and restaurant company Provobis, which had the same main owner, Rolf Lundstr√∂m, who thereby consolidated his holdings. It also attempted to reduce its own ownership in restaurants and increase the number of franchise restaurants, but by 1998 only 14 Clock restaurants remained, of which six were sold the same year and the remaining eight at the beginning of 1999. The company took the name Provobis, and was in 2000 bought by the large Scandic Hotels corporation. McDonald's continued to expand in Sweden during this period (as did other American chains such as Burger King and Pizza Hut), but in an interview in 1996 the CEO of Clock explained the problems of his company with the increasing competition from other types of fast food such as kebab and sandwiches.

It is a supporting ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with the primary focus of organizing volunteers to build churches and schools in developing nations. History In 1969 under the direction of John Freeman a commercial photographer, a group of Seventh-day Adventist volunteers flew to the Bahamas to build a church This idea expanded to other projects involving volunteers flying their private planes to locations to build churches and was organized into Maranatha Flights International based in Berrien Springs, Michigan. In 1989 Maranatha Flights International merged with Volunteers International under the new name of Maranatha Volunteers International and moved the headquarters to Sacramento, California. More recently, the headquarters were moved to the neighboring city of Roseville, California. In its 40-year history more than 60,000 volunteers have built churches, schools, orphanages, hospitals and community buildings in 67 countries. Maranatha has requests for 100,000 buildings pending. Volunteers An average of 3,000 volunteers participate in projects each year. The majority of the volunteers are from the United States and Canada but participants come from all over the world. They generally pay for their transportation as well as a participation fee which covers meals, lodging, in-country transportation and insurance while on the project. Most projects are approximately two weeks duration. The funding for the buildings is primarily furnished by Maranatha via donors as well as participation by Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries (ASI). The local church provides the land and final labor and materials. Projects are classified into categories such as teen, young adult, open, group or family depending on the volunteer makeup. While the teen Ultimate Workout and young adult groups which are age limited, other projects have widely varying age volunteers. A number of volunteers participate in multiple trips, often on an annual basis. Not all volunteers are skilled in the construction trades. In addition to actual building construction, some volunteers are typically involved in cooking and some may participate in community projects such as Vacation Bible School or medical and dental clinics. Active projects Maranatha concentrates their building activities in certain countries which change from time to time. In 2010 Maranatha is building primarily in Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Zambia and the United States. In 2009, 507 churches were built of which 428 of the structures were \\"One-Day Churches\\" built in 25 countries. =Haiti= In 2010 Maranatha provided assistance to Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake. 140 \\"One- Day Churches\\" are currently being built in Haiti to be used as churches, schools, medical triage and temporary shelters. =One-Day Church= Volunteers building a One-Day Church in Bebedero, Chiapas, Mexico January 2010 The One-Day Church was developed jointly by Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries and Maranatha in an effort to meet the demand for rapid economical construction of more buildings. The galvanized steel frame and roof of the church are manufactured at a facility in Dodge Center, Minnesota, containerized and shipped on-site where it is assembled by volunteers and local personnel in one day. The walls and floors are built of local materials and vary according to local practices. Floors are most often poured concrete. As of March 2009 over 1,000 structures had been manufactured and as of July 2010 more than 800 had been constructed in 10 countries. =One-Day School= In June 2010 Maranatha introduced the One-Day School project at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists session in Atlanta, Georgia. This project is an extension of the One-Day Church idea providing a metal frame, roof, walls, doors and windows. The project launch involves 1,000 classrooms with the first One-Day School to be built in Zimbabwe. =Ultimate Workout= The Ultimate Workout is a volunteer two-week mission program for high school age teenagers. These projects are generally in Latin America and may involve up to 200 volunteers. In July 2010 the Ultimate Workout project celebrated its 20-year anniversary with a reunion project in Chiapas, Mexico. Publications Maranatha has a quarterly magazine named The Volunteer that is mailed to volunteers and donors. Maranatha Mission Stories Since 2003 Maranatha has produced a 30-minute television program named Maranatha Mission Stories which documents various building projects.

Marthe Hanau (1890‚Äì1935) was a Frenchwoman who successfully defrauded French financial markets in the 1920s and 1930s. Early life Marthe Hanau was born in Lille to the family of a Jewish industrialist. She married and later divorced Lazare Bloch. In 1925, she and Bloch (they remained business partners after the divorce) founded an economic newspaper, La Gazette du Franc et des Nations.\\"Justice Is Rotten\\", TIME Magazine, 4 June 1934 issue Hanau used the newspaper to dispense stock tips to financial speculators. Fraud Hanau's paper promoted mainly the stocks and securities of her own business partners, whose businesses were mere shells or paper companies. Still, the value of their stock kept rising when stockbrokers bought and traded them. Hanau expanded her investing advice network and later formed her own financial news agency, Agence Interpresse. She even released short-term bonds that promised 8% interest. Now, French banks and Agence Havas, the rival financial news agency, turned against her. Banks began to investigate the nonexistent companies and soon, there were numerous rumors about Hanau's shady business practices. At first, Hanau managed to quell the rumors by bribing cooperative politicians. However, when charges continued to swirl around her, police arrested Hanau, Bloch and many of their business partners on 17 December 1928. They were charged with fraud and confined in St. Lazare prison. By then, her investors had lost approximately 120,000,000 contemporary French francs. The preliminary trial began 15 months later. Hanau protested that the court did not understand financial business, that she could return all the money and that she should be released on bail. When court denied the bail, she went on a hunger strike. Three weeks later, Hanau was moved to the h√¥pital Cochin in Paris, where she was forcibly fed. When she was left alone, she made a rope out of bedsheets, climbed out of the window and returned to St. Lazare prison. Police chief Jean Chiappe, a Corsican, was afraid that she would die in his hands and requested for her to be released on bail. She was moved to a hospice, where she still announced that she would return all the money, but not everybody believed her. Her trial began in earnest on 20 February 1932. During the trial, Hanau revealed the names of all the politicians that she had bribed and caused a scandal. Hanau received two years in prison, but the court credited her with the 15 months she had already spent in prison. Bloch received 18 months, and their other partners were released with fines. When Hanau was released later that year, she bought the Forces magazine. In April 1932, she published an article about the shady side of the financial markets and quoted a S√ªret√© file about herself. Police arrested her but she refused to reveal who had leaked the file, just that it had been taken from the Financial Minister Flandin. She was sentenced to 3 months in prison for receiving classified information.The TIME Magazine article indicates that the three-month sentenced was for contempt of court after had she declared that \\"Justice Is Rotten\\" and that she would loudly say so whenever she was brought before a court. She appealed, but when the appeal was rejected, she fled. She was soon arrested and returned to prison. Death Marthe Hanau committed suicide on 19 July 1935 by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Legacy A French movie, \\"La Banqui√®re\\" (The Lady Banker), by Francis Girod, was made in 1980, starring Romy Schneider as \\"Emma Eckhert\\", a thinly fictionalized Hanau.

Carey currently serves as the Assistant Director of the USA National Team. High School years Carey attended Horizon High School in Thornton, Colorado. She graduated as class valedictorian with a 4.0 GPA. She was named Colorado's Gatorade Player of the Year and a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 1999 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored three points. College years In 1999, Carey attended Stanford University, where she earned the Pac-10 Conference \\"Freshman of the Year\\" honors and broke Stanford's single season record for three pointers made with 81. However, she suffered several serious ankle injuries and concussions and spent much of the season on the sidelines. She had surgery on her left ankle following the season and missed the following six months with rehab. She came back to practice in October 1999, but could not continue as continuing pain in her ankle left her sidelined shortly after the start of the season. She was forced to retire from the sport and sat out the next two seasons. She was seen on her crutches cheering on her team on the bench and became a fan favorite. She continued to attend classes at Stanford, and was seen on campus limping on her crutches with her left ankle wrapped in a soft cast. She reportedly said her crutches were her best friends because she could not go anywhere without her crutches. A picture of her leaning on her crutches with an ice pack on her left ankle became the cover page of the Stanford women's basketball media guide in 2000, under the title \\"Courage\\". She transferred to The University of Texas at Austin in 2002 after the school's doctors determined they could clear her from her concussions and maintain any treatment she would need. She played three seasons there after successfully petitioning for a fifth and sixth year of NCAA eligibility. During her time at Texas, the team became a national championship contender with a Final Four appearance in 2003. She was a sociology major. USA Basketball Carey was named to the team representing the USA at the 2003 Pan American Games.

Two years later, Avery was elected as national corresponding secretary of that body, an office which she has held thereafter, with the exception of two years. At age 21, she attended the 11th convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association and became actively involved in its work, planning and organizing more than a dozen of the association's meetings across the country in 1880 and 1881. Susan B. Anthony and Rachel Foster Avery (l-r) NAWSA check payable to Avery, written by their treasurer Harriet Taylor Upton and signed by Susan B. Anthony and Alice Stone Blackwell. In 1882, she led the Nebraska campaign for an amendment to permit women to vote. Later, she disseminated throughout the state of Pennsylvania some 20,000 copies of a lecture by Governor John Hoyt of Wyoming, entitled \\"The Good Results of Thirteen Years' Experience of Women's Voting in Wyoming\\". In 1883, Foster traveled through Europe with \\"Aunt Susan\\", as she called Susan B. Anthony. They traveled through France, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. In February 1888, Foster organized the International Council of Women in Washington, D. C., held under the auspices of the National Woman Suffrage Association. A major undertaking, the council draw in delegates from more than 50 different organizations from seven countries. In the same year, a few months after the great International Council of Women, of which Avery was the secretary, she married Cyrus Miller Avery, whose mother, Rosa Miller Avery, was a well-known advocate of equal suffrage, serving it especially as a writer. Mr. Avery and his wife are equally strong in their advocacy of equal suffrage for men and women, and their idea of equal duties and equal rights was carried out in their home life. Foster later held the office of corresponding secretary of the National Woman Suffrage Association, of the National Council of Women, and of the International Council of Women. Personal life In 1887, she adopted a baby girl, whom she named Miriam Alice Foster. On November 8, 1888, Foster married Cyrus Miller Avery (1854-1919), whom she had met when he was a delegate to the International Council of Women meeting earlier the same year. Their marriage was jointly performed by a male pastor, Charles G. Ames of the Unitarian Church, and a female pastor, Anna Howard Shaw, one of the first women to be ordained a Methodist minister in the United States. In addition to Miriam, the couple had two more children, Rose Foster Avery and Julia Foster Avery.

Bagby was the first pitcher to hit a home run in a modern World Series, and one of the last three pitchers to win over 30 games in one season (31‚Äì12 in 1920). Biography A native of Barnett, Georgia, Bagby began his playing career with the Cincinnati Reds in 1912. His pitching records that year were not impressive, so the Reds let him go. He returned to major league baseball with the Cleveland Indians in 1916. Bagby posted 23 wins in 1917, following with 17 wins the next two campaigns. The 1920 Indians team was powered with stars such as Tris Speaker, Stan Coveleski and Ray Caldwell, and minor-league call-up Duster Mails, Charlie Jamieson, Elmer Smith and Bagby. On September 2 of that year, Bagby won his 31st game of the season, defeating the Tigers 10‚Äì1 in a game that clinched the American League pennant for the Indians. Since that game was played, only three other pitchers have collected 30 victories in one season: Dizzy Dean, Lefty Grove and Denny McLain. On October 10, Bagby's turn to make World Series history came in Game 5. It was a game filled with World Series firsts, as Elmer Smith became the first player in the Series history to hit a grand slam in the game's first inning. During the game's fourth inning, Bagby came to bat with two men on bases, hitting the first home run by a pitcher in modern World Series history. The following inning, another of Bagby's teammates, Bill Wambsganss, turned in the first unassisted triple play in World Series history. In 1921, it was Bagby's pitch that Babe Ruth hit as his record-breaking 120th home run. Before the 1923 season Bagby was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He retired at the end of the season. In a nine-season career, Bagby posted a 127‚Äì89 record with 450 strikeouts and a 3.11 ERA in 1821.2 innings pitched. In World Series play, he had a 1‚Äì1 record with an ERA of 1.80. Bagby was a good hitting pitcher in the majors, posting a .218 batting average (144-for-660) with 69 runs, 35 doubles, 6 triples, 2 home runs, 60 RBI and drawing 32 bases on balls. Baseball historians Bill James and Rob Neyer have ranked Bagby's screwball the ninth-best of all time. His son, Jim Bagby Jr., was also a major leaguer who played for the Red Sox, Indians and Pirates. The Bagbys became the first father and son to pitch in the World Series when Jim Jr. appeared for the 1946 Red Sox. Jim Bagby died in Marietta, Georgia at age 64. He was survived by his son Jim Jr. and two daughters, Mabel Moore and Elizabeth (Betty) Fincher.

In most modern engines, the crankcase is integrated into the engine block. Two-stroke engines typically use a crankcase-compression design, resulting in the fuel/air mixture passing through the crankcase before entering the cylinder(s). This design of the engine does not include an oil sump in the crankcase. Four- stroke engines typically have an oil sump at the bottom of the crankcase and the majority of the engine's oil is held within the crankcase. The fuel/air mixture does not pass through the crankcase in a four-stroke engine, however a small amount of exhaust gasses often enter as \\"blow-by\\" from the combustion chamber. The crankcase often forms the lower half of the main bearing journals (with the bearing caps forming the other half), although in some engines the crankcase completely surrounds the main bearing journals. An open-crank engine has no crankcase. This design was used in early engines and remains in use in some large diesel engines, such as used in ships.  Two-stroke engines  Two-stroke crankcase-compression engine = Crankcase-compression = Many two-stroke engines use a crankcase-compression design, where a partial vacuum draws the fuel/air mixture into the engine as the piston moves upwards. Then as the piston travels downward, the inlet port is uncovered and the compressed fuel/air mixture is pushed from the crankcase into the combustion chamber. Crankcase-compression designs are often used in small petrol (gasoline) engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. This design has also been used in some small diesel engines, however it is less common. Both sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a pump. Therefore an inlet valve is not required. Unlike other types of engines, there is no supply of oil to the crankcase, because it handles the fuel/air mixture. Instead, two-stroke oil is mixed with the fuel used by the engine and burned in the combustion chamber. = Lubricating crankcase = Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression, but instead a separate scavenge blower or supercharger to draw the fuel/air mixture into the compression chamber. Therefore the crankcases are similar to a four-stroke engine in that they are solely used for lubrication purposes.  Four-stroke engines  Four-stroke engine- oil shown in yellow at the bottom Most four-stroke engines use a crankcase that contains the engine's lubricating oil, as either a wet sump system or the less common dry sump system. Unlike a two-stroke (crankcase-compression) engine, the crankcase in a four-stroke engine is not used for the fuel/air mixture. = Oil circulation = Engine oil is recirculated around a four-stroke engine (rather than burning it as happens in a two-stroke engine) and much of this occurs within the crankcase. Oil is stored either at the bottom of the crankcase (in a wet sump engine) or in a separate reservoir (in a dry sump system). From here the oil is pressurized by an oil pump (and usually passes through an oil filter) before it is squirted into the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and onto the cylinder walls, and eventually drips off into the bottom of the crankcase. Even in a wet sump system, the crankshaft has minimal contact with the sump oil. Otherwise, the high-speed rotation of the crankshaft would cause the oil to froth, making it difficult for the oil pump to move the oil, which can starve the engine of lubrication. Oil from the sump may splash onto the crankshaft due to g-forces or bumpy roads, which is referred to as windage. = Ventilation of combustion gasses = Although the piston rings are intended to seal the combustion chamber from the crankcase, it is normal for some combustion gases to escape around the piston rings and enter the crankcase. This phenomenon is known as blow-by. If these gases accumulated within the crankcase, it would cause unwanted pressurisation of the crankcase, contamination of the oil and rust from condensation. To prevent this, modern engines use a crankcase ventilation system to expel the combustion gases from the crankcase. In most cases, the gases are passed through to the intake manifold.  Open-crank engines  Gardner 0 stationary engine (a plate acts as a safety shield, however the crankshaft is not fully enclosed). Early engines were of the \\"open-crank\\" style, that is, there was no enclosed crankcase. The crankshaft and associated parts were open to the environment. This made for a messy environment, as oil spray from the moving parts was not contained. Another disadvantage was that dirt and dust could get on moving engine parts, causing excessive wear and possible malfunction of the engine. Frequent cleaning of the engine was required to keep it in normal working order. Some two-stroke diesel engines, such as the large slow-speed engines used in ships, have the crankcase as a separate space from the cylinders, or as an open crank. The spaces between the crosshead piston and the crankshaft, may be largely open for maintenance access.

US Navy Vessels The original designation for the ships was LCS(L)(3), which stood for \\"Landing Craft Support (Large) Mark 3\\". In 1949 the class was reclassified to \\"Landing Ship Support, Large\\" (LSSL). The United States Navy had to have the designation LCS(L) because there was also a smaller class named LCL, that were built mainly for rescue and smoke laying during amphibious operation.\\"Rocket Boats Lay Smoke Screen For Landings. Popular Mechanics, February 1945, p. 28. Design and manufacture Builders progress photo of LCS(L)(3)-26, Commercial Iron Works, Portland Oregon, 21 July 1944. A total of 130 were made. Three different ship building yards did the construction: George Lawley & Son (Neponset, Massachusetts); Commercial Iron Works (Portland, Oregon); and Albina Engine Works (Portland, Oregon). The hull was the same as the Landing Craft Infantry ships. They were long, displaced , wide and drew when fully loaded. The flat bottom and skegs between and on either side of the twin screws allowed the ships to safely beach. The anchor is at the stern of the ship so it can be used to help pull the ship off the beach if necessary. The twin variable pitch screws were each driven by a bank of four Grey Marine (later General Motors) diesel engines, with a total power for all eight engines of . These engines gave a maximum speed of , but normally the ships sailed at . The ships had a range of . Armour for the gun mounts, pilot house and conning tower was provided by STS splinter shields. The ships had a smoke generator which was used to obscure landing craft approaching the beach. LCS(L) vessels could be produced in as little as 10 days, and final fitting out would take a further few weeks. The ships also made very good fire fighting ships. A fire fighting manifold was fitted in front of the bow gun and two monitors with pumps fitted just forward of the aft gun. =Armament= The LCS(L)(3) ships provided more firepower per ton than any ship ever built for the USN. Three guns and ten rocket launchers comprised the main armament. The bow gun was a 3\\"/50 caliber gun, a single 40 mm gun or a twin 40 mm gun. The forward and aft deck guns were twin 40 mm guns. The ten Mark 7 rocket launchers were situated behind the bow gun and forward deck house. Four 20 mm cannons were also mounted. Operations A group of LSSLs awaiting transfer to the ROK Navy in 1952 The Battle of Tarawa showed a gap in Navy resources for close in support of landing troops. The time interval between the end of shelling from the large ships and the arrival of the landing craft on the beach allowed the defenders to regroup. The Landing Craft Support was designed to fill this void. The first Landing Craft Support ships arrived in the Pacific Theater in time for the landings at Iwo Jima. After providing close in support during the landings at Okinawa, many Landing Craft Support ships were placed on the radar picket stations as anti- aircraft platforms. When not on a picket stations, the ship would create smoke to hide the fleet at anchor and perform \\"skunk patrol\\" screening for suicide boats. In the Borneo Campaign, Landing Craft Support was used in landings in Tarakan and Balikpapan. During World War II, five LCS(L)(3)s were sunk in combat (see below) and 21 were damaged. Three of these small warships received Presidential Unit Citations, while six were awarded Navy Unit citations. Importantly, Lieutenant Richard M. McCool, skipper of USS LCS(L)(3) 122, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. LCS(L)(3)-7, LCS(L)(3)-26 and LCS(L)(3)-49 were sunk by suicide boats off Mariveles, Corregidor Channel, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 16 February 1945. LCS(L)(3)-15 was sunk by kamikaze aircraft off Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, on 22 April 1945. LCS(L)(3)-33 was sunk by shore batteries off Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, on 19 February 1945. Post war At the end of the war, surviving ships returned to the United States. Some were restored to action for the Korean War. Many were transferred to Japan, France (and on to South Vietnam), Cambodia, Thailand, Greece, and other nations. Only two ships are known to still exist. One has been highly modified as a fishing boat. The second was in Thailand and was kept in very similar configuration to its original (HTMS Nakha, formerly USS LCS(L)-102). The National Association of USS LCS(L) 1-130 was successful in having HTMS Nakha transferred to the association for public display in the United States. She was officially released from the Royal Thai Navy on November 10, 2007 after being returned to the US in September of that year. As of May 2017 USS LCS(L)-102 is under restoration and upkeep.

They are widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Description Species of Indigofera are mostly shrubs, though some are small trees or herbaceous perennials or annuals. Most have pinnate leaves. Racemes of flowers grow in the leaf axils, in hues of red, but there are a few white- and yellow-flowered species. The fruit is a legume pod of varying size and shape. Indigofera is a varied genus that has shown unique characteristics making it an interesting candidate as a potential perennial crop. Specifically, there is diverse variation among species with a number of unique characteristics. Some examples of this diversity include differences in pericarp thickness, fruit type, and flowering morphology. The unique characteristics it has displayed include potential for mixed smallholder systems with at least one other species and a resilience that allows for constant nitrogen update despite varying conditions. One example of its unique flowering morphology is an open carpel not often seen elsewhere. In addition, it appears that the organ primordial is often formed at deeper layers than other eudicots. This variety could have significant implications on its role in an actual perennial polyculture. For example, different flowering morphologies could be artificially selected for in varying directions in order to better fit in different environmental conditions and with different populations of other plants. The types of fruit produced by different species of Indigofera can also be divided into broad categories that again show great variation. The three basic types of fruit categories can be separated by their curvature including straight, slightly curved, and falcate (sickle-shaped). In addition, several of the species including Indigofera microcarpa, Indigofera suffruticosa, and Indigofera enneaphylla have shown delayed dehiscence (maturing) of fruits This variation could again allow for artificial selection of the most abundant and nutritious fruit types and shapes. Another way to categorize Indigofera is by its pericarp thickness. The pericarp (the tissue from the ovary that surrounds the seeds) can be categorized as type I, type II, and type III with type I having the thinnest pericarp and fewest layers of schlerenchymatous (stiff) tissue and type III having the thickest pericarp and most schlerenchymatous layers. Despite the previous examples of delayed dehiscence, most fruits of this genus show normal explosive dehiscence to disperse seeds. Similar to fruit shape, the variation in fruit sizes allows for the thickest and most bountiful fruits to be selected. Uses =Indigo dye= Several species, especially Indigofera tinctoria and Indigofera suffruticosa, are used to produce the dye indigo. Scraps of Indigo-dyed fabric likely dyed with plants from the genus Indigofera discovered at Huaca Prieta predate Egyptian indigo-dyed fabrics by more than 1,500 years. Colonial planters in the Caribbean grew indigo and transplanted its cultivation when they settled in the colony of South Carolina and North Carolina where people of the Tuscarora confederacy adopted the dyeing process for head wraps and clothing. Exports of the crop did not expand until the mid-to late 18th century. When Eliza Lucas Pinckney and enslaved Africans successfully cultivated new strains near Charleston it became the second most important cash crop in the colony (after rice) before the American Revolution. It comprised more than one-third of all exports in value. The chemical aniline, from which many important dyes are derived, was first synthesized from Indigofera suffruticosa (syn. Indigofera anil, whence the name aniline). In Indonesia, the Sundanese use Indigofera tinctoria (known locally as tarum or nila) as dye for batik. Marco Polo was the first to report on the preparation of indigo in India. Indigo was quite often used in European easel painting during the Middle Ages. =Health and medicine= Several species of this group are used to alleviate pain. The herbs are generally regarded as an analgesic with anti-inflammatory activity, rather than an anodyne. Indigofera articulata (Khedaish in Arabic) was used for toothache, and Indigofera oblongifolia (hasr in Arabic) was used as an anti-inflammatory for insect stings, snakebites, and swellings. Indigofera suffruticosa and Indigofera aspalthoides have also been used as anti-inflammatories. A patent was granted for use of Indigofera arrecta extract to relieve ulcer pain. The Maasai people of Kenya use parts of Indigofera brevicalyx and Indigofera swaziensis as toothbrushes.

However many smaller groups remain today which attempt to mimic societies of the past. The membership of these societies is largely adolescent. Despite fading from contemporary Singaporean society, these secret societies hold great relevance to Singapore's modern history. The founding of the city-state in 1819 saw the arrival of thousands of Chinese, thereby transplanting to Singapore social systems already present in China itself. Although the secret societies were commonly associated with violence, extortion and vice, they also played a part in building a social fabric for early Chinese migrants in Singapore. They were given leeway to control the Chinese populace due to the hands-off policy adopted by the British colonials, who hoped to create stability. History The secret societies formed in Singapore can be traced to mid-18th century Fujian province in China, with the local offshoots adopting an organisational structure mirroring the parent organisation. The Hongmen, the first secret society to be established in Singapore, traced its origins to the Tiandihui in Fujian. Policing secret societies Despite their founding principles of mutual assistance and bonding, secret societies have, over time, come to conjure up impressions of violence and disorder. This association, perhaps exaggerated, has been encouraged by law enforcement officers since their formation in the colonial era. This perception was strengthened by several factors, including the inability of the colony's administration to control their activities, the branding of arrested society members as \\"criminal gangsters\\" by the media and an upsurge in violent crime in the 1960s sparked by a few society members. These factors came together during the same period in which the country was trying to gain a foothold fresh from having attained political independence it did not foresee. Several important riots in Malayan history had prompted the colonial government to respond umambiguously. These riots include the Penang Riots of 1867 (which involved the Ghee Hin) and the Post Office Riots of 1876. The Societies Ordinance of 1889 was introduced as an attempt at suppression.  Reasons for the decline  In the early 19th century, secret societies posed a significant threat to law and order in Singapore. The early Chinese immigrants' clandestine activities and occasional turf wars proved too much of a problem for the British authorities. The British authorities were therefore obliged to curb the growing problem. They employed a number of methods, both on purpose and not, to check the growth of secret societies. This resulted in the decline of secret societies. = Singapore becoming a Crown Colony = The transfer of authority over Singapore from the Indian Government to the colonial office in London is considered by most to be the most important factor that helped the British authority check the growth of secret societies. Elevation of Singapore to a Crown Colony meant that London was willing to spend money and resources, and provide proper administrators that it had been unprepared to do. Thus, Singapore was given a significantly larger priority and only with the transfer of power, could the authorities initiate the following changes. = Legislation of strict laws= The legislation of strict laws had an enormous effect in checking the growth of the secret societies. Two significant laws were passed in the 1860s. The first was the Peace Preservation Act (also known as the banishment act) of 1867, which gave the colonial government the power to detain and deport Chinese immigrants who were convicted of crime. This was a major weapon against the secret societies members as it created fear and deterred the immigrants from joining the secret societies. With this law, the power of the secret societies was significantly curtailed. In 1869, the Peace Preservation Act was amended, and the Dangerous Societies Suppression Ordinance was also enacted. This required that secret societies be registered. By requiring only the societies, and not the individual members, to be registered, the police attracted people to go to provide insight on the actual strength of the societies. 10 societies, 618 office bearers and 12371 members were registered in the first round of registrations. This ordinance also accorded the colonial government the power to inspect any society that was deemed dangerous to public peace. This way the colonial government could monitor the activities of the secret societies closely. This prevented the Chinese immigrants from joining the secret societies, causing it to reduce in influence in Singapore in the 19th century. = Improvements to police force = In 1843, there were only 133 police personnel. Even if the army of 595 men was brought in, they were still no match for the Chinese community consisting of 32 132 people (most of whom were secret society members). Thomas Dunman, the first Commissioner of Police, wrote that his police force was underpaid and drew salaries lower than the average coolies. By 1865, there were 385 policemen to 50,043 Chinese, but the ratio of policemen to Chinese was still too few to be effective. This was compounded by the fact that no one in the police force was qualified to deal with the Chinese. The officers' posts were held by Europeans while Indians made up the rank and file. No Chinese were employed because of their possible dealings with secret societies. Thus, the police force was ignorant of the language and ways of the Chinese, which was also the most volatile community. So ineffective was the police force that the wealthy had to hire private watchmen and carry personal arms to ensure their own safety. However, after Singapore became a Crown Colony, large improvements made to the local police force. This was an important factor that helped check the growth of secret societies. The police force started to receive more funding, better equipment and proper training. All these made the police force a much more effective force than it had been under the East India Company. Even more significant was the hiring of Chinese police officers who could understand and deal with the problems associated with the secret societies. =Establishment of Chinese Protectorate= The establishment of the Chinese Protectorate is yet another factor that led to the societies' growth being checked. The first Chinese Protector, William Pickering, maintained close contact with the Chinese immigrant community and provided them with assistance. Being fluent in written and spoken Mandarin as well as in other varieties of Chinese, Pickering looked after the welfare of the newly arrived coolies, prevented coolie abuse and kept track of the numbers of coolies leaving and arriving. Pickering also licensed coolie depots. To qualify for a licence, the depots required a constant and plentiful supply of water and good ventilation. He also visited the coolies to ask them in person what their connections in Singapore were, making sure they had someone to turn to during their stay. This establishment of the Chinese Protectorate let the British sustain, for the first time in history, a satisfactory relationship with the Chinese community. Pickering was known affectionately as daren (Â§ß‰∫∫), Chinese for 'Sir'. The Protectorate effectively became a legitimate alternative where migrants could come and try solve their problems, instead of putting it forward to the societies for a normally violent conclusion. It thus helped to deter many new immigrants from increasing the membership of secret societies.

Located on the coast of the Ionian Sea, the village has a long history of maritime activity. Aci Trezza is a popular spot for Italian vacationers in the summer. The patron Saint of the town is St. John the Baptist. The Festa of San Giovanni is celebrated each year during the last week of June in his honor. The Islands of the Cyclops Off the coast of Aci Trezza are three tall, prominent sea stacks. According to local legend, these were the great stones thrown at Odysseus in the epic poem The Odyssey by the monster Cyclops. The islands are thus referred to as the \\"isole dei ciclopi\\" (islands of the Cyclops, or Cyclopean Isles) by locals. This complements the notion that the Cyclops once had a smithy below Mount Etna, which looms over the village to the northwest. Cultural references Giovanni Verga's novel I Malavoglia (\\"The House by the Medlar Tree\\") is set in Aci Trezza. In 1948 Luchino Visconti filmed his neo-realist film La terra trema, based on Verga's novel I Malavoglia, in Aci Trezza. The entire cast were local inhabitants rather than professional actors. A small museum dedicated to the film can be found in the town, and is run by one of the cast members.

In 1948, they went to S.G. Warburg for financial backing for two new companies, Independent Film Distributors, and a production arm, Romulus Films. According to critic Ronald Bergan, \\"Their aims were ambitious: to produce artistically valuable and yet commercially viable films, whose subjects would be wider than the Little Englanderism of British pictures of the period, and featuring big stars.\\"Ronald Bergan Obituary: Sir John Woolf, The Guardian, 1 July 1999 accessed 2 June 2012 An obituarist of James Woolf stated that John \\"was the main financial brain and James primarily in charge of artistic policy.\\"\\"Mr. J.

The American director-producer Albert Lewin had begun to prepare the film for MGM, but the studio had cancelled the project, James Woolf discovered on a Hollywood visit, because of Lewin's problems with the House Un-American Activities Committee. According to John, this resulted in the Woolf's concentration on developing transatlantic projects. Their mentor, Alexander Korda, advised against half-financing The African Queen (1951): \\"Two old people going up and down an African river . . . who's going to be interested in that? You'll be bankrupt!\\". Korda was proved wrong. From this John Huston film they gained international critical and financial success. Two further films directed by Huston followed, Moulin Rouge (1952) and Beat the Devil (1953), but were less successful. Romulus became one of the most significant English production companies of the time. They made several films with producer Daniel Angel and helped turn Laurence Harvey, who they had under contract, into a star. In the mid-50s they formed a partnership with Korda, helping him to finance his films including Richard III (1955).

In 1963, the Woolf brothers ran into trouble from the film distributors Defence Organisation due to their refusal to withhold the rights to their old cinema films from the sale to television and there was some talk that their new films would be boycotted by British cinemas. This did not happen. =Later career= By now the brothers were working separately. James went to Hollywood to produce King Rat. Shortly afterwards he was staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel when he failed to keep a dinner arrangement with director Lewis Gilbert about making a film version of the musical Oliver!. A hotel employee found him dead, sitting up in bed with an open book on his lap; the cause was reported to be a heart attack. He was 46 years old.Associated Press \\"James Woolf, 46, British Producer: On Coast to Discuss Movie Plans, Executive Dies\\", New York Times, 31 May 1966: 43. Bryan Forbes later claimed the heart attack was brought on by an accidental overdose of painkillers. Gilbert had to pull out of the Oliver! project shortly before filming began because of his Paramount contract and John Woolf remembered The Fallen Idol (1948) which suggested to him that its director, Sir Carol Reed, had the requisite skills to work with children. John continued his career as a producer. In 1968 he bought British and American Film Holdings from Minster Trust. That year he produced his first film on his own, Oliver!, which ended up winning the Oscar for Best Picture. John Woolf was knighted in 1975 and remained a director of Anglia Television until 1983.

It is native to Australia and in the past considered as a game bird for hunting. Population estimate is 25 000 - 1 000 000. Other names include banded, black-breasted, brown flock and plain plover. Various views and plumages Image:Banded Lapwing Rottnest.jpg Adult on Rottnest Island File:Vanellus_tricolor_juvenile_- _Gretna.jpgJuvenile Image:Banded Lapwing.ogvAtkinson's Dam, SE Queensland, Australia Image:Banded_Lapwing,_Rottnest_Island.JPGRottnest Island, Western Australia  Taxonomy  Lapwings belong to the family Charadriidae (plovers) and sub-family Vanellinae. Biochemical evidence suggests that plovers are holophyletic, meaning that all modern plovers, and no other taxa, share the same common ancestor. It has been suggested that most plovers originated from the Southern Hemisphere and evolved under arid and semi-arid conditions. There are 25 extant species of lapwings. Africa has the most species of lapwings, while North America has none. Australia has two native species, the masked lapwing and the banded lapwing. The masked lapwing is split into Vanellus miles miles and Vanellus miles novaehollandiae.Vanellus miles (Boddaert, 1783) at ITIS The first fossils of the Vanellus species were from Belgian deposits retrieved from the middle Oligocene dating back 30 million years ago, the time when the first grasses appeared.  Description  The banded lapwing is a medium-sized shorebird with short dark purplish legs and a dull red tibia. They range from 25 cm to 29 cm in length and weigh on average 190 grams.Banded Lapwing at Australian 'Birds in Backyards' website They have an upright stance and a slow walk, breaking into a faster trot when alarmed. The bill is a pale yellow with a black tip and a small red wattle lies at the base. The red wattle and wing spurs are more prominent in males than females. Banded lapwings are characterised by a black cap, a white throat and underparts, white eye stripes and a black breast band extending up each side of its neck to its face. The irises are bright yellow. They fly quick, clipped wing beats, giving them the name 'lapwing'. The young range from 22 cm to 25.5 cm in length and weigh between 124-133 grams. Juvenile plumage is similar to that of the adults, however the crown, nape, sides of neck and breast is mottled dark brown and the feathers of the upper parts are tan.  Distribution and habitat  Banded lapwings are endemic to Australia and found throughout the mainland and Tasmania. They are rarely found in northern Australia and are uncommon in most coastal areas and they are not dependent on wetlands and may live far away from water. Banded lapwings prefer open plains and short grassland areas such as heavily grazed paddocks, agricultural lands and recently germinated cereal crops most commonly found inland and pastures of coastal and inland regions. It avoids Acacia scrub areas, except where these have become more open due to overgrazing. The species has probably benefited from the clearing of forest and woodlands in southern Australia for agriculture. Outside the breeding season, banded lapwings gather in small flocks and are nomadic. Its movements from one area to another is influenced by seasonal conditions. Records from the Atlas of Victorian Birds state the banded lapwing is most frequently reported in Victoria during Spring and Winter suggesting that in Victoria they breed when rainfall is highest.  Feeding  All plovers are obligate feeders and routinely forage during the day and at night. They prefer areas with very short grass to feed on seeds, insects including worms, ants, termites, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets and caterpillars.  Breeding  The movement of the banded lapwing whilst breeding is almost exclusively inland and away from wetlands banded lapwings are monogamous and breeds usually once a year throughout its normal distribution range. The breeding season is from June to November however, they may nest any month in dry inland areas following rain. It will usually nest in an open area well away from trees or scrub where the sitting bird has a wide uninterrupted view of its surroundings. Nests are a scrape or depression on the ground usually lined up with vegetation and sometimes small stones, twigs or animal droppings. The incubation period is 26 to 28 days and the care for the young is biparental. The eggs and chicks are well camouflaged. Eggs are usually in a clutch size of three to four eggs, light brown with brown and blackish-brown splotches all over the shell. Eggs are approximately 42 mm x 32 mm and pear shaped. During breeding season they are aggressive defending their territory and attacking any predator that comes close to the nests. The wing spurs are used in combat. Chicks will freeze up and remain quite still at sign of danger. Parents will distract intruders often by distraction displays and aggression. They lure the intruder away or protesting loudly, making loud swoops at the observer. They have a loud strident 'kew-kew-kew' call when alarmed or a descending 'er-chill-char, er-chill char' sound. The young can fly between three and four weeks. Reasons for nesting failure include trampling by stock, destruction of nests by vehicles and excessive human disturbance.  Conservation  Conservation of banded lapwings will be dependent on appropriate management of farm and pastoral lands as it exploits a variety of open habitats and agricultural land however, there are no immediate or serious threats to its future survival.

It was directed by Brian Gibson and stars Demi Moore as a single mother picked for jury duty for a mafia trial and Alec Baldwin as a mobster sent to intimidate her. The film received highly negative reviews and was a box office bomb, grossing only $22.7 million against its $44 million budget. Moore won a joint Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for both her performance in this film and in Striptease. Plot Annie Laird (Demi Moore) is a sculptor who lives in New York with her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon- Levitt); she works a day job as a data entry clerk. Annie is selected to be a juror in the trial of mob boss Louie Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco), who is accused of ordering the murder of Salvatore Riggio. Mark Cordell (Alec Baldwin) buys some of Annie's artwork and then wines and dines her before she discovers he is better known as \\"The Teacher\\", Boffano's enforcer and the actual perpetrator of Riggio's murder. Mark tells Annie to persuade the jury to acquit Boffano, or she and Oliver will die. A frightened Annie convinces the jury to acquit Boffano. After the trial, Boffano questions whether Annie should \\"disappear\\", seeing her as a loose end. Mark convinces Boffano otherwise. Mark goes after Annie's friend Juliet (Anne Heche). After having sex with her, Mark reveals himself to be Annie's stalker. He pulls a gun and forces Juliet to take a fatal drug overdose. Mark boasts of Juliet's murder to Eddie (James Gandolfini), who also works for Boffano but unlike Mark, is sympathetic to Annie as he is a parent himself. To ensure her son's safety, Annie hides Oliver in the village of T'ui Cuch, Guatemala. The prosecutor, who figured out Annie was threatened, wants Annie to turn state's witness so they can go after Mark, who now plans to take over Boffano's empire. Annie convinces the prosecutor to let her wear a wire in a scheduled meeting with Mark. Annie removes the wire and gives it to Eddie, insinuating she and Mark are now a couple. Annie then succeeds in getting Mark to incriminate himself in a boastful rant about his ambitions, which she tapes on a hidden tape recorder. She uses the tape to tip off Boffano, who schedules a meeting with Mark. Boffano's plan backfires when Mark kills both Boffano and his son Joseph (Michael Rispoli), along with their henchmen. He also slashes Eddie's throat. Mark, furious at Annie's betrayal, calls her, revealing his intention to travel to Guatemala to kill Oliver. Annie travels to Guatemala where there is a showdown with Mark. He chases Oliver into a structure, where locals shoot Mark. Annie, also armed with a pistol, fires six more shots, making sure Mark is dead after he tries to shoot Annie with a gun pulled from his ankle holster. Oliver is unharmed.

The Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) known as July or PKWN Manifesto () was a political manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, a Soviet-backed administration, which operated in opposition to the London-based Polish government in exile. It was officially proclaimed in Che≈Çm on 22 July 1944, and shortly after, its text was personally amended by Joseph Stalin in Moscow, before being printed there as well. Printing in Poland was staged for the media by the Soviets. The manifesto was addressed to the Polish nation at that time: individuals both within Nazi-occupied Poland, and those in exile abroad due to the ongoing World War II. It was arranged into thirteen main points. Among and within these points: * It declares the legitimacy of the coming State National Council, a Soviet-backed administration composed of populists, democrats, socialists, communists and other organisations. It then denounces the London- based Polish government in exile, the one ousted by the Nazi-Soviet military takeover at the outbreak of World War II. * It condemns the Polish Constitution of 1935 as unlawful and fascist and claims the Constitution of 1921 is the only current legal constitution. The State National Council will operate on the 1921 Constitution, until a new one can be written by new Sejm legislators in future direct, popular, free, elections by secret ballot. * It urges support of the Polish people for the People's Army and the Red Army, by capturing and turning in weapons, ammunition and supplies, and providing any intelligence or information, and doing their part in the fight against Germany. * It acknowledges that for 400 years there has been sustained, mutually-detrimental conflict between Poles and the Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, but their alliance, common cause and side-by-side fighting in the war should solidify a lasting strong, friendly, mutually-beneficial alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union. * It calls for negotiation of the Polish-Soviet and Polish-Czechoslovak borders to be reached by mutual agreement. * It calls for continued alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States, based on blood shed against a common enemy, and also maintaining Poland's traditional alliance with France and continued co- operation with the democratic countries of the world. It states that going forward, Polish government policy will be democratic and based on collective security. * Reparations will be demanded from Germany for Polish losses. * It claims for PKWN authority to extend to all liberated Polish territory, and asks Polish patriots in areas where the PKWN does not exercise authority to democratically elect members to participate in the PKWN. * It calls for the creation of a new police force, the Citizen's Militia, as a solution to lack of order caused by the removal of the Polish Police of the General Government, the so-called Blue Police. * It promises that German war criminals and Polish traitors will receive quick justice in independent courts. * It offers promise of restoration of democratic freedoms, equality of all citizens without distinction of race, religion, or nationality, freedom of political organisations, unions, press and conscience. Fascist organisations will be repressed to fullest extent of the law. * Property stolen by the Germans will be returned to individual citizens, institutions, and the church. German assets will be confiscated. National assets reclaimed from the German Reich and individual German capitalists will be put under the Interim National Management Board. * To speed up national reconstruction, broad land reform will be enacted in liberated territories. * Minimum wages will be raised, and a social security will be instituted, based on the principal of democratic self-government * Free, universal, compulsory education, and the Polish intelligentsia will be rebuilt. * Steps will be taken to encourage and organise immigration to Poland, but the borders will be closed to National Socialist agents and organisers of the 1939 invasion of Poland. * It places an appeal to national unity, without which it would be impossible to accomplish the monumental task of liberating Poland, winning the war, acquiring a dignified place for Poland among the nations of the world and rebuilding a destroyed country. * It urges the Polish people to do everything possible to liberate the country and defeat the Germans. The manifesto ends with a call to arms: \\"To the fight! To arms! Long live the united Polish Army, fighting for the freedom of Poland! Long live the allied Red Army, carrying out the liberation of Poland! Long live our great allies - the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the United States of America! Long live national unity! Long live the State National Council - the representation of the fighting people!

Piano Concerto No. 3 in C major, Op. 26, is a piano concerto by Sergei Prokofiev. It was completed in 1921 using sketches first started in 1913. Composition and performances Prokofiev began his work on the concerto as early as 1913 when he wrote a theme with variations which he then set aside. Although he revisited the sketches in 1916‚Äì17, he did not fully devote himself to the project until 1921 when he was spending the summer in Brittany. Prokofiev himself played the solo part at the premiere on 16 December 1921 in Chicago with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Frederick Stock. The work did not gain immediate popularity and had to wait until 1922 to be confirmed in the 20th century canon, after Serge Koussevitzky conducted a lavishly praised performance in Paris. The first Soviet performance was on 22 March 1925, by Samuil Feinberg, with the Orchestra of the Theatre of the Revolution under Konstantin Saradzhev.Music Web International Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo piano and orchestra with the following instrumentation. ;Woodwind: :2 Flutes (2nd doubling Piccolo) :2 Oboes :2 Clarinets :2 Bassoons ;Brass: :4 Horns :2 Trumpets :3 Trombones ;Percussion: :Timpani :Bass drum :Cymbals :Castanets :Tambourine ;Strings: :Violins :Violas :Cellos :Double Basses Analysis The concerto consists of three movements of roughly equal length which last just under 30 minutes in total. Of the five piano concertos written by Prokofiev, the third piano concerto has garnered the greatest popularity and critical acclaim. The concerto radiates a crisp vitality that testifies to Prokofiev's inventive prowess in punctuating lyrical passages with witty dissonances, while maintaining a balanced partnership between the soloist and orchestra. Unlike the examples of piano concertos set by many of Prokofiev's Romantic forebears, the orchestra rises above subsidiary accompaniment to play a very active part in this work. =I. Andante ‚Äì Allegro= The first movement opens with an andante clarinet solo, a long, lyrical melody that the whole orchestra eventually picks up and expands. The strings begin the allegro section with a scalar passage which seems to accelerate towards an upwards glissando climax, at which point the allegro entry of the solo piano unexpectedly breaks the lyrical mood in an exuberant, harmonically fluid burst of brilliance and rhythm, utilizing fragments of the first theme. Piano and orchestra continue in dialogue until the piano introduces the harmonic structure for the second theme with a loud, unexpected march-like climax. The second theme, considerably more dissonant and ambiguous in tonality, is first taken by the orchestra, then expanded upon by the soloist. This leads into what is perhaps the most recognizable pianistic feat of the first movement: several lines of octaves interspersed with close tones either above or below (in a triplet rhythm), moving up and down the keyboard with the hands usually on top of one another. This is followed by a restatement of the opening clarinet theme, played loudly in the full orchestra, which transitions to a haunting variation of the theme by the solo piano. A quick, scalar passage from the movement's beginning is now taken up by the piano, in what is arguably the most difficult passage in the first movement for its challenges of fingering and phrasing. This leads into an exact recapitulation of the piano's entrance, which now leads into a brilliant coda involving various figurations of the octave-triplet idea, as well as runs on the piano consisting entirely of ascending parallel triads and glissandi. The second theme is restated in the high register of the piano, first as blocked chords, then as frenetic sixteenth-note arpeggios. Several non-melodic scales allow the music to wind down to a quiet throb in the orchestra on a dissonant chord, C-A‚ô≠-D. The orchestra then resumes the pulsating low Cs; the piano makes a shortened restatement of the scalar passage that led to the recapitulation, which is now used to end the movement, with a dissonant harmony followed sarcastically by barely tonal open C octaves. =II. Tema con variazioni= The middle movement (in E minor) is a theme and five variations and is a dazzling example of Prokofiev expressing his slightly sarcastic wit in musical terms. * The central idea is stated by the orchestra in a hesitant, piquant gavotte. * The first variation is a broad, slow restatement by the piano, beginning with a long trill followed by a glissando-like run up the keyboard, in florid anticipation of the solo clarinet run at the beginning of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue written later in 1924. * The second variation is presented by the orchestra at a galloping pace, with the piano providing excitement with long runs up and down the keyboard. * The third variation is a heavily syncopated deconstruction of the main theme with a lumbering jazzy backbeat. * The fourth variation, possibly the most famous, is a haunting, wandering meditation of the main theme, with free dialogue between the piano and orchestra; a recurring motif of cold, ethereal falling thirds from the piano adds to the faintly other-worldly mood set by this section. * The fifth variation is another allegro romp for soloist and orchestra, starting in a sunny major key but modulating into transitional waters as the main theme is fragmented and thrown into double-time pieces, then building and subsiding into the * Coda. The orchestra plays the main theme in its original form, at original speed (one-half that of the preceding variation), with the piano providing double-time obbligato accompaniment. * A short andante ending hinting at an E-major ending gives the piano the last word with a low-octave E-minor chord. =III. Allegro, ma non troppo= The third movement, which Prokofiev himself called an \\"argument\\" between soloist and orchestra, begins with an A-minor statement of the main theme in bassoons and pizzicato strings, interrupted by the piano's assertive entrance with a conflicting theme. Interplay between the piano and orchestra builds up steam, with a brief quickening of tempo (foreshadowing the lengthy Coda) before arriving at a slow, lyrical secondary theme (C‚ôØ major/minor) in woodwinds. The piano offers a rather sarcastic reply, and the slow theme develops, through another Rachmaninoff-esque restatement and another ethereal exploration (the soloist running up and down the keyboard softly over gently dissonant muted woodwinds), into a united climax with piano and strings in unison, then fading into the Coda. This is the most virtuosic section of the concerto, with an allegro restatement of the main theme, again in bassoons, but in E minor. The piano reframes it initially in D major, then slides into a bitonal obbligato against a G major underpinning in strings. Then the coda explodes into a musical battle between soloist and orchestra, with prominent piano ornamentation over the orchestra (including famously difficult double-note arpeggi, sometimes approximated by pianists with keyboard glissandos using the knuckles), eventually establishing the ending key of C major and finishing in a flourish with a fortissimo C tonic ninth chord. Recordings There are more than 120 commercial recordings of this popular work. Prokofiev himself made the first in June 1932 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Piero Coppola at Abbey Road Studios in London; it is the only recording that exists of the composer performing one of his concertos. Martha Argerich famously recorded the work in 1967 with Claudio Abbado for Deutsche Grammophon; she recorded it again in 1997 with Charles Dutoit for EMI, this time winning a Grammy Award. Evgeny Kissin has made three recordings: in 1985, when he was 13 years old, with conductor Andrei Tchistiakov for the Russian export label Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga, released in the West on RCA; in 1993, live in Berlin, with Abbado for Deutsche Grammophon; and in 2008, live in London, with Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra for EMI, an effort that also garnered a Grammy Award. Pianist Horacio Guti√©rrez‚Äôs 1990 recording with Neeme J√§rvi and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra received acclaim upon its first release and again when reissued in 2009. But a survey of 70 recordings by International Piano Quarterly chose the 1996 live recording by Alexander Toradze with the Kirov Orchestra and Valery Gergiev as ‚ÄúHistorically the Best On Record.‚Äù Other recordings have been made by Julius Katchen, Lang Lang, Nikolai Lugansky, Van Cliburn, Mikhail Pletnev, Yefim Bronfman and more recently Behzod Abduraimov.

Lee before it was reincorporated. Born in South Carolina, he showed little early interest in politics, and his early career included the study of law and a tenure as a mathematics professor at the Charleston College from 1843 to 1855. In the late 1840s, as sectional issues roiled South Carolina politics, Miles began to speak up on sectional issues. He opposed both the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850. From then on, Miles would look at any northern efforts to restrict slavery as justification for secession. Miles was elected as mayor of Charleston in 1855 and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1857 until South Carolina seceded, in December 1860. He was a member of the state secession convention and a representative from South Carolina at the Confederate Convention in Montgomery, Alabama, which established the provisional government and constitution for the Confederate States. He represented his state in the Confederate House of Representatives during the American Civil War. Early life Miles was born in Walterboro, South Carolina to James Saunders Miles and Sarah Bond Worley Miles. His ancestors were French Huguenots and his grandfather, Major Felix Warley, fought in the American Revolution. His primary education came at Southworth School and he later attended Willington Academy where John C. Calhoun had matriculated a generation earlier. Miles enrolled at Charleston College in 1838 where he met future secession advocates James De Bow and William Henry Trescot. Miles graduated in 1842 and in 1843 he briefly studied law with a local attorney before returning to his alma mater as a mathematics professor.Walther pp. 270‚Äì272. Throughout the 1840s Miles showed little interest in active politics. He did not participate in the Bluffton Movement in 1844, although he did recognize that the 1846 Wilmot Proviso threatened his concepts of \\"southern rights, the equality of the states under the Constitution, and the honor of a slaveholding people.\\" In 1849 Miles was invited to speak at a Fourth of July celebration in Charleston.Walther p. 272 In this speech, Miles attacked the principles behind the Wilmot Proviso. While he believed that slavery was a \\"Divine institution,\\" he was willing to accept differences of opinion as long as antislavery advocates returned the favor by admitting that slavery was \\"recognized and countenanced\\" by the Constitution.Walther p. 274 To Miles, Northerners, in their efforts to legislate restrictions on slavery, were not simply raising an issue of constitutional interpretation. Miles argued: Miles rejected any compromise on slavery and supported Calhoun in opposition to the Compromise of 1850. However while activists within the state in 1850 and 1851 mobilized, Miles remained on the sidelines as Southern Rights associations and rallies dominated South Carolina politics. In 1852 Miles delivered an address to the Alumni Society of the Charleston College that included one of the frequent arguments of the Fire-Eaters. Addressing himself to the Declaration of Independence, Miles denied the concept of inalienable rights and maintained that liberty was an \\"Acquired Privilege.\\" He argued that \\"Men are born neither Free nor Equal\\" and some men were born with the innate ability to earn liberty while others were not. Government should not attempt to either \\"make a Statesman of him who God intended should be a Ploughman\\" or \\"bind down forever to the plough him to whom God has given a mind capable of shaping the destinies of a People.\\" From this point on in his career, Miles rejected the political legitimacy of abolitionists and free-soilers and responded to any attempts to restrict slavery with a call for secession.Walther pp. 275‚Äì277 In 1852 he delivered \\"Republican Government Not Always the Best\\" to members of College of Charleston graduation address.William Porcher Miles, Republican Government Not Always the Best (Charleston, 1852). Mayor of Charleston In the summer of 1855 a yellow fever epidemic hit the coast of Virginia. Eventually 2,000 people would die as well as half of the doctors who attempted to treat it. Virginia called for volunteers from the lower South where the disease was more common and residents had developed some natural immunity. Miles responded by serving for several weeks in Norfolk as a nurse. His heroic activities were reported back to Charleston, and his friends used the popularity generated by his activities to draft him as a candidate for mayor. Upon his return to Charleston he made only one public speech but was still elected mayor by a vote of 1,260 to 837.Walther p. 278 While serving as mayor, Miles lived at 53 Beaufain Street; the house no longer exists. Interested in reform, the new mayor first tackled police reform. After sending out fact finding missions to other cities, he implemented a plan that addressed the problem of excessive partisanship within the city council. Appointment responsibility was reassigned to the police chief for lower ranks and to the mayor, with city council approval, for higher ranks. He expanded patrols, cracked down on habitual offenders.Walther pp. 279‚Äì280 In the area of social reform, Miles created a house of corrections for juveniles, an almshouse, an orphanage and an asylum. He provided aid for transient poor and free black paupers and implemented a sewage system as a health measure. Having inherited a large public debt, he increased property taxes in an effort to retire the debt in 35 years. At the end of his two-year term he was widely judged to have been successful, leading him to consider further public office.Walther pp.280‚Äì281 United States House of Representatives In 1856 Miles ran for the seat being vacated by Congressman William Aiken Jr.. The national issues of slavery in Kansas and the rise of the Republican Party dominated the election. Miles argued that the election of the Republican candidate for president, John C. Fremont, would require a joint southern response that could include boycotting the new Congress and calling a southern convention to determine further action. In a three-way election Miles was victorious by a vote of 1,852 to 1,844 for his two opponents.Walther p. 281 When he took office in 1857 he found that the Kansas issues dominated Congressional debate, threatened the unity of the Democratic Party and increased the growth of the Republicans. His first speech on the House floor came in 1858 and argued the Southern position on Kansas. Despite his acknowledgement that the Kansas climate was not conducive to slavery, he stated: Miles was re-elected in 1858. In January 1859 he spoke in support of fellow fire-eater William Lowndes Yancey in advocating the repeal of federal laws banning the African slave trade. Miles felt that the regulation of the trade should be a state function and that the national ban was an insult to Southern honor. This stance was considered too radical even by his friends, such as Trescott, who felt, since it could never be supported by the majority of the nation, that Miles' stance was simply a guise to force disunion.Walther pp. 284‚Äì285 John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry sent a shock wave across the South. When the Thirty-sixth Congress met in December 1859 the first order of business was the selection of a speaker. Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper's book, The Impending Crisis and How to Meet It, which Southerners believed would ignite class warfare between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South.Heidler p. 141 Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country.Walther pp. 285‚Äì286 Miles conspired with South Carolina's governor to send a regiment of militia to Washington to break up the Congress in the event of Sherman's election, but the withdrawal of Sherman's nomination prevented action.Stephen A. Channing, Crisis of Fear: Secession in South Carolina, p. 112. In South Carolina the state legislature was unable to determine an appropriate response, but finally, reacting to a proposal by pro-secession Governor William Henry Gist decided to propose a Southern convention. As a first step Christopher Memminger was dispatched to Virginia in order to solicit their support. Miles advised Memminger to \\"urge our Carolina view in such a manner as to imbue Virginia with it ... [and] we may soon hope to see the fruit of your addresses in the sturdy and healthy offspring of whose birth we would be so greatly proud ‚Äî a Southern confederacy.Walther pp. 287‚Äì288 Heidler pp. 141‚Äì142 South Carolina Secession =Election of 1860= By 1860 Miles was one of the leading secessionists in South Carolina. His position in Washington, D.C., allowed him to serve as a conduit in the flow of information between Washington and Charleston.Walther p. 289 State politicians focused on the upcoming Democratic Convention scheduled in Charleston beginning on April 23. Miles was concerned about the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas, especially rumors that there might even be a pro-Douglas faction in South Carolina. Miles and other radicals were convinced that only a strictly Southern party could properly address the state's needs.Cauthen p. 15 The convention deadlocked over the party platform. Southerners opposed Douglas' support for popular sovereignty ‚Äì a concept which would have allowed new territories to decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery. Southerners preferred federal guarantees that slavery would be allowed in all United States territories. Thirteen of the 16 South Carolina delegates walked out of the convention.Cauthen p.18 In May Miles returned to Charleston and declared that the next election would pit \\"power against principle ‚Äì the majority against the minority, regardless of all constitutional barriers.\\" Support for secession was strong in South Carolina even before Lincoln's election. Miles pressed the issue, urging action as opposed to simply more discussion.Cauthen p.26 Miles stated, according to a July 24 newspaper account: Miles argued that South Carolina should \\"break up things generally, which any state can at any time do.\\" He believed that the South had \\"all the elements of wealth, prosperity and strength, to make her a first-class power among the nations of the world\\" and would \\"lose so little and gain so much\\" with secession.\\" In August Miles was struck with typhoid fever and went to New England to recover, not returning to the state until the November elections.Walther p. 290 =Secession winter= As secession loomed, President James Buchanan was concerned about the safety of United States property in South Carolina. Miles, returning to Washington for the upcoming session of Congress, was one of the South Carolina delegates who met with Buchanan to discuss this problem. On December 10 Miles and the others presented a letter to the President that assured him that the forts in Charleston would not be molested \\"provided that no reinforcement should be sent into those forts, and their relative military status\\" maintained.Cauthen pp. 94‚Äì95 Buchanan questioned the word \\"provided\\" since it appeared to bind him, but the delegates assured him that they were only communicating their understanding based on the status quo. According to both Miles and fellow South Carolina fire-eater Laurence M. Keitt, Buchanan said, \\"After all, this is a matter of honor among gentlemen. I do not know that any paper or writing is necessary. We understand each other.\\"Cauthen p. 95 Returning to South Carolina, Miles was elected as a delegate to the South Carolina secession convention. Miles was for immediate action. On December 17, fearing that even a few days of delay could be critical, he opposed the relocation of the convention from Columbia to Charleston due to a smallpox outbreak. Miles' last communications with southerners in Washington told him that they were all looking to South Carolina for leadership. Miles attitude was reflected in his statement, \\"Let us act if we mean to act without talking. Let it be 'a word and a blow ‚Äì but the blow first.\\" Walther p. 291 The convention adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20. Miles, along with other South Carolinians, immediately resigned his seat in Congress.Cauthen p. 70 In the months ahead, Miles, believing in the possibility of peaceful secession, opposed precipitate action over either Fort Sumter or the Star of the West incident. In February 1861 Miles was one of eight South Carolina delegates to the Confederate Convention in Montgomery, Alabama, that established the Confederacy.Cauthen p. 85 Confederate States Congress Miles was selected for both the provisional and regular Confederate Congress. He was chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee while also serving as an aide-de-camp for General P. G. T. Beauregard at both Charleston, in the buildup to the attack on Fort Sumter, and the First Battle of Bull Run. Recognizing, however, his own lack of military training, Miles focused most of his attention on his congressional duties.Walther pp. 290‚Äì291 Historian Eric H. Walther describes Miles tenure in the Confederate Congress: While serving in the Confederate Provisional Congress, Miles chaired the \\"Committee on the Flag and Seal,\\" which adopted the \\"Stars and Bars\\" flag as the national flag of the Confederacy. Miles opposed this selection because, he felt, it too much resembled, as supporters of it admitted, the old Stars and Stripes. Miles argued: Miles' rejected flag proposal, ancestor to the Battle Flag Miles favored his own design. When General P.G.T. Beauregard decided a more recognizable Battle Flag was needed, Miles' suggested his design. Although this design had been rejected by the committee for a national flag, it eventually became the Confederate Battle Flag, today often referred to as a \\"Rebel flag\\" or the \\"Southern Cross.\\" Miles' design was later used as the canton in the second version of the national flag (nicknamed the \\"Stainless Banner\\") as well as in the third national design (nicknamed the \\"Blood-Stained Banner\\"). Later life As late as January 1865, Miles offered a resolution in Congress stating, \\"That we, the representatives of the people of the Confederate States, are firmly determined to continue the struggle in which we are involved until the United States shall acknowledge our independence.\\"Walther p. 292 Describing Miles's feelings shortly after the war ended and quoting from a September 25, 1865 letter, Walther wrote: Miles had married Bettie Beirne in 1863, the daughter of a wealthy Virginia planter, Oliver Beirne, and granddaughter of Representative Andrew Beirne. For a few years after the war, he worked for his father-in-law as a factor in New Orleans. In 1867, Miles took over the management of Oak Ridge Plantation in Nelson County, Virginia. He encountered serious financial problems as a tobacco and wheat farmer, and in 1874, he unsuccessfully applied for the position of president at the new Hopkins University of Baltimore. Miles remained on the farm and helped friends like Beauregard and former Fire-Eater Robert Rhett gather materials for their own histories of the Confederacy.Walther p. 293 In 1880, Miles was appointed president of the newly-reopened South Carolina College. After his father-in-law's death in 1882, Miles took over the family business interests and relocated to Houmas House in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, where he managed a dozen plantations that Oliver Beirne had inherited just one year before at the death of his longtime friend, John Burnside. In 1892, with his son, he formed Miles Planting and Manufacturing Company of Louisiana.Walther 294‚Äì295 Miles died on May 13, 1899 at 76 and was interred at Green Hill Cemetery in Union, West Virginia.Walther p. 296 Notes References * Cauthen, Charles Edward.

Phillips and published by Hewson Consultants in the late 1980s for various home computer systems. International releases and ports were known by various other names, including Castelian, , Subline and Tower Toppler. The game's original 8-bit release received some critical acclaim, in particular the Commodore 64 release, which garnered a Gold Medal award from UK magazine Zzap!64. Nebulus was followed by a lesser- known sequel, Nebulus 2, on the Amiga in the 1990s. An Atari ST version was also in development but was cancelled.  Gameplay  Screenshot from the Amiga version Nebulus is a platform game with some distinctive unique features. The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built in the sea, by planting bombs at the towers' peaks. Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles, which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower. The actual gameplay happens at each tower in turn. Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top. The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators. Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no \\"left\\" or \\"right\\" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower. Screenshot from the Palm OS version. A graphical innovation, and perhaps the most notable feature of the game, is that when Pogo walks left or right, he always stays in the centre of the visible screen. Instead of the Pogo sprite moving, the tower behind him turns clockwise or counterclockwise with a convincing sense of depth. This was noted favourably in reviews of the game. Along his way to the top of the tower, Pogo encounters many different enemies, mostly shaped like basic geometric shapes. Pogo can shoot some of the enemies, while some are impervious to shooting. Contact with an enemy knocks Pogo down to the ledge below. If there is no ledge below, Pogo falls into the sea and drowns. Once he has reached the top of the tower, Pogo needs to enter a door to trigger the tower's destruction mechanism. After that, the tower crumbles to the sea. Pogo then boards his submarine and enters a bonus stage (in some versions, but not for example in the ZX Spectrum version), where he can shoot various kinds of fish to score bonus points.  Releases and ports  Castelian, the Game Boy port The game was originally released by Hewson for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and Acorn Archimedes. The US version, which was published by U.S. Gold, was released under the title Tower Toppler. A version for the Atari 7800 was also released with this title. The Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System versions of Castelian were developed by Bits Studios and released in the United States by Triffix and in Japan by Hiro Entertainment; in these, the lead character is called Julius. The Game Boy and Nintendo versions were later released in Japan as Kyoro Chan Land, which replaced Julius with Kyorochan, jewels with Chocoballs, altered the enemy graphics and (in the Famicom version) added a password system and a pause feature. The Italian bootleg version was called Subline. The Nintendo versions were composed by David Whittaker, and the title songs were covered by Whittaker from the original Tower Toppler game's title screen. In the Famicom version, the title screen plays what is the bonus game theme from the US version. In 2004 it was re-released on the C64 Direct-to-TV. On June 20, 2008, the C64 DTV version made its comeback on the Wii's Virtual Console download service in Europe on June 13, 2008 and later in North America on May 4, 2009. The Atari 8-bit version was being developed around 1988 by the author of the Atari 7800 port, and was intended to be released by Atari Corporation for the XE Game System. However, although the game appeared in Atari promotional material of the time, it never reached the market. The game's prototype cartridge was later found.  Reception  Compute! stated that the Commodore 64 version of Tower Toppler had \\"good arcade action, with well-executed graphics\\". Orson Scott Card wrote in the magazine that \\"the graphics are terrific ... As science fiction, it's fun but shallow. As an action game, it's just plain fun\\". Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, saying, \\"Between delightfully benign game play ..., clever obstacles (though none are very difficult to figure out), and lively animation, you will have a great time with this game. Well, maybe you won't, but I will.\\" It earned a Zzap! Gold Medal Award. The game was voted Best Original Game Of The Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. The ZX Spectrum version was rated number 30 in the Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time. The Amiga version was ranked the 14th best game of all time by Amiga Power.

It is a specific type of apheresis, the more general term for separating out one particular constituent of blood and returning the remainder to the circulation. Leukapheresis may be performed to decrease a very high white blood cell count, to obtain blood cells from a patient (autologous) or donor (allogeneic) for later transplant into the patient, or to obtain cells for research purposes. In the case of hematological malignancies such as chronic leukemias, white blood cell counts may be high enough to cause leukostasis and \\"sludging\\" in the capillaries (acute leukemias have a more variable white cell count whereas chronic cases typically have higher white cell counts). This can affect retinal vasculature leading to vision changes, pulmonary vasculature leading to shortness of breath from decreased efficiency in oxygen exchange, as well as other organ systems such as the brain which would become clinically apparent with neurological deterioration of a patient from cerebrovascular compromise. Leukapheresis may be performed to obtain the patient's own blood cells for later transplant. White blood cells may be removed to protect them from damage before high-dose chemotherapy, then transfused back into the patient, in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.Transfusion. 2003 Feb;43(2):259-64. Leukapheresis after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation: a novel approach to harvest a second autograft. Schwella N, Braun A, Ahrens N, Rick O, Salama A. Another novel use of cells obtained through leukapheresis is to stimulate a patient‚Äôs immune system to target prostate cancer cells. Alternatively, only granulocytes, macrophages and monocytes may be removed, leaving the lymphocyte count largely unchanged. This is used as a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis * National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Leukapheresis for inflammatory bowel disease (guidance). Retrieved Oct. 06 2005 and rheumatoid arthritis, where these cells play an active part in the inflammation process. Leukapheresis, typically for granulocytes, is a rarely performed blood donation process. The product is collected by automated apheresis and is used for systemic infections in patients with neutropenia. The donor is typically a blood relative who has received stimulating medications (a directed donation), and the product is irradiated to prevent GVHD. The product generally has a 24-hour shelf life from collection and is often transfused before infectious disease testing is completed. It is a therapy of last resort, and its use is controversial and rare. Leukapheresis is used in evolving CAR-T cell therapy to obtain leukocytes from a cancer patient or donor which can be modified and given to the patient as a therapeutic dose. Etymology The word leukapheresis () uses combining forms of leuk- + apheresis, although it quite plausibly could be parsed as leuko- + pheresis, as both of those forms are accepted alternate forms (leuk-/leuko-; apheresis/pheresis). The latter parsing explains why people often spell the word with an -o- as *leukopheresis; nonetheless, no professionally curated dictionaries as of 2016 enter that spelling, and it is traditionally treated as a misspelling by medical style guides that mention it.

Description  The dove has a blue-grey breast with chequered brown-bronze wings. The nape is similar to that of the peaceful dove in that the nape feathers are striated but differs in that the bar-shouldered dove does not have striated throat feathers like the peaceful dove. Furthermore, the nape feathers are copper in colour. These doves are also often confused with the introduced and common spotted turtle dove. The eye ring tends to be grey but red-brown when breeding. The juveniles are duller in colour. Doves are often found in pairs, groups or large loose flocks and are seen commonly feeding on the ground feeding on seeds. Flight is direct and swift and wings whistle while the birds are in flight.  Habitat  Bar-shouldered doves are usually found in thick vegetation where water is present, damp gullies, forests and gorges, mangroves, plantations, swamps, eucalyptus woodlands, tropical and sub- tropical scrubs and river margins. They can be found in both inland and coastal regions. The bar-shouldered dove is found throughout the east coast from southern New South Wales (with increasing numbers in the Blue Mountains and Illawarra regions), north to Cape York Peninsula and west to the Pilbara region (about Onslow, Western Australia). They have been observed with increasing frequency in southern Australia (specifically north-western Victoria) but may have been displaced in other natural locations by introduced species. They have also been observed in the Torres Strait and are also found in other countries of the South Pacific region, such as Papua New Guinea.  Breeding  Breeding season is from September to January in the south and February to April in the north. Its nest is a flat twig and grass platform usually in trees and shrubs, mangrove or scrub. The dove will lay two, white, glossy and rounded eggs.  Parasites  A bar-shouldered dove was found to be infected by Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of toxoplasmosis, in a French zoo.

The choir's current artistic director and conductor, since 2013, is Saara Aittakumpu. PK's a cappella repertoire consists mainly of classical music, ranging from Renaissance madrigals to the Romantic era and contemporary works, and also includes occasional forays to other genres such as jazz. A centerpiece of the choir's choral symphonic repertoire has been Jean Sibelius' symphonic poem Kullervo. In 2015, the choir made its debut at the BBC Proms, performing Sibelius' Kullervo with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo. In addition to performances a cappella and with orchestras, the choir, its quartets and other smaller ensembles frequently perform at private, corporate and academic festivities. The Polytech Choir has commissioned and premiered nearly 40 new works for male choir during the past 20 years, including two International Rostrum of Composers prizewinners by Jukka Tiensuu and Eero H√§meenniemi, and performed Finnish premieres of works by Luciano Berio and Toru Takemitsu.

He helped turn post World War I Bavaria into Germany's center of radical-nationalism, but was then instrumental in the collapse and suppression of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. In revenge for the latter, he was murdered later in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives. Biography Born in Wei√üenburg in Bayern, Kahr studied law and worked as a lawyer before entering politics. He served Bavaria's House of Wittelsbach faithfully, efforts that earned him the title Ritter.. Politically, he was a monarchist and had links to the Catholic Bavarian People's Party (BVP), though he was a Protestant and never joined any party. In 1917, he became head of the Regierungsbezirk (provincial) government of Upper Bavaria, continuing in the post even after the establishment of the People's State of Bavaria in November 1918 ended the Wittelsbach monarchy, though for pragmatic reasons: he wanted to help defend middle- and upper-class interests from further disruption. In support of this goal, Kahr proposed the creation of a civil defence force, but his suggestion did not meet with the approval of Prime Minister Johannes Hoffmann. Not long after, in April 1919, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. Kahr fled Munich with Hoffmann and the rest of the state government to Bamberg, where they called for volunteers to help crush the Soviet. Those who responded were organised into Freikorps.. It was after the suppression of the Bavarian Soviet Republic at the beginning of May, which saw hundreds of civilians murdered by Freikorps fighters, that Kahr delved into Bavarian paramilitary politics. Munich's leaders wanted to maintain the capabilities of the Freikorps, but without their drawbacks. In brief, the Freikorps were too violent, too small, and too independent of the Bavarian state. The Civil Guards, or Einwohnerwehr, was formed in an attempt to resolve these deficiencies.. In March 1920, Kahr succeeded Hoffmann as prime minister of Bavaria. He came into office under military influences as a secondary result of the Kapp-L√ºttwitz Putsch of 13 March in Berlin. The most powerful party in Bavaria, the BVP, was then in a state of much anxiety as a result of the experiences of Bolshevism, chaos, and violence through which Munich had passed in the spring of 1919. The ministry presided over by the socialist Hoffmann had succeeded in quelling Bolshevism with the aid of Republican troops from Prussia and W√ºrttemberg, but the great majority of the BVP, as well as liberals of various shades, not to speak of the monarchists and reactionaries, wanted further guarantees against a recurrence of the Bolshevist terror. The Kapp-L√ºttwitz Putsch in Berlin gave the signal for political action in Munich, and at a midnight sitting the Bavarian socialist ministry was somewhat unceremoniously hustled out of office ‚Äî it is alleged under military pressure ‚Äî and a coalition cabinet under Kahr installed. The coalition included reactionaries whose influence became more and more predominant. They were backed up by formerly liberal Bavarian journals which had been bought up by Prussian industrialists. Gustav von Kahr (left) and Erich Ludendorff (center), 1921 Kahr's administration was essential in turning Bavaria into a \\"Ordnungszelle\\" (cell of order), giving room for all kinds of right-wing groups. He also supported separatist forces that aimed at Bavarian secession from Germany, but after the German government passed a decree for the protection of the Republic against right-wing extremists, Kahr resigned on 21 September 1921. On 26 September 1923, following a period of turmoil with assassinations and political violence, Prime Minister Eugen von Knilling declared martial law and appointed Kahr, who had returned to his provincial post, as Staatskomissar (state commissioner) with dictatorial powers. Together with Bavarian State Police head Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser, and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, he formed a triumvirate. That year, many reactionary groups wanted to emulate Mussolini's \\"March on Rome\\" with a \\"March on Berlin.\\" Among these were the wartime General Erich Ludendorff and the Nazi (NSDAP) group, led by Adolf Hitler. Hitler decided to use Ludendorff as a figurehead in an attempt to seize power in what was later known as the \\"Hitler Putsch\\" or Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Kahr and his triumvirate. However, Kahr had his own plan with Seisser (Sei√üer) and Lossow to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler. Kahr warned the \\"patriotic associations\\" against independent action. Despite his misgivings over Hitler's tactics, Kahr was every bit a right-wing patriot who stood against the Weimar government and believed action against those in Berlin was warranted. Akin to the later and infamous rhetoric of Hitler, Kahr remarked to an assembly of high-ranking officers on 19 October 1923 that the real matter at hand was \\"a great battle of two worldviews which will decide the destiny of the German people - the international Marxist- Jewish and the national Germanic.\\" Along this line, Kahr was not unlike many conservative Germans and his identification of perceived foreign threats is a defining feature of post-1918 German ideology; against which, it was widely believed, Germans had to make a stand. Accordingly, Kahr and his right-wing compatriots wanted to challenge the seeming cowardice of the extant government of Germany and eventually seize control since he found the Weimar Constitution and its leadership decidedly un-German in disposition. Weighing on Kahr's mind however, were injunctions from Berlin against reactionary activities. All the rage amid right-wing groups in Bavaria against the resumption of war- reparation payments did not temper the determination of the government in Berlin. The Weimar leadership's staunch warnings against revolutionary activities included military intervention if necessary. Troops under the command of General von Seeckt (who was previously identified among the right- wing circles as a possible choice for dictator) were poised and positioned for action. Stern warnings were reiterated by General von Seeckt, prompting the triumvirate of Kahr, Lossow, and Seisser to lose heart, at which point they informed the members of Kampfbund, (which was headed by Hitler) that they would determine when precipitate action would be taken. This did not sit well with Hitler. Hitler was determined to act before the appeal of his agitation waned. On 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people that had been organized by Kahr in the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller, a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler interrupted Kahr's speech and announced that the national revolution had begun, declaring the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. While waving his gun around, Hitler demanded the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded at occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters; however, neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler. Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow were briefly detained but then released. The three quickly fled to join the opposition to Hitler. During the night, and unknown to Hitler, they prepared the resistance against the coup. The following day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government as a prelude to their \\"March on Berlin\\", but the police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Kahr's involvement in the collapse of Hitler's putsch cost him the support of right-wing nationalist forces in Bavaria. Kahr was forced to resign from his post as Staatskommissar on 16 February 1924, after Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx had secretly met von Knilling on 18 January 1924 and convinced him to drop both von Kahr and von Lossow. After this, Kahr served as President of the Bavarian law court for reviewing administrative acts and then, having sunk into relative obscurity, retired from public service three years later. Death On 30 June 1934, during what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, Kahr was brutally murdered by the Nazis for his \\"treason\\" during the Beer Hall Putsch. He was abducted from his Munich apartment and tortured by two SS members en route to the Dachau concentration camp. After his arrival there, Kahr was shot on orders of Theodor Eicke, the camp commandant. Historian Thomas Childers reports that Kahr was taken to a nearby swamp and hacked to death with axes. Whether he was shot first is unknown, but his mutilated body was found outside the camp a few days later.

On 1 January 2013 the former municipality of Erschmatt merged into the municipality of Leuk.Nomenklaturen ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 9 February 2013 Historic aerial photograph by Werner Friedli from 1949 Since it controls access to the Gemmi Pass, it had some importance from the time of Roman Raetia. The Leukerbad thermal baths are just north of Leuk, towards the pass. It is the capital of the Leuk district of the Valais. Leuk is home to one of the known installations of Onyx, the Swiss interception system for signals intelligence gathering.Swiss Federal Department of Defense, Deux nouvelles antennes sur le site du DDPS de Lo√®che. 24 October 2005 Press release History Leuk is first mentioned in 515 as villa de Leuca. Leuk was already inhabited in the pre-Roman era. Scattered La T√®ne era graves with poppy-head pins, brooches and a belt hook have been found in Leuk. In the 6th century it belonged to the demesne of the King of Burgundy Sigismund, who donated it to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice. The local population of Romanized Celts gradually became Germanized around the turn of the millennium due to invading Alamanni. However, even by the 14th century there was still a strong Roman minority in Leuk. Romanesque tower of St. Stephan's church The town's first church dates from the 6th or 7th century and probably originated from a Roman building. This church was replaced in the 9th century by a larger building. It was replaced again in the 11th and 12th centuries. The romanesque bell tower of the current church is from this third building. The current church was built by Ulrich Ruffiner in the gothic style. It was richly furnished with altars and sculptures and was consecrated in 1494 as St. Stephan's Church by Bishop Jost von Silenen. In the charnel house, with its dance of death fresco, 26 statues dating from the 13th to 16th centuries were discovered in 1982 under about a meter (three feet) of bones. The statues including an excellent Piet√† from the 14th century. In addition to St. Stephan's parish church there were several other churches in town. They include a pilgrimage chapel at Thel and the Ringacker chapel, which was built in 1690-94 above a plague cemetery. A Marian shrine, whose hermitage was inhabited by a hermit around 1720‚Äì1885, is one of the most important baroque rooms of the Valais. In the Early and High Middle Ages Leuk changed owners repeatedly until 1138 when it finally came under the authority of the Bishop of Sion. The new rulers encouraged Leuk's development by granting concessions. In 1209 Leuk was given the right to have its own weights and measures. In 1285 they built a hospital and in 1310 they added a warehouse, one on the old trade route between northern Italy and the markets of Champagne. With the warehouse they established a group of teamsters that provided extra draft animals to help wagons make it over the mountains. The episcopal fiefholders Viztum and Meier built the Bishop's Castle (the seat of Meier) and the Viztumsturm (Viztum's tower). In the 14th century the castle ruled over three surrounding areas; Loye (Lobio), Tschablen (Cabulo) and Galdinen (Caldana). All three of those areas grew into independent municipalities. In 1458, Leuk codified the customary rights of the citizens into law. This \\"old castle law\\" was updated in 1563. With the decline of the feudal system, the weakening of the secular episcopal power and the rise of the democratic self-consciousness of the Valais, the old order was replaced with a new power structure. The former leading families of de Leuca, Perrini, von Raron and Pontemallio were replaced with new families who had made their money in military service including: the Werra, Mageran, Allet, Amb√ºhl, Albertini, Gasner, Mayenzet, Zen-Ruffinen and Loretan. The village subsequently grew into an independent town with elegant homes and a new church. On the west, a tower and bridge were built in the Dala gorge. The Feschel gorge to the east was spanned with a bridge in 1563. The two gorges and the river Rhone to the south provided excellent natural fortifications for the growing town. The borders of the town were the site of several bloody clashes. The first was the victory in 1296 of troops loyal to the bishop over the upper Valais nobility (including the vom Turn and von Raron families), who were supported by nobles from the Bernese Oberland. In 1386, Leuk prevented the advance of Count Amadeus VII of Savoy into the Upper Valais with the destruction of Dala bridge. In 1415, during the Rarner war, the Bishop's Castle and the Viztumsturm were destroyed by invaders. In 1541, Ulrich Ruffiner built the present Gothic-style town hall on the ruins of the Viztumsturm. During the fighting against the French in 1799, after the Battle of Pfyn Leuk was burned but escaped further damage. The parish of Leuk is first documented in 1227. Starting in 1500 a number of surrounding villages left the Leuk parish to form their own daughter parishes, including; 1501 Leukerbad, 1660 Gampel, 1663 Turtmann, 1962 Susten. In the second half of the 16th century, the leading Leuker families tended to Protestantism. However, in 1604, when the Valais Grand Council met in Visp and voted to remain with the Catholic faith, these the families (especially the Mageran and Amb√ºhl) decided to return to the old faith. In the Middle Ages, the local economy was based on the transport of goods, alpine herding, farming and viticulture. The town produced gravel from the banks of the Rhone in the Pfynwald (Pfyn forest), until this was restricted for environmental reasons in the 1970s. Limestone mining commenced in 1928 on the Rhone in Susten but has now been given up. In 2005 there were ten large farms and seven wineries in the municipality. In 1908 the Alusuisse-Werke (now Alcan Ltd) opened a processing plant in Chippis and Steg which provided jobs for many people from Leuk. The Leuk-Leukerbad- Bahn railway line opened in 1915 and converted to bus operation in 1967. In 2005, the train station in Susten was rebuilt with a new railway bridge over the Rhone and a new rail tunnel towards Salgesch. Traditionally Leuk was the central administrative center of the region. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is also the educational, legal and services center in part due to the satellite earth station of International Teleport Switzerland AG. The large antennas of the earth station have made Leuk into a major intercontinental telecommunications center. Near the earth station are the antennas of the Swiss military Onyx system for electronic intelligence gathering. In 1999, the Leuk Castle Foundation was established to restore and maintain the Bishop's Castle in Leuk. As part of the restoration, one of the medieval towers was topped with a glass cupola by the architect Mario Botta. Geography Bridge over the Dala gorge Leuk has an area, , of . Of this area, 19.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while 48.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 4.8% is settled (buildings or roads) and 26.8% is unproductive land. The municipality is the capital of the Leuk district. It is located above the right side of the Rhone, between the Dala gorge and the Feschelbach river. The town is surrounded by vineyards. It consists of the village of Leuk-Stadt, the castle, the village of Susten on the left bank of the Rhone and the hamlets of Brianen, Feithieren, Gampinen and Pfyn.

Bibesco's papers are at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Early life Born Marta Lucia Lahovary (also spelled Lahovari) in Bucharest as the third child of Ioan Lahovary and Princess Emma Mavrocordat, Marthe spent her childhood at the Lahovary family estates in Balote»ôti and the fashionable French sea-resort of Biarritz. On her first introduction into society, in 1900, she met Crown Prince Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the Romanian throne, but after a secret engagement of one year, Marthe married at seventeen Prince George III Valentin Bibescu (Bibesco), scion of one of the country's prestigious aristocratic families. I stepped onto the European stage through the grand door, she wrote on her wedding day. Her father, who had been educated in France, held the post of minister of the Kingdom of Romania in Paris and, later, that of minister of foreign affairs of Romania. Fluent in French at an early age (even before she could speak Romanian), Marthe spent the first years of her marriage under the tutelage of her mother-in-law, Princess Valentine Bibesco (n√©e countess Riquet de Caraman-Chimay), who saw to it that the extensive education in European history and literature Marthe already had was reinforced. An old peasant woman, Baba U»õa [Outza], saw to it that she was also well-versed in Romanian folk traditions and tales. Meanwhile, her husband, George, was chasing fast cars and other women, but adding to the family fortune at the same time. Before World War I Painting of Marthe Bibesco (1911), Giovanni Boldini Despite her wide circle of friends, and the birth of her daughter Valentine in 1903, Marthe was bored. In 1905, when George was sent by the Romanian king Carol I on a diplomatic mission to Mozzafar-al-Din, Shah of Iran, she eagerly embarked on the trip, recording her observations in a journal. Along the way, she stopped at Yalta, where she encountered the exiled Russian writer Maxim Gorki. It was in 1908, at the suggestion of Maurice Barr√®s, that Marthe completed and published her impressions of her Persian trip. The French critics and writers were enthusiastic and extremely complimentary. The travel memoirs, Les Huit Paradis (\\"The Eight Paradises\\"), launched her on a lifelong career as a successful writer of both nonfiction and novels. She became the toast of Belle Epoque Paris, moving easily among the literary, aristocratic and political power elites. She was awarded the Prix de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and met Marcel Proust, who sent her a letter praising her book: You are not only a splendid writer, Princess, but a sculptor of words, a musician, a purveyor of scents, a poet. Back in Bucharest, in 1908, Marthe was introduced to the German Kronprinz, Wilhelm. Wilhelm (who, despite Marthe's references to him as \\" the III\\", was never to succeed Wilhelm II) was married, but he nevertheless wrote warmly affectionate letters to Marthe for the following fifteen years. She and her husband were invited to Germany, in the autumn of the same year, as Wilhelm's personal guests, visiting Berlin, Potsdam, Weimar, and taking part in the imperial regatta at Kiel. Marthe was awarded the supreme honour of accompanying Wilhelm in the imperial limousine, as it passed through the Brandenburg Gate, an entitlement otherwise reserved to members of the imperial family. He would also try to involve Marthe in the international relations of pre-war Europe, secretly asking her to be the quiet mediator between France and Germany on the Alsace-Lorraine issue. Among the European nobility, divorce was social death, but dalliance was definitely not. While Marthe and George continued in what was sometimes actually a mutually supportive partnership, they pursued their own interests. The French prince Charles-Louis de Beauvau-Craon fell in love with Marthe, an affair that lasted for a decade. In Paris, she also encountered the Roman Catholic Abb√© Mugnier, who converted her from her Eastern Orthodox faith, and she began an extensive, frank correspondence with him that was to last 36 years. Exhausted by so many sentimental disappointments, Marthe withdrew to Algeria, then part of the French colonial Empire, to stay with an aunt of her husband, Jeanne Bibesco, thinking about divorcing George and espousing the prince de Beauvau-Craon. Still, she felt she could not do it; George would prove to be surprisingly generous and understanding, giving her the Mogo»ôoaia Palace (Mogoso√´a in certain French renderings) in 1912. A couple of months before World War I, Marthe visited Spain, following the footsteps of Chateaubriand, her favorite French writer. In May, she was back in her country to greet Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family, who were visiting the country after being invited by Princess Marie, wife of Prince Ferdinand. Literary glory In March 1915 Marthe met Christopher Thomson, the British military attach√©, at a Palace soir√©e; he was arranging for Romania to join the Allies (although he did not agree with the policy, as Romania was unprepared for war). He remained devoted to her for the rest of his life. They corresponded regularly, and she dedicated four books to \\"C.B.T.\\" Later he was a Labour peer, and Secretary of State for Air. She visited the site of his death in the R101 airship accident on December 1930 with their mutual friend the Abb√© Mugnier.Masefield, Sir Peter G. (1982) To Ride the Storm: the Story of the Airship R.101; pp. 18‚Äì20, 35‚Äì36, 415. London: William Kimber When Romania at last entered the war on the Allied side in 1916, Marthe worked at a hospital in Bucharest until the German army burned down her home in Posada, in the Transylvanian Alps. She fled the country to join her mother and daughter in Geneva after a quarantine exile, imposed by the German occupiers, in Austria-Hungary (as a guest of the princely family of Thurn und Taxis at Latchen). There she continued to write. For most of her life, she wrote every morning until lunchtime‚Äîher journals alone fill 65 volumes. In Switzerland, she began work on Isvor, pays des saules (\\"Isvor, Land of Willows\\"). It was Marthe's Romanian masterpiece, where she brilliantly conveyed the everyday life and customs of her people, the extraordinary mixture of superstition, deep philosophy, resignation and hope, and the unending struggle between age-old pagan beliefs and Christian faith. Tragedy didn't spare Marthe, as her younger sister and her mother would commit suicide in 1918 and 1920 respectively. For the Bibescos life after the war was more cosmopolitan than Romanian. Among her literary friends and acquaintances, Marthe counted Jean Cocteau, Paul Val√©ry, Rainer Maria Rilke, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Max Jacob, and Francis Jammes. In 1919, Marthe was invited to Prince Antoine Bibesco's wedding in London to Elizabeth Asquith, daughter of the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, H. H. Asquith, later Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Princess Elizabeth Bibesco, who died in Romania during World War II, is buried in the Bibesco family vault on the grounds of Mogo»ôoaia. Marthe for many years occupied an apartment in Prince Antoine's Quai Bourbon house at which she held literary and political salons. During this postwar period she rebuilt Posada, her mountain home, and began restoring the other family estate, Mogo»ôoaia, the palace built in Byzantine style. Again in London, she met Winston Churchill in 1920, starting a warm friendship that would last until his death in 1965. When her daughter Valentine married the Romanian prince Dimitrie Ghika-ComƒÉne»ôti (24 November 1925) in a dazzling traditional ceremony, three Queens attended, (Queen-mother Sophia of Greece, Princess Consort Aspasia Manos of Greece and Queen Marie of Yugoslavia). Moving around Europe, acclaimed as each new book appeared--Le Perroquet Vert (1923), Catherine-Paris (1927), Au bal avec Marcel Proust (1928)--Marthe gravitated toward political power more than anything else. Without forgetting the former Kronprinz, Marthe had a short love affair with Alfonso XIII of Spain, and another with the French Socialist representative Henry de Jouvenel. In the latter case, the class differences shattered their relationship, something that Marthe used as the basis of her novel √âgalit√© (\\"Equality\\", 1936). The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Ramsay MacDonald, found her fascinating. She visited him often in London and was his guest at Chequers. He wrote many touching, tender letters to her. Their close friendship ended only with his death. Accompanying George, who was by then chasing fast planes ‚Äì in addition to his numerous women ‚Äì Marthe flew everywhere: the United Kingdom (she counted among her friends the Duke of Devonshire Edward Cavendish, the Duke of Sutherland George, Vita Sackville-West, Philip Sassoon, Enid Bagnold, Violet Trefusis, Lady Leslie and Rothschild family members), Belgium, Italy (where she met Benito Mussolini in 1936), the Italian colony of Tripolitania (Libya), Istanbul, the United States (in 1934, as guests of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor), Ragusa, Belgrade and Athens. Whatever she wrote was a critical success and also sold well. But the money wasn't enough to cover the heavy expenses of her Mogo»ôoaia project (where the pavement of the Grand Hall is covered with gold), so she began writing popular romances under the pseudonym Lucile D√©caux, and articles for fashion magazines under her own name. She had a long-term contract with The Saturday Evening Post and Paris-Soir. In the 1920s and the 1930s, Mogo»ôoaia Palace was to become the second League of Nations, as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Louis Barthou, put it. There, annually, Marthe hosted royalty (among others, Gustav V of Sweden and the Queen of Greece), aristocracy (princes Faucigny-Lucinge, Princes de Ligne, the Churchills, the Cahen d'Anvers), politicians and ministers, diplomats and writers (Paul Morand, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry). As the winds of war began again to sweep across Europe, the princess began to prepare. She visited Germany in 1938 to see Wilhelm, and was introduced to Hermann G√∂ring; she visited the United Kingdom in 1939 to meet George Bernard Shaw. Her older grandson, John-Nicholas Ghika-ComƒÉne»ôti, was sent to school in England in the same year (he was not to see his homeland again for 56 years). Romania entered the war in 1941, this time on the losing side. Prince George III Bibesco died on 2 June 1941; their relationship strengthened during his illness, even though he kept his mistresses. After visiting German-occupied Paris and Venice, she made a top-secret visit to Turkey in 1943 together with her cousin, Prince Barbu II »òtirbey (Barbo Stirbey), trying to negotiate Romania's withdrawal from the Second World War. When the Red Army invaded her country, Marthe had a passport and connections enabling her to leave on 7 September 1945. Ironically it was not Marthe but her cousin Antoine Bibesco's wife Elizabeth who was the last Bibesco to be buried on the grounds of Mogo»ôoaia after her death on 7 April 1945. Neither Marthe nor Antoine would ever return to Romania. When the communist government took power in 1948, it confiscated all Bibesco property. She spent the remainder of her life in Paris and England. Exile Eventually, Valentine and her husband were released from Romanian detention in 1958, and allowed passage to Britain, where Marthe, now totally dependent on her writing for money, bought them a home, the Tullimaar residence at Perranarworthal in Cornwall. She remained in Paris, first living at the Ritz Hotel (1946‚Äì1948), then in her apartment at 45, Quai de Bourbon. In 1955, she was appointed a member of the Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature, on the seat previously held by Anna de Noailles (n√©e Bibesco, princess Bassaraba de Brancovan). Marthe cherished the 1962 award of the L√©gion d'honneur. It was in 1960 that her novel (27 years- in-the-making), La Nymphe Europe, which was really her autobiography, was published by Plon. Now a grande dame, she enjoyed her last great friendship with a powerful leader, Charles de Gaulle, who invited her in 1963 to an √âlys√©e Palace reception in the honour of the Swedish Sovereigns. De Gaulle also took a copy of Isvor, Pays des Saules with him when he visited Romania in 1968, and told her in the same year: ... you do personify Europe to me. Marthe was 82 years old. She died on 28 November 1973 in Paris. In January 2001, a national poll of the most influential women in Romania's history placed princess Marthe Bibesco in the first position as the woman of the Millennium and of the 20th century.

B. burgdorferi exists in North America and Europe and until 2016 was the only known cause of Lyme disease in North America (Borrelia mayonii, found in the midwestern US, is also known to cause the disease). Borrelia species are considered gram-negative. Microbiology Borrelia burgdorferi is named after the researcher Willy Burgdorfer, who first isolated the bacterium in 1982. Borrelia species is the species complex known to cause Lyme disease are collectively called Borrelia burgdorferi. =Morphology= B. burgdorferi resembles other spirochetes in that it has an outer membrane and inner membrane with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. However, the outer membrane lacks lipopolysaccharide. Its shape is a flat wave. It is about 0.3 Œºm wide and 5 to 20 Œºm in length. B. burgdorferi is a microaerobic, motile spirochete with seven to 11 bundled perisplasmic flagella set at each end that allow the bacterium to move in low- and high-viscosity media alike, which is related to its high virulence factor. =Metabolism= B. burgdorferi is a slow-growing microaerophilic spirochete with a doubling time of 24 to 48 hours. Life cycle B. burgdorferi circulates between Ixodes ticks and a vertebrate host in an enzootic cycle. B. burgdorferi living in a tick can be passed to its offspring (Buhner, 2015). The spirochetes survive as the larvae molts into a nymph and persist in the nutrient-poor midgut as the nymph overwinters. Infected nymphs then transmit B. burgdorferi by feeding on another vertebrate to complete the cycle. Ticks can transmit B. burgdorferi to humans, but humans are dead-end hosts, unlikely to continue the life cycle of the spirochete. Nymphs molt into adult ticks, which usually feed on larger mammals that are not able to support the survival of B. burgdorferi. Disease Lyme disease is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted by the Ixodes tick (also the vector for Babesia and Anaplasma). The infected nymphal tick transmits B. burgdorferi via its saliva to the human during its blood meal. Clinical presentation of Lyme disease is best known for the characteristic bull's-eye rash (also known as erythema chronicum migrans) but can also include myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, arrythmia, arthritis, arthralgia, meningitis, neuropathies, and facial nerve palsy depending on the stage of infection. Characteristic \\"bull's-eye\\" (erythema chronicum migrans) rash of stage 1 Lyme disease B. burgdorferi infections have been found in possible association with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCLs), where a review of the primary literature has, as of 2010, noted that most of the PCBLCs examined have been 'unresponsive' to antibiotics; hence, as in the case of Chlamydophila psittaci association with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the working conclusion was that \\"if B. burgdorferi is truly associated with PCBCL, then there is wide geographic variability and other factors are probably involved\\". Progression of the disease follows 3 stages. = Stage 1 = Stage 1 is known as the Early Localized stage and occurs approximately 3 days - 1 month after inoculation. It affects the local area around the bite and is characterized by local swelling and / or a red \\"bull's-eye\\" rash (also known as erythema chronicum migrans) seen as an erythematous circle encircling a defined center that expands outward. It can get as large as 15 cm in diameter. Once the rash starts to subside the first symptoms can manifest as \\"flu-like\\" symptoms. At this stage, antibiotics are most efficacious to prevent further growth and symptoms of the disease before the major symptoms manifest. = Stage 2 = Stage 2 is known as the Early Disseminated stage and occurs weeks - months after infection if left untreated. The bacteria spreads via the blood through the body to affect the organs. It often presents with general symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy as well as the organ-specific symptoms. It can affect the heart causing myocarditis and arrythmias such as Atrioventricular blocks (which if significant enough may require the insertion of a pacemaker). It can affect the musculoskeletal system causing non- inflammatory transient arthritis and / or arthralgias. It can affect the nervous system manifesting as facial paralysis (Bell's palsy, classically bilateral), fatigue, and loss of memory. = Stage 3 = Stage 3 is known as the Late Disseminated stage and occurs months - years after the initial infection. Effects of the 3rd stage include encephalitis or meningitis. as well as migratory arthropathies (most commonly of the knee). Anaplasmosis and babesiosis are also common tick-borne pathogens carried by the Ixodes tick that infect humans similarly to Borrelia burgdorferi. Consequently, it is possible for an Ixodes tick to coinfect a host with either two or all other diseases. When a host is coinfected, the combined effects of the diseases act synergistically, often proving to cause worse symptoms than a single infection alone Coinfected humans tend to display a more severe manifestation of Lyme disease. In addition, they tend to acquire a wider range of secondary symptoms, such as influenza-like symptoms. More studies and research must be done to determine the synergistic effect of co-infection and its effect on the human body. =Variation of severity= So far, there are three factors that may contribute to the severity of the clinical manifestation of Lyme Disease. The presence of ribosomal spacers, plasmids, and the outer surface protein C (OspC) are indicators of the severity of the infection. Additionally, humans, themselves, vary in their response to the infection. The variation in response leads to different clinical manifestations and different infections to different organs. Molecular pathogenesis After the pathogen is transmitted, it will acclimate to the mammalian conditions. Borrelia burgdorferi will change its glycoproteins and proteases on its plasma membrane to facilitate its dissemination throughout the blood. While infecting, B. burgdorferi will express proteins that will interact with endothelial cells, platelets, chondrocytes, and the extracellular matrix. This interaction inhibits proper function of the infected areas, leading to the pathological manifestations of Lyme disease. In response, the host will initiate an inflammatory response to attempt to remove the infection. Borrelia burgdorferi, also, expresses at least seven plasminogen binding proteins for interference of factor H at the activation level. This is part of a complement system evasion strategy that leads to downstream blocking of immune response. In addition, Borrelia burgdorferi has a strategy to directly inhibit the classical pathway of complement system. A borrelial lipoprotein BBK32, expressed on the surface of Borrelia burgdorferi, binds the initiating protease complex C1 of the classical pathway. More specifically, BBK32 interacts with C1r subunit of C1. C-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein mediates the binding. As a result, C1 is trapped in an inactive form. Garcia, B.L., Zhi, H., Wager, B., H√∂√∂k, M. & Skare, J.T. 2016, \\"Borrelia burgdorferi BBK32 Inhibits the Classical Pathway by Blocking Activation of the C1 Complement Complex\\", PLoS Pathogens, vol. 12, no. 1 Genetics B. burgdorferi (B31 strain) was the third microbial genome ever sequenced, following the sequencing of both Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium in 1995. Its linear chromosome contains 910,725 base pairs and 853 genes. The sequencing method used was whole genome shotgun. The sequencing project, published in Nature in 1997 and Molecular Microbiology in 2000, was conducted at The Institute for Genomic Research. Overall, B. burgdorferi's genome oddly consists of one megabase chromosome and a variety of circular and linear plasmids ranging in size from 9 to 62 kilobases. The megabase chromosome, unlike many other eubacteria, has no relation to either the bacteria's virulence or to the host-parasite interaction. Some of the plasmids are necessary for the B. burgdorferi life cycle but not for propagation of the bacteria in culture. The genomic variations of B. burgdorferi contribute to varying degrees of infection and dissemination. Each genomic group has varying antigens on its membrane receptor, which are specific to the infection of the host. One such membrane receptor is the surface protein OspC. The OspC surface protein is shown to be a strong indicator of the identification of genomic classification and the degree of dissemination. Varying number of OspC loci are indications and determinants for the variations of B. burgdorferi. The surface protein is also on the forefront of current vaccine research for Lyme disease via Borrelia. Evolution Genetically diverse B. burgdorferi strains, as defined by the sequence of ospC, are maintained within the Northeastern United States. Balancing selection may act upon ospC or a nearby sequence to maintain the genetic variety of B. burgdorferi. Balancing selection is the process by which multiple versions of a gene are kept within the gene pool at unexpectedly high frequencies. Two major models that control the selection balance of B.burgdorferi is negative frequency-dependent selection and multiple-niche polymorphism. These models may explain how B. burgdorferi have diversified, and how selection may have affected the distribution of the B. burgdorferi variants, or the variation of specific traits of the species, in certain environments. =Negative-frequency dependent selection= In negative frequency-dependent selection, rare and uncommon variants will have a selective advantage over variants that are very common in an environment. For B. burgdorferi, low-frequency variants will be advantageous because potential hosts will be less likely to mount an immunological response to the variant-specific OspC outer protein. =Multiple-niche polymorphism= Ecological niches are all of the variables in an environment, such as the resources, competitors, and responses, that contribute to the organism's fitness. Multiple-niche polymorphism states that diversity is maintained within a population due to the varying amount of possible niches and environments. Therefore, the more various niches the more likelihood of polymophrism and diversity. For B. burgdorferi, varying vertebrae niches, such deer and mice, can affect the overall balancing selection for variants.

Due to being the father of Jackie Chan, Charles made cameos in some of Chan's films such as Police Story 2 and also starred in his own film once made by a company trying to advertise it as a Jackie Chan film. Their story was made into a 2013 feature film A Tale of Three Cities directed by Mabel Cheung. Charles's biography =Nationalist guard= According to Charles' father, he still needed discipline when Charles returned to Nanjing at the age of 20. His grandfather was a good friend of Chinese National Revolutionary Army General Ku Chu-tung (Gu Zhutong, Chinese: È°ßÁ•ùÂêå) and after displaying his martial arts skills, Charles became General Gu's orderly which was similar to being a personal guard according to Charles. General Gu later became Chief of Staff to General Chiang Kai-shek. General Gu had many armed guards and Charles was also given a rifle of his own. He lost his job as an orderly when he accidentally pulled the trigger of his automatic rifle which startled him causing him to drop it. The rifle continued to fire rounds as it spun on the ground. Charles returned home and eventually found employment on a Mitsubishi cargo ship in Wuhan. =Mitsubishi= Of the seven general maintenance workers in his group, he became the leader. This group of seven also openly traded merchandise without official permits. Linen was especially very expensive in Nanjing, so they bought the linen in Wuhu and shipped it to Nanjing. Once the linen was in Nanjing, it was traded for salt. According to Charles, when Japanese workers arrived in Nanjing to seek employment, they felt they were not given any benefits and accused Charles and his group of smuggling and they were arrested by Japanese authorities. Upon the fourth day of their imprisonment, he and his group had their hands tied behind their backs and were taken to witness an execution. What they saw caused them to literally faint, lose their appetites and experience restless sleep. One week later, they were taken again to witness another execution. Charles, while recalling this horrific experience in the film documentary, Traces of a Dragon: Jackie Chan and his Lost Family, said that he and the other six workers in his group, upon witnessing another execution, became like zombies. =Second Sino-Japanese War= The Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in July 1937. Soon, under the pretext of creating a \\"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\\", the Japanese Imperial Army launched an all-out invasion of South-East Asia, but their primary target was always China. Through political connections, a relative of Charles pleaded with the Japanese authorities to release him from prison. Of the seven workers, only five came out alive, among them was Charles. Deciding to quit his job on the cargo ship, Charles returned to General Gu, who was Dai Li's boss, to ask for help. This time, General Gu got Charles a job in the Intelligence Bureau of the Administration Office as a Secret Agent of the First War Zone. According to Charles, the Nationalist Government was corrupt and currency became less and less usable as even the price of a stick of fried bread (Youtiao) skyrocketed into extremely unreasonable prices. Charles then led his entire unit of 38 men to the headquarters in Shanghai where they all intended to formally hand in their resignations. However, being the leader of this unit made him the target of two assassination attempts, one of which occurred on the way to the headquarters in Shanghai. While descending down some stairs, someone shouted that he had too much power and shot him. The bullet went through the upper calf of his leg. Later, someone shot Charles from behind and this time the bullet took off a piece of his scalp near the crown of his head. Charles expressed that he believes it was Communists who tried to kill him as he was a Nationalist. In the meantime, the Japanese Army were taking the coastal cities of China with overwhelming force causing the Chinese population to continually move further and further inland. Charles fled to Anhui, but it was too devastated from the Japanese air raids for him to stay. Both of his parents and his sister were killed in these air raids. He then fled to Chongqing (Chungking), but returned three or four months later. Living alone among the ruins in Anhui, he met his first wife and they had two sons, Fang Shide (Êàø‰ªïÂæ∑) and Fang Shisheng (Êàø‰ªïÂãù). Eventually, they moved to Wuhu. When the older son, Shide, was seven, and the younger son, Shisheng, was two, Charles' wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and was bed-ridden for three years while in constant pain. Opium, when it could be smuggled undetected by authorities, was often used as a pain-killer, but Charles did not know how to prepare it and hired someone for this task. This caused him to eventually go bankrupt. His first wife died of her illness in 1947. As the Communists and Nationalists clashed, the Chinese Civil War broke out and the Communists eventually won. In the meantime, due to Charles having been a former Secret Agent for the Nationalists, his life was in danger and he felt he had no other choice but to leave his two young sons behind and flee Wuhu. Charles left without telling them good-bye or where he was going. After dodging Communists, he ended up in Shanghai at the age of 29. According to his two sons, when they woke up the next morning, their father was simply gone. Without parents, a policeman found them and the two sons were taken care of secretly by Charles' friends. These friends feared that if they were discovered to be helping the sons of a former Nationalist Secret Agent, they could be arrested by the Communists. Charles expressed that from that day until the day he met them again in 1985, he worried about his sons and wondered if they were still alive. In on of Jackie Chan interview he said that \\"his father was a spy\\" =Death= Charles Chan died at the age of 93 on 26 February 2008 in Hong Kong. Family members, including his grandson Jaycee Chan were at his bedside. His son Jackie was unable to be there due to filming commitments, but he was with his father during the Chinese New Year period and said on his website that he knew that might be the last time he saw his father. Charles Chan was interred next to his wife in the Gungahlin Cemetery in Canberra on 8 March 2008. Jackie Chan, the US ambassador Robert McCallum and former ACT chief ministers Kate Carnell and Gary Humphries were in attendance. Lee-Lee's biography =Early life= Lee-Lee Chan (Èô≥ËéâËéâ; born as Èô≥ÊúàÊ¶Æ (Ch√©n Yu√®r√≥ng)), also known as Lily Chan, was born circa 1916. Lee- Lee's parents owned a grocery store and her first husband worked as a shoe- maker, then later worked at a railroad station. Her first husband was killed from bombs from air raids in Wuhan and at the age of 28, she was left to single-handedly raise her two daughters, Yulan (who was 12 years old when her father died) and Guilan (four at the time). Lee-Lee left Wuhan for lack of money, went to Shanghai at the age of 29 and at the train station, she told her daughters that she would be back. According to Guilan, she told this lie so that they would not feel sad. Yulan, at 12 years old, had to work in a child labour factory to help her grandmother to care for herself and her sister. =Shanghai= While in Shanghai, Lee-Lee heard that trafficking opium was lucrative, so she took a risk and bought some opium. That day, the port was under inspection and the officer in charge of inspecting every passenger was Charles who found the opium Lee-Lee was concealing. He confiscated it and was about to arrest her however, he took pity on her when he noticed the blue flower in her hair. According to the autobiography, I Am Jackie Chan; My Life in Action, during the war in China, a white flower in one's hair signified that one had lost their parents, a blue flower meant that they lost their children and/or husband. Charles asked Lee-Lee about her situation and on hearing it, he let her go, returning the opium back to her. Lee-Lee turned to gambling, successfully. She won so many times, that all over Shanghai, she was known as \\"Big Sister\\" and was treated with utmost respect. However, her luck eventually changed and she resorted to pawning all of her jewellery and clothes. Meanwhile, she and Charles had become great friends, and when he found out about her pawning her belongings, he got them all back for her. He also belonged to a street gang called the \\"Shandong Gang\\". Lee-Lee never gambled again, but her friendship with Charles grew stronger. By studying English, Lee-Lee found employment as a maid in a foreigner's home and worked extremely hard. =Death= Lee-Lee Chan died on 28 February 2002, in Canberra, Australia aged around 85 and was buried in the Gungahlin Cemetery. Flight from China The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong. Many Nationalists fled to Taiwan or Hong Kong. Charles, to further hide from the Communists, changed his name from Fang Daolong to Chan Zhiping, the surname Chan was much more common and was also Lee-Lee's surname, and he joined the exodus to Hong Kong. Lee-Lee arrived in Hong Kong a couple of years later in 1951. A friend of Charles found him employment at the French Consulate in Hong Kong. Charles did not know how to cook at that time, and became an odd job man; doing things from cleaning to gardening. After a while of physical labour with little pay, he asked to be taught how to cook. Charles became a chef at the French Embassy which earned him a higher salary. Charles and Lee Lee had since found each other in Hong Kong and on 7 April 1954, they had a son named, Kong-sang Chan (which means, \\"born in Hong Kong\\" Chan), better known as Jackie Chan. The family of three lived in the servants quarters of the French Embassy. Lee-Lee had found employment there as a maid. According to countless sources, Jackie was a mischievous child who did not like school. At the age of 7, he was enrolled for the maximum 10 years at the China Drama Academy under the cruel Dickensian head teacher, Master Yu Jim- Yuen where he learned the skills of Chinese Opera such as martial arts, acrobatics, singing and dancing with very little emphasis on academics. The 1960s were still financially challenging in Hong Kong and when Charles had the opportunity to leave there with Charles Greene, the Marshall of the French Embassy, to become a chef at the US Embassy in Australia, he did not hesitate to take the new position. After he had earned enough money for an airline ticket for Lee-Lee, he sent for her which meant that after she joined him Australia and also found employment at the US Embassy as a maid, Jackie was left in the care of Master Yu Jim-Yuen. After Jackie graduated from the China Drama Academy, Charles bought him an apartment in Hong Kong. According to Charles, it cost he and Lee-Lee all of their savings plus tips. When Jackie learned of this, his resentment towards his parents for leaving him behind in Hong Kong disappeared as he realised they were working so hard for their son and his future. In 1985, through the help of a friend who worked at the Chinese Embassy in Australia, who was also from Shandong, China, Charles found his two sons in China. They were living in Wuhan in Hubei province. Their reunion took place in Guangzhou, China and the sons cried upon seeing their father again and they said that they had suffered a lot. The older son, Shide, is a postman, and the younger son, Shisheng, works on a pig farm. Charles visited his two sons and their families in Anhui as often as he was able to (at 89 years old in 2005) and he re-established his position as the patriarch of the Fang family and provided money to renovate the ancestral hall there.

Born in Liverpool, he began working as a television journalist in New Zealand in the early 1970s. A passionate music fan (and, during his youth, a drummer), he soon began making his reputation with eccentric interviews of top musicians which came as close to gonzo journalism as New Zealand had known. Among his more notable interview subjects were Bob Marley and Lou Reed. Trying to separate the truth from the myth in Taite's career is difficult, but he was as highly regarded by musicians as by the public and was able to gain access to frank interviews with normally reticent stars. His interviews of Bob Marley (while playing games of soccer) are regarded as the best the reggae musician ever gave. Taite is also reputed to have been behind some of the publicity stunts connected with Malcolm McLaren's time as manager of The Sex Pistols. One of the ideas Taite is said to have given to Malcolm McLaren was that the Sex Pistols should sign their contract to EMI outside Buckingham Palace. Taite was involved in a car accident in December 2002. Although he did not appear badly injured at the time, his health deteriorated, and he lapsed into a coma the following month.

Theo Kelly (17 January 1896 ‚Äì 30 April 1964) was manager of Everton Football Club from 1939 to 1948. Biography Theo Kelly was born Louis Alford Theodore Kelly in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on 17 January 1896. His father, Louis Theophilus Kelly, was Manx. His mother, Lilian Mabel May, was Cornish. Theo Kelly married Emily Gladys Wilson at Walton Methodist Chapel, County Road, Liverpool in 1925. He joined Everton F.C. as a coach in 1929. He is best known for being the first manager of Everton F.C.ToffeeWeb.Ancestry.Lancashire BMD. Pre-war Everton were one of the last league teams to appoint a manager. Before this, the team selection was made by coaches and boardroom members. Theo Kelly had been club secretary before his appointment as manager in May 1939 and had been closely involved in team matters, so there is some dispute when he actually took over. Kelly was ambitious and a self-publicist, manoeuvring himself into the position after the untimely death of his successful predecessor, Thomas H. McIntosh. While he was club secretary Theo Kelly devised the club badge and motto. The Football League First Division of 1938-39 had already been won by Everton by the time that Kelly was appointed as full-time manager. The League was then suspended for seven seasons during the war though some matches were played with Kelly in charge. Post-war After the war Kelly disagreed with Joe Mercer. Kelly accused Mercer of not trying in an international against Scotland, but in reality Mercer had sustained a severe cartilage injury. Even after consulting an orthopaedic specialist, Kelly refused to believe him and Mercer had to pay for the surgery himself (after 14 years with the club). Understandably upset, Mercer moved in 1946 for ¬£9,000 to Arsenal, although he commuted from Liverpool. Theo Kelly brought Mercer's boots to the transfer negotiations to prevent Mercer having a reason to go back to say goodbye to the other players at Everton. Kelly was also unable to persuade Tommy Lawton to stay and he attempted to sell T. G. Jones to A.S. Roma to raise ¬£15,000, but exchange control prevented the transfer. Many players saw Kelly as a remote, autocratic and petty figure. Dixie Dean said that the main reason for leaving Everton in 1937 was Theo Kelly. Kelly distrusted players bought on the transfer market and so the playing resources were quickly depleted. After two poor seasons (finishing 10th and 14th) and a poor start to the 1948-49 season in which Everton finished 18th, Kelly resigned as manager in September 1948 and reverted to being club secretary. Cliff Britton replaced him as manager, though relegation in 1950/51 can be partly traced back to Kelly's period as manager. Kelly was better known for his administrative skills and to his credit he left the club in a better financial state.

It derives from the work of Eddie Gray and David O. Tall, and is a much used construct in mathematics education research. The notion was first published in a paper in the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education in 1994, and is part of the process-object literature. This body of literature suggests that mathematical objects are formed by encapsulating processes, that is to say that the mathematical object 3 is formed by an encapsulation of the process of counting: 1,2,3... Gray & Tall's notion of procept improved upon the existing literature by noting that mathematical notation is often ambiguous as to whether it refers to process or object. Examples of such notations are: :3+4 : refers to the process of adding as well as the outcome of the process. :\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}(a_n) : refers to the process of summing an infinite sequence, and to the outcome of the process. :f(x)=3x+2 : refers to the process of mapping x to 3x+2 as well as the outcome of that process, the function f(x).

He made a substantial contribution to the literary genre of political biography. Early life Pimlott was born on 4 July 1945. His father was John Pimlott, a civil servant at the Home Office and former private secretary to Herbert Morrison. He was educated at Rokeby School (at the time in Wimbledon), Marlborough College and Worcester College, Oxford, where he took a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and a BPhil in politics, having originally won a scholarship to study there. In 1970, he was appointed as a lecturer in the politics department of the University of Newcastle, where he also took his PhD. In the February 1974 general election, Pimlott contested Arundel on behalf of the Labour Party, and Cleveland and Whitby the following October. Having lost on both occasions, he also contested the 1979 election, after which he left the North East to take up a research post at the London School of Economics, moving to a lectureship at Birkbeck College, London in 1981.Kenneth O. Morgan Obituary: Ben Pimlott, The Guardian, 12 April 2004 Writing During 1987‚Äì88, he was Political Editor of the New Statesman magazine and took on the post of Professor of Contemporary History at Birkbeck in 1988. For the following two years, Pimlott was responsible, with friends, for the short-lived journal Samizdat. Aside from his attempts at a Parliamentary career in the 1970s, not to mention his tenure as Chairman of the Fabian Society in 1993/1994, Pimlott is best remembered for his works of political biography including lives of Hugh Dalton (1985), Harold Wilson (1992), and a study of Queen Elizabeth II (1996). His study of Dalton won him the Whitbread Prize. His other books include Labour And The Left In The 1930s (1977), The Trade Unions In British Politics (with Chris Cook, 1982), Fabian Essays In Socialist Thought (1984), The Alternative (with Tony Wright and Tony Flower, 1990), Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks (1994) and Governing London (with Nirmala Rao, 2002). Views and legacy Many of Pimlott's theses have stood the test of time, even if they were marginally controversial when originally published. His studies of the 1930s Labour left, the life of Harold Wilson and the constitutional effect of the monarchy in post-war Britain are said to have made his reputation as a biographer and even bestowed some additional credibility upon the subjects, all of which have received critical accounts under the pen of others. Pimlott sincerely believed and argued consistently that the post-war consensus in British politics was a red- herring. In 1996 his works were recognised with a Fellowship of the British Academy. At the time of his death from leukemia in 2004, he was Warden of Goldsmiths, University of London (since 1998). He was married to Jean Seaton, who lectures on communications and the media at the University of Westminster. In 2005 the college named a major new Will Alsop-designed building on its New Cross site in his honour and also the same year the Fabian Society and The Guardian inaugurated the first annual Ben Pimlott Prize for Political Writing.

She grew up in Sundsvall and started to sing in choirs at an early age, working, among others, with Swedish conductor Kjell L√∂nn√•. By the end of the 1980s she toured with the group \\"Just For Fun\\". Career Her career as a performer of musical theatre began with small-scale concert presentations of Chess, in which she sang the role of Florence. She took part in a number of smaller productions, including Little Dorrit in Enskede and the musical Elvira Madigan at Malm√∂ Music Theatre in Malm√∂, Sweden. Her big breakthrough occurred in 1995 when she created the title role in Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus' Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la, which she played on and off for nearly four years (during the musical's entire run). Minneapolis Star and Tribune in its review of the concert version of the musical performed by the original cast in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1996 described her as \\"extraordinary\\" (14 October 1996, page 05B). In 1998, she played Hodel in Fiddler on the Roof, taking a break from Kristina. In 2000, she returned to Malm√∂ Music Theatre to portray the role of Fantine in Les Mis√©rables, and in 2002 she created the role of Florence in the reconceived Swedish production of Chess, opposite original London star Tommy K√∂rberg as Anatoly. Having left this production upon closing in 2003, Sj√∂holm took part in Chinarevyn, a revue starring many well-known Swedish performers including Magnus H√§renstam, Lasse Berghagen, Loa Falkman, Sissela Kyle and herself. Helen Sj√∂holm has also toured extensively throughout Sweden with Georg Wadenius and Martin √ñstergren and she has released two albums, Visor (2002) (a collection of more or less well-known Swedish folk songs in new arrangements by √ñstergren) and Genom varje andetag (2003) (featuring music and lyrics by jazz pianist Anders Widmark). She first appeared on the big screen in 1999, appearing in D√§r regnb√•gen slutar by Richard Hobert. In 2004, she returned to the movies, portraying the role of Gabriella in Kay Pollak's much- debated S√• som i himmelen (As It Is in Heaven). Sj√∂holm singing with Benny Anderssons Orkester in Minnesota, 2006 She is also a frequent performer with Benny Andersson's band, Benny Anderssons Orkester (BAO), singing mostly dance music and music by Andersson. Additionally, she has appeared in numerous gala concerts including Rhapsody in Rock. On 4 July 2009, Helen performed as lead female singer with the Benny Andersson Band (the name by which BAO is known outside Sweden) at a free concert on Hampstead Heath in London to mark Sweden's presidency of the EU. The concert comprised a mixture of BAO classics, traditional Swedish folk, Bach, Shostakovich, old British pub singalong Roll Out the Barrell, ABBA and even Cadillac by the Hep Stars. An English album by the Benny Andersson Band was released on 6 July 2009 with some of the Swedish original songs having been translated into English and a new song (Story of a Heart) which is also the title of the album. The song was first played on 25 May 2009 on BBC Radio 2 on The Ken Bruce show presented by Zo√´ Ball and after received significant airplay on the station, including being added to the station's A-list. On 11 June 2009, it was announced that Helen would perform in the English version of Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la (outside Sweden called Kristina) in a concert version of the musical at Carnegie Hall, New York, on 23 and 24 September 2009. She sang as her previous title character while Russell Watson sang as Karl Oskar. She received standing ovations on both nights for her rendition of You Have to Be There (Du m√•ste finnas). The concerts themselves in the main received rave reviews, with a CD release of the live recording issued in May 2010. Hit recordings include \\"Du m√•ste finnas\\" (\\"You Have to Be There\\") from the symphonic musical Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la (Kristina), \\"V√•r sista dans\\" (\\"If this is Our Last Dance\\") with Benny Andersson's orkester, \\"Gabriellas s√•ng\\" (from film S√• som i himmelen a.k.a.

They are the Dragon of Revelation, and are destined to bring about the end of the world. Though the Ogdru Jahad are the central antagonists of the franchise, they are not themselves active, their release from imprisonment instead being the object of many other villains' plans. They were imprisoned in their Golden Cocoons by the Right Hand of Doom shortly after the creation of Earth, but not before they spawned 369 children, known as the Ogdru Hem. Fictional character biography Mostly inspired by the Great Old Ones of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos (with some ancient Egyptian and Babylonian influences as well) the Ogdru Jahad are serpentine/crustacean entities which once resided on, and presided over, Earth. They are pitiless, chaotic, bent on destruction and subjugation and often so horrific in appearance that the mere sight of one of them sometimes induced madness. They are listed as follows:Hellboy: Seed of Destruction. *Amon-Jahad *Adad-Jahad *Namrat-Jahad *Irra-Jahad *Nunn-Jahad *Beuu-Jahad *Nergal-Jahad =Origins= In the beginning of time, God created an army of spirits. Of these, many of the greater spirits were sent to newborn Earth to oversee it as Watchers. After a time, one Watcher named Anum \\"...dared to take fire from the air, and with it, fashioned out of mud the dragon (...)\\". The Ogdru Jahad is thus made up of the four classical elements. The other Watchers set their seals on the Ogdru Jahad and yet the entities did not come to life until nightfall. By then, the awakened Ogdru Jahad are instilled with purpose and function as they instantly give birth to the Ogdru Hem, who become Earth's first lifeforms. The Watchers, upon seeing the creation of these abominations, went to war with them. The Ogdru Hem were eventually all disposed of, with many of them barely clinging to existence in some fashion, with the Ogdru Jahad sealed by their creator in a prison of crystal and placed in the heart of the abyss. The other Watchers, however, turn on Anum and destroyed him. After that, God looked down in fury on what had happened, and exacted his retribution on the Watchers for botching their task: some were cast down into the pit, while others were stranded on Earth to breed monsters. Eventually, lesser spirits were given form by God and took up residence on Earth as the first men, the Golden People of Hyperborea. As it turned out, Anum's right hand survived and was found by the Hyperboreans as it became a holy relic and was attached to a great statue at the behest of their king Thoth. Holding three Watchers captive in a secret garden, Thoth learned the inner workings of the universe and only shared a small fraction of his knowledge to the people. 10,000 years later, Hyperboria's downfall began when Hecate used Thoth to find the Watchers, drain them of their blood, and reveal all their secrets to the people. Though Thoth cursed Hecate in her serpentine form, her actions led to Hyperboria's corruption as they begin to worship the Black Goddess, one of many epithets that Hecate came to be called, and commit atrocities in her name. These actions led to the statue coming to life and slaughtering the many Hyperboreans before finally hurling itself over a cliff. The Last Glacial Period then enables the raise of humanity, the second race, while the Hyperboreans were divided into two groups. While one branch who gave their successors knowledge before departing, those among the Hyperboreans who continue to worship Hecate took refuge underground and became extinct at the hands of their corrupted slaves in their attempt to reclaim their former glory. Anum's hand eventually was recovered and ended up in Hell. As the hand is the key to freeing the Ogdru Jahad from their prison, which would usher in a new and final race of men, it came to be known as \\"the Right Hand of Doom\\". =Hellboy= When Hellboy was born, the Right Hand of Doom was grafted onto the newborn's arm by Azzael before being sent away from Hell and summoned to Earth years later by Rasputin. Hellboy is aware that he must keep the hand, as it would be more dangerous to try to rid himself of it. Attempts have already been made to separate Hellboy from his arm, both to protect the world and to hasten its destruction. Hellboy believes he is the best protection the arm can have. While certain events have made it clear that the Right Hand of Doom is the Key to releasing the Ogdru Jahad, the actions of Herman von Klempt and the monsters suggest that there are other conditions that need to be met. The summonings of the Conqueror Worm and Katha-Hem were meant to lead to the Ogdru Jahad's freedom, yet Hellboy's right hand had no role in these schemes and were thus considered doomed to failure. Even Nimue being possessed by the Ogdru Jahad to serve as their vessel and conduit to prematurely enter the world also ended in failure yet began the series of events that would conclude with the end of humanity. By the end of B.P.R.D, Hell on Earth, the Ogdru Jahad are on the verge of victory, with one of them, namely Nunn-Jahad, landing on Earth, in Argent, Kansas devastating the surrounding area for miles. It immediately proceeded to spawn a number of Ogdru Hem as both the SSS and the B.P.R.D. mobilize to try to fight it. Elizabeth Sherman and Johann Kraus succeeded in destroying the Ogdru Hem but are unable to damage the dragon itself, forcing a retreat. Nunn-Jahad's arrival also connected it to the psychic network that powers The Black Flame. After the Black Flame is defeated, Nunn-Jahad begins moving, bringing with it a storm of fire and lightning. It proceeded to spew out dozens more Ogdru Hem by the hour, overwhelming Liz and Johann's attempts to stymie the tide. The US military tries to fire every available nuclear warhead at it, but without any effect. It eventually passes by B.P.R.D. headquarters and destroys it with a fireball that kills Katherine Corrigan and Panya. Afterwards it was confronted by several Watchers from Hell, who have been summoned by the demon Varvara; however, despite their efforts, the Ogdru Jahad incinerated them. Nunn-Jahad was finally killed when Johann channels the infinite power of Vril to shatter it, sacrificing himself in the process. With its death, Ogdru Hem around the globe cease moving or showing any signs of life, giving the world a bit of a breather. The Ogdru Jahad was finally killed after Hellboy died and the Ogdru Hem took over the world. The Osiris Club used Hellboy's severed right hand to \\"reach out into the void, seize the Dragons in their cocoons, and bring it hurtling toward Earth\\". The impact killed the Ogdru Jahad and all the Ogdru Hem, with the spirits of the Ogdru Jahad being absorbed into the hand and siphoned into the Osiris Club members to make them gods. Hellboy's spirit reclaimed his hand before the transfer could be completed, killing the Club members and possibly resurrecting Hellboy. The prophecy about the Ogdru Jahad burning the Earth and then remaking it anew was fulfilled by Hellboy, Hecate, and Liz. The latter burned everything on the Earth's surface and seemingly killed herself, and Hellboy climbed into Hecate's Iron Maiden form, causing his blood to spread life all across the planet and repopulate it with members of Abe Sapien's species. Hecate and Hellboy presumably ruled over the new world. Motivations From the varied attempts of the comic's villains to free the Ogdru Jahad, it is readily apparent that the release of the Ogdru Jahad is closely tied to the fall of mankind. Whether the fall of man causes the release or quickly follows it is not known with any certainty. All the characters attempting to liberate it agree that the Ogdru Jahad will do something akin to \\"burning the earth to a cinder\\" so it is possible they are all referring to some common vision of the dragon's release but are guessing at how the prophecy is fulfilled. Immortal and vastly powerful beyond description, sometimes referred to as a single entity, the Ogdru Jahad's motivations may be impossible to represent in human terms. As such, the human and quasi-human inhabitants of the Hellboy universe have expressed a variety of opinions on what the Ogdru Jahad desire beyond freedom, which it desires above all other things.Hellboy: Seed of Evil Beyond the basic premise of seeking freedom and then burning the earth, there is much dissent as to precisely what the Ogdru Jahad desire. The aliens that watch the cosmic prison of the Ogdru Jahad apparently perceive Earth as a focal point necessary to maintaining the prison. If the Ogdru Jahad are released, they will destroy Earth and then the entire Universe. Herman von Klempt believes that once man has been destroyed, the three hundred and sixty-nine Ogdru Hem will rise up from their prisons, free the Ogdru Jahad and burn the Earth to ashes.Hellboy: Conqueror Worm Similarly, the Bog Roosh was plagued with dreams in which Hellboy's hand is taken and used to free the Ogdru Jahad, who then burn the earth to cinders.Hellboy: The Third Wish Rasputin, on the other hand, seems convinced that the desire of the Ogdru Jahad is to create a new, perfect world out of the ashes of the old one, where the final race of man will live. He tells Inger von Klempt that her grandfather was unable to see beyond the destruction of the human race, and that a new Eden does indeed await the final race of man. Hecate also strongly implies that there will be a \\"new world to come\\" during a conversation with Rasputin in the Conqueror Worm epilogue, but mentions that she cannot see that far ahead, and that death could await them just as easily. In The Third Wish, the Daoine Sidhe explicitly state that it is prophesied that a new world shall rise from the old due to the Right Hand of Doom. =Mortal agents= After being imprisoned in the void, the Ogdru Jahad turned their considerable forces toward finding a way to escape their confinement and exact their revenge on the world. Since they are trapped in deep space, their contact with humanity is sparse at best. However, since the Ogdru Jahad are supremely powerful psychic entities, they have been able to establish contact with mortals on Earth in to coerce them into doing their bidding. Herman von Klempt In Austria in 1939, the Nazis attempted to open relations with space-borne monsters by sending them the corpse of one of their greatest scientists, Dr. Ernst Oeming, in the hopes that the creatures would use it as a vessel and return to Earth. On March 20, 1939, even though the mission, which took place at Hunte Castle, was interrupted by the arrival of Johnson and a detachment of American soldiers, the launch went ahead as planned. The castle, however, was left in ruins, and all parties were killed except for Herman von Klempt. The creatures received the spacecraft, and responded by placing one of their own inside Oeming's lifeless body. After the events of Wake the Devil, Herman von Klempt is provided with the truth about the Oeming mission and the details of the return of the capsule. The invisible space monsters showed von Klempt the destruction that would result from releasing the worm they had planted within Oeming's body. Once the world had been overtaken by the worm, the Ogdru Hem would be released from their prisons, and they would, in turn, release the Ogdru Jahad, who will reduce the world to ashes. Despairing over the failures of his best laid plans, and inspired by Rasputin posing as the angel of death, von Klempt returned to Hunte Castle and set to work. Von Klempt succeeded in bringing Oeming's capsule back to Earth, and from it rose a massive juggernaut known as the Conqueror Worm. Spewing forth a noxious gas, the worm turned von Klempt's human agents into monsters, then devoured them immediately to feed its insatiable hunger. Only quick intervention by Hellboy and Roger the Homunculus, aided by the ghost of Johnson and a mysterious alien, managed to halt the worm's feasting march. Herman von Klempt watched in dismay as his plans were foiled, only to be grabbed by Roger and heaved off a cliff to his death. But Von Klempt's head survived, retrieved by Landis Pope of the Zinco Corporation before being spirited away by Kroenen and then revived by Varvara. Rasputin After being poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, castrated, and hurled into the icy waters of the Neva, Rasputin was contacted by the Ogdru Jahad. They sent him visions explaining their nature and what they wanted from him, namely, to release them from their prison, help bring about the end of the world, and make way for a new world. Uncertain of how to proceed, Rasputin waited to be contacted again. Eventually, after years of silence and waiting, Rasputin was approached by Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel of Nazi Germany. Recognizing this as an opportunity to acquire the resources needed to establish a stronger connection to the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin joined forces with the Nazis and soon assembled a team of Nazi occultists, consisting primarily of Ilsa Haupstein, Leopold Kurtz, and Prof. Doktor Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. This team was known as Project Ragna Rok. On December 23, 1944, Rasputin and his colleagues opened a doorway into the void, and Hellboy was brought forth, albeit unbeknownst to the Nazis (but not to Rasputin). After this apparent failure, the Allies won World War II and Rasputin and his allies scattered. Rasputin himself traveled to a hidden temple in the distant Arctic dedicated to the Ogdru Jahad. Inside, he sat at the foot of a statue of Sadu Hem for almost fifty years until he was disturbed by Bruttenholm, providing a catalyst for his, and Sadu Hem's, sudden re-awakenings. Ilsa, Kroenen, and Kurtz relocated to the frigid north of Norway and cryogenically froze themselves until Rasputin's return, though they did not revive themselves until after Rasputin's failure at Cavendish Hall. In the film, Rasputin was sucked into the portal and was seemingly destroyed, not to be seen again for 60 years. Only 2 members of the Nazis occultist team, Ilsa Haupstein and Kroenen survived.(hellboy, Film, 2005) In Wake the Devil, while trying to strike back at Hellboy by using Ilsa's connection to a Romanian vampire, Rasputin brings Hellboy into the clutches of the Hecate. Hecate threatens Hellboy with his destiny, and in the end Hellboy prevails. Retreating to the abode of his grandmother, Baba Yaga, Rasputin tries to come to terms with the fact that the Ogdru Jahad manipulated him. He realizes that the Ogdru Jahad were behind his latest venture, though he alone is responsible for the failure. He also must deal with the fact that rather than saving Ilsa, he instead sacrificed her to Hecate, who would use Ilsa's corpse (and the iron maiden that contained it) as her new body. Moreover, Hecate tells Rasputin that he had no hope in trying to awake the Dragon in the events of Seed of Destruction - the only power that can free the Ogdru Jahad is Hellboy's right hand, and Rasputin is nothing more than a tool with which to manipulate and maneuver Hellboy. Upon hearing this, Rasputin loses control and attacks Hecate, who virtually destroys him, leaving nothing more than a tiny shard of his soul for the Baba Yaga to preserve in an acorn shell. Eventually, Varvara resurrected her father, who attempted to free the Ogdru Jahad again. He awakened all the Ogdru Hem around the globe. The creatures devastated humanity, who managed to escape through underground tunnels. Rasputin battled Hellboy, Abe Sapien, and Liz Sherman, killing Abe. He referred to himself as the Ogdru Jahad on Earth and tore off Hellboy's right hand, mortally wounding him. Hellboy transformed into a full demon and snapped Rasputin's neck, killing him for good. Nimue A former love of Merlin before she used his knowledge to imprison him in his grave, Nimue lost her mind and became a devout worshipper of the Ogdru Jahad before the other witches killed her and eventually placed her severed body parts in a box that is buried within the earth. However, during the power vacuum caused by Hecate being removed from power, Gruagach had the witches allow him to revive Nimue to be their new leader. But Nimue exacts her revenge on the witches who imprisoned her and abandoned Grugach as she prepares to wage war on the world. However, Nimue would later learn that she became a vessel for the Ogdru Jahad in their attempt to prematurely enter the world through her. When possessing Nimue, the Ogdru Jahad could speak . During its fight with Hellboy, the Ogdru Jahad seemed very arrogant and considered the world its birthright. It was also very malicious and sadistic, as it purposefully unleashed a storm that killed thousands and taunted Hellboy about his inability to stop it. In this from, the Ogdru Jahad referred to itself as one being. Hellboy eventually managed to kill it using Excalibur. However, he was killed by Nimue's ghost and dragged to Hell. =The role of the \\"Frog Monsters\\"= As the Ogdru Jahad advance their plans on Earth, it becomes evident that they intend to transform humanity into a new \\"final\\" race of man. The attempts are seen in the Frog Monsters that were first seen in Seed of Destruction and then again in Conqueror Worm and B.P.R.D.: A Plague of Frogs, creatures strong enough to overpower Hellboy and can assume human form. Moreover, the frogmen can exert a degree of telepathic influence over their victims, confusing them with illusions and mind-tricks. These creatures also possess souls, that create a corrupting influence on living beings. If they pass on, a creature seems to devour their ectasic spirits. Whether this being is the Ogdru Jahad or something else entirely is uncertain. The frogmen are linked to the Ogdru Jahad, and are being employed to free the Ogdru Hem who were imprisoned by the Watchers at the beginning of time. Once the Ogdru Hem are free, the Ogdru Jahad will follow. Currently, due to the events in A Plague of Frogs, numerous frogmen have escaped the clutches of the B.P.R.D. and are moving across the North American countryside. These nests seem constructed around the purpose of praying to the Ogdru Hem and, in certain locations, obtain relics and items which spawn vicious and lethal Ogdru-Hem-like creatures. Moreover, the frogs have transcended their human limitations and have developed the ability to convert their bodies to biological factories, producing thousands of tadpoles which become monsters. After the events of B.P.R.D.: The Black Flame, it appeared that the monsters have been dealt a major setback but, as seen in B.P.R.D.: The Warning and B.P.R.D.: The Black Goddess, the creatures regrouped and allied themselves with the subterraineans from B.P.R.D.: The Hollow Earth. In B.P.R.D.: King of Fear, it is revealed that the monsters were flawed attempts to create the next race of men with Abe Sapien also learning that he is actually a perfected version of the creatures. At the end of The Devil You Know, Abe Sapien's descendants replaced mankind (Who had left the surface world for the safety of underground tunnels) as the dominant species. In other media =Film= In the 2004 film Hellboy, the Ogdru Jahad were mentioned by name only twice by Rasputin. They were portrayed as indistinct, -like creatures encased in crystal shells. They are referred to by him as the seven gods of chaos who will destroy the world and from its ashes \\"a new Eden will arise\\". At the conclusion of the film, their prisons were shattered and the Ogdru Jahad began their assault on Earth. Before the final lock could be released by Hellboy, he regained his senses and the Ogdru Jahad disappeared. Sammael, a demon in the film, was referred to as the \\"son of Nergal\\"; hinting the monster to be one of the Ogdru Hem through Nergal-Jahad. The giant Behemoth, the \\"god\\" Rasputin answers to and appears at the end of the film resembles the Ogdru Hem known as Sadu-Hem. =Animated= In Hellboy: Sword of Storms, the Ogdru Jahad (or possibly Ogdru Hem) made a cameo as the brothers of Thunder and Lightning. Though not mentioned by name, they were referred to as the \\"Dragons\\".

He only appeared in one game, a 15‚Äì5 loss to the Boston Red Sox while pitching for the Cleveland Indians on September 21, 1922. Hamann co-holds a dubious record which can never be broken; since Hamann faced seven hitters and did not record a single out, he retired with a lifetime Earned Run Average of infinity. Hamann was one of a group of players that Indians player-manager Tris Speaker sent in partway through the game on September 21, 1922, done as an opportunity for fans to see various minor league prospects. Also playing his only ML game that day was first baseman Uke Clanton. For shortstop Chick Sorrells, third baseman Ike Kahdot and left fielder Joe Rabbitt, all of whom had made between 1‚Äì3 appearances earlier in the month, this would also mark the final major league game of their careers. Hamann entered the game in the ninth inning, taking over from Logan Drake, who was also making his major league debut. (Drake would pitch 10 games in the majors, through 1924.) With the Indians already trailing 9‚Äì5, Hamann walked Johnny Mitchell and Ed Chaplin, then hit opposing pitcher Jack Quinn. He followed that up with a walk to Mike Menosky, forcing in a run. Elmer Miller then tripled to clear the bases, and George Burns singled Miller home. Only after Del Pratt followed with another single did manager Tris Speaker pull Hamann, who also threw a wild pitch in what was his only major league appearance. Burns also eventually came around to score, for the sixth and final run charged to Hamann. In addition to his infinite ERA, Hamann holds the record for most batters faced in a career without recording an out.Vass, George. Baseball's Most Improbable Achievements. Baseball Digest, June 2003. His appearance with the Indians was apparently his only one in a pro baseball game; there is no record of Hamann ever playing in the minor leagues. Before pitching for the Indians, Hamann played semi-pro baseball in New Ulm, Minnesota. He died more than a half-century later, in 1973.

Corresponding models of baryons are referred to as quark‚Äìdiquark models. The diquark is often treated as a single subatomic particle with which the third quark interacts via the strong interaction. The existence of diquarks inside the nucleons is a disputed issue, but it helps to explain some nucleon properties and to reproduce experimental data sensitive to the nucleon structure. Diquark‚Äìantidiquark pairs have also been advanced for anomalous particles such as the X(3872).  Formation  The forces between the two quarks in a diquark is attractive when both the colors and spins are antisymmetric. When both quarks are correlated in this way they tend to form a very low energy configuration. This low energy configuration has become known as a diquark.  Controversy  Many scientists theorize that a diquark should not be considered a particle. Even though they may contain two quarks they are not colour neutral, and therefore cannot exist as isolated bound states. So instead they tend to float freely inside hadrons as composite entities; while free-floating they have a size of about . This also happens to be the same size as the hadron itself.  Uses  Diquarks are the conceptual building blocks, and as such give scientists an ordering principle for the most important states in the hadronic spectrum. There are many different pieces of evidence that prove diquarks are fundamental in the structure of hadrons. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from a recent study of baryons. In this study the baryon had one heavy and two light quarks. Since the heavy quark is inert, the scientists were able to discern the properties of the different quark configurations in the hadronic spectrum.  Œõ and Œ£ baryon experiment  An experiment was conducted using diquarks in an attempt to study the Œõ and Œ£ baryons that are produced in the creation of hadrons created by fast-moving quarks. In the experiment the quarks ionized the vacuum area. This produced the quark‚Äìantiquark pairs, which then converted themselves into mesons. When generating a baryon by assembling quarks, it is helpful if the quarks first form a stable two-quark state. The Œõ and the Œ£ are created as a result of up, down and strange quarks. Scientists found that the Œõ contains the [ud] diquark, however the Œ£ does not. From this experiment scientists inferred that Œõ baryons are more common than Œ£ baryons, and indeed they are more common by a factor of 10.

It has two public houses, a church, and a school. According to the 2011 UK Census, Worth had a population of 992. Worth was supposedly first inhabited due to its fertile soils. This then eventually led to the cultivation of the land during the Norman times by the Lords of the Eastry Manor.  History  241x241px According to Hasted in the 18th century, Worth was made up of three boroughs, only one of which making up the current village of the 21st century, Worth Street. In the Gazetteer of the British Isles in 1887, John Bartholomew described Worth as coastal parish and village. During the sixteenth century, the area was known for its redbrick style of housing, however the parish church of St Peter & St Paul's, depicted on the left, shows the signs of Norman work from the twelfth century. = Name = The parish name of Worth is said to relate to the word Enclosure, and incorporates a description of \\"elements and their meanings\\". = Literature = C.S. Forester's fictional naval hero Horatio Hornblower was born in the village of Worth, according to Hornblower's biographer Cyril Northcote Parkinson in The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower. According to Parkinson, the name of the small village varied in the 18th century from Word or Worde to Worth and that a farm called the Blue Pigeons was central to the smuggling business at that time. There is today a Blue Pigeon Inn in Worth. It is said by a local legend that Henry V was returning on 25 October, also known as St Crispin's Day, where he had claimed victory at Agincourt, disembarking at Worth. Here he fell in love with a local \\"ale-wife\\", where they ended up living together at the local inn. supposedly as to why the Crispin Inn (pictured) of Worth is named as it is. = Location = The two maps below depict the same mapped view of Worth, simply one century apart. As is clear by them, mapping technique and quality vastly improved over this period. Photography made mapping a lot more simple and a lot more accurate for Ordnance Survey.203x203px 206x206px  Demographics  = Population = The village of Worth covers an area of 1629 hectares and with the population of 992, it has a population density of 0.61 people per hectare. In 1801, the village of Worth only had a population of 264 people, which rose to 718 come 1961. Population figures peaked to 977 as shown in the 1931 UK Census, however due to the unforeseeable circumstances of World War II, population plummeted and only in the most recent census has the population climbed above the 977 mark. left = Employment = Male employment type in Worth 1881. The majority of workers are employed within agriculture and governmental services, followed by defence of the country. Minimal numbers of workers are professional, or work with textiles and domestic goods.As shown in the graphs to the right, female and male employment in history has been very different. In 2011 in Worth there were 414 people ages 16‚Äì74 in formal employment, with the majority of these being in wholesale and retail trade; and repair of motor vehicles (58), closely followed by those working in education (51). In 2011 Worth had 431 people listed as economically active, which left a total of 272 economically inactive. Despite this only 18 are listed as 'unemployed', as the majority of those who are economically inactive are either retired, students, on long term sick leave, disabled or are carers for other family members.Female employment type in Worth 1881. The majority of females at this time are in an unknown occupation, most likely unemployed due to their gender at this time in history. The largest proportion of employed females are working with domestic goods, and minimal numbers work as professionals, or in agriculture and textiles. = Housing = Within Worth there are 403 households, the majority of these have either 1 or 2 occupants, 106 and 183 respectively. = Social = In 2011, out of the population of Worth, the most common religion is that of Christianity, with 651 Christians, compared to the next highest belief, being no religious views, encompassing 225 people. This is a trend for both which follows the trends of the whole district of Dover. Health in the area is high, with only 82 people out of 992 being in bad or very bad health in the 2011 UK Census. Of the 992 people living in Worth, according to the 2011 Census, 950 of these were born in the United Kingdom.

Counties corporate were created during the Middle Ages, and were effectively small self-governing county-empowered entities such as towns or cities which were deemed to be important enough to be independent from their counties. A county corporate could also be known as a county of itself, similar to an independent city or consolidated city-county in other countries. While they were administratively distinct counties, with their own sheriffs and lord lieutenancies, most of the counties corporate remained part of the \\"county at large\\" for purposes such as the county assize courts. From the 17th century, the separate jurisdictions of the counties corporate were increasingly merged with that of the surrounding county, so that by the late 19th century the title was mostly a ceremonial one. History By the 14th century, the growth of some towns had led to strong opposition to their government by local counties. While charters giving various rights were awarded to each borough, some were awarded complete effective independence including their own sheriffs, quarter sessions and other officials, and were sometimes given governing rights over a swathe of surrounding countryside. They were referred to in the form \\"Town and County of ...\\" or \\"City and County of ...\\", and so became known as the counties corporate. Other counties corporate were created to deal with specific local problems, such as border conflict (in the case of Berwick-upon-Tweed) and piracy (in the cases of Poole and Haverfordwest). In the late 19th century the status of counties corporate changed. By the Militia Act 1882 the lieutenancies of the cities and towns were combined with those of adjacent counties, with two exceptions: the City of London, which retained its separate status, and Haverfordwest, which had a separate lieutenancy until 1974. Then the Local Government Act 1888 created the new status of county borough in England and Wales, with administrative functions similar to counties corporate. Some smaller counties corporate (Berwick upon Tweed, Lichfield, Lincoln, Poole, Carmarthen and Haverfordwest) became part of the administrative county in which they were situated. The City of London retained its previous status. Other counties corporate became county boroughs. In England and Wales counties corporate were not formally abolished until 1974, although the only vestiges of their existence were the right of the city or borough corporation to appoint a ceremonial sheriff; and the fact that the letters patent appointing lord lieutenants still included the names of the town or city. For example, the Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire's full title was \\"Lieutenant of and in the County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Bristol\\". =Ireland= In Ireland, eight counties corporate were extant by 1610. Each had its own grand jury, assizes and county gaol, separate from those of the adjoining \\"county-at- large\\", even though the relevant city or town might be the county town of the county-at-large, in which case the latter's courthouse and gaol would be considered exclaves of the county-at-large.3 Geo.3 c.34 (Ir) s.88 An act of 1788 allowed the same courthouse or gaol to be shared by county corporate and county-at-large.Courthouses and Gaols Act 1788 (28 Geo.3 c.38 (Ir.)) (Dublin city and County Dublin, like the City of London and Middlesex, were outside the assize system but similarly separate jurisdictions.) Where an act of Parliament referred to \\"any county\\" it was doubtful that this included counties corporate, the latter intent being expressed as \\"any county, county of a city, or county of a town\\". Acts of 1542 and 1765 were extended to counties corporate in 1807.47 Geo.3 sess.1 c.43 and County Infirmaries (Ireland) Act 1807 (47 Geo.3 sess.2 c.50) Each county corporate contained rural \\"liberties\\" outside the city or town's municipal boundary; in six cases these were transferred to the adjacent county-at-large in 1840‚Äì2; the exceptions were Galway and Carrickfergus, where the municipal corporation was abolished instead.Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 (3 & 4 Vict. c.108); Counties and Boroughs (Ireland) Act 1840 (3 & 4 Vict. c.109); Dublin Baronies Act 1842 (5 & 6 Vict. c.82) The extant baronies of Cork and Dublin are coterminous with the territories transferred from the respective cities in 1840, while the North Liberties barony is part of the former county of the city of Limerick, whose south liberties were absorbed by pre-existing baronies. The 1842 report of the Select Committee on Grand Jury Presentments of Ireland found none of the counties corporate except Drogheda derived any advantage from their status, and recommended they be absorbed as baronies of the adjoining county-at-large. The counties corporate were explicitly abolished in 1899 under the terms of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford became county boroughs. Carrickfergus, Drogheda, Galway and Kilkenny became parts of administrative counties.A Handbook of Local Government in Ireland (1899) p.51 The baronies of Carrickfergus and Galway are coterminous with the former corporate counties.

The 1604 charter incorporated the city and liberties as the \\"city and county of Derry\\". The 1836 report of the commissioners on municipal corporations in Ireland said \\"the charter does not appear ... to have been further acted upon\\"; however, in 1609, the commissioners who planned for the Plantation of Ulster held assizes in the \\"ruined city of Derry\\", separate from those of County Donegal to the west and County Coleraine to the east, and John Davies called it \\"this little county\\".

Political career Al-Muizz ascended the throne as a minor following the death of his father Badis ibn Mansur, with his aunt, Umm Mallal, acting as regent. In 1016 there was a bloody revolt in Ifriqiya in which the Fatimid residence Al-Mansuriya was completely destroyed and 20,000 Shiites were massacred. The unrest forced a ceasefire in the conflict with the Hammadids of Algeria, and their independence was finally recognized in 1018. Al-Muizz took over the government in 1022 following the overthrow of his aunt. The relationship with the Fatimids was strained, when in 1027 they supported a revolt of the Zanatas in Tripolitania which resulted in permanent loss of control of the region. His son Abdallah shortly ruled Sicily in 1038-1040, after intervening with a Zirid army in the civil war that broke out in the island. The political turmoil notwithstanding, the general economic wellbeing initially made possible an extensive building programme. However, the kingdom found itself in economic crisis in the 1040s, reflected in currency devaluation, epidemic and famine. This may have been related to the high level of tribute which the Zirids were compelled to pay annually to the Fatimids (one million gold dinars a year). When al-Muizz (under the influence of Sunni jurists in Kairouan, growing Sunni public pressure in his realm and a violent backlash against the Shi'ite minority) recognised the Abbasids in Baghdad as rightful Caliphs in 1045 and adopted Sunni orthodoxy, the break with the Fatimids was complete. He even denounced the Fatimids and their followers as heretics in newly minted coinage. The Fatimids then sent a military campaign composed of Bedouin tribes of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym from Egypt to Ifriqiya. The invasion of the Bedouin (1051‚Äì1052) led to great hardship after the defeat at Jabal Haydaran, severely impacting agriculture in Ifriqiya. The Fatimids dispatched Makin al-Dawla to rally the Bedouin invaders and duly besiege al-Muizz in Kairouan and conquer Gabes and much of Ifriqiya‚Äôs hinterlands in 1053‚Äì1054. The conquest of Kairouan in 1057 resulted in further anarchy. The Zirids lost control over the hinterland and were only able to retain the coastal areas, the capital being moved to Mahdia. With the growth of Bedouin Emirates and the continuing insecurity inland, the economy of Ifriqiya looked increasingly towards the Mediterranean, with the result the coastal cities grew in importance through maritime trade and piracy. Al-Muizz was succeeded by his son Tamim ibn Muizz. Attributed works Arabic gum resin. He is usually thought to be the author of the famous Kitab \`umdat al-kuttab wa \`uddat dhawi al-albab (Staff of the Scribes).

The findings are published on a monthly basis and made available on the internet with a one-month delay (since 1998). Each monthly report focuses on a specific topic, with certain topics recurring in regular intervals. An abridged English-language newsletter, entitled \\"Polish Public Opinion\\" and containing summaries of results on various topics, is also available online and free of charge.

Quasi-finite morphisms were originally defined by Alexander Grothendieck in SGA 1 and did not include the finite type hypothesis. This hypothesis was added to the definition in EGA II 6.2 because it makes it possible to give an algebraic characterization of quasi-finiteness in terms of stalks.

The pre-duplication bridge as seen from the west and north (Onehunga). The new bridge is on the opposite side. MƒÅngere Bridge, officially also called the Manukau Harbour Crossing, is a dual motorway bridge over the Manukau Harbour in south-western Auckland, New Zealand, crossing between the suburb also known as MƒÅngere Bridge (southern side) and the suburb of Onehunga (northern side). The older portion of the bridge, completed in 1983, carries a four-lane motorway with a cycle and pedestrian path suspended under the western side. By 2000, this bridge was carrying 80,000 vehicles daily and had become prone to congestion. In 2010, a duplication of the 1983 bridge was opened on its eastern side. This doubled the number of general traffic lanes to eight and provided an additional two for buses, for a total capacity of 10 lanes across the harbour. The project had been delayed by disagreements over design and funding, and over the scope of the bridge project and an associated interchange ‚Äì with the interchange being scaled down after concerns from the local community. Original bridges ;Initial bridge The initial bridge in this location was built of timber and designed by the Reverend Dr Arthur Guyon Purchas and was opened in January 1875. Rather narrow, it also soon began to be attacked by shipworms, and in 1910, more than 30 of the piles had been replaced, as well as the decking.Appendix 11 ‚Äì Archaeological and Heritage Assessment (Opus for Transit New Zealand, May 2006, Page 23-26. Accessed 12 June 2008.) The bridge was also single-lane, and so narrow, even pedestrians could barely pass a vehicle safely. The bridge was eventually considered structurally unsound and closed in 1914,Manukau Harbour Crossing, January 2009 ‚Äì NZ Transport Agency newsletter. Accessed 9 August 2009. before being fully demolished. ;Old Mangere Bridge In January 1914 (1915 in some sources), a long replacement bridge was opened. Designed by R.F. Moore, the designer of Grafton Bridge, it was also built by the same company, the Ferro-Concrete Company of Australasia (in a time when almost all bridges in the country were being built by the Public Works Department). This ferro-concrete bridge with driven concrete piles was considered a substantial engineering achievement in its time. With a width of 11.6m, it allowed for a double tram track. The bridge however did not provide for enough clearance to let anything but small boats pass under it. In World War II, an anti-tank road block was erected on the bridge near the middle of the spans, with a small sentry shelter close by. These structures were later removed, and it is unclear whether the bridge had also been mined. However, the bridge soon proved to have too little capacity, and sinking foundation piles created issues. The bridge was closed in 1983 to motor vehicles and is slowly deteriorating, especially after it sustained damage when a ship accidentally rammed it some years ago. A second ship, the 300 ft container transport Spirit of Resolution, also crashed into the bridge on 8 October 2005 as it attempted to leave a nearby Port of Onehunga berth during winds estimated later as being between 30‚Äì40 knots (with stronger gusts) and against a strong incoming tide. The collision occurred despite the ship's bow thrusters working at full power and a small harbour tug assisting.Accident Report ‚Äì Collision with Bridge, Spirit of Resolution (from the Maritime New Zealand Investigation Report, October 2005. Accessed 12 June 2008.) Due to problems with the quality of the concrete and steel, it was initially envisioned that the bridge would be dismantled and replaced by a newly designed footbridge. Due to complaints about this course of action, plans for its removal were not finalised until 2012.New Zealand Transport Authority ‚Äì NZTA welcomes great response for new harbour link in Auckland Construction of a replacement structure, designed for walking, cycling and fishing, was scheduled for 2015, the centenary of the opening of the old bridge. Old Mangere Bridge Replacement Plans The New Zealand Transport agency is planning to begin construction on a bridge to replace the Old Mangere Bridge in 2019. The new bridge will be built on the same abutments as the previous bridge however it will be built further from the port and allow enough clearance for small boats to pass underneath. The planned bridge will be at least eight metres wide and up to 12 metres wide in some bays to enable fishing activities. ;Motorway Bridge The older portion of the current Mangere Bridge was opened in 1983, and now carries approximately 80,000 vehicles a day. This motorway bridge took 8 years to build, including a 2¬Ω-year stoppage due to industrial action and other delays. A duplication of the 1983 structure, to increase capacity, was completed in 2010 at a cost of $230 million. It is 650 metres long and provides four southbound lanes (the same number as the 1983 bridge, which was made northbound only), and two (shoulder) bus lanes. One of the lanes is dedicated to local connectivity between Onehunga and the Mangere Bridge suburb only. The total capacity across the harbour is 10 lanes. Bridge duplication The new bridge being constructed on the eastern side of the existing bridge. =Project history= ;Initial funding On 17 May 2006, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced in the Budget that funds were being allocated to Land Transport New Zealand, to help the National Land Transport Programme accelerate certain projects. That included funds for duplication of the 1983 bridge, to its east. The programme indicated that only $2.78 million funding was then approved for investigation of the project, though Transit New Zealand might apply for additional $1.5 million for further investigation of the project. The bridge was at that time expected to cost NZ$330 million.Second bridge project to go ahead: Transit ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Thursday 22 March 2007, Page A11 ;Wider area As a wider part of the Manukau Harbour Crossing Project, the motorway was also to be widened between Walmsley Road in the south and Queenstown Road in the north from four lanes to six lanes. This widening was to predominantly take place to the east of the existing motorway. The Onehunga interchange (known as the Gloucester Park Interchange) was to be significantly reworked, to provide a more logical link with the motorway, and to ease congestion along Onehunga Harbour Drive. A standard diamond interchange was initially chosen by Transit, but after consultation with Auckland City Council this was then reworked into a quarter-diamond design, with the northbound onramp hooking underneath a proposed Neilson Road bridge. As part of that investigation, Transit considered whether it would have been worthwhile to toll new capacity to assist in funding its construction. This could have been in the form of tolling the new lanes along this route, which would have ensured an untolled alternative was available (as legally required), while the tolled new lanes would be far less congested. In mid 2007, Transit indicated that it would not seek a decision on funding the bridge via road tolls before starting work on construction. Auckland Airport had accused Transit of threatening to defer the project if it could not gain backing from the public and local Councils. As the bridge was to be finished for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, further delays would possibly have resulted in the bridge not being completed in time. ;Public transport link In early 2007 Transit indicated that it would be \\"more than willing\\" to develop the duplicate bridge so that it could accommodate a possible future rail link between Auckland City and Auckland Airport, which would be completed by extending the defunct Onehunga Branch line (which was in the funding stages of being reopened for passenger traffic and was in fact reopened on 18 September 2010). The railway currently terminates near the northern end of the bridge. A combination solution was debated which would see a rail link use the same bridge foundations. The change came after repeated lobbying by the Auckland Regional Council, which was of the opinion that Transit's initial proposal to simply reserve space alongside the duplicate bridge for a later, but separate, rail bridge was not acceptable. In September 2007, Auckland Regional Transport Authority proposed to pledge NZ$2.5 million for future-proofing works to ensure that a rail link would be included. The design envisaged the future railway line run on the new bridge piers for part of the distance underneath the motorway structure, thus saving some of the high costs associated with strengthening the bridge to be able to take a cantilevered bridge ‚Äì estimated at around NZ$20 million in extra costs.$2.5 m offer to link airport to Britomart ‚Äì New Zealand Herald, Friday 7 September 2007, Page A11 ;Interchange issues In July 2007, Auckland City Council commissioners gave approval to widening the approach motorway for the bridge through Onehunga Bay, but opposed the new interchange design north of the bridge favoured by Transit, which intended to construct it around 7 m high over Gloucester Park and the Hopua volcanic tuff ring. The Council's preferred version was to build the interchange at ground level with part of the motorway in a cut and cover tunnel. The recommendation, which Transit could have ignored only at the risk of drawn-out legal fights at the Environment Court level (which would probably have delayed the project until after the 2011 Rugby World Cup), was based on the concerns of residents, who feared that the new interchange would increase and cement separation of their suburb from the Manukau Harbour. Partly due to this, Transit New Zealand decided in August 2007 to continue with building the new bridge without including a new interchange for the time being.Bridge okay, interchange axed ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Monday 13 August 2007, Page A4 = Design = Transit New Zealand made provision for a future rail link under both bridges to connect to Auckland Airport, with three of the eight piers constructed strong enough to carry a future rail link. The bridge has 7 piers with a total of 14 columns, and consists of approximately 10,000 cubic metres of reinforced concrete (with the rebar weighing approximately 1,000 tons). Some of the piles were driven 50m deep, to avoid issues with the softer top layers in the Manukau Harbour. The bridge itself consists of single-pour concrete columns and form traveller- constructed balanced cantilever decks. The related works also included widening of approximately 4 km of associated motorway to ensure the new bridge capacity would be utilised. Existing pedestrian and cyclist links on the old 1914 bridge closed to motor vehicles were retained and are connected to a shared path along the Mangere Bridge waterfront reserveDawn breaks on new harbour crossing ‚Äì Hiways and Byways, Transit New Zealand, Auckland Regional Office newsletter, May 2008 via a new walking/cycling bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road ‚Äì linking Onehunga to Mangere Bridge suburb and to the Waikaraka Cycleway. = Construction and opening = Construction of the new bridge officially began on 9 April 2008, undertaken by the MHX Alliance, a combination of the NZ Transport Agency, Beca Infrastructure, Fletcher Construction and Higgins Contractors. Completion was followed by a temporary closure of the 1983 bridge for refurbishment works, and the bridge was officially opened on 25 July 2010, seven months ahead of schedule. This brought the number of traffic lanes available over the harbour to 10, 2 of them bus shoulder lanes. = Ancillary works = A number of works related to environmental mitigation, post-project landscaping or improvement of non- motorway transport links were associated with the project (and either paid for or undertaken by NZTA). These included a 3.5m wide replacement foot/cycle bridge over Beachcroft Road, a new 3.5m wide foot/cycle bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road at the Old Mangere Bridge, an upgraded underpass under the motorway connecting to Onehunga, as well as improved links to the walking and cycling paths along the harbour and motorway edges and improvement works on the Old Mangere Bridge causeway. After finishing work, NZTA reinstated their large construction staging site along the southern harbour front as an open space, \\"passive recreation\\" park with Pohutukawa.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and Bihor under Bijelo Polje in the North, Mate≈°evo in the West to Plav in the East. The tribe (pleme) is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojeviƒái, Moraƒçani, Rovƒçani, Bratono≈æiƒái, Kuƒçi, Piperi and Bjelopavliƒái). Vasojeviƒái is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojeviƒái. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through oral history. Although the unofficial center is Andrijevica in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojeviƒá tribe. These tribes later migrated to the Komovi mountains and the area of Lim. The emigration continued into what is today Serbia and other parts of Montenegro. Though sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru≈æenje Vasojeviƒáa \\"Vaso\\"). It could be clearly seen during the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum with the Vasojeviƒái united opposition. Geography It occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and Bihor under Bijelo Polje in the North, Mate≈°evo in the West to Plav in the East. Origins It is a tradition of all brotherhoods to show respect to ancestors by knowing precisely genealogy and the history of the tribe and a family. This also allows members of the clan to be unite, to act together and always to recognise kin. According to a folk myth, the founder of the tribe was Vaso.I. R. Dragoviƒá, Beograd, 1997 According to one myth Vaso was a descendant of the medieval Serbian Nemanjiƒá dynasty.Bogdan Laleviƒá-Ivan Protiƒá, Vasojeviƒái u crnogorskoj granici, Srpski etn. zbornik 5, Beograd 1903 Vaso's great-grandfather was Stefan Konstantin, the rival King, who was defeated by his half-brother Stefan Uro≈° III in 1322. Stefan Konstantin had a son, Stefan Vasoje, who was brought up at the court of Du≈°an the Mighty. Stefan Vasoje participated in the battles of Du≈°an, and when he had received sufficient experience, he was put by the Emperor as voivode at Sjenica. Stefan Vasoje had a son, Stefan Konstantin II (1342‚Äì1389, known as Vojvoda Vasojeviƒá Stevo in folklore), who participated in the Battle of Kosovo (1389), where he died.Kosovski ciklus epskih pjesama\\"Pogibija Pavla Orloviƒáa i Steva Vasojeviƒáa na Kosovu\\" is believed to be either the grandfather or great-grandfather of Vaso. The legend further alleges that Vaso, one of five sons of Stefan Konstantin II (all brothers are founders of clans), moved to Lijeva Rijeka. After the fall of Smederevo fortress (1459) and the subsequent fall of the whole Serbian Empire, Serbs from Kosovo, Metohija and ≈†umadija fled from the incoming Turks to Bosna and, after its fall (1463), into Herzegovina. Vaso, the founded of the tribe, fled along with these waves of refugees. In 1465 he moved from Herzegovina to Lijeva Rijeka in Zeta (modern day Montenegro). Vaso's descendants gradually expanded to the north-east and inhabited the region by the river Lim called Polimlje ‚Äì the area around the Komovi mountains, Andrijevica and Berane R-J. V.

In modern Montenegro the area of Vasojeviƒái falls into following municipalities: Berane, Podgorica, Kola≈°in, Plav and Bijelo Polje (around 15% of Montenegro).Pribijanje uz roƒëake One of the highest mountains of the modern day Montenegro is named after the tribe: Kom Vasojeviƒáki (2461 metres) and the whole area inhabited by the tribe is frequently called \\"Vasojeviƒái\\". Part of the tribe that stayed free from the Turkish rule lives in the area of Lijeva Rijeka and Andrijevica (Upper Nahija) ‚Äì they are all called Upper Vasojeviƒái. Lower Vasojevici (or Lower Nahija) inhabited the area of Berane. Most of the Lower Vasojeviƒái were within the Turkish reign until Balkan Wars in the 20th century. Tribe members were perceived as noblemen and rarely mingled with common folk ‚Äì people who did not have a common ancestor. Vasojeviƒái called them A≈°ani (earlier also Asa and Hasa)Predanja o zajedniƒçnom poreklu nekih crnogorskih i nekih arbana≈°kih plemena and today this term has come to denote Vasojeviƒái of other origin. In a book \\"Pleme Vasojeviƒái\\" written in 1935, R. Ve≈°oviƒá describes the structure of the Vasojeviƒái. The list of families was exhausting when the book was completed but since then new families may have developed. Sometimes, with the very distant genealogy, slight variations of names, chronology and relationships exist concurrently but there is no doubt among the Vasojeviƒái members which family belongs to which brotherhood, branch and sub-branch. Never has any family questioned the structure depicted below. The brotherhoods of Vasojeviƒái stem from different tribes, of no common kinship and ancestry, which were united under the rule of a central tribe that extended its name to the other clans. History =Early history= The oldest mention of the Vasojeviƒái dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people). The Ragusan Senate report filed by Ragusan merchants dating to October 29, 1444, speaks of the Vasojeviƒái (and their leader VasoVukiƒá 1969, p. 7), living near Medun, in Rikavac, having together with the Bjelopavliƒái and Piperi attacked Ragusan merchants, doing material damage.Da≈°iƒá 1986, p. 154 According to some historians, the fact that the Vasojeviƒái were not mentioned in the 1455 document, points to them having migrated from Upper Zeta.Da≈°iƒá 1986, p. 157 According to the 1485 defter, the Vasojeviƒái and Bratono≈æiƒái were not yet established tribes. =17th century= In 1658, the seven tribes of Kuƒçi, Vasojeviƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Piperi, Klimenti, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice, establishing the so-called \\"Seven-fold banner\\" or \\"alaj-barjak\\", against the Ottomans. In 1689, an uprising broke out in Piperi, Rovca, Bjelopavliƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Kuƒçi and Vasojeviƒái, while at the same time an uprising broke out in Prizren, Peƒá, Pri≈°tina and Skopje, and then in Kratovo and Kriva Palanka in October (Karposh's Rebellion). =18th century= In the 18th century the folklore of the tribe was influenced by the Orthodox millenarianism that had developed during the mid Ottoman era. According to one such folk legend, an elder of the Vasojeviƒái, Stanj, foretold Greek priests the advent of a Serbian messiah, a dark man (crni ƒçovjek) who would liberate the Serbs from the Turks. These myths as part of the official Serbian Orthodox doctrine provided both a de facto recognition of Ottoman rule and the denial of its legitimacy.. =World War II= During the Second World War, the Vasojeviƒái were divided between the two armies of Serb Chetniks (royalists) and Yugoslav Partisans (communists) that were fighting each otherhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ipQ8AAAAIAAJ&q;=vasojevic&dq;=vasojevic&hl;=sv&pgis;=1 (vojvoda Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá formed the most successful Chetnik units out of mainly Vasojeviƒái). As a result, the conflict spread within the tribal structures. The partisans formed a distinct Vasojeviƒá battalion. In battles, against Chetniks and the Fascist Italian army, it routed 200 Chetniks and 160 Italian soldiers in defense of the position of Pe≈°iƒáa Lake during the advance of the Chetniks from Kola≈°in. =Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006= In May 2006, Montenegro gained independence after a referendum on the future of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. However, 72% of voters in Andrijevica municipality, the unofficial centre of the Vasojeviƒái region, voted against Montenegrin independence. It was the second highest result against breaking the state union with Serbia (after Pluzine municipality).OSCE Referendum o drzavnom statusu The People's Assembly of Vasojeviƒái stated many times that, apart from being Montenegrin, all Vasojeviƒái are Serb Milija Komatina, Crna Gora I Srpsko Pitanje: Prilog Izucavanju Integrativnih i Dezintegrativnih Tokova (Montenegro and the Serbian Question: A Contribution to the Study of Integrative and Disintegrative Currents) (Belgrade: Inter Ju Press, 1966), page 171 and, thus, strongly oppose and have always opposed Montenegrin secession from Yugoslavia.Udruzenie Vasojevicia VasoVasojevici za Srpstvo i Jugoslaviju The Montenegrin census of 2003 revealed that 89,81% of the Vasojeviƒái declared themselves as Serb while 9,43% declared themselves as Montenegrin. =2010s= During the War in Ukraine, some locals of villages of Andrijevica, part of the Vasojeviƒái tribe, decided to sell and give up land for free to Russia, stating that \\"we are brothers\\".http://www.rtv.rs/sr_ci/region/vasojevici-nude-zemlju- putinu_475497.html =Brotherhoods= All people of the Vasojeviƒái are descendants of three Vaso sons: Rajo, Novak and Mioman. Hence the three great clans (bratstva) of the Vasojeviƒái: Miomir Da≈°iƒá, Vasojeviƒái: od pomena do 1860. godine, Narodna knjiga, Beograd 1986 * Rajeviƒái * Novakoviƒái * Mijomanoviƒái The local legend has it that Vaso had a fourth son, by the name of ƒêuro, who left home and settled in Crmnica, where he founded the brotherhood of ƒêuroviƒái. The legend also recounts how after the Second Battle of Kosovo, defeated Janos Hunyadi (Sibinjanin Janko in Serbian epic poetry) along with his wounded (according to some traditions already dead) nephew Banovac Sekula retreated to the safety of the high Komovi mountains. There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon.

Summary In a cave under a glacier (the \\"River of Ice\\") in British Columbia, Brent and Lini Waller find a time capsule with treasure, artifacts, and manuscripts from an advanced, pre-Ice Age civilization. Lini seeks to sell the cave contents to the Wittwar Foundation. Benson declines to lead an expedition to the cave. Lini is kidnapped, and a steel needle is pounded into her brain, a pre-Ice Age mind control technique. She leads the Justice Inc. team into several death traps, including a room filled with dry ice and a building that falls on their car. Mac and Josh, sent to locate the cave, are captured by the criminals. Nellie, captured, apparently has a needle inserted in her brain. Flying to the cave, under Lini's control, Nellie strands Benson, Smitty, and Rosabel in a remote location. Benson had planned for a second plane, delivered by a young Canadian pilot, but accidentally crashes it and is captured. The mastermind seeks the ancient cold light technology which lights the cave, removes all the ancient artifacts, and sets an explosion that buries the cave with the Justice Inc. team inside. Benson arranged for the explosion to destroy the criminals, and escapes the cave using ancient advanced technology.

He signed for the Toffees in 1948, but serving his stint of National Service delayed his debut for another three years. During this period he played for the Cheshire Army Cadets team, and it was with them that he was coached by the Everton legend Dixie Dean. It is fairly safe to assume that Dave developed the physical side of his game in this period. Hickson made his debut for Everton in September 1951 against Leeds United, with the Blues in Division Two for only the second season in their history. Hickson was soon a regular fixture in the Everton side. Perhaps the defining moment in Dave's career came in Everton's 1952‚Äì53 FA Cup run. The Blues were still in Division Two, and home wins against Ipswich Town and Nottingham Forest put Everton into the fifth round, where they were drawn with Manchester United. In front of a capacity crowd at Goodison Park, Hickson launched himself headlong in amongst flying boots and emerged with a huge gash above one eyebrow. Hickson was led off down the tunnel, with the crowd fully expecting Everton to play the remainder with 10 men, as substitutes were not yet permitted. He emerged from the tunnel in the second half, greeted by a huge ovation from the crowd, with a row of freshly applied stitches holding the wound together. Minutes later Hickson scored what would end up as the winning goal, then headed against the post and opened the wound again. Despite pleas from both the referee and his captain to leave the field Hickson remained to the end of the game, his blond hair now red, and his shirt the same colour as the United ones. Hickson was also the match-winner in the quarter final against Aston Villa, with a thunderbolt shot from the edge of the box, after starting the move himself behind the halfway line. An epic year for cup ties this, as Everton next faced Bolton Wanderers at Maine Road. Hickson again received a head injury in this game, and was forced to retire with 15 minutes of the game to go. This was not until he'd scored a goal in an improbable comeback from 4-0 down at half time. The final score was 4‚Äì3, with Bolton going on to be defeated by the same score against Blackpool in the \\"Matthews final\\". Everton soon returned to Division One, as Hickson's haul of 25 goals in the 1953‚Äì54 season helped them gain promotion to the top flight. After just one season back in the top flight with Everton, Hickson was sold to Aston Villa for ¬£17,500. He never settled at Villa Park and played just 12 games in a brief stay. He moved next to Huddersfield Town, where he spent a further two years. Although his record at Huddersfield was respectable, Hickson was not content and he was happy to return to Goodison for a second spell in 1957 for ¬£7,500. At least the board made a tidy profit on these deals. Hickson's second spell was not as productive as his first, but his passion & determination remained, and the Goodison Park faithful still worshipped him. When Everton sold him to their Merseyside derby rivals Liverpool in 1959, there was much dissent. Hickson was undoubtedly revered at Everton, but equally despised by the red half of the city. Supporters of the Reds, then struggling in Division Two, would soon be appeased. Hickson scored twice on his Liverpool debut at Anfield, watched by a crowd 15,000 higher than the average that season. Days later Liverpool had a new manager, Bill Shankly. He was instantly impressed by Hickson's style and used him effectively. His return of 21 goals in 27 games that season almost took Liverpool back to the top flight. Another near promotion the following year and a return of 16 goals in 33 would see the end of Hickson's stint with Liverpool. Hickson was now nearing 32 and had to make way for Shankly's new signings. Hickson moved on, via non league Cambridge City, to Bury for a short spell, playing just a handful of games. He headed back to Merseyside in the twilight of his career, with a productive last couple of league seasons at Tranmere Rovers. He was Rovers' leading scorer in the 1962/63 season with 23 goals, at the age of 34. Dave continued after this outside the Football League, playing for Ellesmere Port Town and Ballymena United (player/manager for both), and as a player at Winsford and Northwich Victoria. It is often said of Hickson that he is the only player to have played \\"for all three Merseyside clubs\\". This is wrong for several reasons: two other players, John Heydon and Frank Mitchell, also played for all three of Everton, Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers. But New Brighton were Football League members from 1923‚Äì51 and Bill Lacey and Neil McBain played for all three of Everton, Liverpool and New Brighton. In addition, John Whitehead played for Liverpool, Everton and also for Bootle in their one year as a league team (1892/93), before they were replaced in Division 2 by Liverpool. Playing style His physical approach as centre forward, coupled with his determination soon made him a crowd favourite. Off the pitch, Hickson was a different man, quiet and unassuming, but the Dave Hickson that pulled on a Blue shirt and entered battle every Saturday afternoon was an aggressive character, no quarter given or asked. This aggression would lead to several run-ins with officials, and three sendings-off during his career, but that was his style & the fans loved it. A youthful Hickson with his striking appearance, fully quiffed up with a shock of blonde hair, as was the style of the day, was one of the few things to get excited about on the terraces of Goodison Park. Dave Hickson soon forged a productive partnership with John Willie Parker, with Hickson being the target man. Although his reputation as an aerial threat was well known, Hickson was also a difficult opponent with the ball on the floor, and could produce a powerful shot, which earned him the nickname Cannonball Kid. Death On 8 July 2013, Hickson died after a short illness, at the age of 83.Huddersfield Town His funeral service was held on 25 July 2013 at Liverpool Cathedral.

Heinrich Leutwyler (2012), Chiral perturbation theory, Scholarpedia, 7(10):8708. ChPT is a theory which allows one to study the low- energy dynamics of QCD on the basis of this underlying chiral symmetry. Goals In the theory of the strong interaction of the standard model, we describe the interactions between quarks and gluons. Due to the running of the strong coupling constant, we can apply perturbation theory in the coupling constant only at high energies. But In the low-energy regime of QCD, the degrees of freedom are no longer quarks and gluons, but rather hadrons. This is a result of confinement. If one could \\"solve\\" the QCD partition function, (such that the degrees of freedom in the Lagrangian are replaced by hadrons) then one could extract information about low-energy physics. To date this has not been accomplished. Because QCD becomes non-perturbative at low energy, it is impossible to use perturbative methods to extract information from the partition function of QCD. Lattice QCD is an alternative method that has proved successful in extracting non-perturbative information. Method Using different degrees of freedom, we have to assure that observables calculated in the EFT are related to those of the underlying theory. This is achieved by using the most general Lagrangian that is consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory, as this yields the ‚Äò‚Äòmost general possible S-matrix consistent with analyticity, perturbative unitarity, cluster decomposition and the assumed symmetry. In general there is an infinite number of terms which meet this requirement. Therefore in order to make any physical predictions, one assigns to the theory a power-ordering scheme which organizes terms by some pre-determined degree of importance. The ordering allows one to keep some terms and omit all other, higher-order corrections which can safely be temporarily ignored. There are several power counting schemes in ChPT. The most widely used one is the p-expansion where p stands for momentum. However, there also exist the \\\\epsilon, \\\\delta, and \\\\epsilon^{\\\\prime} expansions. All of these expansions are valid in finite volume, (though the p expansion is the only one valid in infinite volume.) Particular choices of finite volumes require one to use different reorganizations of the chiral theory in order to correctly understand the physics. These different reorganizations correspond to the different power counting schemes. In addition to the ordering scheme, most terms in the approximate Lagrangian will be multiplied by coupling constants which represent the relative strengths of the force represented by each term. Values of these constants - also called low-energy constants or Ls - are usually not known. The constants can be determined by fitting to experimental data or be derived from underlying theory. =The model Lagrangian= The Lagrangian of the p-expansion is constructed by writing down all interactions which are not excluded by symmetry, and then ordering them based on the number of momentum and mass powers. The order is chosen so that (\\\\partial \\\\pi)^2 + m_{\\\\pi}^2 \\\\pi^2 is considered in the first-order approximation, where \\\\pi is the pion field and m_{\\\\pi} the pion mass, which breaks the underlying chiral symmetry explicitly (PCAC).Gell-Mann, M., L√©vy, M., The axial vector current in beta decay, Nuovo Cim **16**, 705‚Äì726 (1960). J Donoghue, E Golowich and B Holstein, Dynamics of the Standard Model, (Cambridge University Press, 1994) . Terms like m_{\\\\pi}^4 \\\\pi^2 + (\\\\partial \\\\pi)^6 are part of other, higher order corrections. It is also customary to compress the Lagrangian by replacing the single pion fields in each term with an infinite series of all possible combinations of pion fields. One of the most common choices is : U = \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{i}{F} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\pi^0 & \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\pi^+ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\pi^- & \\\\- \\\\pi^0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where F is called the pion decay constant which is 93 MeV. In general, different choices of the normalization for F exist, so that one must choose the value that is consistent with the charged pion decay rate. =Renormalization= The effective theory in general is non-renormalizable, however given a particular power counting scheme in ChPT, the effective theory is renormalizable at a given order in the chiral expansion. For example, if one wishes to compute an observable to \\\\mathcal{O}(p^4), then one must compute the contact terms that come from the \\\\mathcal{O}(p^4) Lagrangian (this is different for an SU(2) vs. SU(3) theory) at tree-level and the one-loop contributions from the \\\\mathcal{O}(p^2) Lagrangian.) One can easily see that a one-loop contribution from the \\\\mathcal{O}(p^2) Lagrangian counts as \\\\mathcal{O}(p^4) by noting that the integration measure counts as p^4, the propagator counts as p^{-2}, while the derivative contributions count as p^2. Therefore, since the calculation is valid to \\\\mathcal{O}(p^4), one removes the divergences in the calculation with the renormalization of the low-energy constants (LECs) from the \\\\mathcal{O}(p^4) Lagrangian. So if one wishes to remove all the divergences in the computation of a given observable to \\\\mathcal{O}(p^n), one uses the coupling constants in the expression for the \\\\mathcal{O}(p^n) Lagrangian to remove those divergences. Successful application =Mesons and nucleons= The theory allows the description of interactions between pions, and between pions and nucleons (or other matter fields). SU(3) ChPT can also describe interactions of kaons and eta mesons, while similar theories can be used to describe the vector mesons. Since chiral perturbation theory assumes chiral symmetry, and therefore massless quarks, it cannot be used to model interactions of the heavier quarks. For an SU(2) theory the leading order chiral Lagrangian is given by : \\\\mathcal{L}_{2}=\\\\frac{F^2}{4}{\\\\rm tr}(\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}U \\\\partial^{\\\\mu}U^{\\\\dagger})+\\\\frac{\\\\lambda F^3}{4}{\\\\rm tr}(m_q U+m_q^{\\\\dagger}U^{\\\\dagger}) where F = 93 MeV and m_q is the quark mass matrix. In the p-expansion of ChPT, the small expansion parameters are : \\\\frac{p}{\\\\Lambda_{\\\\chi}}, \\\\frac{m_{\\\\pi}}{\\\\Lambda_{\\\\chi}}. where \\\\Lambda_{\\\\chi} is the chiral symmetry breaking scale, of order 1 GeV (sometimes estimated as \\\\Lambda_{\\\\chi} = 4\\\\pi F).

For instance, it can be applied to few-nucleon systems, and at next-to-next-to- leading order in the perturbative expansion, it can account for three-nucleon forces in a natural way.

He uses a projection technique called anamorphosis to create the illusion of three dimensions when viewed from the correct angle. He preserves his work in photographs, often positioning a person within the image as if they were interacting with the scene. Biography A promotional chalk drawing (2007) Beever grew up in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, near the geographical centre of England. His talent in drawing had emerged by the time he was 5 years old; he liked school, especially his art classes. At the age of 18, he chose to study art, design, and psychology (as a last-minute substitute for English). He continued to excel in art, found design to be tedious, and discovered new insights into visual perception, depth perception, and the eye and brain in his psychology studies. After a gap year working as a laborer and carpet- layer's assistant, Beever enrolled in a Foundation Art course at Leicester Polytechnic, where he enjoyed experimenting with a variety of modern art forms. He started a three-year course of study for a BA in Fine Arts at Leeds Polytechnic, but found the larger school and its self-consciously avant-garde atmosphere mean and unsympathetic. When placed on academic probation, Beever decided to focus on traditional techniques, developing meticulous skills in portraying water surfaces. He later has said that in three years of college, he learned little that could not have acquired on his own, but he did pick up skills in pastel crayons that would become key to his later career. A chance encounter at the 1983 Stonehenge Free Festival with a juggler inspired Beever to take up the skill a few months before his graduation. Overcoming his introversion and shyness, he learned from other jugglers how to flourish as a street performer. He then decided to combine performance with his artistic skills by building and operating a portable \\"Punch and Judy\\" puppet theater, but eventually found the repetitious performances to be boring. He observed street artists at work, and realised that he could use his strengths in drawing, and tour freely carrying only a box of sidewalk chalk instead of a bulky booth and puppets. He had always wanted to travel, and found that he could finance overseas trips by working as a freelance pavement artist. Beever learned how to pick locations and images that would earn him good tips from delighted onlookers. He found a favourite spot in Brussels, Belgium, where he did crowd-pleasing renditions of the Mona Lisa, the Belgian royal family, and the famous Manneken Pis statue. It was there that he made his artistic breakthrough with Swimming pool in the high street, his first major anamorphic work. Artwork Beever at work in Union Square, Manhattan (2007) Beever in Guayaquil, Ecuador Beever begins by sketching his concepts on paper. Once the image is finalised, a camera is placed at the intended location from which the artwork is expected to be viewed. From this time onwards, Beever evaluates his work in progress only through the fixed lens of his camera. He observes the classic rules of perspective, occasionally placing a short piece of rope in the scene to evaluate the curve of a line. He carefully selects suitable surfaces to hold his art. He has written: \\"Good quality pastels used on a good cement or stone surface can give an effect second to none ‚Äì better than on paper\\". Once the artwork is completed, Beever takes multiple photographs to document and preserve his work, often posing himself or other people within the scene to reinforce the visual effect. When he plans to use a wide-angle lens to take a picture from a closer distance, his drawing must be carefully predistorted to compensate for the lens distortion. Beever works internationally as a freelance artist, creating commissioned murals for companies and institutions, and producing hundreds of works across Europe, the US, and Australia. Besides his pavement art, Beever also paints murals with acrylic paints and replicas of the works of masters and oil paintings, and creates collages. Among his other work are drawings, usually themed around music. In 2010, Beever released Pavement Chalk Artist, a book which includes photographs of many of his works from around the world.

This name is also given to a spy at White Sands Missile Range, located further south near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Evidence for his or her existence is based on a few references in KGB archives opened (and later closed) to researchers in the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are also a few references to Perseus in the Venona project, decrypts as PERS. The identity of this person, or even whether or not they actually existed, is unknown, and many of the facts in the matter are questionable.  History  The first person to publicly write about atomic spy Perseus was Russian intelligence Colonel Vladimir Chikov. Starting in 1991, Chikov wrote a number of articles in Russian periodicals that discussed Perseus. In 1996, Chikov published a book with American co-author Gary Kern titled, How Stalin Stole the Atomic Bomb from the Americans (published in France in French). The Venona project messages contain the unidentified codename \\"PERS.\\" Not only is \\"pers\\" the linguistic root of the word Perseus, the messages suggest that PERS was a Soviet source on the Manhattan Project. In addition to this, many other individuals, including some associated with the KGB, have affirmed either the specific existence of Perseus or that there remain unidentified atomic spies on the Manhattan Project. According to Chikov, Perseus was at Los Alamos in 1943, a year before known spy Klaus Fuchs was assigned there, and in the 1950s, Perseus was under the control of Rudolf Abel. In 1999, arms-control advocate Jeremy Stone allegedJeremy Stone, Every Man Should Try: Adventures of a Public Interest Activist (PublicAffairs, 1999) that Perseus was \\"Scientist X\\", easily identifiable as MIT physicist Philip Morrison. This was a sensational claim because accuser and accused were both highly regarded within the same academic community.David L. Chandler, \\"Friendship lost in \`Perseus' quest\\", Boston Globe (June 14, 1999) Morrison denied that he was a spy and pointed out numerous discrepancies between his biography and that attributed to Perseus. While Stone accepted Morrison's denial and apologized \\"for the unfavorable publicity\\", he never fully withdrew the original allegation.Irwin Goodwin, \\"New Book Unmasks Scientist X as Spy, But Facts of Case Tell a Different Story\\" Physics Today, July 1999, Vol. 52, Issue 7, p. 39 U.S. Cold War historian John Earl Haynes believes that Perseus is \\"a faked composite by Vladimir Chikov and the SVR combining part of the story of Theodore Hall with misdirection and distortion.\\"Cover Name, Cryptonym, Pseudonym, and Real Name Index johnearlhaynes.org Accessed: 9 September 2010  In popular culture  On August 19, 2020, Perseus was referenced in the worldwide teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.

It was originally formed in London to promote performances of instrumental music there. Many distinguished composers and performers have taken part in its concerts. It is now a membership society, and while it no longer has its own orchestra, it continues a wide-ranging programme of activities which focus on composers and young musicians and aim to engage audiences so that future generations will enjoy a rich and vibrant musical life. Since 1989 it has promoted the annual Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards for live music-making in the United Kingdom. The RPS is a registered UK charity No. 213693. It is located at 48 Great Marlborough Street in London. The society's Gold Medal for outstanding musicianship is awarded only occasionally. the Society's CEO is James Murphy and it is chaired by John Gilhooly. History In London, at a time when there were no permanent London orchestras, nor organised series of chamber music concerts, a group of thirty music professionals formed the Philharmonic Society of London on 6 February 1813. The idea was that by cooperating, they could build a stronger orchestra than by competing against one another. However, given the organization's choice to hold its concerts at the Argyll Rooms, it is likely that the society was initiated because of John Nash's bold urban redesign of Regent Street. In this way, the society would gain an impressive performing space once the old Argyll Rooms had to be rebuilt due to the Regent Street plan, and Prince regent George IV could promote classical music as a British institution and thereby improve his reputation.Langley, 3. Concerts were held in the Argyll Rooms until it burned down in 1830. The Society's aim was \\"to promote the performance, in the most perfect manner possible of the best and most approved instrumental music\\". The first concert, on 8 March 1813, was presided over by Johann Peter Salomon, with Muzio Clementi at the piano and the violin prodigy Nicolas Mori as lead violinist, performing symphonies by Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Among the founders were the pianist and violinist William Dance (who became the society's first director and treasurer until his death in 1840), composer Henry Bishop, and Charles Neate, a pianist and friend of Beethoven, who publicised Beethoven's music at the Society. The Society asked Beethoven to come to London, but the composer's health prevented his accepting the invitation. However the society's request for a new symphony from him resulted in the Choral Symphony. In 1827 Beethoven wrote to the society outlining his straitened circumstances; at a special general meeting the society resolved to send the composer ¬£100 immediately (; George Bernard Shaw once referred to this as \\"the only entirely creditable incident in English history\\"). Other works written for the Society include the Italian Symphony by Felix Mendelssohn. Distinguished conductors included Ludwig Spohr, one of the first conductors to use a baton, Hector Berlioz, who conducted a concert of his works in 1853, Richard Wagner, who conducted the whole 1855 season of orchestral concerts, William Sterndale Bennett for the following ten years, Arthur Sullivan, and Tchaikovsky, who conducted his own works in 1888 and 1893. From 1830 to 1869, the Society gave its concerts in the concert-hall of Hanover Square Rooms, which had seating for only about 800. The Society decided to move permanently to St James's Hall, and a complimentary additional concert, held at the hall, was given to its subscribers at the end of the 1868‚Äì69 season. Charles Santley, Charles Hall√©, Th√©r√®se Tietjens and Christina Nilsson were the soloists.R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic: The Annals of the Royal Philharmonic Society (Rider & Co, London, 1946), p. 65. When the move was made, the Society remodelled its charges to obtain a wider audience and compete with the Crystal Palace and other large venues, and introduced annotated programmes. The Society remained at the hall until 28 February 1894, when it moved to the Queen's Hall.R. Elkin, Queen's Hall 1893‚Äì1941 (Ryder, London 1944), p. 52. The society became the Royal Philharmonic Society during its 100th concert season in 1912, and continued organising concerts through the two world wars. It is now a membership society which \\"seeks to create a future for music through the encouragement of creativity, the recognition of excellence and the promotion of understanding.\\"R.

History  Caf√©direct was founded in 1991 by Oxfam, Traidcraft, Equal Exchange Trading and Twin Trading as a response to the 1989 global collapse in coffee prices. Its aims was to \\"give coffee bean, cocoa and tea growers a larger slice of the purchase price for the products.\\" Caf√©direct secured its first commercial contract for Co-op and Safeway's Scottish stores in 1992. Very early on, the brand was endorsed by Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short. Caf√©Direct was the first coffee brand to carry the Fairtrade certification mark. The company reinvests about 60pc of its profits into grower training and development programmes. In February 2004, the company released more share floats on the stock market in a move to raise $9.1 million. In 2007, the company's market share for hot drinks equated to 34%, 32%, and 14% respectively of the UK's Fairtrade coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate markets. In the overall market, Caf√©direct is the fifth largest coffee brand and seventh largest tea brand in the UK. In May 2014, Caf√© Direct purchased Kopi, one of the largest coffee subscription services in the UK. In April 2019, Caf√©direct partnered with Waitrose to launch a small batch of premium coffee products.  Producer support programmes  Caf√©direct has established the Gold Standard, a guarantee to pay above the world market price for coffee, and to support the development of producers. Between 2004 and 2009, Caf√©direct paid more than ¬£7.5 million above the market price to growers (including Fairtrade premiums), invested over ¬£3 million in tailor-made programmes to strengthen growers‚Äô businesses, which represents more than 50% of the company's profits and in total, paid more than ¬£10.5 million towards the businesses and communities of their grower partners. In addition to paying a fair price to growers in developing countries, the company donates a percentage of its profits to producers for activities such as market information and management training. Its Producer Partnership Programme (PPP) \\"was set up in 1996 and goes above and beyond Fairtrade criteria\\". In 2007, the company invested ¬£600,000 in PPP and these investments attracted, without additional cost to the company, matched funds of ¬£700,000, meaning growers benefited from a total investment of ¬£1.3 million.

It was essentially the ultimate development of the company's Kestrel engine, which had seen widespread use in military aircraft of the pre-war period. Due to the wartime priority of Rolls-Royce Merlin development and production, the Peregrine saw limited use and was cancelled with only 301 engines being built. Design and development During the 1930s the use of superchargers to increase effective displacement of an aircraft engine came into common use. Charging ‚Äî the compression of the intake air to increase mass flow-rate and oxygen available for combustion ‚Äî of some form was a requirement for high- altitude flight and as the power of engines improved there was no reason not to use it all the time.Gunston 2004, p. 63. The Kestrel used supercharging for boost from the start but by the 1930s it had reached the limits of what its frame could handle in power output. There was room to improve the strength of the engine, which would allow it to run at even higher boost with only modest increases in weight. This improved the power-to-weight ratio considerably and it was generally felt that the design would be the \\"standard\\" fighter engine for the impending war. Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey, started by managing director, Claude Johnson, in 1915 with the Eagle, Hawk and Falcon engines, Rolls-Royce named the engine the Peregrine after the peregrine falcon. The engine was produced in right- and left-hand tractor variants to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller. This was common on German designs but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.Rubbra 1990, p. 53. Four Kestrel/Peregrine cylinder banks attached to one crankcase and driving a common crankshaft would produce the contemporary Rolls-Royce Vulture, a X-24 which would be used for bombers.Rubbra 1990, p. 136. Aircraft designs rapidly increased in size and power requirements to the point where the Peregrine was too small to be useful. Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design, it was never allowed to mature since Rolls-Royce concentrated on refining and producing the Merlin. The Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the Westland Whirlwind and the Gloster F.9/37. The Vulture was fitted to the Hawker Tornado and Avro Manchester, but proved unreliable in service.Lumsden 2003, p. 200. With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the range, the Peregrine was cancelled in 1943.Rubbra 1990, p. 118. Operational history A Rolls-Royce Peregrine-powered Westland Whirlwind The two aircraft types that used the Peregrine, the Westland Whirlwind and the second prototype of the Gloster F9/37, were twin-engine designsthe prototype F9/37 had used the Bristol Taurus radial engine.Bowyer 1984, p. 154. The Air Ministry requirement for the F9/37, a cannon-armed fighter (the Hurricane and Spitfire were armed with machine guns only at this point), was curtailed and there was no further progress with the design. The Whirlwind, despite having excellent low-altitude performance, proved uneconomical compared with single-engined fighters and also suffered as a consequence of the Peregrine's unreliability. Low output of Peregrine engines caused delays in delivery for squadron use.Pugh 2000, p. 263. In August 1940 Ernest Hives, head of the Rolls-Royce aero engine division, wrote to Air Chief Marshal Wilfrid Freeman expressing his wish to stop work on the Peregrine, Vulture and another engine development project, the Rolls-Royce Exe, to concentrate efforts on the Merlin and Griffon but Freeman disagreed and stated that Peregrine production should continue.Pugh 2000, p. 263. While reliability problems were not uncommon for new Rolls-Royce engines of the era, the company's testing department was told to spend all of their time on developing the more powerful Merlin to maturity. As a result of the priority given to the Merlin, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as the Whirlwind had been designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine was not practical. Only 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines were built (301).Lumsden 2003, p. 183.

Today the site is occupied by a former farm called Birdoswald. , it is the only site on Hadrian's Wall at which significant occupation in the post-Roman period has been proven, and it is subject to a long-term archaeological programme under the directorship of Tony Wilmott. It is one of the best preserved of the 16 forts along Hadrian's Wall. The fort is situated in a commanding position on a triangular spur of land bounded by cliffs to the south and east overlooking a broad meander of the River Irthing in Cumbria. In Roman times, the fort was known as Banna (\\"horn\\" in Celtic), reflecting the geography of the site. Cumbria County Council were responsible for the management of Birdoswald fort from 1984 until the end of 2004, when English Heritage assumed responsibility. Layout The fort was occupied by Roman auxiliaries from approximately AD 112 to AD 400. In this western part of Hadrian's Wall, the wall itself was originally built from turf, later replaced with stone (Hogan, 2007). The stone fort was built some time after the wall, in the usual playing card shape, with gates to the east, west and south. Inside were built the usual stone buildings, a central headquarters building (principia), granaries (horrea), and barracks. Unusually for an auxiliary fort, it also included an exercise building (basilica exercitatoria), perhaps reflecting the difficulties of training soldiers in the exposed site in the north of England.  History of excavations  The fort has been extensively excavated for over a century, with twentieth century excavations starting in 1911 by F.G. Simpson and continuing with Ian Richmond from 1927 to 1933 . The gateways and walls were then re-excavated under the supervision of Brenda Swinbank and J P Gillam from 1949‚Äì1950. Excavations between 1987 and 1992 showed an unbroken sequence of occupation on the site of the fort granaries, running from the late Roman period until possibly 500AD. The granaries were replaced by two successive large timber halls, reminiscent of others found in many parts of Britain dating to the 5th and 6th centuries. Tony Wilmott (director of the excavations) has suggested that, after the end of Roman rule in Britain, the fort served as the power-base for a local warband descended from the late Roman garrison and possibly deriving legitimacy from their ancestors for several generations. Extensive geophysical surveys, both magnetometry and earth resistance survey, were conducted by TimeScape Surveys (Alan Biggins & David Taylor, 1999 & 2004) between 1997 -2001. These surveys established that the sub-surface remains in the fort were well preserved. The later surveys detected two vici (civilian settlements) of different characters on the eastern and western sides of the fort. The surveys by TimeScape also determined the location of a bathhouse in the valley of the River Irthing. An area between the fort and the escarpment was excavated by Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team in January 2000. The excavation detected signs of an extramural settlement (vicus), but the area is liable to erosion and the majority of the vicus could have fallen over the cliffs. Defensive location  Hadrian's Wall near Birdoswald The two mile sector of Hadrian's Wall either side of Birdoswald is also of major interest. It is currently the only known sector of Hadrian's Wall in which the original turf wall was later replaced by a stone wall on a different line. When the rebuilding took place (probably in the 130s) the line of the wall was moved approximately 50 metres further north, to line up with the fort's north wall, rather than its east and west gates. The reasons for this change are unclear, although David Woolliscroft (Woolliscroft, 2001) has plausibly suggested that it was the result of changing signalling requirements. At any rate, this remains the only area in which both the walls can be directly compared. Approximately 600 metres east of Birdoswald, at the foot of an escarpment, lies the remains of Willowford bridge. This carried Hadrian's Wall across the River Irthing. The westward movement of the river course over the centuries has left the east abutment of the bridge high and dry, while the west abutment has probably been destroyed by erosion. Nevertheless, the much-modified visible remains are highly impressive. Until 1996, these remains were not directly accessible from the fort, but they can now be reached by a footbridge that was lowered into position by an RAF Chinook helicopter. Maiden Way The fort at Birdoswald was linked by a Roman road, sometimes referred to as the Maiden Way, to the outpost fort of Bewcastle, seven miles to the north. Signals could be relayed between the two forts by means of two signalling towers.

The film is about an aging Pat Garrett (Coburn), hired as a lawman by a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid (Kristofferson). Dylan composed the score and songs for the film, most prominently \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", which were released on its soundtrack album the same year. It was filmed on location in Durango, Mexico, and was nominated for two BAFTA Awards for Film Music (Dylan) and Most Promising Newcomer (Kristofferson). It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of Best Original Score (Dylan). The film was noted for behind-the-scenes battles between Peckinpah and the studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Soon after completion, the film was taken away from the director and substantially re-edited, resulting in a truncated version released to theaters and largely disowned by cast and crew members. Peckinpah's preview version was released on video in 1988, leading to a re- evaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films. It is ranked 126th on Empire magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Plot The movie opens in 1909 (though Pat Garrett was killed in 1908), near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Garrett is riding with men working for the Santa Fe Ring, when he is ambushed and coldly killed by his associates, including one John W. Poe. In 1881 in Old Fort Sumner, New Mexico, William H. Bonney, known as Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson), is passing the time with friends shooting chickens for fun. An old friend of Billy's, Pat Garrett (James Coburn), rides into town with Deputy Sheriff J. W. Bell (Matt Clark) and joins the diversion. Later, over drinks, Garrett informs Billy that the electorate want him out of the country, and that in five days, when he becomes Sheriff of Lincoln County, he will make Billy leave. Six days later, Garrett and his deputies surround the small farmhouse where Billy and his gang are holed up. In the ensuing gun battle, Charlie Bowdre (Charles Martin Smith) and several other men on both sides are killed, and Billy is taken prisoner. As Billy awaits his execution in the Lincoln County Jail for the killing of Buckshot Roberts, he is taunted and beaten by self-righteous Deputy Sheriff Bob Olinger (R. G. Armstrong) while the hangman's gallows are being built nearby. Garrett warns Olinger not to taunt Billy again or he will be fired and sent back to Texas; then, Garrett leaves town to collect taxes leaving his two deputies to guard Billy. Olinger again argues with Billy but after J. W. Bell intervenes, Olinger leaves to get a drink. Billy finds a gun hidden for him in the outhouse and shoots Bell in the back. He then retrieves Olinger's shotgun loaded with \\"sixteen thin dimes\\" and shoots Olinger dead in the street, saying, \\"Keep the change, Bob.\\" Billy leaves town. After Garrett returns to Lincoln and recruits a new deputy sheriff named Alamosa Bill Kermit (Jack Elam), he rides to Santa Fe to meet with Governor Lew Wallace (Jason Robards), who introduces him to a pair of powerful men from the Santa Fe Ring. They offer a thousand dollars for the capture of Billy the Kid, with five hundred dollars upfront. Garrett rejects the money saying they can pay him in full when Billy is brought in and warns them that he will be successful as long as another cattle war is not started. Meanwhile, Billy returns to his gang at Old Fort Sumner, where he decides to lie back for a few days. He is confronted by three strangers looking to kill him; all three are killed in the subsequent shootout, helped by another stranger called Alias (Bob Dylan), who kills one of the men with a knife through the neck. Alias had witnessed Billy's escape from the Lincoln County Jail. Garrett meets up with Sheriff Colin Baker (Slim Pickens), hoping he can provide information on Billy's whereabouts. Baker and his wife (Katy Jurado) go with Garrett to arrest some of Billy's old gang. In a gunfight, the gang members including Black Harris (L. Q. Jones) are killed and Baker is mortally wounded. Baker's wife comforts the dying lawman as he waits to die by a river. Later that evening, Garrett watches a barge floating down a river with a man shooting bottles in the water. Garrett and the two face off briefly from a distance before lowering their rifles. Garrett is joined by a glory-seeking John W. Poe (John Beck), who works for the Santa Fe Ring. The two ride southwest to meet John Chisum (Barry Sullivan), a powerful cattle baron, who informs them that Billy has been rustling his cattle again and killed some of his men; Billy once worked for him and claimed that Chisum owes him $500 of back salary. Anticipating Garrett's arrival in Old Fort Sumner, Billy's friend Paco (Emilio Fern√°ndez) and his family leave for Mexico, soon followed by Billy. Along the way, Billy stops at the Horrell Trading Post, which is owned by an old friend. By chance, Horrell (Gene Evans) is hosting Garrett's new deputy, Alamosa Bill. After they finish eating, Billy and Alamosa step outside for a duel at ten paces, with Billy shooting Alamosa dead. Meanwhile, Garrett and Poe arrive at a saloon. Garrett tells Poe to ride on without him and that Garrett will pick him up in Roswell in five or six days. Three members of Billy's gang come into the saloon. After taunting Holly (Richard Bright) and getting him drunk, Garrett shoots him dead after he pulls a knife. He tells Alias to give Billy a message that they had \\"a little drink together\\". Garrett rides to Roswell ahead of Poe to gather more clues on Billy's whereabouts. Garrett beats up a prostitute named Ruthie Lee (Rutanya Alda) and learns from her that Billy is in Fort Sumner. Poe arrives in Roswell to find Garrett naked and in bed with several prostitutes, and confirms that Billy is in Fort Sumner. Garrett recruits an old friend he helped become a sheriff and along with Poe rides to Fort Sumner to find Billy. Later that night Billy and his girlfriend, the daughter of Pete Maxwell, have sex as Garrett and his two deputies arrive. Billy goes to get some meat and, after seeing Garrett's deputies (who are both afraid to shoot the Kid), backs into a bedroom where Garrett shoots him. Garrett angrily hits Poe for attempting to cut off Billy's trigger finger. He stays on the porch until morning, when the townspeople of Fort Sumner, having heard the news of his death, gather to see Billy's lifeless body. Garrett mounts his horse and rides out of town, with a small boy throwing stones at him.

The two had previously worked together on the acclaimed film Two-Lane Blacktop (1971). Sam Peckinpah became involved through actor James Coburn, who wanted to play the legendary sheriff Pat Garrett. Peckinpah believed that this was his chance to make a definitive statement on the Western genre and complete the revision that he had begun with Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969). Working with Wurlitzer, he rewrote the script in order to create a more cyclical narrative, and added a prologue and epilogue depicting Garrett's own assassination at the hands of the men who hired him to kill Billy the Kid. In the original script, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid never met onscreen until the film's conclusion, and Wurlitzer reportedly resented Peckinpah's reworking of the narrative. Wurlitzer and Peckinpah had a strained relationship, and Wurlitzer would later write a book highly unfavorable to Peckinpah. Peckinpah initially considered Bo Hopkins for the part of Billy, but he eventually cast country music star Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw. Kristofferson was 36 when the film was made, playing 21-year-old Billy. Kristofferson's band would play small roles, along with his wife Rita Coolidge. Kristofferson also brought Bob Dylan into the film, initially hired to write the title song. Dylan eventually wrote the score and played the role of \\"Alias\\". Peckinpah had never heard of Dylan, but was reportedly moved by hearing him play the proposed title song and hired him immediately. Among the songs written by Dylan for the film was \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\". Peckinpah deliberately cast his film's supporting roles with legendary Western character actors such as Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Barry Sullivan, Dub Taylor, R.G. Armstrong, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Paul Fix. Jason Robards had starred in Peckinpah's earlier films, the television production Noon Wine (1966) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), and had a cameo appearance as the governor. The large supporting cast also included Richard Jaeckel, Charles Martin Smith, Harry Dean Stanton, Matt Clark, L.Q. Jones, Emilio Fern√°ndez, Aurora Clavel, Luke Askew, Jack Dodson, Richard Bright, and John Beck. From the beginning, the production was plagued with difficulties. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer President James Aubrey, for economic reasons, refused to give Peckinpah the time or budget required, forcing the director to rely on local crew members in the Mexican state of Durango. Multiple technical problems, including malfunctioning cameras, led to costly reshoots. Cast and crew members also came down with influenza. Aubrey objected to several scenes that he considered superfluous to the film's plot, and Peckinpah and his crew reportedly worked weekends and lunch hours to secretly complete the sequences. Aubrey began to send telegrams to the set complaining about the number of camera setups that Peckinpah used and the time spent to shoot specific scenes. According to producer Gordon Carroll, the movie's set was \\"a battleground.\\" Peckinpah was plagued by alcoholism, with which he would struggle for the remainder of his life. This, combined with his clashes with Aubrey and the studio, led to his growing reputation as a difficult, unreliable filmmaker. Reportedly, when Dylan first arrived on the set, he and Kristofferson sat to watch dailies with Peckinpah. The director was so unhappy with the footage that he angrily stood on a folding chair and urinated on the screen.Burns, Sean. \\"Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid: Peckinpah's Unfinished Masterpiece,\\" 90.9 WBUR-FM (Boston, MA), Monday, August 10, 2015. Retrieved March 22, 2020 Similar stories began to reach Hollywood, prompting Peckinpah to purchase a full-page ad in The Hollywood Reporter mocking the rumors and the brass at MGM. The Hollywood producers were not amused. The film finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget.\\"Director‚Äôs Cut: 10 Theatrical Versions Vs.

I asked Bob, 'Why isn't Willie famous? He's a genius.' So, the next day, Bob calls Willie up and gets him to come down to the set, and he made him play his old Martin guitar for ten hours straight. They ended up doing all these old Django Reinhardt tunes. It was fabulous.\\"Bell, Max: \\"Q&A;: Kris Kristofferson\\"; Classic Rock #148, August 2010, p34 Post-production controversy, release and Preview version  By the time that Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was in the editing room, Peckinpah's relationship with the studio and his own producers had reached the breaking point. Aubrey, enraged by the cost and production overruns, demanded the film for an unrealistic release date. Peckinpah and his editors were forced into a desperate situation in order to finish on time. Furthermore, Aubrey still objected to several sequences in the film which he wanted removed, forcing Peckinpah to engage in protracted negotiations over the film's content. Adding to the problems, Bob Dylan had never done a feature film score and Peckinpah's usual composer, Jerry Fielding, was unhappy with being relegated to a minor role in the scoring process. Peckinpah did complete a preview version of the film, which was shown to critics on at least one occasion. Martin Scorsese had just made Mean Streets (1973) and was at the screening, and he praised the film as Peckinpah's greatest since The Wild Bunch. This version, however, would not see the light of day for over ten years. Peckinpah was eventually forced out of the production, and Aubrey had the film severely cut from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in the film being released as a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. This version was a box-office failure, grossing $8 million domestically, of which the studio earned only $2.7 million in theatrical rentals,\\"Big Rental Films of 1973\\", Variety, 9 January 1974 p 19 against a budget of more than $4.6 million. However, the film grossed a total of $11 million worldwide. The film was also panned by most major critics, who had harbored high expectations for the director's spiritual successor to The Wild Bunch. Though she acknowledged its ambition and \\"amazing cast\\", Pauline Kael described the film as \\"peculiarly unrealized\\" and mused that \\"probably nobody involved was very happy about the results\\". Roger Ebert rated the film two stars out of four, beginning his review with: \\"Sam Peckinpah attempted to have his name removed from Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. I sympathized with him. If this wasn't entirely his work, he shouldn't have had to take the blame.\\" Ebert went on to note, \\"Another alarming factor is that no less than six editors are credited. Not assistant editors, but editors; this sets a modern-day record, I think. My guess is that there was an argument over the movie's final form, and that Peckinpah and MGM platooned editors at each other during the battle. You'd think the executives would have figured out that their only chance was to release the movie as Peckinpah made it; audiences were more interested in the new Peckinpah film than in still another rehash of Billy the Kid.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the same two-star grade and wrote that the film \\"appears to have been shot in emotional slow motion, and the self-inflating lethargy and mugging of all concerned reduces the enterprise to an exercise in pretension.\\"Siskel, Gene (June 1, 1973). \\"The dialog's as slow as a Peckinpah bullet\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 6. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has the manner of something written for Peckinpah by a writer who'd seen 'The Wild Bunch' and vowed to give the director an important script, something worthy of his talents. Instead, Mr. Wurlitzer has come up with what is apparently an unconscious parody of the Peckinpah concerns for fading frontiers, comradeship and machismo.\\" Canby also found the Bob Dylan music \\"so oppressive that when it stops we feel giddy with relief, as if a tooth had suddenly stopped aching.\\"Canby, Vincent (May 24, 1973). \\"Screen: Peckinpah's 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'\\". The New York Times. 53. Variety declared, \\"Whereas Peckinpah's nostalgia for a frontier world where might makes right and women were for the taking has previously been communicated via forceful acting and striking visuals, here there are few graces to camouflage the narrative banality.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid\\". Variety. May 30, 1973. 13. Not every contemporary review was negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Although 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' (at selected theaters) is approximately 15 minutes shorter than its director Sam Peckinpah cut it, it nevertheless emerges as a remarkable film that is perhaps Peckinpah's best, most mature work to date.\\" Thomas, Kevin (May 24, 1973). \\"A New Aspect of Old West\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 17. Richard Combs of The Monthly Film Bulletin was also generally favorable, declaring that \\"for all the deliberate‚Äîand occasionally over- schematic‚Äîsummation of [Peckinpah's] previous work, Pat Garrett is remarkable for its intensity of mood (and for the growling, damped-down charisma of Coburn and Kristofferson); a singularly black and poetic evocation of a no- exit life style.\\" The film remained something of an enigma for the next decade, with rumors flying about other versions and the nature of what had been left out of the release version. Peckinpah himself was in possession of his own preview version, which he often showed to friends as his own definitive vision of the film. Rediscovery, legacy and Special Edition In 1988, Turner Home Entertainment, with distribution by MGM, released Peckinpah's preview version of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid on video and Laserdisc. This version led to a rediscovery and reevaluation of the film, with many critics praising it as a lost masterpiece and proof of Peckinpah's vision as a filmmaker at this time. The film's reputation has grown substantially since this version was released, and the film has come to be regarded as something of a modern classic, equal in many ways to Peckinpah's earlier films. Kristofferson noted in an interview, though, that Peckinpah had felt that Dylan had been pushed on him by the studio and thus left \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\" out of the preview version. In Kristofferson's opinion, \\"Heaven's Door\\" \\"was the strongest use of music that I had ever seen in a film. Unfortunately Sam‚Ä¶had a blind spot there.\\" In 2005, a DVD of the film distributed by Warner Bros. was released containing the preview version as well as a new special edition which combined elements of the theatrical version, the preview version, and several new scenes never released in the previous versions. This third version of the film, known as the \\"special edition\\", runs slightly shorter than the preview version.

The organisation has two components: a public limited company called Traidcraft plc, which sells fairly traded products in the United Kingdom; and a development charity called Traidcraft ExchangeOrganisation's website, About Traidcraft that works with poor producers in Africa and Asia. History Traidcraft was set up as a faith organisation in August 1979. It was launched from the top floor of a 1920s warehouse (India House, Carliol Square) in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne by Richard Adams with six members of staff. Its first catalogue was hand-drawn featuring a small selection of jute products from Bangladesh. Within two years tea, coffee and subsequently a wide range of other foods were introduced. In September 1983 the organisation moved into a warehouse on the Team Valley Trading Estate in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear. In 2004 it opened a second warehouse on the Team Valley, which houses the quality control, food packaging and logistics departments. Traidcraft also has a policy unit based in London, taking the staff total to over 140. It sells fair trade food, clothes/accessories, paper and crafts. Traidcraft works with more than 100 producer groups in over 30 countries around the world.Traidcraft website Traidcraft structure Traidcraft has overseas offices in Nairobi, Kenya; Hyderabad, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh. =Traidcraft Foundation= The Traidcraft Foundation was set up to ensure that Traidcraft plc and Traidcraft Exchange remain focused on their principal aim. It was also the Founder member of the Traidcraft Exchange charity and as such appoints all its directors. The Traidcraft Foundation holds the Guardian share in Traidcraft plc. This gives the Foundation the power of veto over election of directors to the plc board, payments of dividends and to the Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Foundation must also be consulted on Traidcraft's major strategic plans and has a role of representing the views of external stakeholders in the social accounting process. =Traidcraft plc= Traidcraft plc is the trading arm of the organisation. The products are sourced from producers in over 30 developing countries including India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya, Malawi, Chile and Cuba. Products include coffee, tea, fruit juice, sugar, wine, clothing, jewellery, paper and craft items. Among their food products is a snack bar called Geobar, Fairtrade chocolate, dried fruit, honey, pasta, rice and muesli. Traidcraft plc holds a 10% stake in Caf√©direct which it set up jointly with Equal Exchange Trading, Oxfam and Twin Trading. Traidcraft is a founder member of the European Fair Trade Association (EFTA). Traidcraft also helped establish the Fairtrade Foundation with CAFOD, Christian Aid, New Consumer, Oxfam and World Development Movement in 1992. It was also instrumental in the establishment of Newcastle-based company Shared Interest in 1990. Shared Interest is a co-operative lending society that aims to reduce poverty in the world, by providing fair and just financial services. Traidcraft plc aims to tackle poverty by creating a market for fair trade producers and to show the commercial viability of the fair trade model. =Traidcraft Exchange= Traidcraft Exchange is the charitable arm of the Traidcraft organisation. Its first director was Graham Young. Registered charity number: 1048752. Established in 1986, Traidcraft Exchange aims to enable poor producers in Africa and Asia to grow their businesses, find markets, and engage effectively in trade. They are currently managing 14 major projects with a total value of about ¬£5.5 million. These projects are directly benefiting 350,000 people with a further 1.4 million indirectly benefiting.Traidcraft website Traidcraft Exchange also lobbies and advises governments and organisations with the aim of improving trade rules and market access for small organisations in the developing world. This is done by the Policy Unit which focuses on trade and development policies within the UK Government, the European Union and the World Trade Organization. The Policy Unit also works with other fair trade organisations in the UK, Europe and internationally. The Traidcraft Exchange was awarded the 1999 Worldaware Award for Not-for-Profit Organisations in recognition of its positive work. Social accounts Definition: Social accounting is a systematic means of accounting for the social impact of an organisation. Traidcraft was the first public limited company in the United Kingdom to produce a set of social accounts and has been doing so every year since the early 1990s. The social accounts that are produced are a joint account of the impact both companies work has on various stakeholders. The social accounts are treated with the same seriousness as the financial accounts. They are also submitted to an external audit, and approval at the Annual General Meeting. Traidcraft has won awards for the social accounts it reports. In 2005 it was awarded the Social Enterprise Champion (Organisation) Award at the New Statesman Upstarts awards. In 2006 it received the Queen's Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) gives out the award annually for Corporate social responsibility: * 2007 - Joint Commendation for SME reporting * 2006 - Commendation for reporting on stakeholder engagement * 2005 - Winner * 2004 ‚Äì Runner-up Traidcraft Meet the People Tours Traidcraft has run trips to visit fair trade producers for over 20 years. The tours offer people who are interested in fair trade the chance to visit fair trade producers in developing countries such as: Bangladesh, Chile, Cuba, Ghana, India. The tour includes visits to workshops, workers' homes as well as visiting sites of historic interest. Traidcraft Meet the People tours were highly commended in the Award for Best Tour Operator in 2005.

Used during the interwar period, it provided excellent service on a number of British fighters and bombers of the era, such as the Hawker Fury and Hawker Hart family, and the Handley Page Heyford. The engine also sold to international air forces, and it was even used to power prototypes of German military aircraft types that were later used during the Battle of Britain. Several Kestrel engines remain airworthy today. Design and development =Origin= The Kestrel came about as a result of the excellent Curtiss D-12, one of the first truly successful cast-block engines. Earlier designs had used individually machined steel cylinders that were screwed onto a crankcase, whereas the cast-block design used a single block of aluminium that was machined to form cylinders. The result was both simpler to build as well as lighter and much stronger, requiring only an investment in new machining equipment.Rubbra 1990, p.19. The D-12 was one of the most powerful engines of its era, and continued to exchange records with other contemporary high-power engines. No British company could offer anything like it, and when Fairey imported 50 of the type (renaming them as the Fairey Felix) the Air Ministry had enough and ordered Napier and Rolls-Royce to start work on cast-block engines of their own. Arthur Rowledge, one of Napier's chief engineers and the designer of the Napier Lion engine, became fed up with management and left for Rolls.Lumsden 2003, p.164. In this one move any Napier design effort ended while Rolls' received a boost. Applying every known advance since the D-12 was introduced, Rowledge designed the new engine to use supercharging at all altitudes, allowing it to outperform naturally aspirated engines by as much as they were willing to increase the boost pressure. =Cooling system= One key advance in the Kestrel was the use of a pressurised cooling system. Water boils at 100 ¬∞C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of maximum coolant temperature and volume, and the coolant has to be kept below boiling point, an increasing amount of fluid had to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby increasing the temperature at which it boils: not only does this prevent the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, it also increases the boiling point even at ground level. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150 ¬∞C.Rubbra 1990, p.43. =Improvements= Streamlined Kestrel installation of the Hawker Hind. The driving dog for a Hucks starter can be seen The engine was first produced in 1927 at 450 hp (340 kW), which soon improved in the IB version to 525 hp (390 kW). This variant saw widespread use in the Hawker Hart family that was the mainstay of British air power during the early 1930s. However, it was not long before power output was increased dramatically; the V model provided 695 hp (520 kW) at 3,000 rpm with no basic change to the design, while the XVI used in the Miles Master delivered 670 hp (500 kW). Messerschmitt also tested its first Messerschmitt Bf 109 V1 prototype, bearing German civilian registration D-IABI, with a Kestrel engine in 1935 as the German-designed intended engines were not yet ready. Junkers also used a Kestrel for the first prototype of the Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive bomber. The Reich Air Ministry (RLM) acquired four Kestrel VI engines by trading Rolls-Royce a Heinkel He 70 Blitz as an engine testbed.This aircraft was instrumental in testing the Rolls-Royce PV-12, later to become the Rolls-Royce Merlin. Increased availability of higher octane aviation fuels in the late 1930s allowed the engine to be boosted to higher power levels without suffering from detonation, and the Kestrel eventually attained a power output of 720 hp (537 kW) in the XXX variant of 1940.Lumsden 2003, p.196. Further developments of the Kestrel were the Goshawk and the Peregrine (and therefore the Vulture). In practice, development of the Peregrine and Vulture was troubled, and they were both cancelled with comparatively few built. Variants The Kestrel was produced in 40 distinct variants which can be divided into three main groups: normally aspirated, medium supercharged, and fully supercharged. One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from supercharging, the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and propeller reduction gearing.Lumsden 2003, pp.190-197.

Saved was the second album of Dylan's \\"Christian trilogy\\", following his conversion to Evangelical Christianity. It expanded on themes explored on its predecessor Slow Train Coming, with gospel arrangements and lyrics extolling the importance of a strong personal faith. Artwork The cover of Saved originally featured a painting by Tony Wright of Jesus Christ's hand reaching down to touch the hands of his believers. However, this cover was subsequently replaced by a painting of Dylan on stage performing during that time period in order to downplay the overtly religious nature of the original cover. It has since been changed back on some re-releases. A quote inside the sleevenotes reads: \\"'Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah' (Jeremiah 31:31)\\". Release and reception The album hit No. 3 on the UK charts, reached No. 24 on the US charts and did not go gold. CCM Magazine described the album as an \\"open declaration of Dylan's deepening faith.\\" Critical reaction to the album was mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a \\"C+\\", which is described by Christgau as \\"most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork\\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Kurt Loder praised Dylan's backing band, but felt that several songs were hampered by overtly religious messages, although he did single out \\"In the Garden\\" for having a \\"lovely, billowing arrangement\\". Loder stated that Dylan's efforts at a gospel album were not as remarkable as others \\"not just because he lacks the vocal equipment but because he's too inventive, too big for the genre\\", but summarised Saved as a gospel work with \\"some distinction\\".

It ultimately originated among Indian South Africans of Durban. A small version of the bunny chow that uses only a quarter loaf of bread is sometimes called, by black South Africans, a scambane or kota (\\"quarter\\"); it is a name that it shares with spatlo, a South African dish that evolved from the bunny chow. History Bunny chow was created in Durban, home to a large community of people of Indian origin. The precise origins of the food are disputed, although its creation has been dated to the 1940s. It was also sold in Gwelo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) during World War II and is still sold in the nearby town of Kadoma, formerly known as Gatooma. Stories of the origin of bunny chow date as far back as the migrant Indian workers' arrival in South Africa. One account suggests that said Indian laborers who came to work the sugar cane plantations of Kwazulu-Natal (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field; a hollowed-out loaf of bread was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries. Meat-based fillings came later. The use of a loaf of white bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread as well as its weak structure; thus the cheap loaf, widely available at local stores, would be an optimal substitute vessel for the curry. Etymology A table of hollowed \\"quarter loaves\\" to be filled for bunny chow. One story claims that a South African restaurant run by Banias (an Indian caste) first created the dish at a restaurant-caf√©, called Kapitan's, on the corner of Victoria and Albert streets in Durban. Another tale opines that the origin of this handheld dish was due to Indian golf caddies not being allowed to publicly carry sharp cutlery like knives during apartheid. \\"\\" in South African English is simply slang for \\"food\\" as well as the verb \\"to eat\\". The traditional Indian meal was roti and beans, but rotis tended to fall apart as a take-away item. To solve this, they hollowed the centre portion of a loaf of white bread and filled it with curry, then capped the filling with the portion that was carved out. The vegetarian version of the meal is sometimes known as a \\"beans bunny\\". An alternate, albeit unlikely etymology is derived from a mondegreen of \\"bun\\" and \\"achar\\" (Indian pickles), though the latter are not usually included in the dish (unless as an accoutrement). Cuisine Quarter mutton bunny chow in Durban, South Africa Bunny chows are popular amongst Indians and other ethnic groups in the Durban area. Bunny chows are commonly filled with curries made using traditional recipes from Durban: mutton or lamb Curry, chicken curry, trotters & beans curry and beans curry. Other varieties found across the country using less traditional Durban-Indian food include chips with curry gravy, fried sausage, cheese, eggs and polony. These are all popular fillings; the original bunny chow was vegetarian. Bunny chows are often served with a side portion of salad containing grated carrot, chilli and onion salad. commonly known as sambals, this includes chopped tomatoes, onions, and green chilies served with white vinegar. Other sides include Indian pickles, such as mango pickle, lime or lemon pickle, vegetable pickles and other seasonal varieties which are pickled. A key desirable characteristic of a bunny chow is seen when gravy from the curry fillings soaks into the walls of the bread. Sharing a single bunny chow is not uncommon. Bunny chows come in quarter, half and full loaves. When ordering a bunny chow in Durban, the local slang dictates that you need only ask for a \\"quarter mutton\\" (or flavour and size of your choice), colloquially, people would say, \\"Can I have a quarter mutton bunny.\\" Bunny chows are mainly eaten using the fingers; it is unusual to see locals use utensils when eating this dish. Bunny chows were historically packaged in the previous day's newspaper. This is no longer common, and takeaway bunnies are more typically sold in \\"bunny boxes\\" which retain heat and prevent leaks from the curry. Bunny chows are available in many small takeaways and Indian restaurants throughout South Africa. The price ranges from for a quarter beans or dhal, to for a quarter mutton bunny, and generally one can multiply the price of a quarter by between 3 and 4 to attain the price of a full bunny. Each year, the \\"Bunny Chow Barometer\\" is held in September on the south bank of the Umgeni River, just above Blue Lagoon (a popular Sunday picnic spot for Durban Indians), attracting numerous entrants from across the Durban Metro region to compete for the title of top bunny maker.

In 2013 she was awarded the inaugural Windham‚ÄìCampbell Literature Prize for her fiction. Early life Zo√´ Wicomb was born near Vanrhynsdorp, Western Cape, in South Africa. Growing up in small-town Namaqualand, she went to Cape Town for high school, and attended the University of the Western Cape (which was established in 1960 as a university for \\"Coloureds\\").\\"UWC History\\", University of the Western Cape.\\"Zoe Wicomb A Writer Of Rare Brilliance\\". Interview by David Robinson for The Scotsman, 2000; via Intermix. After graduating, she left South Africa in 1970 for England, where she continued her studies at Reading University. She lived in Nottingham and Glasgow and returned to South Africa in 1990, where she taught for three years in the department of English at the University of the Western Cape. Since 1994 she has lived in Glasgow, where she was, until her retirement in 2009, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Strathclyde. She was Professor Extraordinaire at Stellenbosch University from 2005 to 2011. She is now Emeritus Professor at the University of Strathclyde. Career Wicomb gained attention in South Africa and internationally with her first book, a collection of inter-related short stories, You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town (1987), set during the apartheid era and partly autobiographical, as the central character is a young woman brought up speaking English in an Afrikaans-speaking \\"coloured\\" community in Little Namaqualand, attending the University of the Western Cape, leaving for England, and authoring a collection of short stories. This work has been compared to V. S. Naipaul‚Äôs The Enigma of Arrival.Donnelly, K. (2014). \\"Metafictions of development: The Enigma of Arrival, You Can‚Äôt Get Lost in Cape Town, and the place of the world in world literature\\", Journal of Commonwealth Literature, 49(1), 63‚Äì80. Her second work of fiction, the novel David's Story (2000), is set partly in 1991 toward the close of the apartheid era and explores the role of coloureds and women in the military wing of the ANC, and the challenges of adjustment to the realities of the \\"New South Africa\\". By presenting the novel as the work of an amanuensis creating a narrative out of the scattered statements of the central character, David Dirkse, Wicomb raises questions about the writing of history in a period of political instability, and by relating the stories of the Griqua people from whom Dirkse is, in part (like Wicomb), descended, it exposes the dangers of ethnic exclusiveness. The novel has been studied as a key work dealing with the transition period in South Africa along with Disgrace, by J. M. Coetzee and Bitter Fruit by Achmat Dangor.Gready, Paul. 2008. \\"Culture, Testimony, and the Toolbox of Transitional Justice\\", Peace Review 20, no. 1: 41‚Äì48. Playing in the Light, her second novel, released in 2006, is set in mid-1990s Cape Town and tells the story of Marion Campbell, the daughter of a coloured couple who succeeded in passing for white, as she comes to learn their painful story and to reassess her own place in the world of post-apartheid South Africa. Wicomb's second collection of short stories, The One That Got Away (2008), is set mainly in Cape Town and Glasgow and explores a range of human relationships: marriage, friendships, family ties and relations with servants. Many of the stories‚Äîwhich are often linked to one another‚Äîdeal with South Africans in Scotland or Scots in South Africa. Her third novel, October, was published in 2015; its central character, Mercia Murray, returns from Glasgow to Namaqualand to visit her brother and his family and to face the question of what \\"home\\" means. The novel explicitly evokes its connection with Marilynne Robinson's Home, the title Wicomb also wanted for her work. Wicomb prefers nonprofit presses for her fiction, such as The Feminist Press and The New Press. Her short stories have been published in many collections, including Colours of a New Day: Writing for South Africa (edited by Sarah Lefanu and Stephen Hayward; Lawrence & Wishart, 1990) and Daughters of Africa (edited by Margaret Busby; Jonathan Cape, 1992). Wicomb has also published numerous articles of literary and cultural criticism; a selection of these has been collected in Race, Nation, Translation: South African essays, 1990-2013 (edited by Andrew van der Vlies; Yale University Press, 2018). Her own fiction has been the subject of numerous essays, three special issues of journals (the Journal of Southern African Studies, Current Writing, and Safundi ) and a volume edited by Kai Easton and Derek Attridge, Zo√´ Wicomb & the Translocal: Scotland and South Africa (Routledge, 2017).

It is considered to be Dylan's last of a trilogy of Christian albums. Arrangements are rooted more in rock, and less in gospel than Dylan's two previous albums. At the time of its release, Shot of Love received mixed reviews; Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone criticized the album, though he did single out the last track, \\"Every Grain of Sand\\", as a stand-out. Shot of Love, while reaching UK No. 6, continued Dylan's US commercial decline, reaching No. 33 during a brief chart stay. Bono of Irish band U2 described Shot of Love as one of his favorites, particularly due to Dylan's singing ability. Recording sessions Throughout 1980, Dylan was still focused on religious-oriented music in what was dubbed his 'Born Again' period that was marked by prolific songwriting. It continued through the summer, when Dylan began work on his follow-up album to Saved. \\"Property of Jesus\\", \\"Yonder Comes Sin\\", and new arrangements of older material like \\"Ain't Gonna Go to Hell (For Anybody)\\" were composed during this time, as were \\"Caribbean Wind\\" and \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\", which \\"contrast[ed] his troubled sexual relations with the demands of a higher calling\\", according to Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin. Then, sometime in mid- September, Dylan reassembled his standing band at Rundown Studios in Santa Monica, California, where they recorded a number of his new songs, including \\"Every Grain of Sand\\". A rough recording of \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" dating from this period was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991. Dylan embarked on a tour in November and December 1980, before returning to his songwriting. In March 1981, Dylan held more informal sessions at both Rundown and Studio 55, rehearsing some of his new compositions while auditioning a potential producer, Jimmy Iovine. These sessions focused on the song \\"Caribbean Wind\\", an ambitious work that had been performed live once during November. Already generating interest in the rock press, \\"Caribbean Wind\\" was seen as a potential centerpiece for his upcoming album, but it was not quite considered finished. Numerous attempts at recording \\"Caribbean Wind\\" during the Iovine sessions proved disappointing, with Dylan growing increasingly pessimistic about the song's prospects. \\"Angelina\\" was recorded with much greater success, and Dylan was satisfied enough to mark it for inclusion. In the meantime, Dylan concluded that another producer was needed, but after relieving Iovine of his duties, Dylan struggled to find an appropriate producer, as well as an appropriate studio. Various sessions were booked across Los Angeles, including sessions at Cream Studios and United Western Studios. None of these places provided the sound Dylan had in mind but had difficulty creating. The sessions did provide an opportunity to rehearse new compositions, including \\"In the Summertime\\", as well as experiment with new ideas. Dylan resigned himself to Rundown, where he and his band worked through his songs over a period of several weeks. Sometime in late April, veteran producer Bumps Blackwell stopped by to see Dylan. Blackwell was best known for producing Little Richard's most celebrated recordings, and though the purpose of his visit remains unclear, Blackwell ultimately produced that day's session, supervising recordings of \\"Trouble\\", \\"Magic\\" and \\"Shot of Love\\" that were later selected for the album. The experience gave Dylan an enormous amount of satisfaction, as he would later reveal in subsequent interviews, but Blackwell did not return for further work, possibly because of health issues. Chuck Plotkin, who had experience working with Bruce Springsteen, was eventually hired by Dylan on the suggestion of a friend, Debbie Gold. Five sessions were scheduled for Plotkin's Clover Studio, beginning on April 27 and ending on May 1, and work proceeded on songs like \\"Property of Jesus\\", \\"Watered-Down Love\\", \\"Heart of Mine\\", \\"Lenny Bruce\\", \\"Dead Man, Dead Man\\", \\"In the Summertime\\", and \\"Every Grain of Sand\\", all of which received usable takes that were marked for the album. An extensively rewritten and rearranged version of \\"Caribbean Wind\\" was also recorded at Clover, but once again, Dylan was disappointed with the results; it was ultimately set aside for an indefinite amount of time. On May 12, Dylan and Plotkin sequenced a preliminary version of Shot of Love, but after listening to it the following day, Dylan decided to remove \\"Angelina\\" and \\"Magic\\" from the final sequence. The remaining nine songs were retained, but Dylan decided to re-record several of those songs. Three re-recordings were eventually used for the final sequence: \\"Trouble\\", \\"Dead Man, Dead Man\\", and \\"Heart of Mine\\", all of which were taped two to three days after the preliminary sequence was approved. The mixing process proved rather tense as Plotkin and Dylan had conflicting ideas on how to mix the songs. Plotkin made numerous prototype mixes, delivering each one on cassette dub over to Dylan at Rundown Studios. Most, if not all of them, were rejected. \\"Chuck [wanted] to get a nice mix at the end of each song\\", recalls Jim Keltner, \\"and Bob wouldn't have any of the nice mixes. Most everything you hear on that Shot of Love album turns out to be the monitor mixes.\\" Plotkin spent another month mixing and overdubbing over the nine songs selected for Shot of Love. Mixing was finally completed on June 7, with overdubbing continuing through June 16. Songs Unlike Dylan's previous studio album Saved, Shot of Love included more secular material as well as overtly religious and evangelistic songs. The opening title track of Shot of Love makes a few spiritual references while railing against substance abuse. \\"The purpose of music is to elevate and inspire the spirit\\", Dylan said in a 1983 interview with NME. \\"To those who care where Bob Dylan is at, they should listen to \\"Shot of Love\\". It's my most perfect song. It defines where I am spiritually, musically, romantically and whatever else. It shows where my sympathies lie. It's all there in that one song.\\" Produced by Bumps Blackwell, it's the only Blackwell production featured on Shot of Love. The second track on Shot of Love fits, again, somewhere between in secular and religious territory. A slight but jaunty, Tex-Mex number, \\"Heart of Mine\\" is a love song, Dylan's first in several years, but it is founded on Jeremiah 17:9, \\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\\" Instead of singing to a person of interest, the narrator addresses his own \\"heart\\", trying to tame his own impulses and emotions in fear of getting hurt. An earlier performance was already selected for use when Dylan decided to re- record \\"Heart of Mine\\" with Ronnie Wood and Ringo Starr. In an interview taken in 1984, Dylan admitted that \\"Heart of Mine\\" was \\"done a bunch of different ways ... but I chose for some reason a particularly funky version of that‚Äîand it's really scattered. It's not as good as some of the other versions, but I chose it because Ringo and Ronnie Wood played on it, and we did it in like ten minutes.\\" A live version from August 1981 is included on the Biograph compilation. The original version of \\"Heart of Mine\\" remains available only on bootlegs. Continuing the evangelism of Slow Train Coming and Saved, \\"Property of Jesus\\" is another one of Dylan's sharp put-down songs, this time aimed at non-believers who sneer at the Christian faithful. The fourth track, \\"Lenny Bruce\\", is about the subversive Jewish comedian of that name. An influential entertainer whose use of provocative language led to a famous obscenity trial, Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966. Despite the secular tone of the lyrics, the music is \\"anchored in the resolute cadences of piano gospel\\", according to music critic Tim Riley. Often regarded as a bizarre tribute, the song portrays Bruce as some kind of martyr, even though its characterizations of Bruce have been described as peculiar and almost non-descript. When Dave Herman asked why, after so many years, Dylan chose to write a song about Lenny Bruce (July 2, 1981 interview), he answered, \\"You know, I have no idea! I wrote that song in five minutes! I found it was a little strange after he died, that people made such a hero out of him. When he was alive he couldn't even get a break. And certainly now, comedy is rank, dirty and vulgar and very unfunny and stupid, wishy-washy and the whole thing. ... But he was doing this same sort of thing many years ago and maybe some people aren't realizing that there was Lenny Bruce, who did this before and that is what happened to him. So these people can *do* what they're doing now. I don't know.\\" The first verse might, in fact, be seen to offer a subtle cut to Bruce's imitators for whom the use of profanity is a cheap \\"shock\\" gimmick, while for Bruce it was a strike for free speech: \\"He was an outlaw, that's for sure/More of an outlaw than you ever were.\\" When Shot of Love was reissued for compact disc, \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\" was added into the album sequence. Recorded during the Shot of Love sessions, it was originally issued as a B-side to the 45rpm release of \\"Heart of Mine\\". Throughout the song, Dylan sings of a theological schism that ultimately separates the narrator and a woman, whom he addresses as 'Claudette.' The term 'groom' is used or implied in the Bible and in Christian theology. In this context, Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom to the Church, the Bride of Christ. Widely praised and heavily played on progressive radio, Riley called it \\"a generous return to slow-burning defiance that restores not only the lust to Dylan's heart, but the power to his voice.\\" Together with \\"Caribbean Wind\\" (an outtake discussed below), \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\" marked a dramatic change in lyrical direction, one Dylan would continue to follow in his next album, Infidels. \\"Watered-Down Love\\" is Dylan's version of 1 Corinthian's 13, describing \\"love that's pure\\", and lamenting that pure love is not what many people want. The reggae-tinged \\"Dead Man, Dead Man\\" is another evangelical song. As Greil Marcus writes in Salon.com, it \\"is a textbook warning against the devil, if you listen as if you're reading; if you hear it, it's a poker game, and the singer's winning.\\" But, actually, the song's theme is Romans 7:24 \\"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\\", and \\"dead man\\" that Dylan is addressing is himself, admitting his moral fallibility and mocking his own appearance \\"Satan's got you by the heel/There's a bird's nest in your hair.\\" A song based in wistful retrospection, \\"In the Summertime\\" is perhaps the most relaxed, upbeat song on the entire album. Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone opined that \\"In the Summertime\\" has \\"a lovely feel to it, and Dylan's harmonica playing hangs in the air like the scent of mimosa.\\" \\"Trouble\\" is the quintessential blues song about how tribulation is intrinsic to human existence. In recent years, some critics have grown to appreciate Shot of Love while others continue to disparage it. If there is any critical consensus, it's to be found on the closing track. Marked by an ethereal quality that is not found elsewhere on Shot of Love, \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" is one of Dylan's most celebrated recordings. In this song, Dylan puzzles over the dilemma of whether his disappointments, temptations, failings, and triumphs were due to his actions alone or ordained by God's delivering hand (\\"I've gone from rags to riches in the sorrows of the night/In the violence of a summer's dream/In the chill of a winter light\\" and \\"I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea/Sometimes I turn and there's someone there; sometimes it's only me\\"). It's \\"perhaps his most sublime work to date\\", writes Clinton Heylin, \\"the summation of a number of attempts to express what the promise of redemption meant to him personally. One of his most intensely personal songs, it also remains one of his most universal. Detailing 'the time of my confession/the hour of my deepest need,' the song marks the conclusion of his evangelical period as a songwriter, something its position at the conclusion of Shot of Love tacitly acknowledges.\\" Paul Nelson called it \\"the 'Chimes of Freedom' and 'Mr. Tambourine Man' of Bob Dylan's Christian period ... it has surety and strength all down the line. Also vulnerability ... Dylan's beautifully idiosyncratic harmonica playing has metamorphosed into an archetype that pierces the heart and moistens the eye. And, for once, the lyrics don't let you down. The artist's Christianity is both palpable and comprehensible ... For a moment or two, he touches you, and the gates of heaven dissolve into a universality that has nothing to do with most of the LP.\\" Tim Riley described \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" as \\"a prayer that inhabits the same intuitive zone as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" - you'd swear it was a hymn passed down through the ages.\\" Rock critic Milo Miles wrote, \\"This is the one Dylan song in ten years ... in which he examines a pop-culture paradox (that legendary stars in particular have to believe in ideals greater than themselves) more eloquently than any other performer has.\\" When Bruce Springsteen inducted Dylan into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame on January 20, 1988, he would also cite \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" as an example of his best work. Aftermath A number of critics had already turned on Dylan for the evangelism of his last two albums, but the reception for Shot of Love was particularly harsh. Despite lavishing praise on \\"Every Grain of Sand\\", Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone savaged the rest of the album. Nick Kent of New Musical Express called it \\"Dylan's worst album to date.\\" Despite heavy touring in Europe and North America (in which all but two songs were performed), sales of Shot of Love were below CBS's expectations. Still, in an interview taken in 1983, Dylan would describe Shot of Love as a personal favorite. Religion still held a strong place in Dylan's work, but as 1981 came to a close, his religious songs gave way to more secular material. During concerts in the summer of 1981, he covered Dave Mason's \\"We Just Disagree\\" and Dion's \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\". Some fans took the latter as a veiled ode to John Lennon, who was shot and killed the preceding winter, but in fact most of Dylan's performances of this song had been in the month immediately preceding Lennon's death, as a staple in the November‚ÄìDecember 1980 US tour. Clinton Heylin notes, \\"Dylan was audibly coming to the end of this particular road.\\" The year 1982 began with personal tragedy when Dylan's close and longtime friend Howard Alk was found dead at Rundown Studios on New Year's Day. His death was ruled a suicide. As Heylin reports, \\"recent months had seen the deaths of guitarist Michael Bloomfield and fellow Christian musician Keith Green\\", all of whom worked with Dylan, but Alk's death marked the end of an era. Dylan would soon dissolve his standing band, and he would not tour again until 1984. Sometime after June 1982, Dylan closed down Rundown Studios. Shot of Love was the last album issued under a contract signed with CBS in 1978, but despite the decline in his commercial standing, Dylan was re-signed to another contract (a five-year, five-album deal) in July 1982. Much of 1982 was relatively quiet in terms of musical activity. An album of duets was recorded with his lover Clydie King at Gold Star Studios, but it would remain unreleased. At the time Dylan explained, \\"it doesn't fall into any category that [CBS] knows how to deal with.\\" However, the stage was set for his next album. Unlike his work on Shot of Love, his next batch of songs would not be auditioned on stage. As Dylan completed his new songs in private, much time would be spent in Minneapolis catching up with his eldest, 16-year-old son, Jesse; this involved frequenting performances of new wave and punk acts like The Clash, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, and X.

Built between 946 and 972, el-Mansuriya was a walled city holding elaborate palaces surrounded by gardens, artificial pools and water channels. It was briefly the centre of a powerful state that encompassed most of North Africa and Sicily. It continued to serve as provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful objects or relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today, only faint traces remain. Background The Fatimid Caliphate originated in an Ismaili Shia movement launched in Syria by Abd Allah al-Akbar. He claimed descent through Ismail, the seventh Shia imam, from the Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. The Fatimid Dynasty is named after Fatimah. In 899 Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah became leader of the movement. He fled from his enemies to Sijilmasa in Morocco, where he proselytized under the guise of being a merchant. El-Mahdi was supported by a noble man named Abu Abdullah al-Shi'i, who organized a Berber uprising that overthrew the Tunisian Aghlabid dynasty, and then invited el-Mahdi to assume the position of imam and caliph. A new capital was established at Mahdia. The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include Sicily and to stretch across North Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to Libya. The third Fatimid caliph in Ifriqiya was al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah Abu Tahir Ismail al- Mansur bi-Nasr Allah, an Ismaili Shia leader. He was invested as Imam on 12 April 946 in el-Mahdia, five weeks before his father died in great pain. He took the name el-Mansur, \\"the victor.\\" At the time, el-Mahdia was under siege by the Kharidji rebel Abu Yazid. El-Mansur launched his campaign against Abu Yazid, and by August 946 had gained the upper hand in the battle for control of Kairouan. After his victory, he decided to found his new capital city at the site of his camp in the battle, just south of Kairouan. He laid out the plan immediately after the battle, in 946, although it would take another year of struggle before Abu Yazid was finally defeated. Construction Successive extensions of the Fatimid caliphate El-Mansuriya was located less than south of the existing city of Kairouan. It replaced el-Mahdia as the capital of the empire. El-Mansur moved to the new city in 948. The Kharijite rebels had destroyed the Aghlabid city of Raqqada, and building materials were taken from this old residence. The new city covered an area of about . The city was circular, as was the original Baghdad, and the choice of layout may have been intended as a challenge to the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate based in Baghdad. The walls were twelve cubits wide, made of burned brick jointed with lime mortar. The space between the walls and the interior buildings was equal to the width of a highway. The city included a congregational mosque. The caliph's palace was near the center of the city, which contained other palaces used for ceremonial, diplomatic and administrative purposes. The main palace was called Sabra (\\"fortitude\\"). The palace grounds covered an area of . The historian Ibn Hammad described the palace buildings as high and splendid structures surrounded by gardens and waters. They demonstrated the wealth and power of the caliph. The names give some hint of the nature of the palaces: the Camphor Audience Hall, the Chamber of the Diadem, the Fragrant Audience Hall and the Silver Chamber. El-Mansuriya was completed under al-Muizz li-Din Allah, who ensured the water supply with the construction of an aqueduct. This aqueduct, in length, was based on a similar structure built by the Aghlabids. El-Muizz built a new canal on the aqueduct and added a extension to carry water to el-Mansuriya. El-Muizz also had a great hall built. Its massive columns, more than in diameter, were brought from Sousse, a day's march away. Construction of the city was not completed until 972, the year before el-Muizz moved to Egypt. Occupation Dinar minted in el-Mansuriya in 953-954 The city was primarily a royal residence. It contained palaces, gardens, a menagerie with lions, barracks and the royal stables. El-Mansur moved 14,000 Kutama families to the city and set up a souq, or marketplace. However, according to Ibn Muhadhdhab, \\"el-Muizz commanded the merchants of Kairouan to come to their shops and workshops in el-Mansuriya in the mornings, and to return home to their families in the evenings.\\" Tolls amounting to 26,000 silver dirhams were collected daily on goods entering the city through the four gates. In its heyday, el-Mansuriya was the capital of a state that encompassed most of North Africa from Morocco to Libya, as well as Sicily, although it had to guard against attack from the Byzantine Empire and from King Otto I of Germany, both active in southern Italy. In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad. The Fatimid general, Jawhar, conquered Egypt in 969. He built a new palace city in Egypt, near Fustat, which he also called el-Mansuriya. When the imam arrived in 973, the name was changed to el-Qahra (Cairo). The new city was rectangular rather than round in plan. Both cities had mosques named el-Azhar after the prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima el-Azhar, and both had gates named Bab el-Futuh and Bab Zuwaila. Both cities had two palaces, for the caliph and for his heir, opposite each other. After the Fatimid caliphs moved to Egypt, el-Mansuriya remained the capital of the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls on either side of the road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el- Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan. Destruction The city faced attacks from Arab nomads from the Banu Hilal tribe. In 1057 the Zirids abandoned it for el-Mahdia, and it was never occupied again. Its building materials were later used by the inhabitants of Kairouan. As of 2009 the site of the city was a wasteland, crossed by many ditches, surrounded by the homes of poor people. Anything that could be reused for construction or other purposes has been scavenged during the centuries since it was abandoned. Stones, bricks, glass and metal were all removed. Little survived except fragments of unusable stucco.  Archaeology  Aerial surveys of the site have confirmed that there was a very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen. A minor excavation was undertaken by George Mar√ßais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted a more thorough excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few results have been published from these earlier excavations, and no records were made of the stratigraphic locations of the stucco fragments that were found. A more careful project was undertaken between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made to place the stucco fragments. There is evidence of multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.

Self-produced, the album peaked at in the U.S. and in the UK. Accompanied by multiple session musicians‚Äîincluding members of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench and Howie Epstein‚Äîthe album has a distinct \\"80s style\\" aesthetic.Higgins, Jim Dylan's Burlesque Sounds Half-Finished. The Milwaukee Sentinel. June 14, 1985. Fans and critics continue to debate the album's merits, especially when compared to his 1960s and 1970s output. Recording Before embarking on a European tour in the summer of 1984, Dylan had spent a substantial amount of time recording demos of new songs in his Malibu home, accompanied at times by other musicians. In rehearsals for the tour, Dylan attempted at least three of these new songs, and he occasionally found time to polish their lyrics during the tour. When the tour was over, Dylan returned to New York and began work on his next studio album. As Clinton Heylin reports, Dylan recorded in sporadic sessions, as had become his norm, rather than \\"block-booking studio time\\" and recording in one concentrated period. The result was \\"an unprecedented expenditure of\\" time for recording a Dylan album, from July 1984 to March 1985 (although The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan had been recorded over a similarly long period). To accommodate the casual nature of this process, Dylan chose to produce the sessions himself. Arthur Baker, who had previously worked with New Order and Afrika Bambaataa, was later recruited for these sessions, but much of the production work would actually be Dylan's. One of his first decisions was to forgo the use of a stable set of musicians. Instead, Dylan recorded with an eclectic mix of studio professionals. An aborted session with Al Green's band was held at Intergalactic Studios on July 24, 1984. A session with Ronnie Wood (formerly of Faces and currently with The Rolling Stones), Anton Fig (best known as the drummer for David Letterman's house band), and John Paris was held at Delta Sound Studios on July 26. The Delta session produced two notable tracks: \\"Driftin' Too Far from Shore\\" and \\"Clean Cut Kid\\". The former was set aside and would not be finished until 1986, when Dylan recorded his next album, Knocked Out Loaded. The latter had originally been recorded during the Infidels sessions in 1983, but was not completed until now. Wood later described his surprise at Dylan's lack of authority during the mixing process. \\"[The engineers would] say, 'Hey Bob, we don't need this,' and he'd say, 'Oh, okay.' And they'd make a mix to their ears, and he'd just stand outside and let them do it. And I'd be saying, 'Hey! You can't let these guys...Look!! They've left off the background vocals!' or 'What about the drums?!' But there would be something going on in the back of his head which didn't allow him to interfere. And yet if he'd have gone into the control room with the dominance that he had while we were cutting the stuff, it could have been mind-bending.\\" During one session between July and September 1984 (at the Power Station), Dylan demoed a song called \\"Go 'Way Little Boy\\", with Ron Wood and \\"cowpunk\\" rockers Lone Justice. Dylan and Wood also played on Lone Justice's version of \\"Go 'Way Little Boy\\", which was recorded at the same session and was ultimately released as a B-side to their single \\"Sweet Sweet Baby (I'm Falling)\\". A blues number entitled \\"Oh Baby\\" was also recorded with the same lineup but has never surfaced. In terms of his own album, the New York sessions had so far been fairly unproductive. After six months of work, Dylan had only a few recordings that were deemed acceptable, and only two of these would eventually appear on Empire Burlesque. \\"Sometimes nothing comes out, and other times I get a lot of stuff that I keep,\\" Dylan said at the time. \\"I just put down the songs that I felt as I wanted to put them down. Then I'd listen and decide if I liked them. And if I didn't like them I'd either rerecord them or change something about them.\\" In November, Dylan returned to Los Angeles and began recording there. An early session at Ocean Way Studios produced little if any work that was used for Empire Burlesque. Much time was spent covering other artists‚Äô songs, including ‚ÄúIn the Summertime‚Äù by Ray Dorset (not to be confused with Dylan's own song of the same name), \\"Freedom for the Stallion\\" by Allen Toussaint and ‚ÄúHelp Me Make It Through The Night‚Äù by Kris Kristofferson. Work became much more productive when Dylan continued work at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood. Recruiting Lone Justice drummer Don Heffington for the early December sessions, Dylan recorded an ambitious song he had co-written with playwright Sam Shepard, titled \\"New Danville Girl\\", as well as another song. Acceptable takes were recorded for both songs, though, despite positive feedback from his peers, Dylan ultimately omitted \\"New Danville Girl\\" from Empire Burlesque. Regardless, he also found success on the next song, \\"Something's Burning, Baby\\", recorded at Cherokee on December 14. Benmont Tench, Mike Campbell and Howie Epstein, from Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, joined Heffington for the session. Over the rest of the winter, Dylan recorded most of the tracks that were ultimately used for Empire Burlesque. On January 28, 1985, another session at Cherokee produced the master take for \\"Seeing the Real You at Last\\". This was followed by a brief stop at A&M; Studios on January 28 and/or 29 to record his contribution to \\"We Are the World\\". On February 5, Dylan recorded master takes for two more tracks: \\"Trust Yourself\\" and \\"I'll Remember You\\". On February 14‚ÄîValentine's Day‚ÄîDylan recorded love songs, including Johnny Cash's \\"Straight A's in Love\\", but also one of his own, \\"Emotionally Yours\\". With the exception of the \\"We Are the World\\" session, all of these songs were recorded with Heffington, the three Heartbreakers and a few other session players at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood. Between February 14 and 19, Dylan returned to New York City, resuming work at the Power Station. On February 19, he held a session with Roy Bittan on piano and Steve Van Zandt on guitar, both members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. They recorded at least one usable take of \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\", but Bittan and Van Zandt would not return for the remainder of the sessions. The following day, Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, better known as reggae recording artists Sly & Robbie, joined the sessions. They had previously worked with Dylan on Infidels. Along with female vocalists Queen Esther Marrow, Debra Byrd and Carolyn Dennis, the group recorded \\"Never Gonna Be the Same Again\\". On February 23, Dylan returned to the Power Station with Sly & Robbie, his back-up singers and a number of session players, including Al Kooper, who filled in on guitar. The day‚Äôs work produced a significantly different version of \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\", which was ultimately chosen over the \\"Van Zandt version\\" from a few days before. Around this time, Dylan also revived from the Infidels sessions \\"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\\". \\"A song about being torn apart by irreconcilable demands,\\" according to Clinton Heylin, in revision it was stripped of \\"just about every religious allusion from the original.\\" Dylan retitled it \\"Tight Connection to My Heart\\" and set it aside for further overdubbing. One final song was recorded on March 3, a brand-new composition no more than a few days old. Recorded live-to-tape with no editing, overdubbing or embellishment, \\"Dark Eyes\\" was also sequenced as the last song of the album. Some further overdubbing was scheduled, but with recording essentially finished, Arthur Baker was left to mix the album. \\"I'm not too experienced at having records sound good,\\" said Dylan. \\"I don't know how to go about doing that. With Arthur Baker...I just went out and recorded a bunch of stuff all over the place, and then when it was time to put this record together, I brought it all to him and he made it sound like a record.\\" The songs The opening track, \\"Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)\\", was originally recorded for 1983's Infidels under the title \\"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\\" (eventually released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991). It was re-written and re-recorded several times before finding its way on to Empire Burlesque. A lushly produced pop song riding a reggae groove courtesy of Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar (better known as Sly & Robbie), the love song was singled out as the best track on the album by the most recent edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide. The track, which features Mick Taylor on guitar (from Dylan's 84 Tour), was also chosen as the first single for Empire Burlesque. Clinton Heylin describes \\"Seeing the Real You at Last\\" as \\"a compendium of images half remembered from Hollywood movies\\", as many of the lyrics made \\"allusions to Humphrey Bogart movies, Shane, even Clint Eastwood's Bronco Billy.\\" The love ballad \\"I'll Remember You\\" was still played in concert until 2005, more so than all but one other song from Empire Burlesque. It was also featured, in an acoustic version, in the movie Masked & Anonymous, though not included on the released soundtrack. \\"Clean-Cut Kid\\" was another song recorded during the Infidels sessions. The lyrics weren't finished until much later, and the finished result was included on Empire Burlesque. In the interim Bob gave the song to Carla Olson of the Textones as a thank you for her appearing in his first-ever video, for Sweetheart Like You. She included it on the Textones' debut album Midnight Mission and Ry Cooder was featured on slide guitar. A novelty song wrapped around sharp political commentary, the 'clean-cut kid' is an average American kid who's radically altered by his experience in the Vietnam War. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau praised it as \\"the toughest Vietnam-vet song yet.\\" When members of the press, as well as Dylan's own fans, dubbed Empire Burlesque as 'Disco Dylan', it was mainly for the song \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\". An evocative song filled with apocalyptic imagery, it was originally an upbeat, piledriving rocker recorded with Steven Van Zandt and Roy Bittan, both members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Unsatisfied with the recording, Dylan and Baker radically recast the song as a contemporary dance track. (The earlier version was later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991.) The penultimate song, \\"Something's Burning, Baby\\", is another song filled with apocalyptic imagery. A slow-building march accented with synthesizers, it was singled out by biographer Clinton Heylin as the strongest track on Empire Burlesque: \\"An ominous tale set to a slow march beat, [it] was a welcome reminder of his ongoing preoccupations with that dreadful day.\\" \\"Dark Eyes\\" features only Dylan on guitar and harmonica. According to earlier interviews and Dylan's autobiography Chronicles, it was written virtually on demand when Arthur Baker suggested something simpler for the album's final track. Dylan liked the idea of closing the album with a stark, acoustic track, particularly when the rest of the album was so heavily produced. However, Dylan didn't have an appropriate song. He returned to his hotel in Manhattan after midnight, and according to Dylan: \\"As I stepped out of the elevator, a call girl was coming toward me in the hallway‚Äîpale yellow hair wearing a fox coat‚Äîhigh heeled shoes that could pierce your heart. She had blue circles around her eyes, black eyeliner, dark eyes. She looked like she'd been beaten up and was afraid that she'd get beat up again. In her hand, crimson purple wine in a glass. 'I'm just dying for a drink,' she said as she passed me in the hall. She had a beautifulness, but not for this kind of world.\\" The brief, chance encounter inspired Dylan to write \\"Dark Eyes\\", which was quickly recorded without any studio embellishment. Structured like a children's song, with very rudimentary guitar work and very simple notes, it's often quoted for its last chorus: \\"A million faces at my feet, but all I see are dark eyes.\\" A number of critics have noted the bizarre sources of inspiration behind some of the songs. As mentioned, some lines were lifted from old Humphrey Bogart pictures, but at least a few were taken from the sci-fi television show Star Trek. Author Clinton Heylin wrote that \\"one of the best couplets‚Äî'I'll go along with the charade / Until I can think my way out' (from \\"Tight Connection to My Heart\\")‚Äîactually comes verbatim from a Star Trek episode, 'Squire of Gothos'.\\" Some say this line was originally used in the Humphrey Bogart movie Sahara, though this is erroneous. Outtakes One of the most famous outtakes from the EB sessions is \\"New Danville Girl\\". A satirical epic co-written with playwright Sam Shepard, it was originally an attempt at answering Lou Reed's song \\"Doin' the Things That We Want To\\" from his 1984 album New Sensations. (Reed was inspired to write \\"Doin' the Things That We Want To\\" after seeing one of Shepard's plays.) \\"It has to do with a guy standing in line and waiting to see an old Gregory Peck movie (called The Gunfighter) that he can't quite remember; only pieces of it,\\" says Shepard. \\"Then this whole memory thing happens, unfolding before his very eyes. He starts speaking internally to a woman...reliving the whole journey they'd gone on...We spent two days writing the lyrics. Bob had previously composed the melody line, which was already down on tape.\\" As Clinton Heylin notes, \\"allowing each line to raise questions that lead the listener across the flatlands of Texas and time, Shepard contributes a conversational tone that hints at the very mundanity the song's characters are seeking to transcend.\\" Session guitarist Ira Ingber recalls, \\"When we first recorded '[New Danville Girl],' we...made a cassette. And he took it out and started playing it. He came back the next day we were working and said, 'Yeah, a lot of people like this thing.' And then he didn't do anything with it. It's like he was doing it to spite people who were all liking it, and he just held on to it.\\" \\"New Danville Girl\\" would actually be re-written and re-recorded as \\"Brownsville Girl\\" for Dylan's next album, Knocked Out Loaded. Another outtake, \\"Driftin' Too Far from Shore\\", was still unfinished when it was recorded in July 1984 at Delta Studios. The same recording would later be issued on Knocked Out Loaded after several major overdubs. In addition to recording \\"Go 'Way Little Boy\\" during the Empire sessions, Dylan also recorded several other songs that did not make the final cut. He covered the 1950s classic \\"Straight A's in Love\\". He recorded a song with two widely different lyrics. The first was entitled \\"Waiting to Get Beat\\". Using the same music, he wrote new lyrics, and recorded a second version entitled \\"The Very Thought of You\\". Dylan also recorded a six-minute song entitled \\"Who Loves You More\\", which is a virtually finished take. All the cut songs from Empire Burlesque have found their way into circulation, including alternate takes to every song that made the album, as well as three takes of \\"In the Summertime\\", and two full takes of \\"Freedom for the Stallion\\". Dylan had numerous recordings from his Malibu recordings preceding his European tour in 1984. Though they were very informal, they were also used to demo songs and work out ideas that would later develop on Empire Burlesque. One composition titled \\"Angel of Rain (Almost Done)\\" was composed at these sessions. There‚Äôs no documentation suggesting Dylan recorded this during the formal Empire Burlesque sessions, but it clearly held his interest during the rehearsals for the European tour. \\"Angel of Rain\\" made a deep impression on keyboardist Ian McLagan in what was supposed to be a rehearsal for previously released material. \\"There was one beautiful song he played occasionally that he'd never recorded and never [fully] rehearsed with us either,\\" recalls McLagan. \\"It was a tricky little number. We never knew the title, but he'd launch into it from time to time, leaving us totally in the dark.\\" In 1991, one significant outtake from the Empire Burlesque sessions was released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991. An early version of \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\", recorded on February 19, 1985, it featured Roy Bittan on piano and Steve Van Zandt on guitar; both men were better known as members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. \\"The Van Zandt 'When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,' [an] apocalyptic vision bristling with drama, sung without restraint, could have provided Dylan with another epic to counterbalance the mawkish filler he'd been recording since 'New Danville Girl',\\" writes Heylin. \\"Instead, Dylan again second-guessed some of his better lines...and absolutely one of his best vocals from a fraught decade, rerecording the song...with a whomping synthesizer and horns track...\\" Music critic Tim Riley argued, \\"the alternate take...has such an undeniably raunchy attitude (and guitar solo by Miami Steve Van Zandt) you wonder why Dylan stuck with the lifeless take that makes Empire Burlesque drift off on side two.\\" The title of the album, Empire Burlesque, probably refers to a theater in Newark, NJ where strippers and comedians entertained (author Phiip Roth mentions it in Portnoy's Complaint). If Dylan were inspired, it remains to be discovered. It might have been a stop on his way to visit Woody Guthrie in Greystone Park. Reception and legacy Upon its release, Empire Burlesque received generally positive reviews, most notably a full-page review in Time magazine, but a number of critics demurred on the production, reservations that presaged Empire Burlesque's poor reputation in later years. Members of the press claimed Dylan was trying to achieve a then-contemporary sound on Empire Burlesque; Dylan jokingly replied that he didn't know anything about new music, adding \\"I still listen to Charley Patton.\\" In his Consumer Guide column for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau wrote, \\"At best [Dylan]'s achieved the professionalism he's always claimed as his goal...he's certainly talented enough to come up with a good bunch of songs. Hence, his best album since Blood on the Tracks. I wish that was a bigger compliment.\\" As promotion for Empire Burlesque, music videos for \\"Tight Connection to My Heart\\", \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\", and \\"Emotionally Yours\\" were produced and broadcast on MTV, with Paul Schrader (best known for his work with Martin Scorsese) directing the video for \\"Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)\\".

The album was received poorly upon release, and is still considered by some critics to be one of Dylan's least-engaging efforts. However, the 11-minute epic \\"Brownsville Girl\\", co-written by Sam Shepard, has been cited as one of his best songs by some critics.Gray, The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, 95-100 Sales for Knocked Out Loaded were weak, as it peaked at on U.S. charts and in the UK. Composition The album includes three cover songs, three collaborations with other songwriters and two solo compositions by Dylan. Most of the album was recorded in the spring of 1986, although recording or mixing work on one track, \\"Got My Mind Made Up\\", reportedly occurred in June. Several tracks from the album used overdubbing to build on instrumental tracks from 1984 and 1985 sessions. One song, \\"Maybe Someday\\", paraphrases a line from T. S. Eliot's poem Journey of the Magi: Eliot's \\"And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly\\" becomes in Dylan \\"Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns\\". Cover art The cover art is a reworking of the January 1939 cover of Spicy Adventure Stories. Reception The album earned mostly negative reactions, with only a rewritten version of an outtake (\\"New Danville Girl'\\", retitled \\"Brownsville Girl\\") recorded during the Empire Burlesque sessions, receiving uniform praise. Robert Christgau called it \\"one of the greatest and most ridiculous of [Dylan's] great ridiculous epics.\\" \\"Knocked Out Loaded is ultimately a depressing affair,\\" wrote Anthony DeCurtis in his review published in Rolling Stone magazine, \\"because its slipshod, patchwork nature suggests that Dylan released this LP not because he had anything in particular to say, but to cash in on his 1986 tour. Even worse, it suggests Dylan's utter lack of artistic direction.\\" In the Howard Sounes book Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, it is reported that Dylan said \\"if the records I'm making only sell a certain amount anyway, then why should I take so long putting them together?\\" Dylan has played few songs from this album in concert; \\"Driftin' Too Far from Shore\\", with 14 performances (all but one in 1988), is the most frequently performed. Four songs remain unplayed, while the other three have together been aired only five times. In recent years the album has gained a cult following among some Dylan fans who believe it is one of his least- understood works, but critical consensus remains negative, with recent reviews from Salon.com to Rolling Stone calling it a \\"career-killer\\" and \\"the absolute bottom of the Dylan barrel\\" respectively. The album was remastered and re- issued in 2013 as a part of The Complete Albums Collection, Vol. One box set.

Originally formed in 1979 as the Reflectors, the band soon renamed themselves Threats. History The Threats formed in 1979 as the Reflectors. By the early 1980s, many punk rock acts had begun to explore political issues. The Threats followed this trend, writing songs that addressed contemporary social issues. Their song Iron Maiden was directed at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Afghanistan, which featured on the B-side of the Go to Hell single, was a response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan.

Dating from at least the time of the Domesday Book. The village including Oxwick , Pattesley and South Raynham currently (2011) has 588 inhabitants living in 266 dwellings. The village has a church, (St. Mary's), in the north west corner of the village, a Village Hall, a church pond (known as the Church Pit in Norfolk dialect), a Camping Land (land once used for the game Camping, \\"camp\\" meaning battle in Old English). There is also a thriving village school for students from the age of four to eleven, a lively village Pub called \\"The Crown\\" and a playing field for soccer, cricket, rounders and school sports days. The village lies close to the source of the River Wensum which is between Colkirk, Oxwick and Whissonsett. History The name Colkirk is an Anglo-Saxon or Danish word, meaning \\"the church of Cola\\", from \\"kirk\\" meaning church and \\"Cola\\" being the name of the builder or first owner of a church perhaps over a thousand years ago. The present church may possibly be on the same site as the original building and is of medieval origin. At the time of the Domesday Book, the whole estate of the manor of Colkirk belonged to the bishop. At that time the cathedral was at North Elmham and the Domesday Book records how much land the bishop held in Colkirk, how many sheep and pigs he kept and how many people worked on his estate. Details of the original moated manor house and buildings, which included a dovecote and private chapel and was situated near Long's Lane off Dereham Road, were described in a document of 1296. Soon after the cathedral was established in Norwich in 1101, the Bishop gave Colkirk to one of the knights of his private army. This knight named himself after the village \\"Richard of Colkirk\\" and he and his successors lived at the manor house until 600 years ago, after which the house within the moat was allowed to fall into decay. right Newmarket to Wells-next-the-Sea by John Ogilby. The map shows the villages of Oxwick and Colkirk misspelled as Oxley and Cockham respectively (see about one third of the way up the fifth strip of map). The church, Raynham Hall and Beacon Hill are visible.right right right About 400 years ago in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the village began to look more like the Colkirk of today. Brick and flint started to replace timber framed wattle and clay as building materials. Some of the earliest brick and flint houses remain today, \\"Starre\\" and \\"Gable End\\" being among the oldest houses in the village and Colkirk Hall was built towards the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I around 1595. The Timperley family were one of the first recorded occupants of the Hall. The Timperley family, after whom the Timperley Estate was named, fell on hard times and lost most of their land as a penalty for helping to defend King's Lynn against Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1643. Colkirk Hall was subsequently bought by Marquis Townshend, since when it has been occupied as a farm house. Other changes were taking place in Colkirk at this time. One by one the small farmers who comprised the village population were becoming poor and sold their land to richer men. In this way there came to be just a few big farms in the village as there are today. With the formation of the big farms came the division of the old, big village fields into the smaller fields, bounded by hedges, which still exist today. All the land in the Parish was finally brought into use when the commons were enclosed and the big woods cut down about 150 years ago. The period 1820 to 1845 saw a population increase in the village and a number of houses were built or rebuilt about this time. These houses can be recognised as they were generally of red brick, rather than flint. The \\"Crown\\" was rebuilt by the Parish in 1827 and Colkirk House was built in 1837. Since then, most of the houses on the right hand side of School Road were built as model cottages, by Canon Hoare, when he was Rector of Colkirk. The School was rebuilt in 1851 and the Infants' Room added in 1894. A Chapel was established in the village in the 1830s; however, the building erected in 1875 has now been demolished. There was a Co- op in the village founded 120 years ago, having occupied three different sites in its time and finally situated in Dereham Road was closed in the 1960s. Other facilities, which were once part of village life and have passed into history, include a Pork Butcher's Shop, a General Store and a Carpenter and Undertaker, all on Hall Lane, together with a Blacksmith and a Baker's Shop on Dereham Road. The last to be closed being the Village Shop and Post Office which was on the junction of Dereham Road and Crown Road. The Village Hall was built some 140 years ago by one of the Rectors of Colkirk and is now owned by the Parish. Census population figures for the village show little change during the latter part of the 19th century and at around 450 are about 100 fewer than the present day. In the 1883 Kelly's Directory described the village thus: > COLKIRK is a parish about two miles south from Fakenham, in the Western > division of the county, Launditch hundred, union of Mitford and Launditch, > county court district of East Dereham, rural deanery of Toftrees and > archdeaconry and diocese of Norwich: the village is situated on a height, > commanding a fine prospect.

In 2011, the population of the Ryton, Crookhill and Stella ward was 8,146.  Location  Ryton lies midway between Crawcrook and Blaydon, both in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Nearby settlements include Stargate, Clara Vale, Greenside, Stella and Hedgefield. Stargate is located on the outskirts of Ryton en route to Blaydon. It has a children's park, a fish shop, a Quarry, allotments and in the neighbouring town of Crookhill there is a primary school and a general store, which can also be used as a post office. Ryton is located within Gateshead's Green Belt which mainly contains areas west and southwest of Gateshead Town because the area of South Tyneside to the east is largely urbanised.  History  Traditionally, Ryton's economy was built upon agriculture and coal mining. Some think that coal mining was taking place in the area as early as Roman times,Local History Gateshead: Ryton Retrieved 2 November 2013 however it was not until 1239 when Henry III granted that coal could be mined outside the walls that mining became extensive. There are records of coal being shipped from Winlaton to London as early as 1367. The agricultural industry in Ryton was mixed and included both pastoral farming and arable farming. Ryton's position south of the Scottish Borders and Hadrian's Wall made it a target for Scottish attacks in the area, and it is said to have been burned by William Wallace in 1297. A further attack by David II of Scotland was recorded in 1346, during which the church was plundered.The Church of the Holy Cross, Ryton, published by The Church of England in the Diocese of Durham Retrieved 3 May 2013 As well as its coal industry, Ryton formerly contained the lead-smelting reverberatory furnaces of the Ryton Company, whose mines were on Alston Moor. By 1704, this business had been amalgamated into the London Lead Company. In 1800 the Stargate Pit (Towneley Main Colliery) was opened and on 30 May 1826, a coal dust and methane (firedamp) explosion there killed 20 men and 18 boys. This became known as the \\"Stargate Pit Disaster\\". There is a memorial marker at Ryton's Holy Cross Church, and another memorial stone at the pit itself. The Stargate Pit was reopened in 1840 and not closed until 1961. Ryton soon became a place of migration for the wealthy, who wanted to escape the urban sprawl of the Industrial Revolution in Gateshead and Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. A reminder of Ryton's affluent past is found in some of the large mansions at Old Ryton Village, a place rich in rural qualities because of its proximity to Ryton Willows on the banks of the River Tyne. The most notable mansion in the village is The Grove, formerly known as Ryton Grove, a 12,000 sq ft brick building in the symmetrical Queen Anne style, believed to have been constructed for the Surtees family in 1742, and later substantially extended and remodelled in 1919. This was originally at the centre of a 350-acre estate that encompassed many houses within Ryton Village and much of Ryton Willows down to the banks of the river Tyne, including a large lake that was later divided in to two by a railway embankment. A large part of the estate became a nature reserve in 1964, with The Grove remaining in private ownership standing in 7 acres. After the decline of the coal industry during the second half of the twentieth century Ryton became increasingly suburbanised and is now used as a commuter village for those that work in the more urban areas of Tyneside. Local politics In local government, Ryton is located in the Ryton, Crookhill and Stella ward, which is in the outer west of the borough. The ward is served by three councillors, who represent Labour. Gateshead Council is Labour controlled. Ryton is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist.  Geography  The neighbouring village of Crawcrook is a nexus of coal mining nostalgia also. Remnants of several old pits across Ryton and Crawcrook, including Emma, Clara and Addison can still be found. Within a couple of hundred metres of both Crawcrook and Ryton main street there is rich countryside. Perhaps the most impressive section of this countryside is Ryton Willows Local Nature Reserve located on the banks of the Tyne, just past Old Ryton Village. It consists of 43 hectares of grassland, ponds, woodland and locally rare species of flora and fauna. Because of this it has been designated as a site of special scientific interest. Other areas of countryside include nearby Stargate pond and Addison and Hedgefield woods. It is at Addison woods that Alexander Graham Bell made one of his pioneering telephone calls. Further up the Tyne Valley, past the village of Crawcrook and into the border of Northumberland, there are rural market towns such as Prudhoe, Corbridge and Hexham.  Ryton today  A relatively affluent area of Gateshead, Ryton has experienced suburbanisation in recent years and is now used as a commuter area for those that work in the more urban areas of Tyneside. Despite being a provincial suburb, Ryton remains a vibrant area, with a variety of local amenities. In the more central part of Ryton these include a Cooperative supermarket, a Sainsbury's Local store and a selection of independent businesses and shops such as , The Lane Head micro pub, Coffee Johnny's, a dentist and various hair and beauty salons. The former Ryton Hotel public house has closed and been converted in to three shops, currently to let. There is also a community library. North East Falconry is based in Ryton with over 45 birds of prey. Ryton also boasts several restaurants and public houses, two of which are located away from Ryton Main Street, in Ryton Old Village, the community owned Ye Olde Cross and the Half Moon Inn and restaurant. The nearby village of Crawcrook offers more services, including a doctor's surgery, two veterinary surgeries, a chiropodist, another dentist, 3 pubs and a restaurant. Ryton also has an extensive Edwardian park which includes children's playing equipment, a bowling green. Away from the town centre there are two golf courses, Tyneside golf club at Ryton, and Ryton golf club in nearby Clara Vale. Both are situated in tranquil areas, near the banks of the Tyne. Ryton is home to three schools, Ryton Infants School, Ryton Junior School and Thorp Academy, all of which occupy the same site in the town. Nearby Crawcrook offers two more primary schools. Crookhill Primary is also nearby. Sport also plays a role in the local community. Apart from its golf facilities and its Edwardian park, Ryton has its own football club, Ryton F.C., who play at Crawcrook, its own rugby union team, Ryton Rugby Football Club at nearby Barmoor. Ryton also has its own cricket club, situated opposite Charles Thorp. Ryton also benefits from good public transport with regular bus services. The R3/R4 which regularly travels to Winlaton, Blaydon and Rowlands Gill via Stargate is a good example of this excellent transport. Buses also travel to Crawcrook, Prudhoe and Hexham to the west, and the MetroCentre, Gateshead and Newcastle to the east.  Other features of Ryton  Both John Wesley and Charles Wesley preached at Ryton's village green, which has a rich history with religious and social significance. Like many greens in similar villages, it played host to an annual fair which included jugglers, dancers and local stalls. The old pinfold dates back to the twelfth century. During the second half of the twentieth century the pinfold was restored. Charles Thorp set up a savings bank in 1815 in a building within the old village known as the White House which still stands there today. It is thought to have been the first bank of its kind in England.Local History Gateshead: Ryton Retrieved 2013-27-02 The annual Ryton Music Festival, held over February and March, has been held in the village for more than 60 years. It offers a variety of music and drama including choral singing and mime. The Ryton Summer Festival, held at the local comprehensive school usually includes live music, sport and arts and crafts stalls. Each year on the Tuesday before Christmas Eve villagers gather on the village green to sing traditional carols accompanied by a local brass band. There are two air raid shelters in Ryton Willows, as well as other Second World War features such trenches and shower/toilet rooms with tiles, etc. still visible, next to a railway line that was apparently used to bring children up from London. A dirt road hidden under trees leading up to the bottom of the village may have been a checkpoint.

Her husband, Komaibatiniwai, was a renowned warrior during this period and the union from this marriage produced one child, a son, Radravu. As her husband was in his twilight years the marriage ended prematurely resulting with her and her son‚Äôs return to Lakeba, at the request of her brothers, Uluilakeba I, had by now succeeded to his father‚Äôs title. Her son was raised and adopted into one of the noble households, Vatuwaqa, whilst she herself was eventually married off again to another chief from the island of Vanua Balavu.

Life He was born as a son of Ernst von Feuchtersleben (1765‚Äì1834). He was of an old Saxon noble family. His older half-brother was Eduard von Feuchtersleben (1798‚Äì1857), son of Ernst von Feuchtersleben from his first marriage. He attended the Theresian Academy in his native city, and in 1825 entered its university as a student of medicine. In 1833 he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine and settled in Vienna as a practicing surgeon. In 1834 he married. The young doctor kept up his connection with the university, where he lectured, and in 1844 was appointed dean of the faculty of medicine. He cultivated the acquaintance of Franz Grillparzer, Heinrich Laube, and other intellectuals in Vienna. He interested himself greatly in educational matters, and in 1848, while refusing the presidency of the ministry of education, accepted the appointment of under secretary of state in that department. In this capacity he attempted to introduce some important reforms in the system of education, but, discouraged by the difficulties which he encountered, he resigned in December of the following year. His health gave way, and he died at Vienna on 3 September 1849. His family now lives in Melbourne, Australia Works Among his medical works were √úber das hippokratische erste Buch von der Di√§t (Vienna, 1835) and Lehrbuch der √§rztlichen Seelenkunde (1845). The latter was translated into English two years later as 'The Principles of Medical Psychology'. It is often credited as a first notable use of the term psychopathy, used with a broad meaning more accurate to its etymological literal sense (mental disorder) than today's usage. It has also often been credited with the coining of the term psychosis, which at that time had a similarly broad meaning to psychopathy, but this has since been traced back to Karl Friedrich Canstatt's Handbuch der Medicinischen Klinik (1841). His poetical works include Gedichte (Stutt. 1836), among which is the well-known beautiful hymn, which Mendelssohn set to music, Es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rat. As a philosopher he is best known by his Zur Di√§tetik der Seele (\\"Dietetics of the soul\\") (Vienna, 1838), which attained great popularity, and the tendency of which, in contrast to Hufeland's Makrobiotik (\\"On the Art of Prolonging Life\\"), is to show the true way of rendering life harmonious and lovely. This work had by 1906 gone into fifty editions. Noteworthy also is his Beitr√§ge zur Literatur-, Kunst- und Lebenstheorie (Vienna, 1837-1841), and an anthology, Geist der deutschen Klassiker (Vienna, 1851; 3rd ed. 1865-1866). His collected works (with the exception of the purely medical ones) were published in 7 vols. by Fr. Hebbel (Vienna, 1851-1853). See M. Necker, \\"Ernst von Feuchtersleben, der Freund Grillparzers,\\" in the Jahrbuch der Grillparzer Gesellschaft, vol. iii (Vienna, 1893).

Early life and education He was born in Nottingham. After attending Nottingham High School, Adam read history at St John's College, Cambridge and graduated with a first Class degree. While at St John's he was both President of the Union and President of the University Liberal Club. After graduating, he joined the staff of the Manchester Guardian newspaper as a journalist at the age of just twenty-two. While working for the Guardian he also began working as a freelance broadcaster for BBC radio in Manchester, leaving the newspaper to join the BBC full-time in 1934 as a Home News Editor. Print journalism Adam stayed in radio for just two years before returning to the world of print journalism, joining The Star in 1936. He worked for the paper as a special correspondent until 1940, when due to the journalistic restrictions of the Second World War he temporarily left the industry to become the press officer for the British Overseas Airways Corporation. His time at BOAC was short-lived, however, as in 1941 he re-joined the staff of the BBC, this time serving as its Head of Publicity. Broadcasting Adam spent nine years in this role, before in 1950 the Director General of the BBC, William Haley, took the perhaps surprising decision to appoint him as the Controller of the BBC Light Programme, one of the BBC's most popular national radio stations. Adam took up the post at the end of the year and successfully ran the station for the next four years, although he apparently became frustrated at the lack of opportunities to move across into the newer medium of television, which was his latest ambition. Perhaps due to this frustration, in 1955 he once more decided to leave the BBC, and indeed the full-time broadcasting industry as a whole, joining Hulton Press as the company's Joint General Manager. This finally enabled him to make the move in television with the BBC's commercial competitor, ITV, as he returned to appearing on the airwaves rather than behind the scenes, becoming a chairman of the programme Free Speech. He also appeared occasionally on other television programmes, as well as on various BBC radio programmes. In February 1957 he returned once again to the BBC to succeed Cecil McGivern as the Controller of Programmes at the BBC Television Service. He occupied this post for four years until 1961, when he was promoted to become the BBC's overall Director of Television. He remained in this role until 1968, when he reached the BBC's compulsory retirement age of sixty. Later years Following his retirement he often lectured on broadcasting matters at seminars in the United States, being made Visiting Professor of Communications at Temple University, Philadelphia. He also wrote a frank series of articles on his time at the BBC for the Sunday Times newspaper in 1969, and in later years was variously a Governor of Charing Cross Hospital; of the British Film Institute; a member of the councils of the National Youth Theatre; the Tavistock Institute; the British Travel Association and Industrial Design. In 1962 he had been awarded the CBE, and he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He was married to his wife, Ruth, from 1932 to her death in 1977. They had three sons and a daughter, the journalist Corinna Adam (later Ascherson), all of whom survived him.Pavan Amara (15 March 2012) \\"Rhyl Street flat blaze victim, Corinna Ascherson, an idealistic socialist once one half of ‚Äòjournalism‚Äôs golden couple‚Äô\\" , Camden New Journal References Category:1908 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:BBC One controllers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:English male journalists Category:People educated at Nottingham High School Category:Presidents of the Cambridge Union Category:Temple University faculty Category:The Guardian journalists Category:National Youth Theatre members ","title":"Kenneth Adam"},{"id":"2143416","text":"Twin Trading was an alternative trading company in the United Kingdom.

A defect detector is a device used on railroads to detect axle and signal problems in passing trains. The detectors are normally integrated into the tracks and often include sensors to detect several different kinds of problems that could occur. Defect detectors were one invention which enabled American railroads to eliminate the caboose at the rear of the train, as well as various station agents stationed along the route to detect unsafe conditions. The use of defect detectors has since spread to other overseas railroads. History Before the advent of automated detectors, on-board train crew and track-side workers used to visually inspect trains for defects e.g. \\"hotboxes\\" (overheating bearings) would smoke or glow red. By the 1940s, automatic defect detectors included infrared sensors for hotboxes, wires outlining the clearance envelope to detect high and wide loads, and \\"brittle bars\\"frangible bars mounted between the railsto detect dragging equipment. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers, where a stylus- and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; a defect would register a sharp spike on the graph and an alarm would sound or a visible signal would be given to the train crew. The first computerized detectors had lights indicating the nature of defect and a numeric display of the associated axle number. Seaboard Air Line was the first railroad to install defect detectors which \\"spoke\\" their results over radios carried by train crew. Later models allowed crews to interact with the detector using a touch tone function on their radios to recall the defect report. Today, defect detectors are typically part of the general monitoring platforms keeping track of train status.Andrew Grantham \\"Raising loads and lowering charges\\", European Railway Review,1 November 2003. A Defect Detector Would Sound Like This: (This was the read out of the Campville Defect Detector, located at Campville, Florida on the CSX Wildwood Subdivision, on April 6th, 2019.) CSX Equipment Defect Detector. Milepost 700.1. No Defects. No Defects. Total Axles 738. Train length 13764. Speed 45. End of Transmission Sensors Hotbox Detector The sensors installed at defect detector locations can include and are explained: = Hotbox = Hot boxes or Hot Bearing Detectors are used to measure the temperature of the journal bearings of a train. They typically consist of two infrared eyes on each side of the tracks looking up at the train's bearings. They register the radiation from every journal that passes over them. If a bearing reaches the maximum temperature for safe travel, the detector will flag and count it as a defect. = Dragging Equipment Detectors = A column of cones sits across the whole width of the railroad (just like a cross tie) attached to a switch. Anything dragging from the train will hit this cone, thus pushing it back, thus breaking a contact. It then returns to its normal position to prepare for anything else that might be dragging under the train. The detector will register this action and flag it as a defect. Brittle bars are still used elsewhere, but still have to be repaired. Over time, dragging equipment detector's metal flaps need to be replaced because of extensive damage to them. Single use systems typically involve a frangible engagement bar or a stainless steel wire/braid strung between the rails and typically outside the rails as well, fastened to the sleepers. If the bar or braid is hit by something it breaks, and the circuit break alerts that there is a dragging item. Auto-resetting systems typically involve a pivot pin system to allow the target to reset itself after a hit. = High Car or Shifted Load Detectors = Infrared beams are placed horizontally above the track (high car) or vertically next to the track (shifted load). Anything that breaks the beam will be counted as a defect. A high car detector is placed anywhere an excess height car could be routed onto a low clearance line. A shifted load detector is mainly found on railroads where double-stack trains are prevalent as the containers may become misaligned and present a hazard to bridge trusses or tunnel walls. = Wheel Impact Detectors = Wheel sensors along the tracks feel for flat spots on the train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too dangerous to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilize accelerometers, strain gauges, fiber optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalize these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty. A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors the condition of the wheel independent of sprung mass ‚Äì independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalized impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution. = Sliding/Hot Wheel Detector = Typically a length of side looking infrared detectors that can detect if a wheel has locked up and is sliding along the track or has had the brakes lock up causing the entire wheel to heat up. = Vehicle Imbalance Detectors (side-to-side and end-to-end) = These detectors are typically a crude weighbridge and/or WILD system, as they are only concerned with measuring weight differentials. They do not have to be as accurate as proper weighbridge or WILD systems, but just accurate enough to be able to average the weight of bogies during a train pass to calculate the relative balance of wagons, to establish if one rail is loaded unacceptably greater (in percentage) than the other. This is typically not performed on empty wagons because of the significant percentage imbalances that can be caused by fluctuations in weight due to bogie tracking geometry or hunting issues, which in terms of weight differentials are relatively accentuated compared to when a wagon is loaded. = Clearance Gauge Monitors = These detectors can use a variety of sensors (video, laser, infrared), but typically they are a safety curtain arrangement: a gantry over the rail with sensors to detect anything outside the Clearance Gauge. They therefore check the envelope of safety and alert if anything is detected outside of it. = Low Hose Detectors (air hose) = These systems are different than dragging equipment detectors, which are looking for anything dragging from the train connecting with the sleepers. Low Hose detectors are looking specifically between two wagons, to measure the droop of the brake hoses. The brake hoses need a bit of droop, but too much and they can hit or dislodge. Typically, these systems employ a vertical bar installed on one side of the track, with infrared sensors pointed across the track at a mate bar with receivers installed pointed back at the infrared beams. When a train goes past, the infrared sensors are looking in the coupling area specifically, and will alert if anything is detected in the area that is lower than acceptable. = Video/Image Inspection Systems = These systems rely on an array of video devices in various locations between the rails and either side of the track, looking for particular bogie components (such as brake beam, springs, friction wedges, etc) and this data is then put through image analysis to determine if there are maintenance issues. = Wheel Profile Systems = These are laser arrays installed between or in place of a sleeper. They point up at the wheel profile and measure the profile shape specifically, taking various measurements of angles and lengths. The systems also give differential measurements for the two wheels of a wheelset. = Bogie Performance Detectors = Bogie Performance Detector - TBOGI system Bogie performance detectors monitor bogie tracking geometry, and hunting (instability) behaviour. Bogie tracking geometry includes tracking position and angle of attack on a per-axle basis, as well as rotation, shift, inter-axle misalignment, and tracking error on a per-bogie basis. Bogie performance detectors can provide early detection of bogie defects, and early warning of derailment risks through flange climb or rail break. Bogie performance detectors most often use optical methods, and are installed adjacent to the track with wheel sensors clamped to the rails. = Rail Break Monitors = These detectors either inject frequencies into the rail, or rely on existing track circuits, to detect rail breaks. These detectors are most commonly used by high speed networks. = Rail Temperature Monitors = These detectors are a mesh of small detectors installed against a particular stretch of rail. The detectors are typically a mix of temperature sensors and strain gauges (so measure in degrees Celsius and kilonewtons force). They measure temperature and stress/tension on the rail, to make sure these measures do not go outside the bounds of structural integrity. These systems are initially calibrated to a particular ‚Äòneutral state‚Äô but measuring the rail with neutral compression (no pulling or pushing) and an agreed neutral ambient temperature. The system then measures the rail to detect if these parameters get too far from neutral state, and will alert if the rail is approaching a breach of structural integrity. = Ground Based Noise (GBN) = This is a combination of accelerometers on the track, and another accelerometer installed in the bedrock next to the track. The correlation of these measurements indicates how much track-born noise is propagating through the ballast into the bedrock strata. This correlates directly with the noise levels experienced by surrounding area. These systems are commonly installed near or inside tunnels. = Brake Block Detectors = These are distinct from generic video imaging systems, as they are dedicated to specifically imaging the band above the rail that contains the brake shoe. The system identifies the back plate of the brake shoe, and then works out how much brake block is left in millimetres. If the system detects no brake block beyond the back plate, the system typically identifies the pad as missing. Sensors for the wheel condition monitor = Weighing in Motion sensors for axle loads or imbalances. = = Wide-load Detectors = A bridge spans the railroad with two laser beams that shine down on each side of the passing train. Anything that cuts through the beam will be counted as a defect. This sensor may also be integrated into the high car detector. = Structure gauge & loading gauge = Gallery Image:CSX Columbus Subdivision Defect Detector 20.3.jpgA CSX defect detector housed in the far equipment shed.

This was known by the Vakavanua of Nayau, the Tui Nayau's representative on Nayau on hearing of the plot told his son who was a young fellow to go and hide himself at the bow of the Drua and on arrival on Lakeba to immediately sneak and find his way to what is now Nakorovusa the old village site and relate the account of an assassination plot to the Sau on the guise of a friendly visit by his elder brother. The Sau on hearing of the imminent attempt on his life summoned the Tongans who were at the present village site of Tubou to stage a mock ceremonial reception to the visiting party while a dispatched war party lay ambush within the vicinity of a conversation hearing distance from where the formal reception was taking place . This went on until it was ascertained that the visiting party had no doubt fallen for the trap when the war party fell on the unsuspecting assailants and thence Uluilakeba and his followers were clubbed at a site known to the present day where an Ivi (chestnut) tree stands.

Biography Fischart was born, probably, at Strasbourg (but according to some accounts at Mainz), in or about the year 1545, and was educated at Worms in the house of Kaspar Scheid, whom in the preface to his Eulenspiegel he mentions as his cousin and preceptor. He appears to have travelled in Italy, the Netherlands, France and England, and on his return to have taken the degree of doctor juris at Basel. Most of his works were written from 1575 to 1581. During this period, he lived with, and was probably associated in the business of, his sister's husband, Bernhard Jobin, a printer at Strasbourg who published many of his books. In 1581 Fischart was attached as advocate to the Reichskammergericht (imperial court of appeal) at Speyer. In 1583, he married and was appointed Amtmann (magistrate) at Forbach near Saarbr√ºcken. He died there in the winter of 1590‚Äì1591. Influence Thirty years after Fischart's death, his writings, once so popular, were almost entirely forgotten. Recalled to the public attention by Johann Jakob Bodmer and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, it was only around the end of the 1800s that his works came to be a subject of academic investigation, and his position in German literature to be fully understood. Fischart studied not only ancient literature, but also the literature of Italy, France, the Netherlands and England. He was a lawyer, a theologian, a satirist and the most powerful Protestant publicist of the counter-reformation period; in politics he was a republican. His satire was levelled mercilessly at all perversities in the public and private life of his time, at astrological superstition, scholastic pedantry, ancestral pride, but especially at the papal dignity and the lives of the priesthood and the Jesuits. He indulged in the wildest witticisms, the most extreme caricature, obscenity, double entrendre; but all this he did with a serious purpose. As a poet, he is characterized by the eloquence and picturesqueness of his style and the symbolical language he employed. He treats the German language with the greatest freedom, coining new words and turns of expression without any regard to analogy, and displaying, in his most arbitrary formations, erudition and wit. Works Das gl√ºckhafte Schiff von Z√ºrich (title page) Fischart wrote under pseudonyms; such as Mentzer, Menzer, Reznem, Huidrich Elloposkleros, Jesuwalt Pickhart, Winhold Alkofribas Wustblutus, Ulrich Mansehr von Treubach, and Im Fischen Gilts Mischen. There is doubt whether some of the works attributed to him are really his. More than 50 satirical works, in both prose and verse, remain, and are considered to be his authentic work. Among works believed to be his are: *Nachtrab oder Nebelkr√§h, a satire against Jakob Rabe, a Catholic convert (1570) *Von St. Dominici des Predigerm√∂nchs und St Francisci Barf√ºssers artlichem Leben, a poem with the expressive motto Sie haben Nasen und riechens nit (\\"Ye have noses and smell it not\\"), written to defend the Protestants against certain accusations, one of which was that Martin Luther held communion with the devil (1571) *Eulenspiegel Reimensweis (written 1571, published 1572) *Aller Praktik Grossmutter, after Rabelais' Prognostication Pantagrueline (1572, Johann Scheible ed. 1847) *Fl√∂h Haz, Weiber Traz, in which he describes a battle between fleas and women (1573, Scheible ed. 1848) *Affentheuerliche und ungeheuerliche Geschichtschrift vom Leben, Rhaten und Thaten der . . . Helden und Herren Grandgusier Gargantoa und Pantagruel, also after Rabelais (1575, and again under the modified title, Naupengeheurliche Geschichtklitterung, 1577) *Neue k√ºnstliche Figuren biblischer Historien (1576) *Anmahnung zur christlichen Kinderzucht (1576) *Das gl√ºckhafft Schiff von Z√ºrich (The Lucky Ship of Z√ºrich), a poem commemorating the adventure of a company of Z√ºrich arquebusiers, who sailed from their native town to Strasbourg in one day, and brought, as a proof of this feat, a kettleful of Hirsebrei (millet gruel), which had been cooked in Z√ºrich, still warm into Strasbourg, and intended to illustrate the proverb \\"perseverance overcomes all difficulties\\" (1576, republished 1828, with an introduction by the poet Ludwig Uhland) *Podagrammisch Trostb√ºchlein (1577, Scheible ed. 1848) *Philosophisch Ehzuchtb√ºchlein (1578, Scheible ed. 1848) *Bienenkorb des heiligen r√∂mischen Immenschwarms, &c.;, a modification of the Dutch De roomsche Byen-Korf, by Philipp Marnix of St. Aldegonde (1579, reprinted 1847) *Der heilig Brotkorb, after Calvin's Trait√© des reliques (1580) *Das vierh√∂rnige Jesuiterh√ºtlein, a rhymed satire against the Jesuits (1580) He also wrote a number of smaller poems. To Fischart also have been attributed some Psalmen und geistliche Lieder which appeared in a Strasbourg hymn-book of 1576.

The company offers an assortment of women's, men's, and children's apparel and accessories, including swimwear, outerwear, lounge-wear, bags, sweaters, denim, dresses, suiting, jewelry, and shoes. As of August 2016, it operated more than 450 retail stores throughout the United States. The company conducts its business through retail, factory, crew cuts, Madewell stores, catalogs, and online. On May 4, 2020, the company announced that it would apply for bankruptcy protection amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. History =Formation and catalog growth= In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations. Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. \\"Growth was explosive‚Äî25 to 30 percent a year,\\" Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years. In 1985, the \\"Clifford & Wills\\" brand was launched, selling women's clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line. In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds. The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality. =Name change and first stores= In 1983, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand. Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan. J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder. The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Spiegel. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales. In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as \\"a modern-day interpretation\\", targeted at younger women than their main brand. =Going public and then private again= A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio In 2006, the company held an IPO, raising $376 million by selling new shares equal to 33% of expanded capital. However, in 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP took J.Crew private again in a $3 billion leveraged buyout. On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms‚Äîincluding one that used to own J.Crew‚Äîcame as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a \\"significant\\" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares).J Crew makes deal Yahoo Finance Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder. As a result, the \\"go- shop\\" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement. In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/The-Law-Office-of- Joseph-bw-34721594.html?x=0&.v=1 After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them. =Recent= In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J.Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap \\"fast fashion\\" and \\"athleisure\\" items. In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online. In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property \\"out of the reach of lenders.\\" In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters. The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.LAUREN SHERMAN, Jenna Lyons Exits J.Crew businessoffashion.com APRIL 3, 2017 The brand's longtime head of menswear, Frank Muytjens, left the company that month as well,MAX BERLINGER, J.Crew and Frank Muytjens Have Parted Ways GQ 4/26/2017 and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.Hayley Peterson, J.Crew CEO out after 14 years ‚Äî here's where he says the company went wrong businessinsider.com June 5, 2017 Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.John Kell, J.

Also in 2017, Drexler approached Amazon Inc about selling J.Crew to the tech giant.J.Crew approached Amazon about a sale, chairman Mickey Drexler says Jason Del Rey, November 9, 2017 In the summer of 2017, the company avoided a bankruptcy filing by having bondholders do a debt swap tapping into its brand name value. The majority of the bondholders agreed to the deal, with several others failing to stop the deal with a lawsuit. The deal lowered the company's debt. In September 2018, J.Crew began selling its standalone \\"J.Crew Mercantile\\" brand on Amazon. On February 16, 2018, J.Crew hired Adam Brotman, a long-time Starbucks executive, as president and chief experience officer.J.Crew has hired the Starbucks executive who transformed the coffee chain into a tech innovator Jason Del Rey, February 16, 2018 Brotman's first major impact was launching \\"J.Crew Rewards\\", the company's first reward program independent of the company's credit card. The rewards program offers free shipping and $5 back for each $200 spent. In November 2018, J.Crew announced its CEO, James Brett, would step down and be replaced by an office of the CEO consisting of four senior executives from J.Crew. Brett took up the position in June 2017. The company released a press release stating Brett's departure was a \\"mutual agreement\\" between Brett and the company's board of directors. Brett will be replaced by Michael Nicholson (president and COO), Adam Brotman (president and chief experience officer), Lynda Markoe (chief administrative officer), and Libby Wadle, president of Madewell Brand. The new office of the CEO will be responsible of managing J.Crew's operations as the board establishes a permanent management structure. On November 29, J.Crew announced the dissolution of their Nevereven, Mercantile, and J.Crew Home sub-brands. On April 11, 2019, J.Crew announced that president and COO, Michael Nicholson, will retain the title of interim CEO, along with the subsequent announcement of Brotman's departure. J.Crew reported a net income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up from a net loss of $74.4 million in quarter four of 2018. On January 28, 2020, the retailer announced that Jan Singer will assume title of CEO. Singer was previously CEO of Victoria's Secret, Spanx and was an executive at Nike. She will replace Nicholson who will assume his previous position. On May 4, 2020, J.Crew filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the company had amassed enormous debt even before the outbreak. Chinos Holdings, Inc. and 17 affiliated debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Debtors have requested joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-32181. In September 2020, J Crew permanently closed all six of its UK stores after its parent group emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy following an approval plan to cut its debts. Retail stores J.Crew at South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Massachusetts The company operates 506 retail stores, including 203 J.Crew stores, 129 Madewell stores, and 174 J.Crew Factory (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2018. The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, the UK, and Hong Kong. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation. In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: \\"Classics\\" and \\"Collections.\\" \\"Collections\\" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while \\"Classics\\" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities. In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million. Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company's Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly. J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35. In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher. In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice- president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States. J.Crew in Markville Shopping Centre (now closed) In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario. In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall (now closed) and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, although some of these stores have been closed recently. J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta) Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013 (and now closed). In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto. In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street. In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia ‚Äì to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014. From 2016 to 2018, J.Crew Group has closed 96 J.Crew and J.Crew Factory retail locations. On March 2, 2020, J.Crew announced that it would pause the proposed Madewell IPO that was intended to be initiated on March 2. The company is considering a possible separation of J.Crew and Madewell into two separate companies. Marketing Historically, each year the company issued 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies. Beginning in 2017, the catalog began being released with fewer pages and fewer issues per year. J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as \\"size 000\\"., and for advertising them as \\"toothpick jeans\\". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing. The \\"size 000\\" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future, and if the method of labeling should be changed. In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, \\"Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink.\\" Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles, although author Jo B. Paoletti said that it was \\"no big deal\\".Macedo, D. (2011, April 11). J.Crew ad showing boy with pink nail polish sparks debate on gender identity. Retrieved November 25, 2014.

As his following swelled, he took on the name Ant√¥nio Conselheiro (Ant√¥nio the Counselor) and increasingly began to trouble the local authorities, who saw him as a MonarchistMadden, Lori: \\"The Canudos War in History\\", Luso-Brazilian Review, vol. 30, no. 2, Special Issue: \\"The World Out of Which Canudos Came\\". Winter 1993, pp. 5,6. and thus a threat to their legitimacy. =Settlement= In 1893, following a protest over taxation and a violent melee with the police forces in Masset√©, Conselheiro and his band settled on an abandoned farm called Canudos, so called because a plant, canudo-de-pita (scientific name Ipomoea carnea, its popular name referring to its hollow tubes, used for manufacturing smoking pipes) was common in the region. The place was named Belo Monte (Beautiful Mount) by Antonio Conselheiro, but the old name, Arraial de Canudos, prevailed. Over the years people from across Bahia, including landless farmers, former slaves, indigenous people and cangaceiros flocked to join him, and within a few years the fledgling settlement numbered 30,000 people (which made it the second largest urban center in Bahia behind SalvadorLevine, Robert M. ‚ÄúCanudos in the National Context.‚Äù The Americas (Oct., 1991), 207.) and had developed a leather exporting business.Madden, Lori: \\"The Canudos War in History\\", Luso-Brazilian Review, vol. 30, no. 2, Special Issue: \\"The World Out of Which Canudos Came\\". Winter 1993, p. 7. As a community, Canudos operated somewhat like a religious commune, with Ant√¥nio Conselheiro as the principal member and director. Canudos was a heavily religious settlement, under the sway of Antonio's fanaticism, but despite his fanaticism he did not assume any official position of authority. The settlement practiced common ownership, abolished the official currency, negated Brazilian national laws and participated collectively in the management of the town. Canudos was in essence a reaction against the contemporary Brazilian nation.Da Cunha, Euclides: \\"Rebellion in the Backlands\\", Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1944 Neither the local nor national government supported the settlement in Canudos. The local government of Bahia felt pressure from landowners to take action against the settlement because of labor shortages caused by migration. The Brazilian national government wanted a military expedition sent to destroy Canudos in the name of liberalism and progress.Johnson, Adriana. ‚ÄúThe War of the End of the World or the End of Ideology.‚Äù Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies (August, 2004). 223 In the words of one historian, \\"The mere existence of autonomous movements not subject to state control was antithetical to the national interest. Canudos stood for such autonomy, and therefore had to be destroyed.\\" =Suppression of the Community= The first three invasions were amply defeated by the villagers. However, in 1897, a considerably larger fourth invasion force managed to overwhelm the village. Their success was in part helped by the death, from dysentery, of Ant√¥nio Conselheiro, during the early stages of the siege. The Brazilian army showed no mercy, brutally massacring the survivors and destroying the entire village. An academician, Alvim Horcades, would thus describe the massacre: \\"Eu vi e assisti a sacrificar-se todos aqueles miser√°veis (...) e com sinceridade o digo: em Canudos foram degolados quase todos os prisioneiros (...) Arrancar-se a vida a uma criancinha (...) √© o maior dos barbarismos e dos crimes que o homem pode praticar.\\" (\\"I saw and witnessed the sacrifice of all those poor people (...) and I say with all sincerity: in Canudos almost all the prisoners were beheaded (...) To take the life of a little child (...) is the greatest of cruelties and crimes man can commit.\\") Post-War Canudos Today the area is submerged by water, the result of the Cocorob√≥ Dam project in the 1970s, which blocked the Vaza-Barris River and flooded the old city. At low water the ruins of the church that was once the village's centrepiece can occasionally be seen. Once a year, in October, a mass is held to commemorate those lost in what is known today as the War of Canudos. The municipality of Nova Canudos was built nearby, at latitude 09¬∫53'48\\" South and longitude 39¬∫01'35\\" West, and currently has around 13,000 inhabitants. The story of Canudos was told by war correspondent Euclides da Cunha in the book Os Sert√µes (1901; translated into English as Rebellion in the Backlands, 1944), which helped inspire and provide material for the novel The War of the End of the World by Peruvian Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa (1981). The conflict was also described at length by Peter Robb in \\"A Death in Brazil\\" (2004). In fictional form it appears in the novel \\"The First Garment\\" (1975) by a Georgian writer Guram Dochanashvili. The municipality contains the Canudos State Park, created in 1986 to commemorate the War of Canudos.

He was educated at the L√ºbeck gymnasium and the university of Kiel, with which he was connected for nearly 65 years. In 1830‚Äì1834 and 1838‚Äì1840 he travelled in Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt. In 1843 he was appointed professor of philology at Kiel and director of the archaeological museum founded by himself in co-operation with Otto Jahn. Forchhammer was an active democrat, and from 1871 to 1873 represented the progressive party of Schleswig-Holstein in the German Reichstag. His published works deal chiefly with topography and ancient mythology. His travels had convinced him that a full and comprehensive knowledge of classical antiquity could only be acquired by a thorough acquaintance with Greek and Roman monuments and works of art, and a detailed examination of the topographical and climatic conditions of the chief localities of the ancient world. These principles are illustrated in his Hellenika Griechenland Im Neuen das Alte (1837), which contains his theory of the origin and explanation of the Greek myths, which he never abandoned, in spite of the attacks to which it was subjected. According to him, the myths arose from definite local (especially atmospheric and aquatic) phenomena, and represented the annually recurring processes of nature as the acts of gods and heroes; thus, in Achill (1853), the Trojan War is the winter conflict of the elements in that district. Other similar short treatises are: * Die Gr√ºndung Roms (1868) * Daduchos (1875), on the language of the myths and mythical buildings * Die Wanderwangen der Inachostochter Io (1880) * Prolegomena zur Mythologie als Wissenschaft und Lexikon der Mythensprache (1891). Among his topographical works mention may be made of: * Topographie von Athen (1841) * Beschreibung der Ebene von Troja (1850), a commentary on a map of the locality executed by T. A. Spratt (see Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, xii., 1842) * Topographia Thebarum Heptapylarum (1854); Erkl√§rung der Ilias (1884), on the basis of the topographical and physical peculiarities of the plain of Troy. His Demokratenb√ºchlein (1849), in the main a discussion of the Aristotelian theory of the state, and Die Athener und Sokrates (1837), in which, contrary to the almost universal opinion, he upheld the procedure of the Athenians as perfectly legal and their verdict as a perfectly just one, also deserve notice.

After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, the conflict came to a brutal end in October 1897, when a large subsection of the Brazilian army overran the village, razed it and slaughtered nearly all its inhabitants. This conflict marks the deadliest civil war in Brazilian history. Background A view of the village of Canudos. Typical constructions such as the one in the foreground were very basic, made of mud and straw The conflict had its origins in the former settlement of Canudos (named by its inhabitants Belo Monte, meaning \\"Beautiful Hill\\" in Portuguese) in the semi-arid backcountry (or Sert√£o) of Bahia. In the late 19th Century, the region was desperately poor, with an economy based on subsistence agriculture and cattle raising, severely lacking infrastructure. The disenfranchised population drew equally from rural and urban portions of the region and represented a \\"broad spectrum of ethnic and economic origins\\". It was a fertile ground for the growth of dissatisfaction with the newly declared Republic, declared November 15, 1889 after a military coup against the ruling Emperor, Dom Pedro II, who was still beloved by the common people. This period was characterized by high levels of instability, as the military fought to put down revolts all over the country. It was, therefore, unpopular and dangerous to be branded anything other than Republican during this time. At the onset of this early Republican era, a man by the name of Ant√¥nio Vincente Mendes Macial, also known as Ant√¥nio Conselheiro (Ant√¥nio, the Counselor) began rising to prominence. He was one of the many religious figures that pilgrimed in the backcountry of Brazil. He would move from village to village with his followers, doing errands for the local communities and garnering support from small farmers. As an increasing number of supporters joined his cause, Conselheiro would gain the attention of the local land owners, who disapproved of his ideals. Conselheiro claimed to be a prophet, and predicted the return of the legendary Portuguese king Sebastian of Portugal (see Sebastianism). He held the belief that \\"it was the Monarch‚Äôs God-given right to rule\\", which caused him to be progressively branded as a Monarchist figure by the unstable Republic at the time. After wandering through the provinces of Cear√°, Pernambuco, Sergipe and Bahia, he would eventually decide to settle permanently in 1893 with his followers in the farming community of Canudos, near Monte Santo, Bahia on the Vaza-Barris River. Within two years, Conselheiro convinced several thousands of followers to join him in his prosperous religious community in the backlands of Bahia, eventually making it the second-largest urban center in Bahia at the time. Military campaigns =Initial military campaign= The 40th Infantry Battalion, sent from the Par√° province to quell the Canudos rebellion, 1897. A specific incident was the catalyst for Canudos‚Äô eventual destruction. Conselheiro had placed his usual order of wood from a neighboring business in Joazeiro to construct a new church. However, said order was not delivered, as it seemed that the new local judge, Arlindo Leoni, antagonized Conselheiro and thus prevented the delivery. Some canudenses then took it upon themselves to go to Joazeiro to claim the wood. The judge manipulated the situation by requesting police forces from state governor, Luis Viana, to defend his town against an \\"invasion\\" by Conselheiro and his people. Viana recounts that he had been informed by Leoni of \\"rumors which were current, and which were more or less well-founded, to the effect that the flourishing city in question [Juazeiro] was to be assaulted within a few days by Ant√¥nio Conselheiro‚Äôs followers.\\" While the troops were initially dispatched for the sole purpose of preventing assault, Leoni managed to convince their commander Pires Ferreira to march on Canudos. With scant information about terrain and the defensive resources of Canudos' population, a small, 100-man force commanded by Ferreira was sent towards the settlement on November 4, 1896. However, the canudenses marching from the religious settlement to Joazeiro surprised the troops at Uau√° and a fierce battle ensued. Estimates of the number of conselheiristas that engaged in the battle varied anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 men, and accounts report that they were armed with \\"old muskets, pikes, scythes, long poles, and implements of the land.\\" Despite some considerable losses, estimated at around 150 men, the canudenses defeated the soldiers and drove them off. The troops then retreated to Juazeiro and awaited reinforcements from the state of Bahia. The government and the media quickly picked up on the soldiers‚Äô loss in the backlands of Bahia. The media played an essential role in escalating the conflict; it spread rumors that the \\"anti- Republican\\" settlement was allied with other Monarchists to launch a \\"Restoration\\" movement. This increasingly unstable political climate, added to the scarcity of military resources in Bahia, led the provincial government to get national forces involved in order to crush the increasingly threatening settlement. Since the First Brazilian Republic had only recently been founded, it saw the rebel settlers as monarchist separatists, and a bad example and a threat to the new regime. The President of Brazil at the time, Prudente de Morais, ordered another punitive military expedition to Canudos, and the Brazilian Army began to prepare in November 1896. Facing similar problems that troubled the first expedition, a second 104-man force commanded by Ferreira attacked the settlement on November 21, 1896. It was fiercely defended, however, by a band of 500 armed men, shouting praises to Antonio Conselheiro and the monarchy. The Brazilian soldiers retreated after incurring severe losses and killing around 150 of the settlers, who were armed only with machetes, primitive lances and axes. =Second military campaign= The 24th Infantry Battalion in Canudos, 1897. The defeat of the Pires Ferreira campaign and the sensationalist reports about the ferocity and fanaticism of Canudos‚Äô inhabitants provoked an outcry, and calls for reprisals against the village, which continued to grow exponentially, which now numbered over 30,000 residents. On January 12, 1897, the republican troops, which comprised 547 men, 14 officers, and 3 surgeons left Juazeiro for Canudos. Their second clash against the conselheiristas occurred on January 18, and led to the death of 115 canudenses amd minimal losses on the army's side. After some initial success with artillery against the villagers' trenches, however, the soldiers were surrounded by more than 4,000 insurrectionists. Lacking ammunition, food and water, and unable to resist the rebels, who continued to fight despite heavy losses, the soldiers retreated once again to Monte Santo to await reinforcements. What was particularly striking about this expedition was the way in which the canudenses had claimed victory. The fighters completely destroyed areas within a radius of seven miles of Canudos: they burned ranches and farm buildings, creating a ring of scorched earth around the settlement. Amidst a background of journalistic war cries, the canudenses crushing victories led the national military and civilian authorities to label Canudos a serious threat to national order and the prestige of the armed forces and the new government. =Third military campaign= Ruins of Bom Jesus church after the destruction of Canudos, 1897. An experienced colonel, Ant√¥nio Moreira C√©sar, set out with three infantry battalions, one cavalry and one artillery battalion, all newly armed and trained. On February 20, backed with 1,300 troops, Moreira arrived to Monte Santo. A day later, completely disregarding \\"the intense heat and parched land,\\" a little over a thousand armed men advanced on Canudos. The military forces reportedly carried \\"seventy rounds of cannon-balls and sixteen million rounds of ammunition.\\" Although forewarned about the numbers and resolve of the rebels, the military thought it impossible that the rebels would resist such a strong regular army force. However, their equipment quickly turned out be inadequate for the Sert√£o of Bahia. Wagon trains that carried supplies \\"sank up to their hubs in sand.\\" The troops nonetheless continued their forced march to Canudos, to which they fired cannon-balls at upon arrival. However, the bombings had turned the settlement of huts into a \\"maze\\" that was impossible for the soldiers to navigate. On March 6, 1897, after only two days of fighting, the surviving officers had no choice but to vote to retreat. Moreira C√©sar's protests were overlooked, and he died before dawn due to a fatal wound. =Fourth expedition and final destruction of Canudos= A matadeira (The Killer), a British- manufactured cannon used in the War of Canudos by the Brazilian Army against the rebels. Pressured, the Federal government sent a new expedition under General Arthur Oscar de Andrade Guimar√£es, and with the direct involvement of the Minister of War, who personally visited Monte Santo, a city near Canudos which served as the gathering point for the large army force being assembled. Machine guns and large artillery pieces, such as mortars and howitzers, including a powerful Whitworth 32 (nicknamed Matadeira (Killer)) went with the 3,000-man force, and had to be hauled with enormous effort through the unforgiving roadless landscape. The troops set off on June 16. This time, the attackers were aided by the rampant hunger and malnutrition among the inhabitants of Canudos, the rebels' lack of weapons and ammunition, and the heavy losses they had suffered in the previous attacks. The first battalion consisted of 2,350 men, hundreds of whom were trapped by the canudenses and slaughtered. Fearing another failed expedition, the troops retreated to the town of Monte Santo. The second assault began a month later and involved over 8,000 soldiers. The troops encircled and starved the population of Canudos into submission. The last assault persisted until the beginning of October, when the military forces set off 90 dynamite bombs in the settlement, thus marking the defeat of the people of Canudos. Reports of the fighting state that hundreds of Canudos defenders and federal soldiers died every day. Throughout this expedition, an undetermined number of canudenses fled the settlement. Those who stayed, however, were fooled into surrendering with the promise of being spared. One of the forces' generals, however, had the men \\"rounded by soldiers, and hacked to death in front of hundreds of witness, including many of their wives and children.\\" Immediately after the final assault, soldiers \\"smashed, leveled, and burned all 5,200 in the settlement.\\" alt= It was eventually determined that Conselheiro had likely died of dysentery on September 22. Before Canudos was burned down and dynamited, Conselheiro's body was exhumed, the head was removed, and it was \\"displayed on a pike\\" to be \\"held high at the front of a military parade for all to see.\\" According to Peter Robb, it \\"was taken to the Medical Faculty of Bahia to be studied for abnormalities.\\" When all resistance ceased and \\"peace\\" was restored, only 150 survivors remained. The more attractive surviving women were reportedly taken captive and sent to brothels in Salvador. left Some authors, such as Euclides da Cunha (1902) estimated the number of deaths in the War of Canudos was ca. 30,000 (25,000 residents and 5,000 attackers) , but some argue that the real number may have been lower (around 15,000). According to Peter Robb, \\"[t]he foreign correspondents who covered what was soon being called the War of Canudos, as if it were a conflict between nations rather than the extermination of a tiny community within a single country, were nearly all embedded with the army of the Brazilian republic.\\" Euclides da Cunha did not see the fighting but did bear witness afterward, Robb says, and his \\"obsession with progress and modernity, the scientific racism that told him the people of the northeastern interior were doomed to backwardness by their mixed race\\" led him to tell a story filled with preconceptions- which is, however, the only story we have.  Canudos today  Although the original town of Canudos has been covered by the reservoir of the Cocorob√≥ Dam, built by the military regime in the 1960s, the Canudos State Park, established in 1986, preserves many of the important sites and serves as a monument to the war. The stated purpose of the park is to make it impossible to forget the martyrs led by Ant√¥nio Conselheiro. Bibliography * Calasans, Jos√©. No Tempo de Ant√¥nio Conselheiro.

With a circulation of 200,050 (as of April 2011), it was the country's biggest selling weekly, ahead of Newsweeks Polish edition, Newsweek Polska, and Wprost. Polityka has a slightly intellectual, socially liberal profile, setting it apart from the more conservative Wprost and the glossier approach of Newsweek Poland. Prominent editors and permanent contributors have included Adam Krzemi≈Ñski, Janina Paradowska, Daniel Passent, Ludwik Stomma, Adam Szostkiewicz, Jacek ≈ªakowski, Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Jerzy Urban, and Krzysztof Zanussi. History and profile Established in 1957, after Stalinism had subsided in Poland, Polityka slowly developed a reputation for moderately critical journalism, promoting economical way of thinking, although always remaining within the communist-imposed boundaries that still constrained the press. Notably, Polityka was launched to replace the more radical Po prostu (1947‚Äì1957). The first editor-in-chief of Polityka was Stefan ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski who served in the post from 1957 to 1958. Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski was a long-time editor of the publication and he served in the post between 1958 and 1982. It was he who would become the final First Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, the last communist prime minister of Poland, and who would eventually oversee the winding down of communist rule in Poland in 1989. Polityka supported the Round Table talks, which concluded with an agreement to hold the free elections that would result in a peaceful end to communist rule in Poland. The magazine achieved renown in 1961 when it printed five parts of Adolf Eichmann's memoires that had been stolen and given to it by anti-Nazis (the only other magazine that acquired fragments of these memoires was Life).Daniel Passent: Zbrodniarz na ≈Çamach, Polityka nr 10/2007 (2595) It earned the ire of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1983 after expressing a favorable view of political pluralism.Wies≈Çaw W≈Çadyka: Historia Polityki dla doros≈Çych, Polityka nr 9/2007 (2594) Jan Bijak became editor-in- chief of the magazine in 1982 and served in the post until 1994. After the fall of communism in 1989, Polityka continued to play an influential role as part of Poland's newly free press. In 1990, the Polityka team left the state- owned publisher RSW Prasa-KsiƒÖ≈ºka-Ruch with rights to the title, and established an independent cooperative called \\"Polityka\\" - Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Pracy. Such a publishing cooperative is unique in the Polish press. Since 1994, the editor of Polityka has been Jerzy Baczy≈Ñski. In 1995, the format was switched from a broadsheet to a standard colour magazine, which has more than 100 pages per issue. Circulation In 2001 Polityka had a circulation of 245,000 copies. The circulation of the magazine was 143,089 copies in 2010 and 133,324 copies in 2011. It was 124,761 copies in 2012. The print and e-edition circulation of the weekly was 127,732 in August 2014. Awards Since 1959, Polityka has awarded its History Award (for history book of the year), and, since 1993, an annual award for the arts, the Paszport Polityki. Since the late 1990s, it has also funded scholarships for young scientists.

It won two TVB Anniversary Awards, including Best Actor for Louis Koo and Best Actress for Jessica Hsuan. The series focuses on the lives of two detectives, Tsui Fei (Louis Koo) and Kong Chi Shan (Sunny Chan), and the murder cases they deal with. Story Because of his misbehavior, Tsui Fei (Louis Koo) is a sergeant sent to work with Senior Inspector Kong Tze Shan's (Sunny Chan) homicide team at the Hong Kong Central Police Station. He has been emotionally unstable since the disappearance of his girlfriend Leung Chin Chin (Anne Heung) three years earlier. At first, his attitude is not welcomed by the other officers, especially Hon Kwok Yan (Edmond So), but they soon get along. Fei and Tze Shan eventually become best friends. While investigating his first murder case, Fei meets psychologist Quin Mo Chiu Kwan (Jessica Hsuan) and the two fell in love. Because Fei still misses his ex-girlfriend, the two frequently quarrel. Tze Shan has a beautiful girlfriend, Man Yuen Lan (Charmaine Sheh), but Yuen Lan's best friend Tong Sum Yu (Lee San San) is also in love with him. Sum Yu tries hard to stop loving Tze Shan, until Yuen Lan's father Man Kwok Tai (Law Lok Lam) kills Leung Kim Hung (Kwok Fung) - Tze Shan's fellow officer and Chin Chin's brother - in order to frame an old enemy. Kwok Tai forces his daughter to assist his crime, but in the end they are both captured and sent to prison. Yuen Lan gives Tze Shan up because of this. Without Yuen Lan in the way, Sum Yu and Tze Shan quickly developed a relationship and even decided to marry. Yuen Lan has already been released from prison. Yuen Lan asked if they can have a chance to get back to together. Tze Shan said he already hurt Yuen Lan, and Yuen Lan will always be in his heart. He can't hurt another person. Tze Shan still chooses Sum Yu and Yuen Lan also accepts the truth. Meanwhile, Tze Shan's sister Kong Tze Ching (Maggie Siu) re-encounters her long-lost twin sister Tze Yiu (also played by Siu), but Tze Yiu turns out to be a lunatic and is involved with a murder case. Tze Ching tries to hide her but she cannot stop her from attending Tze Shan's wedding. Tze Yiu's emotions were stable at first but she suddenly has hallucinations of the man she murdered and tries to kill him with a knife. Unfortunately, her hallucinations appear right in front of Sum Yu who is stabbed to death as a result. Tze Shan is devastated and tries to rekindle his relationship with Yuen Lan, but Yuen Lan has decided to leave for Yunnan. Deep down, Tze Shan likes Yuen Lan more, but he felt bad because of what his sister did. Meanwhile, Chin Chin suddenly reappears, and Fei discovers that Chin Chin had been held captive by gangster Cheng Tung Shing (Roger Kwok) for all these years. Tung Shing was friends with Fei, when Fei was an undercover in the triads, but their friendship turned to hatred when Fei revealed his identity. Tung Shing managed to escape and swore revenge against Fei. He kidnapped Chin Chin for future use. Finally, Tung Shing is defeated and sent to jail. Fei reluctantly breaks up with Quin as he felt he had owed Chin Chin way too much. The last seconds of the show's finale hint that Quin has developed a relationship with Tze Shan.

Nevertheless, it still became one of the highest-rated series in the territory in 1999 when it was aired for the first time. Koo and Hsuan received the Favorite Actor and Actress Awards for the series in TVB's 32nd Anniversary respectively. Emilia's song Big Big World was featured in the show, and it became a great hit in Hong Kong during 1999 and 2000. The VCD box set of Detective Investigation Files IV is now available for sale worldwide. The ending scene This scene caused an uproar in Hong Kong, which later resulted in it being cut from overseas versions. The scene takes place in a bar, where Mo Chiu Kwan is sitting watching soccer on TV. Tsui Fei walks into the bar, sees her and asks why she is here. She answers that there are more men here. Tsui then takes a call (possibly from Chin Chin), while a man walks over to Kwan in the background. Tsui Fei looks over, not knowing who the guy is and smiles. The guy whispers something in Kwan's ear and they laugh. then his face is revealed and it's Kong Tze Shan! Tsui Fei's expression changes immediately. Many viewers were unsure if the expression was a sign of jealousy or just surprise.  Detective Investigation Files V?  Many people in Hong Kong were not satisfied with the ending of the series, when Tsui Fei left Mo Chiu Kwan for Leung Chin Chin, because they thought that he was responsible for the latter's suffering. TVB constantly receives requests to film the fifth in the series in which Tsui and Mo reunite, but so far there are no signs that it will happen. The reason to this may be due to the loss of most of the original cast. Sunny Chan left TVB shortly after filming the series, and Lee San San also stopped acting. Louis Koo also turned to cinema and singing a few years later. Although Sunny Chan returned to TVB in 2004 (and even starred in a drama with Jessica Hsuan), the Detective Investigation Files phenomenon had already faded by that time. Meanwhile, Jessica Hsuan and Charmaine Sheh are still two of TVB's most popular actresses.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2002. In the episode, the Simpsons family get arrested for domestic violence, prompting social worker Gabriel to move in and make the family functional. After the family is declared acceptable, Amber and Ginger, the cocktail waitresses Homer and his neighbor Ned Flanders married in Las Vegas, show up at their doorsteps. \\"Brawl in the Family\\" was directed by Matthew Nastuk and was the first full episode Joel H. Cohen received a writing credit for. It was the first episode on which Al Jean served as sole showrunner. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to produce a sequel to the season 10 episode \\"Viva Ned Flanders\\", which he thought had a \\"loose end\\". The episode features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm, and Delroy Lindo as Gabriel. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.8 million viewers, making it the 28th most watched program the week it aired. Later that year, the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Awards in the category \\"Television Episodic - Comedy\\", which it ultimately lost to the Dharma & Greg episode \\"Protecting the Ego-System\\". Following its home video release, \\"Brawl in the Family\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Plot The Republican Party of Springfield decide to make caring for the environment a felony offense; the resulting pollution causes an acid rainfall, destroying the Simpsons' TV antenna and prompting them to stay inside and play a game of Monopoly to pass the time. When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to pull her off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance. After a short time in jail, they are released by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to work together as a team to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home. Before the family can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway, causing Gabriel to storm off in disgust. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying her in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his marriage to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber, who attempts to seduce him by making him sandwiches, arousing Marge's jealousy. Amber also unsuccessfully tries to bond with Bart and Lisa, who resent her for destroying their family. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends the rest of the night trying to get it off, as Marge watches from the window and begins to have a change of heart. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and asks him to come inside to talk with her, although she is still angry at him over what he did. While Amber is lounging in a kiddie pool, she overhears Homer and Marge arguing about her, with Homer ultimately announcing that he is leaving Marge and the kids. Homer then invites Amber to Moe's for a night of drinking, while Marge and the kids eavesdrop from outside. The next day, a hungover Amber discovers that she is now married to Grampa Simpson, and the Simpsons have video evidence of the event about her vowing to forsake all other husbands when married to Grampa. Amber and Ginger, who is fed up with Ned, hurriedly drive back to Vegas. The family celebrates their victory through sticking together, while Grampa, at first despondent over Amber leaving him, quickly learns to be content with it. Production Actor Delroy Lindo, who guest-starred as Gabriel in the episode, was dissatisfied with the character's design. \\"Brawl in the Family\\" was directed by Matthew Nastuk and was the first episode Joel H. Cohen received a sole writing credit for. Cohen had previously received a credit for \\"Hex and the City\\", the first segment of \\"Treehouse of Horror XII\\" which aired the previous year. \\"Brawl in the Family\\" originally aired on January 6, 2002 on the Fox network. It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner. It was the second of his episodes to air however, since the Christmas-themed \\"She of Little Faith\\", the second episode he produced, was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to make a follow-up to the season 10 episode \\"Viva Ned Flanders\\". In it, Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun. While there, the two get intoxicated and wake up the next morning to find that they have married two cocktail waitresses, Amber and Ginger. The episode ends with Homer and Ned walking home from Vegas. Jean felt that the ending to \\"Viva Ned Flanders\\" was \\"a bit loose\\" because \\"...if you leave a wife in Vegas, they track you down.\\" He pitched \\"Brawl in the Family\\" in order to \\"resolve it [the ending to 'Viva Ned Flanders'].\\" Amber and Ginger were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively. \\"Brawl in the Family\\" features British actor and theater director Delroy Lindo as Gabriel, the social worker. According to Jean, Lindo was chosen to guest star because of his \\"great voice.\\" Gabriel was then designed to match Lindo's voice. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Lindo expressed dissatisfaction with the character's design. He said \\"Were I an audience member, looking at this [the episode] I'd think, 'That guy doesn't sound like he looks.'\\"Lindo, Delroy. (2010). Commentary for \\"Brawl in the Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. However, he added that his appearance in the episode earned him \\"much cred\\" among his nieces and nephews. In an interview with The A.V. Club, he said \\"After I did that voiceover, I was very aware of the power of The Simpsons, because in certain quarters, I got instant credibility.\\" The episode also features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm. Release On its original American broadcast on January 6, 2002, \\"Brawl in the Family\\" was watched by approximately 12.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It became the 28th most watched program of the week it aired, beating such shows as ABC's 8 Simple Rules and NBC's Crossing Jordan and Mister Sterling. Later that year, the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Award in the category \\"Television Episodic - Comedy\\", which it ultimately lost to the Dharma & Greg episode \\"Protecting the Ego- System\\". Its nomination was based solely on a scene in which \\"a bigger fish eats a smaller three-eyed fish\\", according to Jean, and because the award show was short on nominees. On August 24, 2010, \\"Brawl in the Family\\" was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Joel H. Cohen, Max Pross, Delroy Lindo, Matt Warburton and David Silverman participated in the audio commentary of the episode.Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \\"Brawl in the Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Following its home video release, \\"Brawl in the Family\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Aaron Peck of High- Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal, writing \\"Homer is always doing something that jeopardizes his marriage to Marge. When Homer's 'Vegas Wife' shows up unexpectedly [...] the same thing happens. This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome, but it still continues.\\" 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a \\"ridiculous set up\\". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it \\"Mannered to the point of ridiculousness.\\" While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing \\"it‚Äôs just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it‚Äôs just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time.\\" Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode \\"seems like two story fragments combined into one; it‚Äôs like the writers couldn‚Äôt flesh out either tale for an entire 22 minutes so they just stuck two half-programs together.\\" He added that it still \\"manages some laughs\\", and also argued that the episode was very similar to the season 1 episode \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home\\", which was also noted by Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk. Despite receiving mixed reviews, \\"Brawl in the Family\\" is often considered a fan favourite, and R. L. Shaffer of IGN called it one of the season's \\"gems\\". Cultural references The episode title is a reference to the American TV show \\"All In The Family\\". The Simpsons sing Sister Sledge's 1979 hit song \\"We Are Family\\" as they are driving home from their victorious trip to the forest. After the Simpsons sing the song, Gabriel references the 1946 movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" as he mentions earning his wings.

South Molton is the nearest town. The hamlet of Elwell lies to its north-east. History The manor was formerly part of the Fortescue Estate, owned by the Earls Fortescue of nearby Castle Hill, Filleigh. Earlier the manor together with the advowson of the church had been acquired by the influential Barnstaple merchant and MP John Delbridge (1564-1639). Access Most travellers reach West Buckland by a steep, winding, mostly single track hill up from the North Devon Link Road (A361). Facilities Until 2008 the village had a small post office; the post office is now held in the church on two afternoons a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays. West Buckland was one of the first villages in the country to arrange such a facility. The village has a refurbished village hall, and a garage. There is no public house, but the village hall now has a licensed bar which is opened during a considerable number of social events throughout the year. West Buckland School The village may be best known for having given its name to the adjacent co-educational independent West Buckland School: educators of, amongst others, England cricketer Harold Gimblett and British world record triple-jumper Jonathan Edwards. Despite taking the name, the school comprising its preparatory school, three boarding houses and the public school itself is located on an extensive campus about 1 km east of the village and instead it is the small parish church which draws most visitors from the local area. The daily school traffic includes a fleet of long coaches which pass through the narrow village street twice a day. West Buckland Festival Previously, there was a thriving, annual four-day \\"Festival of Music, Art and Entertainment\\", which included both international and local performers, a very successful Art and Craft Exhibition and various workshops. We regret to say that we no longer hold a Festival in the village.

One is an inequality involving the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of two sets of real numbers of the unit interval. The result was published on page 5 of the book Inequalities by Edwin F. Beckenbach and Richard E. Bellman (1961), who refer to an unpublished result of Ky Fan. They mention the result in connection with the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and Augustin Louis Cauchy's proof of this inequality by forward-backward-induction; a method which can also be used to prove the Ky Fan inequality. This Ky Fan inequality is a special case of Levinson's inequality and also the starting point for several generalizations and refinements; some of them are given in the references below. The second Ky Fan inequality is used in game theory to investigate the existence of an equilibrium. Statement of the classical version If xi with 0 ‚â§ xi ‚â§ \\\\frac{1}{2} for i = 1, ..., n are real numbers, then : \\\\frac{ \\\\bigl(\\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\bigr)^{1/n} } { \\\\bigl(\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1-x_i)\\\\bigr)^{1/n} } \\\\le \\\\frac{ \\\\frac1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i } { \\\\frac1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (1-x_i) } with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = . . . = xn. Remark Let :A_n:=\\\\frac1n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i,\\\\qquad G_n=\\\\biggl(\\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\biggr)^{1/n} denote the arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively, of x1, . . ., xn, and let :A_n':=\\\\frac1n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (1-x_i),\\\\qquad G_n'=\\\\biggl(\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1-x_i)\\\\biggr)^{1/n} denote the arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively, of 1 ‚àí x1, . . ., 1 ‚àí xn. Then the Ky Fan inequality can be written as :\\\\frac{G_n}{G_n'}\\\\le\\\\frac{A_n}{A_n'}, which shows the similarity to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means given by Gn ‚â§ An. Generalization with weights If xi ‚àà [0,¬Ω] and Œ≥i ‚àà [0,1] for i = 1, . . ., n are real numbers satisfying Œ≥1 \\\\+ . . . + Œ≥n = 1, then : \\\\frac{ \\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{\\\\gamma_i} } { \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1-x_i)^{\\\\gamma_i} } \\\\le \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\gamma_i x_i } { \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\gamma_i (1-x_i) } with the convention 00 := 0. Equality holds if and only if either *Œ≥ixi = 0 for all i = 1, . . ., n or *all xi > 0 and there exists x ‚àà (0,¬Ω] such that x = xi for all i = 1, . . ., n with Œ≥i > 0\\\\. The classical version corresponds to Œ≥i = 1/n for all i = 1, . . ., n. Proof of the generalization Idea: Apply Jensen's inequality to the strictly concave function :f(x):= \\\\ln x-\\\\ln(1-x) = \\\\ln\\\\frac x{1-x},\\\\qquad x\\\\in(0,\\\\tfrac12]. Detailed proof: (a) If at least one xi is zero, then the left-hand side of the Ky Fan inequality is zero and the inequality is proved. Equality holds if and only if the right-hand side is also zero, which is the case when Œ≥ixi = 0 for all i = 1, . . ., n. (b) Assume now that all xi > 0. If there is an i with Œ≥i = 0, then the corresponding xi > 0 has no effect on either side of the inequality, hence the ith term can be omitted. Therefore, we may assume that Œ≥i > 0 for all i in the following. If x1 = x2 = . . . = xn, then equality holds. It remains to show strict inequality if not all xi are equal. The function f is strictly concave on (0,¬Ω], because we have for its second derivative :f(x)=-\\\\frac1{x^2}+\\\\frac1{(1-x)^2}<0,\\\\qquad x\\\\in(0,\\\\tfrac12). Using the functional equation for the natural logarithm and Jensen's inequality for the strictly concave f, we obtain that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ln\\\\frac{ \\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{\\\\gamma_i}} { \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1-x_i)^{\\\\gamma_i} } &=\\\\ln\\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{x_i}{1-x_i}\\\\Bigr)^{\\\\gamma_i}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\gamma_i f(x_i)\\\\\\\\\\\\ & where we used in the last step that the Œ≥i sum to one. Taking the exponential of both sides gives the Ky Fan inequality. The Ky Fan inequality in game theory A second inequality is also called the Ky Fan Inequality, because of a 1972 paper, \\"A minimax inequality and its applications\\". This second inequality is equivalent to the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, but is often more convenient. Let S be a compact convex subset of a finite-dimensional vector space V, and let f(x,y) be a function from S \\\\times S to the real numbers that is lower semicontinuous in x, concave in y and has f(z,z) \\\\le 0 for all z in S. Then there exists x^* \\\\in S such that f( x^*, y ) \\\\le 0 for all y \\\\in S. This Ky Fan Inequality is used to establish the existence of equilibria in various games studied in economics.

He was born in Amsterdam. In 1823 he was appointed as a librarian, and in 1833 as university librarian and honorary professor at Leiden University, where he remained until his death. Geel materially contributed to the development of classical studies in the Netherlands. He was the author of editions of Theocritus (1820), of the Vatican fragments of Polybius (1829), of the Olympikos of Dio Chrysostom (1840) and of numerous essays in the Rheinisches Museum and Bibliotheca critica nova, of which he was one of the founders. He also compiled a valuable catalogue of the manuscripts in Leiden University Library, wrote a history of the Greek sophists, and translated various German works into Dutch. In 1825 he became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

The character was created by Jack Kirby for 2001: A Space Odyssey #8 (July 1977), a comic written and drawn by Kirby featuring concepts based on the eponymous 1968 Stanley Kubrick feature film and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 novel. Shortly thereafter, Machine Man spun off into his own Kirby-created series. He is a robot, the only survivor of a series, raised as a human son of scientist Abel Stack, who was killed removing his auto-destruct mechanism, and further evolved to sentience by a Monolith. Publication history =Volume 1= Machine Man originally appeared in the pages of 2001: A Space Odyssey #8 (July 1977), which was written and drawn by Jack Kirby, where he was called Mister Machine. He went on to appear in his own self-titled series in 1978. This title featured Machine Man entering the mainstream Marvel Universe. Jack Kirby wrote and drew the first nine issues, which dealt with the title character's status as a fugitive from the military after the death of his creator, and his first interactions with mankind. The book was canceled at the end of 1978 with X-51 finally standing up to the military. Machine Man appeared next in a three issue story arc within the pages of The Incredible Hulk #235‚Äì237. The robot found himself battling the green giant within the suburban setting of his human friend, Dr. Peter Spaulding. By the end of the storyline, he incurred a complete system shutdown, leading to the events portrayed in his relaunched monthly series. The title was relaunched in issue #10 after a nine-month hiatus. Status quo in the book changed with Machine Man now living amongst humanity, and dealing with his own new-found emotions. Marv Wolfman came aboard as the new writer, partnered with artist Steve Ditko, which helped set a different tone from Kirby's previous stories. Issue 15 saw a new writer, Tom DeFalco, taking over the writing chores. The title lasted until issue #19, ending in February 1980. =Volume 2= In October 1984 ‚Äì January 1985, the Machine Man title was resurrected, in a four-issue miniseries written by Tom DeFalco with art by Herb Trimpe (breakdowns only, issues #1‚Äì3) and Barry Windsor-Smith (finishes only, issues #1‚Äì3 and full art for issue #4), with Windsor-Smith also coloring the entire miniseries and co-plotting issue #4 with DeFalco. This series turned out to be one of the most popular of all the Machine Man titles, tying with previous continuity, but with the action set in the distant cyberpunk future of 2020, starting with Machine Man's reassembly. The miniseries was first reprinted as a 96-page trade paperback in 1988 (), with brand new cover art by Barry Windsor-Smith. The miniseries was republished again in 1994 as two double-size books, with the name Machine Man 2020. Characters from this alternate future have made appearances in other Marvel books, namely Arno Stark, the mercenary Iron Man 2020. In 2013, many of Arno Stark‚Äôs adventures were collected in the Iron Man 2020 TPB, which included all 4 issues of Machine Man volume 2. =Volume 3= In 1999, Marvel brought the character back in the series X-51, The Machine Man in which Machine Man experiences a programming malfunction: he would uncontrollably attack any mutant he encountered. He was given a drastically more robotic look and his powers were vastly changed. The reason for both was that he had been reconstructed by Sentinel-based nanotechnology. The series lasted twelve issues; in the final one, he was 'recovered' by a Celestial, as the Celestials‚Äîrevealed to be the power behind the Monoliths‚Äîhad become interested in Machine Man. Fictional character biography Machine Man, whose real name is Z2P45-9-X-51, was the last of a series of sentient robots created at the Broadhurst Center for the Advancement of Mechanized Research in Central City, California, by robotics expert Dr. Abel Stack for the US Army. However, all previous 50 experimental robots went mad as they achieved sentience and became psychotic, due to a lack of identity. X-51 was the only survivor, as he was treated as a son by Stack and given a human face mask as well as being exposed to one of the monoliths from 2001. After Stack died trying to protect him, X-51 assumed the human name Aaron Stack and escaped confinement, only to be relentlessly pursued by the army. X-51 named himself Mister Machine in issue #9 of the 10-issue run of 2001. While on the run, the newly christened Machine Man initiated contact with humanity in order to better understand it.2001: A Space Odyssey #8 After being captured and later freed, Machine Man was found by psychiatrist Peter Spaulding. He also battled Col. Krag's troops.Machine Man (vol. 1) #1‚Äì2 Soon after that, he first encountered Curtiss Jackson.Machine Man (vol. 1) #6 Alongside the Hulk, he battled Curtiss Jackson.Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #235‚Äì237 Soon after that, he was redesigned and rebuilt by Dr. Oliver Broadhurst.Machine Man (vol. 1) #10 He then first encountered the Fantastic Four.Machine Man (vol. 1) #15 He then met mechanic \\"Gears\\" Garvin, and then battled Baron Brimstone.Machine Man (vol. 1) #16 He also battled Madame Menace (Sunset Bain).Machine Man (vol. 1) #17 He then first encountered Aurora, Northstar, and Sasquatch of Alpha Flight.Machine Man (vol. 1) #18 Spaulding and Garvin set up Machine Man with a human identity as Aaron Stack, insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company,Machine Man (vol. 1) #11 but he continued having adventures as a superhero on the side. In Iron Man #168 (March 1983), Machine Man attempts to pay Iron Man a visit. Machine Man was seeking to compare notes with Iron Man, thought to be a robot by Machine Man. At the time, Iron Man was drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of Obadiah Stane. Iron Man attacked Machine Man and almost killed two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushed them out of the way.Iron Man #168 (March 1983) In a meeting with the Thing of the Fantastic Four, Machine Man also first met and fell in love with another sentient robot, Jocasta. Alongside the Thing and Jocasta, he battled Ultron. However, during the battle, Machine Man witnessed the seeming destruction of Jocasta by Ultron.Marvel Two-in-One #92‚Äì93 In 1990, Machine Man guest-starred in Iron Man Annual #11 (part of the \\"Terminus Factor\\" storyline). That story created strong hints that the 2020 Machine Man may turn out not to be the true X-51, but instead a duplicate created by Sunset Bain. The story concludes in Thor Annual #15, also in 1990. He later fought alongside the Avengers, which led to the invitation to become a team reservist. Later he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., who wanted to use his technology to create another Deathlok. He helps the X-Men and Douglock against the villainous Red Skull, who had taken over the Helicarrier where Machine Man was held.X-Men Annual '99 He helped the X-Men again against Bastion and his Sentinels. As a consequence, he was infected by Sentinel programming, assuming a more robotic look in the subsequent series X-51, and losing self-control whenever he was faced with a mutant. During this series he was on the run from Sebastian Shaw, who wants his technology for himself. Because of his new programming, while seeking aid from the Avengers, he attacks Justice and Firestar. Because of his actions against Justice and Firestar, X-51's membership in the Avengers is revoked. At the end of X-51, X-51 encountered one of the monoliths and disappeared, brought into the presence of the monolith's creators, the cosmic beings known as the Celestials. =Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.= Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen's Nextwave series sees Machine Man join a team formed by the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation¬©) to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction. Now preferring simply to be called Aaron, Machine Man is partnered with Monica Rambeau, Tabitha Smith, Elsa Bloodstone, and The Captain,Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #1 and the team soon discovers that H.A.T.E. are funded by the Beyond Corporation¬©, leading them to go rogue and carry out their mission on their own prerogative. Aaron Stack Calling humans \\"fleshy ones\\" and expressing a degree of pride in his \\"roboty parts\\" ‚Äî which he uses to kill Fin Fang FoomNextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #2 ‚Äî Aaron has developed a fondness for alcohol, stating \\"My robot brain needs beer\\" on regular occasions. He is not especially popular with his teammates because of his self-important attitude, and, as is learned in a flashback that after being brought to space by the Celestials at the conclusion of his previous series, he was dumped back on Earth because the space-gods considered him to be a \\"complete and utter ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†.\\"Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #5 (\\"‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†\\" representing an unspecified, but extremely offensive, profanity throughout the Nextwave series) He appears to have a rather serious attraction to Elsa Bloodstone and stares at her chest constantly, much to her chagrin. It is revealed that, when still an agent of H.A.T.E, Aaron would often sneak into Dirk Anger's room to steal beer until he found out what Anger made it out of (\\"I thought Lizard Squeezings was a brewery name.\\").Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #6 He later uses his knowledge of Dirk's quarters to steal Anger's mother's dress and hold it hostage in exchange for the safe escape of Nextwave. Later appearances in the Marvel Comics Presents mini-series (vol.2) suggest that X-51's memories of his time with the Celestials may be skewed, as he experienced visual hallucinations (?) of a miniature Celestial helping him overcome his psychological issues. =The Initiative= thumb Machine Man appears in a flashback to Iron Man (vol. 1) #168 (March 1983) in Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties of War. In trying to convince Captain America of the rightness of his position, Iron Man tells of the time Machine Man came to visit him. Machine Man was seeking to compare notes with Iron Man, thought to be a robot by Machine Man. Drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of Obadiah Stane, Iron Man attacks Machine Man and almost kills two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushes them out of the way. Iron Man uses this incident as the need for accountability in the superhero population. Aaron and Sleepwalker are recruited to aid Ms. Marvel in finding her teammate Ara√±a as part of a S.H.I.E.L.D. strikeforce known as Operation Lightning Storm. In the promotional cover for this appearance, he is in the costume which he wore during Nextwave. His appearance is entirely in keeping with Nextwave: he wears the same costume and displays the same nonsensical and zany personality developed, in place of his previous logical and friendly self. He reveals that Agent Maria Hill from S.H.I.E.L.D. offered him financial compensation to join the Initiative, enraging Ms. Marvel, who had supported it from the beginning, for free. He spends much of his time in Chile and aboard the Minicarrier 13, Ms. Marvel's headquarters at the time, antagonizing and criticizing every available agent. In addition to financial compensation, S.H.I.E.L.D. has also provided Aaron with a Life Model Decoy of Monica Rambeau, which is programmed to cry for him.Ms. Marvel 26 Keeping him in his new role of comic relief, Aaron has been shown using the LMD body as a replacement part for his damaged body, going so far to offer womanly advice to a deeply shocked Ara√±a.Ms. Marvel 21 =Marvel Zombies= Machine Man appears twice in the Marvel Zombies universe, initially in a cameo as part of the Nextwave team who engage in battle against the infected heroes and are killed off panel in Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness, and as the main character in Marvel Zombies 3. As the main character, Machine Man accepts an assignment on behalf of A.R.M.O.R. to accompany Jocasta to retrieve a blood sample from a living human from the Marvel Zombies universe, and the two are transported there by Portal.Marvel Zombies 3 #1 At first he wants to complete his mission only for the money, until he discovers that the zombies are cloning humans for food, much as humans use his fellow robots only for their own needs. He obtains cell samples from the Kingpin's wife Vanessa, who is still alive and being kept safe by the Kingpin.Marvel Zombies 3 #2 Machine Man delivers the samples to Jocasta, but the zombies nearly destroy him in retribution, and Portal and Jocasta are forced to leave his ruined body in that dimension.Marvel Zombies 3 #3 After Machine Man reveals that it was a holographic projection of himself, he fights off some zombies and captures the zombie Lockjaw who he uses to teleport back to his own dimension. Disposing of the remaining zombies within the facility, Machine Man and Jocasta are assigned back to S.H.I.E.L.D.Marvel Zombies 3 #4 He retains his personality as displayed in Nextwave and Ms Marvel in this series, however when Jocasta describes him as different from the person she once knew, he gives an explanation. Describing his earlier, friendly personality as being linked to \\"unresolved Oedipal issues\\", he claims to have grown tired of saving people over and over again to earn their love, as he loved them. Since that never happened (he claims), he has \\"modeled myself after the fleshies now. I look out for Number One, just like them\\".Marvel Zombies 3 #2 However, at the end of the series, as he wipes out the last remaining zombies, he declares, \\"No, you know what? My name is Machine Man and I just saved the ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†ing world!\\" accepting the name he spent much of Nextwave and this series denying.Marvel Zombies 3 #4 In Marvel Zombies 5, he teams up with Howard the Duck. They later work with and befriend Jacali Kane, daughter of an alternate-universe Hurricane. The trio travel the multi-verse fighting zombies; their intentions are to gather samples from biologically differing zombies in other to gain a cure.Marvel Zombies 5 #1‚Äì5 (2010) He is dismayed by Jocasta's decision to marry Ultron.Marvel Zombies 5 #3 =Working with Red Hulk= Under orders from Captain Steve Rogers, Machine Man teams up with Red Hulk, who is tracking down a Qatari rebel named Dagan Shah (whom Red Hulk believed to be behind the death of his old friend Will Krugauer).Hulk (vol. 2) #43 Machine Man and Red Hulk arrive in Sharzhad where they find Dagan Shah in the disguise of Arabian Knight, who lets them through the force field and leads them to his palace. Once inside the palace, Dagan Shah sheds his disguise, reveals his true identity as the Sultan Magus, and imprisons Red Hulk and Machine Man, as it is shown that the real Arabian Knight is imprisoned in a crystal.Hulk (vol. 2) #44 Red Hulk and Machine Man escape when Sultan Magus travels to Cairo after probing Red Hulk's mind to find out who could have sent Red Hulk to Sharzhad. Machine Man reveals to Red Hulk that Sultan Magus has used Rigellian technology to manipulate hydrogen, which involved providing a supply of water and terraforming a part of the desert for Sharzhad. When Sultan Magus returns, he attacks Red Hulk and Machine Man. Sultan Magus rips Machine Man in half.Hulk (vol. 2) #45 When Arabian Knight is freed from his imprisonment, Red Hulk and Machine Man continue their fight with Sultan Magus until General Reginald Fortean arrives and ends the fight. Fortean states to Red Hulk and Machine Man that Sharzhad has been recognized as a nation by the Arab League upon Sultan Magus agreeing to stop the weapons trading and states that they are trespassing. Sultan Magus then orders Red Hulk and Machine Man to get out of Sharzhad while he secretly plans to have his revenge on Red Hulk someday.Hulk (vol. 2) #46 Following an altercation with Red She-Hulk, Machine Man and Red Hulk track Zero/One to her floating island base Ogygia. As Red Hulk and Machine Man are fighting Zero/One's genetically-engineered sea monsters, Zero/One sends Black Fog to fight Machine Man and Red Hulk.Hulk (vol. 2) #47 Using a device given to him by Jacob Feinman, Machine Man disables Zero/One's drones and frees Black Fog from Zero/One's control as Black Fog leaves the area, stating that his debt is paid.Hulk (vol. 2) #48 Machine Man and Red Hulk arrived in Hawaii to fight a genetically-engineered Hydra that was created by Zero/One.Hulk (vol. 2) #49 =Marvel NOW! (2016)= As part of the 2016 Marvel NOW!, Machine Man appeared as an employee of Umbral Dynamics.Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol. 2 #3 Machine Man later appears as a member of Domino's incarnation of the Mercs for Money.Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol. 2 #4 During the \\"Iron Man 2020\\" event, Machine Man appears as a member of the A.I.

When he finally catches up to Jocasta, he is taken down by a new X-series robot model named X-52.2020 Machine Man #1. Marvel Comics. Despite being at a disadvantage, Machine Man defeated X-52 and beheaded Jocasta while making off with her still-active head.

Powers and abilities Machine Man was constructed by unnamed computer engineering specialists under Dr. Oliver Broadhurst at the Broadhurst Center for the Advancement of Mechanized Research; Dr. Abel Stack was his chief programmer. Machine Man's robotic materials, design, and construction (titanium alloy) provide him with a number of abilities, as does his adamantium composition. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes. He is an expert on his own construction and repair. Machine Man has superhuman visual acuity. He possesses an above normal intellect, with a capacity for unlimited self-motivated activity, creative intelligence, and human-like emotions. He has superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, including the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. Machine Man is powered by solar energy. He can also draw power from several different external-energy sources, if needed. Machine Man has the ability to telescope his arms and legs to a length of . Machine Man's hands are equipped with variable-payload fingers, some routinely carried in his fingers, others stored in hidden recesses in his belt. His fingers contain a different variety of devices, including: gas chromatograph, laser interferometer, micro-pulse radar, audiometer, seismometer, gravity-wave detector, pulse-code modulator, standard-computer input/outputs, radio beacon, all-wave transceiver, laser- cutting torch/weapon, and projection of heat, cold, or electricity; one of his fingers has been shown to contain a bullet-firing mechanism that uses .357 Magnum ammunition. He has the ability of flight under his own power through the means of anti-gravity disks. During the X-51 series, Machine Man had a few extra features thanks to nanotechnology within him at the time. This mainly included parts of himself being rebuilt if damaged, also causing many changes in his look from issue to issue. He also had a beam cannon on his chest. In Nextwave, he has become a living Swiss Army knife of sorts, containing various tools and weapons for a multitude of situations, both useful and esoteric. When asked if he could impregnate a human woman from several feet away, Aaron simply states \\"I am full of very useful devices.\\"Nextwave Vol 1 #2 In the Point One event, as many other heroes, Machine Man was slightly revamped, gaining new powers and abilities. Now being a cross between the nano- technlogical being in the X-51 miniseries and the living Swiss Army knife of Nextwave, Machine Man is now suffused with nanites able to effortlessly change his appearance from his earliest, jump-suited look to the more-humanoid looks of Nextwave. Also, his nanotechnology allows him to transform and rebuild every piece of machinery he comes in contact with, such as building an anti- gravity vehicle out of a motorcycle. Other versions =Delmar Insurance= In Nextwave #10, Forbush Man forces each member of Nextwave to experience life in 'Forbush Vision'; they were cursed to suffer in a boring or mundane personal hell. Aaron's nightmare was life as an insurance adjuster for Delmar Insurance in Central City, USA. Bashing his head into a personal computer several times out of depression, he decapitates himself...only to answer the phone a moment later. Stack is freed from the nightmare by the intervention of fellow Nextwave member Tabitha Smith.Nextwave #10 (January 2007) =Earth X= Machine Man was also one of the main characters of the Earth X trilogy. Transformed by a monolith into a transparent version of himself, Aaron was forced to become the new Watcher by a blind Uatu, the previous Watcher, who had not viewed any event on the planet for 20 years. Tricking Uatu, who had attempted to force Machine Man to reject his humanity, Machine Man managed to use his access to Watcher technology and data to help humanity defeat the coming Celestials, by revealing to Earth's superhero community the true origins of mankind. After defeating the Celestials, Machine Man used his newfound position to contact parallel Earths to help them eradicate the Celestial menace. =Marvel Zombies= Aside from his mainstream version having traveled to this universe, Machine Man and his Nextwave counterparts are also a team in this reality; they are destroyed off-panel by the zombie Power Pack.Marvel Zombies Versus The Army of Darkness #3 The classic version of Machine Man also appears in Marvel Zombies Dead Days in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. He is part of a last-ditch super-team gathered to fight the zombies.Marvel Zombies Dead Days (July 2007) =Machine Man 2020= Machine Man was reactivated in the year 2020 by a group of outlaw scavengers called Midnight Wreckers (led by X-51's old friend Gears Garvin), and forced to battle his old enemy, the industrialist ice queen Sunset Bain, as well as mercenary Arno Stark, the amoral Iron Man of 2020.Machine Man (vol. 2) #1‚Äì4 =Earth X= In Paradise X: Heralds #1, Iron Man 2020 claimed to the Earth X Machine Man that he had killed Machine Man 2020, despite the miniseries clearly depicting Arno Stark's decisive defeat at Machine Man's hands. (The Earth X universe is a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe.Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 6: Fantastic FourOfficial Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes (2005)) =Queen's Vengeance= When Morgan le Fay restructured reality in volume three of Avengers #1‚Äì3, nearly all Avengers, past and present, were transformed into the Queen's Vengeance, a sort of medieval-themed Avengers. Machine Man became Sir MacHinery, an obvious play on the word machinery. He can be seen on the cover of issue #2, behind Hercules.Avengers #1‚Äì3 (1998) =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Machine Man is Danny Ketch, who sacrificed his life during Galactus' assault on Earth. Danny Ketch's consciousness is later revealed to have survived inside a robotic body formed from salvaged Gah Lak Tus tech and is dubbed \\"Machine Man\\" by Phil Coulson.Cataclysm: Ultimates #3 In other media In the Spider-Man Unlimited animated TV series, the Machine Men (all voiced by Dale Wilson) serve as the High Evolutionary's enforcers on Counter- Earth. Spider-Man saved a Machine Man named X-51 from disassembly in the episode \\"Steel Cold Heart\\" and he joined forces with Spider-Man and the Human Rebels in their struggle against the High Evolutionary's regime. This robot is one of a group of Machine Men, who switches sides after not wanting to be scrapped following serious damage in a battle. The design of these Machine Men is somewhat reminiscent of the original Machine Man, especially in terms of color and abilities. However, they are substantially bulkier than Machine Man's human sized physique, drawing inspiration from the design of the Sentinels from X-Men comics or animated series.. Controversy Despite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in- Chief Joe Quesada stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity. However, recent issues of Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, as well as Civil War: Battle Damage Report, consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity. As noted above, subsequent appearances by Stack have used the Nextwave portrayal.

The pines were planted for timber production for the Zomba Sawmill, which is located at the southern slopes of the mountain. Where indigenous trees are left, severe deforestation due to the high demand for firewood in the region is a problem. Fruits like strawberries, yellow-berries and blackberries are grown on the mountain for the local market. The Zomba Plateau is the region's major tourist attraction. Activities offered include hiking, horse riding, rock-climbing, fishing and mountain-biking. A paved all-weather road leads from Zomba on the plateau.

They are also called liberins () and statins () (respectively), or releasing factors and inhibiting factors. The examples are hypothalamic- pituitary hormones that can be classified from several viewpoints: they are hypothalamic hormones (originating in the hypothalamus), they are hypophysiotropic hormones (affecting the hypophysis, that is, the pituitary gland), and they are tropic hormones (having other endocrine glands as their target). For example, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is released from the hypothalamus in response to low levels of secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. The TSH in turn is under feedback control by the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. When the level of TSH is too high, they feed back on the brain to shut down the secretion of TRH. Synthetic TRH is also used by physicians as a test of TSH reserve in the pituitary gland as it should stimulate the release of TSH and prolactin from this gland. The main releasing hormones are as follows: * The hypothalamus uses thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH or thyroliberin) to tell the pituitary to release thyrotropin. * The hypothalamus uses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH or corticoliberin) to tell the pituitary to release corticotropin. * The hypothalamus uses gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH or gonadoliberin) to tell the pituitary to release gonadotropin. * The hypothalamus uses growth hormone‚Äìreleasing hormone (GHRH or somatoliberin) to tell the pituitary to release somatotropin. The main release-inhibiting hormones or inhibiting hormones are as follows: * The hypothalamus uses somatostatin to tell the pituitary to inhibit somatotropin and to tell the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit various gastrointestinal hormones. There are various other inhibiting factors that also have tropic endocrine inhibition activity. Such activity is only one of many functions that they have (such as neurotransmitter and receptor antagonist roles), and they are not always called hormones, although many are neuropeptides or neurosteroids. They include the following: * The hypothalamus uses dopamine as a prolactostatin to tell the pituitary to inhibit prolactin; it is also created elsewhere in the brain and the adrenal cortex as a neurotransmitter to affect many other systems. * The hypothalamus uses RFRP-3 in mammals or GnIH in avian species to inhibit GnRH. * The hypothalamus uses follistatin to tell the pituitary to inhibit follicle- stimulating hormone; it also has many other systemic effects. * Myocytes use myostatin to tell each other to inhibit myogenesis. * Melanocyte-inhibiting factor (melanostatin) inhibits release of other neuropeptides such as alpha- MSH and also has many other functions. * There is a neuropeptide called cortistatin and a class of steroidal cortistatins. Examples of releasing and inhibiting hormones for exocrine hormones are gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which regulate gastrin production. Mechanism Releasing hormones increase (or, in case of inhibitory factors, decrease) the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca2+), resulting in vesicle fusion of the respective primary hormone. For GnRH, TRH and GHRH the increase in Ca2+ is achieved by the releasing hormone coupling and activating G protein coupled receptors coupled to the Gq alpha subunit, activating the IP3/DAG pathway to increase Ca2+.

Early life Gentz was born in Breslau. His father was an official, and his mother was distantly related to the Prussian minister Friedrich Ancillon. On his father's transfer to Berlin as director of the mint, the boy was sent to the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium there; his brilliant talents, however, did not develop until later, when at the University of K√∂nigsberg he fell under the influence of Immanuel Kant. Though his intellect was sharpened and his zeal for learning quickened by the great thinker's influence, Kant's categorical imperative did not prevent him from yielding to the taste for wine, women and gambling, which pursued him through life. When in 1785 he returned to Berlin, he received the appointment of secretary to the royal Generaldirectorium, his talents soon gaining him promotion to the rank of councillor for war (Kriegsrath). During an illness, which kept him virtuous by confining him to his room, he studied French and English, gaining a mastery of these languages, which opened up for him opportunities for a diplomatic career.  French Revolution  His interest in public affairs was, however, first aroused by the outbreak of the French Revolution. Like most quick-witted young men, he greeted it at first with enthusiasm, but its subsequent developments cooled his ardour and he was converted to more conservative views by Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, the translation of which into German (1794) was his first literary venture. This was followed, the next year, by translations of works on the Revolution by Mallet du Pan and Mounier, and he also founded and edited a monthly journal, the Neue deutsche Monatsschrift in which, for five years he wrote, mainly on historical and political questions. He maintained the principles of British constitutionalism against those of revolutionary France. The knowledge that he displayed of the principles and practice of finance was especially remarkable. In 1797, at the instance of English statesmen, he published a translation of a history of French finance by Francois Divernois (1757‚Äì1842), an eminent Genevese exile naturalized and knighted in England, extracts from which he had previously given in his journal. His literary output, all inspired by a moderate liberalism, was astounding, and it included an essay on the results of the discovery of the Americas, and another, written in French, on the English financial system (Essai sur l'√©tat de l'administration des finances de la Grande-Bretagne, London, 1800). Especially noteworthy, however, was the Denkschrift or Memorandum he addressed to King Frederick William III on his accession (1797), in which, inter alia, he urged upon the king the necessity for granting freedom to the press and to commerce. For a Prussian official to venture to give uncalled-for advice to his sovereign was a breach of propriety not calculated to increase his chances of favour, but it gave Gentz a conspicuous position in the public eye, which his brilliant talents and literary style enabled him to maintain. Moreover, he was from the first aware of the probable developments of the Revolution and of the consequences to Prussia of the weakness and vacillations of her policy. Opposition to France was the inspiring principle of the Historisches Journal founded by him in 1799 and 1800, which once more held up English institutions as the model, and he became in Germany the mouthpiece of British policy towards the revolutionary aggressions of the French Republic. In 1801, he ceased the publication of the Journal because he disliked the regularity of journalism. He issued instead, under the title Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte, etc., a series of essays on contemporary politics. The first was √úber den Ursprung und Charakter des Krieges gegen die franz√∂sische Revolution (1801), regarded by many as Gentz's masterpiece; another important brochure, Von dem politischen Zustande von Europa vor und nach der Revolution, a criticism of Hauterive's De l‚Äôƒótat de la France de la fin de l‚Äôan VIII, appeared the same year.  Prussian reaction  Friedrich von Gentz by Thomas Lawrence He gained recognition abroad and gifts of money from the British and Austrian governments, but it made his position as an official in Berlin impossible, as the Prussian government had no mind to abandon its attitude of cautious neutrality. Private affairs also combined to urge Gentz to leave the Prussian service; mainly through his own fault, a separation with his wife was arranged. In May 1802, accordingly, he took leave of his wife and left with his friend Adam M√ºller for Vienna. In Berlin, he had been intimate with the Austrian ambassador, Count Stadion, whose good offices procured him an introduction to the Emperor Francis. The immediate result was the title of imperial councillor, with a yearly salary of 4000 gulden (6 December 1802), but it was not until 1809 that he was actively employed. Before returning to Berlin to make arrangements for transferring himself finally to Vienna, Gentz paid a visit to London, where he made the acquaintance of Pitt and Grenville, who were so impressed with his talents that in addition to large money presents, he was guaranteed an annual pension by the British government in recognition of the value of the services of his pen against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then on, he was engaged in a ceaseless polemic against every fresh advance of Napoleonic power and pretensions. With matchless sarcasm he lashed the nerveless policy of courts that suffered indignity with resignation. He denounced the recognition of Napoleon's imperial title and drew up a manifesto of Louis XVIII against it. The formation of the coalition and the outbreak of war, for a while, raised his hopes despite his lively distrust of the competence of Austrian ministers. Hopes were speedily dashed by the Battle of Austerlitz and its results. Gentz used his enforced leisure to write a brilliant essay on The relations between England and Spain before the outbreak of war between the two powers (Leipzig, 1806). Shortly afterwards appeared Fragmente aus der neuesten Geschichte des politischen Gleichgewichts in Europa (translated as Fragments on the Balance of Power in Europe, London, 1806). The last of Gentz's works as an independent publicist, it was a masterly expos√© of the actual political situation and was also prophetic in its suggestions as to how this should be retrieved: \\"Through Germany Europe has perished; through Germany it must rise again\\". He realized that the dominance of France could not be broken but by the union of Austria and Prussia, acting in concert with Britain. He watched with interest the Prussian military preparations. At the invitation of Count Haugwitz, he went at the outset of the campaign to the Prussian headquarters at Erfurt, where he drafted the king's proclamation and his letter to Napoleon. The writer was known, and it was in this connection that Napoleon referred to him as a \\"wretched scribe named Gentz, one of those men without honour who sell themselves for money\\". Gentz had no official mandate from the Austrian government, and whatever hopes he may have cherished of privately influencing the situation in the direction of an alliance between the two German powers were speedily dashed by the Battle of Jena. The downfall of Prussia left Austria the sole hope of Germany and of Europe. Gentz, who from the winter of 1806 onwards divided his time between Prague and the Bohemian watering places, seemed to devote himself wholly to the pleasures of society, his fascinating personality gaining him a ready reception in those exalted circles that were to prove of use to him later on in Vienna. However, though he published nothing, his pen was not idle, and he was occupied with a series of essays on the future of Austria and the best means of liberating Germany and redressing the balance of Europe, but he himself confessed to his friend M√ºller (4 August 1806) that in the miserable circumstances of the time, his essay on the principles of a general pacification must be taken as a political poem.  War between Austria and France  In 1809, on the outbreak of war between Austria and France, Gentz was for the first time actively employed by the Austrian government under Stadion. He drafted the proclamation announcing the declaration of war (15 April) and during the continuance of hostilities his pen was ceaselessly employed. The peace of 1810 and the fall of Stadion once more dashed his hopes and, disillusioned and hellishly blas√©, he once more retired to comparative inactivity at Prague. Of Metternich, Stadion's successor, he had at the outset no high opinion, and it was not until 1812 that the two men had close relations that were to ripen into lifelong friendship. However, when Gentz returned to Vienna as Metternich's adviser, he was no longer the fiery patriot who had sympathized and corresponded with Stein in the darkest days of German depression and, in fiery periods, called upon all Europe to free itself from foreign rule. Disillusioned and cynical but clear-sighted as ever, he was henceforth before all things an Austrian, more Austrian, on occasion even than Metternich. During the final stages of the campaign of 1814, he expressed the hope that Metternich would substitute Austria for Europe in his diplomacy and, despite his opposition to Napoleon and of France, secure an Austro-French alliance by maintaining the husband of Marie Louise on the throne of France. For ten years, from 1812 onward, Gentz was in close touch with all the great affairs of European history, the assistant, confidant and adviser of Metternich. He accompanied the chancellor on all his journeys and was present at all the conferences that preceded and followed the war. No political secrets were hidden from him, and his hand drafted all important diplomatic documents. He was secretary to the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815) and to all the congresses and conferences that followed until the Conference of Verona (1822); his vast knowledge of men and affairs made him a power. He was under no illusion as to their achievements, and his memoir on the work of the congress of Vienna is at once an incisive piece of criticism and a monument of his own disillusionment. However, the liberalism of his early years was gone forever, and he had become reconciled to Metternich's view that in an age of decay, the sole function of a statesman was to prop up mouldering institutions. It was the hand of the author of that offensive Memorandum to Frederick William III on the freedom of the press that drafted the Carlsbad Decrees. It was he who inspired the policy of repressing the freedom of the universities, and he noted in his diary as a day more important than that of Leipzig the session of the Vienna conference of 1819, which decided to make the convocation of representative assemblies in the German states impossible, by enforcing the letter of Article XIII of the Act of Confederation.  Private life  In private life, Gentz remained to the last a man of the world, but he was tormented with an exaggerated terror of death. He never saw his wife again since their parting at Berlin, and his relations with other women, mostly of the highest rank, were too numerous to record. However, passion tormented him to the end, and his infatuation for Fanny Elssler, the celebrated danseuse, forms the subject of some remarkable letters to his friend Rahel, the wife of Varnhagen von Ense (1830‚Äì1831). Death and legacy He died in Vienna in 1832. Gentz has been described as a mercenary of the pen, and no other such mercenary has ever carved out for himself a more remarkable career. To have done so would have been impossible, in spite of his brilliant gifts, had he been no more than the \\"wretched scribe\\" sneered at by Napoleon. Though by birth, he belonged to the middle class in a country of hide-bound aristocracy, he lived to move on equal terms in the society of princes and statesmen, which would never have been the case had he been notoriously bought and sold. Yet that he was in the habit of receiving gifts from all and sundry who hoped for his backing is beyond dispute. He notes that at the Congress of Vienna he received ¬£22,000 through Talleyrand from Louis XVIII, while Castlereagh gave him ¬£600, accompanied by \\"les plus folles promesses\\"; his diary is full of such entries. Yet he never made any secret of these gifts. Metternich was aware of them, and he never suspected Gentz of writing or acting in consequence against his convictions. As a matter of fact, no man was more free or outspoken in his criticism of the policy of his employers than this apparently venal writer. The gifts and pensions were rather in the nature of subsidies than bribes. They were the recognition by various powers of the value of an ally whose pen had proved itself so potent a weapon in their cause. It is, indeed, the very impartiality and objectivity of his attitude that make the writings of Gentz such illuminating documents for the period of history which they cover. Allowance must of course be made for his point of view but less so perhaps than in the case of any other writer so intimately concerned with the policies which he criticizes. Apart from their value as historical documents, Gentz's writings are literary monuments, classic examples of nervous and luminous German prose and of French as a model for diplomatic style.

Early life Chiumiento was born in Switzerland but spent most of his childhood abroad. His father, Gerardo Chiumiento, was a power tool salesman and plied his trade in Canada, Saudi Arabia and Japan before returning to his home country with his son. Career =Juventus= Chiumiento began his career in 2004 at Juventus and quickly made an impressive name for himself at the club on his debut coming on as a substitute against Ancona at the age of 19. Chiumiento also played alongside his childhood hero Alessandro Del Piero, stating after the match \\"This was my dream\\". In 2004, he was loaned out to Serie B club Siena to gain more experience. Chiumiento broke into the first-team with 14 apps and contributed to the second division side's promotion. The following year he was loaned out to French side Le Mans playing 27 Ligue 1 matches scoring one goal. In 2006, he was loaned out to Swiss club BSC Young Boys. After his performances in the Swiss Super League, FC Lucerne showed interest in the player and signed him the following year. =Luzern= Chiumiento signed a three-year contract with FC Luzern in the summer of 2007, for ‚Ç¨150,000 transfer fee. Chiumiento scored his first goal for Luzern against FC Basel. Chiumiento scored his first hat-trick against FC Aarau; the match ended 6‚Äì0. =Vancouver Whitecaps= Chiumiento signed with Vancouver Whitecaps of the USSF Division 2 Professional League in 2010. He made his USSFD2 debut for Vancouver on 24 September 2010 in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Montreal Impact. He signed an MLS contract with the club on 8 March 2011. Chiumiento made his Major League Soccer debut for the Whitecaps on 19 March 2011 against Toronto FC, assisting on two goals in a 4‚Äì2 win. He scored only two goals in his time with the Whitecaps, a botched cross against the San Jose Earthquakes on 11 May. His second goal was a cutback by Camilo where he chipped the ball up, spun 360 degrees, and went bar down with his right foot. It was a candidate for MLS Goal of the Year. =FC Z√ºrich= On 11 July 2012, Chiumiento was transferred to FC Z√ºrich for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal on 19 August, putting it bottom right, making it 1‚Äì1 against Servette FC. He won the 2013‚Äì14 Swiss Cup and 2015‚Äì16 Swiss Cup with Z√ºrich. In June 2017 his contract was not renewed. =International= Chiumiento was called up as a replacement for Johann Lonfat in Switzerland's UEFA Euro 2004 squad. However, he turned the call-up down as he still had hope of appearing for Italy. In February 2010, Chiumiento decided to play for Switzerland and made his first appearance for the Swiss national neam in a friendly match against Uruguay after having declined many call-ups. Although his dream was to play for Italy he decided he would play for Switzerland as he has a chance to be a regular in the starting team. Chiumiento was not chosen for the Swiss 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Playing style Chiumiento is referred to as the Swiss Ronaldinho although he idolizes Alessandro Del Piero. He is recognized for his pace, dribbling skills, and playmaking ability. Chiumiento plays preferably as a central attacking midfielder, but can play on both wings, or as a second striker. Personal life Davide attended Heiden Primary School in his hometown before moving to Turin, Italy, to attend Scuola Privata Athenaeum. He has a mother, Manuela Chiumiento, and an older brother, Claudio Chiumiento. Davide is fluent in four languages, English, French, Italian, and German. These have all helped him have a successful career in many countries. Davide had a great friendship with former FC Zurich striker, Eric Hassli, in his time in Vancouver, not just off the field, but on it, as many Hassli's goals were set up or created by Chiumiento. Davide was Hassli's best man at his wedding right before he transferred to FC Zurich. Some of his hobbies include spending time with his family and friends, and listening to Latin or Brazilian music, as well as surfing the internet. He is a dual citizen as his father was born in Italy.

Irabattesi Giovanni Battista Doni (bap. 13 March 1595 ‚Äì 1647) was an Italian musicologist and humanist who made an extensive study of ancient music. He is known, among other works, for having renamed the note \\"Ut\\" to \\"Do\\" (in the \\"Do Re Mi ...\\" solf√®ge scale). In his day, he was a well-known lawyer, classical scholar, critic and musical theorist, and from 1640 to 1647 he occupied the Chair of Eloquence at the University of Florence and was a prominent member of the city's Accademia della Crusca, one of the early semi-scientific/academic societies that flourished in Italy at the time. They had published the first Italian-language dictionary in 1612.  Life  Born in Florence, he studied Greek, rhetoric, poetry and philosophy at the Universities of Florence and Bologna and both mathematics and jurisprudence at the University of Rome. Later he studied jurisprudence at Bourges in France and it is claimed that he worked for some time with the famous legal scholar Jacques Cujas who was a prominent member of the legal humanists or mos gallicus school (a French approach to historical law studies). However, since Cujas died a few years before Giovanni Doni's birth, this seems to be unlikely; however he probably did study under the legal humanists as the University of Bourges. (See also Cujas Library) This approach to legal studies was admired during the early French revolutionary period because it emphasised the importance of early Roman law, rather than the pretensions of French kings.Ogilvie, Brian W. The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe =Corsini family= Doni received the degree of doctor from the University of Pisa and was chosen to accompany Neri Corsini (1614-1678) to Paris in 1621 where he became acquainted with Marin Mersenne and other literary persons. The Florentine Corsini family became important contacts in Doni's life: Neri Corsini became a cardinal in 1664 (Don't confuse with Neri Maria Corsini who became Cardinal in 1730, the year that Lorenzo Corsini became Pope Clement XII.) This was a period where the top religious orders were part of a culture of nepotism, and Doni attached himself to these religious dynasties. =Barberini family= On returning to Florence in 1622, Doni entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, and moved with him to Rome where Barberini became Dean of the College of Cardinals. Barberini was the elder brother of Cardinal Antonio Barberini, and the nephew of Maffeo Barberini who became Pope Urban VIII. He had studied at the University of Pisa where he was assisted by the family friend Galileo Galilei. Later in 1633 Barberini served with the Inquisition tribunal investigating Galileo, but was one of three members of the tribunal who refused to condemn Galileo. Doni later accompanied the cardinal who was a special legate sent to Cardinal Richelieu to Paris, and then in 1625 to Madrid (papal legate), and back to Rome (1626). Doni made good use of the opportunities that arose from these journeys to acquire substantial knowledge of ancient music. Among other things, he either invented or reconstructed, a double lyre which, in honour of his patron, he called a Lyra Barberina or Amphichord (see barbiton). =Opera in Florence= Giovanni returned to Florence once again (around 1640), where he married and settled down as professor at the university where he continued his studies of ancient music and music theory. Opera had been invented in Florence, and Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo, was a key member of the group which established the new approach to theatre, and also an experimenter with acoustic laws and harmonies. Under guidance from Doni, Cardinal Barberini, was encouraged to venture into the production of an ancient version of opera. He died only seven years after returning for Florence. Doni's main contribution to the world of letters was the study of classic musical theory as it existed in antiquity. Between 1635 and 1639 he wrote a Treatise on Music for the Theatre (Trattato della musica scenica) which provides important history details for early opera.MacClinock, Carol Readings in the History of Music in Performance (1979)  Do Re Mi (Solf√®ge)  In the eleventh century, the music theorist Guido of Arezzo developed a six-note ascending scale that went as follows: ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, and named the Aretinian syllables after him. The names were taken from the first verse of the Latin hymn Ut queant laxis, where the syllables fall on their corresponding scale degree. Giovanni Doni is known for having changed the name of note \\"Ut\\" (C), renaming it \\"Do\\" (in the \\"Do Re Mi ...\\" sequence known as solf√®ge). He convinced his contemporaries to make the change by arguing that 1) \\"Do\\" is easier to pronounce than \\"Ut,\\" and 2) \\"Do\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Dominus,\\" the Latin word for The Lord, who is the tonic and root of the world. There is much academic speculation that Giovanni Doni also wanted to imprint himself into musical canon in perpetuity because \\"Do\\" is also ulteriorly an abbreviation for his family name. A seventh note, \\"Si\\" (from the initials for \\"Sancte Iohannes\\", Latin vocative for ‚ÄúSt. John the Baptist‚Äù) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale.Davies, Norman (1997), Europe, pp.271-2 In Anglophone countries, \\"Si\\" was changed to \\"Ti\\" by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter.This also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp \\"Ti\\" is used in tonic sol-fa and in the song \\"Do-Re-Mi\\".

Water-meadows were mainly used in Europe from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. Working water-meadows have now largely disappeared, but the field patterns and water channels of derelict water-meadows remain common in areas where they were used, such as parts of Northern Italy, Switzerland and England. Derelict water-meadows are often of importance as wetland wildlife habitats. Water-meadows should not be confused with flood-meadows, which are naturally covered in shallow water by seasonal flooding from a river. \\"Water-meadow\\" is sometimes used more loosely to mean any level grassland beside a river. Types Two main types of water-meadow were used. =Catchwork water-meadow= These were used for fields on slopes, and relatively little engineering skill was required to construct them. Water from a stream or spring was fed to the top of a sloping field, and gentle sloping terraces were formed along which the water could trickle in a zig-zag fashion down the field. The water could be used again for fields lower down the slope. =Bedwork water-meadow= bedwork water-meadow at Fordingbridge, Hampshire, England. Winter flooding has filled an old carrier channel along the crest of a ridge (running from right foreground to middle distance), and has also flooded the drainage channels (on left and into distance, where they join the river). In use, water would have seeped from the carrier channel on the right, through the grass in the foreground into the drainage channel on the left, which would have been almost empty. Bedwork or floated water-meadows were built on almost-level fields along broad river valleys, and required careful construction to ensure correct operation. A leat, called a main, carrier or top carrier, was used to divert water from the river and carry it down the valley at a gentler slope than the river, producing a hydrostatic head between the two. Mains were often along the edge of the valley, each main supplying up to about of the valley. The water from the main was used to supply many smaller carriers, on the crests of ridges built across the fields. The channel on the crest of each ridge would overflow slowly down the sides (the panes) of the ridge, the channel eventually tapering to an end at the tip of the ridge. The seeping water would then be collected between the ridges, in drains or drawns, these joining to form a bottom carrier or tail drain which returned the water to the river. The ridges and the drains made an interlocking grid (like interlaced fingers), but the ridge-top channels and the drains did not connect directly. A by-carrier took any water not needed for irrigation straight from the main back to the river. The ridges varied in height depending on the available head - usually from around . The pattern of carriers and drains was generally regular, but it was adapted to fit the natural topography of the ground and the locations of suitable places for the offtake and return of water. The water flow was controlled by a system of hatches (sluice gates) and stops (small earth or wooden-board dams). Irrigation could be provided separately for each section of water-meadow. Sometimes aqueducts took carriers over drains, and causeways and culverts provided access for wagons. The working or floating (irrigation) and maintenance of the water-meadow was done by a highly skilled craftsman called a drowner or waterman, who was often employed by several adjacent farmers. The terminology used for watermeadows varied considerably with locality and dialect. Uses Water-meadow irrigation did not aim to flood the ground, but to keep it continuously damp - a working water-meadow has no standing water. Irrigation in early spring kept frosts off the ground and so allowed grass to grow several weeks earlier than otherwise, and in dry summer weather irrigation kept the grass growing. It also allowed the ground to absorb any plant nutrients or silt carried by the river water - this fertilised the grassland, and incidentally also reduced eutrophication of the river water by nutrient pollution. The grass was used both for making hay and for grazing by livestock (usually cattle or sheep). Derelict water-meadows Former water- meadows are found along many river valleys, where the sluice gates, channels and field ridges may still be visible (however the ridges should not be confused with ridge and furrow topography, which is found on drier ground and has a very different origin in arable farming). The drains in a derelict water-meadow are generally clogged and wet, and most of the carrier channels are dry, with the smaller ones on the ridge-tops often invisible. If any main carrier channels still flow, they usually connect permanently to the by- carriers. The larger sluices may be concealed under the roots of trees (such as crack willows), which have grown up from seedlings established in the brickwork. The complex mixture of wet and drier ground often gives derelict water-meadows particularly high wetland biodiversity. Working water- meadows Derelict water-meadows can be transformed into wildlife protection and conservation areas by repairing the irrigation, as is the case of Josefov Meadows in the Czech Republic. By imitating the natural river flooding which is rare in modern straightened and dammed rivers, a rich biodiversity can be restored and attract and sustain many rare and protected wetland species.

Composed between 1903 and 1905, the piece was premiered in Paris in October 1905. It was initially not well received; even some who had been strong supporters of Debussy's work were unenthusiastic. But the work was performed in the US in 1907 and Britain in 1908; after its second performance in Paris, in 1908, it quickly became one of Debussy's most admired and frequently performed orchestral works. The first audio recording of the work was made in 1928. Since then, orchestras and conductors from around the world have set it down in many studio or live concert recordings. Background and composition Debussy photographed by Otto Wegener, probably a few years after the composition of La mer La mer was the second of Debussy's three orchestral works in three sections. The first, the Nocturnes, was premiered in Paris in 1901, and though it had not made any great impact with the public it was well reviewed by musicians including Paul Dukas, Alfred Bruneau and Pierre de Br√©ville.Jensen, p. 71 Debussy conceived the idea of a more complex tripartite orchestral piece, and began work in August 1903.Jensen, p. 56 He was usually a slow worker, and although the composition of La mer took him more than a year and a half, this was unusually quick progress by his standards, particularly at a time of upheaval in his personal life. He began composing the work while visiting his parents-in-law in Burgundy; by the time it was complete, he had left his wife and was living with Emma Bardac, who was pregnant with Debussy's child. Debussy retained fond childhood memories of the beauties of the sea, but when composing La mer he rarely visited it, spending most of his time far away from large bodies of water. He drew inspiration from art, \\"preferring the seascapes available in painting and literature\\" to the physical sea.Huscher, Phillip. \\"La mer\\" , Chicago Symphony Orchestra, retrieved 15 May 2018 Although the detailed scheme of the work changed during its composition, Debussy decided from the outset that it was to be \\"three symphonic sketches\\" with the title La mer. In a letter to Andr√© Messager, he described the planned sections as \\"M√®re belle aux √éles Sanguinaires\\", \\"Jeu de vagues\\", and \\"Le vent fait danser la mer\\".Simeone, p. 108 The first of these, inspired by a short story of the same name by Camille Mauclair,Cogman, Peter. \\"Claude Debussy, Pierre Lou√øs and the √éles Sanguinaires\\", French Studies Bulletin, 1 December 2005, pp. 7‚Äì9 was abandoned in favour of a less restrictive theme, the sea from dawn to midday. The last was also dropped, as too reminiscent of ballet, and the less specific theme of the dialogue between the wind and the sea took its place.Jensen, p. 197 Debussy completed La mer in March 1905 at the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne on the English Channel coast, which he described to his publisher, Durand, as \\"a charming peaceful spot: the sea unfurls itself with an utterly British correctness.\\"Quoted in Simeone, p. 108 He arranged the piece for piano four hands in 1905, and in 1909 Durand published a second edition of La mer with the composer's revisions.Trezise, Simon. \\"La mer by Claude Debussy: Edition Marie Rolf\\", Notes, March 2000, pp. 782‚Äì783 Analysis La mer is scored for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam tam, glockenspiel, 2 harps and strings.

[and by calling it] 'Three symphonic sketches' ... [Debussy] must have felt that he had deftly avoided association with either genre.\\" Yet the work has sometimes been called a symphony, even on occasion, by Debussy himself.Trezise, p. 101 It consists of two powerful outer movements framing a lighter, faster piece which acts as a type of scherzo. But the analyst Jean Barraqu√© describes La mer as the first work to have an \\"open\\" form ‚Äì a devenir sonore or \\"sonorous becoming... a developmental process in which the very notions of exposition and development coexist in an uninterrupted burst.\\" Simon Trezise, in his 1994 book Debussy: La Mer comments, \\"motifs are constantly propagated by derivation from earlier motifs\\"Barraqu√©, p. 52 Trezise writes that \\"for much of La Mer, Debussy spurns the more obvious devices associated with the sea, wind, and concomitant storm in favour of his own, highly individual vocabulary\\".Trezise, pp. 48‚Äì49 Caroline Potter, in The Cambridge Companion to Debussy, comments that Debussy's depiction of the sea \\"avoids monotony by using a multitude of water figurations that could be classified as musical onomatopoeia: they evoke the sensation of swaying movement of waves and suggest the pitter-patter of falling droplets of spray\\" (and so forth), and ‚Äì significantly ‚Äì avoid the arpeggiated triads used by Schubert and Wagner to evoke the movement of water.Potter, p. 149 In The Cambridge Companion to Debussy, Mark DeVoto describes La mer as \\"much more complex than anything Debussy had written earlier\\", particularly the Nocturnes: The author, musicologist and pianist Roy Howat has observed, in his book Debussy in Proportion, that the formal boundaries of La mer correspond exactly to the mathematical ratios called the Golden Section.Howat, pp. 1‚Äì7 Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence \\"remarkable,\\" but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.Trezise, p. 53 Reception The premiere was given on 15 October 1905 in Paris, by the Orchestre Lamoureux under the direction of Camille Chevillard.Lesure, Fran√ßois, and Roy Howat.\\"Claude Debussy\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001, retrieved 14 May 2018 .

Chevillard was a respected interpreter of the classics, but was not at home with new music.Trezise, p. 20 It was not until 1908, at the second performance of the work in Paris, conducted by the composer, that La mer became a success with the public. Trezise records that at the time, many felt the 1908 concert presented the real first performance of the piece.Trezise, p. 22 Although some of Debussy's contemporaries drew analogies between La mer and French Impressionist paintings ‚Äì much to the composer's irritation ‚Äì others have detected the influence of his admiration for the English painter J.

He was the last British person to be governor of either state. Military career After studies at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Bastyan was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the British Army's Sherwood Foresters on 30 August 1923, and promoted to lieutenant on 30 August 1925. He was promoted to captain in the West Yorkshire Regiment on 4 April 1935 and attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1936‚Äì1937, transferring to the Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1937, and seeing service in Palestine from 1938‚Äì1939. Bastyan was promoted to major on 30 August 1940. From November 1939 to June 1941, during the Second World War, Bastyan served as a GSO II in Palestine with the Royal Irish Fusiliers and was mentioned in despatches in March 1941. He served as assistant quarter-master general in the Middle East from July 1941 to May 1942, subsequently as deputy director of the Higher Commander's Course from May to October of that year. Bastyan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in September 1942, by which time he was a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to temporary brigadier the following month and confirmed as a war substantive lieutenant colonel in November 1942. Bastyan served as a temporary brigadier (quartermaster) from then until January 1944, when he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in August 1944. In December 1944, Bastyan was appointed an acting major general (Administration, Allied Land Forces, South East Asia). He was promoted to colonel in July 1945, and confirmed as temporary major general in October 1946. He was promoted to substantive major-general on 26 January 1948, with seniority from 13 April 1946. After the war, Bastyan became Chief of Staff at British Army of the Rhine in October 1946 (which involved looking after the logistics for the Berlin airlift between 1946 and 1948). He went on to be Chief of Staff at Eastern Command in July 1949, Director of Staff Duties at the War Office in November 1950 and General Officer Commanding 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division in October 1952. After that he became Deputy Adjutant-General at the War Office in March 1955 and then Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong in June 1957. He retired from the British Army in June 1960 and was appointed Governor of South Australia on 4 April 1961. Vice- Regal career On two occasions during his period as governor in South Australia, the elections did not result in a clear majority. In both 1962 and 1968, rather than make a precipitate decision to select the premier from the party with the largest minority (and more than 50% of the votes), he bided time and waited for parliament to meet. In both cases, the quick decision would have turned out to be wrong, and the South Australian House of Assembly selected the premier from the other party. In 1962, this allowed the Liberal and Country League Playford government to continue rather than the Labor Party led by Frank Walsh. In 1968, the Labor government of Don Dunstan lost to the Liberal and Country League led by Steele Hall. Bastyan's term in office in Tasmania was relatively uneventful, though he did have to deal, after the 1969 State election, with a deadlocked House of Assembly where both the ALP and Liberals had the same number of seats. The matter was resolved by Kevin Lyons, the lone representative of the tiny Centre Party entering into a coalition with the Liberals.

Overview The meadow is an ancient area of grazing land, still used for horses and cattle, and according to legend has never been ploughed, at least for around 4,000 years. It is said that in return for helping to defend the kingdom against the marauding Danes, the Freemen of Oxford were given the of pasture next to the River Thames by Alfred the Great who, legend has it, founded the city in the 10th century (although Alfred actually died in the 9th century). The Freemen's collective right to graze their animals free of charge is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and has been exercised ever since. Swimmers at Port Meadow, bathing at the confluence of the River Thames and the Castle Mill Stream. The meadow runs from Jericho to Wolvercote (where north of the Shiplake Ditch it becomes Wolvercote Common) along the east (left) bank of the River Thames, with the Cotswold Line railway, the Oxford Canal and the suburb of North Oxford further to the east, and the village of Binsey to the west. Access to Port Meadow is via Walton Well Road or Aristotle Lane in the south (or from the south via Roger Dudman Way or the Thames Path) or from Godstow Road, Wolvercote via Wolvercote Common in the north. It is a typical English flood-meadow and is a favourite area for walking, with easy access from the city of Oxford. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest. At the southern end of the meadow is Fiddler's Island in the River Thames. In the winter the meadow sometimes floods; if frozen it forms a huge and relatively safe area for skating. In late spring vast areas are carpeted with buttercups. Horses, cattle and geese graze the meadow and many birds can often be seen. At the eastern edge of Port Meadow, just north of the entrance from Aristotle Lane, is Burgess Field, a reclaimed landfill site and home to a nature reserve, managed by Oxford City Council. It covers an area of about ; a circular path around the edge passes through some small copses. Port Meadow is one of the most popular locations in Oxford for recreation activities such as walking, running, cycling and swimming in the adjacent River Thames. During days of fair weather the banks of the River Thames in the Meadow are often lined with people enjoying the natural environs. The meadow is also popular with photographers and bird- watchers. History Horses in the mist on Port Meadow The River Thames (known as the Isis in this area) flows past this large grazing meadow. This is where the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river on 4 July 1862 with three young girls ‚Äî Lorina, Alice, and Edith Liddell. While journeying slowly from Folly Bridge to near Godstow, Dodgson began at their request to make up a story that later was expanded into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Because the meadow appears never to have been ploughed, it contains well-preserved archaeological remains, some of which survive as residual earthworks. Of particular note are several Bronze Age round barrows, an area of Iron Age settlement, and the foundations of 17th-century fortifications from the Parliamentary siege of Oxford during the English Civil War. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the meadow was used for horse racing, and low stone bridges laid over washes and ditches for this purpose still survive.Historic Port Meadow to get revamp, The Oxford Times, 8 July 1998. During the First World War part of Port Meadow was used to train the Royal Flying Corps and turned into a military aerodrome. Fifteen air crew and pilots were killed flying from Port Meadow or close by. In 1940, during the Second World War, a camp was set up on the meadow for military personnel evacuated from Dunkirk. In the 1980s and 1990s, the meadow was known as a location for free festivals and raves.Oxford Free Festival 1986, UK Rock Festivals, July 2012.UK Police Halt Rave Party, Party Vibe, 11 August 1998.May Morning Tips, Road & Travel Magazine. Just across the Thames is Bossoms Boatyard, with a small marina and Medley Footbridge across the Thames. The Medley Sailing Club, the furthest upstream sailing club on the River Thames, is on the western bank. To the south is the start of the Castle Mill Stream and Cripley Meadow, largely consisting of allotments. Development Panoramic view looking south from Port Meadow of new Oxford University Castle Mill graduate housing St Barnabas Church campanile obscured by new Oxford University Castle Mill graduate accommodation buildings, at the southern end of Port Meadow From 2012, the Oxford University Estates Directorate, with the help of Longcross, have been developing the one-hectare Castle Mill site (400 m √ó 25 m) between the Cripley Meadow Allotments and the railway tracks, close to the southern end of Port Meadow, as extensive student accommodation. The development was controversial, since the four to five storey blocks overlook Port Meadow. Campaigners warned of damage to views of Oxford. There has been an online petition and a \\"Save Port Meadow\\" campaign was established in December 2012. Concerns were raised by the Oxford Preservation Trust and the Green Party. Anger was caused even among members of Oxford University. The development was likened to building a \\"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\\". In February 2013, Oxford City Council entered negotiations with Oxford University to reduce the height of the buildings by two storeys. On 7 May 2013, the Campaign to Protect Rural England applied to the High Court for judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission on the grounds that requirements for a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were not met. In 2016, Oxford University proposed an array of mitigating techniques, including cladding and horizontal beams to \\"break up the vertical fa√ßade\\". Later, changes were made to the buildings in an attempt to reduce their visual impact.

The Cerrados of Brazil : Ecology and Natural History of a Neotropical Savanna. Columbia University Press, 2002. eBook. Since then vast amounts of research have proved that the Cerrado is one of the richest of all tropical savanna regions and has high levels of endemism. Characterizing it by be its enormous ranges of plant and animal biodiversity, World Wide Fund for Nature named the Cerrado the biologically richest savanna in the world, with about 10,000 plant species and 10 endemic bird species. There are nearly 200 species of mammal in the Cerrado, though only 14 are endemic. Climate The Cerrado's climate is typical of the wetter savanna regions of the world, with a semi-humid tropical climate. The Cerrado is limited to two dominant seasons throughout the year, wet and dry. Annual temperatures for the Cerrado average between 22 and 27 ¬∞C and average precipitation between 800‚Äì2000 mm for over 90% of the area.RATTER, J.A.; RIBEIRO, J.F. & BRIDGEWATER, S. (1997) The Brazilian Cerrado vegetation and Threats to its Biodiversity. Annals of Botany, 80: pp. 223‚Äì230 This ecoregion has a very strong dry season during the southern winter (approx. April‚ÄìSeptember). Flora Cerrado vegetation of Brazil. The Cerrado is characterized by unique vegetation types. It is composed of a shifting mosaic of habitats, with the savanna-like cerrado itself on well-drained areas between strips of gallery forest (closed canopy tall forest) which occur along streams.VIERRA, E.M. & MARINHO-FILHO, J. (1998). Pre- and Post-Fire Habitat Utilization by Rodents of Cerrado from Central Brazil. Biotropica, 30: pp. 491‚Äì496 Between the cerrado and the gallery forest is an area of vegetation known as the wet campo with distinct up- and downslope borders where tree growth is inhibited due to wide seasonal fluctuations in the water table. The savanna portion of the Cerrado is heterogeneous in terms of canopy cover. Goodland (1971) divided the Cerrado into four categories ranging from least to most canopy cover: campo sujo (herbaceous layer with occasional small trees about 3 m tall), campo cerrado (slightly higher density of trees about 4 m tall on average), cerrado sensu stricto (orchard-like vegetation with trees about 6 m high) and cerradao (canopy cover near 50% with general height 9 m).GOODLAND, R. 1971. A physiognomic analysis of the 'cerrado' vegetation of central Brazil. Journal of Ecology, 59: 411- 419 Probably around 800 species of trees are found in the Cerrado. Among the most diverse families of trees in the Cerrado are the Leguminosae (153), Malpighiaceae (46), Myrtaceae (43), Melastomataceae (32) and Rubiaceae (30).HERRINGER, E.P.; BARROSO, G.M.; RIZZO J.A. & RIZZINI C.T. 1977. A Flora do Cerrado. In FERRI M.G. ed. IV SimpoUsio sobre o cerrado. S√£o Paulo, Brazil. 211‚Äì232 Much of the Cerrado is dominated by the Vochysiaceae (23 species in the Cerrado) due to the abundance of three species in the genus Qualea. The herbaceous layer usually reaches about 60 cm in height and is composed mainly of the Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Much of the vegetation in the gallery forests is similar to nearby rainforest; however, there are some endemic species found only in the Cerrado gallery forests. Soil fertility, fire regime and hydrology are thought to be most influential in determining Cerrado vegetation. Cerrado soils are always well-drained and most are oxisols with low pH and low calcium and magnesium.FURLEY P.A. & RATTER, J.A. 1988. Soil resources and plant communities of the Central Brazilian cerrado and their development. Journal of Biogeography 15: 97‚Äì108 The amount of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus has been found to be positively correlated with tree trunk basal area in Cerrado habitats.GOODLAND, R & POLLARD, R. 1973. The Brazilian Cerrado Vegetation: A Fertility Gradient. Journal of Ecology 61: 219‚Äì224 Much as in other grasslands and savannas, fire is important in maintaining and shaping the Cerrado's landscape; many plants in the Cerrado are fire-adapted, exhibiting characters like thick corky bark to withstand the heat. Cerrado vegetation is believed to be ancient, stretching back perhaps as far in a prototypic form as the Cretaceous, before Africa and South America separated.RATTER, J.A. & RIBEIRO, J.F. 1996.

Planaltina, DF, Brazil. EMBRAPA/CPAC: 3‚Äì6 A dynamic expansion and contraction between cerrado and Amazonian rainforest has probably occurred historically, with expansion of the Cerrado during glacial periods like the Pleistocene.MAYLE, F.E.; BURBRIDGE, R. & KILLEEN T.J. 2000. Millennial-Scale Dynamics of Southern Amazonian Rain Forests. Science 290: 2291‚Äì2294 These processes and the resulting fragmentation in multiple refugia have probably contributed to the high species richness both of the Cerrado and of the Amazonian rainforest. Fauna The insects of the Cerrado are relatively understudied.PINHEIRO, F.; DINIZ, I.R.; COELHO, D. & BANDEIRA, M.P.S. 2002. Seasonal pattern of insect abundance in the Brazilian cerrado. Austral Ecology 27: 132‚Äì136 A yearlong survey of the Cerrado at one reserve in Brazil found that the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Isoptera accounted for 89.5% of all captures. The Cerrado also supports a high density (up to 4000 per hectare) of the nests of leaf cutter ants (sa√∫vas), which are also very diverse.LEAL, I.R. & OLIVEIRA, P.S. 2000. Foraging ecology of attine ants in a Neotropical savanna: seasonal use of fungal substrate in the cerrado vegetation of Brazil. Insectes Sociaux 47: 376‚Äì382 Along with termites, leaf cutter ants are the primary herbivores of the Cerrado and play an important role in consuming and decomposing organic matter, as well as constituting an important food source to many other animal species.OLIVEIRA, P.S. & FREITAS, A.V.L. 2004. Ant-plant-herbivore interactions in the neotropical cerrado savanna.

Information about Cerrado amphibians is extremely limited, although the Cerrado probably has a unique assemblage of species with some endemic to the region.BRASILEIRO, C.A.; SAWAYA, R.J.; KIEFER, M.C. & MARTINS, M. 2005. Amphibians of an open cerrado fragment in southeastern Brazil. Biota Neotropica 5 The frog species Physalaemus nattereri (posterior view shown) is found in the open cerrado, but not in adjacent gallery forests. Most birds found in the Cerrado breed there although there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through.DA SILVA, J.S.C. 1997. Endemic birds species and conservation in the Cerrado region, South America. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 435‚Äì450 Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats. Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest.DA SILVA, J.S.C. 1996. Distribution of Amazonian and Atlantic birds in gallery forests of the cerrado region, South America. Ornitologia Neotropical 7: 1‚Äì18 The crowned solitary eagle, hyacinth macaw, toco toucan, buff-necked ibis, dwarf tinamou, and Brazilian merganser are examples of birds found in the Cerrado. Gallery forests serve as primary habitat for most of the mammals in the Cerrado, having more water, being protected from fires that sweep the landscape and having a more highly structured habitat.REDFORD, K.H. 1986. The role of gallery forests in the zoogeography of the Cerrado's non-volant mammalian fauna. Biotropica 18: 126‚Äì135 Eleven mammal species are endemic to the Cerrado. Notable species include large herbivores like the Brazilian tapir and Pampas deer and large predators like the maned wolf, cougar, jaguar, giant otter, ocelot and jaguarundi. Although the diversity is much lower than in the adjacent Amazon and Atlantic Forest, several species of monkeys are present, including black- striped capuchin, black howler monkey and black-tufted marmoset.HENRIQUES, R.P.B. & CAVALCANTE, R.J. 2004. Survey of a gallery forest orimate community in the cerrado of the Distrito Federal, central Brazil. 12: 78‚Äì83 History and human population Taking advantage of the sprouting of the herbaceous stratum that follows a burning in the Cerrado, the aboriginal inhabitants of these regions learned to use the fire as a tool, to increase the fodder to offer to their domesticated animals. Xavantes, , Karaj√°s, Av√°-Canoeiros, Krah√¥s, Xerentes, Xacriab√°s were some of the first indigenous peoples occupying different regions in the Cerrado. Many groups among the indigenous were nomads and explored the Cerrado by hunting and collecting. Others practiced coivara agriculture, an itinerant type of slash-and-burn agriculture. The mixing of indigenous, quilombola maroon communities, extractivists, geraizeiros (living in the drier regions), riverbank dwellers and vazanteiros (living on floodplains) shaped a diverse local population that relies heavily on the resources of their environment. Until the mid-1960s, agricultural activities in the Cerrado were very limited, directed mainly at the extensive production of beef cattle for subsistence of the local market, since cerrado soils are naturally infertile for agricultural production. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to Bras√≠lia has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region. From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental programs have been launched with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region, through subsidies for agriculture. As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production. On the other hand, the urban pressure and the rapid establishment of agricultural activities in the region have been rapidly reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystems, and the population in the Cerrado region more than doubled from 1970 to 2010, going from 35.8 million to 76 million.Development for Sustainable Agriculture: The Brazilian Cerrado https://books.google.ca/books?id=HVzeCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA100&lpg;=PA100&dq;=cerrado+population&source;=bl&ots;=sIxHN3fc3U&sig;=uji_f4hIzqhUQERvaC9Ccu_X5iA&hl;=en&sa;=X&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=cerrado%20population&f;=false Agriculture The Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, Embrapa, discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tons of lime per hectare. This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area. Researchers also developed tropical varieties of soybeans, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main soyabeans exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.The Economist. Brazilian agriculture: The miracle of the cerrado. August 26, 2010. http://www.economist.com/node/16886442Observatory of Economic Complexity http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/hs92/1201/ Today the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize and rice. Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of Eucalyptus and Pinus, but as a secondary activity. Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.Lopes, A. Scheid. \\"Soils under Cerrado: A Success Story in Soil Management.\\" Better Crops International. 10.2 (1996): n. page. Print. Charcoal production Charcoal production for Brazil's steel industry comes in second to agriculture in the Cerrado. They actually are quite intertwined. When land is being cleared to make more land for agriculture, the tree's trunks and roots are often used in the production of charcoal, helping to make money for the clearing. The Brazilian steel industry has traditionally always used the trunks and roots from the Cerrado for charcoal but now that the steel mills in the state of Minas Gerais are the world's largest, it has taken a much higher toll on the Cerrado. However, recently because of the conservation efforts and the diminishing vegetation in the Cerrado, they now are receiving some charcoal from the eucalyptus plantations and these efforts are growing. Rivers The Cerrado biome is strategic for the water resources of Brazil. The biome contains the headwaters and the largest portion of South American watersheds (the Paran√°-Paraguay, Araguaia-Tocantins, and S√£o Francisco river basins) and the upper catchments of large Amazon tributaries, such as the Xingu and Tapaj√≥s. During the last four decades, the Cerrado‚Äôs rivers basins have been highly impacted by extreme deforestation, expansion of the agricultural and cattle ranching frontier, construction of dams, and extraction of water for irrigation. Conservation The Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and the most biodiverse savanna in the world. However, it is not currently recognized by the Brazilian Constitution as a National Heritage. It is also home to the Guarani Aquifer, stores the largest fresh water underground reservoirs in South America, and supplies water to a third of the Amazon river and the largest basins in the continent.The Cerrado: Brazil's Other Biodiverse Region Loses Ground http://e360.yale.edu/features/the_cerrado_brazils_other_biodiversity_hotspot_loses_groundDW ‚Äì Secrets of the Brazilian Cerrado http://www.dw.com/en/secrets-of-the- brazilian-cerrado/a-37066253 Brazilian agriculturalists and ministers regard it as it has no conservation value, and the government has protected merely 1.5% of the Cerrado biome in Federal Reserves. By 1994, an estimated 695,000 km2 of cerrado (representing 35% of its area) had been converted to 'anthropic landscape'. In total, 37.3% of the Cerrado has already been totally converted to human use, while an additional 41.4% is used for pasture and charcoal production. The gallery forests in the region have been among the most heavily affected. It is estimated that only about 432,814 km2, or 21.3% of the original vegetation, remains intact today.Conservation International. http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/cerrado/pages/impacts.aspx Access date: 31/08/2011 During the last 25 years this biome has been increasingly threatened by industrial single-crop monoculture farming, particularly soybeans, the unregulated expansion of industrial agriculture, the burning of vegetation for charcoal and the development of dams to provide irrigation are drawing criticisms and have been identified as potential threats to several Brazilian rivers.A Disappearing Biome?

Vol. 171, No. 2 (Jun., 2005), pp. 99‚Äì111 This industrial farming of the Cerrado, with the clearing of land for eucalyptus and soya plantations, has grown so much because of various forms of subsidy, including very generous tax incentives and low interest loans, this has caused an enormous establishment of highly mechanized, capital intensive system of agriculture.Carlos Klink and Ricardo Machado (2005). \\"Conservation of the Brazilian Cerrado\\". Conservation Biology, Volume 19 #3. There is also a strong agribusiness lobby in Brazil and in particular, the production of soybeans in the Cerrado is influenced by large corporations such as ADM, Cargill and Bunge, these latter two directly associated with the mass deforestation of this biome.Mighty Earth ‚Äì Mystery Meat http://www.mightyearth.org/mysterymeat/The New York Times: Amazon Deforestation, Once Tamed, Comes Roaring Back https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/business/energy-environment/deforestation- brazil-bolivia-south-america.html One issue with expanding this reserve is that research needs to be done to choose the location of these reserves because the Cerrado biome is floristically very heterogeneous and constitutes a biological mosaic. Teams from the University of Bras√≠lia, CPAC and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh have been collaborating on this project for a number of years funded by Brazilian, European Community and British funds. The project has recently been expanded into a major Anglo-Brazilian initiative, Conservation and Management of the Biodiversity of the Cerrado Biome, with UK Overseas Development Administration funding1. Its aim is to survey the floristic patterns of Cerrado vegetation and to discover representative areas and biodiversity \`hot-spots'. =Protected areas= A 2017 assessment found that 433,581 km¬≤, or 23%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Chapada das Mesas National Park, Emas National Park, Grande Sert√£o Veredas National Park, Nascentes do Rio Parna√≠ba National Park, Serra do Cip√≥ National Park, Nascentes Geraizeiras Sustainable Development Reserve, Cavernas do Perua√ßu Environmental Protection Area, Iqu√™ Ecological Station, Serra Geral do Tocantins Ecological Station, Jalap√£o State Park, Serra de Santa B√°rbara State Park, and Terra Ronca State Park in Brazil, and Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in Bolivia.

He was working as a security contractor for Blackwater Security when he was killed in the 31 March 2004 Fallujah ambush within days of arriving in Iraq. Helvenston was a personal trainer for Hollywood celebrities such as Demi Moore (for G.I. Jane), and was also featured in the reality shows Combat Missions and Man vs. Beast (in the latter, he completed an obstacle course faster than a chimpanzee). He also starred in a reality series called Extreme Expeditions: Model Behavior months before he left for Iraq. The series was shot in Mexico and is finished, but has not yet aired. Helvenston's great-great-uncle was Secretary of War Elihu Root. He joined the Navy at 17 and became the youngest person to complete Navy SEAL training. He spent 12 years in the Navy SEALs until he left in 1994 as an E-6 (Quartermaster First Class). Helvenston began training at Blackwater USA's facilities in March 2004, and developed a personal conflict with head trainer Justin \\"Shrek\\" McQuown. Helvenston arrived in Kuwait on March 18, where he was under the management of John and Kathy Potter, whom he knew from Combat Missions. Contract Employee John Potter had helped Blackwater Security (since renamed Academi) win the contract to provide security for kitchen equipment convoys for the Kuwait company Regency Hotel and Hospital Company and Eurest Support Services (ESS was a subcontractor of Halliburton KBR). The contract billed Regency $815 a day; Helvenston and the other contractors were paid $600 a day. The original contract called for at least three men per vehicle on security missions \\"with a minimum of two armored vehicles to support ESS movements\\". In addition, the contract called for a heavily armed rear gunner, and time before any mission to review the route and conduct a risk assessment and pre-trip inspection. Blackwater signed a revised contract with Regency on March 12, 2004 that removed the word \\"armored\\". Potter insisted that his men be given armored vehicles, however, and was removed as project manager on March 24, replaced by Justin McQuown. McQuown On March 27, two days before Helvenston's scheduled deployment to Iraq, McQuown reassigned him to a team leaving on the 28th, over the objections of numerous other Blackwater employees. Helvenston believed McQuown resented him and deliberately reassigned Helvenston at the last minute. In one of Helvenston's final emails before his death, he wrote to the owner of Blackwater, claiming McQuown's behavior was \\"very manipulative, duplicitive [sic], immature and unprofessional,\\" with the hidden agenda \\"Lets [sic] see if we can screw with Scott.\\" On March 30, McQuown sent Helvenston out with three other contractors, Jerry Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, to guard a convoy for ESS traveling from Baghdad to a military base west of Fallujah. They were in two unarmored vehicles and had no map. Death Along with squad members Jerry \\"Jerko\\" Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, Helvenston was transporting food and other equipment in unarmored vehicles to the center of the city of Fallujah when the team was ambushed by insurgents. The four contractors were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Their bodies were dragged from their vehicles, beaten and set ablaze. Their burned and mutilated corpses were then dragged through the streets, and two of them hung from a bridge crossing the Euphrates. Photos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide. Aftermath The families of the four dead contractors, led by Helvenston's mother Katy Helvenston-Wettengel and Jerry Zovko's mother Donna Zovko, filed suit against Blackwater with lawyer Daniel Callahan on January 5, 2005 (Helvenston et al. v. Blackwater Security), alleging wrongful death. Blackwater responded by counter-suing for $10 million. In January 2011, both cases were thrown out of court by a federal judge. Counsel for the plaintiffs announced they would appeal the ruling.Baker, Mike, (Associated Press), \\"Blackwater Death Suit Tossed After Six Years\\", Washington Post, 26 January 2011, p. 4.

The band, led by John K. Samson, has released four studio albums and is currently inactive. History The band was formed in 1997 in Winnipeg, Manitoba by John K.

The origin of the band's name was explained, in 2004 by Samson, as having come from \\"a few places.\\" The first was a line from the 1992 film The Lover: \\"Go ahead, I'm weaker than you can possibly imagine.\\" A second (he gave only two) was a line from Ralph Chaplin's union anthem \\"Solidarity Forever\\": \\"What force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?\\" The band includes this line in the song \\"Pamphleteer\\" from the album Left and Leaving.

The Weakerthans, with support from Jim Bryson, at a 2007 concert in Toronto In 2003, the band moved to Epitaph Records and released Reconstruction Site. The album was met with positive reviews from Canadian and international critics for its ambitious combination of punk, rock, folk, country and sonnets. It also became the band's best-selling record to date, and in September appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart as a result of significant airplay on Canadian radio.\\"The National Top 50 For the Week Ending: Tuesday, September 16, 2003\\". !earshot. It was the second Weakerthans album to be produced by Ian Blurton. Sutton, who played on the band's first three albums, left in August 2004 and was replaced by Greg Smith. In 2005, Left and Leaving was named one of the ten best Canadian albums of all time in Chart magazine's reader poll. In the same poll, Samson wrote the capsule review for another top ten finisher, The Lowest of the Low's Shakespeare My Butt, which he cited as a major influence on his own music. Reunion Tour was released on September 25, 2007 in North America by Epitaph and ANTI-. The band released a video for \\"Civil Twilight\\", which consisted of a single, unbroken camera shot of the band on a Winnipeg Transit city bus. Epitaph also re-released the Weakerthans' first two albums, Fallow and Left and Leaving, in Canada on November 6, 2007.

In a subsequent interview with Canwest News Service, Samson clarified that the band would be taking some downtime over the summer of 2009 before deciding when to start working on their next album. Shortly afterward, Samson announced a series of solo 7\\" releases about Manitoba roads, which he planned to release over the next 18 months. The first, City Route 85, was released on October 30, 2009 through Epitaph and ANTI-.

Although trained in brawling, technical, and high-flying wrestling techniques, he spent most of his career as a manager and referee. Career Hildebrand (right) with Cody Michaels Hildebrand started out as a manager in 1984 in the independent territories in the northeastern United States. He was a heel manager, and he managed Cactus Jack at one time as an evil Jewish character named Hymie P. Weiss. In 1986, he began training at Dominic DeNucci's wrestling school in Freedom, Pennsylvania. He went on to Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) in 1992, where he was a referee under the ring name Mark Curtis and also wrestled occasionally as Kowabunga, fully costumed like a Ninja Turtle. Throughout his tenure in SMW as a referee, Hildebrand was known for wearing suspenders with his outfit. He also had brief heel work where he was allied with Jim Cornette, and made appearances in USWA along with Cornette. When SMW closed in 1995, he went on to work as a referee in Extreme Championship Wrestling, under his real name. After leaving ECW he went on to work as referee Mark Curtis in World Championship Wrestling. During his time in WCW, he earned the nickname The Shooter after a fan attempted to interfere in a match between Psychosis and Dean Malenko on the September 8, 1997 edition of Nitro. As the invading fan slid under the bottom rope to enter the ring, Hildebrand, who happened to have glanced over just as the man jumped the guard rail, kneed the fan in the face and placed the man in a guillotine choke, and held him there until WCW security could take him into custody. Play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone and color commentator Bobby Heenan found this amusing, with Heenan observing \\"The smallest referee in the world just took him down!\\" Hildebrand's likeness is used for the cartoon referee in WCW/nWo Revenge. Death and memorials Hildebrand was diagnosed with stomach and bowel cancer in October 1997. After having surgery in attempt to remove it, he continued refereeing for WCW throughout the following months. During the final stage of his disease in 1999, a Curtis Goes Home benefit was held in his hometown of Rostraver Township, Pennsylvania. Cody Michaels developed and promoted the event, which is viewed by wrestling insiders and experts as one of the truly memorable events in history that actually brought together the major companies at the time, World Wrestling Federation, World Championship Wrestling, and Extreme Championship Wrestling, in support for one of the most genuinely loved workers in the industry. The major stars that worked and provided support that night included Mick Foley, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Shane Douglas, Bruno Sammartino, Dominic DeNucci, Terry Taylor, D'Lo Brown, Al Snow, Hugh Morrus, Les Thatcher, Billy Kidman, Chris Candido, and many others. Hildebrand died from the disease on September 8, 1999 at the age of 37. He refereed one last match at a local independent show mere days before his death. Hildebrand's death was briefly acknowledged on the following edition of WCW Thunder, but the first WCW event to have taken place after his death was a house show on September 11 at the Baltimore Arena, which was held in his honor with a ten bell salute. Late in the show, friends Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit, and Dean Malenko (known as Revolution) shared heartfelt words about Hildebrand and dedicated the show to him. Southern States Wrestling held the Mark Curtis Memorial Weekend of Champions, an annual fundraiser for the Children's Miracle Network, from 2000 to 2003. Hildebrand also inspired the Mark Curtis Fantasy Camp 2001 a training event with Hugh Morrus on hand. A Mark Curtis Memorial Show would also be held on May 7, 2005 at Freedom Hall in Johnson City, Tennessee. The main event pitted Al Snow and D'Lo Brown against Shane Douglas and Mick Foley. It was announced on Sunday, February 25, 2018 that Michaels, Brian Hildebrand and Angie Minelli made up the Class of 2018 Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) Hall of Fame. The ceremony took place on Saturday, March 24, 2018 in Pittsburgh.http://www.kswadigest.com/2018/02/hildebrand-michaels-and-minelli- make-up.html See also * List of premature professional wrestling deaths References ;General * ;Specific External links Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets Category:1962 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Professional wrestling referees Category:Smoky Mountain Wrestling Category:20th-century American male actors ","title":"Brian Hildebrand"},{"id":"2143686","text":"Penguins at Punta Tombo, Chubut.A pair of Magellanic penguins protecting their nesting burrow Punta Tombo is a peninsula into the Atlantic Ocean south of Trelew in Chubut Province, Argentina, where there is a large colony of Magellanic penguins - the largest such colony in Argentina.

From 1959 to 1984 he served as music director for Radio Bremen. From the early 1960s onwards, Otte frequently presented contemporary experimental American composers in his Bremen radio festival Pro Musica Nova, among them in those days completely unknown people like John Cage, David Tudor, Terry Riley, and La Monte Young. From 1959 on, Otte lived and worked in Bremen, Germany. His catalogue of compositions contains more than 100 works. Otte had studied in Germany, Italy, and at Yale University in the United States. His teachers included the composer Paul Hindemith and the pianist Walter Gieseking. Some of Otte's works, especially his extended suites for solo piano, are characterized by very minimal means but are nevertheless quite subtle and sophisticated in their architecture and expression. Das Buch der Kl√§nge (The Book of Sounds, 1979‚Äì82) and Stundenbuch (Book of Hours, 1991‚Äì98) are his best known pieces in this genre, and Otte often performed them himself. His last public recital was given in Amsterdam in 1999. Recordings of these works, with Otte as performer, are available on CD. In his works, Otte drew significantly on European and Asian spirituality, integrating various prayers into the fabric of the music. In 1991 his work \\"KlangHaus\\" became a permanent interactive sound installation in the Neues Museum Weserburg Bremen in Bremen, Germany. A book, Hans Otte : Klang der Kl√§nge = Sound of sounds, by Ingo Ahmels (de), was published in 2006.

Its dark red fruit is considered a delicacy. In the Pacific Northwest of western Canada and the northwestern United States, it is sometimes called the nagoon or nagoonberry, a name which derives from the Tlingit neig√≥on. A measure of the quality of its fruit is expressed in its Russian name –∫–Ω—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ knyazhenika, signifying the \\"berry of princes\\". It grows in Alaska, northern Scandinavia and Finland, Russia, Poland, Belarus, Mongolia, northeastern China, North Korea, Estonia, Lithuania, Canada, and the northern United States as far south as Oregon, Colorado, Michigan, and Maine.  Description  Rubus arcticus grows most often in acidic soils rich in organic matter. It is a thornless perennial up to 30 cm (1 foot) tall, woody at the base but very thin farther above the ground. flowers are in groups of 1-3, the petals pink, red, or magenta. Fruit is deep red or dark purple, with an unusual hardiness to frost and cold weather conditions. Ripe Arctic raspberry  Uses  The fruits of the Arctic raspberry are very tasty and, among other uses, make jam and liqueur, or flavour tea. Carl von Linn√© considered the Arctic raspberry ‚Äì √•kerb√§r in Swedish ‚Äì a great delicacy in his Flora Lapponica (1737). Also used in Smirnoff Ice and North, and Lignell & Piispanen's Mesimarjalik√∂√∂ri, and Wine fruit of Arctic RaspBerry (Central Arctic in Adub). Arctic raspberry is the provincial plant of the Norrbotten province of northern Sweden.

Longeing has many benefits for both horses and riders.German National Equestrian Federation. Lungeing. Kenilworth Press 2003. . For a young or green (inexperienced) horse, longeing is used to teach a horse to respond to voice commands and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to the feel of a saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything it is going to be asked to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.Steinbrecht, Gustav. The Gymnasium of the Horse, p. 59. Xenophon Press 2011. . On horses of any age or level of experience, longeing is used to exercise a horse when it cannot be ridden, or when additional work is needed to develop balance, rhythm, and to improve the horse's gaits. It is also useful to help settle a horse before riding, especially a high-strung horse, a young horse, or a horse that has been confined more than usual. However, longeing for long periods or with the intent to tire a horse out can cause joint strain. It can be used to \\"blow off steam\\" or \\"get the bucks out\\" before a rider gets on, though proper turnout or liberty work is a better alternative, because a longeing session is training time, not play time. Longeing riders is valuable for teaching, as they may develop their seat and position without having to worry about controlling the horse. Classical schools of riding and training, such as the Spanish Riding School, require new riders to work extensively on the longe before they are allowed reins or stirrups, and riders are required to periodically return to longe work to refine their seat and balance. Equipment for longeing Longe cavesson fitted with a bridle. Also note front leg wraps and that the stirrups are put up to keep them from hitting the horse's side. =Longe line= The longe line (or longe) is typically about 30 feet (10 m) long, so the longeing circle can have a diameter of up to 60 feet (20 m). It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or Dacron. In the natural horsemanship tradition, the longe line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton longe lines are less likely to burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable and less likely to break. It may have a snap, buckle, or chain on one end to attach to a longeing cavesson or bridle. A chain , although sometimes used with difficult horses, has no subtlety of contact and is quite severe. In most cases, it is best to use a snap-end longe line. Many longe lines have a loop handle at the other end, but this is dangerous to use, as a person's hand can be trapped in the handle and be injured should the horse bolt. The longe line takes the place of the rein aids while longeing. It can be held in a rein hold (coming out the bottom of the hand) or a driving hold (coming out the top of the hand), and the extra line is folded back and forth rather than coiled, as coiled line can tighten and trap the trainer's hand or fingers if the horse bolts. =Longe whip= The whip usually has a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 5-6 feet (1.5-1.8 m) (although some are longer). The whip is light, easy to handle, and well balanced. It is not safe to use a riding or driving whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without bringing the handler close enough to the horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment. =Longeing cavesson= A horse wearing a longeing cavesson A longeing cavesson (alternate spelling caveson) is the classic headgear specialized for longeing, but in modern times is not the most commonly used equipment. It is a type of headstall with one to three rings on the noseband to which the longe line is attached. The most common point of attachment is the center ring at the top of the cavesson, which allows the horse to go both directions without having to stop and change the adjustment of the line. The two side rings are occasionally used for attachment of the longe line, but more often are used for attachment of side reins or long lines. The classic design is made of leather. The noseband is usually metal on top with padding beneath, providing good control of the horse, but no risk of injury to the head. Unlike a bridle, there is no chance of damaging the horse's mouth. Newer designs are made of nylon web, similar to some types of halter, with three rings and fleece padding underneath the noseband, often without the metal component. This style is less bulky, less expensive, and available in a very wide range of sizes, but without adequate stiffness to the noseband, may offer less precise control. A longeing cavesson may be used with or without a bridle. When used with a bridle containing a snaffle bit, the noseband of the bridle is removed, and the bridle goes over the longeing cavesson, to prevent pinching. The bridle cheekpieces sometimes need to be lengthened so that the bit still rests correctly in the mouth. When fitting a longe cavesson, the noseband must be on the nasal bone of the horse's nose, not on the cartilage. Nosebands that are too low are very uncomfortable for the horse and, in extreme cases, can cause damage to the cartilage if misused. The throatlatch of the cavesson must be snug enough to keep it from slipping over the horse's eye, or from falling off altogether, but not so tight as to restrict the windpipe if the horse flexes its neck properly in response to pressure from the bit and side reins. Some designs replace the throatlatch with a strap that is placed further down the cheek so as to not interfere with the windpipe when adjusted snugly. =Use of a bridle alone= A horse being longed in a bridle, showing some resistance. On a well-trained horse, a bridle may be used instead of a longeing cavesson. However, it is possible to injure a horse's mouth if the line is incorrectly attached or misused. Some sensitive horses may react badly to the attachment of the line to the bit, and some classical dressage masters considered this method to be crude. The bit used is a snaffle bit. Curb bits, having bit shanks of any kind are dangerous; the line can tangle in them, causing injury to the horse's mouth. When longed off a bridle, the reins are kept out of the way, either by removing them, or by twisting them once or twice over the neck and then running the throatlatch of the bridle under the reins before buckling it. The correct method is to run the longe line through the inside bit ring, over the poll, and attach it to the outside bit ring. This method of attaching the line requires it to be changed each time the horse changes direction. This method has a slight gag effect, raising the bit up and applying pressure on the corners of the mouth and placing pressure on the poll, but puts less lateral pressure on the bit. It is best for horses that pull, or when the trainer is longeing a rider, to ensure maximum control of the horse. If the longe line is attached just to the inside bit ring, the outside ring can slide through the mouth when the line is pulled and damage the horse's mouth. If the line is run through the inside bit ring, under the chin, and attached to the outside bit ring, the bit can pinch the horse's jaw, and it alters the action of the bit to put pressure on the roof of the horse's mouth. When a method of attachment causes more pain than control, the horse often resists the pressure and will not perform properly. =Halter= Longeing with a halter offers very little control, but may be suitable for basic exercise. This handler would have additional control if the longe line was attached to the side ring rather than under the jaw. A halter is used for basic exercise when a longeing cavesson or a bridle is not available. It offers very little control, less finesse, and does not give signals as clearly. When used with a bridle, the halter is placed on over the bridle. This sometimes is done when warming up a horse just prior to competition. The longe line is attached to the inside side ring of the halter noseband on a flat web halter, not the ring under the jaw. If it is attached under the jaw, not only is the halter apt to twist and slip out of place, possibly rubbing the horse in the eye and risking injury, but if the horse is disobedient, the handler has virtually no lateral leverage or control. Some rope halters have knots placed on the noseband and crownpiece that may apply some additional pressure if a longe line is placed under the jaw, which is the only place possible on a rope halter. =Protective boots or bandages= Horses' legs are often protected while longeing, as they are more likely to interfere when on a circle. Both bell boots and \\"brushing\\" or \\"splint\\" boots are often put on the front legs. Brushing boots are sometimes on the hind legs as well. Polo wraps are sometimes used instead of brushing boots. =Saddles and surcingles= A saddle is often worn when a horse is longeing. In these circumstances, it is important that the stirrups do not bang against the horse's side. On an English saddle, the stirrups are \\"run up.\\" To do this, run up the stirrups as they are kept when the saddle is off the horse, then bring the loop of stirrup leather around the stirrup iron before bringing it under the back branch and attaching looping the end of the leather (with the holes in it) through the stirrup leather keeper. Stirrups on a western saddle cannot be run up, so they are usually tied together under the belly of the horse with a piece of twine or rope, though for a very skittish young horse they also can be thrown up over the top of the saddle and tied down in that fashion. A surcingle or roller is a padded band that straps around the horse's girth area, and has rings around on its side for side reins, or long reins or other training equipment, such as an overcheck. It may also be used on a young horse to get it used to girth pressure. It may be used with or without an English saddle underneath. =Side reins= A horse properly equipped for vaulting with surcingle, leg wraps, side reins, and longeing cavesson Side reins are usually used for more advanced horses. They give the horse something to take contact with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self- carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the bit to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to the billets of the girth. Side reins are adjusted longer for less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from point of shoulder up to the point of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A good starting point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4 inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical. Side reins are adjusted so they are the same length on either side, or slightly shorter on the inside. Side reins adjusted too tightly can cause a horse to go behind the bit, deaden the mouth and in extreme cases cause the horse to feel trapped, leading to rearing and the possibility that the horse will flip over. A horse is warmed up and cooled down without the side reins, allowing the neck to stretch down and the back muscles to relax. Side reins are most useful for work in the trot and canter, where the neck, back and hindquarter muscles are engaged. Working a horse in side reins at the walk actually discourages a relaxed, forward-moving gait. Side reins are not used for jumping, as they restrict the use of the neck too much, and may even cause the horse to fall. =Equipment for the trainer= Wearing gloves when longeing prevents rope burns if the horse pulls the line hard. Proper boots are also necessary, and at a minimum, shoes with an enclosed toe are a must. A helmet is also sometimes worn, especially if the horse tends to kick at the trainer. It is wise not to wear spurs, which can get caught on the line and cause the trainer to trip. Use of the aids Rider being longed on a horse by a riding instructor =Longe line= The longe line takes the place of the rider's rein aids. It may be held like a riding rein, with the line running to the horse held between the fourth and fifth finger, or held like a driving rein, with it running between the thumb and pointer finger. The elbow is softly bent, with the arm at an approximately 90-degree angle. The horse and handler should not pull, jerk, or \\"hang\\" on the line. Like rein aids while riding, signals are given smoothly and as softly as possible to get the desired response, with aids given by squeezing or turning the hand. The longe line traveling from the horse to the hand is held in the hand in which direction the horse is moving (so if the horse is working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If the horse were to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something. * Opening rein: where the lead hand moves to the side and out, away from the trainer's body. It helps to lead the horse forward. * Direct rein: a squeeze and release on the line backwards helps to keep the horse from moving out on the circle, causes the horse to bend inward, or asks the horse to make the circle smaller. * Indirect rein: where the longe hand moves back and sideways towards the other hip. It asks the horse to slow or halt. * Giving the longe: briefly releasing the line towards the horse's head, before re-establishing contact. Acts as a reward, asks the horse to lower its head, or asks the horse to move out onto a larger circle. The line should not drag or become very loose when this is performed. * Vibrating: several short, brief squeezes of the longe line. Used to halt or slow the horse down without pulling. * Half-halting: as in riding, it is used for re-balancing the horse, calling the animal's attention to the trainer, and preparing it for a command. Must be used in conjunction with the whip and voice. =Whip= The longe whip takes the place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, pointing towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse. * Pointing the whip at the shoulder is used to make the horse move out or stops him from moving inward on the circle. * Pointing the whip, and making a forward rotating movement, at the hocks asks the horse to increase speed or impulsion. * Pointing the whip in front of the head, going under the longe line, can be used to ask a horse to slow or halt. * Cracking the whip is reserved for extreme cases, such as a horse that refuses to move forward. If overused, the horse may begin to ignore it. Cracking upsets some horses. If a crack is needed, it is done behind the hindquarters. * Touching the horse with the lash is used to make the horse move strongly forward. The lash is usually applied where the rider's leg would be, in the girth area. It may also be used on the hindquarters, although this causes some horses to kick, or on the shoulder, to prevent the horse from running inward. It is usually used only lightly, in an upward motion. =Voice= The voice is used in the same manner as when riding. It is used mainly for transitions, praise, or to express displeasure. Although the voice is not commonly used for riding, it is very important in longeing. However, overuse of voice to encourage impulsion will cause a horse to ignore the trainer. Voice commands used in longeing are identical to voice commands used when leading or riding the horse, but more voice commands are used when longeing than at other times. All words used in transitions for longeing are spoken slowly, clearly and each command should be phonetically distinct from and others. For upward transitions the voice might raise to a higher pitch, downward transitions should lower the pitch. A trainer may cluck or make another type of chirping or kissing sound to increase speed or impulsion. * A word, such as the name of the horse, or simply a word like \\"and...\\" can be used as a \\"half-halt,\\" essentially to warn the horse that a command is coming. A word other than whoa is used to calm a horse (such as \\"easy\\" or \\"steady\\"), spoken in a low tone and calm manner. Similarly, a word such as \\"quit!\\" can be spoken in a displeased tone when the horse misbehaves; as \\"no\\" can be confused with \\"whoa\\" by the horse. A word for praise (such as \\"good boy\\") can be used if horse responds correctly to a command. Longe area It is safest to longe in an enclosed area. If the horse escapes, it will be easier to catch, and an enclosed area will make him easier to control on the longe. Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20-25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best if there is no one riding in the longeing area. The footing should not be slippery, to help prevent slipping and injuries. The ground should be relatively flat for the horse's balance. The circle should be large (approx. 20 meters), as smaller circles tend to increase strain on the horse's joints and ligaments. Roundpenning, liberty work and \\"free longeing\\" Liberty work at a circus. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, c. 1887-88 In the field of natural horsemanship, it is a common practice to work a horse loose in a round pen in diameter. ( feet is considered standard). This is sometimes called free longeing or work at liberty, because the horse is asked to travel in a circle and obey human commands, only without a longe line attached. The handler uses voice, body language and a lariat or a longe whip to give commands to the horse, eventually teaching it to speed up, slow down, stop and change direction on command. A variation of these techniques are also used by circus trainers to train horses and other animals, such as elephants to work in a ring for exhibition purposes. Both single animals and groups of animals can be trained to perform at liberty. These types of liberty work are considered schooling disciplines and to simply turn a horse loose in a small pen and make it run around to get exercise is not free longeing. Time limits Work in small circles is stressful on a horse's legs, so it is best to limit a longeing session to about 20 minutes. Gaits should be changed frequently, and the horse should be worked for equal time in both directions so that both sides of the horse are worked evenly and to keep the work interesting for the horse.

It is one of the largest Broadway theatres with 1,681 seats, and traditionally has been used as a venue for major musical theatre productions. Among the notable shows that have premiered at the Majestic are Carousel (1945), South Pacific (1949), The Music Man (1957), Camelot (1960), A Little Night Music (1973), and The Wiz (1975). It was also the second home of 42nd Street and the third home of 1776. The theatre has housed The Phantom of the Opera since it opened on January 26, 1988. With a record-breaking over 13,300 performances to date, it is currently the longest-running production in Broadway history. History Designed by architect Herbert J. Krapp, the present-day Majestic was constructed by the Chanin Brothers as part of an entertainment complex including the Theatre Masque, the Royale Theatre, and Lincoln Hotel (now the Row NYC Hotel, and previously the Milford Plaza). It opened on March 28, 1927 with the musical Rufus LeMaire's Affairs. The theater was designed in a Spanish style, with Adam style detailing within the auditorium, a large single balcony, and steep stadium seating in the orchestra section, all under an expansive plaster dome. A large staircase leads patrons up to the orchestra level one story above the expansive street frontage. On the Spanish terracotta and stone facade, ornate loggia mask the fire escapes from the auditorium, mirroring the neighboring St. James Theatre across 44th Street. With 1,681 seats, the Majestic is one of the largest of the Broadway theaters, and has been home to primarily large musicals in its ninety year history. The venue hosted the 50th Tony Awards in 1996, on the set of Phantom. The Majestic was purchased by the Shubert brothers during the Great Depression and currently is owned and operated by the Shubert Organization. Both the interior and exterior were designated New York City landmarks in 1987, just prior to the theater's current long-running tenant, The Phantom of the Opera. For Phantom, the theater's stage was expanded and modified extensively to fit the show's complex scenic elements, the Shuberts spending more than $1 million to accommodate the show after considering the Martin Beck and Mark Hellinger theaters with the show's producer Cameron Mackintosh, and moving long-running tenant 42nd Street was moved across the street to the St. James. Much of the theater's large, ornate proscenium arch has been obscured and painted black since Phantom's installation in 1987. A long alleyway connects the theater backstage to the surrounding Golden, Jacobs and Broadhurst theaters.

Other common names - some for particular groups of rhinoceros beetles - include Hercules beetles, unicorn beetles or horn beetles. Over 1500 species and 225 genera of rhinoceros beetles are known. Many rhinoceros beetles are well known for their unique shapes and large sizes. Some famous species are, for example, the Atlas beetle (Chalcosoma atlas), common rhinoceros beetle (Xylotrupes ulysses), elephant beetle (Megasoma elephas), European rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes nasicornis), Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules), Japanese rhinoceros beetle or kabutomushi (Allomyrina dichotoma), ox beetle (Strategus aloeus) and the Eastern Hercules beetle (Dynastes tityus). Description and ecology European rhinoceros beetle - three stages from larva to adult: Larva (back), pupa (center), imago (front) The Dynastinae are among the largest of beetles, reaching more than in length, but are completely harmless to humans because they cannot bite or sting. Some species have been anecdotally claimed to lift up to 850 times their own weight.Rodger Kram: Inexpensive Load Carrying By Rhinoceros Beetles. The Journal of Experimental Biology 199, 609‚Äì612 (1996) Their common names refer to the characteristic horns borne only by the males of most species in the group. Each has a horn on the head and another horn pointing forward from the center of the thorax. The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging. The size of the horn is a good indicator of nutrition and physical health. The body of an adult rhinoceros beetle is covered by a thick exoskeleton. A pair of thick wings lie atop another set of membranous wings underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly, although not very efficiently, owing to its large size. Their best protection from predators is their size and stature. Additionally, since they are nocturnal, they avoid many of their predators during the day. When the sun is out, they hide under logs or in vegetation to camouflage themselves from the few predators big enough to want to eat them. If rhinoceros beetles are disturbed, some can release very loud, hissing squeaks. The hissing squeaks are created by rubbing their abdomens against the ends of their wing covers. Rhinoceros beetles are relatively resilient; a healthy adult male can live up to 2‚Äì3 years. The females rarely live long after they mate. These beetles' larval stages can be several years long. The larvae feed on rotten wood and the adults feed on nectar, plant sap and fruit. First, the larvae hatch from eggs and later develop into pupae before they reach adult status (see picture at left). The females lay 50 eggs on average. Contrary to what their size may imply, adult rhinoceros beetles do not eat large amounts, unlike their larvae, which eat a significant amount of rotting wood. Mating Male Japanese rhinoceros beetles, (Allomyrina dichotoma) fight to dominate sap sites. Males use their horns to pry rival males off the area, and gives them the chance to mate with the female. In this and other species that defend mating sites, larger males with larger horns mate more frequently, as they win more contests. Small males often avoid larger males and exhibit alternative strategies gain access to females.  Interactions with humans  = Use by humans = Rhinoceros beetles have become popular pets in parts of Asia,\\"WHO? KNEW\\" (May 6, 2005) Current Science Vol.90 No.16 due to being relatively clean, easy to maintain, and safe to handle. Also in Asia, male beetles are used for gambling fights.Rhinoceros beetle gambling in Thailand Since males naturally have the tendency to fight each other for the attention of females, they are the ones used for battle. To get the two male beetles to lock in combat, a female beetle is used, or a small noisemaker duplicating the female's mating call. Entomologist S√©verin Tchibozo suggests the larvae contain much more protein (40%), than chicken (20%) and beef (approximately 18%) and they could become a protein source for a large human population.Global Steak - Demain nos enfants mangeront des criquets (2010 French documentary) Dr. MinJun Kim, leading a team of engineers in National Science Foundation-funded research, examined the function and aerodynamics of Allomyrina dichotoma, with the help of researchers in Drexel University's Mechanical Engineering Department and in collaboration with Konkuk University in South Korea. Rhinoceros beetles could play a big part in the next generation of aircraft design. = As a pest = Some species can become major pests, e.g., in tree plantations. Usually though, beetle population densities are not as high as in some other pest insects, and food trees which are typically already sick or dying from some other cause are preferred. Some species' larvae, however, will attack healthy trees or even root vegetables, and when they occur in large numbers, can cause economically significant damage. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is a proven biocontrol agent for beetle infestation in crops.

He presided over a period of crisis, having to confront the large-scale Kharijite rebellion of Abu Yazid. He succeeded in suppressing the revolt and restoring the stability of the Fatimid regime.  Early life and accession  The future al-Mansur Billah was born Isma'il, in early January 914, in the palace city of Raqqada near Kairouan. He was the son of the then heir-apparent and future second Fatimid imam‚Äìcaliph, Muhammad al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah (), and a local slave concubine, Karima, who had once belonged to the last Aghlabid emir of Ifriqiya, Ziyadat Allah III. Isma'il was not the oldest son of al-Qa'im; but the firstborn, al- Qasim, reportedly predeceased his father. According to the official version of events, on 12 April 946, al-Qa'im publicly proclaimed Isma'il as his heir, with the regnal name of al-Mansur Billah, and when he died on 17 May, al- Mansur became imam and caliph. Modern historians of the Fatimid period, such as Heinz Halm and Michael Brett, suspect that al-Mansur's rise to power was the result of a palace intrigue headed by the influential slave chamberlain Jawdhar, with the participation of other figures from al-Qa'im's harem. Several factors suggest this: given al-Qa'im's debilitating illness, it is unclear whether he was at all capable of proclaiming a successor; the first act of the new caliph was to confine his uncles and brothers to house arrest in the palace, under the supervision of Jawdhar; Jawdhar, in his memoirs, claims that Isma'il had been secretly nominated as father's heir already at the time of al-Qa'im's own accession in 934, with Jawdhar himself being the only one entrusted his secret; and al-Mansur himself was apparently obliged to compose a tract defending his succession, which points to the contested nature of his accession.  Reign  = Suppression of the rebellion of Abu Yazid = At the time of his accession, the Fatimid Caliphate was undergoing on of its most critical moments: a large-scale rebellion under the Kharijite Berber preacher Abu Yazid had overrun Ifriqiya and was threatening the capital al- Mahdiya itself. As a result, in the words of the historian Farhat Dachraoui, \\"he had to face up to, immediately, the heaviest responsibilities without having served any apprenticeship as ruler\\". Al-Mansur would prove up to the task: both Isma'ili (pro-Fatimid) and Sunni (anti-Fatimid) sources agree that al-Mansur proved an exemplary ruler, praising both his erudition and eloquence in Classical Arabic as well as his bravery and energetic leadership in battle. While the revolt of Abu Yazid lasted, al-Mansur and his government hid the death of his father, a task made easier by the reclusive life al-Qa'im had led, rarely venturing out of his palace during his reign. All public business and ceremonies were still conducted in al-Qa'im's name, and Isma'il acted ostensibly only as his heir-designate. Indeed, the regnal name of al-Mansur was only publicly assumed after the final suppression of the uprising. Nevertheless, the new ruler quickly gave proof of his ability. Already before his father's death, on 16 May, he sent by sea weapons and supplies to Sousse, and within days launched a coordinated attack to relieve the city: on 26 May, the garrison of Sousse, assisted by Kutama Berber cavalry from the south and troops landed by sea from the north, broke the siege of the city and forced Abu Yazid to withdraw his forces inland towards Kairouan.  Battle for Kairouan  Abu Yazid found Kairouan in rebellion against him, and the city gates closed, so that he established a camp two days' march from the city. In the meantime, al-Mansur had met with a delegation of Kairouan notables at Sousse, and issued a full amnesty in return for their renewed loyalty. On 28 May, the caliph's proclamation was read in the city, and on the same day the Fatimid army, headed by the caliph himself, set up camp south of the city. The Fatimid prince was forced to lead by example to convince the unruly Kutama to fortify the camp with a ditch and wall, since the Berbers considered this a sign of cowardice and regarded digging as slaves' work; only after al-Mansur himself took the spade and began digging were they persuaded to help. Abu Yazid attacked the camp on the morning of 5 June, and was only thrown back with great difficulty. According to an eyewitness account, al-Mansur played a leading role in repelling the attack, his ceremonial parasol conspicuously displayed and serving as a rallying point, but it is possible that his role has been embellished for legitimization purposes. The two armies remained entrenched around Kairouan for the next two months, engaging in frequent clashes. Abu Yazid tried several times to take the city gates by assault, but al-Mansur had established smaller fortified camps to protect them. Abu Yazid tried to force the Fatimids to withdraw by sending his son to raid the environs of al-Mahdiya, where many of the Kutama had settled their families; but although al-Mansur sent some troops to shield them, he refused to move his main army. While al-Mansur was slowly building up his numerically inferior forces with contingents from the remote provinces of the Fatimid empire, Abu Yazid's support began to dwindle as his followers abandoned his camp; only the Hawwara and Banu Kamlan Berbers remained steadfastly loyal to him. With increasing confidence, al-Mansur marched his army out to provoke a pitched battle, but Abu Yazid refused. Finally, on 13 August the Fatimids stormed the rebel camp, and Abu Yazid with his troops broke and fled. The victory proved doubly fortuitous for al-Mansur: seeking support against the Fatimids, Abu Yazid had made contact with the Spanish Umayyads and recognized the suzerainty of Caliph Abd al-Rahman III. An Umayyad fleet had been dispatched to assist him, but when its commander heard news of the Fatimid victory at Kairouan, he turned back. Even in his victory dispatch to the capital, read out by the chamberlain Jawdhar, al-Mansur upheld the fiction of the still living al- Qa'im, describing himself merely as the \\"Sword of the Imam\\". The Fatimid ruler now set about achieving a reconciliation with the citizens of Kairouan: he abstained from appointing an Isma'ili qadi over the city as before, instead choosing the old and respected Malikite faqih Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Manzur; he did not appoint a Kutama as governor, but a military officer of Slavic origin, Qudam al-Fata; remitted all taxes for two years; and offered much of the captured booty as alms to the city poor. At the same time, al-Mansur ordered that the site of his camp south of the city be made into a new palace city, known officially as al-Mansuriya and locally as Sabra. Aside from thus immortalizing his victory, the prospect of the caliphal residence returning to the vicinity of Kairouan, the old capital of Ifriqiya, was another sign of caliphal favour to the Kairouanese. While at Kairouan, on 18 October al-Mansur received an envoy of the Byzantine Empire. It is unknown what the envoy's business with the Caliph was, but it most likely concerned the renewal of a truce that was in effect between the two powers in southern Italy, which suited both powers at the time.  Pursuit of Abu Yazid  While al-Mansur remained at Kairouan, in the north al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi had gathered fresh Kutama forces at Constantine and recaptured B√©ja and Tunis, securing the caliph's northern flank. Reinforced with a thousand cavalry from the Cyrenaica, al-Mansur, set out from Kairouan on 24 October in the direction of Sbiba. From there the Fatimid army marched to Bajaya, which had resisted the rebels' attacks, and welcomed the Fatimid troops as liberators. Ibn Hazar, the leader of the Zenata Berbers, sent an envoy to declare his allegiance. This in turn forced Abu Yazid to flee to the south and bypass the Zenata territories through the desert. Al-Mansur followed him until Biskra, but the local guides counseled against following the rebel leader as the route was dangerous for an army. At Biskra, the governor of Msila and the Zab region, Ja'far ibn Ali ibn Hamdun, presented himself to the caliph in submission, bringing with him a youth who was being hailed as a prophet in the Aur√®s region. After parading him through the camp, al-Mansur had the youth skinned alive and stuffed. When the caliph learned that Abu Yazid had found refuge in the Jabal Salat mountains, west of the Chott el Hodna lake, he led his army north to Tubna and then west, along the northern shore of Chott el Hodna. Abu Yazid confronted the Fatimid army at the town of Magra on 9 December, but was defeated. Following the victory, delegations from the tribes and settlements of the region began arriving at Msila to declare their loyalty to al-Mansur, including Ibn Hazar's son, Ya'qub. Shortly after, Abu Yazid launched an attack on al-Mansur's army camp near Msila, but was again beaten back. Al-Mansur sent his troops into the Hodna Mountains to pursue the rebel, but Abu Yazid again fled to the Jabal Salat. When the Fatimid troops pursued him there, he again fled to the desert, and this time al-Mansur was determined to follow him. After a grueling eleven-day march in the desert he was forced to turn back, only for the heavy winter to take further toll on his army. Barred from following Abu Yazid, al-Mansur instead turned north, to the territory of the Sanhaja Berbers, whose leader, Ziri ibn Manad, had once submitted to al-Qa'im. Ziri came forth and presented himself in person to the Fatimid caliph, and was richly rewarded. After giving the command to turn back east, al-Mansur fell heavily ill to a fever on 10 January 947, and remained bedridden for a fortnight. Following his recovery, he made for Msila. Abu Yazid had now settled in the ruined fortress of Azbih (the Byzantine-era Zabi Iustiniana) near Msila. Al-Mansur sent orders for fresh Kutama levies to be undertaken in their homelands in Lesser Kabylia, while Ibn Hazar repeated his protestations of loyalty, which included asking for the proper formula for the khutba to be used in the Friday prayer and the coinage. This request signalled the final acceptance of Fatimid sovereignty by the Zenata. The adherence of the Zenata also meant that Abu Yazid was cut off from supplies. On 6 March, al-Mansur, accompanied by 4,000 of his own cavalry and 500 Sanhaja, set out for Azbih. They found the fortress deserted, but as they turned back, the rear guard was suddenly attacked by Abu Yazid and his men. In the ensuing battle, the Fatimid ruler again prevailed, and Abu Yazid, wounded, barely managed to escape. Along with his letter announcing his victory, al-Mansur sent 1070 severed heads of rebels to Kairouan. Siege of Kiyana and death of Abu Yazid Abu Yazid fled once more to the Hodna Mountains, and al-Mansur pursued him there. The Fatimid troops pursued the rebel leader relentlessly, over narrow mountain paths. Abu Yazid's camp was captured and torched, but he managed to find refuge in the fortress of Kiyana (close to the later Beni Hammad Fort). Al- Mansur did not immediately attack him there; rather, after awaiting further Kutama levies, he set about methodically subduing the mountains, thus preventing Abu Yazid from finding refuge should he again manage to escape. Only following the end of Ramadan, on 26 April, did he move against the fortress, amidst torrential rain. The fortress, located on a steep rock on a mountain plateau, was placed under siege, with siege engines shipped from Ifriqiya over sea and carried over the mountains. The besieged tried repeatedly to break the siege with sallies, but were pushed back. In early June, the neighbouring fortresses of Shakir and Aqqar, also held by rebels, surrendered, and on 14 August 947, the final attack on Kiyana was launched. Dressed in gold-embroidered red clothes, al-Mansur participated in the combat in person atop his horse. After bitter fighting, around noon the defence was broken, and the besieged withdrew to a keep. Al-Mansur offered a pardon if they would hand over Abu Yazid, but they refused. At dawn on the next day, the besieged tried to break through to safety, but were defeated. Abu Yazid managed to escape, but fell in a ravine and was captured. Heavily wounded, he was interrogated by the caliph, before dying of his injuries after four days, on 19 August. His skin was salted and stuffed, to be paraded in public in every town the victorious caliph passed on his way back. Abu Yazid's defeat was a watershed moment for the Fatimid dynasty. As the historian Michael Brett comments, \\"in life, Abu Yazid had brought the [Fatimid] dynasty to the brink of destruction; in death he was a godsend\\", as it allowed the dynasty to relaunch itself following the failures of al-Qa'im's reign. For this purpose, he was immortalized in Fatimid historiography as the \\"False Messiah\\" (), and the rebellion was conceived as an apocalyptic event foreseen by al-Mahdi, for which purpose he had constructed al-Mahdiyya, \\"as a refuge for the dynasty from the great enemy, and a citadel from which the whole world would then be conquered\\", and the victory over it as a veritable resurrection of the dynasty. On the very day of Abu Yazid's death, al-Mansur declared himself as the imam and caliph, and publicly assumed his regnal title of , \\"The Conqueror with the Help of God\\". =Consolidation of Fatimid rule in the Maghreb= During the army's return to Msila, they were attacked by some Zenata who had refused to submit along with their leader Ibn Hazar. According to Heinz Halm, this was \\"the last uprising against Fatimid rule in the central Maghreb\\". Even Abu Yazid's most determined partisans, the Banu Kamlan, soon submitted to Fatimid authority in exchange for a pardon. One of the Jedars, visited by al- Mansur during his sojourn in Tahert in 947 Al-Mansur now intended to head back east, but was thwarted when news arrived of the loss of Tahert. The city had been conquered by the Fatimids already in 909, but was only tenuously held, under the semi-autonomous rule of the leaders of the Berber Miknasa tribe; one of them, Hamid ibn Yasal, had been imprisoned by al-Qa'im in al-Mahdiya, but managed to escape to the Umayyad court. With their aid, he had sailed back to the Maghreb and taken over Tahert on behalf of Abd al-Rahman III. The Fatimid caliph set out from Msila on 7 September to recover the city, but when he arrived at Tahert on the 20th, he found Hamid gone: he and his followers had sailed back to Spain. In retaliation, the caliph dug out the bones of his relatives and had them and the minbar of the mosque, from which the Friday prayer had been read in the name of his Umayyad rival, burned. While at Tahert, al-Mansur again fell heavily ill and was close to death, even to the point of having his last will written up. After recovering, he led an expedition against the Luwata Berbers, but as they retreated into the desert, it failed to achieve anything. The caliph also spent some time sightseeing, visiting the waterfalls at Oued Tiguiguest, and the Jedars, the late antique tumuli of Oued Mina. In the latter place, he had an inscription erected by Solomon, a general of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, translated for him. Leaving the court eunuch Masrur as governor in Tahert, he set out on the return journey east on 2 January 948, and eleven days later entered his new capital, al-Mansuriya, in triumph, through the \\"Gate of Victories\\" (). On 14 February, he left al-Mahdiya to confront Abu Yazid's son Fadl, who was still resisting the Fatimids in the Aur√®s. The caliphal army marched through Sbeitla to Gafsa, with the rebels withdrawing before them without giving combat and retreating to their bases in the Aur√®s. The campaign was apparently chiefly designed to bolster the credentials of al-Mansur's designated heir, Ma'add (the future al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah), so after sacking the fortress of Mid√®s and laying waste to its environs, in which the Fatimid prince suitably distinguished himself, the army returned to yet another triumphal entry into al-Mansuriya on 28 March. Soon after, the court left the new capital, which was not yet completed, for al-Mahdiya, where al-Mansur for the first time celebrated Eid al-Fitr on 13 April as caliph with extensive pomp. In his sermon in the mosque, al-Mansur publicly interpreted his victory over the \\"False Messiah\\" as a sign of divine favour, remarking that God \\"wishes to renew and strengthen our dynasty\\". As a sign of his new confidence, al-Mansur at this time released twenty members of the Aghlabid dynasty who had been held prisoners since 909: they were given rich presents and allowed to leave for Egypt. In the meantime, Abu Yazid's son Fadl was killed through treachery by the governor of Mdila. His severed head was dispatched to the caliph, who sent it together with the stuffed skin of his father to Sicily. The ship sank, but Abu Yazid's corpse was washed ashore at al-Mahdiya, where it was crucified and publicly displayed. Abu Yazid's other sons, Yazid and Ayyub, tried to continue the resistance in the Aur√®s, but they too were soon after killed. =Revolt in Sicily and relations with Byzantium and the Umayyads= On 25 April 947, a revolt led by the Banu al-Tabari family in Palermo deposed the Fatimid governor of Sicily, Ibn Attaf. The rebels held Ibn Attaf to be too weak and passive against the Byzantines in southern Italy, allowing the latter to stop paying the agreed-upon tribute in exchange for the truce. This was a major grievance for the leading Sicilian Arab clans, who depended on the tribute in the absence of opportunities to gather plunder through raids. To deal with the uprising, al-Mansur chose a man who had distinguished himself in the suppression of Abu Yazid's revolt, the governor of Tunis, al-Hasan ibn Ali al- Kalbi, who was appointed as the new governor of Sicily. When he arrived at al- Mansuriya in January 948, he brought with him the Byzantine strategos of Calabria. His mission is unclear, but likely the Byzantines were anxious to renew the truce, which was being threatened by events in Sicily, where the new dominant faction might relaunch raids against them in the name of jihad, seeking plunder. In spring 948, al-Hasan al-Kalbi arrived at Mazara with a fleet and an army, while unbeknownst to him, the rebels sent a delegation to petition a new governor from al-Mansur. Once al-Kalbi arrived in Sicily, he was informed of the delegation's mission, but marched on Palermo nonetheless. The rebels quickly lost support, and the leading notables surrendered the city to him without battle. Al-Kalbi imprisoned the leaders of the rebels, as did al-Mansur with the rebel delegation in Ifriqiya. The swift restoration of Fatimid control over Sicily also appears to have brought a renewal of the truce with Byzantium for three years, and likely the payment of the arrears in tribute. Al-Hasan al-Kalbi would become the first of a series of Kalbid governors of the island, who would rule it as Fatimid viceroys until 1053. Great Mosque of Kairouan In early September 948, the Fatimid court moved to al-Mansuriya, which now became the official caliphal residence. The state mint, treasury, and clothing factories remained behind at al-Mahidya, under the supervision of Jawdhar. As the mosque of the new capital was unfinished, al-Mansur became the only Fatimid caliph to pray and hold the Friday prayer at the Great Mosque of Kairouan. The truce with Byzantium did not last long. In 949, the Byzantines and Umayyads exchanged embassies to their respective courts, and apparently agreed on an anti-Fatimid league: in the following summer, the Byzantines attacked Fatimid positions in southern Italy, while in 951 the Umayyad fleet captured Tangier, giving the Umayyad court another base (along with Ceuta) with which to exert influence on the tribes and rulers of the western Maghreb and promote an anti-Fatimid coalition among them. Learning of the arrival of fresh Byzantine troops in Italy, al-Hasal al-Kalbi sought reinforcements from Ifriqiya. Al-Mansur supervised the preparations at Tunis in person, putting the expeditionary force of 10,500 men under the command of the Slavic eunuch Faraj (or Farakh). In May 951, the Fatimids landed near Rhegion and attacked Gerace without success, leaving after a payment of tribute, once the Byzantine relief army approached the town. The same was repeated at Cassano, before al-Hasan al-Kalbi and Faraj led their forces back to Sicily, to winter quarters in Messina. Although the Byzantines also withdrew their forces to Apulia, this enraged al-Mansur, who berated his commanders for their timidity. Obeying the caliph's orders, the next spring, the two Fatimid commanders again landed in Calabria. On 7 May, the Fatimids dealt a heavy defeat on the Byzantine army under Malakenos and Paschalis near Gerace, and proceeded to sack both it and Petracucca. As a result, the Byzantines offered to renew the truce against the payment of a tribute. As a sign of his success, al-Hasan al-Kalbi erected a mosque in Reggio, and obliged the Byzantines to not allow any Muslim to use it and to seek refuge and asylum there. Death and legacy Al-Mansur spent most of his reign in recurring bouts of heavy illness, that at times led him almost to death. Nevertheless he continued to be active in government, and, in marked contrast to his father, to show himself in public events and festivals, until the end of his life. The last such occasion was on 19 February 953l, when he led the ceremonies for the Eid al-Fitr, reciting in person the prayer at Kairouan. He died on 19 March, leaving his realm to his son Ma'ad, who became caliph as al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (). Al-Mansur's, first as impotent heir-apparent and then as a stoically suffering ruler, was exalted in later Isma'ili teachings as an exemplar and as a sacrifice that redeemed the faithful. At the same time, his life and untimely death kindled popular imagination. As the historian Heinz Halm remarks, \\"if al-Mansur comes off just as badly as the other Fatimids in the books of the intransigent Malikis, the youthful victor over the terrible hordes of Abu Yazid still appears to have been popular with the inhabitants of Kairouan und for the first time have chieved something like loyalty towards his house\\".

It lies adjoining the Krishnarajasagara Dam which is built across the river Kaveri. The work on laying out this garden was started in the year 1927 and completed in 1932. Visited by close to 2 million tourists per year, the garden is one of the major attractions of Srirangapatna. Sir Mirza Ismail, the Deewan of Mysore, a man with a penchant for gardens, founded the Brindavan Gardens (Krishnaraja Sagar Dam in particular) and built the Cauvery River high-level canal to irrigate 120,000 acres (490 km2) in modern Mandya district. He was inspired by Hyder Ali who had earlier built the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens at Bangalore. Krishana Raja Sagara Dam Statue of Kaveri at the Dam Garden The garden is maintained by the Cauvery Niravari Nigama (Cauvery Irrigation Corporation), a Government of Karnataka enterprise. It is spread across an area of . Adjoining it is also a fruit orchard spread across and 2 horticultural farms, Nagavana (30 acres) and Chandravana (5 acres). The garden is laid out in 3 terraces which contain water fountains, Ficus trees, foliage plants such as Duranta plumaria and Euphorbia and flowering plants like Celosia, Marigold and bougainvillea. The garden is open to the public and an entry-fee is charged. The garden also has topiary works (sculptures of animals created by clipping shrubs), pergolas (shaded passageway covered by creepers) and gazebos. The main attraction of the park is the musical fountain in which bursts of water are synchronised to the music of songs. There is also a lake within the garden with boating facilities available for visitors. The garden was renovated in 2005 with a cost of Rs. 50 million. The renovation included sprucing up the musical fountain using a digitised system and repairs of dysfunctional fountains. In 2007, the Gardens were closed for a brief duration as a safety measure to avoid trouble related to the Cauvery water dispute. Finances In the year 2003-2004, the gate collection was Rs. 2.07 crores, which increased to Rs 2.69 crores in 2004-05 and Rs 4.3 crores in 2005-06. This revenue is shared between Cauvery Niravari Nigam and Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) in the ratio 3:1.
