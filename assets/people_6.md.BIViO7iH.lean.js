They were designed in response to the battleships being built by Germany. Only four hulls of the fifteen originally planned had been laid down by 1940, when the decision was made to cut the program to only three ships to divert resources to an expanded army rearmament program. These ships would have rivaled the Imperial Japanese and America's planned in size if any had been completed, although with significantly weaker firepower: nine guns compared to the nine guns of the Japanese ships and a dozen on the Montanas. The failure of the Soviet armor plate industry to build cemented armor plates thicker than would have negated any advantages from the Sovetsky Soyuz class's thicker armor in combat. Construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the Soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships. One battleship, Sovetskaya Belorussiya, was cancelled on 19 October 1940 after serious construction flaws were found. Construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late 1940s. Design and development Design work began in 1935 on new battleships in response to the existing and planned German battleships,Westwood, p. 202 and the Soviets made extensive efforts in Italy and the United States to purchase either drawings or the ships themselves in the late 1930s.McLaughlin, pp. 362‚Äì72 The Italian firm of Gio. Ansaldo & C. proposed a ship of standard displacement with nine 16-inch (406 mm) guns, in size and appearance similar to the then under construction by the company.Ireland, p. 93 The U.S. firm of Gibbs & Cox provided four designs; one for a conventional battleship, and three hybrid designs which combined battleship main armament with a raised flight deck on the central superstructure capable of operating up to 30 aircraft.Ireland, pp. 92‚Äì93; Braynard, p. 66 While these projects proved useful to the Soviets, they decided to proceed with their own designs. The first Tactical-Technical Requirement (abbreviated in Russian as –¢–¢–ó) for the large battleship design was issued on 21 February 1936 but proved too ambitious, specifying nine 460 mm guns and a speed of on a displacement of 55,000 tons.Aside from the ship's specifications themselves the type of ton is not specified by McLaughlin. The TTZ was revised in May 1936 by Admiral Orlov, Commander of the Soviet Navy, reducing speed to , and weakening the secondary and anti-aircraft batteries. A few months later Admiral Orlov further reduced the size of the battleship to 45,000 tons and set the size of the main guns at 406 mm. Shortly afterward, the Soviet Union signed the Anglo-Soviet Quantitative Naval Agreement of 1937 and agreed to follow the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty that limited battleships to a displacement of 35,560 metric tons (35,000 long tons), although they did add a proviso that allowed them to build ships of unlimited size to face the Imperial Japanese Navy if they notified the British. Yet another TTZ was approved by Orlov on 3 August for ships of 41,500 tons with an armament of nine 406-millimeter, twelve , twelve , and forty guns, a maximum armor thickness of and a speed of 30 knots.McLaughlin, pp. 380‚Äì82 The design of KB-4, the surface ship design bureau of the Baltic Shipyard, was selected for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening of the deck armor that raised the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by Premier Stalin at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to begin again.McLaughlin, pp. 383‚Äì84 The timing of the redesign proved to be inauspicious as the Great Purge was spreading through the ranks of the military and related industries. The original deadline for completion of design work by 15 October was missed, and an incomplete version was presented to the navy's Shipbuilding Administration the next month. A number of details remained to be worked out, including the final design of the machinery plant, the 152 mm guns and the 100 mm gun mounts. In the meantime, extensive and expensive testing was conducted on the ship's hull form, deck armor and torpedo protection; 27 million rubles were spent on experimental work in 1938 alone. Over 100 models of the hull were tested in a ship model basin to find the best hull form and two one-tenth-scale launches were built at Sevastopol to test the hull's maneuverability. An old steamship was fitted with a replica of the design's armor decks and tested against bombs, proving that such ordnance would generally penetrate both the upper and middle decks before exploding on the armored deck. The main armor deck was raised one deck in consequence and a splinter deck added underneath it to stop any bomb or shell fragments that might penetrate the armor deck. The underwater protection system was tested on fifteen one-fifth scale models and two full-sized experimental barges. These tests proved that the torpedo belt system of multiple bulkheads was superior to the Pugliese system of a large tube filled with smaller sealed tubes, but it was too late to incorporate these test results into the design as construction was well underway by the time they were completed in late 1939.McLaughlin, pp. 384‚Äì85 A revised design was approved on 28 February 1938 and the first ship was to be laid down on 15 July, but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later. Trials with similarly shaped motor launches suggested that the hull's propulsive efficiency would be less than planned, and this was accepted in the November 1938 revision as a maximum speed of . However, a new propeller design proved to be more efficient and was predicted to increase speed to . Another change was the deletion of the centerline rudder when tests showed that the two wing rudders would not be able to counteract its effects if it jammed. The weight toward the stern of the boat was calculated to be too great, producing a substantial stern-down trim. To remedy this, the two 100 mm turrets mounted on the quarterdeck were deleted and the height of the armor belt abreast the rear turret was lowered, but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of the State Defense Committee on 14 January 1941. This forced a revision of the aircraft arrangements as the aircraft catapult had to be removed from the centerline of the quarterdeck; two catapults were added to the sides of the quarterdeck instead.McLaughlin, pp. 385‚Äì86, 389 =General characteristics= As designed, the Project 23-class ships, as Sovetsky Soyuz and her sisters were designated, were long overall. They had a beam of and at full load a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at full load, although weight estimates made in 1940 show that they would have exceeded standard and at full load.McLaughlin, pp. 379, 386 Luftwaffe aerial reconnaissance photo of the Ordzhinikidze Yard (Shipyard 189), Leningrad, showing the battleship Sovetsky Soyuz (top) and cruiser Chkalov under construction, 26 June 1941 The hull form was very full-bodied, especially at the forward magazines, where the torpedo protection system added width to the beam. Coupled with the relatively low length-to-beam ratio of 7.14:1, this meant that very powerful turbines were necessary to achieve even modest speeds. Stalin's decision that the Project 23-class ships would use three shafts instead of four increased the load on each shaft and reduced propulsive efficiency, although it did shorten the length of the armored citadel and thus overall displacement. Metacentric height was designed at and the tactical diameter was estimated at about .McLaughlin, p. 388 The Sovetsky Soyuz-class ships were provided with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle deck to house two of them and cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them out of the water.Gribovskii, p. 167 =Machinery= The machinery arrangement \\"provided good dispersal of the machinery spaces, but at the cost of very long runs for the wing shafts (ca. )\\". The turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room No. 1 and aft of the No. 2 turret magazines. The engine room for the center shaft's turbine was between boiler room No. 2 and No. 3. This meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers. The steam turbines, and a license to build them, were originally going to be ordered from Cammell Laird in the United Kingdom, but their ¬£700,000 cost was more than the Soviets wanted to pay. Instead they bought them from Brown Boveri, using the technical information acquired from Cammell Laird in the process, for ¬£400,000. Four single-reduction, impulse-reduction geared turbines were ordered from the Swiss firm, three to equip Sovetskaya Rossiya and one to serve as a pattern for the factory in Kharkov that was to build the remainder. The three produced a total of . Six triangle-type water-tube boilers‚Äîtwo in each boiler room‚Äîpowered the turbines at a working pressure of and a temperature of .McLaughlin, pp. 393‚Äì94 Maximum speed was estimated at 28 knots, using the revised propeller design, although forcing the machinery would yield an extra knot. The normal fuel oil capacity was , giving an estimated endurance of at and at full speed. Maximum fuel capacity was which gave a range of at 14.5 knots and at full speed.McLaughlin, p. 380 =Armament= 406 mm B-37 gun in MP-10 test mount, 1940 The main armament consisted of three electrically powered MK-1 triple turrets, each with three 50-caliber 406 mm B-37 guns. The guns could be depressed to ‚àí2¬∞ and elevated to 45¬∞. They had a fixed loading angle of 6¬∞ and their rate of fire varied with the time required to re-aim the guns. It ranged from 2.0 to 2.6 rounds per minute depending on the elevation. The turrets could elevate at a rate of 6.2 degrees per second and traverse at 4.55 degrees per second. 100 rounds per gun were carried. The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of . The secondary armament consisted of twelve 57-caliber B-38 152 mm guns mounted in six dual MK-4 turrets. Their elevation limits were ‚àí5¬∞ to +45¬∞ with a fixed loading angle of 8¬∞. Their rate of fire also varied with the elevation from 7.5 to 4.8 rounds per minute. They were provided with 170 rounds per gun.McLaughlin, pp. 379, 389 The turrets could elevate at a rate of 13 degrees per second and traverse at 6 degrees per second. They had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of . Heavy anti-aircraft (AA) fire was provided by a dozen 56-caliber 100 mm B-34 dual-purpose guns in six twin MZ-14 turrets with 400 rounds per gun. The ships began construction with only four turrets, but two additional turrets were restored to the quarterdeck in January 1941. They could elevate to a maximum of 85¬∞ and depress to ‚àí8¬∞. They could traverse at a rate of 12¬∞ per second and elevate at 10¬∞ per second. They fired high explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of against surface targets, but their maximum range against aerial targets was , the limit of their time fuse. Light AA defense was handled by ten quadruple, water-cooled, 46-K mounts fitted with 70-K guns with 1800 rounds per gun. Initially only eight mounts were planned when the ships began construction, but two more were added later, probably in January 1941, one on each side of the forward superstructure. Each mount was fully enclosed to protect the crew from the muzzle blast of the larger guns and against splinters. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Their effective anti-aircraft range was . =Fire control= Each main gun turret was given a DM-12 rangefinder for use in local control, but they were generally controlled by one of three KDP-8 fire-control directors. These had two stereoscopic rangefinders, one to track the target and the other to measure the range to the ship's own shell splashes. Two of these were protected by of armor and were mounted atop the rear superstructure and the tower-mast. The other was mounted on top of the conning tower and was protected by of armor. They used a TsAS-0 mechanical computer to generate firing solutions. Four KDP-4t-II directors, with two rangefinders each, controlled the secondary armament. One pair was on either side of the tower-mast and the aft pair was on each side of the aft funnel. Three SPN-300 stabilized directors, each with a 4-meter rangefinder, controlled the heavy anti-aircraft guns. There was one on each side of the forward funnel while the other was atop the rear superstructure.McLaughlin, pp. 388‚Äì89 =Protection= Soviet armor plate plants proved incapable of producing plates of cemented armor thicker than which forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than with face- hardened ones with less resistance in November 1940. The plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder, but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests. This would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the Sovetsky Soyuz- class ships in combat.McLaughlin, pp. 387, 390 The Sovetsky Soyuz-class ships devoted a total weight of to armor protection, a slightly greater weight than that of the larger Japanese Yamato class (). Their armor was intended to resist 406 mm shells and 500 kg bombs, specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35¬∞ and 50¬∞ from the centerline. This led to the very unusual situation where the armor belt thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines, which had to be compensated for by thicker armor. The belt was long and covered 57% of the total waterline length. It was inclined 5¬∞ to increase its resistance to flat-trajectory shells. Over the machinery spaces it was thick and increased in steps until it was thick over the forward magazines. It was over the rear magazine. The belt armor was carried forward of the magazines at a thickness of and terminated in a steeply sloped (30¬∞) transverse bulkhead that reduced to at the lower deck where it was continued down to the inner bottom by a bulkhead. Forward of this bulkhead was a 20 mm splinter belt that continued all the way to the bow. The main armor belt dropped down to the main deck from the upper deck abreast the aft turret to reduce weight. This \\"step\\" was protected by plates. A transverse bulkhead separated the rear turret and the ship's sides. The main part of the armored citadel was closed off by a 230 mm forward bulkhead and a rear bulkhead, both of homogeneous armor. Splinter armor thick covered the upper portion of the citadel.McLaughlin, pp. 190‚Äì92 The forecastle deck was 25 mm thick while the upper deck was over the citadel. Below it, the 50 mm middle deck acted as a splinter deck. The upper deck was 100 mm thick above the 220 mm waterline belt extension. The bottom edge of the forward splinter belt met with a arched deck. Another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead.McLaughlin, pp. 392‚Äì93 The main gun turrets had faces thick with sides and roofs thick. thick plates protected the gun ports and bulkheads separated each gun. The barbettes were thick above the upper deck. The MK-4 turrets had 100 mm faces and 65 mm sides. Their barbettes were 100 mm in thickness, but reduced to 65 mm on their inboard sides. 100 mm of armor protected the faces, sides and backs of the MZ-14 turrets for the 100 mm guns, but their roofs and barbettes were 100 mm thick. The forward conning tower had walls 425 mm thick while the rear conning tower had only . The flag bridge in the tower-mast had of protection. The torpedo defense system was designed to withstand torpedoes with warheads equivalent to of TNT. The ships were intended to be able to remain afloat with any five adjacent compartments flooded or with three torpedo hits and the destruction of the unarmored above- water side. The Pugliese system protected of the ships' midsection. At the aft end was a multi-bulkhead protection system that extended another to the rear from the Pugliese system. The depth of the system was amidships, but it reduced to fore and aft. The outer plating ranged from in thickness while the inner bottom was thick. The cylinder of the Pugliese system was also 7 mm thick while the semi-circular main bulkhead was thick with a flat bulkhead behind it. The diameter cylinder was intended to be immersed in fuel oil or water.McLaughlin, p. 393 Construction The August 1938 shipbuilding plan envisioned a total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced the Soviets to reassess their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority should be given to only one of the three remaining battleships.Rohwer and Monakov, pp. 95, 120 The Soviet shipbuilding and related industries proved to be incapable of supporting the construction of so many large ships at the same time. The largest warships built in the Soviet Union prior to 1938 were the s, and even they had suffered from a number of production problems, but the Soviet leadership appeared to ignore the difficulties encountered in the construction of the Kirov class when ordering 14 much more ambitious ships. Construction of two more ships planned for Leningrad and Nikolayev had to move to the brand-new Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk because the existing shipyards could not be expanded to handle so many large ships. Components for these two ships had to be manufactured at Leningrad and shipped via the White Sea ‚Äì Baltic Canal to Molotovsk. Also, the turret shop at Nikolaev proved to be too poorly equipped to assemble the 406 mm mountings and the propeller shafts had to be ordered in 1940 from Germany and the Netherlands as the domestic plants were already overburdened with orders. Shipbuilding steel proved to be in short supply in 1940, and a number of batches were rejected because they did not meet specifications. Armor plate production was even more problematic as only of the anticipated were delivered in 1939, and more than half of that was rejected. Furthermore, the armor plants proved to be incapable of making cemented plates over 230 mm, and inferior face-hardened plates had to substitute for all thicknesses over 200 mm.McLaughlin, pp. 386‚Äì87 Machinery problems were likely to delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943‚Äì1944. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler was supposed to have been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.McLaughlin, p. 387 Construction of all three ships was ordered halted on 10 July 1941, and Sovetsky Soyuz was placed into long-term conservation as the most advanced ship. However, all three were officially stricken from the Navy List on 10 September 1941. =Sovetsky Soyuz= German reconnaissance picture of Sovetsky Soyuz taken in June 1942 Sovetsky Soyuz (‚ÄìSoviet Union) was formally laid down 15 July 1938 in Shipyard Nr. 189 (Ordzhonikidze) in Leningrad, although evidence suggests that construction actually began in January 1939 after her slipway was completed, the necessary cranes were in place, and working drawings had been completed.Gribovskii, p. 166 When the war began she was estimated to be 21.19% complete, with of steel assembled on the slip. She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments, and, as some material had been used during the Siege of Leningrad, she was estimated to be 19.5% complete after the end of the war. Some thought was given to completing her, but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war. Stalin's expressed desire to see one of the Project 23-class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949.McLaughlin, pp. 411‚Äì13 =Sovetskaya Ukraina= Sovetskaya Ukraina (‚ÄìSoviet Ukraine) was laid down 31 October 1938 at Shipyard Nr. 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. When the war began she was 17.98% complete, with assembled on the slipway. Some effort was made to launch the hull, but little work had been done to dredge the river at the foot of the slipway, and she was captured on 18 August 1941, although retreating Soviet troops slightly damaged her hull. The Germans dismantled of her bow and of her stern for use in fortifications. They were forced to evacuate Nikolayev on 17 March 1944 and demolished the supporting blocks under her port side before they left, which gave her a list between 5 and 10 degrees and made her a total loss. She was ordered scrapped on 27 March 1947.McLaughlin, pp. 379, 411, 413 =Sovetskaya Rossiya= Sovetskaya Rossiya (‚ÄìSoviet Russia) was laid down on 22 July 1940 in Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk. After the end of the war she was only 0.97% complete, with of steel assembled. She was ordered scrapped on 27 March 1947. =Sovetskaya Belorussiya= Sovetskaya Belorussiya (‚ÄìSoviet Belorussia) was laid down 21 December 1939 at Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk, but construction was suspended in mid-1940 when it was discovered that 70,000 rivets used in her hull plating were of inferior quality. This fact probably influenced the decision to cancel her on 19 October 1940.McLaughlin, pp. 379, 387 Material intended for her construction was used to construct a floating battery for the defense of Leningrad.Ireland, p. 94 Notes References Bibliography  See also * K-1000 battleship, a purported class of Soviet battleships to succeed Sovetsky Soyuz, promulgated hoax of the Soviet government.

It was formed in November 2005 by Darius J. Pearce, Daren O'Toole and Gino Risoli. The original aim of Progress Jersey was to encourage electoral participation however it soon became a regular contributor to the Scrutiny process and has lobbied primarily on issues relating to compliance with the European Convention of Human Rights. Its active membership is chiefly drawn from the members of the Municipality of the Parish of Saint Helier. Organisation At the first annual meeting the members renewed their commitment to avoid adopting a formal structure and organisations and decisions are made by majority vote of members attending each meeting. Four authorised spokespersons were appointed at this time. In January 2007 it was recognised that a more formal approach had to be taken and they would organise as a charity. In May 2007, Darius J Pearce announced that should he stand at the next election it would be as a member of the Jersey Conservative Party and resigned from the board to ensure complete separation of the personnel of the charity and the political party. Progress Jersey has been active in online political discussion.  Activities  Progress Jersey commenced production of a quarterly newsletter for the Parish of St Helier called Parish Matters in Quarter One of 2007 and undertakes 'independent of government' surveys of political opinion amongst Jersey residents. Legislative successes =Abuse of trust= As the States of Jersey considered reform of the age of consent, Progress Jersey spearheaded the campaign to introduce greater safeguards for children before any changes were made. The proposition was withdrawn at the first attempt following an e-mail circulated to States Members on the eve of the debate by and a revised law with Abuse of Trust provisions was submitted subsequently and accepted. =Civil partnerships= Progress Jersey spearheaded the campaign to introduce homosexual civil partnerships in Jersey. Originally a submission was made to Jersey Scrutiny which was passed to the Legislation Committee. In 2006 Senator Philip Ozouf announced his support for the petition organized by Progress Jersey. In May 2011 the legislation was passed. =Reform of Jersey Legitimacy Laws= Progress Jersey made a submission to Jersey Scrutiny highlighting the inconsistency of the Legitimacy (Jersey) Law 1973, as amended with the position of Jersey as a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights. The proposition was accepted by Scrutiny in June 2006 and the matter referred to the Legislation Committee. In January 2007, following the introduction of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000 a case was brought before the Royal Court by a local lawyer who claimed that her illegitimate child was being discriminated against as he could not take the name of his father and that recording his fatherhood was not allowed.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 5 August 2018 Paphnutius was present at the First Ecumenical Council, which took up the subject of clerical celibacy. It seems that most of the bishops present were disposed to follow the precedent of the Council of Elvira prohibiting conjugal relations to those bishops, priests, deacons, and sub-deacons who were married before ordination. Paphnutius, so certain ancient authors tell us, earnestly entreated his fellow-bishops not to impose this obligation on the orders of the clergy concerned. He proposed, in accordance \\"with the ancient tradition of the Church\\", that only those who were celibates at the time of ordination should continue to observe continence, but, on the other hand, that \\"none should be separated from her, to whom, while yet unordained, he had been united\\". The great veneration in which he was held, and the well-known fact that he had himself observed the strictest chastity all his life, gave weight to his proposal, which was later unanimously adopted. The council left it to the discretion of the married clergy to continue or discontinue their marital relations. In addition, Paphnutius was a zealous defender of orthodoxy in the face of the Arian heresy.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúPaphnutius‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 24 July 2016. Web. 5 August 2018 Paphnutius, Potomon of Heraclea, and 47 other Egyptian bishops accompanied Saint Athanasius to the First Synod of Tyre in 335 A.D. Most Christians celebrate his feast on September 11. Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on April 19. Historicity The very existence of Paphnutius is contested by the historian Friedrich Winkelmann, because he is never mentioned by Athanasius, who also battled against Arianism.Friedrich Winkelmann: 'Paphnutios, der Bekenner und Bischof.' In: P. Nagel (Hg.): Probleme der koptischen Literatur. Halle 1968, p. 145-153. And idem: 'Die Problematik der Entstehung der Paphnutioslegende.' In: J. Herrmann: Griechenland - Byzanz - Europa. Berlin 1985, p. 32-42 - (Berliner Byzantinische Arbeiten; 52). Also, the Church History of Socrates Scholasticus, our earliest source on Paphnutius, is one of the very few references for him in general. His participation in the First Ecumenical Council was disputed several times, among others by such a respected canon law historian as Alfons Maria Cardinal Stickler.Alfons Maria Cardinal Stickler: The Case for Clerical Celibacy. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1995. Stickler's objection is that Paphutius' presence at the council was never mentioned by the council's historian Eusebius of Caesarea, and he also disproves Socrates' statement that he personally spoke to a participant of the council as Socrates was supposedly born too late to know personally anyone who had taken part in it. Stickler's main argument against Paphnutius' story is that the Synod of Trullo (691) failed to mention the Paphnutius story when they allowed matrimony for priests, which was done, as Stickler claims, under the emperor's pressure. The Council of Trullo, rather erroneously, referred only to the decrees of the Council of Carthage. However, Eusebius does not mention many things that certainly did happen, we are not sure when Socrates of Constantinople was born, and the Council of Trullo might have invoked several other canons from the past, though it did not. On the other hand, there have also been several prominent scholars who defended the veracity of the Paphnutius story. The main arguments were laid down by Karl Josef von Hefele in his Conciliengeschichte (1855),Karl Josef von Hefele (Bishop of Rottenburg): Conciliengeschichte. 7 vols. Freiburg, 1855-74. English translation: History of the Councils of the Church, 7 vols, 1871-1882. and were taken up by his successor at the T√ºbingen Catholic faculty of theology Franz Xaver von Funk, as well as by some other eminent historians as Elph√®ge Vacandard in the article on celibacy in the prestigious Dictionnaire de th√©ologie catholique (1905) and Henri Leclercq in an article in the Histoire des conciles (1908). Vacandard's position found wide acceptance among the scholars. The original argument by Hefele is available below.Conciliengeschichte, 1855, vol. I, pp.436 ff. \\"If this account [the Paphnutius story] be true, we must conclude that a law was proposed to the Council of Nicaea the same as one which had been carried twenty years previously at Elvira, in Spain; this coincidence would lead us to believe that it was the Spaniard Hosius who proposed the law respecting celibacy at Nicaea. The discourse ascribed to Paphnutius, and the consequent decision of the Synod, agree very well with the text of the Apostolic Constitutions, and with the whole practice of the Greek Church in respect to celibacy. The Greek Church as well as the Latin accepted the principle, that whoever had taken holy orders before marriage, ought not to be married afterwards. In the Latin Church, bishops, priests, deacons, and even subdeacons, were considered to be subject to this law, because the latter were at a very early period reckoned among the higher servants of the Church, which was not the case in the Greek Church. The Greek Church went so far as to allow deacons to marry after their ordination, if previously to it they had expressly obtained from their bishop permission to do so. The Council of Ancyra affirms this (c. 10). We see that the Greek Church wishes to leave the bishop free to decide the matter; but in reference to priests, it also prohibited them from marrying after their ordination. Therefore, whilst the Latin Church exacted of those presenting themselves for ordination, even as subdeacons, that they should not continue to live with their wives if they were married, the Greek Church gave no such prohibition; but if the wife of an ordained clergyman died, the Greek Church allowed no second marriage. The Apostolic Constitutions decided this point in the same way. To leave their wives from a pretext of piety was also forbidden to Greek priests; and the Synod of Gangra (c. 4) took up the defence of married priests against the Eustathians. Eustathius, however, was not alone among the Greeks in opposing the marriage of all clerics, and in desiring to introduce into the Greek Church the Latin discipline on this point. St. Epiphanius also inclined towards this side. The Greek Church did not, however, adopt this rigour in reference to priests, deacons, and subdeacons, but by degrees it came to be required of bishops and of the higher order of clergy in general, that they should live in celibacy. Yet this was not until after the compilation of the Apostolic Canons (c. 5) and of the Constitutions; for in those documents mention is made of bishops living in wedlock, and Church history shows that there were married bishops, for instance Synesius, in the fifth century. But it is fair to remark, even as to Synesius, that he made it an express condition of his acceptation, on his election to the episcopate, that he might continue to live the married life. Thomassin believes that Synesius did not seriously require this condition, and only spoke thus for the sake of escaping the episcopal office; which would seem to imply that in his time Greek bishops had already begun to live in celibacy. At the Trullan Synod (c. 13.) the Greek Church finally settled the question of the marriage of priests. Baronius, Valesius, and other historians, have considered the account of the part taken by Paphnutius to be apocryphal. ...But Baronius is mistaken in seeing a law upon celibacy in that third canon; he thought it to be so, because, when mentioning the women who might live in the clergyman's house-- his mother, sister, etc.--the canon does not say a word about the wife. ... Natalis Alexander gives this anecdote about Paphnutius in full: he desired to refute Bellarmin, who considered it to be untrue and an invention of Socrates to please the Novatians. ...Moreover, if it may be said that Socrates had a partial sympathy with the Novatians, he certainly cannot be considered as belonging to them, still less can he be accused of falsifying history in their favour. He may sometimes have propounded erroneous opinions, but there is a great difference between that and the invention of a whole story. Rufinus ...expressly says that Bishop Paphnutius was present at the Council of Nicaea. ...Lupus and Phillips explained the words of Paphnutius in another sense. According to them, the Egyptian bishop was not speaking in a general way; he simply desired that the contemplated law should not include the subdeacons. But this explanation does not agree with the extracts quoted from Socrates, Sozomen, and Gelasius, who believe Paphnutius intended deacons and priests as well.\\" Alban Butler says, \\"On account of the silence of other writers, and on the testimonies of Saint Jerome, Saint Epiphanius, and others, Bellarmin and Orsi suspect that Socrates and Sozomen were misinformed in this story. There is, however, nothing repugnant in the narration; for it might seem unadvisable to make too severe a law at that time against some married men, who, in certain obscure churches, might have been ordained without such a condition.\\" Notes References Saints from Roman Egypt 4th-century Christian saints ","title":"Paphnutius of Thebes"},{"id":"4976738","text":"Gare de Brest is the railway station serving Brest, France.

He also served as administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt from 1566 and of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden between 1582 and 1585.  Life  Henry Julius was born in Hessen am Fallstein as the eldest son of Duke Julius of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1528‚Äì1589) and his wife Hedwig of Brandenburg (1540‚Äì1602), at the time when the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel was still under the rule of his grandfather Duke Henry V. Already in 1566, at the age of two, he was elected Lutheran administrator of the Halberstadt bishopric by the cathedral chapter; however, a condition of his election was an agreement that the cathedral chapter would lead the prince-bishopric under its own authority until Henry Julius reached the age of 14. His father implemented the Protestant Reformation in the Wolfenb√ºttel lands upon his accession in 1568. In 1576 he appointed Henry Julius first rector of the newly established Protestant University of Helmstedt. Even though he was only twelve years old, Henry Julius participated in theological debates among the faculty that were held in Latin. After finishing his study in law, he was employed by his father as a court judge. When he came of age, he was rated one of the most educated princes of his time. Henry Julius actually took over administration of the Halbertstadt prince-bishopric in 1578, he became active as a temporal as well as spiritual ruler. He improved general education in the episcopal lands, and completed the implementation of the Protestant Reformation begun by his father, although he allowed Catholic office holders to keep their privileges ‚Äî except that he strictly prohibited priests from having mistresses. In view of his moderate policies, he also was offered the position of an administrator of the Minden prince-bishopric and was elected by the cathedral chapter in 1582. Nevertheless, expectations were disappointed, when Henry Julius ordered that all sermons ought to be preached according to the Augsburg Confession. When he resigned from office three years later, to marry the Wettin princess Dorothea of Saxony, he left a virtual Lutheran diocese. Juleum Novum, Helmstedt In 1589, when Henry Julius succeeded his father as ruler of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, he replaced Saxon by Roman Law, and instead of local nobles, lawyers with academic degrees now served as judges. He was also versed in architecture and began to rebuild his Wolfenb√ºttel residence in a lavish Weser Renaissance style, including the construction of the Protestant Beatae Mariae Virginis main church which started in 1608. He also had had extended baracks, walls and fortifications laid out around the city. He invited Hans Vredeman de Vries to develop ramparts and had a canal built through a swampland between Hornburg and Oschersleben. One of the most important buildings erected under his rule was the Juleum Novum, the main lecture hall of the Helmstedt university. However, he lost control of the state's finances and amassed large amounts of public debt. When the rights of the nobles were reduced, the local nobles sued Henry Julius at the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Court) in Speyer. A compromise was struck in 1601. Though a Protestant prince, Henry Julius became a close advisor to the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II. From 1600 onwards he stayed at the emperor's court at Prague Castle several times. He gained Rudolf's confidence, and was named Geheimrat and his \\"chief director\\" in 1607. This position gave him much influence in Imperial affairs. He also managed to resolve the conflict between Rudolf and his brother, Matthias and assisted in temporarily resolving the differences between Catholic and Protestant estates in the Kingdom of Bohemia. A serious conflict occurred between Henry Julius and the Brunswick citizens, when they refused to recognize his overlordship. Henry Julius was not willing to confirm the city's traditional privileges and had mercenary (Landsknecht) troops deployed, leading to a civil war in 1605. Attempts by King Christian IV of Denmark to mediate failed and in 1606, Emperor Rudolf II banned the city. In 1607, Henry Julius again went to the emperor's court, in order to negotiate the details of the ban. In return, he was given the emperor's full support in dealing with the Brunswick insurgents. Nevertheless, all attacks on the city failed. Under the rule of Henry Julius, the persecution of Jews and witches reached a historic peak. On the other hand, the duke was a dedicated follower of theatre and acting. In the years 1593 and 1594, he wrote eleven plays and invited Robert Browne, Thomas Sackville and their theatre company, who staged a shortened version of his \\"Susanna\\" for several years. His other plays, five comedies, four tragedies, were not very successful; however, one was a basis for the tall tales of Baron Munchausen. Duke Henry Julius also invited John Dowland to come and see Michael Praetorius, his Kapellmeister, playing on the famous Gr√∂ningen organ. When Emperor Rudolf died in 1612, Duke Henry Julius returned to the Prague court to consult his successor, Matthias. On 20 July 1613 he died in Prague, possibly of alcohol abuse. He was buried in the Marienkirche at Wolfenb√ºttel.

It is a member of the P-type ATPases, also known as E1-E2 ATPases due to its two states.  Biological function and location  The gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase or H+/K+ ATPase is the proton pump of the stomach. It exchanges potassium from the intestinal lumen with cytoplasmic hydronium and is the enzyme primarily responsible for the acidification of the stomach contents and the activation of the digestive enzyme pepsin (see gastric acid). The H+/K+ ATPase is found in parietal cells, which are highly specialized epithelial cells located in the inner cell lining of the stomach called the gastric mucosa. Parietal cells possess an extensive secretory membrane system and the H+/K+ ATPase is the major protein constituent of these membranes. A small amount of H+/K+ ATPase is also found in the renal medulla.  Genes and protein structure  The H+/K+ ATPase is a heterodimeric protein, the product of 2 genes. The gene ATP4AATP4A ATPase H+/K+ transporting alpha subunit encodes the H+/K+ ATPase Œ± subunit, and is an ~1000-amino acid protein that contains the catalytic sites of the enzyme and forms the pore through the cell membrane that allows the transport of ions. Hydronium ions bind to two active sites present in the Œ± subunit. The Œ± subunit also has a phosphorylation site (Asp385). The gene ATP4BATP4B ATPase H+/K+ transporting beta subunit encodes the Œ≤ subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase, which is an ~300-amino acid protein with a 36-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a highly glycosylated extracellular domain. Structure of the hydrogen potassium ATPase. The Œ± subunit is shown in pink; the Œ≤ subunit is shown in blue. The H+/K+ ATPase Œ≤ subunit stabilizes the H+/K+ ATPase Œ± subunit and is required for function of the enzyme. The Œ≤ subunit prevents the pump from running in reverse, and it also appears to contain signals that direct the heterodimer to membrane destinations within the cell, although some of these signals are subordinate to signals found in H+/K+ ATPase Œ± subunit. The structure of H+/K+ ATPase has been determined for humans, dogs, hogs, rats, and rabbits and is 98% homologous across all species.  Enzyme mechanism and activity  H+/K+ ATPase is a P2-type ATPase, a member of the eukaryotic class of P-type ATPases. Like the Ca2+ and the Na+/K+ ATPases, the H+/K+ ATPase functions as an Œ±, Œ≤ protomer. Unlike other eukaryotic ATPases, the H+/K+ ATPase is electroneutral, transporting one proton into the stomach lumen per potassium retrieved from the gastric lumen. As an ion pump the H+/K+ ATPase is able to transport ions against a concentration gradient using energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. Like all P-type ATPases, a phosphate group is transferred from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the H+/K+ ATPase during the transport cycle. This phosphate transfer powers a conformational change in the enzyme that helps drive ion transport. The hydrogen potassium ATPase is activated indirectly by gastrin that causes ECL cells to release histamine. The histamine binds to H2 receptors on the parietal cell, activating a cAMP- dependent pathway which causes the enzyme to move from the cytoplasmic tubular membranes to deeply folded canaliculi of the stimulated parietal cell. Once localized, the enzyme alternates between two conformations, E1 and E2, to transport ions across the membrane. Mechanism of the H+/K+ ATPase demonstrating how E1-E2 conformational change corresponds to ion release. See Shin et al. The E1 conformation binds a phosphate from ATP and hydronium ion on the cytoplasmic side. The enzyme then changes to the E2 conformation, allowing hydronium to be released in the lumen. The E2 conformation binds potassium, and reverts to the E1 conformation to release phosphate and K+ into the cytoplasm where another ATP can be hydrolyzed to repeat the cycle. The Œ≤ subunit prevents the E2-P conformation from reverting to the E1-P conformation, making proton pumping unidirectional. The number of ions transported per ATP varies from 2H+/2K+ to 1H+/1K+depending on the pH of the stomach.  Disease relevance and inhibition  Inhibiting the hydrogen potassium pump to decrease stomach acidity has been the most common method of treating diseases including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Reducing acidity alleviates disease symptoms but does not treat the actual cause of GERD (abnormal relaxation of the esophageal sphincter) or PUD (Helicobacter pylori and NSAIDs). Three drug classes have been used to inhibit H+/K+ ATPases. H2-receptor antagonists, like cimetidine (Tagamet), inhibit the signaling pathway that leads to activation of the ATPase. This type of inhibitor is effective in treating ulcers but does not prevent them from forming, and patients develop tolerance to them after about one week, leading to a 50% reduction in efficacy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were later developed, starting with Timoprazole in 1975. PPIs are acid- activated prodrugs that inhibit the hydrogen-potassium ATPase by binding covalently to active pumps. Current PPIs like Omeprazole have a short half- life of approximately 90 minutes. Acid pump antagonists (APAs) or potassium- competitive acid blockers (PCABs) are a third type of inhibitor that blocks acid secretion by binding to the K+ active site. APAs provide faster inhibition than PPIs since they do not require acid activation. Revaprazan was the first APA used clinically in east Asia, and other APAs are being developed since they appear to provide better acid control in clinical trials. Inactivation of the proton pump can also lead to health problems. A study in mice by Krieg et al. found that a mutation of the pump‚Äôs Œ±-subunit led to achlorhydria, resulting in problems with iron absorption, leading to iron deficiency and anemia. The use of PPIs has not been correlated with an elevated risk of anemia, so the H+/K+ ATPase is thought to aid iron absorption but is not necessarily required. Current association of dementia and PPIs have been documented in Germany and in research articles denoting how Benzimidazole derivatives, Astemizole (AST) and Lansoprazole (LNS) interact with anomalous aggregates of tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles). Epub 2014 Jun 16. Current theories include the non-selective blockade of sodium-potassium pumps in the brain causing osmotic imbalances or swelling in the cells. [auth opinion] Interaction of PPIs with other drug affecting the sodium-potassium pump, e.g., digoxin, warfarin etc., has been well documented. Memory has been associated with astrocytes and the alpha3 subunit of adenosine receptor found in hydrogen/Sodium-potassium pumps may be a focal point in dementia.

He published seminal papers on protein structure and denaturation and debunked early models of protein structures, notably those of William Astbury. His research focused mainly on the proteases, (proteins that act as enzymes cleaving other proteins).Neurath, H., \\"Evolution of proteolytic enzymes\\", Science 1984, volume 224, 350-357. Neurath, H., \\"Proteolytic processing and physiological regulation\\", Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989, volume 14, 268-271. Writing and editing Neurath wrote more than 400 papers. He founded two journals of protein science: Biochemistry, which he edited from 1961 to 1991; and Protein Science, which he edited from 1991 to 1998. He also edited three volumes of \\"The Proteins,\\" a reference work. Work in Seattle Neurath founded the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle, and served as its chair from 1950 until 1975, when he retired. His department produced three winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: Edwin G. Krebs and Edmond H. Fischer, who stayed in Seattle; and Martin Rodbell, who earned his PhD in the department and went on to a distinguished career at the NIH. Neurath was also part-time scientific director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Personal life Neurath was married to Susi Spitzer Neurath for 41 years. He had a son, Peter F. Neurath, from an earlier marriage; two stepchildren, Margaret Albrecht and Frank Meyer; and three step-grandchildren. He died at the age of 92 on April 12, 2002 in Seattle.

It was written by Terence Winter and directed by Tim Van Patten, and originally aired on March 26, 2000. Starring * James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano * Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi * Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano * Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti * Dominic Chianese as Corrado Soprano, Jr. * Vincent Pastore as Pussy Bonpensiero * Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante * Tony Sirico as Paulie Gualtieri * Robert Iler as Anthony Soprano, Jr.Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Meadow SopranoDrea de Matteo as Adriana La Cerva David Proval as Richie Aprile * Aida Turturro as Janice Soprano * Nancy Marchand as Livia Soprano * = credited only =Guest starring= * Jerry Adler as Hesh Rabkin Also guest starring Synopsis Tony is advised by his lawyer, Neil Mink, to \\"insulate\\" himself from the \\"shenanigans\\" so he spends time at home, where he is bored, and in the office of Barone Sanitation, where he draws up an office basketball pool and has sex with the office assistant, but is still bored. Dr. Melfi is under heavy stress because of her relationship with Tony. She is drinking between sessions on the days that she sees him. Tony comments once, \\"You seem very mellow today. You look like you're on drugs.\\" In a restaurant with her son, she creates a scene when she tries to stop another patron from smoking. She tells Dr. Kupferberg that, although she is repulsed by what Tony tells her, \\"I can't stop myself from wanting to hear it.\\" Kupferberg prescribes medication, and urges her again to cease treating this patient. Junior and Richie are selling cocaine on their garbage routes. Tony angrily tells Richie to stop, saying that this can draw FBI and DEA attention to their legitimate business. Richie glares at him before turning away. After this confrontation, Tony has a panic attack. He almost has another when he sees Janice behaving lovingly with Richie, who is now her fianc√©. Thinking aloud, Tony says, \\"Oh, you poor bastard.\\" One of Junior's drivers continues selling cocaine; Junior says he needs the income for legal and medical expenses. At the hospital he is recognized by an old school friend, Catherine Romano, who is the widow‚Äîand also the mother‚Äîof a policeman. At first Junior evades her, ashamed of his illnesses and his house arrest. Eventually he phones her, and in his home she looks after him affectionately. Tony returns to Satriale's and his crew welcomes him back. Title reference House arrest is a sentence issued by a judge as an alternative to prison time and helps keep track of convicted criminals after, or as an alternative to, a prison sentence. The sentence states that the person cannot leave their main domicile and can only be released for important family functions, medical appointments, or funerals. Junior is also able to leave his residence when he needs to visit a supermarket. Junior's social life begins to dwindle under his sentence. The title also applies to the increased amount of time that Tony spends at home, surrounded by mundane activities that do not interest him. In this way, Tony experiences a sort of \\"house arrest\\", isolated from his friends and the work that he enjoys. Although Tony's sentence is more self-imposed than his uncle's, it has been advised by his lawyer. Cultural references *When Tony is reminded of the Bevilaqua murder case by his lawyer, he remarks \\"I told you, I was home alone\\". Mink replies \\"You and Macaulay Culkin\\", referring to the 1990 film Home Alone. *One of the nurses in the hospital laughs at the U.S. Marshal sent to affix an electronic bracelet to Junior's ankle when he mentions his last name is McLuhan. His professional name is therefore Marshal McLuhan, similar to the name of Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan. In his 1970 book From Cliche to Archetype McLuhan extensively analysed and discussed Eug√®ne Ionesco play The Bald Soprano. *Mary Louise Wilson's character Catherine Romano shares a name with Nanette Fabray's character on the sitcom One Day at a Time, which Wilson was also on from 1976‚Äì1977. *During a therapy session, Tony mentions he was watching a movie starring Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow. Dr. Melfi guesses \\"Sliding Doors\\" (which stars Paltrow but not Pitt). Tony corrects her with Seven. *While Junior is talking to Catherine, she mentions her husband died \\"almost 15 years ago, the week the shuttle exploded\\", referring to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. *At a meeting of Carmela's book club in her living room, her friends discuss the memoir Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt. McCourt's follow-up memoir, 'Tis, lies on a nearby table. *Tony sarcastically rebuts Junior's nostalgic view of 1950s gangsters working together to settle their differences amicably, mentioning his memories of the picture of Albert Anastasia \\"lying there all amicable, on the barber shop floor\\". He's referring to the 1957 assassination of the Mafia boss in the barber shop of Manhattan's Park Sheraton Hotel. *During a therapy session with Dr. Melfi, Tony, frustrated with his recent lack of progress, angrily mentions he's \\"ready for the George Sanders long walk\\", which refers to the 1972 suicide of actor George Sanders. *The television show Junior Soprano and Catherine Romano are watching when he falls asleep is Diagnosis: Murder, starring Dick Van Dyke. Music *The song at the beginning of the episode when the garbage truck dumps the pile of trash outside the deli is \\"Space Invader\\" by The Pretenders. *The song that plays early in the episode at the Soprano house over radio station Q104.3 is \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" by Bob Dylan. *Prior to Tony's panic attack at the banquet, the song playing is \\"Disco Inferno\\", by The Trammps. *The song that plays while Tony suffers his panic attack at the banquet is \\"More Than a Feeling\\" by Boston. The lyric \\"I closed my eyes and I slipped away\\" can be heard just before he passes out. *The song played over the end credits is \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory\\" by Johnny Thunders.

Plot Members of a college swim team take anabolic steroids to enhance their performance. While on a daytrip to a local lake, a couple of the members pick up some leeches, which feed on the steroids in their blood. The leeches end up washed down a shower drain, where they grow to enormous size and return for more feedings. Following the deaths of several members of the team and a college administrator, the few surviving team members and one of their girlfriends hatch a plan to kill off the monster leeches. They will draw them to the campus swimming pool by having one of the swimmers act as bait. Then they'll electrify the pool, electrocuting the leeches. Tragically, the team coach, who's been infected by a leech, attacks them, delaying the electrification just long enough to allow the leeches to kill one last swimmer. Finally the coach is subdued and the switch is thrown, frying the leeches. As the film ends, a surviving swim team member, in true mad scientist fashion, is revealed to have had a hand in creating the leeches and is shown to have breeding stock left.

The exhibition grounds were just over in size, with the main buildings accounting for around of this. Feature structures included: * the Centennial Tower, the main focus of attention, standing tall and weighing 700 tons. This icon featured on many of the souvenirs celebrating the exhibition. * a statue of a Neriad (a sea-woman on a seahorse) standing in the central fountain. * the New Zealand Railways Department stand featuring a working model-railway constructed to scale and maintained by Frank Roberts (model maker). 2,641,043 (2.6 million) visitors attended the exhibition. The last time an event of such a scale had been held was the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition in 1925‚Äì26, when 3.2 million visitors were counted at the exhibition in Dunedin. Anscombe had also been the architect for the Dunedin exhibition. Photography Kupe Statue at the Centennial Exhibition Roller coaster In February 1938 tenders were invited by the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition Company Ltd for official photographer for the Exhibition. The submission of Eileen Olive Deste (1908‚Äì1986) included a testimonial from John A. Lee, under-secretary for housing in the Labour government, for a housing-exhibition project in the Kirkcaldie and Stains gallery in 1937. Deste won the exclusive right to photograph exhibits or any other object in the exhibition buildings or grounds, with a percentage of the gross takings from the sale of the photographs going to the Exhibition Company. The photography rights covered all aspects of the exhibition, from construction to closing. Deste flew above the site in a small plane to take aerial shots, a terrifying but exciting experience, as she later remembered. Deste also entered into an agreement with Coulls Somerville Wilkie Limited to supply photographs for publications and general souvenir material, and her photographs illustrate their Pictorial souvenir of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, 1939‚Äì1940. Deste's stall in the General Exhibits Building sold photographs and postcards in black and white and colour. Much of the photography at the exhibition came from the camera of an employee, Neville d‚ÄôEresby (Des) Aickin, while Deste did the processing and printing at her studio. New Zealand Potters In 1939-1940 potters Olive Jones and Elizabeth Matheson demonstrated and sold work at the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition for six months. Post-exhibition war-time use Plans envisaged using the building only for six months and then dismantling it. But with New Zealand's ongoing participation in World War II (1939‚Äì1945), the New Zealand Air Force used the site and some buildings until the end of the war. In 1946 what remained was burnt to the ground.

Career Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, he attended local and private schools. He completed an apprenticeship as a printer, and then went into the newspaper business. Prentiss became foreman of the New York Evening Post before moving to Cooperstown, New York in October, 1808. He became the printer of The Impartial Observer, which had been founded by Judge William Cooper. In 1809, the paper's name was changed to The Cooperstown Federalist to reflect its political affiliation. When Cooper died Prentiss became the paper's owner and editor. In 1818, the name was changed to The Freeman's Journal dropping the Federalist label as Prentiss's shifted his political support to the Democratic-Republican Party. He operated the newspaper until his retirement in 1849. In addition to operating the newspaper, Prentiss served in the New York Militia, appointed by Governor DeWitt Clinton as inspector of the 16th Division with the rank of colonel. He was postmaster of Cooperstown from April 24, 1833 to February 17, 1837 and was vice president of the 1837 New York State Democratic convention in Albany. Prentiss was elected as the Twenty- fifth and Twenty-sixth Congresses as a Democrat, serving from March 4, 1837 to March 3, 1841. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1840 and returned to his newspaper, in addition serving as president of the Bank of Cooperstown. Death and burial Prentiss retired in 1849 and continued to reside in Cooperstown. He died there on June 26, 1861, and was buried at Cooperstown's Lakewood Cemetery. Family In 1815 Prentiss married Catherine Cox Morris (1795-1818), the daughter of General Jacob Morris and granddaughter of Lewis Morris. In 1828 he married Urilla Shankland (1799-1890). His children with his first wife included Mary Martha (1817-1854) and Catharine Lucretia (1817-1901). With his second wife his children included Alexander Shankland (1829-1854), John Holmes, Jr. (1832-1923), Rachel Ann (1834-1874), and Charlotte Darbyshire (1837-1935). John Holmes Prentiss' brother, Samuel Prentiss, was a U.S. Senator and United States District Court judge from Vermont. His nephew, Theodore Prentiss, was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

He served as the chairman of the board of management of the parent company, Volkswagen AG (formerly Volkswagenwerk AG). During his tenure, the group's car production increased from two million units in 1982 to 3.5 million a decade later.  Early life and education  Hahn was born in the German state of Saxony and raised near Chemnitz. His father had been a senior manager of the German car and motorcycle company DKW and was a co-founder of the Auto Union in 1932, which later evolved into the Audi car brand. As a college student, he studied business administration at the University of Cologne and the University of Zurich, economics and politics in Great Britain and France. In 1952, Hahn received his doctorate in Economics at the University of Berne in Switzerland. He went to Perugia for a year to study art history, intending to volunteer at Fiat.Carl H. Hahn Carl und Marisa Hahn-Stiftung, n.d. retrieved 25 July 2017 Career Before joining Volkswagen, he worked as an economist at the OECD in Paris in the der European Productivity Agency. In 1953 Hahn joined VW as an assistant of chairman Heinrich Nordhoff, and quickly became head of sales promotion in VW's export department. Hahn was a favorite of Nordhoff's. =Volkswagen of America, 1959‚Äì1965= In 1959, Nordhoff made him president of the company's U.S. subsidiary, Volkswagen of America.Under Hahn's leadership, Volkswagen of America began a national advertising campaign to attract more attention to its quirky Beetle sedan and Microbus wagon. Hahn soon hired the Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency, which created some of the most memorable car ads in history. Its print and television ads for the Volkswagen brand respected the customer's intelligence, gave detailed information about Volkswagen's products, and made fun of the unorthodox qualities of the cars. The ads became cultural icons as much as the cars did, and Volkswagen enjoyed phenomenal sales in the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s. Hahn became a beloved figure in the United States before his return to Germany in 1965, having been affectionately nicknamed \\"Mr. Volkswagen\\" by VW enthusiasts. While stationed in America, Hahn married Marisa Lea Traina (whose brother later married romance novelist Danielle Steel); their four children were all born in the U.S. =Chairman of Volkswagen AG,1982‚Äì1993= In 1973, Hahn left VW and returned to Hannover, Germany to lead the German tire company Continental AG. In 1982, he returned to become chairman of Volkswagenwerk AG. Under his leadership, Volkswagen entered a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car brand SEAT in 1982, bought a majority interest in 1986, and by 1990 owned the entire company. In 1985, Hahn was able to push VW's earnings up 140 percent to $225 million based on sales of more than $21 billion, and he was credited for pushing VW beyond the one-car strategy left over from the era of air-cooled Beetles and the early success of the Volkswagen Golf Mk1 in the 1970s. The second-generation edition, introduced in Europe in 1983 and in North America in 1984, was one of the bestselling cars of the 1980s worldwide. Two out of every three Volkswagen vehicles sold in 1985 were Golfs, and 97,128 second- generation Golfs were produced at Volkswagen's Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant in Pennsylvania that year. Despite Hahn's earlier success in leading Volkswagen of America, VW sales in the United States dropped during his tenure as VW chairman, from 171,281 units in 1982 to 75,873 in 1992, largely to due intense competition from American and Japanese carmakers. Soon after Hahn became chairman of VW, he tested an American Volkswagen Rabbit built at the Westmoreland plant, which had opened in 1978, and he was deeply disappointed in how the Rabbit had been changed. The car had been re- engineered to drive like an American family sedan, with softer suspension and shock absorbers. \\"When I drove the American Rabbit, it felt like a Chevrolet,\\" he complained. \\"If you want a Chevrolet, you should go to General Motors.\\" Hahn fired Volkswagen of America president James McLernon, a former Chevrolet engineer who had been tapped by VW to get the Westmoreland plant up and running. Hahn brought in new management and kept the Westmoreland factory open to produce the second-generation Golf as a hedge against currency fluctuation between the German mark (DM) and the U.S. dollar, but inefficient production and soft sales in North America caused VW to close the plant in 1988. After the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991 Volkswagen entered a joint venture with the Czech company ≈†koda Auto. Hahn's acquisitions made Volkswagen a global force, and affirmed its place as Europe's largest automaker. Hahn also cleaned up VW's business practices, dealing with a case of foreign exchange fraud, but its $300 million cost to Volkswagen ate into the very profits Hahn had helped the company make. Legacy Although Hahn was applauded for making the Volkswagen Golf the most popular car in Europe, and expanding the company through the SEAT and ≈†koda acquisitions, Volkswagen was in financial trouble by the end of his tenure as chairman, having lost 770 million marks in the eighties surge of the European car market, maintaining a low after-tax profit margin of 2.8 percent. Pre-tax profits went from three billion marks in 1989 to 1.785 billion marks just three years later. Hahn could not keep manufacturing and development costs under control. He was replaced as Volkswagen CEO by Ferdinand Pi√´ch in 1993. Former Volkswagen of America president Bill Young, in an interview with journalist David Kiley, explained Hahn's record as chairman of VW: \\"Dr. Hahn had a lot on his plate in the 1980s, and [VW was] an organization that he was not suited or equipped to turn upside down the way Piech did.\\" Automotive journalist David E. Davis offered a mixed review: \\"Hahn is a terrific man, and he did a lot of good things for Volkswagen, but he obviously lost interest in the American market by the time he came back in the 1980s based on the lack of attention the American division got.\\"  References   Further reading  *Hiott, Andrea, Thinking Small: The Long Strange Trip of the Volkswagen Beetle, 2013. *Keller, Marryann, Collision: GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and the Battle To Own the 21st Century, 1993. 1926 births Living people Volkswagen Group executives Businesspeople from Saxony People in the automobile industry Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Carl Hahn"},{"id":"4977127","text":"is a railway station in the city of Yokote, Akita Prefecture, Japan, operated by JR East.

In the name, \\"lead\\" (as in the heavy metal) refers to the heavy weight of the body, and \\"sled\\" refers to the lowering of the vehicle, giving these vehicles the appearance that they were \\"slip sliding\\" down the highway. Period auto body repair, by an auto body mechanic used to be achieved through a combination of re-shaping sheet metal using specialist hand tools and the application of molten lead to damaged body panels, fulfilling the role of more modern polyester fillers / bondo. The same techniques were also used in high end low volume car production (coachbuilding) and adopted for aftermarket hot rodding body panel modifications. Automotive usage In order to be classified as a ‚Äúlead sled‚Äù, the vehicle was subjected to most, if not all, of the following body style modifications: *Chopped: cutting off the roof, shortening the pillars, and re-welding the roof back onto the car body *Channeled: cutting the underside of the body to lower the entire body on the frame *Sectioned: cutting a horizontal piece cut out of the body lengthwise, to reduce the beltline height *Frenched: recessing headlights, tail lights, license plates, and radio antennae into the body for an exotic look. *Emblem removal: all original manufacturer's emblems were removed as these were considered to detract from the vehicle. The thought was \\"anything that produces a hiccup, a bulge or extrudes from the body is not aerodynamic and detracts from the smooth appearance of the vehicle.\\" The object of the builder is to make the body as smooth, sleek, and sexy as possible. *Dechromed: all factory trim was removed as these dressings detracted from the lines of the car. *Drip rail removal: rain drip rails were removed from the roof as they detracted from the smoothness of the vehicle. *Shaved: door handles and locks were removed, because they detracted from the smoothness of the vehicle. Electric solenoids and switches were installed in inconspicuous places, typically under the rocker panels or side mirrors, to provide alternate means for opening the doors. The entire process of removing badges, trim, and doorhandles was referred to as \\"shaving\\". Grill modifications: the original grill was heavily modified, or substituted with the grill from a completely different make, model, and year car. In the late 1940s and 1950s, plastic body filler and fiberglass did not exist. Instead, bar lead was used as a body filler. A true craftsman pulled and pushed out dents with body spoons, hammers and dollies until the sheet metal was as straight as they could get it. Any sheet metal that was still slightly wavy, the bodyman heated bars of lead and flowed the lead onto the body with an oxygen-acetylene torch similar to work done by a tin smith. The bars of lead were what we today call ‚Äúsolder‚Äù but were not the wire material we are familiar with today, typically sold for electrical or plumbing repairs. The lead bars or strips ranged anywhere from a quarter of an inch to one inch in width and several inches in length. Lead craftsman call the process of melting the lead ‚Äúrunning lead‚Äù and this is a highly specialized ancient trade passed from a master craftsman to an apprentice. An apprentice bodyman typically would remove the body part from the car and place it on a bench so as to have a fairly flat surface to flow the lead horizontally onto the body. In contrast, the master craftsman could control the heat of the lead in a vertical position without having to remove the body part, thereby saving time in performing the repair. An apprentice bodyman most likely would have to grind and hand file the lead to a smooth finish for repainting. The master craftsman on the other hand did not have to grind and only had to hand file, if he had to perform any smoothing at all. The true craftsman controlled the flow of lead with his torch and most times could produce a satin finish without filing. \\"Lead\\" refers to the body material used and the extra weight added by the repair material. \\"Sled\\" refers to the lowering of the vehicle, giving these vehicles the appearance that they were \\"slip sliding\\" down the highway. As time progressed, plastics such as \\"Bondo\\" were introduced to the market. These plastic body fillers are easier to work with and eventually replaced the use of lead in body repair. Some common late model lead sleds are the 1949 Mercury, 1949 Ford, and the 1959 Cadillac. Other usages Among aircraft nicknames, \\"lead sled\\" has also been used as a nickname for a variety of US military aircraft, including the F3H Demon, F-84 Thunderjet, F-105 Thunderchief, and SR-71 Blackbird. In particular these airplanes tend to be large, heavy or very fast. Despite this, the airplane's maneuverability is relatively poor. The F-105 gained this nickname during the Vietnam War. While the plane was fast in straight lines it was not very maneuverable, rendering it very vulnerable to enemy weapons. In shooting sports, \\"Lead Sled\\" is the registered trademark name of a device made by Caldwell Shooting Supplies. Roughly resembling a snow sled or toboggan, lead or cast iron weights can be added to increase stability. The user places the device on a bench or table, adds weight for stability, and uses the device's fixtures to secure a firearm in the \\"sled\\" for firing. The purpose of the device is to remove human error from the process of adjusting the firearm's sights or determining the accuracy of the firearm and reduce felt recoil to the shooter.

The murder set off a chain of events which led to the Baylor basketball scandal, in which the university's men's basketball program was investigated and punished for numerous infractions by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Background Patrick James Dennehy (January 28, 1982 ‚Äì June 12, 2003) was born in Santa Clara, California. Dennehy transferred to Baylor University from the University of New Mexico (UNM) following his sophomore season in 2001‚Äì2002. In the summer of 2003, after redshirting the 2002‚Äì2003 season, Dennehy was preparing to play for Baylor Bears men's basketball team in the upcoming 2003‚Äì2004 season. Carlton Dotson, a junior power forward on the team who was a friend of Dennehy's, attended North Dorchester High School in Hurlock, Maryland and Paris Junior College before transferring to Baylor in the summer of 2002, where he played one season. Murder In the summer of 2003, reports surfaced that Dennehy and Dotson were concerned about their safety. The pair had purchased two pistols and a rifle and practiced firing them at a farm north of Waco. Dennehy's friend, Daniel Okopnyi, said he spoke on the phone with Dennehy on June 14, and Dennehy said that he was worried about threats made to Dotson by two teammates. Dennehy also indicated that he and Dotson would be at a party the following day, at which neither appeared. Over the next few days, there were indications that something had gone wrong: Dennehy's mother and stepfather, Valorie and Brian Brabazon, were concerned that they had received no calls on Father's Day, and Dennehy's roommate, Chris Turk, returned from an out-of-town trip to find that Dennehy's dogs had not been fed in days. The last time that Dennehy had been seen was June 12. On June 19, the Brabazons filed a report with the Waco Police Department that Dennehy was missing. On June 25, Dennehy's Chevrolet Tahoe was found in the parking lot of a shopping mall in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with its license plates removed, allegedly by Dotson. An affidavit filed on June 23, which was unsealed on June 30, seeking a search warrant for Dennehy's computer says that an informant in Delaware told police that Dotson, who by now was at home in Maryland, told a cousin that he had shot and killed Dennehy during an argument while firing guns in the Waco area. On July 21, Dotson was charged with Dennehy's murder and taken into custody in Maryland. The search for Dennehy continued until July 25, when a badly decomposed body was found in a gravel pit near Waco and was taken to Dallas for an autopsy. While Dotson said he felt compelled to speak with the FBI, it is unknown whether his report led police to Dennehy's body. The following day, medical examiners identified the body as Dennehy's. On July 30, his death was ruled a homicide after a preliminary autopsy report showed that Dennehy died of gunshot wounds to the head. Upon discovery of Dennehy's remains, the head and body were discovered in separate locations. Whereas sensationalized news reports indicated Dennehy was decapitated, investigators believe this occurrence is most likely the result of scavenging desert animals. On August 7, a memorial service was held for Dennehy in San Jose, California. Court case On October 28, 2004, Dotson was declared incompetent to stand trial by District Judge George Allen and was sent to a state mental hospital to be reevaluated in four months' time. Three psychiatrists, including one appointed by the court, said that Dotson appeared to be suffering from hallucinations and psychosis, but that he could regain competency to stand trial in the future. Among other issues, Dotson believed people were trying to kill him because he was Jesus. It is believed that his ex-wife also noticed he was hearing voices. In February 2005, Dotson was returned to jail after psychologists deemed him competent to stand trial but that he must continue taking his anti-psychotic medication. The psychologist also said that Dotson's accounts of hallucinations and hearing voices were \\"suspect.\\" On June 8, 2005, five days before his trial for murder was to begin, Dotson unexpectedly pleaded guilty to killing Patrick Dennehy. On June 15, Dotson was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole after he has served about half of his sentence, in 2021. In December 2005, Dotson wrote a letter seeking permission to appeal his case; in January 2006, a judge ruled that Dotson had forfeited his right to appeal when he pleaded guilty.

Sloan Jr., made a speech to the public where he described the discovery as having the community's \\"worst fears being realized\\" and that it was a heart-wrenching loss. He along with many other representatives from Baylor attended Dennehy's funeral. Baylor University also held a campus-wide memorial for Dennehy on August 28, 2003, in the Paul W. Powell Chapel. There was a charity event held by Bill Cosby on September 4, 2003, at the Floyd Casey Stadium where he mentioned Dennehy when discussing people that had been lost throughout the year.

It is pegged at par with the South African rand. The name, recalling that of the town where it circulates, derives from Latin aurum, meaning \\"gold\\". The currency is not sanctioned by the South African Reserve Bank. History The first notes were issued in April 2004 to provide an internal currency for Orania as part of its quest for self-determination. The idea of the Ora originated in 2002, when Professor Johan van Zyl argued that a community that intended to empower itself should have access to as many instruments as possible, including its own currency. It is printed in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 Ora. The 10 Ora note depicts Afrikaner history, the 20 Ora note Afrikaner art; the 50 Ora note Afrikaner culture; and the 100 Ora note Orania itself. Each note also advertises a local business. Other than in Orania itself, the currency is also accepted in some surrounding towns. To encourage its use, some stores in Orania offer a 5% discount for items purchased in Ora. The local banking institution, the Orania Spaar- en Kredietko√∂peratief, is in charge of the initiative. The use of the Ora as a payment method also has the effect of discouraging theft, as it can only be used within Orania. About R400,000 to R580,000 worth of Oras were in circulation by 2011.

There are multiple types of cross-sex friendships, all defined by whether or not each party has a romantic attraction to each other, or perceives that the other is interested. A few theories have been developed to explain the existence of such friendships. Research has been done on why men and women initiate these relationships, how they are perceived by others, implications for children with cross-sex friendships, among others. Cross-sex friendships can also create problems for those involved if either or both have or ever had any romantic feelings for the other. Background Cross-sex friendships play a large role in social relations of both men and women. They can be a cause of complications because of the potential for romance or sexual interactions. Monsour (2002) defines a cross-sex friendship as a ‚Äúvoluntary, non-familial, non-romantic, relationship between a female and a male in which both individuals label their association as a friendship‚Äù. However, just because these friendships are labeled as ‚Äúnon-romantic,‚Äù one cannot assume that there are no romantic or sexual undertones. Guerrero and Chavez (2005) suggest that there are four types of cross-sex friendships: mutual romance, strictly platonic, desires romance, and rejects romance. In a ‚Äúmutual romance‚Äù cross-sex friendship, one of the participants wants a romantic relationship with the other individual and believes that the other individual wants the same. In ‚Äústrictly platonic‚Äù relationships, the individual believes that the other simply wants to be just platonic friends with no thought of romance. In a \\"desires romance\\" cross-sex friendship, one individual wants the friendship to become a romantic relationship but does not believe the other individual wants a romantic relationship. In a ‚Äúrejects romance‚Äù cross-sex relationship, one individual does not want the relationship to turn romantic, but believes that their friend does. Each of these friendship styles are based on the goals and viewpoint of the individual. Other theories and research discuss the causes and benefits of cross-sex friendships. Major theories =Evolutionary theory= Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) theorize that cross-sex friendships are a part of humans‚Äô evolved mating strategies. Current mating strategies unconsciously motivate individuals to enter into cross-sex friendships because it gives them more opportunities to mate. As a result, individuals within these cross-sex friendships often develop attraction to the other individual, even when that attraction is completely unintended.Bleske- Rechek, April et al. \\"Benefit or Burden? Attraction in cross-sex Friendship\\", \\"Journal of Social and Personal Relationships\\", 2012. This evolutionary theory predicts that cross-sex friendships are formed by males for sexual access and by females for protection.Bleske-Rechek, A. L. & Buss, D. M.\\"Opposite-Sex Friendship: Sex Differences and Similarities in Initiation, Selection, and Dissolution\\" , \\"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin\\", 2001. This demonstrates one way in which cross-sex friendships serve, in part, as a long term mating acquisition strategy. Having more opportunities to mate is an evolutionary advantage, however, being attracted to a cross-sex friend creates negative social consequences. This is especially true for younger adults who are attracted to a cross-sex friend, because these people report less satisfaction in their current romantic relationship. Also, middle-aged adults tend to nominate attraction to their cross-sex friends as more of a negative than a positive. =Social learning theory= In addition, social learning theory predicts that if cross-sex friendships are a result of the desire for sexual access and protection, this is because they are imitating other cross- sex friendships. Most popular television shows and movies suggest that the goal of forming cross-sex friendships is a romantic relationship. People learn from the friendships they see in popular culture and model their behavior after them. Preference for same sex relationships is a societal norm that is taught to children from a young age. This homosocial norm encourages same sex friendships early on that shape how adolescents view and measure cross-sex friendships. Culturally supported rules about friendships and gender influence the formation of interpersonal relationships. For this reason, ideas of cross- sex friendship can vary from place to place. While diverse cultures view relationships across genders differently, studies have shown that similar ideals for friendship seem to exist around the world in areas such as the United States, Europe, and East Asia. Additionally, adolescent definitions of cross-sex friendships closely match definitions given by adults, suggesting that children develop perceptions on the matter by imitating the opinions of adults in their lives. During adolescence, a distinction starts to form between romantic relationships and platonic friendships, which is influenced by personal experience as well as exposure to media and popular culture. Teenagers learn from portrayals of romance on television and base their own relationships on these representations. Popular media romanticizes and sexualizes interactions between people of opposite sexes, leading to a cultural expectation of sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships. This common conception leads a small percentage of the population to believe that men and women cannot exist in solely platonic friendships. =The glass partition= Kim Elsesser and Letitia Anne Peplau found that the professional workplace environment and heightened sexual harassment awareness can hinder cross-sex friendship formation. The barrier between men and women forming cross-sex friendships in the professional workplace is called the \\"glass partition\\" because of its similarities to the glass ceiling, which prevents women from reaching the top levels of leadership of corporations. The glass partition disadvantages women who work in predominantly male workplaces because women have fewer opportunities for networking. The glass partition results from fearing that friendliness toward a cross-sex friend will be misinterpreted by the friend and by co-workers as romantic or sexual interest, that humor may be perceived as sexual harassment by cross-sex friends, and that conversational topics might be perceived as offensive by cross-sex friends. When coworkers or other third parties see a cross-sex friendship in the workplace as romantic, this relationship is often viewed negatively, hurting both the male and female worker. This concern becomes specifically prevalent when dealing with cross-sex friendships between superiors and subordinates. It is more likely that this relationship can be misconstrued as often the subordinate, usually a female, might be seen as trying to make advances in order to further their career. Sexual harassment can hinder the development of cross-sex friendships as well. It is typical practice in companies and organizations to have policies against sexual harassment and to conduct trainings regarding sexual harassment. Due to this heightened awareness of sexual harassment occurrences, many individuals will step back from cross-sex friendships as they can sometimes be misinterpreted by the opposite sex individual or bystanders as sexual harassment. In the study conducted by Elsesser and Peplau, it was stated that most men interviewed in their study often think over conversation topics before initiating conversation with women coworkers, in fear that their comments would be misinterpreted as sexual harassment. In the cases of such wrong accusations, many would rather avoid the possibility of such a situation through avoiding the development of cross-sex friendships as opposed to deal with the possible misconceptions. Furthermore, it has been reported that oftentimes for men, there is a fear of offending the opposite sex regarding certain conversation topics. For instance, a male management consultant interviewed by Elsesser and Peplau stated that he commonly segregates by gender what type of jokes or humor he expresses in the workplace in fear that it might offend a female coworker. On the contrary, women often say that while they do not feel as though they censor their conversation as much, they can often sense such reservations and unwillingness to relax in men, making friendships awkward and harder to develop. The fear to create cross-sex friendships in the workplace becomes a problem as friendships amongst coworkers can be specifically important for career development. Friendships can provide information access, networking and emotional support to any individual all of which are valuable for job performance. Hence, when one is limited to forming friendships with those of the same sex, certainly, they are being deprived of advancement in the workplace. Thus, effort should be put into creating workplace environments where cross-sex friendships can be formed with less question or fear. Major empirical findings Research has been done in the areas of attraction, protection, perception, cross-sex friendships throughout development, and touch and sexual activity between cross-sex friends. These studies find that there are some evolutionary and social benefits to cross-sex friendships. However, there are also some negative social consequences. =Attraction= Within cross-sex friendships, men judge sexual attraction and the desire for sex as a more important reason than do women for initiating their friendship. Additionally, men are more sexually attracted to their opposite-sex friends and have more frequent desires to have sexual intercourse with their opposite- sex friends than women are. Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) found that men overestimate how much their female friends are attracted to them. Women are less likely to want to date their male friends if he is in a committed relationship, but men have the same desire to date their female friend whether or not she is dating someone. Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) hypothesize that a man's desire to date his female friend is not changed by whether or not their female friend is in a relationship. This is due to males‚Äô mating strategies that focus around acquiring short term mates. Furthermore, Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) suggest that men would pursue cross-sex relationships both when single and in a relationship, while women would be less likely to pursue cross-sex friends while dating someone. Attraction within these friendships can cause challenges. Sexual attraction can arise for a variety of reasons in cross-sex friendships. In a study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009), participants cited social pressures and emotional vulnerability as reasons for sexual attraction arising in a cross-sex friendship. A social pressure that may prompt sexual attraction between cross-sex friends is the perceptions other friends have of their relationship and emotional vulnerability coupled with closeness may provoke sexual attraction between cross-sex friends. When sexual attraction develops in a friendship, it can corrupt the friendship and individuals state that behavior often changes. Sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships is often dealt with in one of three ways: management of this attraction through communication or an internal decision not to pursue the attraction in order to preserve the friendship, a sexual relationship forms then dissipates, or sex becomes a part of the friendship. When participants in the study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009) were asked about their experience with sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships, over 50% had experienced attraction, and over 50% of that group had expressed or acted on their sexual attraction. However, men had a tendency to be more attracted to their cross- sex friends, and a higher tendency to act on that attraction. Only 16% of individuals who had acted on their sexual attraction claimed that their friendship ended as a result, otherwise the friendship remained intact or transformed into a romantic relationship. Reeder (2000) found that there are four types of attraction within cross-sex friendships: subjective physical/sexual attraction, objective physical/sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and friendship attraction.Reeder, H. \\"I like you...as a friend: The role of attraction in cross-sex friendship\\", \\"Journal of Social and Personal Relationships\\", 2000. Subjective physical/sexual attraction occurs when one of the individuals in the friendship is physically attracted to the other. Objective physical/sexual attraction happens when one individual thinks that the other is attractive in general, yet they are not attracted to the person. Romantic attraction within the cross-sex friendship occurs when one of the individuals within the friendship desires to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship because they believe he or she would make a good girlfriend or boyfriend. Friendship attraction is simply when an individual feels very platonically connected to his or her friend. The four types can coexist together within a friendship or can occur separately. Furthermore, the type of attraction that an individual feels within a cross-sex friendship can change over time. Within Reeder's (2000) sample, friendship attraction is the most prevalent type of attraction within cross-sex friendships. Even when participants felt other types of attraction within their cross-sex friendships, they prioritized their friendship attraction so that the relationship would not be ruined. =Protection= Historically, women are more vulnerable due to their smaller stature and lesser strength, on average, compared with men. Thus, women have consistently needed to secure protection for themselves. Seeking protection from men would have been an evolutionary advantage as women who do so increase their reproductive success, which has caused an evolved preference for men who are willing and able to offer protection. Therefore, it is not surprising that Bleske-Rechek & Buss (2001) found that women judged physical protection as a more important reason for initiating an opposite-sex friendship than did men and that opposite-sex friendship is a strategy women use for gaining physical protection. In this regard, males have historically been perceived as having an advantage in cross-sex friendships because the number of resources they have to offer in the relationship exceeds those of females (Monsour et al. 57). In terms of exchange principles within the friendship, women would benefit more than men (Monsour et al. 57). While women may enter into cross-sex friendships for protection, men may enter them for the possibility of sexual encounters (Akbulut and Weger 100). These interactions are desirable because men get to spread their genes through potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 100). In return, females can benefit from this type of cross-sex friendship through their friend's interest in potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 101). In this regard, the men within these cross-sex friendships would devote time and energy to caring for and protecting their potential children, which would be beneficial to the females in these relationships (Akbulut and Weger 101). Therefore, in cross-sex friendships, it has been discovered that males are commonly the ones more interested in initiating romantic relationships due to their potential benefits, as observed in a survey of male and female college students (Akbulut and Weger 110). =Perception= The way in which other individuals perceive cross-sex friends can affect the friendship itself. Cross-sex friends sometimes face the audience challenge within their social groups, which occurs when other people assume that they are in a romantic or sexual relationship and the cross-sex friends have to present themselves as just friends in response.Schoonover, K. and McEwan, B. \\"Are you really just friends? Predicting the audience challenge in cross-sex friendships\\", \\"Personal Relationships\\", 2014. Schoonover and McEwan (2014) state that since male-female romantic relationships are the norm, people often assume that cross-sex friendships have the potential to develop into a more intimate relationship. The different types of cross-sex friendships will experience the audience challenge in different ways. Strictly platonic friends are least likely to bring about the audience challenge, while mutual romance are the most likely to face the audience challenge. The number of cross-sex friends an individual has also plays a role in how their cross-sex friendships are perceived. When an individual has numerous cross-sex friendships, they are much less likely to face the audience challenge. Regardless of the severity of the audience challenge, those in cross-sex friendships have been found to spend a considerable amount of time thinking about how their relationship is perceived by others, according to the results of a study that surveyed young adults in cross-sex friendships (Schoonover and McEwan 399). If the peers within their social network of friends want or believe that the cross-sex friendship is romantic, issues could potentially arise in other relationships (Schoonover and McEwan 389). For example, if either member of the friendship has a romantic partner, that person could become jealous or suspicious, which could create tension and destroy the cross-sex friendship (Schoonover and McEwan 389). Therefore, the surrounding social network's opinions of the cross-sex friendship can change the degree that the friends have to worry about the audience challenge (Schoonover and McEwan 391). In other words, as the network's support of the cross-sex friendship as a strictly platonic relationship increases, the audience challenge decreases (Schoonover and McEwan 401). However, while the audience challenge can be a problematic issue for certain types of cross-sex friendships, it has found to not be commonly experienced within cross-sex friendships at large (Schoonover and McEwan 394). One of the main attributes to this finding was that members of the cross-sex friendships were able to effectively communicate with each other as well as their social network about the nature of their relationship and how they were being perceived (Monsour et al. 75). =Children‚Äôs and adolescent‚Äôs cross-sex friendships= Cross-sex friendships in childhood and adolescence often have an immense impact on adult cross-sex friendships. Successfully forming cross- sex friendships in childhood is often an indication that these individuals will be able to form positive cross-sex friendships later in life. Thus, early cross-sex friendships act as a blueprint for further social interactions. Children's social skills and behavior can be altered based on whether or not they have predominantly same-sex friends or cross-sex friends. One study by Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman (1996), they found that children who primarily had friends of the opposite sex were perceived to be more aggressive, yet less shy by others.Kovacs, D. M., Parker, J. G., & Hoffman, L. W. \\"Behavioral, Affective, and Social Correlates of Involvement in Cross‚ÄêSex Friendship in Elementary School\\", \\"Child Development\\", 1996. Furthermore, teachers said that the children with primarily friends of the opposite sex had lower academic performance and social skills, however faced less stereotyping in regards to gender roles and were better adjusted to their social atmosphere than children with few friends in general. Results from Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman's (1996) study show that children who have a best friend that is the opposite sex have poorer social functioning abilities. Yet, when children have friends primarily of the same sex, but some cross-sex friendships, they tend to be more well- adjusted and have stronger social skills. Additional studies conducted by Bell and Kalmijn oppose these negative observations behind cross-sex friendships in children, concluding that cross-sex friendships help children overcome communication barriers with the opposite sex, granting them an advantage with their social and communication skills later on. Their studies also observed that cross-sex friendships in children incorporate stronger senses of nurturance and intimacy that lack in same-sex friendships., as cited in Traustadottir, 2004, p. 4 Cross-sex friendships in adolescence are very different than in childhood. In adolescence, cross-sex friendships are not only more accepted by peers, but also can increase an individual's social status among same-sex peers.Winstead, B. A., Derlega, V. J., & Rose, S. \\"Gender and Close Relationships: An Introduction\\", \\"Journal of Social Issues\\", 1997. A study on adolescents in 6th through 8th grade conducted by Malow-Iroff (2006) discovered that adolescents often use the creation of cross-sex friends as a road to popularity because children with both cross-sex and same-sex friends are more accepted by both sexes.Malow-Iroff, M. \\"cross-sex Best Friendship Influences on Early Adolescent Cigarette and Alcohol Expectancies and Use\\", \\"The Journal of Psychology\\", 2006. Adolescents mainly look for cross-sex friends who are sociable, as they expect less from these friendships as they do from same-sex friends. Another study by Ami Flam Kuttler, Annette M. La Greca, and Mitchell J Prinstein surveyed 223 students from grades 10 through 12. The study concluded that although the number of cross-sex friendships in adolescents increase with age, both girls and boys felt a sense of stronger companionship and prosocial support with their friends of the same sex. However, adolescent boys claimed they felt as if their female companions provide support in regards to self-esteem more so than males. In addition to these findings, the study concluded that adolescents with predominately cross- sex friendships at these ages is perceived in relation to a lower social acceptance, rather than attaining to social or behavioral complications as observed in children through middle childhood. =Touch and sexual activity in cross-sex friendships= In cross-sex friendships, Miller, Denes, Diaz, and Ranjit (2014) found that when men believe the friendship to be strictly platonic, they are more open to touching their friend. However, when they think intimacy may be increasing in the relationship, they are less likely to desire casual touching. In contrast, the opposite was discovered to be true when it comes to women. Miller et al. (2014), found that women report being more uncomfortable if touched by their cross-sex friend in a public situation than men did. When there is touch between cross-sex friends, no matter how much intimacy is involved in the friendship, men tend to be more aroused by the touch than women are. The researchers hypothesize that the research results may have been confounded by a social desirability bias because women may be less likely to admit arousal from the touch of a cross-sex friend out of fear of being negatively labeled by others. Afifi and Faulkner (2000) investigated instances in which individuals had sexual interactions with their platonic cross-sex friends. 51% of their sample had sex with their friend when they had no intention of pursuing a romantic relationship with them, and 34% of participants noted having sexual relations with their friend on multiple occasions. Within Afifi & Faulkner's study, of those who had sex with their friend, two-thirds stated that it improved their relationship and 56% stated that the relationship did not develop into something romantic. Sexual interactions are recognized as a possible outcome of cross-sex friendships (Monsour et al. 56). In the face of these sexual overtones, some welcome the sexual tension in their cross-sex friendship while others note that the potential intimacy could destroy their relationship (Monsour et al. 57). With the sexual component, some friends are hesitant to enter into romantic relationships due to the anticipated disapproval of their social network of peers (Akbulut and Weger 109). Cross-sex friends often have overlapping social circles (Akbulut and Weger 109). Each member in the cross-sex friendship depends on their social network for support and other emotional needs (Akbulut and Weger 109). Thus, potentially falling out of touch with members of one's own social network if the romantic relationship did not work out, is too costly for some cross-sex friends, even if they have engaged in sexual interactions (Akbulut and Weger 109). Nature/nurture The biological basis for cross-sex relationships cannot be found in ancient human history, because the way humans conducted their lives is different from the way current humans do now. Up until 10,000 years ago, or for over 99% of homo history, humans‚Äô ancestors lived their lives in a nomadic fashion, foraging in groups structured by reproductive partners and offspring ‚Äî not unlike the way families are organized current-day. Females began reproducing at an early age, and males practiced behaviors that showcased ownership over their female partners in order to safeguard them from other males. There have only been scattered ethnographic references to cross-sex friendships across cultures. Therefore, for much of ancient human history, cross-sex friendships were not common. Today, men and women interact in non-romantic, supportive ways in all types of contexts: work, sports, education, and hobbies, yet these unions are not based on sexual intentions. Evolved mating strategies were mentioned earlier and can be dovetailed with this biological history. Controversies Participants in cross-sex friendships face many challenges, including learning how to navigate the particular type of friendship. The four types of cross-sex friendship as defined by Guerrero and Chavez (2005) referenced earlier are: strictly platonic, mutual romance, desires romance, and rejects romance. In addition, O‚ÄôMeara (1989) originally stated that the four essential challenges cross-sex friends face are: 1) determining the type of emotional bond experienced in the relationship, 2) confronting the issue of sexuality, 3) dealing with the issue of relationship equality within a cultural context of gender inequality, and 4) the challenge of public relationships ‚Äî presenting the relationship as authentic to relevant audiences. Schnoonover (2014) built research upon O‚ÄôMeara's audience challenge and found that members of Guerrero and Chavez's (2005) different friendship types may experience challenges differently. For example, for ‚Äúmutual romance‚Äù couples, members may be approaching the preliminary romantic stage of the relationship and if their romantic feelings feed into their behaviors toward each other, then they will be the most likely to be mistaken for a romantic couple. In contrast, ‚Äústrictly platonic‚Äù friends should be the least likely to prompt the audience challenge. ‚ÄúDesires romance‚Äù and ‚Äúrejects romance‚Äù couples may also be subject to the audience challenge ‚Äî if observers of the friendship see the member acting in a romantic manner or admitting romantic intent, the observers might be more likely to regard the cross-sex friendship as a growing romantic relationship more so than a friendship. Another controversial question surrounding cross-sex friendships that is often raised is - after two romantic partners end their relationship ‚Äî or more colloquially, ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù ‚Äî can they still be platonic friends? Kenny and Schneider (2000) found three major conclusions about cross-sex friendship with a romantic history. First, rebranding a discontinued romantic relationship as a friendship is common in modern American culture. Second, there are particular predictors of whether a friendship will occur after romance. One critical factor is whether there was a platonic friendship before the romantic relationship existed. Because the partners knew how to navigate friendship with each other before romance, they were more likely to be friends afterwards. Third, the atmosphere in which the breakup occurred determined the likelihood of a post-friendship. Kenny and Schneider (2000) cited evidence noting that a more significant indicator of an upcoming friendship is the communication in which the breakup occurred, not the individual who first initiated the breakup. When looking at how men and women's same sex relationships work, men tend to talk about more of their problems and open up more with women, rather than their other male friendships which tends to facilitate a bit of a gray area of what is expected when a man and a woman are friends. Cross-sex friendship can exist after marriage when the married couple transition out of the passionate phase. Original feelings while dating are feelings of passion and what many describe as love, however as the relationship progresses through the years and into marriage, studies have found these feelings to be diminished and transition into more of a friendship. This is a topic of controversy as some argue it cannot be labeled as a cross sex ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù but rather a romantic relationship, however a study by Alan Booth and Elaine Hess (1974) dictates that almost all cross sex friendships can have some sexual/romantic influence, however it does not discount the friendship. The ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù has also focused on the argument that two people of opposite sexes can never be friends, and many saying that no friendship can occur after one party has made it evident that they have romantic feelings for the other. This coincides with questions on if the parties involved can have had or currently have romantic feelings for one another, or if a friendship must be based on solely feelings of platonic friendship for the duration of the friendship. The definition of a cross-sex friendship that J. Donald O'Meara (1989) gives is a relationship between a man and a woman that is not primarily focused on romance, but is not always void of romantic feelings, meaning that once one party had been in the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù as long as the relationship is primarily aimed towards a friendship, it is still a cross-sex friendship. Researchers in child development psychology, more specifically a study done by Donna M. Kovacs, Jeffrey G. Parker and Lois W. Hoffman (1996) looked into children's cross sex friendships, and found an absence of these types of friendships at younger ages. This raised cause for concern within the study as the researchers discussed how this could be due to a greater separation of genders at younger ages, which can reinforce societal defined gender roles, and prevent these types of friendships, which can be beneficial to development from occurring.

Marjan, which in Persian means coral, was born in West Germany in 1976 and was given as a gift to Kabul Zoo in 1978 by the Cologne Zoo. He arrived in the Afghan capital and, soon afterwards, a lioness by the name of Chucha joined him. The lion witnessed Afghanistan's turbulent history, from the communist coup, the Soviet occupation, the state of warlordism, and the hardline Taliban regime. During the 1990s civil war, the state of total chaos enveloped Kabul Zoo in the middle of a battlefield. The zoo was shelled on many occasions, even destroying its medical supply facility, leaving zoo personnel unable to help Marjan. He is seen as a symbol of survival and a desire for peace by the Afghans. On March 27, 1995, a soldier sneaked into the lion's den to show off his bravery to fellow soldiers. The man stroked Chucha, the lioness, who did not react, but Marjan attacked the man and killed him within minutes. The following day, the man's brother threw a hand grenade in Marjan's den in revenge of his death, seriously injuring Marjan. His eyes had to be removed by MDM, a PSF (Pharmaciens Sans Fronti√®res) Logistics Officer who first called for help, MSF doctors and an Italian photojournalist, thus rendering him blind, deaf, and permanently disabled. Despite several operations, neither Marjan's eyesight nor his mouth could be saved. He lost all of his teeth, making it impossible for him to eat boned meat. A ramp was also built for him to get back into his den, as he was seen falling a few times while trying to make it back inside. The incident sparked outrage with animal rights activists, local and abroad. The man who threw the grenade was violently attacked a week later, and died of injuries. With the arrival of the United States-led coalition in 2001 and the revealing of the devastating conditions in Kabul's once well-kept Zoo, the western media quickly picked up the story of the lion. As the news spread, Marjan became an instant celebrity and many animal welfare organizations, such as World Animal Protection, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and many zoos around the world, lent a helping hand in form of money, medical supplies, as well as personnel that included vets and nurses. Despite overwhelming response, Marjan succumbed to old age and died in January 2002. Both private and public funeral ceremonies were held for the famous lion that was buried in the zoo. On his grave is posted a sentence in Pashto: Here lies Marjan, who was about 23. He was the most famous lion in the world. In March 2002, China donated a pair of lions to the Kabul Zoo to replace Marjan. =In fiction= Marjan is mentioned in Khaled Hosseini's novel \\"The Kite Runner\\" and is the central and eponymous figure in the play The Lion of Kabul by Colin Teevan, part of The Great Game: Afghanistan. Marjan appears in Denis Johnson's essay collection Seek. More recently Marjan has also been mentioned in Kim Barker's book \\"The Taliban Shuffle\\". A deleted scene in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot features the attack on Marjan. He is also the subject of Dwyer Jones' poem, \\"Lion of Afghanistan (Apology to Marjan).\\" In a poem \\"In Kabul Zoo, The Lion\\", Jeet Thayil writes about the suffering, resilience and strength from the perspective of Marjan himself.

He is regarded as the founder of UNICEF, and served as its first Chairman from 1946 to 1950. Family He was born to Aleksander Rajchman, the creator and first director of the Warsaw Philharmonic, and Melania Hirszfeld, a socialist and women's rights activist. He was from a family of Christianized Polish Jews. While his parents were agnostic, Ludwik was baptized at birth. He is the brother of Aleksander Rajchman, a prominent Polish mathematician and of Helena Radlinska, a Polish sociologist and he is the first cousin of Ludwik Hirszfeld, a Polish microbiologist. Ludwik Rajchman is the father of Jan A. Rajchman, a Polish computer scientist, inventor of magnetic-core memory.  Biography  Rajchman grew up in Warsaw in the difficult conditions of the Russian occupation. At an early age, he and his sister Helena became keenly aware of the social injustices in their \\"country\\" (Poland did not officially exist at the time) and were involved as teenagers in teaching young workers. As an adult, he joined the Polish socialist party (PPS) and was involved in the 1905 uprising and even arrested. After several months in prison he was exiled for a while to Kharkov. Ludwik Rajchman studied medicine at the Jagellonian University in Krakow, where he met his future wife, Marja Bojanczyk who was also a medical student. He became fascinated by bacteriology as taught to him by Odo Bujwid who had worked with Louis Pasteur. Rajchman did his post-doctoral studies at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, then briefly returned to Krakow (he was banned from going to the Russian-occupied part of Poland), before being named to a prominent bacteriological laboratory in London. Rajchman and his wife and three children remained in London throughout the First World War, during which time Rajchman was kept busy also as a PPS activist lobbying for Polish independence after the war. The family returned to Warsaw in October 1918 and Rajchman (who was well acquainted with the Polish elite thanks to his family connections) persuaded the new Polish authorities to create an epidemiological center, subsequently renamed \\"Panstwowy Zaklad Higieny\\" (National Institute of Hygiene) which exists in Warsaw to this day as Poland's main public health institute. Rajchman was very active in the fight against several waves of a typhus epidemic which was devastating Eastern Europe and as such was noticed by the burgeoning League of Nations, which named him in 1921 to set up a Health Organization for the LN in Geneva, Switzerland. The Health Organization is largely regarded as one of the LN's most successful undertakings. Rajchman travelled extensively to fulfill his mandate and notably became fascinated by the need for a quarantine and public health system in China: as such he became adviser to the Chinese government and became intimate with the Chang Kai-shek family and especially with TV Soong, the then Minister of Economy and brother of Madame Chang Kai- shek. In 1924, together with Arthur Sweetser (the League of Nations' Press Officer), and the Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau educators Adolphe Ferri√®re and Paul Meyhoffer, he founded the International School of Geneva - the first of its kind in the world.https://cdn.ymaws.com/alumni.ecolint.ch/resource/resmgr/magazines_newsletters/echo_17_web.pdfhttps://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15482&LangID;=E In the early 1930s, Rajchman became known in Geneva for his anti-fascist and anti-appeaser attitudes and actions. He no longer pleased politically the French appeaser director of the LN, Joseph Avenol, who dismissed him from his functions in 1938. Finding himself without a job, Rajchman went to China to help the government prepare their defense against Japan, notably by buying airplanes from the United States. His family moved to France, purchasing a \\"chateau\\" in Sarthe, a western region of France. The whole family was there when the Germans invaded France. Rajchman went to see the President of the Polish government in exile, General Sikorski whom he knew personally. Sikorski named him to be in charge of Polish refugees and gave him a letter to take to President Roosevelt asking for US help; he also issued Rajchman a diplomatic passport which was what allowed him to flee France through Spain and Portugal and eventually reach Washington DC. During the war, Rajchman worked on humanitarian issues,Jakub Polit, \\"Chiny\\". Wydawnictwo Trio, Warszawa 2004. p. 407. but also as adviser to TV Soong in development issues: indeed he was said to have belonged to the famous \\"Chinese Lobby\\". Towards the end of the war, UNRRA commissioned him to write a report on how to deal with the drastic state of health conditions once Europe would be freed (notably a typhus epidemic was feared). At the end of the war, the new (communist) Polish government in Lublin asked him to represent Poland within UNRRA. It is said that Rajchman had serious hesitations about collaborating with this government, but in the end he was won over by the desire to help his country which he did in fact very effectively through UNRRA. When UNRRA announced at a UN meeting in Geneva that it would be putting an end to its relief efforts, Rajchman stood up before the assembly and called for the creation of a Fund dedicated to helping children throughout the world. His proposal was accepted and by the beginning of 1947, UNICEF was already helping children, notably in nutrition and immunization. Rajchman remained Chairman of the Board at UNICEF until 1950 and refused to be paid for his work. In the context of the nascent cold war and Stalin-ism in Soviet block countries, Rajchman was subpoenaed in the McCarthy period: he abruptly left for France and never returned to the United States. At the same time, the Polish communist authorities withdrew his Polish passport and he was not reissued one until the post-Stalinist period began in 1956. From then on Rajchman went fairly often to Poland, notably to visit his sister who had been dismissed by the authorities from her academic functions. His last visit was to Warsaw in 1963, to visit the public health institute he had founded in 1918. Rajchman died in 1965 due to complications of Parkinson's Disease.

Temporal means related to the measurement or passing of time and encroachment is an intrusion, usually unwelcome, into the space of another. The space that temporal encroachment refers to is temporal space, the temporal \\"space\\" or \\"territory\\" upon which others attach significance. There are various kinds of temporal encroachment: Scheduling This is when one group or person delays another person. A good example is a vice president making a lower-ranked employee wait in his outer office while he conducts business. Another good example is a valued worker who always shows up late to work but this is allowed due to his abilities. This kind of encroachment is very common in the workplace. Various cultures look at this differently‚Äîthe Japanese are very punctual, while most Latin and Baltic cultures would be more relaxed with time, instead looking at social parameters. Future 'space' This refers to actions taken that influence events 'down the line', narrowing possible choices and alternatives. It is worth noting that the most common use of this phrase is found in ecology, where there is a large amount of concern about the effects of human encroachment upon animals and other wildlife. Encroachment can be a good or bad factor in the lives of the animals, but most commonly, it is bad. It has been used by some Jewish thinkersSpringerLink - Resource Secured to refer to changes in Zionism that have 'ripple effects' on Jews worldwide, and the effect this has had on global terrorism. It has also been used in the legal system, where some legal thinkers believe early correction of poverty and other socioeconomic ills can 'narrow' the likelihood of future criminality. Past 'space' It can also reflect a sense that modern events and interpretations of history alter and change our perceptions of history. For example, the involvement of the Papacy in the formation of the structure of medieval Europe was viewed differently at the time than it is today. Some also view it as the encroachment of the young on the old, see Encroachment of old age below. Examples Some examples of temporal encroachment in other contexts.Varieties of Encroachment > Encroachment from flooding: Construction of settlements in flood plains, > ignoring the tendency of rivers to flood occasionally, results in situations > in which river water encroaches on properties in ways that can prove > extremely costly.

The patron of the parish and the town is Saint Donatus of Muenstereifel, whose cultus is popular in Luxembourg and the Rhineland. The parish complex includes a church building, rectory, chapel and cemetery. They are all contributing properties in the Village of St. Donatus Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description St. Donatus Cemetery One of the outdoor Stations of the Cross The original church building, modeled after St. Boniface Church in New Vienna, was completed in 1858. It was destroyed in a fire on November 24, 1907. The exterior stone walls survived, and were used to build the present church. It was completed in 1908. The stone for the bell tower was quarried from the nearby bluffs. It is capped by a wooden steeple. There is little in the way of exterior ornamentation. The exterior stone walls have been covered with a coating of cement and lime. The parish cemetery is located behind the church. Some of the earlier graves are marked by elaborate iron crosses. Some of the early stone headstones were made in Dubuque, while others were created by 0. Wenzler of Milwaukee. The rectory, located next to the church, is a contemporary of the original church. It was built of stone that was quarried nearby and covered with light yellow/brown stucco. It is capped with a hip roof that features cross gabled dormer windows. The moderate pitch of the roof and the lack of eaves are typical of traditional Luxembourg architecture. The parish is known for its outdoor Stations of the Cross located on the hill behind the church. They were constructed in 1861 under the direction of the Rev. J. Michael Flammang, and may be one of the first developed in the United States. Each of the fourteen stations are , and are placed in open, arched entrances and gabled roofs.

Kushner addresses in the book one of the principal problems of theodicy, the conundrum of why, if the universe was created and is governed by a God who is of a good and loving nature, there is nonetheless so much suffering and pain in it - essentially, the evidential problem of evil. The book argues for theistic finitism.Michael, Martin. (1990). The Finite God Theodicy. In Atheism: A Philosophical Justification. Temple University Press. pp. 436-438. Kushner proposes a finite God solution to the problem of evil. God is benevolent but not all-powerful to prevent evil. The book is dedicated to the memory of Kushner's young son, Aaron, who died at the age of 14 in 1977 of the incurable genetic disease progeria. Rabbi Kushner's book was a New York Times bestseller for many months in the non-fiction category. Thesis Kushner seeks to offer comfort to grieving people. His answer to the philosophical problem is that God does his best and is with people in their suffering, but is not fully able to prevent it. Kushner's beliefs, which seem to question God's omnipotence, have been criticized by some conservative scholars associated with Orthodox JudaismRabbi Y.

In June 2008, it was released as free software under the GNU GPLv2 license.Press release concerning the release of the AdvFS source code AdvFS has been used in high-availability systems where fast recovery from downtime is essential. Functionality AdvFS uses a relatively advanced concept of a storage pool (called a file domain) and of logical file systems (called file sets). A file domain is composed of any number of block devices, which could be partitions, LVM or LSM devices. A file set is a logical file system created in a single file domain. Administrators can add or remove volumes from an active file domain, providing that there is enough space on the remaining file domain, in case of removal. This was one of the trickier original features to implement because all data or metadata residing on the disk being removed had to first be migrated, online, to other disks, prior to removal. File sets can be balanced, meaning that file content of file sets be balanced across physical volumes. Particular files in a file set can be striped across available volumes. Administrators can take a snapshot (or clone) of any active or inactive file set. This allows for easy on-line backups. Another feature allows administrators to add or remove block devices from a file domain, while the file domain has active users. This add/remove feature allows migration to larger devices or migration from potentially failing hardware without a system shutdown. = Features = Its features include: * a journal to allow for fast crash recovery * undeletion support * high performance * dynamic structure that allows an administrator to manage the file system on the fly * on the fly creation of snapshots * defragmentation while the domain has active users Under Linux, AdvFS supports an additional ‚Äò‚Äôsyncv‚Äô‚Äô system call to atomically commit changes to multiple files.Verma, Rajat, et al. \\"Failure-atomic updates of application data in a Linux file system.‚Äù 13th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST 15). 2015. online version  History  AdvFS, also known as Tru64 UNIX Advanced File System, was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation engineers in the late 1980s to mid-1990s in Bellevue, WA (DECwest). They had previously worked on the earlier (cancelled) Mica and Ozix projects there. It was first delivered on the DEC OSF/1 system (later Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX). Over time, development moved to teams located in Bellevue, WA and Nashua, NH. Versions were always one version number behind the operating system version. Thus, DEC OSF/1 v3.2 had AdvFS v2.x, Digital UNIX 4.0 had AdvFS v3.x and Tru64 UNIX 5.x had AdvFS v4.x. It is generally considered that only AdvFS v4 had matured to production level stability, with a sufficient set of tools to get administrators out of any kind of trouble. The original team had enough confidence in its log based recovery to release it without an \\"fsck\\" style recovery utility on the assumption that the file system journal would always be allocated on mirrored drives.

In the years before and just after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty Chinese anarchists insisted that a true revolution could not be political, replacing one government with another, but had to overthrow traditional culture and create new social practices, especially in the family. \\"Anarchism\\" was translated into Chinese as ÁÑ°ÊîøÂ∫ú‰∏ªÁæ© (w√∫zh√®ngf«î zh«îy√¨) literally, \\"the doctrine of no government.\\" Chinese students in Japan and France eagerly sought out anarchist doctrines to first understand their home country and then to change it. These groups relied on education to create a culture in which strong government would not be needed because men and women were humane in their relations with each other in the family and in society. Groups in Paris and Tokyo published journals and translations that were eagerly read in China and the Paris group organized the Work-Study Programs to bring students to France. The late 19th and early 20th century Nihilist movement and anarchist communism in Russia were a major influence. The use of assassination as a tool was promoted by groups like the Chinese Assassination Corps, similar to the suicidal terror attacks by Russian anti-czarist groups. By the 1920s, however, the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party offered organizational strength and political change which drained support from anarchists. Chinese student movements Doufu Factory Night School 1916 The Chinese anarchist presence appeared first in France and Japan when the sons of wealthy families went abroad for study after the failed Boxer Rebellion. By 1906 national and provincial programs sent between five and six hundred students to Europe and about 10,000 to Japan. Japan, especially Tokyo, was the most popular destination because of its geographic proximity to China, its relatively affordable cost, and certain affinities between the two cultures. The Japanese language use of Chinese characters made it somewhat easier to learn. In Europe, Paris was particularly popular. Living in the city was relatively cheap, the French government subsidized the students, and France was seen as the center of Western civilization. The Chinese government officials may also have wanted to get radical students out of the country. The most radical students went to Europe and the more moderate students to Japan. That policy was to prove remarkably short-sighted as these foreign-educated students would use the methods and ideologies of European socialism and anarchism to completely transform Chinese society. In both locations of study, anarchism quickly became the most dominant of the western ideologies adopted by the students. In 1906, within a few months of each other, two separate anarchist student groups would form, one in Tokyo and one in Paris. The different locations, and perhaps also the different inclinations of the students being sent to each location, would result in two very different kinds of anarchism. =Paris group= Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingzhang, and Li Shizeng, Leaders of the Xin Shijie SocietyThe so- called \\"Paris Group\\" gradually organized around the figures Zhang Renjie (also known as Zhang Jingzhang) and Li Shizeng, who arrived in Paris in 1902 as attaches to the Chinese embassy. They were soon joined by Wu Zhihui, an older and more intellectually rigorous figure and a radical critic of the Qing government. Wu introduced the group to his friend, Cai Yuanpei, who became a leader of the New Culture Movement. In 1906 Zhang, Li, and Wu founded the first Chinese anarchist organization, the World Society (‰∏ñÁïåÁ§æ Shijie she), sometimes translated as New World Society. In 1908, the World Society started a weekly journal, Xin Shiji Êñ∞‰∏ñÁ¥ÄÈÄ±Â†± (New Era or New Century; titled La Novaj Tempaj in Esperanto), to introduce Chinese students in France, Japan, and China to the history of European radicalism. Other contributors included Wang Jingwei, Zhang Ji, and Chu Minyi, a student from Zhejiang who accompanied Zhang Renjie back from China and would be his assistant in the years to come. Li wrote that the influences of the Paris group could be divided into 3 main fields: radical libertarianism and anarchism; Darwinism and Social Darwinism; and the classical Chinese philosophers. While the Paris group was more reluctant than their counterparts in Tokyo to equate the teachings of Lao Tzu or the ancient well-field system with the anarchist communism they advocated, Li describes the group as consisting of young men who had received excellent educations in the Chinese classical tradition. He admits that the old thinking influenced them. The clear trend with the Paris group, however, was to dismiss and even actively oppose any association of anarchism with traditional culture. For the Paris group, as the historian Peter Zarrow puts it, \\"science was truth and truth was science.\\" =Tokyo group= Liu Shipei and He Zhen The Tokyo group drew on the same influences but in a different order of preference. While the Paris group was enamored of western science and western civilization, leaders such as Liu Shifu rooted their anarchism in political traditions native to Asia. In practical terms this meant the Paris group studied Esperanto, advocated anarcho-syndicalism, and drew heavily upon the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. The Tokyo group advocated an agrarian society built around democratically run villages organized into a free federation for mutual aid and defense. They based their ideology on a fusion of Taoism, Buddhism, and the \\"well field system\\" of ancient China, and gave preference to Leo Tolstoy over Kropotkin. Liu Shipei and He Zhen, his wife, split from the programs of the Zhang Binglin and other Tokyo leaders and returned to Shanghai. When it became public that the couple had been informers working for the Manchu official Duanfang, they were shunned. The Paris and Tokyo also initially advocated assassination, perhaps an indicator of the lasting influences of nihilism, but by 1910 conversion to anarchism was typically accompanied by the renunciation of assassination as a tactic. =Cooperation and differences= In the early 20th century the anarchist movement was largely a western movement and the Chinese students studying in Paris were enthusiastically supportive of anarchism because they saw it as the most forward-thinking of all the western ideologies, and thus the furthest removed from what they perceived as a Chinese culture moribund by tradition. This position would repeatedly place them at odds with the Tokyo group who saw much that was good in traditional culture, and even argued that because China had not embraced the illusion of liberal capitalist democracy, it might be easier for them to make the transition to anarchism than it would be for the Europeans. These differences, however, do not mean that the two groups did not cooperate. Because of the decentralised political structure and emphasis on local economic and political self-determination advocated by both groups, they were able to come to a tacit understanding that after the revolution both systems could peacefully coexist. The conflict was essentially one of values, priorities, and (by implication) methods for achieving the revolution which both advocated. In particular, the conflict over what place, if any, traditional Chinese philosophies should play in influencing anarchist thoughts and actions. This was a major source of friction and debate between the two groups. The tendency for the advocates of different anarchisms to disagree on issues but agree to cooperate is not unique to the Chinese anarchist experience. For this reason many political scientists describe anarchism as a movement of movements. The ideological diversity inherent in such a movement of movements has historically been one of its great strengths but has also repeatedly undermined attempts to shape it into a cohesive force for social change. Anarchism and nationalism In the first phase of the movement, anarchists of both schools were generally participants in the Nationalist movement, even though in theory they repudiated nationalism and nation-states. They were influenced by foreign movements such as The People's Will and pan- Slavic nationalists like The Black Hand. Even though anarchism and nihilism are distinct and separate ideologies, at that time the popular press in Europe and China generally conflated the two. At the International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists, anarchism was defined \\"as any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society\\". This association with political violence promoted an early interest in anarchism among some Chinese radicals. =Nationalist attacks= The first attacks on the growing anarchist movement in China came from nationalists who saw anarchism as a threat to a strong, unified, centralized modern nation that could stand up to Western imperialism. As one reader wrote in a letter to Xin Shiji (The New World), the anarchist newspaper published by the Paris group: Nationalists also argued that only by building a popular front could the revolutionary movement defeat the Manchus and the Qing Dynasty, and that in the long run if anarchism was to succeed it must be preceded by a Republican system that would make China secure. =Anarchist response= Li Shizeng The response of the Xin Shiji editors, written by Li Shizeng, was threefold. First, the revolution that the anarchists advocated would be global, simultaneous, decentralized, and spontaneous. Thus, foreign imperialists would be too occupied with the revolutions in their home countries to bother invading or harassing China. Secondly, they argued that having a strong centralized coercive government had not prevented China's enemies from attacking her in the past anyway. Finally, there was the moral point that in the long run, tyranny is tyranny, regardless of whether it is native or foreign. Therefore, the only logical approach for people who want freedom must be to oppose all authority be it Manchu, Han, foreign, or native. Critics then and later asked how the Chinese anarchists could expect a global spontaneous revolution to come about. Li and the Paris group assumed, as did many radicals of all stripes all over the globe at that time, that Revolution was something akin to a force of nature. Within the context of their thinking, Revolution would come because it was obviously needed, and their role was simply to prepare people for it and help them see the obvious necessity of social change. This perspective provides important insight into the fundamentally evolutionary nature of the movement, and explains the movement's focus on education instead of organization building. =Results of collaboration= Zhang Ji Minguo The involvement of prominent Nationalist figures indicates the role of personal relationships in the Paris groups' organizing. The individuals who founded that group had come out of the Nationalist movement and remained strongly tied to it by a network of close personal friendships. Therefore, it was natural for them to attempt to include their friends in their organizing in the hopes of winning those friends (and the influence they possessed) over to the anarchist cause. The actual result of such collaboration was that the anarchists, not the Nationalists, compromised their positions since doing so allowed them to gain access to power positions in the Nationalist government that they theoretically opposed. That same year Jing Meijiu and Zhang Ji (another anarchist affiliated with the Tokyo group) would both be elected to the Republican parliament. Shifu and the Guangzhou group declared that by doing so they were traitors to the cause and proved their lack of commitment to the movement, but both men continued to call themselves anarchists and were active in promoting anarchism clear up to the late 1920s. As a counterpoint to such collaboration, however, there is evidence that many more anarchists could have joined the new Nationalist government and gained positions of power and privilege but refused to do so because doing so would have violated their principles. As Scalapino and Yu put it \\"there can be little doubt that many refused to play the kind of political role that was so desperately needed in a period when trained personnel were extremely scarce compared to the tasks at hand.\\" =Strategic issues= Arif Dirlik argues that these problems were indicative of lingering ambiguity in the definition of anarchism. More accurately, the issue was one of strategy. These men considered themselves anarchists because they were working for the long-term abolition of capitalism, the state, and coercive authority in general. In their vision, anarchism was a very long-term goal and not something they expected to see realized in their lifetimes. Chiang, for instance, expected that it would take 3,000 years to bring about the revolution they dreamed of. Understanding that, it becomes easier to see why anarchists would be tempted to campaign for and hold political office or collaborate with sympathetic elements in the government, since doing so would help them achieve their long- term goals. This attitude is clearly distinct from the revolutionary anarchism of Kropotkin and Bakunin, or even of the Guangzhou group, which aimed for immediate revolution and the creation of an anarchist society in the immediate future. This tendency to work for long-term revolution and focus on philosophy and theory instead of concrete organizing by some of the wealthier participants in the movement might have been rooted in class backgrounds. The split between wealthier philosophical anarchists, Marxists, or socialists, and working class revolutionaries can be a common feature of revolutionary movements. Early growth of anarchism The Paris group declared that education was the most important activity revolutionaries could be involved in, and that only through educating the people could anarchism be achieved. [See for example Wu Zhihui: \\"Education as Revolution,\\" The New Era, September 1908] Accordingly, they geared their activities towards education instead of assassination or grass roots organizing (the other two forms of activism which they condoned in theory). To these ends the Paris group set up a variety of businesses, including a soy products factory, which employed worker-students from China who wanted an education abroad. The students worked part-time and studied part-time, thus gaining a European education for a fraction of what it would cost otherwise. Many also gained first-hand experience on what it might mean to live, work, and study in an anarchist society. This study-abroad program played a critical role in infusing anarchist language and ideas into the broader nationalist and revolutionary movements as hundreds of students participated in the program. The approach demonstrated that anarchist organizational models based on mutual aid and cooperation were viable alternatives to profit-driven capitalist ventures. The Paris and Tokyo groups both rallied to the nationalist cause. Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Renjie became early members of the Kuomintang and became close friends of Sun Yat- Sen. Sun received \\"considerable\\" economic assistance from Zhang. This collaboration was understandable given the emphasis by both the anarchists and the nationalists on the importance of Revolutionaries working together, and because of the eclecticism of Sun Yat-sen, who stated that \\"the end goal of the three peoples principles [was] communism and anarchism.\\" Anarchism as a mass movement By 1911 anarchism had become the driving force behind popular mobilization and had moved beyond its initial association with relatively wealthy students studying abroad to become a genuine revolutionary movement among the people as a whole. There is some evidence that the grassroots workers movement which was developing at this time enjoyed a secondary influx of anarchist ideals as people who had been working in the United States were forced to return to China following the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. This act severely limited (but did not eliminate) the flow of Chinese workers to and from the United States. =Influence of U.S. anarchists= In the United States, anarchists had been almost alone in the labor movement in explicitly opposing racism against Asian and Mexican workers, and when Emma Goldman came to speak in San Francisco in the 1890s there were several thousand Chinese workers in attendance. Additionally, from 1908 on, many thousands of Chinese workers in North America - particularly those working in California and the Pacific North-West - became members of the Industrial Union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The Wobblies (as IWW members were called) were the first American labor union to oppose the institution of White supremacy in an organized and deliberate fashion and to actively recruit Asians, Blacks, Latinos, and migratory workers. Their defense of Chinese immigrants who were being subjected to systematic harassment and discrimination won them a large base of membership among Chinese workers, and widespread support among the Chinese community in North America. The influence of Chinese IWW members returning to China has gone largely unstudied, but the strong anarchist participation in the Chinese union movement and the willing reception that they met may owe something to this earlier relationship between Chinese workers and anarchist Revolutionaries. =Nationalist revolution of 1911= Following the Nationalist revolution of 1911 and the victory of the Revolutionary Alliance, which counted several prominent anarchists as movement elders, anarchists throughout China had a bit more room to engage in organizing. At the same time, Nationalist rule was by no means a guarantee of freedom to organize for antiauthoritarians, and government persecution was ongoing. With Nationalist goals of overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty having been achieved, the main ideological opposition to anarchism came from self- described Socialists, including the Chinese Socialist Society (CSS) and the Left wing of the nationalist movement which ‚Äì following Sun Yet-Sen's lead ‚Äì called itself socialist. Jiang Kanghu, who founded the Chinese Socialist Society in 1911, had been a contributor to the New Era (one of the publications of the Paris Group), and included the abolition of the state, the traditional family structure, and Confucian culture as planks of his parties' platform. The main source of conflict came because the CSS wanted to retain market relations but supplement them with a broad social safety net, since they felt that without any incentive mechanism people would not produce anything and the society would collapse. Other sources of friction had to do with the CSS's focus on building the revolution in China first, and using elected office as a tool to do so ‚Äì both significant deviations from classical anarchism. Jiang did not call himself an anarchist, so his party was generally perceived as being outside the movement, despite the similarities. In 1912 Jiang's party split into two factions, the pure socialists, led by the anarchist Buddhist monk Tai Xu, and the remains of the party led by Jiang. Liu Shifu, who would go on to be one of the most significant figures in the anarchist movement in mainland China founded a group in Guangzhou later that same year, with an explicitly anarchist-communist platform. =Pure Socialist= The Pure Socialists revised platform included the complete abolition of property and an anarchist-communist economic system. Shifu criticized them for retaining the name \\"Socialist\\" but their platform was clearly anarchist so the two groups generally considered each other comrades. The emphasis on the importance of the Peasant struggle, which had been pioneered earlier by the Tokyo group, would also become a major subject of discussion and organizing among Chinese anarchists from both the Pure Socialists and the Guangzhou group in this period. It was anarchists who first pointed to the crucial role that the peasants must play in any serious revolutionary attempt in China, and anarchists were the first to engage in any serious attempts to organize the Peasants. =Guangzhou group= Liu Shifu, a member of the Guangzhou group. The main base of anarchist activity in mainland China during this phase was in Guangzhou, and the Paris and Tokyo groups continued to have significant influence. The Pure Socialists were also strongly involved, but because they were Buddhists as much as they were anarchists, were more concerned with promoting virtue and less focused on immediate revolution. By this time the Paris group had rendered their anarchism into a genuine philosophy that was more concerned with the place of the peaceful individual within society than with the day-to-day grind of government coercion against working people. Their tendency toward peace was somewhat surprising given the relatively wealthy backgrounds of most of the Paris group, but it would lead to increased friction between them and those comrades supportive of government coercion in Guangzhou. The Guangzhou group is usually described as being \\"led\\" by Liu Shifu, and this is generally accurate insofar as we understand it as leadership by example since he was never granted any formal position or coercive authority by the group. Their most significant contributions at this stage were the foundation of \\"an alliance between intellectuals and workers\\" and their propaganda work which set out to differentiate anarchism from all the other socialisms that were gaining in popularity; and in so doing crystallized for the first time exactly what anarchism was. Where the Paris group had preferred to outline their ideal in terms of negative freedoms, i.e., freedom from coercion, freedom from tradition, etc.; the Guangzhou group used positive assertions of rights and workers, women, peasants, and other oppressed groups to outline their vision of an anarchist society. Noticeably absent was any mention of ethnic minorities, since a basic part of their platform was the elimination of ethnic, racial, and national identities in favor of an internationalist identity that placed primary importance on loyalty to humanity as a whole, instead of to ones ethnic or racial group. This position was formulated in response to the primacy placed on ethnicity by the Anti-Manchu movement, which sought to assert the illegitimacy of the Qing dynasty based in part on the fact that its members were part of an ethnic minority out of touch with the Han majority, a position which anarchists of all four major groups decried as racist and unbefitting a movement that claimed to be working for liberation. Their position, therefore, was that ethnicity-based organizing promoted Racism, and had no place in a Revolution that sought liberation for all of humanity. In practical terms, the work of the movement at this stage was propaganda and organizing. Guangzhou anarchists founded a newspaper called Peoples Voice and began organizing workers, while in Taiyuan, in Shanxi province in the northwest, Jing Meijiu - who had converted to anarchism as part of the Tokyo group - founded an explicitly anarchafeminist worker-run factory/school to serve as a tool to help women simultaneously earn a living and receive an education. =Paris group influence= The similarity to the Paris group's \\"Diligent Work and Frugal Study\\" program is obvious. In 1912, members of the Paris group that had returned to China established the Promote Virtue Society whose leadership included prominent anarchists like Li Shizeng and Nationalists like Wang Jingwei. The focus of that society, in keeping with the tendencies of the Paris group, was as much on virtuous and moral personal behavior as it was on Revolutionary praxis. Their rules for membership delineated different levels of commitment and discouraged members from eating meat and visiting prostitutes; and concretely forbade them from riding in Sedan chairs, taking concubines, or holding public office. While it may be tempting to see such rules as superfluous, the evidence suggests we should take them seriously, since most of the anarchist organizations in China in this period included similar rules for their members. The goal was to create a cadre of Revolutionaries who would lead by example and help create a model for a new revolutionary culture. There are obvious parallels here to the traditional obligation for people involved in public life to set an example and promote virtue as well. =Diffusion of anarchist ideas= The practical implications of such a broad diffusion of anarchist ideas, and the setting in which it took place, are both strong indicators of the strong fusion of pragmatism and idealism that typified the Paris group's activities. In any case, the increased contact with actual flesh-and-blood workers had a profound effect on their propaganda and theory, with labor issues suddenly becoming a much more prominent part of their platform. Anarchism as popular movement By 1914 anarchism had become a genuine popular movement in China as increasing numbers of people from peasants and factory workers to intellectuals and students became disillusioned with the Nationalist government and its inability to realize the peace and prosperity it had promised. A major liability that the movement had picked up along the way, however, was the extreme diffusion of anarchist idea to the point where it was becoming difficult to define exactly who was and who was not an anarchist. Liu Shifu set out to remedy that situation in a series of articles in Peoples Voice, which attacked Jiang Kanghu, Sun Yat-Sen, and the Pure Socialists. The debates that ensued served for the first time to really crystallize what exactly was meant by anarchism in the broad sense. These articles were generally friendly in tone. The goal was to clearly differentiate between the different schools of thought that were available at that time. The letters directed at Sun Yet Sen and the Nationalists were aimed at exposing the ambiguities of their use of the word \\"socialism\\" to describe their goals, which were clearly not socialist according to any contemporary definition. The attacks on Jiang and the CSS sought to portray their vision of revolution and socialism as too narrow because it was focused on a single country, and to oppose their retention of market relations as part of their platform. The attack on the Pure Socialists was by far the mildest, with the main criticism being that if they were anarchists then they should call themselves anarchists and not socialists. Peoples Voice invited and printed responses from all parties, and their goal seems to have been the creation of an open and respectful debate among friends. For the next five years the movement would grow slowly but steadily as each of the disparate groups continued their propaganda, education, and organizing projects. In 1915 the anarchist arguments for a Social Revolution that had originated a decade earlier with the original Paris group would find broader acceptance in the New Culture Movement which was pioneered by a small group of intellectuals in Beijing but spread to the rest of the county over the next four years, until it merged into the May Fourth movement. The New Culture Movement was not anarchist, but in its glorification of science and extreme disdain for Confucianism and traditional culture it extended critiques that had originated with the Paris group, and the proliferation of anarchist thought during this period can be seen as a confirmation of the influence anarchists had on the movement from its foundation on. The participants saw it as a conscious attempt to create a Chinese renaissance, and consciously sought to create and live the new culture that they espoused. Decline in influence and the rise of Maoism In 1919 the May 4th Movement swept the country, with anarchism a major influence and anarchists in prominent positions. It was at this time that the first Bolsheviks started organising in China and began contacting anarchist groups for aid and support. The anarchists, unaware that Bolsheviks had taken control in the Soviets and would suppress anarchism, helped them set up communist study groups ‚Äì many of which were originally majority anarchist ‚Äì and introduced the Bolsheviks into the Chinese labor and student movements.Arif Dirlik, \\"Anarchism and Syndicalism in the Colonial and Postcolonial World, 1870-1940 Studies in Global Social History In 1921, the newly formed Communist Party of China (CPC) began to take influence from the anarchist movement. First, the anarchists, almost on principle, did not have the institutions or organization to coordinate activities across regions. Second, activists began to realize that the Bolsheviks were Marxists, not anarchists ‚Äì which caused a loss of prestige for the anarchists who had claimed the success of the Russian Revolution for their own. Third, and perhaps most critical, is that many anarchists expected their educational programs to work slowly, without short- term change; activists and workers who wanted immediate change turned to Bolshevism and the CPC. When the CPC entered into the First United Front with the Kuomintang against the warlords in 1924, they gained even broader access to the labor movement, and to mass movements in general. In a period of two years, the CPC grew from a membership of only a few hundred to over 50,000 through their support and assimilation of the various mass movements, leaving anarchists behind. =Hostilities between Chinese anarchism and Chinese communism= Where the first debates between Ou Shengbai and Chen Duxiu, his former teacher, had been friendly, later debates became actively hostile. Chen took the Marxist position that human nature was shaped by social and economic structures, and criticized Ou for his anarchist beliefs that human nature was good and people would be controlled by their sense of shame. The tension with communists was increased by anarchist criticisms of the Soviet Union. Reports from disillusioned anarchists had a big impact, such as Emma Goldman, who had many friends in China, and the wife of Kropotkin, who circulated first-hand reports of the failures of Bolshevism. A minority of anarchists, mostly from the Paris group, had been involved in the Kuomintang almost from its founding; but the majority of anarchists, in keeping with their stated principles against involvement in the exercise of coercive authority, had declined to participate in this alliance. The \\"Diligent Work-Frugal Study\\" program was one product of this collaboration of the anarchists with nationalists. When the Kuomintang purged the CPC from its ranks in 1927, the small minority of anarchists who had long participated in it urged their younger comrades to join the movement and utilize the Nationalist movement as a vehicle to defeat the Communists and realise anarchism. This drew immediate opposition from those anarchist groups that were still functioning. But even those critical of this opportunism, however, eventually joined in. The result of this last collaboration was Li Shizeng's creation in 1927 of National Labor University (Laodong Daxue) in Shanghai, which was intended to be a domestic version of the Paris group's educational program and sought to create a new generation of Labor Intellectuals who would finally overcome the gap between \\"those who work with their hands\\" and \\"those who work with their minds.\\" The university functioned for a few years before the Nationalist government decided the project was too subversive to allow it to continue and pulled funding. It had been acceptable for the anarchists to use government funding to promote anarchism as long as they did so in France, but when they began to do so at home, their \\"allies\\" were less than pleased. When the KMT initiated a second wave of repression against the few remaining mass movements, anarchists left the organization en masse and were forced underground as hostilities between the KMT and CPC ‚Äì both of whom were hostile towards anti-authoritarians ‚Äì escalated. Status today Overtly anarchist organizing has ceased to be a factor in modern Chinese politics due to the heavy repression levied against anti-authoritarians by the Maoist state since the time of the Cultural Revolution. However, as an underground resistance movement anarchism remains influential. Libertarian socialist and anarcho-communist currents have been particularly strong in the anti-dictatorship movement and in China's underground labor movement. The best known of these in the Western world is the Autonomous Beijing group, one of several groups responsible for organizing the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

Plot Young Chris Chandler, a student at Drake University, gets a new roommate, Dan, and becomes friends with him. Meanwhile, the fraternities are pledging and a student said to have been interested in Doma Tau Omega is found dead on the campus. Chris, who has no high opinion of fraternities, gets to know a student of psychology, Megan, who invites him and Dan to a party of Doma Tau Omega, saying that she does not want to go there alone. However, when they arrive at the party, Chris seems to be interested only in the leader of DTO, Devon Eisley, and approaches him. After waiting for Chris a long time, Megan and Dan leave the party. Chris, meanwhile, is made drunk by Devon, who then makes him a member of DTO by drinking a bit of his blood while, in turn, Chris has to drink a bit of Devon's. Shortly after that, Chris is introduced to parties in the DTO house, where he and Devon drink blood from a girl called Sandy in a way reminiscent of sexual intercourse. Dan is unsettled by the change in Chris since joining the fraternity, and breaks into the DTO house. Investigating the book of DTO, Dan is shocked to find photos of Devon throughout the decades of the fraternity's history, completely unchanged. He persuades Megan to go with him to Chris' room, which they find totally ravaged. They decide to look for Chris at the fraternity house. At the DTO house, Devon tells Chris that he lives eternally as long as he transforms his soul into a new body every century, and that this time, Chris would be the one whose body is used. The student found dead on campus was made to commit suicide, as he was afraid to participate in the ceremony and threatened to go public. Chris tries to flee but is knocked out by the other DTO members, Barry and Jordan. Dan and Megan try to enter the fraternity house, but their way is blocked by DTO member Mikhail who threatens them with an axe. Dan grabs the needle used by the fraternity members to get blood from their victims and thrusts in into Mikhail's neck, killing him. In the house, Dan and Megan meet Berry, Jordan, Devon and Chris, who are already beginning the ceremony. Megan reveals herself as a decoy who has worked for Devon over the last 70 years and was tasked with luring Chris. She threatens Dan with the axe, saying that she will kill him if Chris tries to resist the ritual. Chris stops fighting and kneels down in front of Devon. While everyone is concentrating on Chris, Dan suddenly breaks free of Megan. He takes the axe, and attacks Devon with it. Devon, the other fraternity members and Megan all die, leaving Chris and Dan standing amongst the carnage. Dan asks why Chris did not die, and Chris answers, \\"I told you I would never join a fraternity.\\" The two leave the house.

It is Irem's first attempt in the modern beat 'em up genre that was founded by Data East‚Äôs Kung-Fu Master. Players control \\"city sweepers\\", a police agent-like group who fight crime by taking down thugs in New York City in the year 2043. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. The video game is notable for its detailed backgrounds and grimy futuristic setting. For its time, it was relatively gory, featuring crow- pecked skeletons in the midst of its urban wastelands and forcing players to lose a life by being crushed by a garbage compactor during the first boss battle. While the gameplay is inspired by Final Fight, some of the enemies are unique. Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead such as burning oil drums, steel girders, long concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and fish. The characters eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health (many people in Japanese society eat these for their nutritional value but also attribute the development team's sense of humor later seen in the Metal Slug series.). The Japanese arcade version differs from the World version in several respects. The characters have a number of moves not seen in the World version, including dash + jump attacks, up to two different kinds of throws, and a powerful airborne special attack. The backgrounds and graphics are also different, especially at the start of Level Two and the end of Level Three. The music in the Japanese version has a more electronic feel and includes more voice samples. Some enemies carry broken bottles, knives and axes (in the World version these are replaced by planks and clubs). The mole creatures are weaker, taking only one hit to kill. Players' jump attacks do less damage, but their wider range of attacks makes them much more versatile. The appearance and functions of the police car seen at the end of Undercover Cops exactly resembles the appearance and functions of the tank from Moon Patrol, another arcade game by Irem. The boss from Stage 1 of the first R-Type, also by Irem, can be seen on the screens of some red television sets. Undercover Cops was later advertised on a blimp seen in the arcade flyers of Irem's other beat 'em up, Ninja Baseball Bat Man. Characters Playable characters: * (known in the US version as Claude) - a scruffy Japanese former karate master who was banned from formal tournaments after killing a man in self-defense. He is a well-rounded character and similar in effect to Rosa. He also has the ability to shoot multiple fireballs. * (known in the US version as Bubba) - an American ex- gridiron player turned city sweeper after being sent to rock bottom by a false accusation of murder. He is the most powerful but slowest character. However, he has the ability to run for a short period of time. Plus, he can dive through the ground when he uses his airborne attack. * (known in the US version as Flame) - a tough British blonde female vigilante whose lover, Thomas, was murdered by thugs. She is the fastest and easiest used character, making her good for beginners. She can send surrounding waves of energy if surrounded by enemies. Bosses: * (known in the US as Cue Ball) - a Terminator- like cyborg. He is the only boss who can be defeated in two ways: either normally or being crushed in a garbage compactor (players, however, must be careful during this boss battle because this can also happen to their character). * (known in the US as Fatso) - an obese, jackhammer-wielding dominatrix. She summons lesser enemies and cries when hit, and bawls more loudly when her life bar is half-empty. * (known in the US as Gunpuncher) - the heavily armed leader of the mole creatures who utters simple Japanese phrases. He is armed with a machine gun and explosives. * (known in the US as Cone Head) - a crazed carnival freak with a metal claw, who attacks with a wide range of concealed weapons. * - the main antagonist in the game. He is a small, bespectacled scientist who transforms into a giant monster. He is confronted by the three protagonists near the end of the final stage before the final battle. Home version Undercover Cops was later ported to the Super Famicom by the company Varie. An American localization was planned, but canceled. The unreleased American version was reviewed in Vol. 58 of Nintendo Power. In the Super Famicom version, the player can adjust the number of lives and credits, as well as the skill setting. However, there is no two-player mode. Playing \\"Easy\\" mode only gets the player to the end of the third level, after which the game ends, giving the player a stern message in Japanese, then asking him in English to try the next level (normal). A noticeable difference is the appearance of the common female enemy Fox, whose breasts are visible after being knocked down in the arcade version. The console version slightly alters her shirt to be fully covered when knocked down. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Undercover Cops on their August 15, 1992 as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy Due to its small success in Japan, Undercover Cops also got its own manga by Waita Uziga, which was published in the Gamest Comics series by Shinseisha in 1993. The game was later followed by a Game Boy spin-off titled Undercover Cops: Hakaishin Garumaa, and a more accurate translation called , which retains the details of the original arcade version. A few years later after its release, a lot of the team (artists, programmers, composers, designers, etc.) who made Undercover Cops went on to form the Nazca Corporation, who created the Metal Slug game series. The team have also worked on the Hammerin' Harry series, Superior Soldiers, In the Hunt and GunForce 2.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers from 2004 through 2013, the Seattle Mariners in 2014 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2015. Hart was a two-time MLB All-Star, and also participated in the MLB Home Run Derby.  High school career  Prior to being drafted in the 11th round of the 2000 MLB Draft, Hart played for the Greenwood High School Gators in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Hart also played basketball for four years for the Gators for Coach Jason Couch. On the diamond, he played nearly every position, routinely in the middle infield and even pitching in relief for Coach Chris Decker. Hart's jersey is retired by Greenwood and hangs from the rafters in the school's gymnasium. Hart played American Legion Baseball and was named the program's Graduate of the Year for 2011.  Minor league career  Hart started his career in 2000 with the Rookie League Ogden Raptors, primarily playing at first base. He moved up to the single-A High Desert Mavericks and then the double-A Huntsville Stars by the season; defensive problems caused Hart to be moved to the outfield. Playing there, he moved up to the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians by 2004. In 2005, Hart batted .308 with 17 home runs and 69 RBIs in 113 games for the triple-A Nashville Sounds. While there, Hart played alongside future major league teammates Prince Fielder and JJ Hardy. He also had 31 stolen bases, a relatively unusual feat for a player as tall as the Hart. Hart continued to play in both the minor and major leagues through 2006, and was regarded as one of Milwaukee's top prospects.  Major league career  =Milwaukee Brewers= Hart made his MLB debut with the Brewers on May 25, 2004. Hart's next appearance in the majors was Sunday, August 14, 2005, when he hit his first career MLB home run, a three-run blast against the Cincinnati Reds into the Upper Deck at Miller Park. Hart played 87 games for the major league club in 2006 and was with the Brewers for the entire 2007 season, mainly seeing action in right-field. Hart also led off for the Brewers for almost half of the 2007 season when second baseman Rickie Weeks was on the disabled list. May 29, 2010 Hart hit his first major league grand slam. In that game against the Mets he had two home runs. During spring training prior to the 2007 season, Hart, who stands at , recorded the fastest 60 yard dash of any player on the Brewers roster. During the 2007 season, Hart had a 22-game hitting streak which was finally snapped in a July 7 game against the Washington Nationals, as Hart went 0‚Äì4 with a walk. In 2007, Hart became the first Brewer since 2003 to steal 20 bases and hit 20 home runs in a single season. As of September 2011, he and Ryan Braun were the only two Brewers to have two 20-steals/20-homers seasons in their careers. In 2008, Hart was selected as an outfielder to the National League team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All- Star Game, which took place on July 15 at Yankee Stadium. He was voted in by the fans as a final vote in which he beat out David Wright of the Mets as well as Pat Burrell of the Phillies, Aaron Rowand of the Giants, and Carlos Lee of the Astros (a former Brewer himself). On August 30, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Hart became the first Brewers player in team history to have back to back 20‚Äì20 seasons. Hart reached base on an error 14 times in 2008, more than any other batter in the NL. Hart hit three home runs in three consecutive plate appearances against the Mets on May 28‚Äì29, 2010. The home runs included his first career walk off home run on May 28 and first career grand slam on May 29. In July 2010, Hart was voted by his peers to not only play in the All-Star Game in Anaheim, but also was selected by MLB officials to participate in the Home Run Derby. Hart's at-bat music is 'Until the Whole World Hears' by Casting Crowns. He is also the drummer of Milwaukee rock legends Deep Tuna. In July 2010, San Diego Padres Manager Bud Black had a friendly conversation with Hart at the 2010 State Farm Home Run Derby. Bud Black told him that many of the home runs he hit at the home run derby would be home runs at Petco Park. Bud Black and the Padres had interest in getting Hart. Hart had a breakout season in 2010 statistically. As the regular Brewers right fielder, he posted a career best 31 home runs, 102 RBIs, and a .283 batting average. Along with Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, and Casey McGehee, the Brewers had one of the best top five slots in the MLB. On May 23, 2011, Hart tied the Brewers records for home runs in a game with three and RBIs with seven. Hart had another productive regular season with the Brewers in 2011, posting 26 home runs, and 63 RBIs with a .285 batting average, .386 OBP, and .866 OPS. Hart's drop in home runs and RBIs is a result of missing the first month of the season with an injury, and being moved to bat first in the order in July, limiting the number of RBI chances he had. Hart remained first in the batting order in the playoffs due to his success in the slot during the regular season. Hart started the 2012 season as the Brewers regular right fielder, but injuries to Brewers first basemen Mat Gamel and Travis Ishikawa resulted in Hart becoming the Brewers regular first baseman, where he ended up having a successful season, recording a .995 fielding percentage playing in over 100 games at first base. On April 7, 2012, while hitting 5th against the St. Louis Cardinals, Hart went 2-for-3 with three RBIs and two home runs. It was his 12th multi-home run game. Hart had a productive offensive season with the Brewers in 2012, batting .270 with 30 home runs and 83 RBIs. Hart had surgery on his left knee in January 2013, and missed the entire 2013 season. =Seattle Mariners= Hart with the Seattle Mariners On December 11, 2013, Hart agreed to a one-year, $6 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. The deal contained up to $7 million in incentives. He was designated for assignment on September 29, 2014. =Pittsburgh Pirates= The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Hart to a one-year, $2.5 million contract on December 19, 2014. Hart retired from professional baseball after the 2015 season.Happily retired Hart would love to coach Crew =Retirement with the Milwaukee Brewers= On June 27, 2017, it was announced that Hart would retire from Major League Baseball as a Milwaukee Brewer after being honored at Miller Park on June 30 with a plaque on the park's Wall of Honor. A two-time All-Star, Hart spent nine of his 11 Major League seasons with the Brewers, batting .276 with 154 HR, 508 RBI and 83 stolen bases in 945 games. He had five 20-home-run seasons in Milwaukee, tied with four others for third- most in franchise history. Among the 38 players who have collected at least 2,000 plate appearances in a Brewers uniform, his .491 slugging percentage ranks sixth all-time. =Career Statistics= In 1048 games over 11 seasons, Hart compiled a .271 batting average (1009-for-3729) with 549 runs, 221 doubles, 33 triples, 162 home runs, 538 RBI, 85 stolen bases, 286 walks, .329 on-base percentage and .478 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage playing all three outfield positions and first base. In the postseason, in 14 playoff games, Hart batted .241 (13-for-54) with 6 runs, 2 home runs and 5 RBI.  Personal  Hart returns home to Bowling Green whenever possible and is active with local charities. Corey is the son of Johnnie and the late Donna Hart and has two sisters, Tabitha (older) and Ali (younger). He has said that he would be either a teacher or coach if he were not a baseball player. Hart is a Christian.

It is set in India during World War II as the influence of the British erodes. The novel focuses on old Raj family, the Laytons, the aftermath of the Mayapore incident focused on in The Jewel in the Crown, the Indian politician Mohammed Ali Kasim, and events in the princely state of Mirat. Plot introduction The novel is set in British India of the 1940s. it follows on from the storyline in The Jewel in the Crown. Much of the novel is written in the form of interviews and reports of conversations and research from the point of view of a narrator. Other portions are in the form of letters from one character to another or entries in their diaries. =Setting= The story is set in the period 1942-1944 in several locations in India, particularly in a northern province. The province shares characteristics with Punjab and the United Provinces. The names of places and people suggest a connection to Bengal; however, the physical characteristics place the setting in north-central India, rather than in northeast India. The province has an agricultural plain and, in the north, a mountainous region. The capital of the province is Ranpur. Another large city in the province is Mayapore, which was the key setting in The Jewel in the Crown. The princely state of Mirat is a nominally sovereign enclave within the province. Pankot is a \\"second-class\\" hill station in the province that serves as a headquarters for the 1st Pankot Rifles, a regiment of the Indian Army, who fought the Axis in North Africa. During the cool season, the regiment moves to Ranpur, on the plains. At Premanagar there is an old fortification that is used by the British as a prison. Another town, Muzzafirabad, is the headquarters of the Muzzafirabad (\\"Muzzy\\") Guides, another Indian Army regiment. Sundernagar is a \\"backwater town\\" in the province. Another hill station is in the Nanoora Hills. Plot summary In this novel an old Raj family comes newly on the scene, the Laytons of Pankot, an imaginary hill station in India. Now an army captain, Ronald Merrick, a self-made man of the lower middle class and the former police official in charge of the Daphne Manners case, begins to insinuate himself subtly into the Layton family. We learn what the Laytons do not know, that in a searing session with the incarcerated Hari Kumar, Merrick tortured and molested him. Susan, the younger Layton sister, driven by a sense of her own nothingness, marries Teddie Bingham, a colourless and conventional officer in the prestigious Pankot Rifles regiment. By accident, Teddie and Merrick are roommates, and when his designated best man falls ill at the last minute, Teddie asks Merrick to act as best man. The wedding is held in Mirat, a native state ruled by a Nawab. On the way to the wedding ceremony, someone throws a stone at the car in which Teddie and Merrick are riding. Teddie is injured and has to be patched up. At the wedding reception, the Nawab of Mirat becomes a victim of heightened security when he is denied entrance to his own property as he is an Indian. When the newlyweds are being seen off at the railway station, Shalini Gupta Sen appears and makes a scene, beseeching Merrick. She is later revealed to be begging Merrick to reveal the whereabouts of her nephew, Hari Kumar. Nigel Rowan, an officer serving in the civil service, takes Lady Manners to observe the debriefing of Hari Kumar, who was tortured and jailed after the rape of Lady Manners's niece, Daphne, and who has been held in prison for a year under the Defence of India Act for vague alleged political crimes. The panel, consisting of Rowan and V. R. Gopal, is horrified to learn of Hari's treatment at Merrick's hands. It comes out that Hari has never been informed that Daphne conceived a child and then died. The questioners realize that Hari's statements will be too inflammatory in the fragile political climate of India. They also realize that Hari is innocent, however, and suspect that at some point in the future, he will be quietly released from custody. Teddie and Merrick are sent to the front in Manipur against the Japanese and their surrogates, the Indian National Army (known as \\"Jiffs\\" among the British). Teddie, against Merrick's warnings, falls victim to an INA ambush while trying to induce INA soldiers from his regiment to surrender. Merrick does his best to save Teddie, but is unsuccessful, and comes away horribly disfigured. Teddie goes forward, it is implied, because he is concerned about the methods Merrick might employ on the turncoats. Sarah Layton, the older sister, comes to the fore as the morally fine-tuned mainstay of the family. To show the family's gratitude for his efforts, Sarah visits Merrick in Calcutta, where he is convalescing at an Army hospital. Merrick explains to her why he believes himself partly responsible for Teddie's fate. She is horrified by his disfigurement and learns that much of Merrick's left arm is to be amputated. While in Calcutta, Sarah is staying with Aunt Fenny, who is eager to get Sarah matched up with a young man. She gets her husband, Uncle Arthur, to bring several of his junior officers over for dinner. In particular, she is enthusiastic about introducing Sarah to Jimmy Clark. After an unsuccessful evening on the town, Clark takes Sarah to the Indian side of Calcutta, where they attend a party at the home of a wealthy socialite. There, Clark seduces Sarah by challenging her to taste life. On her way back to Pankot, Sarah encounters Count Bronowsky, a White Russian emigre who is the Nawab's wazir or chief advisor, whom she had met during Susan and Teddie's wedding. With him is Nigel Rowan. They are there to meet Mohammed Ali Kasim, a prominent politician who is being released after a period of imprisonment under the Defence of India Act. Kasim learns from his younger son, Ahmed, that his elder son, Sayed, an officer in the Indian Army, has become turncoat and joined the INA and now faces charges of treason. Barbie Batchelor, the friend and paying guest of Mabel Layton discovers the secret of the enmity between Mabel and Mildred one night when both the elderly women are unable to sleep. Mabel also tells Barbie she will never go to Ranpur again until after she is buried, which Barbie interprets to mean that she wishes be buried next to the grave of her late husband, James Layton, in Ranpur. Susan Bingham, Teddie's newlywed and pregnant bride, is unhinged when having received news of Teddie's death she witnesses her aunt Mabel's death. As it is, Susan depends on others to define her role and character. Without Teddie to serve as the anchor for her identity, Susan is lost and afraid to be responsible for a fatherless child. Coming unhinged, she makes a ring of fire with paraffin and places the baby with it, in imitation of a native treatment of scorpions that she witnessed as a child. The baby is rescued unharmed by its nurse. Characters in The Day of the Scorpion =Capt. Ronald Merrick= Merrick‚Äôs fears, desires, ambitions, and hatreds are the catalyst for this story and the stories of the subsequent two novels in the series. Merrick comes from a working-class background and keenly feels his inferior position in British society. In India, he finds a place where he can be on top, and he has developed a sophisticated justification for a virulent brand of racism. Merrick strongly believes that whites are the natural rulers of the world and non-whites must be made subject to them. He also believes that non-whites cannot ever improve their position and that they must be reminded of this. For his own part, however, Merrick seeks to climb the ladder of British society. He is intelligent, competent, and ruthless in both his quests: to keep Indians in their place and to improve his own social rank. Merrick uses the appearance of frankness and honesty as a tool to impress his social betters. He often reminds them that he is \\"only a grammar school boy\\" and not, for example, the product of an exclusive school like Chillingborough. Merrick was the district superintendent of police in Mayapore when Daphne Manners was raped. He was admired for his efficiency and skill at his job, but his notoriety after the Manners case (and his sadistic treatment of Hari Kumar, which was never revealed to the public) resulted in his transfer to Sundernagar, a backwater town in the unnamed province. Seeing his opportunity to advance in the civil service frustrated, Merrick calls in his chips to get a commission in the Indian Army at the rank of captain. Other characters in the story become important when Merrick \\"chooses\\" them for his personal attention. He chooses the Layton family as an opportunity to climb the social ladder. He gets his opportunity after befriending Teddie Bingham. When it becomes clear that Bingham's regiment will soon be sent into battle against the Japanese, Merrick helps Bingham arrange a quick wedding through his contacts with the government of the Nawab of Mirat. When Bingham's best man falls ill, Merrick is rewarded for his troubles with the honor of the role of substitute best man. From this point on, he insinuates himself into the Laytons' lives. Although Merrick desperately wants to join the upper classes, as personified by the Laytons, he is contemptuous of their \\"romantic\\" attitudes towards Indians and India. From Merrick's point of view, it is a simple matter of political subjugation that must be met head on. People like Teddie Bingham, however, see themselves in a familial role, with the British officers of the Indian Army as parent (maa- bap, \\"mother and father\\") to loyal Indian soldiers. This dispute between Merrick and Bingham leads Bingham to fall victim to an INA ambush. Merrick does his best to save Bingham, but is grievously injured, and again becomes a hero in the eyes of the British in India. People from Bingham's class are amateurs‚Äîprivileged dilettantes‚ÄîMerrick believes, in contrast with his professionalism, and, from his perspective, Bingham \\"died an amateur.\\" With Bingham's death, however, Merrick comes to understand something about his old- fashioned views and he connects to his experience with Edwina Crane, who was attacked by a mob when Merrick was the district police superintendent in Mayapore. =Mohammed Ali Kasim= Kasim, known in the popular press as \\"M.A.K.,\\" is an Indian politician and one of the few remaining Muslim members of the Indian National Congress. Kasim was formerly the chief minister of an unnamed province, until the Congress decided to boycott the elections. At the beginning of the story, Kasim is arrested under the Defence of India Act, when the Congress votes to oppose the entry of the Indian Army into the Second World War. Kasim is a principled man and he strives to live his life according to those principles. He wants independence for India, but he believes in a secular, undivided India, which puts him at odds with his fellow Muslim leaders, who want a separate state (Pakistan), and who have left the Congress to join the Muslim League. Kasim is a descendant of the 18th-century Urdu poet, Gaffur Mohammed, and, as such, he is a kinsman of the Nawab of Mirat. Kasim has two sons. The elder, Sayed Kasim, is an officer in the Indian Army. The younger, Ahmed Kasim, is an indolent playboy, who, in MAK's view, wastes his time in a sinecure as secretary to the Nawab. Several historical persons, such as Abul Kalam Azad, a prominent Muslim politician who stayed with the Congress and opposed partition, may serve as the basis for the character of Kasim. =Sarah Layton= Sarah is the elder daughter of Lt. Col. John Layton, the commanding officer of the 1st Pankot Rifles, and his wife, Mildred. While her father is held in a German prison camp in Europe, Sarah and her family continue to live the upper middle class life of the British in India. However, unlike the rest of her family, Sarah is uncomfortable with the hierarchy that the British have established in India. She is not so sure of the racial philosophy that forms the basis of British dominance in the subcontinent and she occasionally shocks her family with her deviance from accepted propriety. Sarah's meeting of Ahmed Kasim in Mirat, during her sister's wedding, in particular, sets her thinking about the relationship between Indians and British. Although they are of the same age and education, and, perhaps, in some sense, social class, she is keenly aware of the distance between them and the pains that Kasim takes to preserve that distance. However, Sarah's strength, independence, and competence are what keep things going in the Layton household, especially after the death of Susan's husband Teddie. For the duration of the war, Sarah (as well as her sister, Susan) has joined the Women Army Corps (India), and is serving in a clerical position at regimental headquarters in Pankot. She is seduced by Jimmy Clark and becomes pregnant. She has an abortion. Sarah eventually assumes the role of moral compass in the last half of the Raj Quartet, and often gives voice, perhaps, to Scott's own despair at the political and ethnic turmoil of India both before and after Independence. However she is ultimately and perhaps increasingly conventional, albeit endowed with personal qualities that make her stand out from the other women in Pankot. Although she has sympathy for outsiders like Barbie Batchelor and Lady Manners, this shows her honourable nature rather than implying a desire to oppose convention. Likewise, because she is thoughtful and clear- sighted, she is willing to discuss controversial issues; but her own conduct seldom noticeably offends the established norms. Her character can therefore be contrasted with that of Daphne Manners in the previous novel of the quartet, The Jewel in the Crown. =Capt. Nigel Robert Alexander Rowan= Another former pupil of Chillingborough, Rowan, although an officer in the Indian Army, was assigned to work with H.E., Sir George, in a civil service capacity. When the war heated up, he was recalled up to serve in Burma, where he contracted a serious illness. Sent back to Sir George to recuperate, Rowan is trying to leave the army for a permanent place in the \\"political\\" service, the branch of the civil service that handles the relationship between the crown and the princely states, such as Mirat. Rowan remembers Hari Kumar from Chillingborough, as well as Kumar's friend Colin Lindsey, but Kumar doesn't seem to recognize him. This connection and his knowledge of the unjust treatment Kumar has suffered leads him to do what he can, anonymously, to restore Kumar to some kind of normal life. What Rowan learns at the interview of Hari Kumar shocks him, and he develops a loathing for Ronald Merrick. But he knows that it will be impossible, because of Merrick's popularity with the British, and because of the fragile political situation, that any of Merrick's doings will come to light. Instead, Merrick will be rewarded with a promotion. =Barbara Batchelor (Barbie)= Miss Batchelor is a retired missionary schoolteacher who lives with Mabel Layton at Rose Cottage. Barbie is a simple, down-to-earth woman, who believes strongly in her god and in Christianity and has clear ideas about right and wrong. She is troubled that in all her years of missionary work, she was not very successful in converting the children in her charge to Christianity (\\"How many of them did I bring to God?\\" she asks.) Above all, Barbie wants to be useful, wants to have a role in society. Barbie is haunted by the suicide of her friend and former colleague, Edwina Crane, who in The Jewel and the Crown was witness to a brutal murder during rioting \\"on the road from Dibrapur.\\" Barbie comes from a working-class background and this, as well as her taking up space in Rose Cottage, are cause for resentment on the part of Mildred Layton. Barbie's egalitarian attitudes, based on her communal Christian beliefs, are a source of annoyance and exasperation to Mildred. Barbie is a figure of fun among the best of Pankot's British society. They mock her and roll their eyes at what they view as her hysterics and spread rumors that she is a lesbian. However, Sarah Layton, especially, and her sister Susan have affection for her. =Ahmed Kasim= Ahmed is the younger son of Mohammed Ali Kasim and the personal secretary to the Nawab of Mirat. He claims not to be interested in politics, or in Europeans. His job does not tax his abilities, and he spends his free time womanizing and drinking. He is a sensitive and pleasant man, but he does not know how to relate to the British. His assignment as Sarah Layton's escort one afternoon leaves him unsure how to behave. =Mabel Layton (Aunty Mabel)= Mabel Layton is the stepmother of Colonel Layton and the owner of Rose Cottage in Pankot. Mabel is very close to her stepson and his daughters, who address her as \\"Aunty Mabel.\\" Layton's houseguest and companion is the retired missionary schoolteacher, Barbie Batchelor. Mildred Layton, her stepson's wife, resents her for occupying Rose Cottage and for bringing the working-class Miss Batchelor into their lives. But Mabel knows the real reason for Mildred's resentment. In 1919, after the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre in Amritsar, when most of the British in India were contributing to fund the retirement of Reginald Dyer, who was responsible for the massacre, Mabel contributed money to the fund for the Indian victims of the massacre. As a result, Mildred sees Mabel as a traitor to her own people. =Count Dmitri Bronowsky= Bronowsky, a lame √©migr√© Russian, serves as the wazir, or chief minister, to the Nawab of Mirat. Much of Bronowsky's background is mysterious. It is thought that his title, \\"count,\\" is genuine, but it is not certain. It is said he fled Russia after the defeat of the White Movement. He is a clever and efficient operator, and he sees much in common with Ronald Merrick. As a homosexual himself, Bronowsky recognizes this trait in Merrick, even though Merrick struggles to repress this aspect of his personality. Unlike Merrick, however, Bronowsky has more of the humanist in him; he does not have Merrick's sadistic tendencies. Merrick on the other hand despises Bronowsky as a sensualist. The two men have a tense rapport, understanding each other better than anyone else does, while also finding each other's inclinations repulsive. Bronowsky has great affection for the Nawab, as well as the Nawab's secretary, Ahmed Kasim. Bronowsky also has affection for Sarah Layton. In Bronowski's eyes, all these people share the trait of being isolated from their own societies. =Mildred Layton (nee Muir)= Mildred is the wife of Colonel Layton and the mother of Sarah and Susan. As the daughter of a general and the wife of a colonel, she is very comfortable with her place in society and her class status and enforces her authority without hesitation. She keenly resents the presence of the low-class Barbie Batchelor in their midst, and has harboured a long-term resentment of her husband's stepmother, Mabel. With her husband held as a prisoner of war in Germany, Mildred has developed a heavy drinking habit. As Ahmed Kasim reports to Bronowsky, \\"[S]he begins first, finishes last and has two drinks to anybody else's one.\\" Her behavior is erratic. Mildred is the eldest of three sisters, the second sister being Fenella Grace. The youngest sister, Lydia, married and has \\"returned to England.\\" =Susan Layton= Susan, the younger sister of Sarah Layton, is of a more superficial character and sees herself only as reflected in the eyes of others. She is engaged to be married to Captain Bingham. Despite, or perhaps because, of her personal emptiness, Susan is keen to the needs of others. A crisis of etiquette arises at her wedding reception, when the Nawab of Mirat is detained by guards at the entrance of the officers' club in the British military cantonment. Susan instinctively makes up for the insult by curtseying before the Nawab and greeting him as a sovereign, even though, as a British subject, she owes him no such honor. =Capt. Edward Arthur David Bingham (Teddie)= Bingham, a young officer in the Muzzy Guides, is engaged to be married to Susan Layton. He is a bit scatterbrained and not the best example of his class, but he is honorable and possesses the sense of chivalry expected of him. Teddie comes to depend upon Ronald Merrick when it becomes necessary to hasten his wedding in order to be married before being sent into battle against the Japanese. When his intended best man, Capt. Tony Bishop, comes down with jaundice and cannot attend the wedding, Susan suggests that Merrick is worthy enough to take Captain Bishop's place. Teddie develops resentment towards Merrick, beginning with the incident at the railway station when Shalini Gupta Sen accosts them. Later, Teddie resents Merrick's cynicism regarding the traditionally close pseudo-parental relationship between British officers and Indian soldiers. An effort to prove Merrick wrong leads to Teddie's death on the front lines in Imphal. =Nawab of Mirat= The Nawab, unusual for an Indian prince, is an abstemious man, avoiding excessive displays of wealth and preferring to dress in simple, worn clothes to the extent that one Englishwoman describes him as a \\"downtrodden munshi.\\" He had an adventurous youth and needed Count Bronowsky's help to disengage from a romantic entanglement that had taken the Nawab to Monte Carlo. Since then, the Nawab has relied on Bronowsky's counsel and has appointed him his Wazir. The Nawab has a poetic bent and admires the work of a collateral ancestor, the eighteenth century classic Urdu poet Mohammed Gaffur. The poet was the same family as the present Nawab at the time this book is set. In other words, he was a Kasim. Therefore, he is kinsman to Mohammed Ali Kasim (MAK), the imprisoned politician. The Nawab strives to do the right thing in administering his Princely state of Mirat. There is a British non- resident Resident in Gopalkind, another state. He worries about the future of his state and of India as a whole. He generously allows the Layton family to stay for Susan's wedding to Teddie Bingham in the Guest House in the grounds of his wonderful Palace in the State of Mirat. But he is mistakenly refused entry to the wedding reception in the European Club because of his colour. This causes the Laytons much embarrassment and Susan Layton has the presence of mind to greet the Nawab and take him into the Club herself thus smoothing over the faux pas. His Summer Palace is in the Nanoora Hills, Mirat. =Fenella Grace (nee Muir) (Aunt Fenny)= Fenny is the younger sister of Mildred Layton. She is more outgoing and fun-loving than Mildred. She was and perhaps still is in love with Mildred's husband Colonel Layton. She notices that Sarah doesn't seem to have quite the right attitude towards British administration of India and she worries that that puts off potential suitors, such as Teddie Bingham, who showed interest in Sarah before switching to Susan. When Fenny encounters Ronald Merrick, she is keenly interested in the gossip about the Manners case and expresses sympathy for Merrick, having seen the object of his affection being stolen away by an Indian. (\\"Fenny\\" or \\"feni\\" is also an Indian term for a type of intoxicating drink made from coconut or cashews.) =Ethel Manners (Lady Manners)= Lady Manners is the widow of Sir Henry Manners, a former governor of the unnamed province. In The Jewel in the Crown, her niece, Daphne Manners fell in love with an Indian, Hari Kumar. Daphne was the victim of a gang rape during a riot that became a cause celebre among the British in India and Kumar was arrested as a suspect. Unable to make the charge of rape stick, the government put Kumar in prison for political crimes. Daphne, who conceived a child, died during childbirth. Lady Manners takes the child, Parvati Manners, to Kashmir, where they stay in a houseboat on Dal Lake. There, she encounters the Laytons. Lady Manners seeks justice for Hari Kumar and does what she can to try to get him released. =Maj. James Clark (Jimmy, Clark-Without)= Jimmy Clark is another graduate of Chillingborough, but he has a different perspective than such men as Nigel Rowan or Guy Perron. Clark hates the British aristocracy in India, seeing them as dull and unobservant and living in the past. He takes advantage of his postings around the world to experience new cultures, and, especially, to have as much sex as possible. His method of seduction is straightforward, taking the attitude that sex is something that everyone really likes, so why not just do it? Under Clark's theory, denying oneself sensual pleasures only leads to unhappiness and disorders like alcoholism (In his words, \\"getting your screws from a bottle\\"). He takes Sarah Layton, who has come to Calcutta to visit the hospitalized Ronald Merrick, to the Indian side of Calcutta and seduces her in the home of a wealthy socialite, the ex Maharanee of Kotala. =Capt. Kevin Coley= Coley is the adjutant for the 1st Pankot Rifles. He is rather too old for his position and his lack of ambition in seeking an assignment elsewhere puzzles Pankot society. His secret is that he has stuck around because he is having an affair with Mildred Layton, the wife of the commanding officer of the Rifles, who is interned in a German prisoner-of-war camp. =His Excellency, Sir George Malcolm= Sir George is the governor appointed by the crown to the unnamed province. =Vallabhai Ramaswamy Gopal (V. R. Gopal)= Gopal is a civil servant on Sir George's staff. Together with Nigel Rowan, he examines Hari Kumar. =Hari Kumar= Hari Kumar is an Indian raised as an Englishman and who attended the exclusive public school, Chillingborough. When his father dies unexpectedly he returns, impoverished, to India. Hari finds himself an alien among the Indians and the British, until he meets an Englishwoman, Daphne Manners, with whom he falls in love. His affair with Daphne ends tragically when she is gang-raped by a rioting mob and he is held as a chief suspect by Ronald Merrick. The police are unable to make the rape charges stick. Nonetheless, they haul Kumar off to Kandipat Jail as a political subversive. =Lt. Col. John Layton= Colonel Layton is the commanding officer of the 1st Pankot Rifles, headquartered in Pankot and Ranpur. He is also the patriarch of the Layton family. He is the product of Chillingborough, the same exclusive school that Hari Kumar and the brother of Daphne Manners attended. As the Laytons enter the story, John Layton is being held prisoner by the Germans after being captured in the North Africa theater of war. =Maj./Lt. Col. Arthur Grace (Uncle Arthur)= Major Grace is the husband of Aunt Fenny and is an officer in the educational corps, stationed in Calcutta, where he is promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. =Pandit Baba= \\"Pandit Baba\\" is the alias of a man who has connections with Indian nationalists. A devout Hindu, Pandit Baba is respected in the Indian community of Mirat and elsewhere. Having been present in Mayapore during the riots, the rape of Daphne Manners, and the brutal treatment of Hari Kumar and his fellows, Pandit Baba has made it his mission to take revenge on Ronald Merrick. Merrick occasionally finds signs of Pandit Baba's scrutiny, but he can do nothing to act against him. Pandit Baba lectures Ahmed Kasim on the importance of preserving his Indian cultural identity and criticizes him for speaking only English and wearing western clothes. =Mr. Maybrick= Mr. Maybrick is the organist at the church in Pankot and a friend of Barbie Batchelor. Critical reception A 1968 book review in Kirkus Reviews, an anonymous reviewer called the novel a \\"rich, elaborately terraced novel.\\" The review summarized that Scott's \\"view of the crippling illusionary quests of men and nations, his ability to recreate a culture and a time, continue to mark him as a novelist of importance.\\" References 1968 British novels British historical novels Novels by Paul Scott Novels set in British India Fiction set in the 1940s Heinemann (publisher) books Nonlinear narrative novels ","title":"The Day of the Scorpion"},{"id":"4977693","text":"El Diario is a newspaper of Bolivia, published in La Paz.

A Republican, she was a member of the Tennessee Senate for the 17th district from 2003 until she resigned to run for governor in August 2017. The 17th district is composed of Cannon, Clay, DeKalb, Macon, Smith, and Wilson counties. Prior to becoming a state senator, Beavers was a state representative in the 99th through the 102nd General Assemblies. She was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Tennessee in the 2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election. Early life Mae Beavers was born on December 11, 1947, in Millport, Alabama. She graduated from Trevecca Nazarene University, where she received a bachelor of science degree. She also attended the Nashville School of Law, and worked as a court reporter and financial advisor. Political career Beavers has represented the Wilson County Commission (1990‚Äì1994), in the State House of Representatives (1994‚Äì2002), and in the State Senate (2002‚Äì2017). Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the Senate Ron Ramsey credited her first election to the State Senate as the beginning of the conversion of the suburbs of Nashville from Democratic allegiance to Republican allegiance. Former Democratic State Senator Bob Rochelle attempted to re-claim his seat and ran against Beavers in the 2006 general election, yet Beavers prevailed with approximately 58% of the vote. In 2010, Beavers defeated her long-time political rival, State Representative Susan Lynn, in the 2010 Republican primary, and defeated Democrat George McDonald with approximately 63% of the vote in the general election. Beavers opposes abortion and supports gun rights. She supported President Donald Trump's travel ban, supports abolition of state income taxation, and is a proponent of tougher laws and measures against illegal immigrants. Beavers has also supported legislation in opposition to the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. In 2014, Beavers was rated by the Sunlight Foundation as the second- most conservative state senator in Tennessee, behind then-senator Stacey Campfield. She also leads the Wilson County Conservatives. Beavers is a member of the National Rifle Association and a lifetime member of the Tennessee Firearms Association. On December 26, 2019, Beavers was appointed by Governor Bill Lee to serve on the state Board of Parole for a six-year term. =Sponsored legislation= Beavers was a proponent of the Tennessee Women's Ultrasound Right to Know Act, and sponsored SB 1769, SB 775, and co-sponsored SB 632, Both bills failed to pass. Beavers opposed the 2010 health care reform legislation proposals including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sponsoring instead the Tennessee Health Freedom Act in order to protect \\"a citizen's right to participate, or not participate, in any healthcare system\\". In September 2015, Beavers proposed bill SB1437, known as the Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense Act, to ban same-sex marriage in Tennessee despite the Supreme Court's decision to legalize it. Her colleague in the House, Mark Pody, proposed a similar bill. After just 90 minutes of testimony, the House Civil Justice Committee rejected that bill. Had the bill passed, it would have cost Tennessee upwards of $8.5 billion in federal funding, in addition to millions of dollars in legal bills, mostly impacting programs that support Tennessee families in need such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). In the next legislative session, Beavers and Pody reintroduced the bill, with specific language that no court decision (presumably including those of the Supreme Court of the United States) would affect it. 2018 gubernatorial and mayoral elections Beavers started her campaign for governor of Tennessee on June 3, 2017. She was the fourth Republican to announce his or her candidacy. In July 2017, Beavers' campaign raised $36,000. Her campaign was the third- most funded Republican campaign. The top two most-funded Republican campaigns were businessman Randy Boyd ($2.3 million) and businessman Bill Lee ($1.37 million). On August 23, 2017, Beavers announced she would resign her spot in the state senate to focus fully on her campaign. Mark Pody won a special election to assume Beavers' senate seat. On January 30, 2018, Beavers announced that she would be stepping out of the 2018 Tennessee gubernatorial race. In March 2018, Beavers announced her candidacy in the Wilson County mayoral election. She was defeated in this race, and was elected chair of the Wilson County Republican Party the following year. Personal life Beavers is married to Jerry Beavers, with whom she has two children. They attend Trevecca Community Church.

With the first project, Arctic Shores completed, the second phase, The Wander Trail, opened in 2013. Exhibits ; Inner Zoo: The Inner Zoo is the area of the zoo that was originally the Storyland Valley Zoo. The vast majority of the area was constructed in 1959. Animals that live within this area of the zoo during summer include: emus, kookaburras, keas, black swans, and skunks ; Makira Outpost: Makira Outpost is an exhibit which opened in the summer of 2007 and is home to the zoo's lemurs. The exhibit uses many exhibit methods. The lemurs have access to a large outdoor island with two large elm trees for climbing. It also has two outdoor enclosures that have zoomesh (a nearly invisible mesh). The indoor enclosures are huge and benefit from plentiful natural light. The animals housed in Makira outpost include: ring-tailed lemurs, African spurred tortoise, mongoose lemurs and ruffed lemurs. ; Nature's Wild Backyard: In 2019 the zoo opened phase one of Nature's Wild Backyard. Phase one includes a immersive exhibit for the zoos red panda as well as the year- round Urban Farm, home to numerous domestic species. In addition to the animal enclosures the Urban Farm has a restaurant, washrooms, and ice cream stand. Phase II of Nature's Wild Backyard is not completely funded. ; Carnivore Alley: The Carnivore Alley has the majority of the zoo's carnivores, such as red foxes, snow leopards, Amur tigers, Arctic wolves, Canadian lynx and African serval cat. ; Elephant House and Exhibit: The Valley Zoo's Elephant House is home to Lucy, a female Asian elephant who was orphaned in Sri Lanka in 1975 and came to the zoo at the age of two on May 19, 1977. ; Saito Centre: The Saito Centre is named after the zoo's former veterinarian who died shortly before construction of the building. Originally designed as a winter holding building, it now houses all the zoo's fragile animals. It is winter home to all the zoo's primate species as well. It is also home to the reptile and nocturnal wing, froggery (over ten species of amphibians), and many of the zoo's smaller animals.

Some species include bald eagle, peregrine falcon, and snowy owl. Controversy Lucy is a female Asian elephant currently residing at the Valley Zoo The residence of Lucy the elephant at the Valley Zoo has been controversial since 2009. Animal welfare groups such as ZoocheckZoocheck opposed keeping a lone elephant in a zoo, since elephants are a highly social species, and that Edmonton's cold climate is unhealthy for elephants. Groups like Zoocheck have said that Lucy exhibits psychological health issues, including lethargy and abnormal stereotypical behaviours, though these have not been confirmed by any animal healthcare professional. A number of North American zoos have phased out elephants, including the Toronto zoo when it moved three elephants in October 2013 to the United States. The Edmonton Valley Zoo argues that moving Lucy would be detrimental to her health, disclosing a known respiratory issue that is purportedly exacerbated by stress. Retired game show host and animal rights activist Bob Barker also advocated for Lucy's transfer.

It is one of the two important viral causes of respiratory infection in cats, the other being Felid alphaherpesvirus 1. FCV can be isolated from about 50% of cats with upper respiratory infections. Cheetahs are the other species of the family Felidae known to become infected naturally. Viral structure and pathogenesis Different strains of FCV can vary in virulence (the degree of pathogenicity within a group or species of microorganisms or viruses as indicated by case fatality rates and/or the ability of the organism to invade the tissues of the host). Being an RNA virus, FCV has a high elasticity of its genome, which makes it more adaptable to environmental pressures. This not only makes the development of vaccines more difficult, but also allows for the development of more virulent strains. In persistently infected cats, the gene for the major structural protein of the viral capsid (the outer protein coat of a mature virus) has been shown to evolve through immune-mediated positive selection, which allows the virus to escape detection by the immune system. A form of FCV has been found to cause a particularly severe systemic disease in cats, similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease (which is also caused by a calicivirus). This virus has been called virulent systemic feline calicivirus (VS-FCV) or FCV-associated virulent systemic disease (VSD). The disease is caused by direct viral invasion of epithelium and endothelium and secondary host immune response. Strains of VS- FCV have seemingly risen independently of one another since first being described, meaning that not all cases of VS-FCV have spread from a single case. Most of the outbreaks of VS-FCV have been reported in the United States. It was originally described in 1998 in Northern California. The prevalence of FCV varies depending on the environment. In private households, FCV is present in about 10% of cats (either in active or carrier state), while the prevalence in shelters or catteries is 25 to 40%. FCV replicates in the oral and respiratory tissues, and is secreted in saliva, feces, urine, and respiratory secretions. It can be transmitted through the air, orally, and on fomites. Infected cats usually shed the virus for two weeks. Following this period, infected cats never shed the virus again or become latently infected and shed the virus continuously or intermittently. Co-infection with either feline herpesvirus or feline immunodeficiency virus causes a more severe disease. Clinical signs ulceration over the rostral end of tongue and secondary gingivitis, faucitis and ptyalism. Note that rhinitis is also present. Clinical signs in cats infected with FCV may develop acutely, chronically, or not at all. Latent or subclinical infections often become clinical when the cat is stressed, such as at the time of adoption. Acute signs of FCV include fever, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, sneezing, and ulceration of the mouth (stomatitis). Pneumonia may develop with secondary bacterial infections. In addition to stomatitis, some cats may develop a polyarthritis, both probably immune-mediated through immune complex deposition. Stomatitis and polyarthritis can develop without any upper respiratory infection signs, but fever and loss of appetite may occur. Less commonly, glomerulonephritis can develop in chronic cases secondary to immune complex deposition. The great variability of clinical signs in individual cases of FCV is related to the relative virulence of different strains of the virus. VS-FCV can cause a rapid epidemic, with a mortality rate of up to 67%. Initial clinical signs include discharge from the eyes and nose, ulceration in the mouth, anorexia, and lethargy, and occur in the first one to five days. Later signs include fever, edema of the limbs and face, jaundice, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Diagnosis of FCV is difficult without specific tests, because the signs are similar to other feline respiratory diseases, especially feline viral rhinotracheitis. The presence of stomatitis may indicate FCV. Specific tests include virus culture, polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical staining. Treatment and prevention There is no specific treatment for FCV. Antibiotics are used for secondary bacterial infections, and immune modulators, such as lymphocyte T-cell immune modulator, have been used for immune support. Nursing care and rehydration are used for dehydrated and anorexic cats. Corticosteroids or azathioprine may be used for polyarthritis. Stomatitis is very difficult to treat. Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and tooth extractions all have been used with varying success. Cats on corticosteroids must be monitored carefully for worsening of any upper respiratory infection. Natural immunity from maternal antibodies lasts in the kitten from three to nine weeks. After that, kittens are susceptible to FCV. Previous infection does not guarantee lifelong immunity, since an antigenically dissimilar FCV (such as VS-FCV) can cause infection. However, usually after the age of three years, FCV infections are mild or asymptomatic. FCV vaccination will not always prevent disease, but can reduce the severity. FCV vaccines come in two types, inactivated (ATCvet code: ) and attenuated (live, but not virulent; in various combination vaccines). They have been shown to be effective for at least three years. Attenuated FCV vaccine has been shown to possibly cause mild upper respiratory infection. Inactivated vaccine does not, but it causes more local inflammation and possibly predisposes the cat to vaccine-associated sarcoma. The only vaccine licensed for prevention of VS-FCV is CaliciVax, manufactured by Fort Dodge Animal Health, a division of Wyeth. It also contains a strain of the traditional FCV virus. Since VS-FCV has arisen from variant strains of FCV, it is not certain that a vaccine for one virulent strain will protect against all virulent strains. Quarantine is best for control of FCV in catteries and kennels. However, FCV is very contagious, and latently infected cats will continue to shed viruses, so complete control is difficult. An outbreak of VS- FCV at a humane society in Missouri in 2007 led to the euthanasia of the entire cat population (almost 200 cats) to contain it. FCV may survive several days to weeks in a dry environment and longer in a cooler, wet environment. Quaternary ammonium compounds are not thought to be completely effective, but a 1:32 dilution of household bleach used with a detergent and sufficient contact time does seem to kill the virus. Herbal extracts as a source of compounds with an antiviral activity has attracted significant attention recently. Two researches independently published in 2016 screened a library of natural chemicals against FCV. The first one showed that Theaflavin and its derivatives but not Kaempferol significantly inhibited entry of FCV into cells. On the contrary, authors of the second article claimed that kaempherol showed anti-FCV activity, but theaflavin treatment was insufficient. This striking difference may be (at least partially) explained by differences in testing conditions. Indeed, further studies of activity, as well as molecular mechanisms of action, needed. Use in research Because of the similarity of FCV to norovirus, a common cause of gastroenteritis in humans, FCV has been used as a surrogate for it in research. For instance, studies have been done on the survival of FCV in foodstuffs, the effectiveness of handwashing on FCV removal, and the use of ozone gas to inactivate FCV found in hotel rooms, cruise ship cabins, and healthcare facilities. It is also used in general Caliciviridae research due to its being one of the few of that group of viruses that grows well in vitro.

Summary One of the units is patrolling the area around the white castle. This video game that takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army. Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens. Even though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai). All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing). Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent. Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over. Reception Allgame gave this video game a score of 2.5 points out of a possible 5 in their overview.

He also developed important methods for procuring heavy water during World War II and pioneered the use of stable isotopes in studying chemical reactions.(1975) Chem. Brit., 11, 370‚Äì371.Biographical sketch at Princeton  Early life  Taylor was born in St Helens, Lancashire, England in 1890, the son of glass technologist James and Ellen (n√©e Stott) Taylor. He was educated at Cowley Grammar School in St Helens and then attended the University of Liverpool, where he received his BSc in 1909 and his MSc in 1910. Taylor then carried out three years of graduate work in Liverpool, after which he spent one year at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm in the laboratory of Svante Arrhenius and another at the Technische Hochschule in Hanover under Max Bodenstein. These studies earned him a PhD degree from the University of Liverpool in 1914.  Basic research  Taylor showed that chemisorption may be an activated process, and occur slowly. Moreover, he conceived the idea that chemically active sites might be sparse on the surface of a catalyst and, hence, could be inhibited with relatively few molecules. Taylor showed that hydrogen atoms are key intermediates of reactions involving H2 on metal surfaces and also discovered the conversion of heptane to toluene over chromium oxide.  Protein structure  Taylor and a graduate student developed the first semi- realistic model of the Œ±-helix, an element of protein secondary structure. An earlier model by Astbury had been shown to be physically implausible by Hans Neurath. Using physical models and chemical reasoning, Taylor sought to find a better model, which differs only slightly from the modern Œ±-helix proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey. Taylor reported their models at his Franklin Medal lecture (1941) and in press (1942).  Work at Princeton  Taylor began at Princeton in 1914 as instructor in Physical Chemistry, and by 1915, was made an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1922 and became chair of the Chemistry Department at Princeton in 1926, where he served until 1951. In 1927, Taylor became the David B. Jones Professor of Chemistry at Princeton. Taylor also served as the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton from 1948 to 1958. As Chair of Chemistry from 1926 to 1951, Taylor developed the Chemistry Dept. at Princeton energetically and oversaw the construction of the Frick Chemical Laboratory. He received the American Chemical Society's Remsen Award in the year of his retirement. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1932.  Personal life  He married Elizabeth Agnes Sawyer on 12 June 1919; They had two daughters. Taylor was knighted by both Pope Pius XII and Queen Elizabeth II. The Hugh Stott Taylor Chair of Chemistry at Princeton was funded by an anonymous gift of $500K in honour of Taylor's contributions to Princeton. Taylor was a devoted Catholic who helped to establish the Catholic chaplaincy at Princeton in 1928 and spoke publicly about the reconciliation of science and faith. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (Papal) and a Commander of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium.

The league was an independent Junior ice hockey league that did not operate under USA Hockey. There were later plans for a new league to begin play in the 2012-2013 season as a Tier II Junior league. The new Continental Elite Hockey League planned to have five to six teams ready to play in the league's first season. League History The Continental Elite Hockey League was a Junior A league that existed from 2001 - 2004\\\\. The league did not operate under the auspices of USA Hockey as all other significant Junior leagues in the United States do. This led many to refer to the CEHL as the \\"rebel league,\\" which may have contributed to the quick decline. Hockey Weekly and Michigan Hockey joined newspapers around Michigan and Ohio in announcing the formation of a controversial new independent Junior A-level hockey league for the 2001-02 season. The Continental Elite Hockey League (CEHL) played three seasons without any affiliation with USA Hockey to create opportunities for 21-year-olds. Using many Canadians on rosters allowed the CEHL to create a strong league. The CEHL championships were won by the Detroit Lightning, Toledo Jr. Storm and New Jersey's Metro Moose. The Traverse City Enforcers had the best attendance in the CEHL all three seasons by playing to near capacity crowds every game under the leadership of long-time minor league sports owner Barry Soskin. The Tri-City Hurricanes/Bay County Blizzard had the CEHL's second-best crowds during the first season, but no other CEHL club was ever to do well at the gate with the Junior A level game. The first CEHL Commissioner was Kevin Shanahan and he was replaced by Gord Young. The CEHL was founded by Shanahan of Fraser, Michigan; Bob Clouston of Troy, Michigan; Barry Soskin of Chicago, Illinois; Mike Killbreath of Grand Blanc, Michigan; Carl Voelker of Fraser, Michigan; Bill Cherfoli of Fraser, Michigan; and Jamie Graves of Fraser, Michigan. Voelker, Graves and Cherfoli were the owners of the Detroit Lightning, and also Great Lakes Sports Arena in Fraser. Clouston was a long- time owner and General Manager of hockey clubs, including the Port Huron North Americans of Major League Roller Hockey and many Junior A ice hockey teams. Killbreath was a long-time newspaper executive and was also one of the co- founders of the Great Lakes League in roller hockey. He launched the Tri-City Hurricanes but sold them at mid-season to concentrate on establishing a CEHL team in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. Killbreath left the CEHL instead to launch a new low-level pro league known as the International Independent Hockey League (IIHL), which began play in 2003 but ceased operations in 2004. After delaying the start of the 2004‚Äì2005 season by two weeks the CEHL officially suspended operations on October 3, 2004 for financial reasons. The league caused controversy due to preparing for the 2004-05 season by holding tryouts and charging players to participate without ever actually playing any games that season. The CEHL folded shortly after Soskin pulled the plug on his club. Soskin resurfaced as operator again in Toledo with the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) club. Some of the former teams joined other junior hockey leagues while many other franchises folded. League Champions * Toledo Jr. Storm (2001‚Äì02) * Detroit Belle Tire Lightning (2002‚Äì03) * Metro Fighting Moose (2003‚Äì2004). Former players Using many Canadians on rosters allowed the CEHL to create a strong league. A long list of CEHL players moved on to the minor pro ranks. One ex-CEHL player, Steve MacIntyre was signed by the New York Rangers after two seasons as the most feared fighter in the United Hockey League (UHL). He was recruited to play for the Tri-City Hurricanes in Bay City, Michigan by Owner & General Manager Mike Killbreath and Head Coach Kurt Walson. The Tri-City Hurricanes later became the Bay County Blizzard after a mid-season sale of the team by original owner Mike Killbreath. MacIntyre led the CEHL in penalty minutes and received a lifetime ban late in the season for his part in a nasty brawl with the Detroit Lightning. Banned by the CEHL, MacIntyre signed with the Muskegon Fury of the UHL and he helped them win the UHL's Colonial Cup as playoff champions. He was eventually signed by the New York Rangers and after spending several seasons in the minor leagues, MacIntyre made the National Hockey League (NHL) in 2008, with the Edmonton Oilers.

The primary characters are a tyrannosaurus named Archie who dresses like the Terminator, a triceratops named Lorenzo who wears a Hawaiian shirt, a one-eyed stegosaurus named Reese who wields heavy weapons, and a pterodactyl named Cyrano. In the comics, the Dinosaurs are actually intelligent aliens who resemble smaller versions of Earth dinosaurs presumably due to a convergent evolution (aside from their extraterrestrial nature, their backstory was only hinted at but never confirmed). After their spacecraft malfunctions in Earth's atmosphere and crashes into the ocean, they are stranded on Earth and become mercenaries for hire.

He was the Duke of Apulia from 1134 until his death. Roger's first public act took place at Melfi in 1129, where, though still a child, he accepted the fealty of some rebellious barons along with his father and his younger brother Tancred. His father was crowned king of Sicily the next year on 25 December. It is possible that Roger received the Duchy of Apulia at this time. He had certainly received it from his father by 1134. He was perhaps put under the tutelage or guardianship of Robert of Selby. He took part in his father's campaigns beginning in 1137, when he distinguished himself in the campaign against Ranulf of Alife, whom Pope Innocent II and the Emperor Lothair II had invested as rival duke of Apulia. His first major engagement was the Battle of Rignano on 30 October; a battle in which more experienced warriors, like his father, fled and some, like Duke Sergius VII of Naples, died. Roger's bravery, and success in the first charge, at Rignano solidified his martial reputation early. After Ranulf's death (1139), Apulia was secured, but Innocent and his ally, Prince Robert II of Capua, marched on Melfi. At Galluccio, Roger ambushed the papal troops with only a thousand knights and captured the pope and his entourage. Three days later, on July 25 at Mignano, Innocent confirmed the elder Roger as king, the younger as duke, and the third son, Alfonso, as prince of Capua--officially severing Robert from his support. Next, Duke Roger took the city of Naples into his possession and made it an integral part of the kingdom, ending the republican government which had continued after Sergius' death. In 1140, after the promulgation of the king's Assizes of Ariano, the first ducats were minted bearing an effigy of the young duke in battledress beside his father, with their hands on the Cross. The ducat was named after the duchy of Apulia. Roger and Alfonso, the second son Tancred being dead, then moved into the Abruzzi to harass papal lands. At that time, late in 1140, Roger's bride to be, Elizabeth, arrived from the court of her father, Theobald II of Champagne. Roger's most famous consort, however, was his mistress, Emma, the daughter of Achard II, Count of Lecce, with whom he had two illegitimate children, * Tancred, later king, and * William (after 1137 - 1167/68). In that same year (1140), Richard III of Gaeta died and his duchy was given to Roger. In 1149, barely thirty, Duke Roger died an unknown death in an unknown location. He was mourned by the Arab poet Abu ed-Daw, who said, \\"the arms of the brave have fallen . . . and the eloquent seek for words in vain.\\"While it is common attribute this lament to the death of Roger, it is in fact more likely one of his younger brothers. Roger was buried in the chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene next to the old Cathedral of Palermo. He was later transferred to an eponymous chapel now in the barracks of San Giacomo. His successor was his only surviving brother, William, later king.

It was released for DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Sega Genesis. This game was based on the series of Best...Ever! series of VHSes distributed by Random House's home video division preceding the TV series' The Busy World of Richard Scarry that was produced by CINAR and Paramount Television. It was remade in 1999 by Pearson Software for Microsoft Windows (95 and later) and Mac OS (System 7.5.1 and later), with the visuals and animation updated to resemble that of The Busy World of Richard Scarry, and the dialogue re-recorded with that show's voice actors reprising their roles. Gameplay The game consists of an interactive storybook that was written by Richard Scarry. Most of the game is spent discovering Busytown looking for things to interact with using either the game pad or a special mouse that could be purchased separately from the game and the console system. Young gamers will do everything from building a house using construction tools to delivering something to repair a ship. Games are relatively short and can be finished in about an hour. Familiar faces from Richard Scarry's works of literature include Huckle Cat and Lowly Worm. Another game allows players to control the wind in order to cause controlled havoc at the Busytown park and beach. Other games located throughout Busytown include helping finish Mr. Fix- it's latest invention, helping a patient at Dr. Diane's hospital, delivering goods throughout Busytown, helping Smokey the Firefighter prepare a fire engine for extinguishing a house fire, work at a gas station, fill orders at an automated deli, learn basic addition/subtraction on a see-saw, and help Bananas Gorilla get his box of bananas out of a park full of tourists. All games offer basic vocabulary practice as simple puzzles help improve basic problem solving and English language skills. The voice quality of this game is realistic when compared to the cartoons of that era. All of the characters act and talk like their counterparts in the books and the animated series. If the player puts too much lemonade or soda in the glass and spills some out of the glass, then one of the characters may ask the player \\"Are you blind?\\" in a gentle voice. Delivering stuff allows the town to slowly come to life. The Sega version omits the Mr. Fix-it, Dr. Diane, gas station, see saw and Bananas Gorilla portions of the game. Sequel and remake There was a sequel for this game titled Richard Scarry's How Things Work in Busytown which received a 1994 North American exclusive release from Novotrade and Simon & Schuster. Like the original game, it is intended for a pre-kindergarten through second grade audience and was released for DOS in addition to the Macintosh. Children that play this game learn to assemble machinery, bake bread, and complete other processes that are necessary to live life. This game makes kids think where food comes from, how bread is baked, and so on. Different outcomes can be observed through the several different learning methods. Young players can also learn vocabulary, word recognition, and sequencing.Tech Learning The original Busytown video game was remade in 1999 by Simon & Schuster Software, Pearson Software and Boston Animation. It was released for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems, and featured improved voice acting, graphics and animation resembling The Busy World of Richard Scarry animated series, with an instrumental cover of the show's theme song playing over the game's credits. The gameplay is still the same and the original songs from the 1993 release are included. However, the original game's Bananas Gorilla activity and song and Junior Seesaw activity was removed (the latter due to being redundant in comparison to the main Seesaw activity). Everything else from the DOS version was carried over to the remake. Reception Computer Gaming World in January 1994 liked the graphics \\"in spite of some choppiness in the animation. Richard Scarry's characters are faithfully reproduced\\". The magazine concluded that \\"Busytown is a must-have if there's a young child in the house\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \\"Busytown is playful learning at its best\\".

The river's headwaters are in the Coast Range at about and it flows roughly northwest until it empties into the Pacific Ocean near the small town of Orick, the only development in the -watershed. Course Redwood Creek begins near Board Camp Mountain in the Coast Ranges near Dinsmores. The stream's headwaters lie at about above sea level, in a network of small unnamed streams along the north sides of a ridge abutting the Mad River valley to the south. It flows north through a deep forested valley, receiving many small tributaries including Minor and Lacks creeks from the right. About downstream of the source, the creek crosses under State Route 299. Slightly less than from the mouth, the river passes the southern boundary of Redwood National Park. It then receives Bridge Creek from the left, before winding through several groves of Sequoia sempervirens, more commonly known as redwood trees, from which the stream takes its name. Several of the tallest redwoods in the world are near the creeks banks. Near the small town of Orick it curves west, and receives Prairie Creek, its largest tributary, from the right. It empties into the Pacific Ocean about north of Eureka and south of Crescent City. Watershed The long, narrow Redwood Creek drainage basin encompasses on the western slopes of the California Coast Ranges, entirely within Humboldt County. It stretches about from north to south and ranges from wide. Most of the stream flows in a broad, -deep valley sandwiched between the Mad River basin to the west, and the Klamath River drainage to the east. Elevations range from over on higher peaks of the mountains near the headwaters to sea level at the creek's mouth at the Pacific. The small town of Orick and the narrow strip of surrounding farmland are the only significant development in the entire basin. The river is free flowing and has no dams, only a few agricultural diversions in the last above the mouth. =Land use= The river provides recreation, and agricultural and industrial water supply for the community of Orick, California.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B July 1975 p.13 The lower portion of the creek and part of its estuary are in Redwood National and State Parks, but the upper portion is mostly privately owned. The park makes up 41 percent of the watershed and the Bureau of Land Management and United States Forest Service own 3 percent. Private lands downstream of the parks makes up only 1 percent. Private lands upstream make up 55 percent, 90 percent of which is owned by eight landowners, Green Diamond Company being the largest. Since the 19th Century significant portions of the watershed have been extensively logged, some of which was clear cut as recently as the 1970s when commercial logging and milling operations hurried to cut as much as possible on the eve of expansion of Redwood National Park. Ecology Redwood Creek in Redwood National Park The river provides wildlife habitat for preservation of rare and endangered species including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning. The greatest problem for the creek and its tributaries is erosion, which leads to excessive sediment buildup in the streambeds. The increased erosion is caused by extensive logging in the upper watershed, which began in the 1950s and continues today as the primary land use. In the last couple of decades alone, 65% of all land and 75% of the forested land in the basin has been harvested for timber. The building of logging roads has also increased erosion in the watershed. The sediment has filled in the pools and spawning habitat used by steelhead and coho salmon, which has caused a major decline in the fishery. Habitat in the lower portion of the creek has been degraded due to actions taken after the flooding of 1955 and 1964. The United States Army Corps of Engineers channelized the last of the creek through dredging and the building of levees. This has changed the creek's hydrology and sedimentation patterns, resulting in a decrease in flow. In addition, it has destroyed the riparian vegetation, which helps protect against erosion and decreases the water temperature to a level suitable for the creek's coldwater fish.

He was also a decorated politician and businessman, serving for ten years in the Victorian Legislative Council and as Lord Mayor of Melbourne and building a multimillion-dollar tyre business empire, Beaurepaires and Olympic Tyres. Early life Beaurepaire was born to Francis Edmund de Beaurepaire, a cable tram conductor, and Mary Edith Inman. Growing up in Melbourne, Beaurepaire was educated at Albert Park State School and Wesley College. He had his first swimming lesson at the age of four, when his father dropped him into the sea water baths at South Melbourne with a rope tied around his waist. He often practised in the sea, close to where effluent was ejected into Port Phillip Bay. Later, when he had earned more money, he paid tuppence (2d. = two pence) to enter the now demolished Stubbs' South Melbourne Baths to train. His career was nearly ended when he was hospitalized for 12 months with rheumatic fever. However, encouraged by his schoolteacher and South Melbourne barber Tommy Horlock, who later became his coach, Beaurepaire fought off the ailment and resumed training with the Albert Park State School Swimming Club. Swimming career In 1906, a few months before his 15th birthday, Beaurepaire won the and freestyle at the Victorian championships. In 1908, he captured the , 880 yd and mile freestyle events at the Australian Championships to claim a spot in the 1908 Summer Olympics team. On arrival in London with Horlock, he found that no arrangements had been made to pick them up, so they were forced to live with 16 pounds between them for a month, before officials became aware of their plight. Beaurepaire trained in London for three months before the Games. Unable to afford admission to swimming pools, He was forced to train at Highgate Ponds, at temperatures of 10 ¬∞C. After a event in the River Thames prior to the Olympics he was numbed by the cold to such an extent that he collapsed and needed to be pulled from the water to avoid drowning. Later he won the British Championship at Bradford, defeating Henry Taylor of Lancashire, and then proceeded to win the event at Nottingham. Arriving at the Olympics, the competitors were confronted with a pool dug into the athletics track, with no filtration or chlorination, effectively being a muddy pond. Beaurepaire had caught influenza and finished in second and third in the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle respectively, both events being won by Taylor. He was eliminated in the heats of the 100 m freestyle. He also finished fourth in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. After the Olympics, Beaurepaire again raced Taylor over and one mile (1.6 km) in Britain, winning the latter, in which some 20,000 spectators attended. Returning to Australia, he broke the world record at the Melbourne City Baths. He reappeared prominently in 1910 when he won more than a dozen state and national titles, breaking the world freestyle record in the process. His tour of the United Kingdom and continental Europe later that year resulted in world records in the 200 m, 300 m, , 400 m, 500 m and , three of which were achieved in one race. He later swept all of the British championships from up to one mile (1.6 km). He competed in 41 first- class and championship races in four months, winning all of them. In 1911, after his long return by sea to Australia, he suffered his first defeat in three years and was forced to abandon the freestyle event at the Australian Championships mid-race. Due to exhaustion, he took a break from competitive swimming to become a swimming instructor, earning 3 pounds 10 shillings (¬£3/10/-) a week with the Victorian Department of Education as a physical education instructor. He was barred from Olympic competition by the International Swimming Federation, which ruled him to be a professional, although he was not earning money for swimming. This ruled him out of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, where the Australian 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay team won gold. The decision to bar him was reversed in 1914. He joined the Australian Defence Force as an infantryman, but was invalided and joined the YMCA services, and served in Egypt, England and France before being hospitalized in 1917 with trench fever and gassing, and being returned to Australia. In February 1920, he won the Victorian championships, and soon after broke the 1000 m world record and qualified for the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. With swimming held in a near-freezing open-water canal, Beaurepaire abandoned the 400 m freestyle mid-race due to illness, but managed to claim a bronze in the 1500 m freestyle. He combined with William Herald, Ivan Stedman and Henry Hay to claim the silver medal in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay, some 21 s behind the American squad. His sister Lily also competed as part of the swimming and diving team, becoming the first brother- sister combination to represent Australia at the Summer Olympics. Back in Australia and later in Hawaii that year, he broke the and one mile (1.6 km) records, and twice broke the 1000 m and 1500 m records. He was named as the captain of the swimming team for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.

He was born in Winchester, Massachusetts, the son of Frederick O. Prince, former Mayor of the city of Boston and Helen Henry Prince. He studied at Harvard University, but left in his sophomore year to get an early start in the business world. He acquired a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, on 10 December 1885 and retained his individual membership throughout his life.  Business career  Prince made a fortune through his investments in a number of business ventures. Seeing the potential for the stockyard business, during the first decade of the 20th Century, he began buying up small companies, merging them into the giant Union Stockyards and Transit Company, of which he was chairman. To ensure control over delivery service to his stockyards, a significant and integral part of the food and tobacco sector, Prince's company acquired outright or held a controlling interest in the Pere Marquette Railway and the Chicago Junction Railway. Combined, these gave his stockyard operations hundreds of miles of rail lines and close to of land. In the early 1920s, Prince acquired Armour and Company, one of the country's major slaughterhouses and meatpacking operations. A friend of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., Prince helped finance Kennedy's 1925 acquisition of the Robertson-Cole/Film Book Offices, which would evolve into RKO Pictures. A Republican Party member and delegate to the 1928 convention, Prince aided President Franklin D. Roosevelt efforts to pull America out of the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1933, he formulated a widely debated program for consolidation for the nation's railroads. Known as the 'Prince Plan', it was projected to create savings for the nation's railroads of $740,000,000 annually. The Plan was rejected, because it would have thrown thousands of workers out of their jobs.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762088,00.html?iid=digg_share This experience led him to also propose sweeping changes in the United States Constitution to make the President more independent.  Personal life  Prince married Abigail Kinsley Norman (1860‚Äì1949) in 1884. They they had two sons, Frederick Henry Prince Jr. (1885-1962) and Norman Prince, who died in 1916 while flying with the Lafayette Escadrille in World War I. Besides his home in Biarritz, Mr. Prince had an estate \\"Villa Sainte-Helene\\" at Pau, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, France (today the residence of the Pr√©fet des Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques), where he had been Master of Foxhounds in the annual hunt for more than 25 years. He had homes in Boston (including Princemere, detailed below) and Aiken, South Carolina, and in 1932, bought the Marble House at Newport, Rhode Island from Mrs. Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont (formerly Alva Vanderbilt). In 1947, Frederick H. Prince and his wife established the Prince Charitable Trusts, that is a benefactor to various philanthropic endeavours in the city of Chicago, Washington, D.C. and the state of Rhode Island.  Sportsman  Prince was a member of the New York Yacht Club, he owned the Weetamoe, a J-class yacht. The Weetamoe competed for a berth in the America's Cup, losing in the 1934 trials to the ultimate Cup winner Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and his yacht, Rainbow. In the 1890s, Prince purchased a estate at Wenham, Massachusetts, that he called Princemere. He owned a large number of horses and established numerous riding trails and carriage roads on the estate. Prince was one of the nine founding members of the National Steeplechase Association, created in 1895 to organize competitive steeplechase racing. Following his death, Gordon College relocated to the estate in 1955. The most distinct building on campus is the stone mansion, built in 1911, which had been Prince's residence. Today, it is known as Frost Hall and houses many of the College's faculty and administrative offices, as well as the Admissions Department.

In all three motion pictures, he is portrayed by actor Richard Bright. He functions as Michael Corleone's personal enforcer, bodyguard and assassin. In the novel In the novel The Godfather, Neri begins his career as a New York City police officer, where he earns a reputation for a fierce temper, quick reflexes, and physical strength. He frequently patrols with a large flashlight, which he uses to assault Italian youths who run with gangs or shattering the windshields of diplomats who disregard traffic or parking laws. After his wife leaves him, Neri kills a drug dealer and pimp by cracking his skull with the flashlight and is convicted of manslaughter. Tom Hagen and Peter Clemenza see Neri as a potential replacement for Luca Brasi, Vito Corleone's feared enforcer, and arrange his release from prison. Normally, policemen are barred from becoming made men, but they were impressed enough with Neri to recommend that Michael grant an exception to the rule. Michael, appealing to Neri's sense of loyalty and Sicilian-American roots, recruits him into Clemenza's regime. Clemenza is initially impressed by the ferocity that Neri displays in their first meeting. Neri later \\"makes his bones\\" and becomes Michael's chief lieutenant by personally murdering Moe Greene and Emilio Barzini on Michael's behalf. Neri carries out the latter murder while disguised in his old police uniform. After Salvatore Tessio is executed for betraying Michael, Neri is promoted to caporegime of Tessio's former crew, and plays a key role in the wave of murders that re-establishes the Corleones as the most powerful crime family in the nation. When Michael and his family move to Nevada, Neri becomes head of security for all hotels controlled by the Corleones. In the film series In the film version of The Godfather, Neri's backstory is not mentioned. He does not say a word in the first film and following Michael's return from exile in Sicily, Neri becomes his body-guard, accompanying him everywhere. In the famous \\"baptism sequence\\", Neri, disguised in a police uniform, guns down Barzini and his body-guards on the steps of a courthouse, much as he does in the novel. However, the murder of Greene, which occurs simultaneously, is handled by another, anonymous gunman. In The Godfather Part II, Neri is portrayed as Michael's unofficial second-in-command in his operations in Nevada, and is one of Michael's capos along with Rocco Lampone and Frank Pentangeli. In a deleted scene, Neri is shown \\"convincing\\" Meyer Klingman, a hotel owner, to give his interest in the hotel to the Corleone Family. When Klingman protests, Neri slaps him in the face and pursues him through the casino's showroom, while casino security guards (now under Corleone control) do nothing. During a Senate investigation of Michael's criminal syndicate, Neri is identified as a capo for the Corleone family on an organization chart. Neri also carries out the execution of Michael's brother Fredo, under Michael's orders: while out fishing together on Lake Tahoe, Neri shoots Fredo in the back of the head. By the time of The Godfather Part III, with Michael's decision to \\"go legitimate\\" by selling off his casino interests and handing over control of his rackets to former subordinate Joey Zasa, Neri continues to serve as his body-guard, as well as becoming the new underboss (replacing Fredo Corleone). When Zasa betrays Michael and attempts to have him murdered at a meeting of the Commission in Atlantic City, Neri saves Michael's life and later helps Michael's nephew, Vincent Mancini, to plan Zasa's murder. When Michael retires and transfers control of the family to Vincent, Neri is the second to pledge his loyalty, after Cal√≤, the former body-guard of Don Tommasino. In the closing scenes of the film, Vincent calls upon Neri's skills one last time, sending him to infiltrate Vatican City, where he guns down corrupt Archbishop Gilday and tosses his body down a staircase. In other media In Mark Winegardner's novel The Godfather's Revenge, Neri and his nephew take part in an attempt to obtain information from antagonist Nick Geraci's father. He is seriously wounded in a shootout at the end of the novel. In The Godfather: The Game, Neri is voiced by Garry Chalk.

The designers claim that it will deliver many benefits to current and future CANDU reactors-using natural uranium or other advanced nuclear fuel cycles. These include greater operating and safety margins, extended plant life, better economics and increased power. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is about 10 cm (four inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20 inches) long and weighs about 20 kg (44 lbs) and replaces 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. This reduces the power rating of the hottest pins in the bundles, for the same total bundle power output. Also, the design incorporates special geometry modifications that enhance the heat transfer between the fuel and surrounding coolant. Twenty-four of these fuel bundles have been tested in the Point Lepreau CANDU 6 reactor in New Brunswick, Canada, and results indicate CANFLEX meets all expectations and regulatory requirements.

The book is divided into sections by river, each described with its source, course, and major tributaries, including cultural and historical notes. The work is much expanded from its source text, the older (and now lost) Water Classic (Shuijing Ê∞¥Á∂ì). The original text described 137 different rivers in China and was traditionally credited to Eastern Han scholar and geographer Sang Qin (Ê°ëÈí¶) during the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280 AD). Qing dynasty scholars gave it a later date (during the Three Kingdoms Period) because of the names of the counties and commanderies. Its authorship was then attributed to Jin dynasty scholar Guo Pu. Li Daoyuan's 40-volume, 300,000-character version includes 1252 rivers.

An alternative characterization of conjugacy-closed normal subgroups is that all class automorphisms of the whole group restrict to class automorphisms of the subgroup. The following facts are true regarding conjugacy-closed subgroups: * Every central factor (a subgroup that may occur as a factor in some central product) is a conjugacy- closed subgroup. * Every conjugacy-closed normal subgroup is a transitively normal subgroup. * The property of being conjugacy-closed is transitive, that is, every conjugacy-closed subgroup of a conjugacy-closed subgroup is conjugacy-closed. The property of being conjugacy-closed is sometimes also termed as being conjugacy stable. It is a known result that for finite field extensions, the general linear group of the base field is a conjugacy-closed subgroup of the general linear group over the extension field. This result is typically referred to as a stability theorem. A subgroup is said to be strongly conjugacy-closed if all intermediate subgroups are also conjugacy- closed.

Maharashtra Day is commonly associated with parades and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Maharashtra. It is celebrated to commemorate the creation of a Marathi speaking state of Maharashtra. Background The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 defined boundaries for the states within India on the basis of languages. The Bombay State that was formed as a consequence of this act, however, was composed of different areas where different languages were spoken; Marathi, Gujarati, Kutchi and Konkani. The Sanyukta Maharashtra Samiti was at the forefront of the movement to divide the Bombay State into two states; one composed of areas where people primarily spoke Gujarati and Kutchhi and the other where people primarily spoke Marathi and Konkani. The state of Maharashtra and Gujarat were formed as a result of this movement according to the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960 enacted by the Parliament of India on 25 April 1960. The act came into effect on 1 May 1960, hence the reason of annual celebration. Observance Every year the Government of Maharashtra issues a notification declaring the 1st of May to be a public holiday to be celebrated as Maharashtra Day. This holiday applies to all the schools, offices and companies under the jurisdiction of the State and central Government celebrate this day by organising various programmes.

Early life Davis was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, moving to Memphis with his parents at age 14. There he completed the high school curriculum of the public schools, and in 1917 he completed law school at the University of Mississippi. In 1918 he was admitted to the Tennessee bar. Public service In 1923, Davis became a city judge in Memphis, serving in this post until 1927. From 1928 until 1940, Davis served as vice mayor and Commissioner of Public Safety. He became a close associate of Memphis political \\"boss\\" E. H. Crump. Davis was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and with the direction of Crump he administered a police force that was 70% KKK. The result was relatively unquestioned violence against black residents of Memphis. Congress In 1940, the seat for the 10th Congressional District, which included Memphis, came open after three-term incumbent Clift Chandler was elected mayor of Memphis. Crump arranged for his colleague Davis to receive the Democratic nomination for the post. In those days, the Democratic nomination was tantamount to election in most of Tennessee (except for heavily Republican East Tennessee). Davis won the special election and took office on February 15, 1940. Davis was elected to a full term in November of that year and was reelected eleven times. His district was renumbered as the 9th District after Tennessee lost a district in the 1950 Census. Crump died in 1954, but many of his supporters remained in office for years afterwards. In fact, Davis was re-elected five times after Crump's death. During this time, Davis served as chairman of the House Special Committee on Campaign Expenditures, a group which was charged with attempting to find a legal way to control the influence of money on politics and looked into the beginning of what became, many years later, became the system of campaign finance reform that started to be implemented after the Watergate scandal. Davis was one of five Representatives shot on March 1, 1954, in the U.S. Capitol shooting incident when four Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from the visitors' balcony into the chamber of the United States House of Representatives. Davis was shot in the leg, but was not seriously wounded. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. Defeat The Memphis area became much friendlier to Republicans in the 1960s, in part due to a massive crossover of white voters from the Democrats. As evidence of this growing influence, Davis barely held onto his seat in 1962, defeating his Republican challenger, former city councilman Ed Davis, by only 1,200 votes. This was particularly shocking considering that he had been unopposed for reelection two years earlier. In 1964, Davis lost the August Democratic primary to Shelby County legislator George W. Grider, a retired naval officer and fellow attorney. Unlike Davis, Grider had no past ties to the Crump machine. Davis did not return to Memphis full-time, but maintained a residence in Washington, D.C. where he resumed the practice of law until his death. He is buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis. Legacy The Clifford Davis Federal Building in Memphis was named after him. As of May 2, 2007, the \\"Clifford Davis Federal Building\\" is designated the \\"Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building.\\" See also *United States Congress members killed or wounded in office References Sources 1897 births 1970 deaths Members of the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee Tennessee Democrats American shooting survivors Politicians from Memphis, Tennessee University of Mississippi School of Law alumni Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives People from Hazlehurst, Mississippi 20th-century American politicians Tennessee lawyers ","title":"Clifford Davis (politician)"},{"id":"4978199","text":"Lomax is a neighborhood of La Porte, a city in Harris County, Texas, United States.

Many of Thorgerson's designs are notable for their surreal elements. He often places objects out of their traditional contexts, especially with vast spaces around them, to give them an awkward appearance while highlighting their beauty. To quote Thorgerson, \\"I like photography because it is a reality medium, unlike drawing which is unreal. I like to mess with reality ... to bend reality.

A post on the official Pink Floyd website called him a \\"graphic genius\\". Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason said that he was a \\"tireless worker right up to the end\\".

Countess von Buhler,Teaching Books (retrieved December 17, 2010).Teaching Books. is an American artist, author, playwright, performer, and producer. Immersive Theater Speakeasy Dollhouse by von Buhler is a true tale of New York City Prohibition-era bootlegging, mafia, infidelity, and murder. Von Buhler had been haunted by a shocking family mystery for years. Her grandparents, Frank and Mary Spano, owned two speakeasies in the Bronx during Prohibition: one that masqueraded as a bakery, the other a secret nightclub. Shortly after Prohibition ended, her grandfather was shot and killed on the street in Manhattan. Her grandmother was pregnant with her mother at the time, and upon hearing the news of the murder she went into labor. Von Buhler's grandfather's body was laid out in one room of their small Bronx apartment while her mother was born in the room next to it. \\"Nobody still living in my family knows why my grandfather was shot. Nothing was known about the killer, his motive, or a trial. My grandmother took these secrets to her grave. And so, over the past two years, I have been dusting off a complicated, historically significant story,\\" explains von Buhler. To more thoroughly explore her grandfather's murder and events leading up to it, von Buhler created an elaborate speakeasy dollhouse set complete with handmade dolls in her art studio. The set includes a plush secret nightclub, a bakery, a pre-war apartment, a bootlegging bathroom, a morgue, and even Ellis Island. The set contains crime scene details that can be examined from every angle. Von Buhler was featured in the \\"Gurney For Grandpa\\" episode of Oddities (TV series) discussing this project. Taking it one step further, the artist created an immersive theatrical experience to go along with the sets and her own investigation. Speakeasy Dollhouse stages these events in a historic Lower East Side speakeasy elaborately set up to mirror the dollhouse sets. The actors aren't visually distinguished from the audience, making the audience as key to the show as the performers. The play's tagline is \\"The speakeasy is my dollhouse and you are my dolls.\\" A limited edition graphic novel book, \\"The Bloody Beginning\\", and initial performances in 2011 were paid through Kickstarter, a crowdfunding site. The play will continue into 2015 with tickets available to the general public. Of Dolls and Murder, directed by Susan Marks and narrated by John Waters (Hairspray, Cry Baby), is a documentary about Francis Glessner Lee's crime scene investigation dollhouse dioramas. Marks created an Of Dolls and Murder sequel based on Speakeasy Dollhouse. Speakeasy Dollhouse became the brand name for all of Cynthia von Buhler's immersive theater productions. The original show was renamed The Bloody Beginning. =Immersive Theater Productions= *October 2017 - February 2018, \\"The Illuminati Ball\\", Weylin formerly Williamsburgh Savings Bank, Brooklyn, NY *March 2016 - August 2018, \\"The Illuminati Ball, An Immersive Excursion\\", A Secret Estate, NY, NY *June 2016 - August 2016, \\"The Bloody Beginning\\", Weylin, Brooklyn, NY *March 2015 - November 2015, \\"Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic\\", Liberty Theater, NY, NY *March 2014 - April 2014, \\"The Brothers Booth\\", The Players (New York City), NY *March 2011 - April 2015, \\"The Bloody Beginning\\", The Back Room, NY, NY Graphic Novels The Girl Who Handcuffed Houdini follows private investigator Minky Woodcock as she uncovers secrets surrounding the final days of the world-famous escape artist, Harry Houdini.

Von Buhler investigated the death of Houdini and based her story on true crime evidence. Evelyn Evelyn are a musical duo formed by Amanda Palmer (of The Dresden Dolls) and Jason Webley. According to the fictional backstory described by Palmer and Webley, the duo consists of conjoined twin sisters (aka \\"Eva\\" and \\"Lyn\\"), Evelyn and Evelyn Neville, who were discovered in 2007 by Palmer and Webley.

Weekend At this point von Buhler began utilizing unconventional media in her art: video projection, living fauna, found objects, human detritus, and electronic audio. By combining these media, often enhanced with text and electronics, von Buhler's canvasses frequently became kinetic installations. \\"Regardless of medium, all of von Buhler's pieces require the viewer to get involved: sometimes physically, by feeding a caged animal or inserting a coin to operate a machine. For example, \\"Sir Repetitious,\\" a man's transparent insides reveal two live rats, hungry for the food and attention of onlookers ‚Äì feed the rodents with the supplied seed, and you are satisfying \\"Sir Repetitious\\" on physical and metaphorical levels. Miss Ann Thrope is a life-sized painting of a woman with two doves perched inside. When the birds move in the piece, they change its equilibrium and alter its intended meaning. A velvet-curtained puppet theater sets the stage for Show and Tell, a multimedia painting that explores the use of word versus action with hidden visual and auditory messages. \\"Please Don't Look Up My Skirt\\" is a commentary on date-rape in which a Botticelli-esque girl without arms or legs tries modestly to cover herself, imploring the viewer not to violate her; those who disregard the plea see what they have become when they look up her skirt. Cynth-O-Matic offers various plastic capsules containing actual samples of the artist's body hair and fluids from a vending machine. The piece is von Buhler's critique of those who attend art openings to chat with the artist and scarf hors d'oeuvres without buying any art. For only 25 cents they can buy a piece of the artist.

The district serves the cities of La Porte, Morgan's Point, and Shoreacres, a small portion of Pasadena, a small portion of Deer Park. The district includes Lomax, which was once an incorporated city but is now a part of the city of La Porte. In 2011, La Porte ISD's Lomax Elementary won the national Blue Ribbon school award. In 2017, Jennie Reid Elementary also won the prestigious award. School board The current superintendent of La Porte ISD is Lloyd Graham. * Dee Ann -President * David Janda-Vice President * Dennis Slate-Trustee * Lee Wallace-Trustee History La Porte Independent School District was formed in 1916 and a new three-story red-brick building was constructed near Broadway and \\"C\\" streets which would house the bused-in additional students from Lomax and Morgan's Point. In 1917, the student body selected orange and white as the school colors, the bulldog as the school mascot and published a one-time-only yearbook Etropal, which is La Porte spelled backwards. During the years of the depression, 1918-1924 that followed in the wake of World War I many citizens were unable to pay their taxes, and as a result, the school term lasted only six months. In 1921, Mr. C. E. Wade was appointed principal, and he organized the first football team, orchestra, choral club and \\"mothers' club\\" during his first year. In 1935, the second yearbook, The LPHS Daze, had a one-time publication by Lynnwood Anderson, editor-in-chief; there was not another yearbook published until 1946 and it was named The Reflector as it stands to date. In 1940, La Porte Elementary was built to accommodate students in grades one through six. The existing building continued to house grades seven through twelve. In 1943, disaster struck the system in the form of \\"The 1943 Hurricane.\\" The top two floors were severely damaged and were removed. The remaining first floor was repaired and 12 classrooms, cafeteria, music rooms, manual training room, athletic dressing rooms and showers, storage units and a tax office were added to make this the junior high and high school. In 1945, a new gymnasium/auditorium was constructed on Broadway between the elementary school and the newly remodeled school. A new high school was also built that year which is now the old part of La Porte Junior High. In 1948, the elementary school had a new wing added and a new Intermediate school was built. For the first time the La Porte educational system had a complete school unit housing and segregating primary, intermediate, and secondary levels. History records that La Porte was not unique in the country in that its schools were segregated until the 1960s, but its transition to an integrated system was quite remarkable. Paralleling the history of the all-white schools, La Porte black students were housed in temporary facilities until a school of their own was built and until they joined the all-white students in the district's schools. In 1909, a Baptist church was used during the week for black students and later a Methodist church was purchased for their use by the La Porte Independent School District. Miss Viola DeWalt was the first teacher of this school. In 1953, DeWalt Elementary was opened as a neighborhood school for black children and grades one through eight were taught in this building. Grades nine through twelve were sent by bus to Carver High School in Baytown, Texas. The La Porte school system was one of the first districts in the country to fully integrate its student body and facilities in 1963-1964. This set an important precedent of peaceful desegregation for the state as well as the country. The school district purchased in 1959 on \\"J\\" Street (now Fairmont Parkway) and built a new La Porte High School, housing grades nine through twelve. The old high school then became the La Porte Junior High as it stands today. In 1963, the first fully air-conditioned school in the district, James H. Baker Elementary, was opened for students in the Fairmont Park area. This school later became Baker Junior High, but is now the sixth grade campus for the entire district. In 1964, the high school added a planetarium, and \\"E\\" building wing, and in 1972 a new library wing was added. Since 1966, the district has changed boundaries, annexed several communities, and built and remodeled campuses all over the city. For students in the south Bayshore and Shoreacres areas, Bayshore Elementary was opened in 1966; students in the College park area were sent to College Park Elementary(1969); students in Lomax (annexed by La Porte as West La Porte) were sent to the newly built Lomax Elementary in 1976. Jennie Reid Elementary 1977 and Leo Rizzuto Elementary Schools were built to accommodate the students in the Fairmont Park area(1981). Lomax Junior High was built in 1986 to accommodate the growth that La Porte Junior High could not support. Over the years the La Porte High School has expanded to include: The Sonja Angelo Theater, a basketball gymnasium, swimming pool complex, vocational building, student center and the Henry Einfeldt Band Hall. In 1996, a new field house and a science building were added. The La Porte Independent School District has come a long way from a one-room classroom to twelve separate campuses and a city population of over 31,880 and growing.

Thus, the lineage of Zambara's vocal training can be traced to the Italian vocal maestri of the early 19th-century. Teaching Following Whitney's death in 1950, Zambara, while continuing to perform, resolved to continue his teacher's legacy by training singers in bel canto, and by passing on to others the style and performance traditions of classical singing as taught to him by Professor Whitney. Zambara's teaching career began at the University of Tennessee in 1952. Between 1958 and 1960, he taught at the University of Oregon. In 1961, he returned to the University of Tennessee as the chair of the voice department, teaching there until 1981. During that tenure, Zambara also founded the Knoxville Opera, and in 1980, he received the Tennessee Governor's Award in the Arts. Subsequently, Zambara was appointed to endowed voice professorships at the St. Louis Conservatory of Music, the New England Conservatory of Music, Curtis Institute, and the Juilliard School. In 1997, he was inducted into the American Academy of Teachers of Singing, a select group of nationally recognized teachers. At the time of his death, Zambara was on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music. He had also served on the faculty of the Metropolitan Opera Young Artists Program, the Music Academy of the West, the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, and the Franz Schubert Instit√ºt. Zambara often was asked to serve as a judge at district and regional Metropolitan Opera auditions. For many years, Zambara had been one of the most sought-after voice professors in the United States. Many of his pupils are successful performers in the opera houses of Europe and the United States. As well, many are successful teachers who follow his example by training young singers in the bel canto vocal tradition.

The assistant typically helps professors with instructional responsibilities as teaching assistants or with academic research responsibilities as research assistants, aids coaches with an athletic team, or is employed by other university departments (such as housing or academic advising). Rather than receive hourly wages, GAs are often remunerated in the form of a stipend. Assistantships provide experience for graduate students, increasing their future employment options . Graduate assistantships are beneficial to the employing university as well because graduate assistants fill positions that would cost the university significantly more to fill with traditional employees.

It is one of eight constituent associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). IAVCEI is run by an Executive Committee whose membership changes every four years. The Executive determines policies for the Association, enacting them through a series of commissions and task groups. Bulletin of Volcanology is the journal of IAVCEI.IAVCEI About Us. Retrieved 01 Apr 2015. History The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, a non-governmental organisation, was established in 1919. The Volcanology section of the IUGG, also founded in 1919, was the forerunner of the IAVCEI. It was formally constituted at the First General Assembly of the IUGG (Rome, 1922). The name was changed to International Association of Volcanology (IAV) at the Fourth General Assembly of the IUGG (Stockholm, 1930). IAV statutes and by-laws were adopted in Helsinki in 1960 and were revised in Zurich in 1967 and in Canberra in 1979. The association's present name was adopted in 1967 in order to harmonise with the name of the International Association of Seismology and the Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI). IAVCEI statutes and objectives The statutes of IAVCEI include four objectives: *To study scientific problems related to volcanoes and volcanic processes, past and present, and to the chemistry of the Earth's interior. *To encourage, initiate and coordinate research, and promote international cooperation in these studies. *To encourage volcanologists to alert appropriate authorities about the importance of adequate surveillance of active and potentially active volcanoes, and of volcanic risk assessment. *To arrange for the discussion and publication of the results of scientific research on volcanology and on the chemistry of the Earth's interior. Countries are members of IUGG. After 1996 individuals have been able to become members of IAVCEI. Publications The Bulletin of Volcanology is the journal of IAVCEI. It is a continuation of the Bulletin Volcanologique, which began publication in 1922. The association has published 22 volumes of the Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World. The Catalogue was announced in 1924, and was begun in 1948 when the regional arrangement and format were established. The first volume, on Indonesia, was published in 1951, and the 22nd volume, on New Zealand, in 1967.

The asymmetrical spinnaker was voted down by the class in 2006, but revisited after the 2007 season with a modified proposal suggesting a slightly modified rig and more restricted spinnaker shape. The proposal passed, taking effect in 2008. A retractable bowsprit is used with the masthead asymmetrical spinnaker. The running back stays of the older design were removed and the mast is supported with a new design of shrouds. The boat has a high performance planing hull. Leeboards and dual rudder foils are used.

It has been found that germinated grains in general have nutritional advantages. The rice is used in Japanese and Korean cuisine. Cooked germinated brown rice is softer and less chewy than plain brown rice‚Äîit is more acceptable to children in particular‚Äîand has additional nutritional advantages. Germinated brown rice is produced by soaking for 4‚Äì20 hours in warm water (or longer at lower temperature), changing water a few times if some smell develops, and rinsing before cooking. This stimulates germination, which activates various enzymes in the rice. By this method, it is possible to obtain a more complete amino acid profile, including GABA.Germinated brown rice and rice bread, presented at FAO International Year of Rice conference in 2004 Although GBR is readily prepared at home, in Japan from 1995 it is sold ready-germinated at a higher price than ordinary rice.

A re'em, also re√´m (), is an animal mentioned nine times in the Hebrew BibleJob , Deuteronomy , Numbers and ; Psalms , and ; and Isaiah . and variously translated as a unicorn or a wild ox. It was first identified in modern times with the aurochs by Johann Ulrich Duerst, who discovered it was based on the Akkadian cognate rimu (íÑ† in cuneiform), meaning Bos primigenius, the aurochs, progenitor of cattle.Die Rinder von Babylonien, Assyrien und √Ñgypten (Berlin, 1899:7-8) This has been generally accepted,For instance Jonas Salo, \\"Cattle Raising in Palestine\\" Agricultural History 26.3 (July 1952), pp. 93-104. as it is today even among religious scholars. It has been translated in some Christian Bible translations as \\"oryx\\" (which was accepted as the referent in Modern Hebrew) and as \\"unicorn\\" in the King James Version, possibly referring to a one-horned rhinoceros such as Rhinoceros unicornis. The King James Version of the Book of Job followed the Greek Old Testament and Jerome Vulgate in the translation of re'em into unicorn: Some Bible translations into English, including the American Standard Version and New American Standard Bible, interpret re'em as \\"wild ox\\". Re'em is also speculated to refer to the Arabian Oryx. In Jewish folklore, the re'em was larger than a mountain and could dam the river Jordan with its dung. To survive during the deluge, Noah had to strap its horns to the side of the Ark so that its nostril could protrude into the Ark, allowing the animal to breathe. King David, while still a shepherd, mistook its horn for a mountain and climbed it, and then the re'em got up, carrying David up to the heavens. He prayed to God to save him, so a lion passed in front of the re'em. As the re'em bowed down to the king of beasts, David climbed off but was threatened by the lion. He prayed again, and an animal passed by so the lion could chase it and leave David unharmed. The Re'em is also mentioned in metaphorical terms in Tractate Zebahim 113b, saying in short that it took a tremendous miracle for one to actually survive the deluge. The association may be linked to the mythical beast Behemoth, described in other areas of Jewish mythology, aggada, and Kabbala due to the striking parallels between the two beasts.

Smith was born to Thomas Edward Smith (1783‚Äì1841) and Mary Kennedy Whitehill (1788‚Äì1849), natives of Virginia, on their Warren County, Ohio, farm near Waynesville. A voracious reader, his early schooling was limited because of his duties on the family farm, but his father believed in the advantages of an education, so that John Quincy was able to spend a short time at Miami University. In July 1852, Smith married Lydia Emeline Evans, a native of Warren county. They had six children, one of whom died in childhood. In 1854, he relocated his young family to Clinton County, Ohio. He was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1859 as a Republican. In Columbus, during the legislative sessions, Smith's roommate was James A. Garfield, who was just starting out on his public career, and other intimate acquaintances were John Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant. In 1861, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives and served two years. In 1870, he was elected as a member of the Ohio State Board of Equalization. He was again elected State Senator in 1871. In 1872, Smith was elected to Congress from Ohio's Third Congressional District. In 1874, he was renominated for Congress, but defeated by John S. Savage. Smith was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the Grant Administration on December 11, 1875.Poore 1878 : 235 His administration saw several controversies, including the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 (including the Battle of the Little Bighorn), the removal of the Ponca Indians to Indian Territory and charges of corruption against his chief clerk, Samuel Galpin. He was removed from office on September 27, 1877.Edward E. Hill, \\"John Q. Smith, 1875-77\\", in Robert M. Kvasnicka and Herman J. Viola (eds.), The Commissioners of Indian Affairs from 1824 to 1977, pp. 149-153. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Smith as United States consul general to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, serving from 1878 until he resigned in 1882. He remained an ardent Republican until President Grover Cleveland's first administration, when he allied himself with the Democratic party because of his views on tariff reform, and thereafter he remained a Democrat. His published articles on tariff in the New York Evening Post attracted wide attention throughout the country and were extensively quoted by the press and on the stump. Smith left public life and retired to his farm, \\"Sycamores\\", in Oakland where he died. He is buried in Miami Cemetery, Waynesville, Ohio.  Notes   Sources  * Taylor, William A.

An entity bean can manage its own persistence (Bean managed persistence) or can delegate this function to its EJB Container (Container managed persistence). An entity bean is identified by a primary key. If the container in which an entity bean is hosted crashes, the entity bean, its primary key, and any remote references survive the crash. In EJB 3.0, entity beans were superseded by the Java Persistence API (which was subsequently completely separated to its own spec as of EJB 3.1). Entity Beans have been marked as a candidate for pruning as of Java EE 6http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/javaee6overview- part3-139660.htmlhttp://www.infoq.com/news/2009/04/ee-pruning and are therefore considered a deprecated technology. Entity Beans before EJB 2.0 should not be used in great numbers because each entity bean was in fact a RMI stub with its own RMI connection to the EJB server. Obtaining 1000 entity beans as a single operation would result in 1000 simultaneous internet connections to the RMI back-end . Since TCP/IP only supports 65536 ports you are essentially limited to using 65536 entity beans at a time. For example, if a client application wanted to monitor the state of 1024 database entries it would take 1024 entity bean references and thus 1024 RMI connections to the EJB server, the EJB server would in turn need to support all 1024 connections from each client application, and would be limited to serving at most 64 client applications at which point all further internet connections would be ignored. These limitations are impossible to overcome when using entity beans over RMI.  References  External links *What is an Entity Bean?

Design and development The Airtourer was the winning design, submitted by Henry Millicer, the chief aerodynamicist of Australia's Government Aircraft Factories, in a competition organised by Britain's Royal Aero Club in 1953.103 entries were submitted in the 1953 competition. (Mondey) A wooden prototype was constructed by a small group of enthusiasts (the Air Tourer Group of the Australian Ultra Light Aircraft Association) in the Melbourne suburb of Williamstown during the late 1950s. This prototype, registered VH-FMMVH-FMM (nicknamed Foxtrot Mickey Mouse) was first flown on 31 March 1959 by Flt. Lt.Randell Green at Moorabbin airport. The Airtourer design is of cantilever low-wing monoplane configuration, with a fixed tricycle landing gear. It has interconnected ailerons and flaps, with both systems functioning as both ailerons and as flaps when operated. The nosewheel was steerable. Space was available for luggage (45 kg weight limit). The prototypePhotograph of prototype from Airtourer Association website was demonstrated to aero clubs and flying schools as a possible replacement for existing training aircraft, mostly Tiger Moths and Chipmunks. After trial flights over Melbourne and then to the Latrobe Valley Airport development continued to the all-metal version. The all-metal prototype to production standard (VH-MVA) followed on 12 December 1961. Interest was shown in the design by Mervyn Richardson, Chairman of Victa Ltd, which at that time was best known for making lawn mowers and light two-stroke engines. Richardson was interested in entering an aviation-related industry. During the period 1961 to 1966, Victa Ltd. undertook production of the all-metal Airtourer, building both 100 hp and 115 hp models. Victa production continued until 1966. As the Australian Government had rejected Victa's appeals for tariff protection assistance, or for direct subsidies to keep the production lines open, the company chose to suspend production of the Airtourer in February 1966, by which time it had built 172 Airtourers. While the Aviation division initially remained open to spares support for existing aircraft and to continue development of the four-seat Aircruiser, the division was completely shut down on 20 January 1967.Taylor 1966, p. 9.Taylor 1967, p. 8. The manufacturing rights to the Airtourer were purchased the following year by the maintenance firm Aero Engine Services Ltd (AESL) in New Zealand where further production of 115 hp and 150 hp models took place until 1973. Henry Millicer had designed the Victa Aircruiser, a four-seater derivative design, powered by a 210 hp Continental O-360 engine, which was certificated in 1967. AESL acquired the rights to the design in 1970 and it was used to form the basis of the CT/4 Airtrainer. A total of 168 were completed or significantly completed by Victa in Sydney and a further 80 built by AESL in Hamilton NZ. Actually it would be correct to say that 170 serial numbers were issued by Victa and 80 by AESL. Examination of the records show that some of the late serial numbers issued by Victa were completed in NZ and issued with a NZ serial number (starting at 501). In addition, some of the Victa-built aircraft were rebuilt in the factory by AESL and issued with NZ serial numbers which accounts for some duplication. AESL delivery pilot Cliff Tait used an Airtourer, ZK-CXU Miss Jacy, for a record breaking flight, circumnavigating the globe between May and August 1969 and covering 53,097 km in 288 flying hours. Miss Jacy is now on display at the MOTAT museum in Auckland The Australian Certificates of Type Approval for the Victa Air Tourer 100 and 115 are now held by the Airtourer Cooperative Ltd of New South Wales, Australia.Certificate of Type Approval No. 34-1Certificate of Type Approval No. 34-3 Some 90 aircraft remain in Australia with around 20 or so elsewhere, mainly in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. =Design notes= VH-MVA was later re-engined and was the first Airtourer 115 around 1963. As for FMM, it is owned by the Museum of Victoria having last been displayed at the Australian Naval Aviation Museum in Nowra, NSW. The Air Tourer was produced with a 'square hand grip' on the centrally-located control stick. Variants AESL produced 7 Airtourers from parts provided by Victa, before launching production of its own aircraft, ultimately produced in 7 different variants: *T1 powered by a 100 hp Continental O-200 engine *T2 powered by a 115 hp Lycoming O-235 engine *T3 powered by a 130 hp Rolls-Royce O-240 engine *T4 powered by a 150 hp Lycoming O-320-E1A ‚Äì fixed-pitch propeller *T5 powered by a 150 hp Lycoming O-320-E1A ‚Äì constant speed propeller *T6 initially a small run of 4 aircraft for the RNZAF, powered by a 150 hp Lycoming O-320-E1A ‚Äì constant speed propeller with gross weight increased from T-5, and with a 24 volt electrical system. *T8 powered by a 160 hp Lycoming AEIO-320 with fuel injection.

These lanes are usually marked with white diamonds or lozenge, hence their name. Diamond lanes are generally the right-most or left- most lane on the road. They are usually implemented to provide ways through traffic congestion, for safety reasons, and to encourage environmentally friendly transportation. A diamond lane may be intended for a specific type of traffic, or for several types. The intended use of a diamond lane is marked by traffic signs. In most areas, violating the rules of a diamond lane is punishable by a fine. Some common examples are: * High-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV), also known as a carpool lane. These are typically freeway lanes intended for multiple occupant or \\"green vehicles\\" (such as hybrid or electric cars). * Bike lane, sometimes referred to as segregated cycle facilities. Separating bicycle traffic from pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic is typically safer and improves traffic flow. * Bus lane, an uncongested lane for buses to travel, load, or unload in. * Emergency vehicle lane, to help emergency vehicles get to their destination as fast as possible while avoiding traffic congestion. * Taxicab lanes, most often found at airports or other transit hubs for passenger loading and unloading. * Horse and buggy lanes in areas with significant Amish populations In some cases, these lanes may serve multiple functions.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 9, 2011 river in Mendocino County, California, that flows from the northern California Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean at Mendocino, Mendocino County, California. From the mouth, brackish waters extend 8 miles (13 km) upstream, forming the longest undeveloped estuary in the state. History Pre-European contact, the lands about the Big River belonged to the Me-tum‚Äômah, or Mitom Pomo. This sub-tribe of the Northern Pomo lived in the area of Little Lake Valley near Willits and claimed the coast from south of the Noyo River at what is now Fort Bragg, to just north of the Navarro River, eighteen miles south. Big River was named for the giant redwoods that once lined its banks; it's shown as Arroyo Grande on a dise√±o of the Albion Mexican land grant of October 30, 1844. The timber industry has dominated the area since the 1850s, when the first mill was constructed in what was then known as Mendocino City (now Mendocino). The mill was constructed on the bluffs overlooking the river mouth with an apron chute to load finished wood onto ships was constructed at the mill. Splash dams were built on the river and their floodgates were opened every winter to sweep logs downstream to booms which kept the logs from floating out to sea. This method of log transport increased erosion, removed woody debris, and buried cobble substrates. Logging practices especially impacted the estuary, which served as a mill pond from 1852-1938. Watershed and Course The Big River watershed drains , from the northern California Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean at the town of Mendocino, about 10 miles south of Fort Bragg. The Big River watershed borders the watersheds of the Noyo River to the north, the Eel and Russian rivers to the east, and the Little, Albion, and Navarro rivers to the south. The river's headwaters start in the Mendocino Range, part of the California Coast Range at an elevation of approximately 2800 ft (865m), inland from the Pacific Ocean. The headwaters are partially fed by Montgomery Creek as it flows through the upland riparian habitat and virgin redwoods of Montgomery Woods State Reserve. From there, the river flows roughly west through Jackson Demonstration State Forest. The lower portions of the river pass through Mendocino Woodlands State Park and the Big River Unit of Mendocino Headlands State Park before reaching the mouth of the river at the Pacific Ocean just south of the town of Mendocino. The Big River Estuary is the longest undeveloped estuary in the state. From the mouth, ocean salinities reach upstream in the summer and in the winter, when freshwater flows are greatest. The estuary has long been of conservation interest for its beauty and natural resources. The U.S Fish and Wildlife Service nominated the estuary for protection in 1980 under the Unique and Nationally Significant Wildlife Ecosystem Program. Although the nomination did not garner the desired protections, the estuary did receive protection in 2002, when the Mendocino Land Trust purchased a 7,334 acre parcel from the Hawthorne Timber Company. The land was donated to California State Parks as part of the Mendocino Headlands State Park. In 2010, the estuary waters were designated as a State Marine Conservation Area under the Marine Life Protection Act. Habitat and ecology The Big River is fed by precipitation, 90 percent of which falls between October and April. Annual precipitation averages on the coast at Fort Bragg and inland at Willits. Winter weather is characterized by low intensity rain. The summers are dry and cool, with coastal fog. The river provides recreation and groundwater recharge for agricultural and industrial water use for the community of Mendocino, California.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B July 1975 p.13 The Big River provides wetland habitat for wildlife and cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning. The anadromous salmonid populations native to the Big River are all listed as endangered or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. These include: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other native fishes include the anadromous Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), sculpins (Cottus spp.), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and the Sacramento sucker (Castomus occidentalis). The Big River Estuary provides essential wetland habitat and has potential to provide critical salmonid habitat. The strong marine influences in the Big River Estuary are tied to a diversity of fishes. Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasi) lay their eggs in the estuary, shiner surfperch (Cymatogaster aggregata) and Bay Pipefish (Syngnathus leptorhynchus) give birth in the estuary, and juvenile English Sole (Pleuronectes vetulus) and copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) migrate to the estuary to rear. Many marine fish species also enter the estuary seasonally to feed, such as night smelt (Spirinchus starski), while a variety of coastal species pass in and out of the estuary year-round, including cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus), tidepool sculpin (Oligocottus maculosus), and kelp greenling (Hexogrammos decagrammus). California golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) were restored to Big River in the early to mid-twentieth century despite extirpation in the California Fur Rush of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. A specimen was collected by J. G. Hall east of Mendocino on the Big River at elevation (precise location 39.31148, -123.6396) in 1966 for the California Academy of Sciences mammal collection. Beaver ponds help restore salmonid habitat by capturing sediment and improving water quality, providing pools for juvenile salmonid over- summering, raising water tables which recharge streams in the dry season, increasing the area of aquatic and riparian habitat providing fish cover, and attenuating flashy storm flows. A recent comprehensive literature review of the effects of beaver impoundments on fish illustrates that loss of beavers was directly related to significant population declines of now threatened or endangered California salmonids, including three species listed under the Endangered Species Act: Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (endangered), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (threatened) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) (threatened). Other semi-aquatic mammals living in Big River include river otter (Lontra canadensis) and mink (Neovison vison). Land Use Timber production is the primary land use in the area. The California Lumber Company built the first sawmill on the Mendocino County coast at the mouth of the river in 1852. By 1873, the name had changed to Mendocino Lumber Company and the mill was the most important in Mendocino County. The mill operated until 1931, and was briefly reopened in 1938 to mill logs salvaged when a log raft broke up off the coast. Logs were transported either to the mill pond during annual water release at the splash dams, or directly to the mill via a railway that extended up the Big River. The North Fork Big River was logged by the Caspar Lumber Company. Logs were transported to the sawmill in Caspar from Camp 20 at California State Route 20 (milepost MEN 17.3) by Caspar, South Fork and Eastern Railroad. Caspar Lumber Company timberlands became the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in 1955. Jackson State Forest forms roughly a third of the area in the watershed, and land owned by Mendocino Redwood Company, Pioneer Resources, Hawthorne Timber Company and Weger Holdings make up most of the rest. As with most watersheds on the northern California Coast, the most significant ecological problem in the area is increased erosion caused by logging, leading to excessive sedimentation in the river and its tributaries. Consequestly, the Big River has been listed as sediment and temperature impaired since 2003 under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Legacy log jams also continue to block upstream migration for spawning salmonids. Current management of the Big River watershed aims to improve salmonid habitat while maintaining timber harvest through improved timber harvest practices. Modern timber harvest practices and regular road maintenance have led to reduced sedimentation and allowed continued harvest in 55% of the watershed. .

He was born in Jamaica to an English father and enslaved mother. As a child he traveled to the United States with his father and received a formal education, becoming the first African American to graduate from Hebron Academy and Bowdoin College. As a young man, Russwurm moved from Portland, Maine, to New York City, where he was a founder with Samuel Cornish of the abolitionist newspaper, Freedom's Journal, the first paper owned and operated by African Americans. Russwurm became supportive of the American Colonization Society's efforts to develop a colony for African Americans in Africa, and he moved in 1829 to what became Liberia. In 1836 Russwurm was selected as governor of Maryland in Africa, a small colony set up nearby by the Maryland State Colonization Society. He served there until his death. The colony was annexed to Liberia in 1857. Early years Russwurm was born in Port Antonio, Jamaica in 1799, the mixed-race son of an English merchant fatherSagarin (1970), p. 14. and an unknown black slave mother. The family stayed in Jamaica until 1807, when Russwurm was sent to Quebec. In 1812, father and son moved to Portland, Maine, where the elder Russwurm married widow Susan Blanchard in 1813. Blanchard (now Russwurm) insisted her husband acknowledge \\"John Brown\\", as the boy was then known, and grant him his surname. He did so. \\"John Brown Russwurm\\" lived with his father, stepmother, and her children from a previous marriage, accepted as part of the family.

Graduating in his early twenties, he taught at an African-American school in Boston. Several years later he relocated to Maine to live with his stepmother and her new husband. They helped Russwurm pay for further education when he enrolled in Bowdoin College in 1824. Upon graduation in 1826, Russwurm became the first African American to graduate from Bowdoin College and third African American to graduate from an American college. Career =Editor of Freedom's Journal= Russwurm moved to New York City in 1827. The New York City of their day boasted the largest population of Blacks in any Northern city--an estimated 15,000, which was 10 percent of the 150,000 free \\"colored\\" people living in the North. By the early 1800s, these free Blacks and escaped slaves, who lived in a segregated world, had developed their own churches, schools and clubs. In a country that kept 90 percent of Black people in bondage, these institutions provided more than social outlets, they meant survival. On March 16 of that year, twenty-seven-year-old Russwurm, along with his co-editor Samuel Cornish, published the first edition of Freedom's Journal, an abolitionist newspaper dedicated to opposition of slavery. Freedom's Journal was the first newspaper in the United States to be owned, operated, published and edited by African Americans. During his tenure as editor, Russwurm regularly included material about ancient and modern African history, providing readers on both sides of the Atlantic with a curated source of information about the continent. The literary education Russwurm provided in the Herald also included canonical texts of an English literary education. In the poetry column of this first issue, for example, he reprinted ‚ÄúPrediction of the Origin of Rome,‚Äù an excerpt from John Ring.When Cornish resigned from the paper in September 1827, Russwurm used his position to advocate for voluntary emigration of Black people from the United States to Africa. Although such ideas were unpopular with many in the Black leadership, and despite Russwurm's reservations about the American Colonization Society's racist tendencies, Russwurm believed that Black people were more likely to prosper in Africa than in the United States. As a result, Russwurm resigned as editor in March 1829 and emigrated to Liberia. Cornish, who rejected emigration, started a new paper, The Rights of All.James 2010, p39-40 Freedom's Journal may have only lasted two years, but it quickly opened the door for a wave of Black newspapers. By the time the CIvil War started, there were more than 40 Black-owned and -operated newspapers in the United States. =Emigration to Liberia= Upon emigrating to Liberia, Russwurm started work as the colonial secretary for the American Colonization Society, serving from 1830 to 1834. He worked as the editor of the Liberia Herald. He resigned this post in 1835 to protest America's colonization policies. Russwurm wanted to exercise power in the political arena, and felt that Liberia offered him that opportunity while the United States did not. Furthermore, because the United States was not the land of his birth, he did not feel any strong allegiance to it. Russwurm also served as the superintendent of education in Liberia's capital, Monrovia. In 1836 he became the first black governor of Maryland in Africa, a colony that later became part of Liberia in 1857. He held this post until his death in 1851. He continued to encourage immigration of African Americans to the Republic of Maryland, and supported its development of agriculture and trade. During his time in Liberia, Russwurm learned several of the native languages. He encouraged trade and diplomatic relations with neighboring countries as well as with European nations. Personal life In 1833 he married Sarah McGill, the daughter of the Lieutenant-Governor of Monrovia. They had a daughter and three sons. In 1850, shortly before his death, Russwurm returned to Maine for a visit, bringing two of his sons with him. They were enrolled at North Yarmouth Academy between 1850 and 1852, and lived with his stepmother, Susan Russwurm Hawes. He had stayed close with her after his father's death years before. Legacy A statue of John Russwurm was erected at his burial site at Harper, Cape Palmas, Liberia. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed John Brown Russwurm on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

They consist of pondok, mosque, santri, teaching of classical Islamic texts and Kyai.Zamakhsyari Dhofier The Pesantren Tradition: A Study of the Role of the Kyai in the Maintenance of the Traditional Ideology of Islam in Java Tempe, AZ: Arizona State University Program for Southeast Asian Studies Monograph Series. According to one popular tradition, the pesantren education system originated from traditional Javanese pondokan; dormitories; ashram for Hindu or viharas for Buddhists to learn religious philosophies, martial arts and meditation. Institutions much like them are found across the Islamic world and are called pondok in Malaysia and Southern Thailand and madrasa Islamia (Islamic madrasa) in India and Pakistan and much of the Arabic speaking world. Pesantren aim to deepen knowledge of the Qur æƒÅn, particularly through the study of Arabic, traditions of exegesis, the Sayings of the Prophet, law and logic. The term pesantren derives from the root word santri or student -- pe- santri-an or the place of the santriRonald Lukens-Bull 2005 A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, Pp. 48 As social institutions, pesantren have played a major role over the centuries. They emphasise cores values of sincerity, simplicity, individual autonomy, solidarity and self-control. Young men and women are separated from their families, which contributes to a sense of individual commitment to the faith and close bonding to a teacher. Description Dutch colonial period. Most 'pesantren' provide housing or dormitory living at low or no cost for the students (Santri). The two type of educations systems are conducted throughout the day. Students in pesantren have almost 20 hours activities starting from early morning prayer starting at 4 am to midnight where they ended the evening with a study group in the dormitory. During the day, students attend formal school (which is mandatory until secondary school by 2005) like any other students outside of pesantren, and in late afternoon and evening they have to attend religious ritual followed by religious studies and group studies to complete their homework. Pesantren are provided to Indonesian citizens at low cost; although today some modern pesantren charge higher fees than previously, they are still significantly cheaper than non- pesantren educational institutions. The traditional pattern was for students to work in the headmaster's rice fields in exchange for food, shelter, and education. All pesantren are led by a group of teachers and religious leaders known as Kyai. The Kyai is respected as teacher and devout man. Kyai also play important roles in the community as a religious leader and in recent years as a political figure. There are Kyai families that have a long history of serving in this role. Some contemporary Kyai are the grandsons and great- grandsons of famous historical figures who established well known pesantren. Starting in the second half of the twentieth century, some pesantren started adding secular subjects to their curriculum as a way of negotiating modernity. The addition of state recognized curricula has affected traditional pesantren in a number of ways. It has led to greater control by the national government. It has also restricted the number of hours available for the traditional subjects making for difficult decisions. Many pesantren leaders have decided that the training of religious leaders is not their sole purpose and are now satisfied to graduate young men and women who have the morality of Kyai.Ronald Lukens-Bull 2000 \\"Teaching Morality: Javanese Islamic Education in a Globalizing Era\\" Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies. Vol. 3:26-48. The reduction of hours available to now master two curricula has led to practical changes. While it is still possible for the children of the poor to work in the Kyai's economic ventures (more than just rice fields these days), most parents will pay both room and board and small tuition. The time that used to be spent working, is now spent in secular education. Pesantren curriculum has four possible components: * traditional religious education, called ngaji; * government recognized curricula (there are two different types to choose from); * vocational skills training; * character development. Pesantren differ to the degree that they engage each of these components; however, all feel that character development for the students is the defining characteristic of any pesantren.Ronald Lukens-Bull 2005 A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Pp.47-70 Through curricular redesign pesantren people engage in a process of (re)imagining modernity. Modernity must be first imagined as potentially dangerous in terms of the morals that often accompany it. It must then be imagined as redeemable, that it can be detached from one set of \\"problematic\\" morals and reattached to Islamic morality.Ronald Lukens-Bull 2001 \\"Two Sides of the Same Coin: Modernity and Tradition in Indonesian Islamic Education.\\" Anthropology and Education Quarterly. 32(3):350-372. One prominent pesantren figure in Indonesia is Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), a former President of Indonesia. He was well educated in pesantren during his youth and grown up as a grandson of a Kyai, the founder of one of Indonesian religious political organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama. Gus Dur himself was the head of this organization from 1984 until 1999. After his term as President of Indonesia, Gus Dur returned to teaching in his pesantren in Ciganjur.Greg Barton, 2002.

The character, the first ethnic Chinese Bond girl, has received critical acclaim, being widely regarded as one of the best Bond girls in the series. Kin-Yan Szeto, author of The Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora: Ang Lee, John Woo, and Jackie Chan in Hollywood, wrote that the actress's \\"persona\\" was the \\"tough martial arts/action heroine [Yeoh] had established in Hong Kong cinema.\\" Appearances =Film= Wai Lin is a spy for the Chinese People's External Security Force in the rank of colonel and skilled in martial arts. She first encounters Bond when she is sent (under the disguise as a Xinhua News Agency reporter) to investigate the disappearance of stealth material from a People's Liberation Army base which is connected to media mogul Elliot Carver, who plans to start a war between China and the United Kingdom. She later learns that Bond was sent by MI-6 to work on the same case. The two initially believe they have been ordered to kill each other, but eventually develop a wary mutual trust when they are both captured by Carver. Bond grows to respect her when she playfully, but firmly, rejects his attempts at seduction. Bond and Lin sneak about Carver's private ship and they work together to destroy the ship and disable a missile that was targeted at China. She and Bond then give in to the mutual attraction they had both been fighting during the mission. (Êú±ËÄÄÂÅâ), author of Lost in Transition: Hong Kong Culture in the Age of China, wrote that the film and its promotional materials \\"incessantly highlighted\\" the character's \\"Chineseness\\". =Other appearances= In the film's novelization by Raymond Benson, Wai Lin has an entire chapter devoted to introduce her character, detailing \\"her involvement with the Chinese People's External Security Force, her training, her skills, and many other facets of her life that made her a real person. Her relationship with Bond is also much more realistic.\\" In the 1999 video game adaptation of the film, Wai Lin is both a playable (Mission 9: Market District, Saigon) and a non-playable character (Mission 10: Stealth Boat, Ha Long Bay). A one/sixth scale action figure of her was released by Sideshow Collectibles in 2001. In early scripts for Die Another Day, Wai Lin was to make a return, aiding Bond in Hong Kong (if this had happened, Wai Lin would have been only the second Bond Girl in history to appear in two films). However, this idea fell through so Wai Lin was replaced by Chinese Intelligence agent Mr. Chang (played by Ho Yi) in the finished film). Reception The character was very well-received. After the film's release, Wai Lin proved so popular with fans and critics that MGM abortively considered developing a spin-off film based on her. Life named Wai Lin the 11th best Bond girl of all time. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked her as the seventh best Bond girl, calling this \\"savvy Chinese agent\\" one of the few \\"wom[e]n of color to match wits with 007\\" and \\"the first one you could take seriously.\\" In 2012, the International Business Times included Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin among the top ten \\"most stunning\\" Bond girls of all time.

The house pictured on the album cover was the house in which the Parton family lived during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Content Largely a concept album about her childhood in rural East Tennessee, the album begins with a recitation of the first letter Parton wrote to her parents shortly after moving from her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee to Nashville in 1964. Most of the songs are fond reminiscences of her youth and family, though in one song, \\"In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)\\", Parton candidly admits that though she is grateful for the lessons the poverty of her childhood taught her, she is in no hurry to repeat the experience. The final cut on the album, \\"Down on Music Row\\", recounts her first days on Nashville's Music Row, trying to get a record deal, and thanking those who helped her along the way, making specific mention of Chet Atkins and RCA's Bob Ferguson.  Reception  In a positive review of the album, Billboard said, \\"This is an autobiography, from start to finish. Telling musically what has happened in Dolly's life, her relationships with her family and friends, her career, etc. A little out of the ordinary and her devotees will love it.

The municipality ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. History Germantown Township occupied the area known as the Germantown Tract surveyed by Thomas Holmes in 1683, and depicted on his map of about 1687. That survey was prepared for Francis Daniel Pastorius, agent for the Frankfurt Land Company, and thirteen German families, known as the \\"Original Thirteen Families\\", from Krefeld, Germany and nearby areas. Board of directors for the Frankfurt Land Company included Jacobus van der Walle, Johann Jacob Schutz, Johann Wilhelm Ueberfeld, Daniel Behagel, George Strauss, Jan Leureiss, Abram Hasevoet. They had purchased a total of 2,675 acres (11 km¬≤) of land. The intent of the Frankfurt Land Company was to send German Settlers to settle their Pennsylvania lands. In the end, they sent no settlers, and none of the directors ever came themselves. The Settlers from Krefeld had obtained a similar sized parcel, and arrived on the ship Concord, on 6 October 1683, and almost immediately began to clear their land. Additional settlers would begin arriving the following spring. The Germantown Tract was divided into four settlements, including: Germantown, and the villages of Cresheim, Sommerhausen and Crefelt, laid out in sequence from the south east to the northwest. The villages were named after the hometowns of some of the earliest settlers. The later three villages eventually combined to form the \\"Upper Ward\\" of Germantown Township. The Town of Germantown became known simply as the Borough of Germantown. The greatest length of the Germantown Township was 5¬Ω miles; the greatest breadth, ; area, 7,040 acres (28 km¬≤). The township was bounded on the northwest and northeast by Springfield Township, Montgomery County on the northeast partly by Bristol Township; on the southeast by Penn Township and Roxborough Township. Within Germantown Township were the settlements known as Germantown, Cresheim (afterwards Mount Airy), Sommerhausen (later called Chestnut Hill) and Crevelt, a rural section north of Chestnut Hill.

Description It is a perennial plant growing to 0.3‚Äì0.9 m (1‚Äì3 feet) tall, with clustered greenish-yellow flowers with maroon highlights. It blooms from April through June. Taxonomy Asclepias asperula is divided into two subspecies: asperula and capricornu (also known as var. decumbens), with the latter occurring in moister conditions and having wider leaves. Subspecies asperula occurs in drier and hotter habitat, thus its narrower leaves and lower maximum height. Image:Asclepias_asperula_6.jpgSubspecies asperula Image:Asclepias_asperula.jpgSubspecies capricornu Ecology Like several other species of milkweed, A. asperula is a food for monarch butterfly caterpillars. Along with being a source of nutrition for monarchs, the plants also contain toxic cardiac glycosides (Cardenolides) that the monarchs retain, making them unpalatable and poisonous to predators. For the same reason, A. asperula can be poisonous to livestock and other animals, including humans. In addition to the monarch, it is a larval host to the dogbane tiger moth, the queen butterfly, and the unexpected cycnia.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Cultivation In cultivation, this species favors quickly-draining soil that is higher in inorganic matter, such as sand and rock chips. It can grow in loam and clay, if provided with adequate drainage and frequent-enough dryness. Moisture level demands and tolerance depend upon the subspecies and possibly ecotype.

Biography John S. Savage was born in Clermont County, Ohio to James and Frances (Battson) Savage. James Savage was a school teacher and later a farmer. John was educated in the local public schools and in 1853 relocated to Clinton County, Ohio where he took up his father‚Äôs early vocation. During his five years of teaching, he devoted his spare time to the study of law and, in 1865, he was admitted to the Ohio bar. That same year he was also admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Illinois. Savage opened a law office at Wilmington, Ohio, in partnership with Simeon G. Smith. Their firm, Savage & Smith, was well known in the county. On December 31, 1868 Savage married Lydia Ayers, a native of Clinton county; they had four children. Savage was a Democrat, casting his first vote for George B. McClellan in 1864. His election to Congress was wholly unsought--he accepted the nomination more to aid in maintaining the organization of his party than in the expectation of being elected. Ohio's third congressional district was overwhelmingly Republican, yet Savage defeated his incumbent opponent John Q. Smith by 1,162 votes. At the succeeding congressional election in 1876, he was narrowly defeated by Mills Gardner, who also served a single term. Savage resumed the practicing law in Wilmington. He was a Freemason, of the Knights Templar degree. He died in Wilmington and his remains are interred at the Sugar Grove Cemetery. Sources * History of Clinton County, Ohio. Chicago: W. H.

Orange line depicts the extent of areas occupied by Soviet Union in 1939-1941 Poland was invaded and annexed by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the invasion of Poland in 1939. In the pre-war Polish territories annexed by the Soviets (Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, Lithuania and Bia≈Çystok regions, known to Poles as \\"Kresy\\") the first Soviet partisan groups were formed in 1941, soon after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Those groups fought against the Germans, but conflicts with Polish partisans were also common. Early war Initially the Soviet partisan groups were formed primarily in the areas of Nowogr√≥dek (modern Navahrudak), Lida and Wilno (modern Vilnius) from Red Army soldiers who evaded capture by the advancing German forces. Lacking support from the local population, the Soviet partisan groups retreated to various large forest complexes in the area, where they hid from the German rear and anti-partisan units.Review of Sowjetische Partisanen in Wei√üru√üland by Bogdan Musial, by Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, in Sarmatian Review, April 2006 There were also Soviet-affiliated and controlled groups, namely Gwardia Ludowa, later transformed into Armia Ludowa, which while often described as parts of the Polish resistance, were de facto controlled by Soviets, and as such can also be seen as extensions of the Soviet partisans. By the end of July 1944 (when much of Poland had been occupied by the Red Army) Armia Ludowa had some 20,000‚Äì30,000 members,(in Polish) Armia Ludowa Archived 12 May 2014 at the Wayback Machine in Encyklopedia PWN 5,000 of them being Soviet nationals.Yohanan Cohen (1989). Small nations in times of crisis and confrontation. SUNY Press. p. 100\\\\. . Retrieved 6 January 2012. Until early 1943, the Soviet partisans focused primarily on survival deep behind enemy lines, with their activity limited mostly to sabotage and diversion rather than armed struggle against German forces and collaborationist police units. During this early period various Soviet partisan groups also collaborated with the local Polish resistance of ZWZ, later renamed the AK. The Polish underground was established in the area in the fall 1939. Polish resistance was both anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet; their attitude represented the fact that both powers had invaded Poland, and Polish citizens suffered from Soviet terror just as they did from Nazi terror. There was no love lost between Polish and Soviet resistances, as Joseph Stalin's goal was to prevent a reemergence of an independent Poland after the war.Judith Olsak-Glass, Review of Piotrowski's Poland's Holocaust in Sarmatian Review, January 1999. Late war As the eastern front approached the area, and diplomatic relations between the Polish government in exile and the Soviet Union were broken off in the aftermath of the discovery of the Katyn Massacre in April 1943, most of the collaboration between Polish and Soviet partisans came to an end. In addition, as ordered by Moscow on June 22, 1943,Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust, McFarland & Company, 1997, , Google Print, p.98-99 Soviet partisans began an open conflict against both the German forces and local Polish partisans. Soviet partisans attacked Polish partisans, villages and small towns in order to weaken the Polish structures in the areas which Soviet Union claimed for itself. P. 230 Frequent requisitions of food in local villages and brutal reprisal actions against villages considered disloyal to the Soviet Union sparked the creation of numerous self-defence units, often joining the ranks of the Armia Krajowa. Similar assaults on the Polish resistance organizations also took place in the Ukraine. Communist propaganda called the Polish resistance the \\"bands of White Poles\\", or \\"the prot√©g√©s of the Gestapo.\\" On 23 June 1943 the Soviet leaders ordered the partisans to denounce Polish partisan to the Nazis. The Soviet units were authorized to ‚Äúshoot the [Polish] leaders‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscredit, disarm, and dissolve‚Äù their units. Under pretences of cooperation, two sizable Polish partisan units were led to their destruction (a common strategy involved inviting the Polish commanders to negotiations, arresting or murdering them and attacking the Polish partisans by surprise). In late 1943, the actions of Soviet partisans, who were ordered to liquidate the AK forces resulted in very limited and uneasy cooperation between some units of the AK and the Germans.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust, McFarland & Company, 1997, . Google Print, p.88, p.89, p.90 While the AK treated the Germans as the enemy and continued to conduct operations against them, when the Germans offered the AK some arms and provisions to be used against the Soviet partisans, some Polish units in the Nowogr√≥dek and Wilno areas decided to accept them. However any such arrangements were purely tactical and did not constitute evidence of the type of ideological collaboration as was shown by the Vichy regime in France, the Quisling regime in Norway or closer to the region, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The Poles' main motivation was to gain intelligence on German morale and preparedness, and to acquire some badly needed weapons.Review by John Radzilowski of Yaffa Eliach's Big Book of Holocaust Revisionism, Journal of Genocide Research, vol. 1, no. 2 (June 1999), City University of New York. There are no known joint Polish-German military actions, and the Germans were unsuccessful in their attempts to turn the Poles toward fighting exclusively against Soviet partisans. Such cooperation of local Polish commanders with the Germans was condemned by the AK High Command and the Polish Supreme Commander in London, who on January 17, 1944, ordered it to be discontinued and the guilty parties disciplined. The armed struggle continued until the arrival of the Red Army in 1944 and well after. Subsequently, over the period of the next few years, the Soviets and Polish communists would work to successfully eradicate the remains of the anti-Soviet Polish underground, known as the cursed soldiers.Andrzej Kaczy≈Ñski, Rzeczpospolita, 02.10.04 Nr 232, Wielkie polowanie: Prze≈õladowania akowc√≥w w Polsce Ludowej (Great hunt: the persecutions of AK soldiers in the People's Republic of Poland), last accessed on 7 June 2006 . Relations with the civilian population Outside pre-1939 Soviet territories, Soviet partisans encountered little support and often significant hostility from local populations, and so unable to acquire supplies from otherwise, they engaged in plunder and terrorised the inhabitants. \\"Forms of constraint applied by the Soviet authorities in relation to the people of Wilejka region\\". Professor Franciszek Sielicki. Wroc≈Çawskie Studia Wschodnie, Wroc≈Çaw, 1997 Villagers couldn't stand Soviet partisans because they conducted shameful robberies. They stole whatever they could, even children's toys. One doesn't even have to mention that they stole horses, cows, pigs, underwear, etc. There were many cases, when faced with resistance, they hanged poor peasants by their legs, upside down, to force them into giving something. Behind Willa, in forests and swamps, they formed new units constantly ‚Äì otriads, which oppressed our villages In some cases, Germans allowed peasants to form self-defense units against Soviet raids, which in extreme cases led to violent clashes between the Soviet partisans and local peasants, resulting in civilian casualties, as was the case with the Koniuchy massacre in Polish-Lithuanian borderland in 1944. Bogdan Musial argued that the Soviet partisans preferred to assault the less challenging Belarusian and Polish self-defense units rather than German military and police targets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets could claim a significant victory in what they called their war against the bourgeois Poles: most large landed estates owned by the Poles had been destroyed by the Soviet partisans.

He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a diminutive college student and later a physicist, usually depicted as a \\"tough-guy\\" character. Publication history The Atom first appeared in All-American Comics #19 (Oct. 1940) and was created by writer Bill O'Connor and artist Ben Flinton. The character continued to appear on and off through issue #72 (April 1946). In 1947, the Atom moved from All-American Comics to Flash Comics with issue #80 (Feb 1947), and continued until issue #104 (Feb 1949). In winter 1940, the Atom also began appearing in All Star Comics as a member of the Justice Society of America, beginning with issue #3. He continued with that team until issue #57 (Feb 1951). Fictional character biography =Golden Age= Initially a proverbial 98-pound weakling, bullied at school and unable to impress the girl of his dreams, Mary James, the Al Pratt was trained to fighting condition by ex-boxer Joe Morgan (the same man who trained Pratt's fellow mystery men, Wildcat and the Guardian). Pratt soon became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, appearing in the team's various stories during their original Golden Age appearances. In All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940), the Atom describes himself to his fellow JSAers as \\"Al Pratt, a quiet sophomore at Calvin College\\". He later became a founding and active member of the All-Star Squadron. During World War II, Pratt served as a tank driver for the United States Army. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, the Atom \\"fights the Emperor of America, agents of the Black Dragon Society, and the Carnival of Crime, in addition to the Cootie Gang, Mandini the Magician and the scavenger Undersea Raiders\\". In 1948, the Atom gained super strength as a result of the latent effects of his 1942 battle with the reluctant supervillain Cyclotron (after whose costume Pratt redesigned his own). It was later revealed that he had taken partial custodianship of Cyclotron's daughter, Terri. Pratt's last Golden Age appearance was in All Star Comics #57 in 1951, also the last Golden Age Justice Society story. Later it was revealed that a special Senate investigation panel had moved to obtain the identities of all active superheroes, at which point virtually all members of the Justice Society retired. At this point in his life, as depicted in JSA #70, Pratt was engaged to Mary James, leading to their marriage at an undefined point in time (as confirmed by Justice Society of America: The Kingdom Special and others). =Later years= Pratt was revived with the rest of the team in 1963 in Flash vol. 1, #137, and continued to make various appearances in the years that followed. The Atom comic book, showcasing the adventures of Ray Palmer, brought the Atom of Earth-2 together with the Atom of Earth-1. Issue #29 (1967) depicts Al Pratt as living in Calvin City and as being a professor at Calvin College; he also possesses a modified automobile that transforms from an ordinary convertible to the Atomobile. In this story it is Ray Palmer who builds a \\"special dimensional vibrator\\" that allows travel between the two Earths. The villain in this adventure is The Thinker. In issue #36 (1968) Al Pratt is specifically named a professor of nuclear physics at Calvin College. Built into the belt of his Atom uniform is his own \\"atomic vibrator\\" which allows travel between the Earths. Al is depicted as a young-looking man who is \\"so busy as the Atom\\" that he \\"sort of let romance pass [him] by\\". Shown also are his friends Bill and Betty Roberts, as well as his first meeting with Marion Thayer on a double date. It is unknown what had happened to Marion Thayer, but in DC Comics Presents #30 (Feb. 1981), Pratt's wife Mary resembles the blonde Thayer more than the brunette James. The Atom's status with the Justice Society of America was as a reserve member up until after the formation of Infinity, Inc. Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Last Days of the Justice Society Special (1986) told how Pratt, along with his teammates, prevented the unleashing of Ragnar√∂k, a time-displaced and world-shattering event initiated by Adolf Hitler originally on April 12, 1945. In order to stave off the destruction of the world, Al and the others chose to enter a magical limbo - seemingly for all eternity. The 1992 miniseries Armageddon: Inferno brought Al Pratt and the other members of the JSA back into the post-Crisis world. The short-lived series Justice Society of America (1992‚Äì1993) told the tale of the team's reintegration into society. Al was depicted as a short, stocky, balding man with radioactive, super-powered hands and a body aged to about 60 years or so. He was also written as a man more interested in training the next generation of heroes than \\"running off on crazy super-hero missions\\" (issue #2), though he still was hotheaded. It was revealed that Mary died while the JSA was trapped in the Ragnarok dimension, and that Al was naturally upset he never got to say goodbye. The series brought Al and the JSA into conflict with the Ultra-Humanite, Pol St. Germain, and Kulak the Sorcerer. The Justice Society had been on active duty only briefly when 1994's Zero Hour miniseries depicted Al Pratt's murder by the temporal villain Extant, who increased his temporal rate, aging him to death. =Legacy= In the 1980s, Al Pratt's godson Al Rothstein was introduced; Rothstein was known as the superhero Nuklon (later changing his name to Atom Smasher), first appearing as a member of Infinity, Inc. In 1994, it was revealed that Pratt had a son named Grant Emerson. Al Pratt was unaware of this - he had been told that there were complications with childbirth and that the child had not survived, but Al's wife was suffocated by the villain Vandal Savage, who kidnapped Grant and genetically altered him into a superbeing. After the onset of puberty, he became the superhero Damage. Damage later appeared in two incarnations of the Teen Titans, eventually joined the Freedom Fighters, and then became a member of the Justice Society of America, until his death during Blackest Night. It was initially believed that the modern Manhunter Kate Spencer is his granddaughter. However, Kate is in fact the granddaughter of Phantom Lady and Iron Munro. Al Pratt allowed Sandra Knight (the Phantom Lady) to use his contact information in order to enter a home for unwed mothers, which led to the mix-up. In the afterlife, the Atom also befriended the recently deceased Starman, David Knight. In dreams, David brought his brother, the next Starman, Jack Knight to a banquet in limbo attended by Atom and several other deceased mystery men.Starman vol. 2 #37. DC Comics. In the Blackest Night crossover, Al Pratt was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, to attack the Justice Society and his sons Damage and Atom Smasher.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009). DC Comics.Blackest Night #4 (October 2009).

DC Comics. In the pages of \\"Dark Nights: Death Metal,\\" Al Pratt is revealed to be entombed in the Valhalla Cemetery.Dark Nights: Death Metal #2. DC Comics. Powers and abilities During his early days of crime fighting, Pratt possessed no superhuman qualities. Instead, he was a particularly adept combatant with a strength level disproportionate to his size. After being exposed to Cyclotron's energies, Al Pratt gained superhuman strength, agility, and was able to focus radioactive energy into a punch. In addition, Atom was invulnerable to certain forms of radiation. He also gained extended youth and vitality after the battle with Ian Karkull. Other versions =JSA: The Golden Age= In the Elseworlds story JSA: The Golden Age, Al Pratt was summoned by Tex Thompson for a test subject for the superhero of the atomic age project. He was rejected due to the nature of his atomic-based abilities which would've poisoned Adolf Hitler. Though Al was hired to work in the recruitment offices of Federal Bureau of Supeheroes.Golden Age #1-4. DC Comics. =Justice Society Infinity= On Earth-2, Al Pratt is an active member of the Justice Society of America after it became the Justice Society Infinity alongside his godson Nuklon. The Justice Society Infinity had an encounter with Power Girl when she ended up on their world and Atom learned from her that his godson's counterpart went by the name Atom Smasher. Power Girl couldn't bring herself to let Atom know that her world's Al Pratt is dead.Justice Society of America Annual Vol. 3 #1. DC Comics. =Earth 2= In 2011, The New 52 rebooted the continuity of the DC Universe. Al was reintroduced in the Earth 2 ongoing series as a U.S. Sergeant. He was in charge of a squad carrying an atomic bomb meant to neutralize an Apokoliptian tower responsible for transporting Parademons to Earth. His squad however is attacked while en route to the tower and the bomb is detonated. Al is later found unharmed in the center of a giant hand print in the ground. Five years later, Al has become a captain in the World Army and is operating as a superhero codenamed \\"the Atom\\", wearing a costume similar to his son Damage while possessing the atomic energy powers of his original counterpart and the size-changing powers. Al is deployed as the Atom to take down Grundy who is rampaging across Washington DC. After dropping mid air from his transport, Al enlarges and lands on Grundy, ordering the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkgirl to stand down.Earth 2 #6. DC Comics. During the fight with Superman's clone Brutaal, Atom loses his right arm after helping Sandman evacuate some civilians.Earth 2 #26. DC Comics. After spending time in a medically-induced coma, Atom took part in one final mission. This mission involved him being dropped into a hole where he expanded it to create an underground cavern for Earth 2's survivors as the cost of his life. Once that was done, Atom shrunk back to his normal size before he passed away. The survivors honored his sacrifice by calling the location Atom's Haven.Earth 2: World's End #13. DC Comics. In other media An analogue named Tom Turbine appeared in the Justice League episode \\"Legends\\" voiced by Ted McGinley. He is a homage to the Golden Age Atom, with whom he shares stature, color scheme, profession, features and a similar powerset, while also having some of Golden Age Superman's facial features. Al Pratt appears in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\" portrayed by Glenn Hoffman. He is a super hero in the 1970s and a physics professor at Calvin College, who was arrested during a student protest and framed for the crime of fraud by the government in a mission to take down the JSA. However, he was never convicted of any crime. As the law was now aware of his superhero identity, Pratt retired from heroics. By the show's present, Pratt may or may not be deceased as Doctor Fate later stated \\"The Atom split\\". A reference to him is made by Jay Garrick in the video game Injustice 2 when he is used against the Atom. He states \\"You don't look like Al Pratt\\".

In the past, Okinawa Island had railroad, trams, and horse-drawn streetcar service. Moreover, Minamidait≈çjima and other islands had rail lines to transport sugarcane and other commodities.  History  = Meiji period = The first rail line laid down in Okinawa was during the Meiji period when in 1902, in Minami Dait≈ç, a line opened with handcars. Okinawa Island's first railroad opened in 1910, for the transportation of sugar cane. = Taish≈ç period = After many false starts, rail transportation began in earnest during the Taish≈ç period. The Okinawa Electric Railway (the predecessor of Okinawa Electric Company), having received exclusive rights to this route in 1910, opened the island's first streetcar line, between Daimon-mae and Shuri (5.7 km, 1067 mm gauge, 500 V). Some months later, as an expansion of service on the sugar-cane line in Nishihara, the company introduced person-drawn service between Yonabaru and Konaha (762 mm gauge). This line would later convert to horse-drawn service. Extensions brought the rails to Awase, part of the present-day city of Okinawa (17.7 km). Meanwhile, the prefectural government, recognizing the failure of private attempts, was preparing its own line, and opened the Okinawa Prefectural Railways line between Naha and Yonabaru in December 1914. At the end of the Taish≈ç period, the prefecture completed a railway system having three lines radiating from Naha: one to Kadena, one to Yonabaru, and one to Itoman. Okinawa Electric also extended its routes. A horse-drawn trolley linking Naha and Itoman also began operations. This was the peak of the rail system in Okinawa. =Showa Period (pre-war and wartime)= Along with the development of roadways, automobile traffic increased, and railroads experienced competition from buses. Okinawa Electric responded by introducing gasoline cars, but users of their trolleys and the Itoman horse-drawn trolley line declined, and the lines were abandoned. As a result, the only lines still operating on Okinawa Island were the prefectural railway and the Okinawa Railway (the former Okinawa horse-drawn line). Both ceased operations in 1944-1945, and aerial bombardment and the ensuing ground war devastated the rail systems. =Showa period (postwar) and Heisei Period= Under the American Occupation, the road system of Okinawa developed markedly, and the prefectural railway and the Okinawa trolley line disappeared. The industrial rail systems disappeared, too, with the exception of the Minami Daito sugar- cane line, which returned to operation and continued to operate until 1983. After the return of Okinawa to Japanese administration in 1972, the prefecture considered plans to develop rail lines, and opened the Okinawa Monorail in August, 2003. A people mover operated within the grounds of the Expo '75, the Okinawa International Maritime Exposition, from July 20, 1975 to January 18, 1976. The 1.4 km line connected North Gate Station and South Gate Station, making an intermediate stop at International Plaza Station. Lines =Okinawa Electric Railway and Okinawa Electric Company= Saiga Tokichi, operator of Saiga Electric Company of Kyoto, established Okinawa Electric in 1909. In 1911, he established the Okinawa Electric Railway to link Naha and Shuri with a trolley line. The segment from Daimon-mae to Shuri opened in 1914, and that from Daimon-mae to Tsudo began operation in 1917. However, the line lost passengers to competition from buses, and the line ceased operations in 1933. =Okinawa Railway= Although the original intent was to transport sugar cane by handcar to the refinery in Nishihara, the line was unused in the off-season, and the operator set up a separate company to provide passenger service on the line. It opened in November 1914, providing service between Yonabaru and Konaha. In 1916 it extended its route to Awase. It ceased operations in 1944. =Itoman horse-drawn carriage line= The Itoman line directly connected Naha and Itoman by horse-drawn carriage. In June 1919 the segment from Kakihana to China opened. In May 1920, the rest of the line opened. Under competition from buses, the line lost ridership, and operations came to an end in 1935. The line formally ended in 1939. =Expo '75= From July 20, 1975 to January 18, 1976, a people mover built by Kobe Steel, operated within the grounds of Expo '75. It was the first people mover line to operate in Japan. =Minamidait≈çjima= Daito sugarcane train, now preserved at a park in Naha. The line that operated on Minamidait≈çjima is known by various names; among them are and . The first rails laid down in Okinawa, they included lines that encircled the island and others that relayed traffic to the harbor. The tracks exceeded 30 km in length. In addition to hauling sugar cane, they also conveyed passengers and mails. In the Meiji period, Minamidait≈çjima was uninhabited, but in 1900, Tamaoki Shokai began to develop the island, and started both the sugar refinery and the handcar railway in 1902. In 1917 the commercial rights passed to Toyo Sugar Refining. The railway was converted to a gauge of 762 mm and began seriously hauling sugar cane. In 1927, Toyo merged with Dainippon Sugar Refining. During World War II, aerial attacks destroyed the railway, but in 1950, Daito Sugar Refining restored it to operation. It served through the 1983 spring season, and thereafter, trucks replaced the railway for the transportation of sugar cane. The upgrade of the gauge to 762 mm permitted the use of steam locomotives, and in 1956, diesel locomotives were introduced. At present, steam and diesel locomotives, passenger and freight cars have been preserved on Minamidait≈çjima. Naha also has a diesel locomotive from the Prefectural Yohabaru Line. =Other= Sugar cane tram in Miyako Island, 1939 Prior to World War II, railways were in use in various places, but all disappeared after the war. Locations included what are present-day Nishihara, Kadena, and Itoman. The islands of Ishigaki and Miyako also had lines to move sugar cane, and Iriomote had handcar lines for the coal mines. Kita Daito and Oki Daito had similar lines for phosphate mines.  Monorail  The Okinawa Urban Monorail opened in 2003. It was designed to overcome the severe congestion on the island. Construction began in 1996 and it now extends some 13 km in the city of Naha. The monorail is a venture of the prefecture and private enterprise. There are 15 stations on the line.

The organization, now based in Manhattan,https://upatour.com ‚Äì replace this with a more specific page reference. was founded in January 2002 in Arizona by professional players,> to replace several competing and dysfunctional men's professional pool organizations which had suffered years of problems such as inability to pay out winnings or to keep a stable schedule of competitions. UPA was formerly named the United States Pool Players Association (a name some of their materials still use, sometimes with the spelling \\"Poolplayers\\", and rarely with a possessive apostrophe), and has also frequently been unofficially referred to as USPPA or USPA, especially in reference to its professional side versus its amateur UPA League operations. The organization's motto is \\"Evolve Your Game\\" (formerly \\"The Evolution of Pool\\"). The UPA Tour series of pro tournaments cover multiple pool disciplines, including eight- ball, nine-ball, ten-ball, and straight pool; the amateur UPA National Championships are team eight- and nine-ball events. The organization also offers instructional programs, and event promotion/production for pool tournaments and trade shows. On the professional side, the Billiard Congress of America (BCA, the more general governing body for cue sports in North America, primarily focused on maintaining rule sets and records), which is the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) US-national affiliate, officially recognizes the UPA as the men's pro pool competition association for the United States, making it the present counterpart of the Women's Professional Billiards Association (WPBA). On the amateur side, UPA is one of a half-dozen or so major national (and unisex) leagues. UPA League In the 2000s, UPA launched an amateur league program named the UPA League (originally the League of Champions); UPA describes it as \\"a pool league designed by professionals for the serious player.\\" While it is mostly team-based, UPA also offers singles competition, and is not gender-or age-divided, which is an unusual lack of categorization. Most distinguishing of all is that league members can use their singles match records in the league to leverage their way into formal professional play as ranked UPA Touring Professional Program (UPA Tour) members, qualified to compete in pro-only events. For example, a record of 20 UPA League singles matches within the year, and payment of the UPA Tour membership fee, qualifies a player to compete in the Vegas Championships. Like most leagues, it operates on a local franchise licensing (for-profit) basis. This is a press release (primary source), not a news story. Because the league uses a handicapping system (as found in most amateur leagues) that in UPA's case ranges from beginner to expert, professional players are actually eligible to play in the UPA League (with the maximum-skill-level handicap); this permissiveness is highly unusual in an amateur league in any sport. As in most leagues, membership is annually renewed, and active players also pay nightly dues on the nights they play (a portion of which goes into prize funds). The league has an annual national amateur championship, held in Las Vegas, Nevada (where most other large US-based leagues do the same; a single events vendor/promoter warehouses thousands of Diamond and Valley-Dynamo \\"\\" tables rented out by all of these events each year). The UPA National Championships are a week-long set of tournament brackets in various divisions, most of them team-based play but also featuring singles mini-tournaments. Originally announced/posted March 14, 2019. Various marketing materials also use the names UPA Nationals and UPA Las Vegas Nationals. The seventh annual UPA Nationals will be held June 22‚Äì28, 2020, at Binion's Casino, and offers a combined nine-ball and eight-ball prize fund of US$40,000 in the team competitions, which (depending on division) may pay out all the way down to 16th place. The dress code of the UPA Nationals is stricter than most amateur events, in that it requires matching team shirts. UPA Tour The UPA Tour (in long form, the UPA Touring Professional Program) is a professional tournament series and player ranking system with an annual membership fee. Some events have more open registrations, especially when co-organized with other bodies, and all of them are open to certain qualifying UPA League players with 20 or more singles matches played in the current year. the recent and upcoming listed UPA Tour events are: * International 9-Ball Open, October 28 ‚Äì November 2, 2019; Norfolk, Virginia * Las Vegas 10-Ball Open, March 11‚Äì14, 2020; Las Vegas, Nevada (also referred to by the promotional name Diamond Las Vegas 10-Ball Open, and co-organized with CueSports International) * U.S. Open 9-Ball Championships, April 13‚Äì18, 2020; Las Vegas (co-organized with Matchroom Sport) * Vegas Championships, June 23‚Äì25, 2020; Las Vegas (a nine-ball tournament using the smaller tables most amateur players are familiar with); UPA Tour members only; prize fund: $20,000 The organization has previously co-sponsored other noteworthy events, including the 2005 World Summit of Pool Other programs The UPA also offers pool instruction by professionals via UPA Pool School events, held primarily in Las Vegas. The organization has also sometimes provided pool-related event promotion and production, including for tournaments and vendor exhibitions.

Josef Zisyadis (born 17 April 1956) is a Swiss politician, a member of the Swiss Party of Labour, and of the Alternative Left (since 2010). Born to Greek parents in Istanbul, and after a sojourn in Athens (1958‚Äì1962), he moved to Switzerland with his family in 1962, aged seven, and was later naturalized as citizen of Lausanne. He studied theology in Lausanne, graduating in 1979. During 1979-1983 he worked as pastor in the Mission populaire √©vang√©lique in Paris, returning to Lausanne in 1983, where he joined the Parti Ouvrier Populaire of Vaud. During 1994-1996, he acted as secretary of the Party of Labour. He was a member of the Swiss National Council (1991‚Äì1996, 1999‚Äì2011) representing the Canton of Vaud. During 1996-1998, he was a member of the cantonal government of Vaud (Conseil d'Etat), heading the department of Justice, Police and Military affairs. At the October 2007 federal elections, Zisyadis failed to win reelection, however, on 1 November 2007 successful party candidate Marianne Huguenin announced her resignation from the National Council to focus on her position as mayor of Renens, leaving Zizyadis to take the Party's seat in the National Council representing Vaud. Zisyadis since the founding of the new party Alternative Left in 2010 is a member of that party, but also stays member of the Swiss Party of Labour. Zisyadis again failed to retain his mandate in the 2011 elections, his seat passing to the Social Democrats. The Alternative Left coalition gathered 1.2% of the popular vote nationwide; with the loss of Zisyadis' seat, the far-left loses all representation at the federal level.

A banned person is forbidden from employment with MLB or its affiliated minor leagues, and is forbidden from other professional involvement with MLB such as acting as a sports agent for an MLB player. Since 1991, all banned people ‚Äì whether living or deceased ‚Äì have been barred from induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Major League Baseball has maintained a list of \\"permanently ineligible\\" people since Kenesaw Mountain Landis was installed as the first Commissioner of Baseball in 1920. Although the majority of banned persons were banned after the establishment of the Commissioner's office, some were formally banned prior to that time while a few others were informally \\"blacklisted\\" by the Major League clubs. Most persons who have been banned (including many who have been reinstated) were banned due to association with gambling or otherwise conspiring to fix the outcomes of games; others have been banned for a multitude of reasons including illegal activities off the field, violating some term of their playing contract, or making disparaging remarks that cast the game in a bad light. History Kenesaw Mountain Landis, federal judge and Commissioner of Baseball (1920‚Äì44). Before 1920, players were banned by the decision of a committee. There were 14 banned from 1865 to 1920; of those, 12 were banned for association with gambling or attempting to fix games, one was banned for violating the reserve clause, and one was banned for making disparaging remarks. In 1920, team owners established the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, ostensibly to keep the players in line and out of corruption's way. Kenesaw Mountain Landis, a federal judge, was the owners' ideal candidate for the job and was given unlimited power over the game, including the authority to ban people from the game. He banned many players and various others, often for very small offenses, and at times almost indiscriminately. In his 24 years as commissioner, Landis banned more people than all of his successors combined. The last living person banned by Landis was William D. Cox, who died in 1989. As of 2019, nobody has died while still ineligible after being banned by one of Landis' successors. The oldest living person on the ineligible list is Pete Rose, who is 78 years old as of 2019. In 1991, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum voted to bar banned players from induction. In 2005, as a result of the findings of the Mitchell Report, the Major League Baseball Players Association stipulated that multiple violations of the new Major League Baseball drug policy would result in a lifetime ban. Punishment A person who has been banned from Major League Baseball is barred from: *employment with MLB, one of its affiliated minor leagues, or any Major League or Minor League Club, whether as a player, coach, or manager, or in the front office; *acting as a sports agent for any Major League or Minor League player, coach, or manager; *maintaining business ties with MLB or with any Major League or Minor League Club; **The exception to this is that MLB or any Major League or Minor League Club may invite banned persons to participate in events where said participation will not put the banned person(s) in a position where they could influence play (for example, an appearance at a public recognition ceremony). All such participation is subject to the approval of the Commissioner, who has the authority to deal with such requests on a case-by- case basis. The exact privileges that will be afforded for each special event is determined by the Commissioner ‚Äì invariably, access to the clubhouse and related facilities by banned people will not be permitted. (This exception has evolved over the decades following the banishment of MLB's all-time hit leader Pete Rose in 1989. In the early years of Rose's ban, dispensations for special events were rarely granted. In recent years, especially since incumbent Rob Manfred's assumption of the office, special event dispensations for Rose have become considerably more frequent.) *induction to the Hall of Fame, whether the person is living or deceased. **This prohibition is not the result of any MLB rule or policy (since the Hall of Fame falls outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's Office), but is a policy enforced by the Hall itself. Prior to the late 1980s, the Baseball Writers' Association of America and Veterans Committee each had an unwritten rule excluding banned people from consideration for election to the Hall. (The banishment of Rose necessitated a formalization of this policy prior to 1991 when Rose would otherwise have become eligible for election to the Hall.) Although Commissioner Bart Giamatti had stated at the time of Rose's ban that their agreement did not directly affect his Hall eligibility, he died before he could elaborate on the issue. Nevertheless, the Hall soon voted to formally exclude banned people from induction, a position that was endorsed by Giamatti's successor Fay Vincent. On the other hand, in his most recent statement affirming Rose's ban, Commissioner Manfred stated \\"It is not a part of my authority... to make any determination concerning Mr. Rose's eligibility as a candidate for election to the (Hall of Fame)... in my view, the considerations that should drive a decision on whether an individual should be allowed to work in Baseball are not the same as those that should drive a decision on Hall of Fame eligibility... any debate over Mr. Rose's eligibility for the Hall of Fame is one that must take place in a different forum.\\" Notwithstanding Manfred's statements, the Hall of Fame's policies remain unchanged.)Statement by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred on Pete Rose How a ban imposed on an existing member of the Hall of Fame would affect that member in light of official Hall policy is not clear. Prior to Rose's ban, two members of the Hall of Fame (Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle) were banned from baseball for associating with licensed casinos (with duties unrelated to sports betting). The Hall took no action as a result of these bans, which in any event were extremely controversial while they were in effect and rescinded long before the Hall policy was formalized. Since that time, no active member of the Hall of Fame has been banned from Major League Baseball. Terms such as \\"lifetime ban\\" and \\"permanent ban\\" are misnomers, as a banned person may be reinstated (i.e., have the ban removed) whether by the decision of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball or (in the case of players banned since the establishment of the Major League Baseball Players Association) following an appeal by the MLBPA on behalf of a banned player to an independent arbitrator empowered to hear and adjudicate such appeals. Furthermore, in the case of Hall of Fame induction, bans have typically extended beyond a person's lifetime. Among the activities that a banned person is not precluded from participating (as of 2016) in include: *Participating in baseball leagues that are not affiliated with MLB; **This was not the case for players banned by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Early on in Landis' tenure (which was before the advent of the modern Minor League farm system), the new Commissioner made it clear that anyone who knowingly played with or against any banned player would himself be banned from MLB for life. Although Landis lacked any formal jurisdiction outside the then-16 MLB clubs, his uncompromising stance compelled every other professional league to honor MLB bans, in effect, giving Commissioner Landis the de facto power to completely exclude personnel from the game. Nevertheless, some players banned by Landis are believed to have continued playing under assumed identities at the minor league or semi-professional level. *Working for employers that themselves have business relationships with MLB and/or with a Major League or Minor League Club, provided the relationship does not result in a direct association with any Major League or Minor League Club and/or put the banned person in a position to influence baseball operations (for example, working for a national broadcaster that owns rights to MLB games); **During Landis' tenure, it was universally known that MLB would have immediately severed any relationship with an entity that employed personnel banned by MLB, and (at least until very recently), most such organizations have been extremely reluctant to offer employment to banned people for fear of generating negative publicity and/or out of concern that such employment might endanger their relationship with MLB. (MLB policy was articulated by Commissioner Manfred when, in reference to Rose, he stated \\"Major League Rules... do not cover relationships with third parties who do business with Major League Baseball. Any future relationship Mr. Rose may contemplate with any such party is a matter between him and the party, unless it involves any association with a Major League Club...\\")Statement by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred on Pete Rose *Working for an MLB or MiLB ownership group in an arrangement that keeps the banned person outside the organizational structure and uninvolved in the baseball operations of the Major League or Minor League Club in question (for example, working as an in- studio analyst for a broadcaster that owns the Major League club it holds the broadcasting rights for would be permitted); *Entering any Major League or Minor League ballpark in the capacity of (and with only the privileges of) an ordinary spectator. However, MLB rules define the granting free entry to a game or any other event with paid admission as a \\"business relationship\\" that, subject to Commissioner-granted dispensations for special events as described above, would not be permitted. This means, among other things, that a banned person must normally purchase a ticket (or have one given to him by a party not affiliated with MLB) in order to attend a game. List of banned people :Bans that are in effect and/or that were still in effect at the time of the banned person's death are denoted in bold. Living persons are denoted in italics. No banned person has ever been posthumously re-instated by Major League Baseball. = Pre-1920 = * Thomas Devyr, Ed Duffy and William Wansley of the New York Mutuals were banned in 1865 for associating with known gamblers. (Devyr was reinstated later that year, and Duffy and Wansley were reinstated in 1870.)The New York Mutuals were a member of the National Association of Base Ball Players (which is not to be confused with the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players) at the time; the NABBP was not a major league. * John Radcliff of the Chicago White Stockings was banned in 1874 after attempting to bribe umpire Billy McLean with $175 to help the White Stockings win. He was blacklisted but ultimately was reinstated and played the next year. *George Bechtel of the Louisville Grays was banned in 1876 for conspiring with his teammates to intentionally lose a game for $500, equal to $ today. *Jim Devlin, George Hall, Al Nichols and Bill Craver of the Louisville Grays were banned in 1877 for conspiring to throw two games in the Louisville Grays scandal. (No evidence was ever found to suggest that Craver actually had anything to do with the conspiracy, but he refused to cooperate with the investigators.) * Oscar Walker was banned in 1877 for \\"contract jumping\\" by signing a contract to play for another team while still under contract to the team he left. (This was 98 years prior to the advent of free agency in sports; Walker was reinstated in 1879.) Jack O'Connor * Lip Pike's play for Worcester in 1881 was so poor as to arouse suspicions, and Pike found himself the first professional player banned from the National League that September. He was added to the National League blacklist in 1881 (reinstated in 1883). * Umpire Richard Higham was banned in 1882 for conspiring to help throw a Detroit Wolverines game after Detroit's owner hired a private investigator to check out Higham's background and found that he was an associate of a known gambler. (To date, Higham is the only umpire banned for life.) * Joseph Marie Creamer III, New York Giants team physician, was banned in 1908 for attempting to bribe umpire Bill Klem $2,500 (equal to $ today) to conspire against the Chicago Cubs during a playoff game against the Giants. *Jack O'Connor and Harry Howell, manager and coach of the St. Louis Browns, were banned in 1910 for attempting to fix the outcome of the 1910 American League batting title for Cleveland Indians player Nap Lajoie against Ty Cobb. *Horace Fogel, Philadelphia Phillies owner, was banned in 1912 for publicly asserting that the umpires favored the New York Giants and were making unfair calls against his team. = Unofficial-turned-official bans = These players were unofficially banned from baseball prior to the creation of the office of Commissioner of Baseball and later had their bans made official by baseball's first Commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. *Hal Chase of the New York Giants was banned in 1921 for consorting with gamblers and betting on his own teams, among other disallowed practices. Chase had previously been accused of fixing games as early as 1910, and was reportedly passed over for managerial opportunities due to the allegations. In 1918, Reds manager Christy Mathewson had suspended Chase mid-season for fixing games, and John McGraw persuaded Mathewson to trade him to the Giants. At the end of the 1919 season, National League president John Heydler found evidence that Chase had indeed bribed players on other teams. Heydler forced his immediate release, and no other National League team would sign him. Since no American League team would sign him either, Chase was effectively blackballed from the major leagues. Landis' declaration after the Black Sox trial that no one who bet on baseball would ever be allowed to play is recognized as formalizing the ban. *Joe Harris of the Cleveland Indians was banned for life in 1920 after he chose to play for an independent team rather than the Indians. (Harris was reinstated by Landis in 1922 due to, in part, his service during World War I.) Heinie Zimmerman *Heinie Zimmerman of the New York Giants was banned in 1921 for encouraging his teammates to fix games. He had been benched by McGraw and later sent home during the 1919 season, and had been informally banned from the majors. During the 1917 World Series, he chased the winning run across the plate and found himself having to deny having helped throw the Series. Despite some of these allegations, McGraw would not turn him in, not wanting to be the one responsible for having one of his players banned for life, and suspended him indefinitely. Later, McGraw testified in court that Zimmerman conspired to fix games. As with Chase, Landis' declaration after the Black Sox trial is seen as formalizing Zimmerman's ban as well. = Banned under Commissioner Landis = Landis banned a total of nineteen people during his tenure, more than all of his successors combined. Of the nineteen, two were re-instated by Landis, one was re-instated by a successor and sixteen remain banned. As a condition of accepting the Commissioner's post, Landis demanded and got nearly unlimited power to sanction every person employed in the major leagues, from owners to batboys. In practice, Landis only meted out punishment for serious off-field transgressions he believed were a threat to the image and/or integrity of the game. Disciplinary action for the on-field behavior of players, coaches and managers remained the responsibility of the respective league presidents, as it had been prior to the creation of the Commissioner's office. Lefty Williams Chick Gandil * Eight players from the Chicago White Sox were banned in 1920 for conspiring with gamblers to throw the 1919 World Series in the Black Sox scandal: **Eddie Cicotte. (One story says that Cicotte had been promised a $10,000 bonus ‚Äì equal to $ today ‚Äì if he won 30 games; he was denied five starts towards the end of the season by team owner Charles Comiskey, who had manager Kid Gleason bench him to \\"save his arm for the World Series\\". However, the story remains unsubstantiated. Cicotte went 29‚Äì7 for the season.) **Lefty Williams lost all three of his starts in the World Series, setting a record that has never been matched. (The only other pitcher to have lost three games in a single World Series, George Frazier in , lost all three of his appearances in relief.) **Chick Gandil was the mastermind and ringleader of the scandal. In a 1956 article in Sports Illustrated, he admitted his role in the fix and expressed remorse for having done so, saying that he and his co- conspirators deserved to be thrown out of baseball just for talking to the gamblers.Gandil, Arnold (Chick). This is My Story of the Black Sox Series. Sports Illustrated, 1956-09-17. **Fred McMullin was only a backup infielder. However, he overheard teammates discussing the fix and threatened to report them unless he was included. **Swede Risberg was one of the ringleaders of the scandal. **Happy Felsch hit and fielded poorly in the series. **\\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson. (The precise extent of Jackson's involvement is controversial.) **Buck Weaver, like Jackson, was controversially banned. Weaver refused to accept any money and played to the best of his ability in the Series, but was banned nevertheless because he knew of the conspiracy but did not report it to MLB authorities and team ownership. (Weaver successfully sued White Sox owner Charles Comiskey for his 1921 salary.) *Joe Gedeon of the St. Louis Browns was banned in 1920 for allegedly conspiring with the gamblers behind the Black Sox scandal. *Eugene Paulette of the Philadelphia Phillies was banned in 1921 for associating with known gamblers. *Benny Kauff of the New York Giants was banned in 1920 for selling stolen cars. (Commissioner Landis considered him \\"no longer a fit companion for other ball players\\", despite Kauff being acquitted of the charges against him in court.) *Lee Magee of the Chicago Cubs was released just before the season began. Magee sued the Cubs for his 1920 salary and lost; after court testimony proved he had been involved in throwing games and collecting on bets, Landis banned him for life. * Heinie Groh of the Cincinnati Reds was banned for two days in 1921 while he held out for a higher salary, and Landis gave Groh an ultimatum: play for the Reds in 1921, or face lifetime banishment. (Groh chose the former option and played out the 1921 season; he retired in 1927.) * Ray Fisher of the Cincinnati Reds was banned in 1921 after he left his contract with the Reds to accept a coaching position at the University of Michigan before the start of the MLB season. Fisher believed his status would be voluntarily retired, but he later learned he had been declared ineligible. When Fisher appealed to Commissioner Landis, Landis banned him for violation of his contract. Fisher was reinstated by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in 1980; he died in 1982. * Dickie Kerr of the Chicago White Sox was suspended from organized baseball in 1922 for violating the reserve clause in his contract.Dickie Kerr Will Be Back With Sox Kerr was reinstated in 1925. *Phil Douglas of the New York Giants was banned in 1922 after notifying an acquaintance on the St. Louis Cardinals that he planned to jump the Giants for the pennant stretch run to spite McGraw, with whom Douglas had had a severe falling out during the regular season. *Jimmy O'Connell of the New York Giants and Giants coach Cozy Dolan were banned in 1924 for offering Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 (equal to $ today) to throw a game between the two teams for the financial gain of O'Connell own and his gambler backers. *William D. Cox, Philadelphia Phillies owner, was banned in 1943 for betting on his team's games. (Cox and one of the predecessor Phillies owners, Horace Fogel, are the only owners to be banned for life.) = Banned under Commissioner Kuhn = After Landis died in 1944, there was a long lull before the next banishment. During the tenures of Commissioners Happy Chandler (1945‚Äì1951), Ford Frick (1951‚Äì1965), Spike Eckert (1965‚Äì1968), Bowie Kuhn (1969‚Äì1984) and Peter Ueberroth (1984‚Äì1989), only three players (or former players) were banned for life. All three were banned by Kuhn, and all three were later reinstated. By the time of Kuhn's tenure, players had organized the Major League Baseball Players Association and negotiated the first Basic Agreement with the owners. Among other things the Agreement provided, for the first time, an independent process through which active players could appeal disciplinary decisions (up to and including lifetime bans) by League presidents or the Commissioner. As of 2016, no such process exists for personnel who are not members of the MLBPA. * Ferguson Jenkins of the Texas Rangers was banned in 1980 after a customs search in Toronto, Ontario, found of cocaine, of hashish, and of marijuana on his person. (Jenkins missed the rest of the 1980 season, but was reinstated by an independent arbiter, and retired following the 1983 season. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991.) * Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, both retired and both in no way involved in baseball anymore, were banned in 1980 and 1983 respectively after they were hired by casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as greeters and autograph signers.Spokane Spokesman-Review, October 20, 1983, \\"Kuhn called off-base for Mantle, Mays bans\\". (Kuhn opined that a casino was \\"no place for a baseball hero and Hall of Famer.\\" The bans took place prior to the Hall formalizing its policy against inducting banned persons, and the Hall took no action as a result of Kuhn's decision. Mantle and Mays were reinstated by Peter Ueberroth in 1985, and Mantle died in 1995.) = Banned under Commissioner Giamatti = A. Bartlett Giamatti served only five months as Commissioner of Baseball before he died of a heart attack at his Martha's Vineyard home on September 1, 1989. *Pete Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds and MLB's all-time leader in base hits, was investigated by lawyer John M. Dowd in 1989 for his alleged ties to gamblers and illegal bookmakers; when new information on Rose's gambling habits (including, among other things, betting on but not against the Reds) came to light, Giamatti and Rose reached a legal settlement that resulted in Rose's placement on the ineligible list on August 24, 1989. **Whereas all other banned MLB personnel were involuntarily rendered ineligible pursuant to a unilateral decision by the Commissioner, Rose is the only person to be placed on the MLB ineligible list as a result of a mutual agreement. As part of their agreement, Rose accepted that there was a factual reason for his banishment. In return, Giamatti agreed that MLB would not make a formal finding of guilt or innocence with respect to the allegations against Rose. In addition, Rose is permitted to apply for reinstatement once a year indefinitely. Notwithstanding their agreement, the Commissioner stated in his press conference that \\"I have concluded that (Rose) bet on baseball\\" and described his sanction as \\"banishment for life\\" and \\"lifetime ineligibility,\\" although he also made clear he was open to the possibility of re-instatement provided Rose could provide evidence of a \\"redirected, reconfigured, rehabilitated life.\\" Giamatti died eight days later ‚Äì his sudden demise immediately following Rose's banishment has been seen by some people including Rose himself as an impediment to re-instatement. After years of denial, Rose admitted to betting on baseball (and on the Reds) in early 2004. He later acknowledged that \\"everything\\" the Dowd Report contained was the complete, unadulterated truth.Associated Press, March 16, 2007 \\"Rose admits to betting on Reds 'every night'\\". Since admitting to his gambling infractions, Rose has maintained that he never bet against the Reds, never avoided betting on a particular starting pitcher and never bet on baseball until after he retired as a player ‚Äì assertions that Dowd has disputed. No credible evidence has emerged to suggest Rose bet against his own team or systematically avoided betting on any pitcher(s) in his starting rotations; however, some evidence has come to light suggesting Rose started betting on baseball while still a player-manager in Cincinnati. Rose has applied for reinstatement four times, all of which have been either ignored or denied, in large part due to Rose's acknowledgement that he continues to (legally) bet on baseball. = Banned under Commissioner Vincent = Fay Vincent became commissioner upon the death of Giamatti. * George Steinbrenner, New York Yankees owner, was banned in 1990 for bribing a private investigator $40,000 () to \\"dig up dirt\\" on Yankees player Dave Winfield in order to discredit him; much of the information Steinbrenner received was from small-time gambler and rackets-runner Howard Spira, who had once worked for Winfield's charitable foundation. (In Steinbrenner's absence, Robert Nederlander, a limited partner, took control of the Yankees, and Joe Molloy, Steinbrenner's son-in-law, took control after Nederlander resigned. Molloy relinquished the team back to Steinbrenner when Bud Selig reinstated him in 1993; Steinbrenner retired as owner in 2006, passing control to his sons permanently, and died in 2010.) * Steve Howe of the New York Yankees was banned in 1992 after receiving seven suspensions related to drug use, particularly cocaine and alcohol. (An independent arbiter reinstated Howe shortly after; Howe retired in 1996 and died in 2006.) = Banned under Commissioner Selig = Bud Selig became Commissioner after Fay Vincent's resignation; he was Acting Commissioner between 1992‚Äì1998, and was elected to the Office of Commissioner in 1998. In 1999, Selig oversaw the disbandment of the American and National League offices and took over all but a few ceremonial duties formerly performed by the League Presidents, including the discipline of personnel for on-field behavior. * Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was banned in 1996 for bringing Major League Baseball into disrepute by repeatedly making slurs against African-Americans, Jews, Asians and homosexuals. (Schott had previously been fined $250,000, , and banned from day-to-day operations of the Reds for the 1993 season for similar offending. She was the first, and to date only, woman to be banned; she was reinstated in 1998, sold a majority stake in her franchise in 1999 and died in 2004.) = Banned under Commissioner Manfred = Rob Manfred succeeded Bud Selig as the Commissioner of Baseball after Selig's retirement on January 25, 2015. *Jenrry Mej√≠a, New York Mets pitcher, was banned on February 12, 2016, for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs three times in less than a year. He sought and was granted reinstatement in July 2018, and was allowed to join the Dominican Summer League Mets in August. Subject to conditions set by Manfred, all restrictions were lifted at the beginning of spring training in 2019, by which point Mej√≠a had been released by the Mets and signed to a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. *Chris Correa, former St. Louis Cardinals scouting director, was permanently banned on January 30, 2017, for his role in hacking the Houston Astros' scouting database to provide the Cardinals with a competitive edge in scouting. The Cardinals were also ordered to pay the Astros $2 million in restitution, and forfeited their top two picks in the 2017 draft to the Astros. Correa was later sentenced to 46 months in prison for unauthorized access of a protected computer.\\"Ex-Cards scouting director Chris Correa sentenced to prison for hacking Astros\\", ESPN (July 19, 2016). \\"After investigation, MLB orders Cardinals to forfeit top two picks, pay $2 million to Astros\\", ESPN (January 30, 2017). *John Coppolella, former Atlanta Braves general manager, was permanently banned on November 21, 2017, for his role in the Braves' circumvention of MLB rules regarding the signing of international free agents. The Braves were also required to release 12 prospects signed as international free agents, most notably Kevin Mait√°n, and MLB voided the contract of Ji-hwan Bae. *Brandon Taubman, former Houston Astros assistant general manager, was added to the list on January 13, 2020, for inappropriate comments toward female reporters in the Astros clubhouse in October 2019. Taubman is not eligible to apply for reinstatement until after the 2020 World Series, and will be permanently banned if he commits another \\"material violation\\" of baseball rules.

It has been the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands since 1963 although Dries van Agt was the last premier to live in the building. Current Prime Minister Mark Rutte lives in a flat in the centre of The Hague, closer to his office, the Torentje in the Binnenhof. The residence is currently used to house political meetings and receive official guests. History As Huis Sorgvliet it was built on the site of a former farm, probably part of the living quarters were incorporated in the left wing, by Jacob Cats (1577‚Äì1660), a prominent poet and politician who lived there since 14 July 1652. Originally it had only one storey. In 1675 estate Sorgvliet came into the possession of Hans Willem Bentinck, chamberlain of the future King-Stadholder William III (1650‚Äì1702).

Isabelle Adjani won a C√©sar award for her performance in this film. The film was a massive hit in France gaining 5,137,040 admissions and was the 2nd highest-grossing film of the year. Plot In this tragic tale of misunderstanding, obsession, and increasing madness, Eliane (\\"Elle\\"), a beautiful young woman (Isabelle Adjani) settles into a small town in the south of France with her introverted mother (Maria Machado) and physically handicapped father, and soon becomes the subject of wild speculation because of her aloofness and at the same time, her obvious sexuality. The young woman is actually caught up in the desire to avenge the long-ago rape of her mother by three men who had arrived at her isolated house in a van which contained an old piano which they were delivering. A shy car mechanic (Alain Souchon) becomes enamored of her, and the woman suddenly sees him in a different light when she learns that his father, now dead, was an Italian immigrant who had owned and tried unsuccessfully to pawn the piano. Intent on taking action against the mechanic's family to right the wrong suffered by her mother, the daughter begins to lose her grip on sanity when she finds out that the men she suspects of the rape are actually innocent. In fact, her father had long ago exacted his own vengeance on the real culprits. This knowledge pushes her over the edge, and she has to be institutionalized. Meanwhile, the young mechanic misunderstands what happened and that leads to tragedy; he tracks down and kills the innocent men Elle had suspected of raping her mother, believing them to be responsible for Elle's current condition. Cast * Isabelle Adjani as Eliane Wieck, known as \\"Elle\\"; she is known by her German mother's maiden name rather than by the surname of her de facto father (Gabriel Devigne), because she is the product of rape.

It is an urban township; the 2010 census found 28,328 people in the township. Geography Located in the western part of the county, it borders the following townships: * Jackson Township - north * Plain Township - northeast corner * Canton Township - east * Pike Township - southeast corner * Bethlehem Township - south * Sugar Creek Township - southwest corner * Tuscarawas Township - west * Lawrence Township - northwest corner Several populated places are located in Perry Township: * Most of the city of Massillon is located in the western half of Perry Township * A small part of the village of Navarre, in the southwest * The census-designated place of Perry Heights, in the northeast * The unincorporated community of Richville, in the south Name and history On December 7, 1813, Stark County Commissioners named Township 10, Range 9, Perry Township. It was named in honor of Oliver Hazard Perry, hero of the War of 1812. Commander Perry was the victor of a battle on Lake Erie on September 10, 1812. The first formal settlement in the township was Kendal, founded in 1812 by Thomas Rotch and his wife who were Quakers from Massachusetts. Other settlers arriving with the Rotch Family were Arvine Wales and Charles Skinner. They utilized Sippo Creek and operated a woolen factory and saw mill. In 1826, James Duncan founded Massillon. The Ohio/Erie Canal was opened to Massillon in 1828 and the entire area and surrounding communities grew exponentially. Johnny Appleseed (Jonathan Chapman) planted the first orchard in Perry Township on the south side of the Canton‚ÄìMassillon Road on the Daum Farm. Dr. William Gardner was believed to have been the first physician to settle in Perry Township. He came from New York in 1814. The first religious society was the Religious Society of Friends in Kendal about 1813. Methodists soon populated the area. In 1833, Perry Township contained three gristmills, seven saw mills, one fulling mill, two tanneries, and sixteen stores. The first school in the township was established in Kendal. Public schools or common schools came into existence in Perry Township in 1825. By 1875, Perry Township had seven one-room schools. The construction of Reedurban, Genoa, and Richville Schools brought the one- room era to an end. In the 1950s, Whipple, Watson, Lohr, and Perry High were built. The 1956 opening of Perry High School signifies the first time Perry Local Schools offered secondary education. The growth of the school system continued with the construction of Edison Junior High in 1962 and a vocational wing on the High School in 1964. Perry Township as a community experienced rapid growth. The agricultural farms from the early days have been reborn as housing developments, commercial and industrial sites, medical facilities, and municipal structures. In the 1970s, housing developments in the township were advertised as \\"the convenience of the city and the charm of the country\\". Affinity Medical Center (Formerly named, and locally referred to as Doctors' Hospital) was built, constructed, and opened in 1963. The hospital contains 272,000 square feet and is built upon 9.27 acres of land, which is situated on Austin Avenue, south of Watson Elementary (whose playground contained a helicopter pad that served for emergency flights to the hospital). It served as Massillon's first emergency medical center and hospital besides nearby Mercy Medical Center, and in the mid 80's, Aultman Hospital, both located in nearby Canton. It operated for more than 40 years until closing its doors in 2008 due to rapidly lowering business and structural decay. The property was later sold in 2010, merely for $1 due to the staggering costs of maintenance and taxes, which was estimated to be about $1,000,000. The parent company, Community Health Systems of Nashville, Tennessee, originally planned to have the building demolished, but decided against it due to the demolition fees which amounted around $700,000. The land is currently for sale again at an undisclosed price. The hospital has been victim to recent vandalism and neglect and was demolished in March 2020. The building is also locally rumored to be haunted, so much so that the Ohio Exploration Society made a documented visit to the building in 2010. The hospital contained the Stark County Morgue until it was shut down. The morgue was speculated to be heavily understaffed and overflowing with bodies at peak times, which fed the accusations of being haunted. Today, Perry Township is a stable, united community with a population of nearly 30,000 residents. Even though most of the land has been developed, there is still a hint of the agricultural history in some sections of the township. It is one of twenty-six Perry Townships statewide. Perry Township celebrated its bicentennial in 2014. Government The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd- numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer,¬ß503.24, ¬ß505.01, and ¬ß507.01 of the Ohio Revised Code. Accessed April 30, 2009. who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

Having heard of idolatry in Bavaria, Emmeram travelled to Ratisbon (Regensburg) some time after the year 649 to the court of Theodo I, Duke of Bavaria. He supposedly travelled up the Loire, crossed through the Black Forest and then followed the Danube to Regensburg. Theodo welcomed Emmeram to his court, where he laboured for three years carrying out missionary work. During this time, he gained a reputation as a pious man. He died circa 652 and is buried in St. Emmeram's in Regensburg, Germany. His feast day in the Catholic Calendar of saints is September 22. Life Arbeo of Freising wrote a biography of Emmeram in 750, the Vita Sancti Emmerami, about 100 years after the saint's death. The literature tells the story of Emmeram, born to a noble family in Aquitaine. According to some people, he became Bishop of Poitiers,Clugnet, L√©on. \\"St. Emmeram.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 14 April 2019 even if his name does not appear on the rolls. There is speculation that he held the office briefly between the death of Dido and the accession of Ansoaldus. Having heard of idolatry in Bavaria, he decided to travel to Ratisbon (Regensburg) some time after the year 649 to the court of Agilofing, Theodo I, Duke of Bavaria. He supposedly travelled up the Loire, crossed through the Black Forest and then followed the Danube to Regensburg. Theodo welcomed Emmeram to his court, where he laboured for three years carrying out missionary work. During this time, he gained a reputation as a pious man. As the story goes, Uta (or Ota), the daughter of the duke, confided to Emmeram that she was expecting a child out of wedlock. According to Arbeo, the father was one Sigipaldus from her father's own court. Moved with compassion, Emmeram advised her to name himself, whom everyone respected, as the father hoping to mitigate some of her shame. Shortly thereafter, the legend goes, Emmeram abruptly went on a pilgrimage to Rome. At this point, Uta named Emmeram as the father. When Duke Theodo and his son Lantpert learned of Uta's pregnancy, Lantpert went after the bishop. Lantpert caught up with Emmeram in Helfendorf (now part of the Munich suburb of Aying) on the old Roman road between Salzburg and Augsburg on the Via Julia Augusta and greeted him as \\"bishop and brother-in-law\\". According to popular tradition, wanting to protect the real culprit, Emmeram did not defend himself, and received numerous wounds. Lantpert and his followers tied Emmeram to a ladder and proceeded to torture and cut him into pieces. His companions, Vitalis and Wolflete, found him still alive, lying in his own blood, and tried to bring him quickly back to Aschheim, where a walled church of Apostle Peter stood. The day of his martyrdom is also his name day, 22 September. Veneration The legend of Emmeram's torture describes how he was bound to a ladder, and was hacked to pieces. Later his eyes were taken out and his nose was cut off. Still living, he asked for water. His companion Vitalis answered, \\"Why do you seek relief, when nothing of you remains but your stubby trunk, undecorated with limbs? I would think you should wish for your death rather than live with such shame.\\" Emmeram answered that one should not attempt to hurry death, rather drag it out, in order to persuade the face of God's mercy through divine intervention. At this Emmeram was beheaded. As proof of Emmeram's innocence, a ladder was lowered to bear him to Heaven. As they carried his body to Aschheim a wondrous light shone from his body. The Martyrdom of Saint Emmeram (Salzburg), from the Cathedral Treasury and Diocese Museum, Eichst√§tt A text printed in Munich in 1743, Officium oder Tageszeiten des wunderth√§tigen Bayerischen Apostels und Blutzeugen Christi St. Emmerami, zu t√§glichen und and√§chtigen Gebrauch in allen Anliegen und Widerw√§rtigkeiten etc., states that the cart was accompanied by Arbeo of Freising depicted the place of his death as a \\"lovely, ever spring-green place, upon which a spring appeared and the local people later built a little church.\\" When the misunderstanding of Emmeram's relationship to Uta was revealed, he was entombed in Aschheim, whereupon legend states that it rained for forty days. Emmeram was exhumed and put upon a raft in the Isar. When the raft reached the Danube, it miraculously floated upstream to Regensburg, where Emmeram was interred in the church of St. George.(A somewhat similar tale is told of Lubentius of Dietkirchen.)Delehaye S.J., Hippolyte. \\"The Development of the Legend\\", The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography, (V. M. Crawford, trans.), 1907 His remains were later moved to a church dedicated to the martyr. This church burned down in 1642. Emmeram's bones were found under the altar in 1645 and moved to St. Emmeram's Abbey. The church, now a basilica minor, houses his leg bones in a silver reliquary in the eastern portion under the altar. At the spot Saint Emmeram died in the year 652, a small chapel was erected in the year 1842. The church of St. Lorenz in Oberf√∂hring has a side altar dedicated to St. Emmeram. In the church of Saints Peter and Paul in Aschheim, a plaque memorializes the first grave of Emmeram with an inscription.

As is the case with many other contemporary Mesoamerican religions, it results from centuries of symbiosis with Roman Catholicism. When its pre-Spanish antecedents are taken into account, however, traditional Maya religion has already existed for more than two millennia as a recognizably distinct phenomenon. Before the advent of Christianity, it was spread over many indigenous kingdoms, all after their own local traditions. Today, it coexists and interacts with pan-Mayan syncretism, the 're-invention of tradition' by the Pan-Maya movement, and Christianity in its various denominations. Sources of traditional Mayan religion The most important source on traditional Maya religion is the Mayas themselves: the incumbents of positions within the religious hierarchy, diviners, and tellers of tales, and more generally all those persons who shared their knowledge with outsiders. (such as anthropologists) in the past and continue to do this until today. What is known of pre-Spanish Maya religion stems from heterogeneous sources (the primary ones being of Maya origin): *Primary sources from pre- Spanish times: the three surviving Maya hieroglyphic books (the Maya codices of Dresden, Madrid and Paris) plus the Maya-Toltec Grolier Codex, all dating from the Postclassic period (after 900 AD); the 'ceramic codex' (the corpus of pottery scenes and texts) and mural paintings; the petrographical texts from the Classic (200‚Äì900 AD) and Late-Preclassic (200 BC-200 AD) periods *Primary sources from the early-colonial (16th-century) period, such as the Popol Vuh, the Ritual of the Bacabs, and (at least in part) the various Chilam Balam books *Secondary sources, chiefly Spanish treatises from the colonial period, such as those of Landa for the Lowland Mayas and Las Casas for the Highland Mayas, but also lexicons such as the early-colonial Motul (Yucatec) and Coto (Kaqchikel) dictionaries *Archaeological, epigraphic, and iconographic studies *Anthropological reports published since the late 19th century, used in combination with the sources above Fundamentals of ritual Traditional Maya religion, though also representing a belief system, is often referred to as costumbre, the 'custom' or habitual religious practice, in contradistinction to orthodox Roman Catholic ritual. To a large extent, Maya religion is indeed a complex of ritual practices; and it is, therefore, fitting that the indigenous Yucatec village priest is simply called jmen (\\"practitioner\\"). Among the main concepts relating to Maya ritual are the following ones. =Ritual topography and calendrical mapping= The Mayan landscape is a ritual topography, with landmarks such as mountains, wells and caves being assigned to specific ancestors and deities (see also Maya cave sites). Thus, the Tzotzil town of Zinacantan is surrounded by seven 'bathing places' of mountain-dwelling ancestors, with one of these sacred waterholes serving as the residence of the ancestors' 'nursemaids and laundresses'.Vogt 1976: 63 Part of these ritual takes place in or near such landmarks, in Yucat√°n, they also take place around karstic sinkholes (cenotes). Ritual was governed not only by the geographical lay-out of shrines and temples, but also by the projection of calendrical models onto the landscape. In contemporary Quichean Momostenango, for example, specific combinations of day-names and numbers are ascribed to specialized shrines in the mountains, signalling the appropriate times for their ritual use.Tedlock 1992: 76‚Äì85 In the northwestern Maya highlands, the four days, or 'Day Lords', that can start a year are assigned to four mountains. In early-colonial Yucat√°n, the thirteen Katun periods and their deities, mapped onto a landscape conceived as a 'wheel', are said to be successively 'established' in specific towns.Roys 1967: 132‚Äì134 =Offerings and sacrifices= Offerings serve to establish and renew relations ('contracts', 'pacts', or 'covenants') with the other world, and the choice, number, preparation, and arrangement of the offered items (such as special maize breads,Love 1989: 336‚Äì350 maize and cacao drinks and honey liquor, flowers, incense nodules, rubber figures, and also, cigarsThompson 1970:112‚Äì113) obey to stringent rules. In the same way, a drink made of exactly 415 grains of parched maize was to be offered to participants in a pre-Spanish New Year ritual, and on another occasion, the precise number of 49 grains of maize mixed with copal (incense) was to be burnt.Tozzer 1941:141 A well-known example of a ritual meal is the \\"Holy Mass of the maize farmer\\" (misa milpera) celebrated for the Yucatec rain deities. Particularly Lacandon ritual was entirely focused on the 'feeding' of the deities, as represented by their incense burners.Tozzer 1907: 84‚Äì93, 102‚Äì105, 105‚Äì150 In the ancient Maya cities, all sorts of offertory items (including sacrificial implements) were also stored and buried in deposits (caches) below architectural features such as floors, stelas, and altars; in these cases, the intention may often have been a dedication to a specific religious purpose, rather than an offering to a divine recipient. The forms sacrifice might take vary considerably. In contemporary sacrificial rites, there is an overall emphasis on the sprinkling of blood, especially that of turkeys. In the pre-Spanish past, sacrifice usually consisted of animals such as deer, dog, quail, turkey, and fish, but on exceptional occasions (such as accession to the throne, severe illness of the ruler, royal burial, or drought and famine) also came to include human beings, adults as well as children.Accession: see Piedras Negras stela 11; illness and burial: Las Casas, in Miles 1957: 750, 773; drought: Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 54, 180‚Äì181 The sacrificed child may have served as a 'substitute', a concept known from curing ritual.Taube 1994: 669‚Äì671 Partaking of the sacrifice was common, but ritual cannibalism appears to have been exceedingly rare. A characteristic feature of ancient Mayan ritual (though not exclusive to the Mayas) were the \\"bloodletting\\" sessions held by high officials and members of the royal families, during which the earlobes, tongues, and foreskins were cut with razor-sharp small knives and stingray spines;Joralemon 1974: 59‚Äì75 the blood fell on paper strips that were possibly burnt afterwards. =Priesthood= The traditional Maya have their own religious functionaries, often hierarchically organized, and charged with the duties of praying and sacrificing on behalf of lineages, local groups, or the entire community. In many places, they operate within the Catholic brotherhoods (or 'cofrad√≠as') and the so-called civil-religious hierarchy (or 'cargo system'), organizations which have played a crucial role in the preservation of pre-Spanish religious traditions. The two most important male deities (Mart√≠n and Maxim√≥n) of the Tz'utujil Mayas of Santiago Atitl√°n, for example, have their own brotherhoods and priests.Christenson 2001: 157, 178 Public ritual focusing on agriculture and rain is led by the 'godfathers of the wet season' (padrinos del invierno) among the Ch'orti'sGirard 1949: 783‚Äì813 ‚Äì in a particularly rich and complex system ‚Äì and by the village priests (jmenob) in Yucat√°n. In the private realm, nearly everywhere diviners ('seers', 'daykeepers') are active, together with curers. The performance of many of the indigenous priests, but especially of the curers, shows features also associated with shamanism.Tedlock 1992:46‚Äì53 Contemporary Maya priest in a healing ritual at Tikal Knowledge of the earlier Maya priesthood is almost entirely based on what their Spanish missionary colleagues have to say about them (Landa for Yucat√°n, Las Casas and others for the Guatemalan Highlands). The upper echelon of the priesthood was a repository of learning, also in the field of history and genealogical knowledge. Around 1500, the Yucatec priesthood was hierarchically organized, from the high priest living at the court down to the priests in the towns, and the priestly books were distributed along these lines.Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 27 The role model for the high priest is likely to have been the upper god Itzamna, first priest and inventor of the art of writing.Tozzer 1941: 146n707 The most general word for priest, including the Yucatec high priest, appears to have been ah k'in 'calendrical priest'. Some priests were ordinary diviners, while others had specialized knowledge of the katun cycle.Tozzer 1941: 26n136, quoting Avenda√±o Aside from calendrical learning, however, priests had multiple tasks, running from performing life crisis rituals to managing the monthly feast cycle, and held special offices, such as that of oracle (chilan), astrologer, and sacrificer of human beings (nacom). In the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj, the most important deities (Tohil, Awilix, Jacawitz and Gukumatz) had their own high priests.Orellana 1981: 163. At all levels, access to the late-Postclassic priesthood seems to have been restricted to the nobility. Little is known with certainty concerning the Classic Maya priesthood. Iconographically, there can be no serious doubt but that the aged, ascetic figures depicted as writing and reading books, aspersing and inaugurating dignitaries and kings, and overseeing human sacrifice, represent professional priests and high priests at court. Certain hieroglyphic titles of noblemen have been interpreted as priestly ones (e.g., ajk'uhuun, possibly 'worshipper', yajaw k'ahk 'master of fire').Stuart 2005: 31‚Äì32, 123, 176; Zender 2004 The king (k'uhul ajaw or 'holy lord'), too, acted ex officio as a priest. =Purification= Purificatory measures such as fasting, sexual abstention, bathing, and (especially in the pre-Spanish past) confession generally precede major ritual events. In 16th-century Yucat√°n, purification (exorcism of evil spirits) often represented a ritual's initial phase. The bloodletting-rituals (see below) may also have had a purificatory function. More generally, purification is needed before entering areas inhabited by deities. In present-day Yucat√°n, for example, it is customary to drink standing water from a rock depression at the first opportunity upon entering the forest. The water is then spat on the ground, and thus renders the individual 'virginal', free to carry out the business of humankind in the sacred forest. =Prayer= Maya prayer almost invariably accompanies acts of offering and sacrifice. It often takes the form of long litanies, in which the names of personified days, saints, angels (rain and lightning deities), features of the landscape connected with historical or mythical events, and mountains are particularly prominent.K√∂hler 1995 Its importance is highlighted by the fact that Maya communities in the northwestern highlands of Guatemala have a specialized group of 'Prayermakers'. Prayers, with their hypnotizing scansion, often show a dyadic couplet structure which has also been recognized in Classic period texts.Hull 2003 The earliest prayers recorded in European script are in Quich√©, and are embedded in the creation myths of the Popol Vuh. Pilgrimage Through pilgrimages, which create networks connecting places regionally as well as over larger distances, Maya religion transcends the limits of the local community. Nowadays, pilgrimages often involve reciprocal visits of the village saints (as represented by their statues), but also visits farther- removed sanctuaries, as exemplified by the Q'eqchi' pilgrimages to their thirteen sacred mountains.Adams and Brady 2005:301‚Äì327 Around 1500, Chichen Itza used to attract pilgrims from all the surrounding kingdoms to its large cenote; other pilgrims visited local shrines, such as those of Ix Chel and other goddesses on the islands off Yucat√°n's east coast. Eight centuries earlier, noblemen from sundry Classic kingdoms went on pilgrimage to the caves of Naj Tunich and had their visits recorded on the sanctuary's walls.Stone 2014 Dramatic performance and impersonation Feasts would include dramatic performances and the impersonation of deities, especially by the king. =Feasting and dramatic performance= In recent times, feasts are usually organized by religious brotherhoods, with the greatest expenses being for the higher charges. Similarly, in the pre-Spanish kingdom of Man√≠, some religious feasts seem to have been sponsored by wealthy and preeminent men,see Tozzer 1941:140, 164, 166 perhaps reflecting a general practice in Postclassic and earlier kingdoms. Through the feasts, capital could be redistributed in food and drink. The continual and obligatory drinking, negatively commented on by early as well as contemporary outsiders, establishes community, not only among the human participants, but also between these and the deities. Both in recent times and in the Classic Period, more complex rituals would include music and dance, processions, and theatrical play. Nowadays, the performance of important dances and dance dramas (not always religious ones) often takes place on the feast of the patron saint of the village and on certain set occasions dictated by the Catholic Calendar (such as Corpus Christi and the 'May Cross'). For the late Postclassic period, Landa mentions specific dances executed during either the New Year rituals (e.g., the Xibalba okot 'dance of Xibalba') or the monthly feasts (e.g., the holkan okot 'dance of the war chiefs'). The god most often shown dancing during the Classic period is the Tonsured Maize God, a patron of feasting. =Impersonation= The theatrical impersonation of deities and animals, a general Mesoamerican practice, also characterized pre-Hispanic Mayan performances and included the wayob (were- animals).Looper 2009:132‚Äì142 Ritual humor (a vehicle for social criticism) could be part of these events, involving such actors as opossums, spider monkeys, and the aged Bacabs, with women sometimes being cast in erotic roles.Taube 1989: 351‚Äì382 Often, impersonation meant ritual representation on a state level, particularly as depicted on stelae and ball game panels. On the royal stelae ‚Äì that is, at five-tun or k'atun celebrations ‚Äì the king wears the heads of important deities and forces of nature for a headdress or a mask, while carrying a sceptre in the form of the lightning deity. The heads are frequently those of the rain deity (Chaac) and of an aquatic serpent. On the other hand, the reigning queen, or queen consort, usually represents the principal maize goddess, that is, a female Tonsured Maize God. Young men, perhaps princes, can impersonate the four deities carrying the earth (Bacabs) while holding the four associated Year Bearer days in their handsStuart 2005 or carrying a throne; they may also substitute for the principal rain deity (Chaac). Hieroglyphic expressions of the concept of impersonation involve many other deities as well.Nehammer, Thun, Helmke In some cases, impersonation may relate to the individual's identity with, or transformation into, a phenomenon of nature. Ritual domains The only extensive treatment of pre-Spanish Maya ritual by a near-contemporary concerns Yucat√°n, particularly the kingdom of Mani, and was written by friar Diego de Landa (ca. 1566). However, major ritual domains, such as those of agriculture and kingship, are hardly touched upon by Landa. =Calendar= The Maya calendar, connected to networks of sacrificial shrines, is fundamental for ritual life. The rites of the 260-day cycle are treated below ('Sciences of Destiny'). Among the highland Maya, the calendrical rites of the community as a whole relate to the succession of the 365-day years, and to the so-called 'Year Bearers' in particular, that is, the four named days that can serve as new year days. Conceived as divine lords, these Year Bearers were welcomed on the mountain (one of four) which was to be their seat of power, and worshipped at each recurrence of their day in the course of the year.Tedlock 1992: 99‚Äì104 The calendrical rites include the five-day marginal period at the end of the year. In 16th-century Yucat√°n, a straw puppet called 'grandfather' (mam) was set up and venerated, only to be discarded at the end of the marginal period, or Uayeb (Cogolludo). In this same interval, the incoming patron deity of the year was installed and the outgoing one removed. Through annually shifting procession routes, the calendrical model of the four 'Year Bearers' (New Year days) was projected onto the four quarters of the town.Coe 1965 Landa's detailed treatment of the New Year rites ‚Äì the most important description of a pre-Hispanic Maya ritual complex to have come down to us ‚Äì corresponds on essential points to the schematic depiction of these rites in the much earlier Dresden Codex. Like the Year Bearers, the thirteen twenty-year periods (katuns) of the Short Count were viewed as divine lords in their own right and worshipped accordingly. The katuns had specific divine patrons (as mentioned in the Chilam Balam books) and their own priests.Avenda√±o, in Tozzer 1941: 29 note 156 =Occupational groups= The 18 months had festivals, dedicated to specific deities, which were largely celebrated by occupational groups (in particular hunters and fishermen, bee-keepers, cacao planters, curers, and warriors).Tozzer 1941: 153‚Äì166 It is not known if and to what extent this festival cycle of the kingdom of Man√≠ was shared by the other Yucatec kingdoms, and if it was also valid for the earlier Mayan kingdoms, both in Yucat√°n and elsewhere. J√©ets m√©ek' ritual as practiced nowadays in Yucatan =Life cycle= Life cycle rituals (or rites of passage) demarcate the various stages of life. Landa details one of these rituals, destined for making young boys and girls marriable (caput sihil 'second birth'). The Yucatec Maya continue the ritual (Hetz mek) which marks a child's movement from cradling or carrying to the mother's hip. It is performed at about three months and has godparents of the ceremony. The child is offered implements appropriate to its gender, tools for boys and cloth or thread for girls. If the children grasp them, this is considered a foretelling. All children are offered pencils and paper. =Health= Contemporary healing rituals focus on the retrieval and reincorporation of the lost souls or soul particles imprisoned somewhere by specific deities or ancestors.e.g., K√∂hler 1995 The procedures can include the sacrifice of fowl treated as the patient's 'substitute' (Tzotzil k'exolil- helolil).Vogt 1976: 91‚Äì94 The main collection of ancient Yucatec curing rituals is the so-called Ritual of the Bacabs. In these texts, the world with its four trees and four carriers of earth and sky (Bacabs) located at the corners is the theatre of shamanic curing sessions, during which \\"the four Bacabs\\" are often addressed to assist the curer in his struggle with disease- causing agents. Many of the features of shamanic curing found in the 'Ritual of the Bacabs' still characterize contemporary curing ritual. Not represented amongst these early ritual texts is black sorcery. =Weather and agriculture= Influencing the weather is the main purpose of the rain-making rituals ‚Äì sometimes of a secretive character ‚Äì that are found all over the Maya areae.g., Girard 1949: 819‚Äì832; Redfield 1934: 138‚Äì143; Vogt 1969: 386, 473; Christenson 2001: 98, 209, 164, 211 and also of such rituals as 'Imprisoning the winds' Girard 1995: 40‚Äì41 and 'Sealing the frost' LaFarge 1947: 125 just before the sowing season. The officiating priests of the rain- making rituals are sometimes believed to ascend into the clouds and there to act like rain deities themselves.e.g., Christenson 2001: 70, 209 Influencing the weather can also mean deflecting the rain clouds from neighbouring areas, and thus imply black sorcery. The principal focus of the agricultural rites is the sowing and harvesting of the maize. Particularly the rituals of the Yucatec and Ch'orti' MayasGirard 1995 have been described in great detail. For eastern Yucat√°n, a whole taxonomy of ritual sequences has been established,Gabriel 2000 including variable rituals for protecting an area against evil influences (loh), thanksgiving (uhanlikol 'dinner of the maize field'), and imploring the rain deities (ch'a ch√°ak). An important sanctuary for Terminal Classic rain and maize rituals was the large cave of Balankanche near Chich√©n Itz√°, with its numerous Tlaloc censers and miniature metates.Andrews et al. 1970 =Hunt= In one of the 16th-century Yucatec month feasts, hunters danced with arrows and deer skulls painted blue.Tozzer 1941: 155‚Äì156 The focus on animal skulls is significant, since even today, traditional Maya hunters have the duty to preserve the skulls and bones of their booty, deposit these periodically in hunting shrines, and thus restore them to their supernatural Owners for regeneration.Brown 2005 They should also respect certain hunting taboos, such as those on adultery and unnecessarily wounding the game, on penalty of supernatural sanction; for this same reason, in another month of the 16th-century Yucatec feast cycle, a rite of contrition was held by the hunters.Tozzer 1941: 162 =Territory= The claims on territory by social groups of varying dimensions were expressed in rituals such as those for the waterholes, ancestral lands,Vogt 1976: 97‚Äì115 and the boundaries of the entire community.LaFarge 1947: 126‚Äì127 The focus of these rituals were often crosses, or rather, 'cross shrines', and prayers were directed at rain and earth deities. For earlier periods, such crosses and shrines can, perhaps, be thought of as being connected to the central 'cross', or world tree of the centre,cf. Freidel, Schele, Parker 1993: 261 best exemplified by the arboreal crosses in the temple shrines of the Cross Group in Palenque. The king was the prime embodiment of the central cross or world tree. =Warfare= In Maya narrative, warfare includes the warriors' transformation into animals (wayob) and the use of black magic by sorcerers.Montejo In the pre-Hispanic period, war rituals focused on the war leaders and the weapons. The jaguar-spotted War Twin Xbalanque counted as a war deity in the Alta Verapaz; preceding a campaign, rituals were held for him during thirty days, so that he might imbue the weapons with his power.Fuentes y Guzm√°n I 1969: 76‚Äì77 The Yucatec ritual for the war chief (nakom) was connected to the cult of a puma war god, and included a five-day residence of the war leader in the temple, \\"where they burned incense to him as to an idol.\\"Tozzer 1941: 164‚Äì165 In Classic war rituals, the Maya jaguar gods were prominent, particularly the jaguar deity associated with fire (and patron of the number Seven), whose face commonly adorns the king's war shield. The Palenque Temple of the Sun, dedicated to war, shows in its sanctuary the emblem of such a shield, held up by two crossed spears. =Kingship= The early Spanish writers have little to say about the king's (or, as the case might be, queen's) ritual duties. Nonetheless, one finds the Yucatec king (halach uinic) referred to as 'bishop',Thompson 1970: 167 so that, in virtue of his office, the king appears to have had a leading role in major public rituals. In the Classic period, the rituals of kingship were the most important rituals of the Maya court. The term 'theatre state' (Geertz), originally coined for the Hindu kingdoms of Bali, could also be used for describing the Classic Maya kingdoms; it suggests the cohesion of the state to be dependent on elaborate royal rituals through which status differences between aristocratic families could find expression. On monuments, the king sometimes assumes a dancing posture suggestive of his participation in the rituals that were staged on the large plazas where the royal stelas stood.Inomata 2006 On important occasions, the royal impersonator would be shown to the crowd while being within a shrine erected on a large palanquin (as on a wooden lintel from Tikal's Temple IV). The specific rituals engaged in by the king are only rudimentarily known. The Post-Classic K ªiche ª king together with his dignitaries regularly visited the temples to burn offerings and pray for the prosperity of his people, while fasting and guarding sexual abstinence.Tedlock 1996: 192‚Äì193 As to the Classic Period king, he appears at times (often period-ending dates)Stuart 2011: 264‚Äì265 to be scattering blood, incense or, perhaps, maize. At other times, the king, represented by the hero Hunahpu, is sacrificing his own blood in front of directional trees (murals of San Bartolo), or he is officiating in front of such a tree (temple sanctuaries of Palenque). The king not only took a leading part in ritual, but ritual is likely to have focused on his office as well. The erection of stelae showing the king and dedicated to the day 'King' (Ahaw), which concluded intervals of five 360-day years, constituted a royal ritual by itself. It appears to implicate the king as the divine lord of his own day.Stuart 2011: 256‚Äì262 Inversely, at San Bartolo, the divine hero of the day 'King', Hunahpu, substitutes for the real king. Setting up a stela may additionally have involved the notion of the king as a protective 'tree of life'.Freidel, Schele, Parker 1993: 137‚Äì138 Moreover, in the Classic period, the king is commonly depicted holding a cosmic serpent from whose jaws deities (often those of rain, lightning and fire) emerge; the king's raising and balancing of this serpent, accompanied by his 'conjuring' of the emerging deities,Stuart 2011: 266‚Äì267 may well have been expressed and supported by ritual. =Ancestor worship= During the Classic period, Tikal's North Acropolis consisted of nucleated royal burial temples and is even referred to as a 'necropolis'.Martin and Grube 2000: 43 In Classic-period royal courts, tombs are generally found integrated in the residences of the nobility. Apart from the ancestral remains themselves, sacred bundles left by the ancestors were also an object of veneration.Tedlock 1996:174‚Äì175 Reliefs from the Classic- period kingdom of Yaxchilan also show that royal ancestors were sometimes approached during bloodletting rituals and then appeared to their descendants, emerging from the mouth of a terrestrial serpent (which has been nicknamed 'Vision Serpent'). The monthly feast cycle of the Postclassic kingdom of Man√≠ included a commemorative festival for an ancestral hero viewed as the founder of Yucatec kingship, Kukulcan (a name corresponding to Quichean Gucumatz and Aztec Quetzalcoatl). Around 1500, the incinerated remains of the (male) members of notable Yucatec families were enclosed in wooden images which, together with the 'idols', were placed on the house altar, and ritually fed on all festive occasions; alternatively, they were placed in an urn, and a temple was built over it (Landa). In the Verapaz, a statue of the dead king was placed on his burial mound, which then became a place of worship.Miles 1957:749, quoting Fuentes y Guzm√°n and Las Casas Sciences of destiny =Numerology and calendrics= Apart from writing, the fundamental priestly sciences were arithmetics and calendrics. Within the social group of the priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers as well as the basic day-unit, and ‚Äì particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua ‚Äì to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' to the next one. The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as Howler Monkey Gods, who seem to have been conceived as creator deities in their own right.Braakhuis 1987; Inomata 2001 In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of all the numbers 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.Stuart 2011: 229‚Äì251 =Divination= Like all other cultures of Mesoamerica, the Maya used a 260-day calendar, usually referred to as tzolkin. The length of this calendar coincides with the average duration of human gestation. Its basic purpose was (and still is) to provide guidance in life through a consideration of the combined aspects of the 20 named days and 13 numbers, and to indicate the days on which sacrifice at specific 'number shrines' (recalling the number deities of Classic times) might lead to the desired results. The days were commonly deified and invoked as 'Lordships'. The crucial importance of divination is suggested by the fact that the general Yucatec word for 'priest' (ah k'in) referred more specifically to the counting of the days. K'iche' daykeepers use puns to help remember and inform the meanings of the days. Divinatory techniques include the throwing and counting of seeds, crystals, and beans, and in the past also ‚Äì apart from the count ‚Äì gazing in a magical mirror (scrying), and reading the signs given by birds (auguries); during the Classic period, pictures of such birds were used as logograms for the larger time periods. The mantic calendar has proven to be particularly resistant to the onslaughts of time. Nowadays, a 'daykeeper', or divinatory priest, may stand in front of a fire, and pray in Maya to entities such as the 260 days; the cardinal directions; the ancestors of those present; important Mayan towns and archaeological sites; lakes, caves, or volcanoes; and deities taken from published editions of the Popol Vuh. People also come to these daykeepers to know about baby names, wedding dates and other special occasions. In the pre-Hispanic past, important divinatory dates relating to the prospects of the entire kingdom were sometimes given a mythological pedigree. At Palenque, for example, the auspicious day 9 Ik', chosen for the enthronement of one of its kings, is also stated to have witnessed, in a distant, mythical past, the enthronement of some of the patron deities of the kingdom.Stuart 2011: 248‚Äì249 =Astrology= What is often called Maya 'astronomy' is really astrology, that is, a priestly science resting on the assumption of an influence exerted on earthly events by the movements of heavenly bodies and constellations. The observation of sky and horizon by present-day Mayas relates chiefly to celestial signs of seasonal change relevant to agriculture;Tedlock1992: 187‚Äì190 stars connected to the hunt and specific hunting animals;Cruz Torres 1965: 356 and stars sending certain illnesses.Hull 2000: 2‚Äì3 With but few exceptions, the names of stars and constellations is all that has been preserved, and the influence of star lore on social and professional activities beyond agriculture and on individual destiny can no longer be traced.cf. Milbrath 1999: 37‚Äì41 In this respect, other Mesoamerican groups (such as Totonacs and Oaxacan Chontals) have fared better. The far more sophisticated pre-Hispanic Mayan astrology is mainly found in the Early Post-Classic Dresden Codex, and concerns lunar and solar eclipses and the varying aspects of Venus in the course of its cycles; animals and deities symbolize the social groups negatively affected by Venus during its heliacal rising as the Morning Star. The Paris Codex contains what some consider to be a zodiac.Love 1994: 89, 93ff Some of the Books of Chilam Balam testify to the great interest the colonial Maya had for the astrology of their conquerors. Cosmology =Earth, sky, underworld= Horizontally, the earth is conceived in various ways: as a square with its four directional or, perhaps, solstice points, or as a circle without such fixed points. The square earth is sometimes imagined as a maize field, the circular earth as a turtle floating on the waters. Each direction has its own tree, bird, deity, colour, and aspect, in the highlands also its own mountain. Vertically, the sky is divided into thirteen layers, and Classic period deities are sometimes linked to one of the thirteen skies. By analogy with the 'Nine-God' mentioned together with the 'Thirteen-God' in the Chilam Balam book of Chumayel, the underworld is often assumed to have consisted of nine layers. However, the Popol Vuh does not know such a ninefold division, and Classic period references to layers of the underworld have not been identified. In the world's centre is a tree of life (the yaxche 'ceiba')Thompson 1960: 71 that serves as a means of communication between the various spheres. In Palenque, the tree of life is a maize tree, just as the central world tree in the Borgia Codex; a curving bicephalic serpent hovers around it, which some believe to embody the ecliptic.Freidel, Schele and Parker 1993: 78ff. The king was probably identified with the tree of the centre and is usually shown to carry the bicephalic serpent as a ceremonial bar. Besides worshipping a central maize tree, the king commonly sits or stands on a mountain containing the maize, perhaps as a guardian of the kingdom's maize supplies. In the Classic period, earth and sky are visualized as horizontally extended serpents and dragons (often bicephalic, more rarely feathered) which serve as vehicles for deities and ancestors, and make these appear from their maws. Other serpents, shown as vertically rising, seem to connect the various spheres, perhaps to transport the subterranean or terrestrial waters to the sky. Dragons combine features of serpent, crocodile, and deer, and may show 'star' signs; they have been variously identified as the nocturnal sky and as the Milky Way. =World endings and beginnings= Within the framework of the post-Classic cycle of thirteen katuns (the so-called 'Short Count'), some of the Yucatec Books of Chilam Balam present a deluge myth describing the collapse of the sky, the subsequent flood, and the re-establishment of the world and its five world trees upon the cycle's conclusion and resumption.e.g., Roys 1967:99‚Äì101 The lightning deity (Bolon Dzacab), the divine carriers of sky and earth (the Bacabs), and the earth crocodile (Itzam Cab Ain) all have a role to play in this cosmic drama, to which a much earlier, hieroglyphic text from Palenque's Temple XIX seems to allude.Vel√°squez Garc√≠a 2006 The Quichean Popol Vuh does not mention the collapse of the sky and the establishment of the five trees, but focuses instead on a succession of previous mankinds, the last of which was destroyed by a flood. For the Classic Mayas, the base date of the Long Count (4 Ahau 8 Cumku), following upon the completion of thirteen previous baktun eras, is thought to have been the focus of specific acts of creation.see Freidel and Schele 1993:59‚Äì107 Through the figures of two so- called 'Paddler Gods', the mythology of the Maya maize god appears to have been involved. References to 4 Ahau 8 Cumku events are few in number (the most important one occurring on Quirigua stela C), seemingly incoherent, and hard to interpret. They include an obscure conclave of seven deities in the underworld (among whom the deity Bolonyokte') and a concept of 'three stones' usually taken to refer to a cosmic hearth. Humanity =Soul and 'co- essence'= The traditional Mayas believe in the existence, within each individual, of various souls, usually described in quasi-material terms (such as 'shadow', 'breath', 'blood', and 'bone'). The loss of one or more souls results in specific diseases (generically called 'soul-loss', 'fright', or susto). In Classic Maya texts, certain glyphs are read as references to the soul. Much more is known about the so-called 'co-essences', that is, animals or other natural phenomena (comets, lightning) linked with the individual (usually a male) and protecting him. In some cases (often connected to black sorcery), one can change into co-essences acting like a sort of 'werewolves' (see also nagual). The Classic Maya grandees had a whole array of such soul companions, which were called wayob, and carried distinct hieroglyphic names.Grube and Nahm 1994 Among them were spook-like creatures, but also violent stars. =Afterlife: Underworld, paradise and the sea= In the pre- Spanish past, there may never have existed a unified concept of the afterlife. Among the Pokoman Maya of the Verapaz, Xbalanque was to accompany the dead king,Coe 1975:91, quoting Fuentes y Guzm√°n which suggests a descent into the underworld (called xibalba 'place of fright') like that described in the Popol Vuh Twin myth. The Yucatec Maya had a double concept of the afterlife: Evildoers descended into an underworld (metnal) to be tormented there (a view still held by the 20th-century Lacandons), while others, such as those led by the goddess Ixtab, went to a sort of paradise. The ancestors of Maya kings (Palenque tomb of Pakal, Berlin pot) are shown sprouting from the earth like fruit trees which, together, constitute a blissful orchard. The so-called 'Flower Mountain' has more specifically been interpreted as a reference to an aquatic and solar paradise. To judge by the marine faunal remains found in Classic tombsFitzsimmons 2009: 68‚Äì71, 90‚Äì92 and by the accompanying aquatic imagery, this sea paradise may have been the Maya variant of the rain god's paradise (Tlalocan) in Central Mexican religion.cf. Thompson 1970:301 Powers of the Other World =Ancestors= The traditional Maya live in the continual presence of the '(grand)fathers and (grand)mothers', the usually anonymous, bilateral ancestors, who, in the highlands, are often conceived of as inhabiting specific mountains, where they expect the offerings of their descendants. In the past, too, the ancestors had an important role to play, with the difference that, among the nobility, genealogical memory and patrilineal descent were much more emphasized. Thus, the Popol Vuh lists three genealogies of upper lords descending from three ancestors and their wives. These first male ancestors ‚Äì ritually defined as 'bloodletters and sacrificers' ‚Äì had received their private deities in a legendary land of origins called 'The Seven Caves and Seven Canyons' (Nahua Chicomoztoc), and on their disappearance, left a sacred bundle. Already during the Classic period, ancestral deities (the three 'patron deities' of Palenque) and ancestral bundles (Yaxchilan) are in evidence. In Chiapas at the time of the Spanish conquest, lineage ancestors were believed to have emerged from the roots of a ceiba tree;Thompson 1960: 71, quoting Nu√±ez de la Vega comparable beliefs still exist amongst the Tz'utujiles.Carlson and Prechtel 1991 =Heroes= Within the group of the ancestors, a special category is constituted by the heroes, best known through the sixteenth-century Quichean epic of the Maya hero twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. In the Classic period, the adventures of these two heroes ‚Äì only partly coinciding with those of the Popol Vuh ‚Äì were known all over the Mayan area. Specific ancestral heroes occur among various traditional Maya groups, such as the dwarfish Ez among the Yucatec Mayas;Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 335‚Äì337 Juan K'anil among the Jacaltecs of the northwestern highlands;Montejo 1984 Ohoroxtotil, the jaguar slayer, among the Tzotziles of Chiapas;Guiteras 1961: 182‚Äì183, 262 and Kumix among the Ch'orti' Mayas.Hull 2009; Braakhuis and Hull 2014 The heroes' actions can belong to a relatively recent past, and be semi-historical, or have occurred in the deep past, and be primeval; but in principle, the heroes can be addressed in prayer, and receive some form of worship. Sometimes, they have merged with specific military saints.e.g., Vogt 1976: 159‚Äì161 =Deities= In Maya folk religion, the members of the Catholic Trinity, the Virgin Mary, a number of saints, the (arch)angels and the devil have usually merged with traditional deities, patron deities, and ancestral heroes. Angels, for example, generally represent rain deities. The complex figure of the Mam ('Grandfather') Maxim√≥n venerated in Santiago Atitlan is another example of such syncretism. The deities governing the wild vegetation, the game animals, and the fishes are often referred to as 'Owners' or 'Masters' (Due√±os), like the 'Mountain-Valley' deities (or mountain spirits) of the highlands. More generally, the living Earth and its male personification is often called 'World' (Mundo). From the multitude of deity names occurring in early-colonial sources (and especially in the medical 'Rituals of the Bacabs'), about twenty have been linked to deity figures from the three Postclassic codices and their correspondences in the corpus of Classic ceramic representations; these have been assigned letter names (Schellhas-Zimmermann-Taube classification). The codices demonstrate that deities were permanently being arranged and rearranged according to cultic criteria which usually are not immediately accessible to us. Moreover, Maya deities typically operate within various fields, changing attributes accordingly.Vail 2000 The ancient Maya concept of 'deity', or 'divinity' (k'u in Yucatec, ch'u in Ch'ol, and qabuvil in ancient Quich√©) is poorly understood, but can by no means be reduced to a mere personification of natural phenomena. The life-cycle of the maize, for instance, lies at the heart of Maya belief, but the role of the Maya maize god transcends the sphere of agriculture to embrace basic aspects of civilized life in general (such as writing). Deities have all sorts of social functions, related to such human activities as agriculture, midwifery, trade, and warfare. Moreover, they can be the patrons of large kin-based or ethnic segments of society, as shown by the four deities presiding over the four wards of Itzamkanac;Scholes and Roys 1968: 56‚Äì57 the Popol Vuh Triad (including Tohil); and possibly also by the Palenque Triad (G[God] I, II, and III) and its Classic Period analogues elsewhere. With the above provisos, the main deities depicted in the codices may be roughly divided into the following groups (the names given are 16th-century Yucatec): *The principal creator god (Itzamna); *sky gods, particularly the sun god (Kinich Ahau), the Maya moon goddess, and the patrons of the Venus cycle; *gods of the weather and the crops, particularly the rain god (Chaac), the lightning god (Bolon Dzacab), the aged deities of the underground, terrestrial water, and thunder (Bacabs), and the Maya maize gods; *occupational gods, particularly those of merchants (Ek Chuah, god L), black sorcerers (god L), midwives (goddess O, Ixchel), hunters with snares (Tabay); *specific Owners, represented by a god of the hunt (God Y); *a young goddess of eroticism and marriage (Goddess I); *death gods (God A and God A'); and *the deified Hero Twins. Whereas, within the three fully Mayan codices, the group of male deities is highly differentiated, the female functions seem largely to have been concentrated in the young goddess I (the 'White Woman') and the old goddess O (the 'Red Woman'). Missing from the codices, but important in Classic iconography are, amongst others, an ocean deity characterized by a shark tooth set in the mouth (the 'God I' of the Palenque Triad) and some of the Maya jaguar gods associated with warfare. The Postclassic Maya deity Kukulcan ('Feathered Serpent'), tutelary deity of the Toltec invaders and of the Maya kings deriving their legitimacy from them, is nearly absent from the codices. =Animal persons= Animal persons (usually mammals and birds, but including insects) appear to enjoy a relative autonomy which is lacking in the case of the animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they mirror human society in playing varying social roles. In the Popol Vuh, for example, grandfather 'Great White Peccary' and grandmother 'Great White Coati' act as healers, whereas the owl messengers of the lords of the underworld wear military titles. Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The howler monkey, for example, is commonly depicted in the social role of a writer and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians. In the Dresden Codex, certain animals (dog, jaguar, vulture, owl, parrot, frog), most of them clothed as human beings, are seated in between deities, and seem thus to be treated on a par with the latter, while other animals, again acting as human beings, fulfill important ritual roles. In the New Year rites, for example, an opossum traveller introduces the patron of the incoming year. Similarly, in the Paris Codex, a turkey person alternates with deities in offering the head of the lightning deity (god K) to the new king. Animal persons are repeatedly shown interacting with Goddess I. =Spooks, demons, and bush spirits= The power exercised by a deity is legitimate, and this legitimacy justifies offerings and sacrifice. Unlike the gods of disease and death, spooks (apparitions) and demons have no such legitimacy. Whereas spooks ‚Äì like the spectres of the dead ‚Äì only frighten (and in that way, can also cause disease), demons are devourers; in practice, however, the borderline can be thin. One of the best-known spooks is an attractive woman maddening the men who give in to her lures (known in Yucatec as the xtabay 'Female Ensnarer'). Spooks of the Tzotziles include such figures as the 'charcoal-cruncher', the 'one who drops his own flesh', and 'white-bundle'. The boundary between spooks like these and the wayob of the Classic period is not always entirely clear. The principal demon of the Tzotzil area is the 'Black-man' (h?ik'al), a kidnapper and rapist.Blaffer 1972 An ancient Mesoamerican bird demon, which the Popol Vuh calls Vucub Caquix, severed the limbs of his victims, and was already known in Preclassic Izapa. In order to terrorize their enemies, kings would at times assume the shapes of spooks and demons. Bush spirits (such as the 'Wild Man' or Salvaje) belong to the frightening denizens of uninhabited areas, without, however, being apparitions. =Goblins and dwarfs= According to Yucatec belief, the indigenous priests can create goblins (aluxob) who, if properly attended, will assist the farmer in his work by protecting his field, having the rain deities visit it, and thus making the maize grow.Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 116; Gabriel 2000: 247 In the same area, dwarfs, and also hunchbacks, are associated with antediluvial times; they perished in the flood when their stone boats sank.Thompson 1970: 340‚Äì341 The childlike dwarfs and hunchbacks of Classic iconography often accompany the king and the Tonsured Maize God. They repeatedly show aquatic features and may, in such cases, be identical to the dwarfish assistants of the deities of rain, lightning, and thunder already mentioned in Aztec sources (the Tlaloqueh). Mythology There is considerable diversity in recent religious narrative, which embraces stereotypical, moralizing stories about encounters with mountain spirits and supernatural 'Owners', as well as myths concerning heroes and deities. Particularly in tales concerned with the creation of the earth and the origin of useful plants, a reworking of Catholic imagery is often noticeable. Among the best-known myths are those about the opening of the Maize Mountain by the Lightning deities, the struggle of Sun and his Elder Brethren, and the marriage of Sun and Moon.Thompson 1970: 330‚Äì373 The early-colonial Quichean Twin myth, set out in the Popol Vuh, has not been transmitted, although fragments are recognizable in recent narrative; the name of one of its heroes, Xbalanque, was around the turn of the 20th century still known in the Alta Verapaz. Early creation mythology is found in the Popol Vuh and in some of the Books of Chilam Balam. Notwithstanding the progress in hieroglyphic decipherment, the most important sources for Classic mythology are still scenes painted on pottery (the so-called 'ceramic codex') and monumental iconography. The two principal narratives recognized thus far are about demi- gods close to humanity (the Hero Twins and the principal Maya maize god), and have to be reconstructed from scenes in which often, narrative and ritual concerns are intertwined. Religious mobilization Like other Mesoamerican populations, Maya societies since the Spanish conquest have known a series of religious 'revitalization' movements, of a more or less violent character, and in response to intolerable exploitation. These movements usually followed appearances of supernatural beings. In Chiapas (early 18th and late 19th century), the ensuing cults focused on female saints such as the Virgin Mary in the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 and Saint Rose of Lima,Reifler Bricker 1981: 53‚Äì69 whereas in eastern Yucat√°n during the late 19th-century 'Caste War', crosses, dressed as women,Reifler Bricker 1981: 108 and especially a 'Talking Cross', played the main roles. In the Alta Verapaz, the role of saints and crosses was assumed by male mountain deities demanding the destruction of the coffee plantations and a return to the ancient ways.Dieseldorff 1926: 17‚Äì18 In each case, certain individuals were recognized as mouthpieces of the supernatural entities involved. Ethics As ethical systems, polytheistic religions like those of the Maya are difficult to compare with the monotheistic world religions. However, the idea of 'covenants' Monaghan 2000: 38‚Äì39 between deities and human beings is common to both. Fulfilling the ritual requirements of the 'covenants' should ideally lead to a state of harmony. The archaic practice of human sacrifice should first of all be viewed within this framework.

In a long coaching career Bonfr√®re managed several teams in Africa and Asia. He guided Nigeria to their victory in the 1996 Olympic Games. Playing career Between 1963 and 1985 Bonfr√®re scored 50 goals in 335 league appearances for MVV Maastricht, his only club. Coaching career =Nigeria= Bonfr√®re led Nigeria national football team to the 1996 Summer Olympics gold medal in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the coach of Al Ahly in Egypt in 2002/03 where he lost the league at the very last match with a difference of two points. His contract was terminated after that. He also led Nigeria to the 2000 African Cup of Nations co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana. Bonfr√®re led the Nigerian team to the finals, where they lost to Cameroon by penalties. On June 7th 2018, Jo was offered a 3 bedroom apartment by the Nigerian government as part of the promise made by late General Sanni Abacha after winning the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics for Nigeria. =Asia and South Korea= He was hired to coach the South Korea national football team in June 2004 to replace Humberto Coelho, who was forced to quit after a draw with the Maldives national football team in a FIFA World Cup qualification. The Dutch coach got off to a promising start by crushing a highly rated German squad of World Cup stars such as Michael Ballack and Oliver Kahn, 3-1, with a young Korean team in a friendly match in December 2004. In 2005, South Korea qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup under him, but a string of disappointing losses thereafter fueled fan and media ire against Bonfr√®re. He resigned on 23 August that year after poor results in the East Asian Football Championship and a World Cup qualifier loss against Saudi Arabia. Korea Football Association then hired Dick Advocaat as its third Dutch coach, and Advocaat angered his predecessor by saying he will be another Guus Hiddink, not Bonfr√®re. Bonfr√®re joined former Chinese Super League champions Dalian Shide on a one-year contract in the 2007 league season. Despite the team finishing fifth in the league, they were never in contention to win the title and opted not to extend his contract. On 29 June 2011, another Chinese Super League club Henan Construction announced that Bonfr√®re would lead the team on a 1+1 contract and fight for staying in the Super League. In February 2015, Bonfr√®re was added to the MVV youth team staff.Jo Bonfr√®re en Johan Dijkstra sluiten aan bij technische staf MVV A1 - MVV On 25 May 2017, China League One club Baoding Yingli Yitong F.C. signed a one-year contract with Bonfr√®re.

On September 21, 2006, University President William C. Powers, Jr. named Dr. Woodruff the inaugural dean of undergraduate studies. He is best known for his work on Socrates, Plato, and philosophy of theater. A beloved professor, he often teaches courses outside his Ancient Greek Philosophy specialty, including literature courses and specialty seminars, often for the Plan II program.  Biography  Born in New Jersey (though raised in western Pennsylvania), Woodruff attended Princeton University, where he completed a major in Classics in 1965. His studies then took him to Merton College of Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar, where he completed a Bachelor's Degree in Literae Humaniores in 1968. Inspired by the Socratic beliefs on rule of law, he served in the United States Army in the Vietnam War from 1969 to 1971, during which time he attained the rank of Captain. Returning to the United States, he again attended Princeton University, where he completed his doctorate in Philosophy, studying under Gregory Vlastos.

It gets its common name for its usage by Native American women to treat menstrual cramps and other female ailments, due to its astringency. Description Conopholis americana is parasitic on the roots of woody plants, especially oaks (genus Quercus) and beech (genus Fagus). The only part of the plant generally seen is the cone-shaped inflorescence, which appears above ground in spring. The entire structure is a yellowish color, turning to brown and achieves heights of to tall. =Stems and leaves= Stout and unbranched to thick stems. Since C. americana does not photosynthesize it also does not have true leaves; it has instead simple, ovate, tiny scales long and brown, which appear underneath each flower. =Flowers= Conopholis americana produces spikes of yellow to cream flowers densely crowded all around the stem. Each flower is 5-parted, to long, tubular with a swollen base and facing downwards. As the flowering spike matures and begins to wither and becomes brown throughout the summer and often persisting through the winter, by which time it has become shriveled and black. There is no noticeable floral scent. =Fruits and reproduction= Each flower is replaced by a seed capsule that is longer than it is wide and contains many small seeds. This plant spreads to new locations by reseeding itself. =Roots= The root system is parasitic on the roots of oak trees (Quercus spp.); dependent on the host tree for its nourishment, the suckers of the parasitic roots cause the formation of large rounded knobs on the roots of the host tree. Distribution Found growing on roots in wooded ravines in every state of the United States east of the Mississippi River.

A kyai (kyaa-ee) is a (Javanese) expert in Islam. Origins The word is of Javanese origin. Sometimes it is spelled kiai. Traditionally, students of Islam in Indonesia would study in a boarding school known as a pesantren. The leader of the school was called kyai, as a form of respect. The traditional word for a teacher in Islam is ustad, which is a Persian word. There are many ustads in Indonesia who teach the religion, but most of them do not have a boarding school. Education Kiai were educated in various pesantren: A student in a pesantren is called a santri. After the founding kyai of a pesantren dies, his son or another santri may take over the supervision of the school, and would then be called kyai. It is possible for a large boarding school to have several kyai living and teaching there. However, most pesantren have a few hundred students, with only one person who is called kyai. The other teachers in the school are called ustadz. Many Indonesian Muslims consider a kyai to be higher ranked than an ustadz because a kyai runs his own boarding school and has mystical abilities. Function Kiai were distinct from the pangulu, the state officials: A kyai is not a cleric in the same way as a priest in Christianity or Buddhism. There is no governing body that ordains or authorizes a kyai. Likewise, no organization can defrock a kyai or remove him from his position. The reason is that a kyai has his position and authority because people will listen to what he says.Ronald Lukens-Bull 2005 A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Pp. 96-97. Some Indonesians refer to a widely regarded kyai as an ulama. This word is actually the plural form of the Arabic word alim which means knowledgeable person. Through common usage in Indonesia, the word ulama grew to signify a high-level kyai, even though this is a grammatical misuse of the Arabic word.Zamakhsyari Dhofier The Pesantren Tradition: A Study of the Role of the Kyai in the Maintenance of the Traditional Ideology of Islam in Java Tempe, AZ: Arizona State University Program for Southeast Asian Studies Monograph Series. In legend, if not in fact, a kyai combines the skills and roles of both the Islamic scholar and the Sufi master (sheikh or syehk). Stories abound about kyai that can perform such feats as:Ronald Lukens-Bull 2005 A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Pp. 97-99. # Fly to Mecca for mid-day prayers and be back in the pesantren for the afternoon repast; # Walk through the rain without getting wet; # Meditate by the ocean until the waves stop moving; # Heal the sick; # Have secret knowledge about someone that can help that person solve personal problems. Other uses =Heirloom items= Kyai is also a common honorific for important heirloom items in kratons in Java, like gamelan, chariot, and kris. For example, gamelan used in annual Grebeg celebration in Yogyakarta is called Kyai Sekati, itself divided into two instrumental sets: Kyai Gunturmadu and Kyai Nagawilaga. Meanwhile, Yogyakarta's royal chariot of is called Kyai Garudayaksa. =Wali Songo= In some parts of Indonesia, famous students of the Wali Songo mystics are referred to historically as kyai or kiai or ki. One of them, Ki Ageng Gribig, is said to have returned from Mecca with a small kind of pastry which did not spoil during the long journey. To commemorate this feat, the people of Jatinom hold a festival each year, wherein thousands of these little cakes (called apem) are blessed and tossed out to participants. The main road from Klaten to Boyolali in Central Java, which passes through the town of Jatinom, is officially named after Ki Ageng Gribig, though known colloquially as Jalan Boyolali (Boyolali Road).

The site fully opened in September 1942 and was the base of No.11 Operational Training Unit (OTU) flying the Vickers Wellington medium bomber until the RAF moved out in August 1945, the station was officially closed on 3 April 1946. The airfield was then transferred to the Ministry of Supply and became the home for the Rocket Propulsion Establishment until the mid 1990s. The site is now the Westcott Venture park, which is the registered address for 37 companies.  History  = World War II = RAF Westcott opened in September 1942 along with its satellite station RAF Oakley. The airfield was equipped with 3 concrete runways. Shortly after its opening, No. 11 Operational Training Unit (OTU) moved in from RAF Bassingbourn operating the Vickers Wellington bomber. The OTU played a major part in the training of bomber crews during World War II, as part of this training, trainees would be sent on air navigation and leaflet dropping exercises. During and after the last few days of fighting in May 1945, No. 11 OTU and the airfield were involved in Operation Exodus: repatriation flights for almost 53,000 Allied personnel who had been prisoners of war in Germany. The RAF moved out in August 1945 and the airfield was transferred to the Ministry of Supply on 3 April 1946. = 1946-1990s = After World War II, rocket research and development took on new urgency after Germany's success with the V-1 and V-2 rocket, the Rocket Propulsion Establishment was set up at Westcott in 1946 and German scientists relocated to the site to continue their research into liquid rocket propellant. The site developed liquid propellant motor for various rockets and missiles, including the Blue Streak ballistic missile and the Europa-1 space rocket launch vehicle. This site was regarded as so secret it was not marked on Ordnance Survey maps. In 1977 Westcott and the Waltham Abbey research station merged to form the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment. Westcott continued to be at the forefront of liquid propellant research until the mid 1990s, developing the LEROS liquid engine used for the Mars missions of the 1990s. The surviving test stands and control rooms were designated as either Grade II* or Grade II listed building and named the K2 stand as a \\"nationally unique test stand for the testing of large solid fuel rocket motors which has contributed to significant UK defence systems and the space programme.\\" Present day The site, which extends to 650 acres, is now the location of Westcott Venture Park, a business park for light industry. Being the largest business park in Buckinghamshire, it is currently the registered address for 37 companies. The business park is still home to a division of the Norwegian company Nammo, which continues the design and manufacture of the LEROS rocket engines. Reaction Engines Limited began construction on a rocket test facility in 2017 to develop their SABRE rocket engine with the goal to have the new building ready for use in 2020. In 2016, the UK Government announced plans to invest ¬£4.12 million to develop a National Propulsion Test Facility at the site, allowing cost-effective testing and development of propulsion engines. The plan involves building a new vacuum facility which will allow the simulation of high altitude testing of thrusters up to 2 kN, upgrade an existing testing chamber and open a smaller 1N thruster test chamber for the community to use. The European Space Agency will advise and oversee the initial design phase. Westcott Venture Park has also unveiled plans for a new solar photovoltaic power station in 2018 with a planned capacity of more than 15 megawatts (MW) and will cover 76 acres. This will make the business park carbon-negative since the park will generate more power than the business will use in a year.

It is home to a lighthouse which stands near the top of the northern end of a reef. The reef is about one kilometre long. At the southern end of the reef, there is an island known locally as \\"seagull island\\", due to its large population of seagulls. The southern side of Castle Rock is known as Christmas Bay. Castlepoint is approximately one hour's drive from Masterton. The population of urban Castlepoint was 50 as recorded in the national Census of 2018. Castlepoint was so named in 1770 by Captain Cook who was struck by the similarities of Castle Rock to the battlements of a castle. The Maori name for the area is Rangiwhakaoma, which translates as 'where the sky runs'. Smaller cetaceans such as dolphins frequent around Castlepoint while larger whales such as southern right whales and humpback whales may be visible from the shores during their migration seasons. A book chronicling the history of Castlepoint, including Castlepoint Station, Castle Point Lighthouse and the local fishing industry was published in October 2010 by Hedleys Books of Masterton. Castle Rock is a landmark in Castlepoint and is 162m high. It includes a walk through woods and over bridges and is approximatley 45 minutes long. Mataikona Sand Dunes are an area of large sand dunes approximately 30 minutes north of Castlepoint towards the Matakona River mouth. Marae The local Whakataki marae is affiliated with the NgƒÅti Kahungunu hap≈´ of Te Hika a PƒÅpƒÅuma ki Wairarapa. Its wharenui burned down 1960.  Annual Horse Races  Remote from other settlements Castlepoint's beach has been home since 1872 to an historic annual horse race meeting when \\"local station hands rode on farm hacks competing for bottles of rum and any stray coins\\".  Lighthouse  Castle point The Castle Point Lighthouse is a lighthouse near the village of Castle point in the Wellington Region of the North Island of New Zealand. It is owned and operated by Maritime New Zealand. In the early days of the 20th century Castle Point was one of the few lighthouses with easy access to a school. The Creamer family came there in 1918 or 1919 and the eldest son Eric had to complete five years of education in three years, so that he could go on to secondary school, there having been little education in previous locations where the family had been stationed. This aspect of the Keeper's lives seems to have been overlooked by the Marine Department. The light was built in 1913 and was originally fueled by oil. In 1954 the oil lamp was replaced with an electric one powered by a local diesel generator. This was subsequently replaced by a connection to the mains grid in 1961. The lighthouse, is popular with holiday makers and the lighthouse itself is sometimes referred to as \\"The Holiday Light\\". Completed on 12 January 1913, it was one of the last manned lights built in New Zealand, but has been fully automated since 1988 and is now managed from a central control room in Wellington. Castle Point Lighthouse Profile (from the Maritime New Zealand website) It is a popular tourist attraction for holidaymakers to the area, although it is not open to the public. The lighthouse is built out of steel sheets riveted together. This is an unusual method of construction for a lighthouse and the only one so built in New Zealand. At sea, the light can be seen 22 miles away, and was used by sailors coming from South America to establish a point of reference when making for Wellington Harbour. A camera set up at the top of an outcrop looking down on the lighthouse gives people a chance to see it in all its glory with a live feed on castlepointlighthouse.com. In December 2017 the lighthouse was controversially installed with multi-colour LED up-lights which would light the exterior of the lighthouse all year round at a cost of $35,000. Many Wairarapa region residents feel the lights are 'gaudy' and a source of unnecessary light pollution.

The new school, built on the Glendale site, was named after the township. The township was named from the Scottish immigrants who were descendants of the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders, a Scots regiment of the British Army that fought with distinction during the French and Indian War and then disbanded. The 71st (Highland) Regiment was later re- raised during the American Revolution and fought with distinction throughout that war. The original school was built on November, 1924 consisting of one two story building with thirteen classrooms for grades one through twelve. A total enrollment of three hundred sixty-seven enthusiastic and dedicated students opened wide its doors of learning. On May 25, 1925, Seventy First inaugurated its first graduation. A class consisting of five members achieved the first commencement exercise. The original building now houses the Seventy- First Classical Middle School. In 1962, a new building was built across the street and in the fall of that same year, the first classes were held in the new building. The wing at the back was added in 1965. The school was growing so rapidly that huts were added in 1966 and each year until 1972 and again in 1973 until 1976. Another new wing was added in 1967. The spring of 1973, new tennis courts, new football bleachers, and other improvements were added to the athletic field. In the 1972-1973 school year, Seventy-First received full accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. A new vocational building and a new green house were officially opened for the 1974-75 school year. Construction of the newest wing was begun in the fall of 1988 for use in the 1989-1990 school year. Student enrollment continued to soar until it reached 2,544 in 1976-1977 school year making Seventy-First the most populated secondary school in North Carolina. Douglas Byrd High School was opened in 1972 to alleviate the growth at Seventy-First, as was Westover High School in 1977. Since 1977, enrollment has been stable. Another major change for the system occurred in the summer of 1985 when the Cumberland County and the Fayetteville City school systems merged to form the Cumberland County School System, making this the fourth largest system in the state. To date, Seventy-First High School is one of the seventeen high schools in the Cumberland County school system. The community is a composite of suburban housing areas, mobile home parks, apartments, and farm land. Seventy-First High School exists for the benefit of the youth of its community and is dedicated to that purpose. The principals of the school since its opening have been: *1924-1926 J.W.

The chip implements a full-duplex serial communications interface that enables the extension of an internal bus segment to one or more external physical devices. The external devices are mapped into local, physical address space and appear as if they are on the internal bus. Multiple VLYNQ devices are daisy-chained, communication is peer-to-peer, host/peripheral. Data transferred over the VLYNQ interface is 8B/10B encoded and packetized. VLYNQ is the name of a proprietary interface developed by Texas Instruments. It is used for TI's broadband products, such as modems and WLAN, voice broadband processors, digital media processors, and OMAP media processor chips. The ACX111 WLAN cards used in AR7 devices look like mini-PCI, but actually they are dual mode cards, that talk both, mini-PCI and VLYNQ.Design_Connector_VLYNQ_bus.html VLYNQ bus Description Details The VLYNQ bus signals include 1 clock signal [CLK], and 1 to 8 Transmit lines [TX0 and TX1 ‚Ä¶], and 1 to 8 Receive lines [RX0 and RX1‚Ä¶..]. All VLYNQ signals are dedicated and driven by only one device. The transmit pins of one device connect to the receive lines of the next device. The VLYNQ bus will operate at a maximum clock speed of 125 MHz. However the actual clock speed is dependent on the physical device with the VLYNQ. So a device may have a clock speed other than 125 MHz. For example, a device may have an internal 100 MHz [maximum] clock rate, or external 80 MHz [maximum] clock rate. When clocked at 125 MHz, a single T/R pair then delivers an effective data throughput of about 73 Mbit/s (for single, 32-bit word transfers), while a dual T/R pair implementation delivers 146 Mbit/s, and a maximum eight-channel version delivers 584 Mbit/s. In-band flow-control lets the interface independently throttle the transmit and receive data streams. If data packets contain four or 16 words, some of the overhead is eliminated. So on a single channel, data bursts of four words per packet can deliver an effective throughput of 133 Mbit/s. With 16 words per packet, the throughput goes up to 178 Mbit/s. With the maximum eight channels, an effective throughput of over 1400 Mbit/s can be achieved with 16 words per packet. Both the direction and clock source may be software configurable [may be device dependent]. Software may also be used to set the internal clock speed [may be device dependent]. Unused clock lines are held high via an internal pull-up. Unused RX or TX lines may require an external 47k pull-down resistor [may be device dependent]. Software selectable internal pull-downs for signals may be provided on some devices.

It is located at around . It is the main town of the Tsqaltubo Municipality of the Imereti province. It is famous for its radon- carbonate mineral springs, whose natural temperature of enables the water to be used without preliminary heating. The resort's focus is on balneotherapy for circulatory, nervous, musculo-skeletal, gynaecological and skin diseases, but since the 1970s its repertoire has included \\"speleotherapy\\", in which the cool dust-free environment of local caves is said to benefit pulmonary diseases. Tskaltubo was especially popular in the Soviet era, attracting around 125,000 visitors a year. Bathhouse 9 features a frieze of Stalin, and visitors can see the private pool where he bathed on his visits. Currently the spa receives only some 700 visitors a year, and since 1993 many of the sanatorium complexes have been devoted to housing some 9000 refugees, primarily women and children, displaced from their homes by ethnic conflict in Abkhazia. Geography Tskaltubo is located in the central part of west Georgia, in the lowland, at the foot of the Southern Caucasus, 98 meters above the sea-level, in the valley of the river Tskaltubo. It is in 9 km distance from Kutaisi and 240 km from Tbilisi. The climate in Tskaltubo is warm and moderately mild. Average annual temperature +15C; average annual precipitation 76%. Winters here are warm and mild. Tskaltubo is rich with karst caves. Such as ‚ÄúSatsurblia\\", \\"Prometheus\\" and \\"Sataplia\\" which provide visitors with breathtaking examples of stalactites, stalagmites, curtains, petrified waterfalls, cave pearls, underground rivers, and lakes. The temperature in the cave is always 13-15C. Satsurblia cave is the first and only Speleotherapic - object in the Caucasus Region. The cave has unique climatic environment that gives it the ability be transformed to a recreational tourism destination for individuals with respiratory diseases ( e.g. Bronchial asthma, etc.). As for Speleotherapy, or underground climate-therapy it is a set of recreational therapy methods based on the use of underground microclimate to improve health. Prometheus cave is one of the most beautiful and longest caves in Georgia. Visitors can see amazing halls of Argonauts, Colchis, Medea, Love, and Prometheus and of Iberia, the excursion can be finished by foot or by a 15-minute boat ride an underground river . Sataplia reserve is famous its footprints of herbivore and carnivore dinosaurs. The reserve also has a karst caves. There is a transparent platform that gives an outstanding view of Imereti's landscape beauty. Architecture Another significant factor in Tskaltubo is its architecture which is basically a synthesis of Stalinist period classical style and of Georgian ethnic decor with Gothic and Roman features. History The \\"Waters of Immortality\\" in Tskaltubo were probably known already in the 7th-9th centuries, when the oldest historical records are dated. Since the 18th century several foreign researchers gave word of the healing properties of these springs:Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science (1782); J.Klaproth (1815); A. Jolenberg (1897). By 1920, after chemical analysis had revealed the uniqueness of the water, Tskaltubo was officially declared a medical spa resort and achieve the status of city in 1953. In 1920 the territory of Tskaltubo became state property and it acquired the function of balneology resort. The building of the resort started in 1926. In 1931, a decree by the government of Georgian Soviet Republic designed Tskaltubo as a spa resort and balneology center. In 1950-1951, architects I.Zaalishvili and V.Kedia prepared a project plan for the town where sanatoriums form a circle around a park, recreation and balneology facilities. Tskaltubo was divided into the following zones: balneological, sanitarian and living. In 1953, Tskaltubo became the important spa-resort during the Soviet times. At different times, there were built 19 sanatoriums and pensions, nine baths, resort park, Branch of Scientific Institute of balneology and physiotherapy. As one of Georgia's flagship historic spa towns, the town is still popular for the qualities of its waters. Tskaltubo mineral waters are famous for their stable physical and chemical composition and they are categorized as slight radon chloride ‚Äìmagnesium waters. The high-performance spa preventive effect of mineral waters is conditioned by their complex content and particular fusion of salt components. In Tskaltubo the bath taking has a peculiar technique, the treatment take place under the constant running water ( mineral water constantly flows in and out of the spa) and the water permanently preserves physical-chemical and mineral compositions. The water consists of six components and it penetrates into the human body via pores. Constituent ingredients in number are far below the permissible minimum, temperature of water is 33-35 C, it is very soft, pure and odorless. Mineral water baths The unique radon-carbonated waters are Tskaltubo's major mineral resource. They emerge at a comfortable temperature for bathing (35¬∞C), allowing them to be directly transferred from springs to the baths without cooling or heating. The Spring No. 6, is the largest thermal bath working today. It was built in 1950 exclusively for Joseph Vissarionovich Jughashvili (Stalin), the soviet union leader of the period. Private baths and dachas of Stalin and Lavrenti Beria are still kept in the city. The mineral water flows directly into Buildings #1 and #6. There are five pools of mineral water, 37 individual cabins for bathing mineral water and 17 hydro-massage cabinets. In 2015 Tskaltubo-BE Healthy was established.

It originates in the prefectural capital of Kagoshima in Kagoshima Prefecture and terminates in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture. =Kagoshima Prefecture= At its northern terminus, National Route 58 meets National Routes 3, 10, 224, 225, and 226. The segment in the city of Kagoshima has a length of about and also carries National Route 224 towards the Port of Kagoshima. At the port, National Route 224 leaves National Route 58, continuing by ferry to the city of Tarumizu beyond the stratovolcano, Sakurajima. Heading south by ferry, the highway resumes its land route in Nishinoomote on the northern end of Tanegashima. It travels alongside the western coast of the island within Nishinoomote. Upon crossing into the town, Nakatane, the highway ventures inland, heading towards the central district of the town. Continuing south the highway crosses into the town, Minamitane on the southern end of Tanegashima. After traveling through the center of Minamitane, the highway turns northwest and heads towards the west coast of the island where the maritime section of the highway resumes at the Port of Shimama. Unlike the previous maritime section, no ferry carries the highway from Shimama to its next land segment on Amami ≈åshima. In all, the highway has a length of on Tanegashima. Resuming its land route in the Amami ≈åshima city of Amami, the highway travels southeast across the island from its northeastern tip. The highway crosses through the town of Tatsugo and then returns into the city of Amami. After passing through the central part of the city, the highway curves to the south, traveling towards the island's eastern coast. It then curves to the west, heading towards the south-central part of the island. It curves to the south once and crosses into Setouchi. Upon reaching the island's southern coast, the highway curves to the southwest, heading towards the Setouchi's central district on the southwestern end of Amami ≈åshima. In the center of the town the highway's land section ends once again. Like the previous maritime section, there is no ferry between Amami ≈åshima and the highway's land section on Okinawa. In all, the highway has a length of on Amami ≈åshima. =Okinawa Prefecture= The highway's final land segment starts near the Port of Oku in Kunigami at the northern tip of Okinawa Island. It travels around the edges of Cape Hedo from the point's eastern side to the west coast of the cape and then curves to the southwest running along the western coast of the island to the highway's southern terminus in Naha. Further to the south along the coast, the highway crosses into the village of ≈ågimi. In the village the highway meets National Route 331 on the northern shore of Shioya Bay. As the highway leaves the village and crosses in the city of Nago, it curves to the west. It then meets National Route 505, and proceeds to the south, leaving the coast and crossing the bottom of the Motobu Peninsula. As the highway approaches central Nago, it has an intersection with the Nago-higashi Bypass, an alternate route of National Route 58. Upon reaching central Nago, the highway meets the Nago Bypass, an alternate route of National Route 449. Curving to the south, the highway meets the mainline of National Route 449. Here the highway meets the western coast of Okinawa once more and continues traveling alongside it away from central Nago. Near the southern limits of the city the highway meets the northern end of the Okinawa Expressway, a tolled, limited-access highway that parallels National Route 58 to the east from Nago to Naha. The national highway continues south along the coast passing through the rural villages of Onna and Yomitan. In the town of Kadena, the highway curves its way around the northwestern and western edges of the United States Air Force's Kadena Air Base. Proceeding south, National Route 58 passes through the town of Chatan and its American Village, a shopping and entertainment district that boast American themes. The town is also home to the United States Marine Corps Camp Lester. The highway curves to the southwest after leaving Chatan and enterning the city of Ginowan, home to the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. The highway travels along the northern edge of the installation, here an auxiliary route of National Route 58, the Ginowan Bypass, travels further to the north along the coast. The two highways meet after they cross into the city of Urasoe. Another US military installation, Camp Kinser, is located to the west of the National Route 58 in Urasoe while the central district of the city lies to the east of the route. Crossing into Naha, the last stretch of the highway is six lanes wide in the city. The highway is flanked by shops and sites that display the influence the American occupation had on the city. The highway ends at a junction just north of Meiji Bridge with National Routes 330, 331, and 390. History Government Highway 1 in 1954 The precursor to what would eventually become National Route 58 on Okinawa was originally established in the 15th century during the reign of Sh≈ç Kinpuku, ruler of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Sh≈ç Kinpuku ordered the construction of a road, called the that traveled all of the way around Okinawa. National Route 58 is mostly situated along the western route of the Yanbaru-kokud≈ç. The Yanbaru-kokud≈ç was designated as an Okinawa Prefecture Road in 1915 between the cities of Nago and Naha. The direct predecessors to National Route 58 in Okinawa are Government Highway 1, which was maintained by the Government of the Ryukyu Islands as well as Military Road 1 and Military Road 10 during the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. Together these highways functioned as the island's main road. Known then as Highway 1, the route was mainly developed as a high-speed logistics route for the US military. The military's vehicles took priority over the local Okinawan driving community, who were not allowed to pass US military convoys and vehicles. After the return of the Ryukyu Islands from the United States to Japan on 15 May 1972, the aforementioned highways were all re-designated as a part of National Route 58. It remains the only Japanese national highway to be given a two-digit number following the reclassification of the Primary and Secondary National Highways as the General National Highways in 1965. Until 30 July 1978, traffic on National Route 58 in Okinawa Prefecture drove on the right rather than the left. After the 730 switch, Okinawa joined the rest of Japan in driving on the left in accordance to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.

The land, referred to by Penn as the Manor of Moreland, was located on the main branches of the Poquessing and Pennypack Creeks in the most northern portion of Philadelphia county. In 1718, the Court of Quarter Sessions created the Township of Moreland from previous More family holdings as well as two strips of land between the Byberry and County Line Roads.Thomas, Joe, A Synopsis of the History of Moreland Township and Willow Grove, p. 5.

Jeffries, under contract with Model Products Corporation (MPC) at the time, told CEO George Toteff about the project. A make of vehicle had not yet been chosen for the project. Toteff then told his friend Jim Wangers of these developments. Wangers was working with Pontiac promotion and advertising at the time and saw the show as a huge promotional opportunity for Pontiac. After making the deal, Jim Wangers supplied two base 389 4-barrel 1966 GTO convertibles with automatic transmissions to be converted into Monkeemobiles. MPC was in turn given exclusive rights to market a model kit of the Monkeemobile. They eventually sold over seven million copies of the kits. The car The Monkees in 1966 Two cars were contracted, one for the television program and the other as a promotional car, for touring car shows around the United States. Both cars were built in the span of four weeks. The first version originally featured a 6-71 supercharged engine, a solid mounted rear axle (no springs) and extra rear end weight. This was to enable the car to \\"pop wheelies\\". Because the car had too much power and was difficult to drive, the original blower set up was removed and a dummy blower was fitted, over a stock Pontiac Tri-Power.Rothermel, Rich. \\"Dean Jeffries: Runnin' Flat Out Since 1951\\", in Rod & Custom, April 2000, p.66 caption The second car was used as a touring car for auto shows and promotional events. Before its transformation into a Monkeemobile, the second car was first seen on TV as Major Nelson's GTO in I Dream of Jeannie. Both were used on The Monkees TV series, one during the first season and both throughout the second season. Several notable differences between the two cars exist, such as the size of the door logo and the styling of the fan belt cover and blower lines, which can be used to tell the difference between the two cars. Later years After the television show ended, both cars were offered back to Dean Jeffries for $2,000 each,Rothermel, p.71. who had right of first refusal. He declined to purchase the cars because he felt he could build new ones cheaper. The \\"TV car\\" (aka car # 1) followed the Monkees on tour only to be left in Australia in 1968. It later resurfaced in Puerto Rico as a hotel courtesy car. To this day, there is still no hard information on how the car made its way to Puerto Rico, and it was sold at government auction in 1992 for $5,000 when the hotel went out of business. Though basically as it was built, the car did get some restoration work done when bought, and it was used as the example for the Ertl Company 1:18 scale die-cast toy, The Monkees 1997 TV reunion show, \\"Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees\\" and the 2001 \\"Cars & Guitars Of Rock N Roll\\" display at the Petersen Automotive Museum . It is now in the hands of a private collector in Northern New Jersey. The \\"show car\\" (aka car #2) was purchased by custom car designer, George Barris. This car would be the most visible during the years. Barris later went on to use and display the car for promotions at many large and small events. In 2006 the car went through a major restoration. Even though it became a 100 point show car, many changes and upgrades were made. In January 2008, Barris, through Barrett-Jackson in Scottsdale, Arizona, auctioned the car for $360,000. It now resides in the hands of a private collector in southeastern Michigan. The car, though in great condition, now has spongy brakes.Press Release: \\"Barrett-Jackson Shatters Records at 2008 Scottsdale Event\\". - Barrett-Jackson Auction Company - January 22, 2008Golfen, Bob and Peter Corbett. - Gooding auction sells top car\\". - Arizona Republic. - January 19, 2008 Barris also had Dick Dean, who had helped Jeffries build the two originals, make a copy, identified by yellow trim on the headlight bezels, tan seats (instead of the original white upholstery), and other variations.

It is developed following Open Source principles, LGPL licensed, and can be used freely. It runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris and OS X and is based on OpenGL. Its main features are advanced multithreading and clustering support (with sort-first and sort-last rendering, amongst other techniques), although it is perfectly usable in a single-threaded single-system application as well. It is not part of Khronos Group. History It was started, just like many other systems, at the end of the scenegraph extinction in 1999 when Microsoft and SGI's Fahrenheit graphics API project died. Given that there was no other scene graph system on the market nor on the horizon with the features the authors wanted, they decided to start their own. OpenSG should not be confused with OpenSceneGraph which is entirely different scene graph API, somewhat similar to OpenGL Performer. Development on both started about the same time, and both chose similar names.  Technology  OpenSG is a scene graph like many others, but with a number of unique features that set it apart from others. It features a blocked state management system to reduce the overhead for state change optimization, highly flexible traversal and other mechanisms to allow run-time exchange and enhancement of core data structures, but the most unusual aspect is its multi- threading approach. Scene graphs are notoriously hard targets for multi- threading, as they contain very large data structures easily consuming hundreds of megabytes of memory. Duplicating these is not an option due to the large overhead. Many scene graphs just lock individual nodes to prevent data corruption due to parallel writes, but that is only a partial solution. The state of the scene graph is represented by the whole scene graph, only protecting individual nodes can still lead to inconsistent results (e.g. when running an asynchronous physics simulation only updating parts of the graph will lead to partial simulation steps being displayed). OpenSG uses selective multi-buffering, by duplicating the small parts of the graph for each thread that needs to be protected while sharing the bulk data like vertex arrays and texture images, and only duplicating these using a copy on write mechanism. Synchronization of the changes for individual threads is done using a change list approach that allows minimal overhead. The same mechanism also allows highly flexible and effective clustering. To synchronize an application running on several machines, only the changes for each frame are sent to each machine and integrated into the local scene graph. This way the distinction between local and remote changes is almost invisible. An application that wants to run on a cluster just needs to open a ClusterWindow that can distribute all changes across the cluster and can very easily drive a Powerwall or a CAVE without having to worry about distribution protocols and other complications.

Goal The goal of hankumdo is to teach people how to defend themselves and at the same time offer them exercises to stay healthy. It also is meant to give practitioners the means to come to a deeper understanding of martial arts principles. It aims to make this easy by using the Korean writing system to systematize the techniques.Myung Jae Nam: Hankumdo bub : Issued at the hankumdo introduction seminars in 1996 History Hankumdo was developed by Myung Jae Nam, who first taught his sword techniques as a separate art in 1986 and was first publicized in 1997 during the 3rd International H.K.D Games. Hankumdo originated from the techniques used in Hankido to defend against sword attacks. Though first presented as a subset of the larger Hankido curriculum under the name hankumdobub (hankumdo techniques), Myung Jae Nam later decided that it was an art that could stand on its own merits and is often taught as a separate discipline. Hankumdo doesn't have clear roots in other sword arts, since Myung Jae Nam never received any formal education in other sword arts. The subset of techniques is quite limited, and consists only of the basics strikes and blocks found in most sword arts. GM Myung organized his sword art, HanKumdo, around the calligraphy of the Korean Hangul alphabet. It is claimed that using the five basic striking techniques one can write the entire Korean alphabet as a series of fencing combinations. In this way, Hankumdo would seem to mirror the tenet of Chinese sword practice which suggests that all sword work can be reduced to the strokes necessary to write the single Chinese character, ‚Äúeui‚Äù. This tenet surfaces routinely among a broad spectrum of Oriental fencing arts and over a wide time frame. Meaning The word hankumdo actually consists of three different words: * Han (Ìïú / Èüì): Korea, Korean culture and mentality (see Names of Korea). * Kum (Í≤Ä / Âäç): Sword * Do (ÎèÑ / ÈÅì): The way Hankumdo can be interpreted as: The way for the Korean people to learn how to handle the sword. Style Hankumdo sword A number of modern Korean martial arts have been influenced by Japanese styles in the 20th century, while the older arts were influenced by the Chinese, which becomes obvious in the Muyedobotongji. Myung Jae Nam however wanted to create a true Korean sword art without any foreign influences. Japanese sword arts developed into the art of man-to-man duelling during the peaceful Edo period and are characterized by a lot of attention to detail under the influence of Zen Buddhism. Traditional Korean arts never underwent this change and were purely taught to soldiers as a way to fight on the battlefield, although this does not mean that in Japanese arts battlefield techniques are not taught. Battlefield fighting is usually characterized by more flowing and ongoing movements. In duel-style fighting a lot of attention is given to the one- strike-one-kill principle, whereas in battlefield-style fighting the emphasis is on keeping the sword in motion and always being ready for the next strike. To give hankumdo a true Korean flavor, Myung Jae Nam used the Korean alphabet, known as Hangul, to teach the basic strikes of the art. right Techniques The basis for all Hankumdo techniques comes from the letters of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. This alphabet consists of 24 characters, 14 consonants (ÏûêÏùå) and 10 vowels (Î™®Ïùå). Since 1997 there have been several revisions of the techniques. In the earliest version the sword techniques reflected the manner in which one would write the characters on paper, thus requiring mastery of only four techniques.Ko Ju Sik: 25ÌïúÍ≤ÄÎèÑÍµêÏû¨(97Ïö©).hwp Hankumdo curriculum : 2005 In the latest revision more techniques were added and the techniques become more elaborate. As a result, the manner of using the sword and of writing the letters may vary. The strikes are being taught from several positions and with several steps, called Gi Bo Haeng (Í∏∞Î≥¥Ìñâ).Myung Jae Nam: Hankumdo bub : Issued at the hankumdo introduction seminars in 1996 The techniques have the same name as the characters followed by the word Begi (Î≤†Í∏∞) which means strike. So the name for the first technique is: Giyeokbegi (Í∏∞Ïó≠Î≤†Í∏∞), because the name for the first character („Ñ±) in the Korean alphabet is Giyeok (Í∏∞Ïó≠). Myung intended to develop a sword-art that would be truly Korean and easy to learn by everyone. For Koreans who already know the Korean writing system, the techniques are easy to remember, as the sword methods follow the standard manner in which the Korean characters are written. Foreigners are advised to learn how to write Hangul before starting with the sword techniques. Because the Korean writing system is fairly easy to learn, foreigners can become facile in the sword basics within a short period of time.  Development  After Myung Jae Nam's death in 1999, the development of hankumdo is overseen by the Jaenam Musul Won Foundation Quite a few changes and additions to the hankumdo curriculum have been made by Ko Ju Sik (Í≥†Ï£ºÏãù), the new technical director of the federation, since then.

Lucey Jr., Vortex Ring Generator: Mechanical Engineering Design For 100Kpsi Operating Pressures, ARL-TR-2096, United States Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, January 2000 --- Includes equations and test results for a prototype vortex ring generator simulating a MK19 40mm grenade launcher. The nozzle of a vortex ring gun is designed to both contain the short pulse of accelerating gas until the maximum pressure is lowered to atmospheric and to straighten the exhaust into an axial flow.Dr. John D. Anderson, Jr., \\"Modern Compressible Flow With Historical Perspective,\\" Second Edition, 1990 McGraw Hill Inc., NY, NY, pp 182-183, 327-329. The objective is to form the vortex ring with the highest possible velocity and spin by colliding a short pulse of a supersonic jet stream against the relatively stagnant air behind the spherically expanding shock wave. Without the nozzle, the high pressure jet stream is reduced to atmospheric by standing shock waves at the muzzle, and the resulting vortex ring is not only formed by a lower velocity jet stream but also degraded by turbulence.Daniel L. Clear, et al., \\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Application To Gun Muzzle Blast - a Validation Case Study,\\" Technical Report ARCCB-TR-03011, August 2003, US Army Armament Research Development And Engineering Center, Picatinny, NJ, Pages 6-7. History =The 1998 US Army project= The United States Army Research Laboratory was asked by the Marine Corps Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate to determine whether vortex rings could be used for non-lethal crowd control. Overall management authority for the study was assigned to the United States Army Materiel Command, with support by ARDEC. Contributors to the study included individuals from the US Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Adaptive Research Incorporated, Berkeley Research Associates, EWS Limited, Johns Hopkins University, Pennsylvania State University, Sara Corporation, and Sonic Development Laboratory.Lucey, G & Jasper, L., Vortex Ring Generator, United States Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD 1998.

Figure 4. MK19-3 40mm grenade launch machine gun. The end product was to be a kit for quickly converting an existing lethal weapon to a non-lethal vortex ring generator that could knock- down an individual or spray him with a dye, malodorous chemical, or incapacitating chemical. The kit, consisting of a nozzle with chemical reservoirs and belts of blank 40mm cartridges modified to detonate at pressures up to 100,000 psi (690 KN/sqN), was being designed for the Navy MK19-3.George K. Lucey Jr., Vortex Ring Generator: Mechanical Engineering Design For 100Kpsi Operating Pressures, ARL-TR-2096, United States Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, January 2000. The 40mm grenade machine gun was selected because firing at 4-10 shots per second resonates with many body parts and causes a stronger impact effect.Rasmussen, G., Human Body Vibrations Exposure And Its Measurement, Bruel and Kjer Technical Paper, 1982. Abstract 1983, Journal of Acoustical Society of America, 73(6) 2229. Single shot field tests performed without optimized nozzles led to the conclusion vortex rings were unsuitable for non-lethal crowd control. This conclusion was reached partly because knock down did not appear to be feasible at the desired range of , partly because of the excessive spillage onto bystanders under the flight path if used to transport chemicals or dyes, and partly because the flight noise and speed enabled it to be easily avoided at the downrange target. The foremost reliability issue with this project was turbulence caused by the high-energy propellant burning outside the barrel. =The Hail cannon= Later commercial solutions overcame some problems of the US Army concept by using less energetic gas propellants through the re-purpose of the Hail cannon which reliably fires vortex rings at one third the speed of sound or better. (Note that Hail cannons have been in use for over a century and do not themselves qualify as \\"later commercial designs\\".)

It was nominated for both a Satellite Award and a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered in 2005. Plot The film details the history of both the New York Dolls and one of its members, Arthur \\"Killer\\" Kane. The film narrates the history of the band from its formation in 1972, through its drug problems and the deaths of several of its members. The central focus of the film, however, is Arthur's life after conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after struggles with alcoholism, drug abuse, an attempt at suicide, and a 1992 beating with a baseball bat (falsely rumored to be related to the Rodney King riots happening at the same time) that left him near death and needing a long recovery. As Kane struggles with both loneliness and poverty, he discovers that he will once again have a chance to perform with the Dolls in London. After overcoming his differences with former band member David Johansen, Kane has a successful performance. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Kane contemplates touring with the reunited Dolls, but plans are cut short by his unexpected death from leukemia. The film features interviews with Morrissey, who arranged the reunion show, as well as other artists such as Chrissie Hynde and Bob Geldof.

Ark clams vary both in shape and size. They number about 200 species worldwide. The shells of ark clams are often white or cream, but in some species, the shell is striped with, tinted with, or completely colored, a rich brown. In life the shell of most species has a top shell layer that is thick brown periostracum affixed to the harder calcareous part of the shell. In some species such as Barbatia, this outer horny covering is tufted at the end of the shell into something that resembles a beard, hence the name Barbatia or bearded one. The group is known as \\"ark shells\\" because species such as Arca have a large flat area between the umbones which, in an undamaged shell, somewhat resembles a deck, with the rest of the shell perhaps illustrating an ancient wooden boat such as Noah's ark is thought to have been. All ark shells have a long straight hinge line with a single row of numerous small and unspecialized \\"teeth\\". This is known as a \\"taxodont dentition\\" and represents an ancient ancestor. This kind of hinge line is also found in the bivalve families Glycymerididae, Nuculidae and Nuculanidae. The thick outer skin or periostracum of an ark clam can act as camouflage, such that the shells can sometimes look like stones when lying on the bottom. Large ark clams, such as Arca zebra, are commonly used as bait, as well as food, throughout the Caribbean. Some ark clams species, such as the blood cockle (Anadara granosa, a.k.a. Tegillarca granosa) are raised in aquaculture, e.g. in the estuaries of China's Fujian coast.

The origin of the names comes from Firghil (√ì Fearghial or Fergal), a descendant of Eoghan, (son of Niall No√≠g√≠allach, the most prolific warrior in Irish history) brother of St. Columcille, and are thus nearest in descent to Columcille. The name Fearghial is composed of \\"fear.\\" meaning man and \\"gal,\\" meaning valour. The leading line of the family were hereditary coarbs of Kilmacrenan, County Donegal. Before the introduction of Christianity, the family was a hereditary line of Druid priests/priestesses. The Chief of the Name possessed the hereditary right of inaugurating O'Donnell as lord of Tirconnell. Not being a powerful or numerous sept they do not appear very frequently in the national records. The records of the Diocese of Raphoe have many references to distinguished ecclesiastics of the name, both as O'Friel and Friel, including one Bishop Florence or Feargal O'Friel (d. 1299). Amhalgaid √ì Frighil was one of the many clergy from Raphoe and Derry who went to Iona - he was elected Abbot of Iona in 1203. Present day Friel (Freel, Freels) is seen more common as a surname than the traditional O'Friel. Statistics relating to the modern distribution of the population indicate that the name is seldom met with outside County Donegal and contiguous areas. The name is very closely associated with the north Donegal, especially Fanad and surrounding areas. Notable descendants include the playwright Brian Friel (born 1929) and the actress Anna Friel (born 1976). Another spelling of the surname is Freel or Freels.

It forms the eastern end of the picturesque and incrementally increased embankment that starts at Tower Bridge known as Shad Thames. The east side of the Dock is Jacob's Island. Geography The dock has had since its excavation a high tidal range, with today a maximum recorded rise and fall of four metres. Furthest inland the bed of the inlet is about one metre above the low-tide mark of the Thames so is empty at many low tides. It was often at low tide slightly watered before 1894 as a final head of water along the Thames is maintained above Richmond footbridge and more surface water drains in Southwark ran into it. The maximum high tide is regulated by use of the Thames Barrier which usually enables the water to stay more than below the embankments. During exceptional tidal surges where the Barrier proves insufficient water levels have topped the walkways adjoining buildings on Shad Thames and Mill Street. The long rectangular inlet opens to the river 420 metres east of Tower Bridge.Grid reference Finder measurement tools St Saviour's Dock is the point where the vestige of the River Neckinger enters the Thames, one of the most reduced subterranean rivers, more of a standard surface water drain today. In the past it described further inlets or outlets to the west. History A community of Cluniac monks resided at elevated Bermondsey Abbey south-east of the site from 1082 onwards. The community began the development of the marshes surrounding their abbey at Bermondsey, cultivating the land and embanking the riverside into a Priory Close spanning 140 acres of meadow and digging dykes. They turned the adjacent tidal inlet at the mouth of the River Neckinger into the priory's dock, and named it Saint Saviour's Dock after their abbey's patron. This provided a safe landing for Bishops and goods below the traditional first land crossing, the congested stone arches of London Bridge. According to the Winchester Episcopal Register, the Bishop of Winchester when returning from abroad was expected to land at Bermondsey shores.Winchester Episcopal Register, Pontoise, fol. 155a John Stow, a 16th-century English historian and antiquarian had the following to say about the area, \\"In the south end whereof was sometime a priory or abbey of St. Saviour, called Bermond's Eye in Southwark, founded by Alwin Childe, a citizen of London, in the year 1081.\\" St Saviour's in the Arts Charles Dickens set portions of his novel Oliver Twist in the area of Shad Thames, at a time when it was an area of notorious poverty known as Jacob's Island. He set Bill Sikes's den at the east of Shad Thames in buildings adjacent to St Saviour's Dock. It is here that Sykes falls from a roof and dies in the mud, probably of St Saviour's Dock. Dickens gives us a vivid description of what this unsavoury place must have looked like at the time of the novel, :\\". . . crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem to be too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into it - as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations, every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage: all these ornament the banks of Jacob's Island.\\" St Saviour's dock was also featured in the 2002 videogame The Getaway, serving as the final area in the game for both characters' campaigns.

The film explores the status of individual liberties in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the approval of the USA PATRIOT Act. The film was directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Oz creator Tom Fontana. It stars Glenn Close, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ken Leung, Bruno Lastra and Dean Winters. The film was first screened at the Monaco Film Premiere with Lumet in person presenting it, in the presence of Fontana. Different cuts of the film exist. There is supposedly a 2-hour version. German TV showed an 86-minute version. The version released on DVD in the U.S. is 56 minutes. Plot The film is built around two main parallel stories, each containing almost identical dialogues. One story line involves Linda Sykes (Gyllenhaal), an American woman detained in the People's Republic of China, being interrogated by a military officer (Leung). In the other storyline, Sharif Bin Said (Lastra), an Arab man detained in New York City, is interrogated by two FBI agents (Winters and Close). Both characters are graduate students detained with no hard evidence and interrogated about unspecified activities which may or may not be related to terrorist plots. In the course of the increasingly brutal interrogations, both Sykes and Bin Said are strip searched against their will by their interrogators and are subjected to a cavity search.

Translated literally, the name Nanj≈ç means \\"southern castle\\". Many castle ruins, called gusuku in the Okinawan language, can be found throughout the city. The modern city of Nanj≈ç was established on January 1, 2006, from the merger of the town of Sashiki, and the villages of Chinen, ≈åzato and Tamagusuku (all from Shimajiri District). Nanj≈ç has an area of 49.69 km¬≤ and, on the date of its inception, a population of 41,305, and a density of 831.25 per km¬≤. Of the eleven cities in Okinawa Prefecture, Nanj≈ç has the smallest population. It does not have a separate police station nor a high school. For those services, citizens have to refer to the neighbouring towns of Yonabaru and Yaese. The city hosts a fire station responsible for Chinen, ≈åzato and Tamagusuku and parts of Yaese, while Sashiki is served by a separate station. The city's main economical activities are agriculture and tourism. Important crops include sugarcane, for sugar and vinegar production, and turmeric, a popular medicinal herb in Okinawa.

Power NI Power Procurement Business manages the group's power purchase agreements. Power NI was the former customer supply business of Northern Ireland Electricity, known originally as NIE Supply and then after its separation from the rest of NIE, as NIE Energy. Both it and the Power Procurement Business \\"were separated from NIE on 1 November 2007 in accordance with the requirements of the 2003 EU Electricity Directive which required the independence of the distribution system operation function.\\" In 2010 Viridian sold Northern Ireland Electricity, including the NIE name, to the Electricity Supply Board - the state-owned electricity company of Ireland. As a result, NIE Energy was no longer allowed to use the NIE name, and it rebranded as Power NI on 25 July 2011. =Energia= Energia was founded in 1999 and became the first independent supplier in Northern Ireland. Within a year it had entered the Irish business electricity market. By 2003, Energia had established itself as Ireland's leading independent energy business supplying over 30% of large industrial electricity requirements.

It was funded by the European Union, and the bulk of the work was done between 2001 and 2003. The database draws on British, Dutch, French and Spanish ships' logbook records for the immediate pre-instrumental period, 1750 to 1850.  Logbooks in review  Logbooks from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century had previously been used in case studies of individual events of historic or climatic interest. CLIWOC established early ships' logbooks as another source for those seeking to understand climate change, to be used alongside proxy and instrument data. The observations were made at local noon every single day, and cover most of the world's oceans - only the Pacific Ocean lacks detailed coverage. This volume of data was not available by any other means.  Interpreting the data  In researching the data, CLIWOC staff found that the data need to be treated with caution, and subjected to careful scrutiny. The range of information - wind force terms and directions, and general weather descriptions - is consistent between the different national sources. The data was primarily based on observations made by experienced officers. Though each book used consistent terms to refer to wind speeds, these values were not always consistent between logbooks. The researchers chose to standardise the terms into their Beaufort scale equivalents. The vocabulary used also differed between the national sources - British mariners used a relatively narrow range of terms, while sailors from the Netherlands, Spain, and France used a wider set of descriptions. Researchers found that the majority of wind force entries were accounted for by twelve or so terms, allowing the group to prepare a dictionary defining most wind force terms in use. This multi-lingual dictionary has also been published.  Data verification  In order to establish the reliability of logbook records, the researchers looked at readings taken where ships were in convoy or travelling in close company. These voyages often lasted several weeks, giving large samples. The research showed that there was a consistently high degree of correlation in recorded wind forces and recorded wind directions. On a number of occasions, the records showed small but persistent differences between absolute wind force records prepared on ships of different sizes. This was adjudged not to materially influence the scientific outcome of the project, but remains a matter for further investigation. It was also necessary to correct the data to modern norms, both for wind speed and for wind direction - some books recorded data by reference to magnetic north, rather than true north. Precise navigational methods were not widely used until late in the study period, so it was necessary to correct latitude and longitude using specifically designed software.  The database  An initial version of the database was released in late 2003, as a CD-ROM and via the CLIWOC website. The data structure is based on the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) format. The data is now available as an Open Office Spreadsheet, a Tab-Delimited Text File, and a Geopackage at the popular website HistoricalClimatology.com. The database includes information on date and time of each observation, the latitude and longitude of the recording vessel, its country of origin. wind direction and wind force. Where available - usually only towards the end of the survey period - instrumental observations are also included.  Achieving CLIWOC's objectives  After the CLIWOC project ended in 2003, the researchers claimed a number of successes. According to the project's website, these included: * Established a freely-available database of calibrated climatic data that will be of value in climatic studies; * Confirmed by objective means the reliability of logbook data; * Provided a dictionary of terms that allows other scientists to decipher more readily the descriptions contained in logbooks * Developed a statistical algorithm by which fields of collated logbook data can be used to reconstruct atmospheric pressure fields over the oceans The CLIWOC database is also being used as an extension of the instrument-based records contained in the I-COADS dataset. The database was used to feed wind force and direction into statistical models, which in turn produced monthly pressure field reconstructions for the Indian and the South and North Atlantic Oceans. These models provide information for researchers into climate change over the oceans in the century from 1750. It also allows estimates of such measures as the North Atlantic Oscillation and Southern Oscillation indices for this period. By the time the project closed in 2003, the Spanish logbooks have been almost completely studied. Over 50 per cent of Dutch and over 90 per cent of British and French logbooks remained unexamined - each of these sources contains around 100,000 observations. All sources include many observations taken at times other than local noon; these observations have not been studied in any depth.

Greensborough Press: MelbournePhotograph from University of Adelaide Library website MacCallum, Monica: Jones, Frederic Wood (1879‚Äì1954), Australian Dictionary of Biography Accessed 27 October 2011. Biography Jones was born in London, England, and wrote extensively on early humans, including their arboreal adaptations (Arboreal Man), and was one of the founding fathers of the field of modern physical anthropology. A friend of Le Gros Clark, Wood Jones was also known for his controversial belief in the view that acquired traits could be inherited, and thus his opposition to Darwinism. He taught anatomy and physical anthropology at London School of Medicine for Women, University of Adelaide, University of Hawaii, University of Melbourne, University of Manchester and the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Jones was president of the Royal Society of South Australia in 1927, and was awarded the RM Johnston Memorial Medal by The Royal Society of Tasmania in 1925 and the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1941. He was elected President of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1943 to 1945. In 1910 in London, he married Gertrude Clunies-Ross, the fourth daughter of George Clunies-Ross. Tarsian hypothesis Jones favoured a long separate, non-anthropoid ancestry for humans. He believed that science should search as far back as the primitive tarsioid stock to find a sufficiently generalised form that would be the common ancestor of man, monkeys and the anthropoid apes. The tarsian hypothesis of Jones, which he held to from 1918Wood Jones proposed the Tarsian hypothesis on the 27th Feb. 1918 at a lecture entitled \\"The Origin of Man\\" at King's College, London, later published in Animal life and human progress (1919). ed. A. Dendy, Constable, London. Wood Jones followed with the booklet The Problem of Man's Ancestry (1919) discussing his theory the same year, followed by three other books defending the theory: The Ancestry Of Man (1923), Man's Place Among the Mammals (1929) and Hallmarks of Mankind (1948). until his death, claimed that the human line of development did not diverge from that of apes or monkeys but from much earlier, before the Oligocene 30 million years ago, from a common ancestor with a primitive primate group of which the only other survivor is the Tarsier. Wood Jones in his The Ancestry Of Man (1923) described his Tarsian hypothesis as follows: Wood Jones explained common structural features between Man and the apes (and monkeys) through convergent evolution. In 1948 he wrote: Philosophy Jones rejected organised religion and idea of an anthropomorphic deity. He believed there was a cosmic mind behind nature. He defended the holistic philosophy of Jan Smuts and was a strong critic of Darwinism. His philosophical views are discussed in his book Design and Purpose (1942).Bowler, Peter J. (2001).

His most famous role was Hermann in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Evans was born in Cwrtnewydd, Cardiganshire, Wales. In all, he sang some 45 roles ‚Äì most of them major ones ‚Äì at Covent Garden from 1946 ‚Äì when, as one of its three principal tenors, he became a founder member of the Covent Garden Opera Company ‚Äì to his retirement in 1975. In that time, he sang more roles and more performances at the Opera House than any other artist. Those roles included Steva in the first British stage performance of Jen≈Øfa, Zinovy in the British premiere of Katerina Ismailova, The Interpreter and A Celestial Messenger in the premiere of Vaughan Williams' The Pilgrim's Progress, Andres in the first Covent Garden Wozzeck and Captain Davidson in Richard Rodney Bennett's Victory. In addition, he was Dmitri in the company's first Boris Godunov, Hermann in the first Covent Garden Queen of Spades under Kleiber, Gustavus in the first Masked Ball performed at Covent Garden since the War, Aegisthus in the first post-War Elektra, Hellenus in The Trojans conducted by Kubel√≠k, Narraboth in the Brook-Dal√≠ Salome, and Froh in the first post-War Covent Garden Ring.  Early life  The son of a farmer and the youngest ‚Äì by eight years ‚Äì of 13 children, Evans heard the voice of Enrico Caruso over the radio when he was a young boy. From then on his only ambition was to be a singer, despite his father's ambitions for him to become a banker or an architect. Completely untaught, Evans practised both 'preaching' in the declamatory 'Welsh chapel' style and singing in a barn-cum- boilerhouse on the farm. He received no encouragement as a boy ‚Äì being always told that he sang too loudly. At 11 he entered the local Eisteddfod as a singer unsuccessfully, but by the age of 17 he had improved enough to steal the show at an end of term concert at his secondary school in Cei Newydd. He went on to win various prizes at local Eisteddfodau as a baritone.  First steps in singing career  The opportunity to take up singing professionally came when Evans (by now an articled pupil to the County Architect) was heard singing 'Loch Lomond' by a talent scout in a pub called The Irish House, Piccadilly, while on a rugby trip to London in 1935. He was taken immediately to The Odd Spot nightclub in London's West End, from where he was referred to Arthur Fagg, conductor of the London Choral Society, who knew Dawson Freer, a singing teacher at the Royal College of Music. One week later, Evans became a pupil of Freer's ‚Äì who began by telling him that he sang too loudly. These early lessons helped Evans to establish himself as a professional singer, but he felt that his voice and vocal technique improved immeasurably when, later in his career, the Royal Opera arranged for him to continue his studies ‚Äì this time with the Italian maestro Luigi Ricci in Rome. For 18 months, Evans studied with Dawson Freer, using up his legacy from his father ‚Äì who had died in 1927 ‚Äì to support himself and pay the six guineas for every ten singing lessons. Running out of funds, Evans took on a milk round in Camberwell ‚Äì for the Royal Arsenal Co-Operative ‚Äì getting up at five o'clock each morning and, eventually, progressed to the round in Coldharbour Lane in Brixton. Some 18 months after meeting Freer, Edgar gave his first audition. As a result Lilian Baylis offered him a contract to sing as a chorister, under the direction of chorus master Geoffrey Corbett, with the Sadler's Wells Opera Company in 1937 on a salary of ¬£3 a week ‚Äì the same wage he was getting as a milkman.  World War II  From September 1939 to June 1942 he was a member of the Police Reserve ‚Äì again on wages of ¬£3 a week ‚Äì having been turned down for service in the armed forces ‚Äì he was dogged by kidney problems throughout his life. Throughout the war, he was singing in shows for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) and ENSA, entertaining the troops, under the direction of Walter Legge and performing with artists including Maggie Teyte, Joyce Grenfell and many others. After 18 months, he left the police to concentrate on performing, and, in all, he sang in over 500 concerts during the war. In the latter years of the war and when hostilities ceased, Edgar toured the main theatres in the UK and Europe, singing with the 'Anglo- Russian Merry Go Round Company' performing in a number of cities, including Paris.  Post-war career  For a while, he was in Bernard Delfont's production of Gay Rosalinda at the Palace Theatre, in London, under the musical direction of Richard Tauber. He later worked for Delfont again in a show in Ryde, on the Isle of Wight. A chance meeting with Henry Robinson, formerly stage manager at Sadler's Wells, resulted in Evans applying for an audition with the newly formed Covent Garden Opera Company. Singing \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" from Tosca and the \\"Flower Song\\" from Carmen, he was chosen from scores of tenor hopefuls from around the world and progressed successfully through three auditions to receive the offer of a contract from the Administrator, David Webster, in the middle of August 1946. His first roles were as the Bird God and Lover in Purcell's The Fairy-Queen in a cast that included Michael Hordern, Constance Shacklock, Margot Fonteyn and Moira Shearer. He made his Covent Garden debut, deputising for Heddle Nash, as Des Grieux in Manon, under the direction of Reginald Goodall. He became one of the first British singers to sing in opera abroad after the War when Erich Kleiber took him to sing in Wagner's Ring in Rome, with the Rome Opera. Later, he was the tenor soloist in Beethoven's Choral Symphony when Kleiber conducted the work at Covent Garden at a concert to help establish an artists' pension fund.  Reviews  From that first appearance as Des Grieux to his farewell performance, as the butler in The Visit of the Old Lady by Gottfried von Einem at Glyndebourne in 1974, Evans was a well-respected member of the music world. His acting and vocal ability evoked comparison with the very best and elicited reviews such as: His voice has a pleasant timbre and is produced with ease. But the most notable thing about his performance was the fact that it realised perfectly the elegant as well as the sentimental character of the melodic line. (Daily Telegraph, April 1947, on his debut as Des Grieux in Manon) 'As the cheerful but unfortunate King of Sweden (in A Masked Ball), Edgar Evans follows in the line of some of the greatest tenors who have ever sung in opera, including Jean de Reszke and Caruso.' (Education, 27 November 1953) Of that production of Masked Ball in 1953 ‚Äì singing with Gobbi ‚Äì Evans commented: \\"Hearing Gobbi reminded me of Ricci's teaching. It inspired me to sing the best I ever sang.\\"  Later career  Within three weeks of returning from Ricci in Rome, the higher part of his vocal range now completely secure, Evans sang Calaf in Turandot under the baton of Sir John Barbirolli. He regularly demonstrated his remarkable strength of voice by singing several major roles including Pinkerton (in Madama Butterfly), Don Jose (Carmen), Max (Der Freisch√ºtz) and Peter Grimes in the same week. Eventually the stress of this punishing schedule caught up with him and he was forced to rest for 20 weeks. After this he never resumed the preeminence among principal tenors at Covent Garden that had been his. Subsequently, he conducted his share of masterclasses and adjudicated at singing competitions. Even in his later years, he had a regular procession of singers all anxious to learn his secrets of vocal technique and his opinion of their vocal talents and abilities. On his retirement from Covent Garden, Evans was invited by Sir David Willcocks to join the teaching staff at the Royal College of Music. For ten years he taught vocal technique there and many singers can pay tribute to his masterly teaching. His final public appearance as a soloist was at the wedding of Robert (Bob) and Helen Little, at Marshalswick Baptist Free Church, St Albans, on 18 October 1980. He sang \\"Ombra mai f√π\\" from Handel's opera Xerxes. He sang with leading singers; with leading orchestras, both in Britain and in Europe, and worked with leading conductors including Erich Kleiber, Karl Rankl, Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir John Barbirolli, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Sir Georg Solti, Otto Klemperer, Rudolf Kempe and Carlo Maria Giulini. Among those to whom he felt he owed a special debt of gratitude was Peter Gellhorn who, as a repetiteur and conductor at Covent Garden, taught Evans the part of Hermann in The Queen of Spades in the remarkably short time of just 14 hours. He sang the title role in Peter Grimes and Captain Vere (Billy Budd) after Peter Pears had initially brought these characters to theatrical life. He sang Dmitri in Boris Godunov, in English, under Clemens Krauss, and later in Russian; Steva in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa under Rafael Kubel√≠k; the Drum Major in Alban Berg's Wozzeck, under Kleiber; Calaf in Turandot under Barbirolli and many more roles. Barbirolli and Kleiber were among Evans' favourite conductors, closely followed by Kempe and Giulini. Only the recording studio failed to do justice to Evans's robust, romantic voice. Appearances as Melot in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde (HMV) under Furtw√§ngler; Britten's Albert Herring (Decca), with the composer conducting, and his recording of \\"Nessun Dorma\\" from Turandot are all that remain to stir the memory. He married Nan (n√©e Walters, died December 1998) on 19 August 1939. Their son Huw died in June 1999, and Evans had two grandchildren; Rebecca and Edward. Evans himself died in Northwick Park Hospital Harrow. References  Literature  *G.

The game was to use a modified version of the SPECIAL role-playing system, which had been implemented in the Fallout series. Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine, Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games, such as 3D graphics and real-time camera movement. In Torn, the player assumed the role of a wanderer, who was cursed to bring misfortune to people and places around it. Under a king's orders, the player undertook quests to clarify a series of conflicting prophecies. Unlike several other Black Isle Studios games, the game was to take place in an original world titled \\"Torn\\" instead of a traditional Dungeons & Dragons location. Gameplay Torn was to use a modified version of the SPECIAL system; combat occurred in quasi-real-time, rather than strictly being turn-based. To achieve this, Black Isle Studios created the \\"recovery system\\", in which action points were used to determine the amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time. Action points were spent with each action, and based on what percentage of an acting character's total action points were used, that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again. For example, if two characters expend half of their action points, they will attack each other at the same speed, regardless of the point totals for each character. Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement, using items, or switching equipment, which was always allowed, though it reset the recovery time. Like Fallout, the game was not to support character classes; instead, the designers opted for a system where a player defined their character by the skills and special abilities selected when leveling up. For example, a character with skill choices of stealth and assassination would become the rough equivalent of a \\"rogue\\". The system would have allowed players to choose their characters' race, which would change the types of abilities selectable. =Companions= A player character with two companions. Torn was to allow the player direct control over only the protagonist character. However, up to five artificial intelligence-controlled \\"companions\\" could be hired at once, and would have replaced a conventional adventuring party. Companions would have interacted with one another, obligating the player to find companions who worked well together. Torn would have introduced a unique method for the player to communicate with and control allies; altering their behaviour through conversation, and a command menu and hot key-driven command system which allowed the player to give companions commands at any time. The system was based around the concept of simple behaviors, such as \\"Attack,\\" which could be combined into complex strings. Companions could be ordered to attack, support, defend themselves, follow the player character without attacking, and/or remain behind. It was also possible for the player to command them to carry these orders out in \\"aggressive\\" or \\"passive\\" manners. Lastly, commands and manners could be \\"leashed\\" to other party members or the player character; for example, \\"support the entire party aggressively,\\" or \\"support another companion passively.\\" Depending on the playable character's personality, and the orders companions were given, their level of co-operation would vary. Companions would have followed commands to the best of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying. While these features were publicized, Feargus Urquhart later stated that \\"even at the end of our work on Torn, we were still considering going back to a system that gave players direct, full control over the party members\\". =Magic system= Torn was to contain four types of magic: Chaos, Order, Alchemy and Summoning. Order magic primarily consisted of healing, protective, and empowering spells. Conversely, Chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, detrimental status afflictions, and invisibility spells. Alchemical magic was used to create or alter potions to achieve more powerful effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements (such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior imbued with the Water element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage. Lastly, Summoning magic was to consist of \\"Call\\" and \\"Gate\\" spells, the former summoning entities able to exist for a set duration of time, or until slain. Summoned creatures behaved in different manners; one type might simply defend the caster, while another worked to heal the caster and his or her allies. Gate spells opened a portal, allowing different things access to the game's world. Lead designer David Maldonado called the resulting spells \\"generally amongst the weirdest in the game,\\" with the effect often being a combination of \\"normal\\" spells fired simultaneously. Unlike Black Isle Studios' previous games, Torn would have used a \\"mana point\\" system. Each spell cast would deplete mana points; when fully depleted, a spell-caster would have been unable to cast spells until their mana had been restored. Certain races were more adept at casting certain types of magic than others, increasing the importance of racial choice in how the player wished to experience the game. Setting and plot Torn's background plot established an omnipotent being, dubbed \\"the Architect,\\" as the ultimate creator of the game's universe. The Architect created a number of god-like beings, who in turn created the world \\"Torn\\". The gods eventually divided into three separate factions, each pursuing a different philosophy. One faction worshipped Chaos, believing in constant alteration of the world, while another worshipped Order, believing that all things should remain unchanged; between these two was a third faction, which promoted balance between chaos and order. The game's various races were originally created for combat purposes by the three factions of gods, as the deities struggled to dominate Torn with their respective viewpoints. The name of the game's world was to have been derived from this conflict, due to the ravaging of the world which took place. In the end, the Architect banished the feuding Chaos and Order factions to the ethereal realms of \\"nightmare\\" and \\"dream\\", respectively, and left Torn in the hands of the faction that advocated balance. While isolated, the Order and Chaos factions continued influencing the world's development, although their segregation forced them to act indirectly through agents still residing in Torn's world. Resulting from the ability of Torn's inhabitants to draw energy from the separate realms occupied by the gods of Chaos and Order, magic became available. Black Isle Studios stated on multiple occasions that their goal was to create a world that was both familiar to role-playing game fans, while simultaneously new. David Maldonado once commented on this in an interview with IGN: > \\"I feel that a sense of familiarity and association is a powerful thing, and > may be used to heighten a player's emotional experience in the game. If > something can be tied into existing imagery (even if only subtly so) and be > enhanced by or play off of pre-existing feelings and conceptions within the > player, why throw away that extra bit of power at your disposal?\\" Later in the interview, Maldonado explained how the world of Torn came about: > \\"I was given a set of directives by Feargus Urquhart, Black Isle Studios' > division head. He was clear that he would encourage the sort of mature, > gritty setting that we used in Fallout or Planescape: Torment, but didn't > want a world that was simply \\"covered in darkness\\"... there should places of > light, darkness, and a whole lot o' gray in between. He also wanted some > sort of clear, conflict that influenced all things on some level but didn't > simply overpower everything. We decided on Order vs. Chaos as it's far less > black and white than Good vs. Evil... after all, agents of Order or Chaos > could potentially use any means at their disposal to bring about the rise of > their cause, meaning that either side has its share of goodies and baddies.\\" To this end, the game's plot was to contain a splinter group of Order followers who would scheme to destroy the entire world, in order to re-create it as a new, unblemished one, so as to achieve \\"ultimate order.\\" Torn's primary narrative revolved around a wandering protagonist character, cursed to bring pain and misfortune wherever he or she traveled, and to whomever he or she traveled with. A misguided king, later revealed to be the game's ultimate antagonist, would have acted as the player's benefactor, assigning them various quests in order to discover the truth about a series of apparently conflicting prophecies. It would eventually have been revealed that all the prophecies, and even the protagonist character's mysterious curse, could be rationalized, and were in fact related to the protagonist character, effectively granting the player control over which interpretation of the future was realized. Development Announced during GDC 2001, Torn was subject to much interest by the press, because the team behind the cult classic Planescape: Torment was revealed to be developing it, and the game itself was to use the much-praised SPECIAL system. According to lead designer David Maldonado, the game had been in development for \\"about fourteen months\\" before its announcement. Torn made a playable showing at E3 2001. Although the preview was an early build of the game with several graphical features disabled, it was generally well received. However, the division director of Black Isle Studios, Feargus Urquhart, later stated that the switch from the LithTech 2.3 engine to the upgraded 3.0 version shortly before the E3 presentation had \\"significant ramifications\\", and the amount of changing and recoding necessitated by the switch caused the game's E3 showing to suffer. In July 2001, after circulation of rumors, Torn was officially cancelled. Following the incident, five members of Black Isle Studios' staff were laid off. The ultimate reason for Torn's cancellation was eventually revealed by Feargus Urquhart: > \\"I don't know if we ever released an official reason on why [Torn] was > canceled, but in a nutshell, the game was canceled because it was not going > to be done in time to get Interplay the revenue the company needed to > continue operations. That sounds like it was all Interplay's fault, but > that's really not the case. The project was not going well and continued to > be an ongoing challenge.\\" Notes External links *Torn at Black Isle Studios' official site, pre- cancellation - accessed through archive.org *GameSpot special feature on Torn, post cancellation *IGN pre-cancellation preview of Torn *Torn at FalloutWiki Role-playing video games Cancelled Windows games Black Isle Studios games ","title":"Black Isle's Torn"},{"id":"4979818","text":"Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant (, abbreviated , ) also known as CTZ-Uraltrak (–ß–¢–ó- –£–†–ê–õ–¢–†–ê–ö) is a tractor plant in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. History ChTZ in the 1930s The Chelyabinsk Tractor plant was a project of the first five-year plan. The plant was founded in 1933; the first product was a 60 hp tracked tractor C-60 (–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–µ—Ü-60, Stalinets-60) fueled by petroleum ether (Benzine). In 1937 the factory produced its first diesel-powered vehicle C-65 (–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–µ—Ü-65, Stalinets-65). By 1940 the plant had produced 100,000 tractors. During World War II seven other industrial entities (including most of Leningrad's Kirov Plant and 15,000 of its workers) were either wholly or partially relocated to Chelyabinsk, the resulting enterprise commonly known as \\"–¢–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥\\" ('Tankograd', or 'Tank City'). The work force increased to 60,000 workers by 1944, from 25,000 during non-military production; during the conflict the works produced 18,000 tanks, and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition. Production included the KV tank from 1941, T-34 tank from 1942, KV-85 tank and IS tanks from 1943, and T-34/85 tank and SU-85 self-propelled field gun from 1944 By 1945 the plant had been awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 1st Class, the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Star, and other honours for its efforts in helping to defeat Nazi Germany. Post World War II conventional tractor production resumed with the –°-80 (–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–µ—Ü-80, Stalinets-80) entering serial production in 1946. The plant reverted to its original name of Chelyabinsk Tractor factory in 1958. In 1961 a tractor with diesel electric transmission entered production: DET-250 (–î–≠–¢-250). The millionth tractor from CTZ was produced in 1984. In 1990 a tractor with a hydromechanical transmission system entered production (T-10). In 2008 the company acquired 100% of amphibious tracked machine building company \\"Vityaz\\" (–í–∏—Ç—è–∑—å); both are now part of the Uralvagonzavod holding group which Uraltrak established in association with other companies.

Early life and career  Henning Holck-Larsen was educated at the University of Copenhagen (and what is now the Technical University of Denmark). He came to India in 1937 as a chemical engineer working for F. L. Smidth & Co. of Copenhagen. Partnering with his former schoolmate and fellow employee S√∏ren Kristian Toubro, he set up Larsen & Toubro in 1938. The idea of L&T; was conceived during a holiday in Matheran, a hill station near Bombay. Holck-Larsen was a risk-taker while Toubro was more conservative. Larsen and Toubro saw opportunities in India at time, when few Europeans had realised the country's potential for industrial growth. The first office of L&T;, located in Bombay, was so small that only one of them could use it a time. Initially, L&T; represented Danish dairy equipment manufacturers. However, the Danish imports were restricted during the World War II, forcing L&T; to start a small workshop that provided servicing and undertook small jobs. The imports stopped after the German invasion of Denmark, forcing L&T; to start manufacturing dairy equipment indigenously, a move that was successful. Seeing opportunity in ship repair during wartime, Larsen and Toubro formed a new company called Hilda Ltd. Around this time, L&T; also started two repair and fabrication shops. The internment of German engineers who were supposed to build a soda ash plant for the Tatas provided L&T; another new opportunity. In 1944, Larsen and Toubro established Engineering Construction & Contracts (ECC). L&T; started collaborating with international companies around this time. In 1945, it signed an agreement with the Caterpillar Tractor Company of USA for marketing earthmoving equipment. L&T; also started representing British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture a variety of products including biscuits, glass, hydrogenated oils and soaps. At the end of the World War II, the war-surplus Caterpillar equipment were available in bulk at low prices. However, L&T; lacked the money to purchase them. Therefore, Larsen and Toubro decided to raise additional equity capital, and as a result, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was established on 7 February 1946. After India gained independence in 1947, L&T; set up offices in Calcutta, Madras and New Delhi. Larsen and Toubro gradually transformed L&T; into a large business house with diverse interests, and went on to become one of the most successful Indian companies. After retirement, Holck-Larsen served as the chairman emeritus of the company. He used to call India his \\"adopted homeland\\" and divided his time between Denmark and India. He died in 2003 at the Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai.

The film co-stars Nicole Kidman, Steven Hill, Steve Buscemi, and Bruce Willis. Although Billy is a fictional character, at least four of the other characters in the film were real people from New York of the 1930s. The screenplay was adapted by British writer Tom Stoppard from E.L. Doctorow's 1989 novel of the same name. However, Doctorow distanced himself from the film for the extensive deviations from the book. It received mixed to negative reviews and was a box office bomb, grossing a mere $15.5 million against its $48 million budget. Plot Billy Behan is a poor teenage boy from the Bronx. One day he catches the attention of gangster Dutch Schultz. Changing his last name to Bathgate, after a local street, he goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a gopher for Schultz. Billy is present when Schultz murders his former partner Bo Weinberg, who Schultz believes betrayed him. Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston. Facing legal charges in a court in upstate New York, Schultz brings Billy and Drew along. He successfully charms the locals, presenting himself as charming and good natured. While his boss Dutch stands trial, Billy's job is to watch over Drew. His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew. Realizing that Drew is about to be killed, Billy calls her husband, who hurries to town and takes her home before Schultz's men can make their move. Having beaten the rap in court, Dutch is indicted again on federal tax evasion charges. He wants to have federal prosecutor Thomas Dewey murdered, but his request is rejected by the Mafia Commission. Schultz sends Billy to another gangster with some bribe money, but the effort is rejected. When Billy returns with the bad news, he and Schultz have a falling out and Billy is fired by Schultz's associate Otto, who lets him keep the bribe money as a severance package. As Billy leaves, he is abducted and beaten by gangsters working for Lucky Luciano. The men storm Dutch's hideout and kill everyone inside. Billy is taken before Luciano, who warns him that he knows where Billy's family lives, before letting him go.

Packages bearing this mark contain hazardous material in a limited quantity that presents a limited hazard during transportation, due to its form, quantity, and packaging. Consumer commodity is a hazardous material that is packaged and distributed in a quantity and form intended or suitable for retail sale and designed for consumption by individuals for their personal care or household use purposes. This term can also include certain drugs or medicines. Examples of items classed ORM-D include: * Aerosol cans * Charcoal * Drain cleaners * Lighters * Nitromethane fuel * Perfumes * Small arms ammunitionCode of Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 172.101 (not shipped as Consumer Commodity)Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 173.63 * Soldering flux * Some photographic chemicals The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 49The Code Of Federal Regulations Title 49 Transportation Part 171.8 defines a Consumer Commodity and those items with exceptions provided in the 172.101 table, of limited quantity, and conforming to the definition of \\"Consumer Commodity\\" may be marked and sent ORM-D. There are weight and volume restrictions for all ORM-D packages which vary by hazard class. For example, a gallon of a Class 3 flammable liquid PGII cannot be reclassified as ORM-D because it exceeds the limited quantity volume. However, a gallon of a Class 6, PGIII material is within the volume criteria for a Limited Quantity. That gallon can then be labeled as an ORM-D if it meets the definition of a substance that can be converted from a Limited Quantity to an ORM-D. It is impossible to have an ORM-D that does not fit the criteria for a Limited Quantity. First an item is determined to be a Limited Quantity, and then it is determined if it can be reclassified further to become an ORM-D. If the item is able to be reclassified as ORM-D the proper shipping name is usually, but not always, \\"Consumer Commodity\\" as found in the 172.101 table. Other proper shipping names used for ORM-D material are Cartridges Small Arms and Cartridges Power Device. These products will no longer fall under one of the 9 hazard classes either, its \\"Hazard Class or Division\\" is now defined as \\"ORM-D\\". Material marked \\"ORM-D\\" and shipped by surface transportation does not require hazardous shipping papers, simply an ORM-D and proper shipping name marking on the box. This marking can either be in the form of an ORM-D sticker, or written by hand. If written by hand the letters \\"ORM-D\\" must be enclosed by a rectangle. When transported by air, ORM-D shipments require an ORM-D-AIR marking and full hazardous shipping papers. Both UPS Ground and FedEx Ground do not require a hazardous shipping contract to ship ORM-D packages except to Alaska and Hawaii. FedEx Ground does not transport ORM-D packages to Alaska or Hawaii. The United States Postal Service will accept ORM-D packages only for materials intended for domestic surface transportation. Its use is prohibited in international mail. , FedEx Ground will no longer accept shipments labeled as ORM-D, Consumer Commodity, however these same materials can still be shipped using a different label.

TDF Theatre Dictionary. Retrieved 2014-10-08. At this point in the rehearsal progress, it is expected that the creative aspects of the production are ready. Actors have their lines memorized; lights, sound, scenery, and costumes are fully designed and completely constructed. If the production is a musical, then the pit orchestra has rehearsed the music completely, and any dancers are prepared with their choreography memorized. During technical week all of the various technical elements are fully implemented, making the rehearsals very similar to the actual performance. The purpose of tech week is to rehearse the show with all technical elements in place. This allows the actors to become familiar with the set and costumes, the technical production crew to iron out unforeseen problems, and the director to see how everything comes together as an artistic whole. Tech week is when practical problems with the implementation of production elements are discovered. For example, an actor may report that their costume restricts their movement or that a hand prop is overly cumbersome. A set door that performed fine the week before may bang shut too loudly now that there are live microphones on the stage. The first few rehearsals are characterized by the frequent stopping and starting of scenes so that the technical crew can practice their necessary duties (such as executing their cues or scene changes correctly).Sykes, Kimberley. \\"Rehearsal Diary - Tech Week\\".

The temple is located in the southern region of the Indian Peninsula, in Panachikkad in Kottayam, Kerala, India. It is one of the most prominent Saraswati temples in Kerala. But, the main deity of the temple is Lord Vishnu, who was installed long before Goddess Saraswati. Still the temple is known as Saraswati temple, due to the popularity of the Goddess. There are sub-shrines for Lord Shiva, Lord Ganapathi, Lord Ayyappan, snake deities and Yakshi inside the temple. Legend Panachikkadu temple Kottarathil Sankunni's Aithihyamala has a detailed description of the temple, which has more than a thousand years of history. Nambudiri Kizhapuram Illam had no male heirs to carry out the rites. He was about 60 years of age and had lost all hope of having a son. He set off to Varanasi to take a bath in the holy River Ganges. On the way, he stopped at Mookambika and stayed there for a few days and prayed to his deity. The serenity of the place enamored him and he decided to chant bhajans there for a year. After spending a year in the temple, the old man dreamed of a beautiful woman who appeared and told him that it was impossible for him to have a child in this life, and told him that it would be better for him to go back to his home and adopt a child from a family Karunattu nearby. The woman of that family would be destined to have two children in the near future. The old man accepted his fate and returned to his homeland. Upon reaching Panachikkadu, he decided to take a bath in the temple pond. He put his Olakuda, an umbrella made of palm leaves, on the southern side of the temple and went to bathe. After the bath, he tried to pick up his umbrella, but he couldn't. The Nambudiri stood puzzled. Then a man magically materialized and explained to the Nambudiri that the Goddess Mookambika Devi was staying in the umbrella and that the Nambudiri would have to transfer the divinity to an idol before he could retrieve the umbrella. He also told the Nambudiri that an idol suitable for transfer was lying hidden in the nearby forest. He warned him that he would have to appease its protector, a Yakshi, before taking the idol. The Nambudiri did as he was told and the Goddess Panachikkadu Devi was established as the deity of the place. Another smaller idol was placed facing west as Archana Bimbam. The idol was erected in a low terrain filled with water without a roof, making it seem as if the Devi was seated in the middle of a pond. The main idol is now covered with creepers and shrubs and is not clearly visible. The leaves of the creepers are considered Saraswati leaves. The spring water flows continuously until it touches the feet of the Devi. This water never dries, not even in the peak time of summer. Since the Devi remains on such a saras (small rivulet), the Goddess is called Saraswati. The water required for pooja and other needs is drawn from the spring. No other water sources seem to exist. Surroundings Above the Saraswati temple on the western side, there is a natural habitat made of exotic plants and their fragrant flowers. There lives the Yakshi, who is at once fastidious and easily made happy. The idol of a Brahmarakshas is also installed there. Even though there are Yakshi shrines in other temples, the power of the Yakshi at Panachikkadu is supposed to be more manifested. The idol of Yakshi has no structure to cover it. It is installed under the trees like Elinji and Ezhilam Pala. The trusteeship of the shrine is vested with Kizhapuram, Karunattu and Kaimukku Nambudiri Illams. They are the residents of Panachikkadu. The boys of the Illams carry out the rites there. Stone carvings on the walls illustrate Lord Vishnu and his servants playing a game similar to modern day Volleyball. This is supposed to be a representation of Vishnu's Preservation of the Universe, as he is seen dominating the opposition. These inscriptions also seem to suggest that India, and not USA, might have been the birthplace of the game. The major festival this temple hosts is the Saraswati Pooja in the month of Thulam [A month in the Malayalam calendar known as Kollavarsham (Kolla era)] which falls approximately in September‚ÄìOctober)]. During this festival, also known as Navaratri (Nine Nights), a large number of pilgrims congregate here to pay homage to the deity. From various parts of India, devotees come here for Darshan, and religious people come here for Vidyarambham (the formal initiation of education with the introduction of alphabets). The ceremony of Vidyarambham is held on Vijayadashami (last day of Navarathri). On the day of ceremony, quite a number of people arrive at this temple to initiate the education of their children. A major international cultural festival of classical dance and music is also held in the temple for the duration of the nine nights of the Navarathri festival. Panachikkadu can be reached from Chingavanam (4 km) by travelling through MC Road and from Eravinalloor (2.5 km).

Described by Peter Quennell as \\"One of the most remarkable books of its kind ever published in the English Language\\", Hickey's Memoirs give an extraordinarily vivid picture of life in late 18th-century London, Calcutta, Madras and Jamaica which stands comparison with the best of his near-contemporary James Boswell. Early life 1749‚Äì1769 Hickey was born in St. Albans Street, Pall Mall, Westminster, England, on 30 June 1749, the seventh son of Joseph Hickey, a successful Irish solicitor, and Mary Boulton, from a Yorkshire gentry family. He began his education at Westminster School, but was removed \\"in high disgrace\\" in December 1763 after neglecting his studies, frequenting public houses and leading, in his own words, a life of \\"idleness and dissipation\\". Instead he was sent to a private school at Streatham in Surrey, where he was able to study Arithmetic, Writing, French, Drawing and Dancing in addition to the Classical Studies which had failed to engage him at Westminster. In January 1766 he left school and began his legal training, but he continued to lead an extremely debauched existence. He refers in his memoirs to many of his youthful sexual experiences, beginning with a girl called Nanny Harris, a servant of his father's. He had many indiscretions in London, where he lived well beyond his means. Eventually he embezzled ¬£500 from the accounts in his father's office, and when this was discovered it was resolved to send the prodigal to India to see if he could make good. Accordingly, Hickey embarked on the ship Plassey, a fast Indiaman, at Dungeness on 4 January 1769. India and Jamaica Thomas Hickey's painting An Indian Lady (Indian bibi Jemdanee), believed to depict William's Bengali partner Jemdanee, 1787, National Gallery of Ireland, DublinHermione De Almeida, George H. Gilpin, Indian Renaissance: British Romantic Art and the Prospect of India, Ashgate Publishing, 2005, p. 85. Upon arriving in India, Hickey was expected to join the British East India Company army as an officer cadet, but he was put off the prospect when he learned that the pay was \\"too contemptible to afford the common necessaries of life\\". He got back on the Plassey to return to England. The ship travelled on first to China, of which he gives an account in his memoirs. His father was less than pleased at his return. After Hickey reverted to his old ways, his father sent him to Jamaica to take up as a lawyer, with a warning that if he failed he could expect no further help -- indeed, his father would no longer even receive him. Once in Jamaica he found that, because of limits imposed on the numbers of attorneys allowed to practice, he would not be able to make a living as a lawyer there. He returned to England, \\"with considerable regret\\", leaving about five months after his arrival, on 17 April 1776, arriving back on 14 June. Through his various connections, including Edmund Burke, he arranged to be accepted as a lawyer in Bengal, a feat which restored his father's goodwill towards him. He departed for Bengal from Portsmouth on 1 May 1777 and called in, en route, at Cape Town. On 12 November 1777 Hickey, aged 28, was \\"entered on the Roll\\" as \\"Solicitor, Attorney, and Proctor of the Supreme Court\\" in Bengal. He prospered in those roles. In April 1779 he set out to return to England, charged by the English inhabitants of Calcutta to deliver, at their expense, a petition to Parliament in England that they should be entitled to trial by jury. After a difficult journey travelling via Cape Town and Holland he arrived back in England, at the port of Harwich, on 28 June 1780. In October he first met and later took up with a demi-mondaine called Charlotte Barry, who was then aged 18 and with whom he fell in love. He offered to marry her; she refused marriage, but agreed to live with him as his partner. The couple then travelled together to India when Hickey was 32 in 1783. Charlotte did not survive long, dying the year after they arrivedDecember 25th, 1783; tombstone 1495, Old English Cemetery, Park Street, Kolkata. Tombstone of Charlotte Hickey, born Barry, first wife of William Hickey (1749‚Äì183), on Old English Cemetery, Park Street, Kolkata (tombstone #1495)Hickey established himself in the legal profession, managing to obtain a series of lucrative posts, including Under-Sheriff and Clerk to the Chief Justice. Some while after Charlotte's death he took an Indian mistress, Jemdanee, who was locally considered to be his wife. She bore him a son in 1796, but died in childbirth. The couple's son died a few months after her. Retirement Hickey retired to the Buckinghamshire town of Beaconsfield in late 1808, having left India after becoming ill. He brought with him \\"a pair of elderly unmarried sisters, his favourite Indian servant Munnoo and a large parti-coloured English dog.\\"Peter Quennell (ed), The Prodigal Rake: Memoirs of William Hickey, Dutton, New York, 1962, pp. 9‚Äì18 The dullness of what he called a \\"trifling\\" place \\"with a very limited society\\", encouraged him to occupy his mind by writing his memoirs, which eventually extended to over 700 pages of handwritten text taking his life up to 1810, at which point he stopped. The details of his life after 1810 are sketchy, but he seems to have moved to London with his sisters, Sarah and Ann, who died in 1824 and 1826 respectively. He died in 1830.

It was created in 1928 to drain the rice paddies and swamps which would eventually become Waikiki. It also serves as a primary drainage corridor for the rivers and streams that run through central and east Honolulu. The canal runs from just northwest of Kapahulu Avenue along the length of Waikiki, then turns southwest to empty into the Pacific Ocean. Bridges cross the canal at McCully Street, KalƒÅkaua Avenue, and Ala Moana Boulevard. Ala Wai Boulevard runs parallel to the west side of the canal in Waikiki. History Kalakaua Avenue bridge over the Ala Wai Before the canal existed, Waikiki consisted of wetlands which were fed by streams running from the Makiki, Palolo, and Manoa valleys to the sea. In the early 1900s, Lucius Pinkham, then President of the Territorial Board of Health, proposed to construct a drainage canal to drain the wetlands, which he considered \\"unsanitary.\\" Although the canal proposal was approved by the Board of Health, final approval did not occur until Pinkham became Governor of Hawaii. Construction of the canal by Walter F. Dillingham's Hawaiian Dredging Construction Company, began in 1921 and was completed in 1928. When the city was issuing permits for new buildings in Waikiki they required builders to build above sea level. Dillingham sold the spoil he had dredged in creating the canal so builders could increase the elevation of the newly-created land. The canal is routinely dredged to this day. The creation of the canal shunted the flow of the streams directly into the ocean, which resulted in the creation of several square miles of new real estate. Among those who benefited from the development were people who, though of modest means, had obtained and maintained small rice and bean farms. The reclamation of these lands were considered pivotal in the eventual development of Waikiki as a tourist center. As originally designed, the canal's two-mile long waterway had two outlets, one on either end, which allowed sediment to be flushed into the ocean. Engineers decided not to build the eastern outlet, near Kapiolani Park and the Waikiki Natatorium when they determined that contamination from that end would be deposited on the beach at Waikiki. Major concerns The bank of the Ala Wai One major concern raised by federal flood experts is that heavy rain could cause the canal to overflow, potentially inundating the area from Diamond Head to Ala Moana and Moiliili with up to five feet of water. To prevent such a disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has examined various measures, including digging a deeper channel, widening the McCully bridge, and adding walls along the canal. Another major issue is the pollution in the canal brought about by urbanization. In addition to runoff from streets and growing neighborhoods, mercury was detected in the canal. The mercury was attributed to the boat paint used in the Ala Wai Harbor. A 1976 Department of Health report also said that canal water regularly violated federal limits on fecal coliform counts, an indicator of high bacteria levels. The canal has been dredged at least three times, in 1967, 1978 and 2002. Most of the dredged sediment was deposited in the ocean, except for some sediment from the 2002 dredging, which was deemed too toxic and instead used for landfill at Honolulu International Airport. In March 2006, heavy thunderstorms and rains overwhelmed the sewers around the Ala Wai Canal, causing a pressurized sewage line to break. Days later, and after the spill was made public, then Mayor Mufi Hannemann decided to divert nearly of untreated sewage into the Ala Wai Canal in an attempt to avoid having the sewage back up into hotels and residences. This diversion caused partial overflowing of the canal in some areas, and the sewage then tainted Waikiki and nearby beaches. The beaches near the Ala Wai Canal, including beaches in the Waikiki and Ala Moana districts were closed temporarily due to health concerns. In the weeks after the incident, beaches were eventually reopened, but it took several months before the Ala Wai Canal was determined to be safe and free from major health concerns. One person died from septic shock after falling into the Ala Wai Harbor near the mouth of the canal, with his death being attributed by some to the higher levels of bacteria present after the flood. Despite the canal repeatedly falling short of meeting safety standards for paddling and recreational use, there has been no move to prohibit such use. Hundreds of paddlers and boaters make it one of the most used inland waterways in the state.

He was accepted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1999. Family Born in 1849 into a Protestant family at Herimoncourt, in eastern France, Armand Peugeot was the son of Emile Peugeot and grandson of Jean-Pierre Peugeot. The family had a metal working business, producing a range of practical goods such as springs, saws, spectacle frames and coffee grinders. In 1872 he married Sophie Leonie Fallot (1852-1930) and they had five children, but their only son, Raymond, died in 1896. Armand Peugeot died on 2 January 1915 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. He was a great great grandson of Jean-Pierre Peugeot. Education He was a graduate of the √âcole Centrale Paris, a prestigious engineering school in France. In 1881, Armand travelled to England where he saw the potential of bicycles and their manufacture. Business From 1865, Armand and his second cousin Eug√®ne became involved with the running of the company, then called Peugeot Fr√®res A√Æn√©s. They took it into cycle manufacture in 1882, and exhibited a steam-powered tricycle at the 1889 World Fair in Paris. They created their first car in their workhouse which is located in eastern France. By 1892, the company name was Les Fils de Peugeot Fr√®res, and they had begun to manufacture cars with Daimler engines. Armand wanted to increase production, but Eug√®ne did not want to commit the company to the necessary investment. So, on 2 April 1896, Armand set up his own company, Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Automobiles Peugeot. He built a factory at Audincourt, dedicated to the manufacture of cars with an internal combustion engine. In February 1910, without a male heir, he agreed to merge his company with Eug√®ne‚Äôs. When he stepped down from managing the company in 1913, Peugeot were the largest car manufacturer in France, producing 10,000 cars per year.

It is from , situated at the confluence of the River Avon and River Trym and near the A4 Bristol Portway. Its three letter station code is SML. The station has a single platform which serves trains in both directions. it is managed by Great Western Railway, which is the third franchise to be responsible for the station since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every forty minutes in each direction between and . The station was opened in 1865 by the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, and had a single platform. It later became part of the Clifton Extension Railway, and had a second platform built. The station was expanded over the years, and at one point had four porters staffing it. However the Severn Beach Line declined over the latter half of the twentieth century and by the 1970s the station had no staff and only one platform. Services however have increased since 2000.  Description  The station is located in the Sea Mills area of Bristol, and additionally serves residents of Stoke Bishop. The surrounding area is mostly residential, with allotments to the west and a small football ground to the north. The station is less than from the River Avon to the west, and directly south of a small harbour at the mouth of the River Trym, which the railway crosses on a bridge. The station has road access to the east from Sea Mills Lane, which runs parallel to the Trym, and can also be accessed via a footpath along the Avon to the west. The A4 Bristol Portway is less than east of the station, and crosses the railway south of the station. The station is on the Severn Beach Line from to , from Temple Meads and from Severn Beach.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. It is the sixth station from Temple Meads. The next station towards Temple Meads is ; the next towards Severn Beach is . The station is on an alignment of approximately 160 degrees, curving towards the south. There is a single -long platform which serves trains in both directions, situated on the east side of the track. The station's western platform was abandoned in 1970 and is overgrown. A user- worked level crossing at the north end of the station allows vehicles and pedestrians to cross the railway, alternatively pedestrians may cross the line using a footpath which goes under the bridge over the River Trym. Facilities at the station are minimal ‚Äì there is a brick shelter and a few seats. Timetable information is provided; help points show next train information and allow users to contact railway staff. There is no ticket office or other means for buying or collecting tickets, nor is there any car park or cycle storage facility. The nearest bus stops are away on the A4 Portway. The line through Sea Mills has a speed limit of for locomotive-hauled trains and for diesel multiple units. The line handles less than 5 million train tonnes per year, has a loading gauge of W6 and a route availability of 7. , approximately 58,000 passengers used Sea Mills station, making it the 1,863rd busiest station in the country and the tenth busiest within the Bristol unitary authority area. This was an increase of almost 70% from the 2002-03 financial year, and reflected a general rise in usage of the Severn Beach Line.Annual estimated passenger usage based on sales of tickets in stated financial year(s) which end or originate at Sea Mills, from Office of Rail and Road statistics. Methodology may vary year on year.  Services  Services at Sea Mills are all operated by Great Western Railway, using mainly diesel Turbo units. On Monday to Friday, three trains every two hours run from to , with one extended to and , giving a service at Sea Mills of one train in each direction every 40 minutes. Most services start at Bristol, but one evening service to Avonmouth begins at . On Saturdays there is a similar level of service, but more trains continue to Severn Beach. Sunday sees a roughly hourly service to and from Bristol, with only two services extending to Severn Beach, except during the May‚ÄìSeptember timetable period when all services are extended. The first and last Sunday trains towards Bristol are extended to via , and there are similar workings in the other direction. As Clifton Down is the Severn Beach Line's passing point, trains to Avonmouth usually arrive roughly ten minutes after trains to Bristol. Most trains call at all stations, but some services omit . The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is roughly 25 minutes, and 10 minutes to Avonmouth. In 2012, the single fare to Clifton Down or Severn Beach was ¬£1.50, and ¬£3 return for the whole line.  History  The station building was constructed in 1906, but is now a private property unconnected to the railway. The station was opened on 6 March 1865 when services began on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier (BPRP), a self- contained railway which ran along the north bank of the River Avon to a deep water pier on the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. The route was standard gauge single track, with Sea Mills initially the first station along the line, from the southern terminus at . A single -long uncovered platform was provided on the north side of the line, with a wooden building containing the booking office and porter's office. The station staff consisted of a stationmaster with a porter being brought in from Hotwells when needed. A south-facing goods siding was provided, but the station mostly dealt with passengers and parcels. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction. The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871 when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build-up of silt. With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network, the Clifton Extension Railway (CER) was approved. This was a joint venture by the BPRP, Great Western Railway and Midland Railway which ran from Sneyd Park Junction, south of Sea Mills, via , to join up with the national network at Narroways Hill Junction. The link opened in 1877, but only for goods trains: Colonel William Yolland, the chief inspector of British railways, considered the platforms at Sea Mills to be too short for passenger interchange, as they were shorter than at any station on the CER. Rather than build a new interchange station at Sneyd Park Junction, the platforms at Sea Mills were extended to at the expense of the BPRP. The goods siding was also removed at this time, as Yolland had expressed concern that the points were not interlocked. The route from Sneyd Park Junction to Clifton Down was subsequently cleared for passenger use on 3 August 1878, but the Midland and Great Western Railways did not think the BPRP track was in a suitable condition and so refused to run any passenger trains beyond Clifton Down. Services along the BPRP however increased to eight trains per day in each direction from 1877, and then to ten each way by 1887. From 1 September 1885, when passenger services along the link finally started, the Great Western offered six trains per day each direction between and . Fearing competition, the BPRP did not allow passengers to use GWR services between its stations. The Midland Railway did not run any passenger services beyond Clifton Down, apart from a one-month trial service in September 1885. Despite the increased traffic, the BPRP suffered financially, and was taken over by the CER in 1890. A train towards passes through Sea Mills circa 1963. The platform this train is using would be taken out of use in 1970. Following the takeover, a new stationmaster's house was built at Sea Mills, at a cost of ¬£240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 to the west of the tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays. After the First World War, construction of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated the closure of the line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily towards Bristol and six toward Avonmouth. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. From 1928 many trains to Avonmouth were extended to . By 1947, just before the railways were nationalised, there were 33 services each direction between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, with 18 on Sundays. Some trains made circular trips to and from Temple Meads via Clifton Down and or . A First Great Western Pacer DMU calls at Sea Mills with a train for in 2008. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Sea Mills came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staffing by this point had increased to two porters and two lad porters, managed by the stationmaster at . By 1961 this was reduced to two porters, then to one in 1965. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Sea Mills, with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, eastern platform. The station building was sold, and in 2005 was being used by an engineering firm. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Sea Mills passed to Regional Railways. At this time, all trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times, but northbound services were terminated at Avonmouth. There was no Sunday service. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway (FOSBR) and a string of protests, services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line, and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours (24 trains per day). Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010.  Future  A First Great Western Sprinter DMU calls at Sea Mills with a train for in 2014. Trains such as these displaced the Pacer DMUs which had previously operated the line. First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Sea Mills are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines, so Sea Mills will continue to be served by diesel trains, with the current \\"Sprinter\\" units expected to be replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line. Improved services at Sea Mills are called for as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, with trains towards Bristol terminating alternately at and , however due to the large sections of the Severn Beach Line which are single-track and to the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. The enhancement scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There are also calls for the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line, which could allow a direct service from Sea Mills to via . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, however Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion. There are also calls for the second platform at Sea Mills to be reinstated as a passing loop or as part of a restoration of the whole line to double track.

Best known for establishing unjust enrichment as a branch of English law, he has been described by Andrew Burrows as \\"the greatest judge of modern times\\". Goff was the original co-author of Goff & Jones, the leading English law textbook on restitution and unjust enrichment, first published in 1966. He practised as a commercial barrister from 1951 to 1975, following which he began his career as a judge. He was appointed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords in 1986. Goff was born in his mother's family home in Perthshire, Scotland and was raised in Hampshire, England. He obtained a place at New College, Oxford but was called up in December 1944 and served in the Scots Guards in Italy until going to Oxford in October 1948. He earned a first-class degree in Jurisprudence there, and three weeks after receiving his examination results was offered a fellowship at Oxford. He accepted this on condition that he could be called to the Bar first. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1951, and appointed Fellow and Tutor at Lincoln College, Oxford and a University Lecturer in Jurisprudence in 1952. He was High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1991 to 2001. As one of the few early academics-turned-judges, Goff long advocated a complementary view of the role of the legal academic and judge. In this respect, the former Lord Justice of Appeal Sir Stephen Tomlinson said that \\"no judge has done more than Robert to ensure that the views of legal academic commentators now regularly inform the decision-making in our higher courts\\". Towards the later part of his life, he developed an interest in sharing perspectives with foreign lawyers and judges. For building bridges between judges in the United Kingdom and Germany, Goff was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (First Class). Early life and education Robert Goff was born in Perthshire, Scotland, on 12 November 1926, as the second child and only son of Lionel Trevor Goff (1877‚Äì1953) and Isobel Jane Higgon (n√©e Denroche-Smith). Lionel studied at Eton College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1897. As a young officer, Lionel fought in the Second Boer War, was wounded in the Siege of Ladysmith and mentioned in dispatches. He also served in the First World War, was wounded in 1917 and again mentioned in dispatches. He remained hospitalised for his wounds until 1921. In 1923, he married Isabel Higgon, n√©e Denroche-Smith, a widow of Archie Higgon, who had been killed in action in 1915. Isobel's family home was near Alyth, North Perthshire, and her father had been a civil servant in Bengal. Robert was brought up at the Goff home in Monk Sherborne, Hampshire. He had a closer relationship with his mother than his father. Lionel's principal interests were in fishing, hunting, shooting and riding, and he did not share his son's passion for music. Likewise, Robert did not share his father's interests, and gave up shooting after he turned eighteen. Goff attended a dame school in Basingstoke until he was eight. Thereafter, he attended St Aubyns School, Rottingdean, and started at Eton College in September 1939, at the beginning of the Second World War. While at Eton, he focused on classical languages and history, preferring these to science subjects. There, Dr Henry Lee, an organist who had played at the coronation of King George VI, encouraged his love for the piano and taught him to play. He left Eton in December 1944, having received a deferred offer of admission to New College, Oxford, for after he completed his military service. = Military service = In December 1944, Goff was called up and commissioned into the Scots Guards. He trained for battle in the Far East, having been told that he would be deployed there in September 1945. Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945, these plans were cancelled. Instead, Goff spent some time on guard duty at Windsor Castle, and then volunteered to serve in the force being sent to Italy to counter Marshal Tito, where he remained until July 1948. During this period, he spent his leave travelling and exploring northern Italy, skiing, and pursuing cultural interests, while introducing the men under his command to them. On occasions, he would combine setting up communications posts with visits with his men to see Italian art, including Michelangelo's David and Piero della Francesca's Polyptych of Perugia. = University education = In 1948, Goff took up his place at Oxford for a two-year \\"shortened\\" Final Honour Schools course for ex-servicemen. Having been given a choice between reading Jurisprudence, Greats or History, he chose Jurisprudence, with the aim of practicing as a barrister after graduating. At New College, his tutors included Jack Butterworth and Wilfrid Bourne. He graduated with a First Class Degree in 1950, having served as Steward of the Junior Common Room.  Career  = Academic career = Although Goff had intended to go straight to the Bar after graduation, these plans changed shortly after his examination results were released. Keith Murray, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, telephoned him to invite him to a meeting. At this meeting, Murray indicated that a fellowship and tutorship in law had become vacant following Harold Hanbury's appointment as Vinerian Professor of English Law, and that he wished to offer it to Goff. Goff, astonished, asked for half an hour to consider the proposal. In apparent surprise that Goff needed to think about the offer, Murray granted the time, following which Goff accepted the offer, on condition that he could first sit the Bar exams and be called to the Bar. Murray agreed to this and Goff was called by Inner Temple in 1951. In October 1951, he began teaching at Lincoln College, and remained there until the end of the 1954‚Äì55 academic year. Alongside his teaching, he served on various committees and briefly as dean in 1952‚Äì53 when the incumbent was on leave. His students included Swinton Thomas, who would become a judge of the Court of Appeal. Aware that he had done a shortened two-year course in law, in which he only studied six subjects in limited depth, Goff did \\"some pretty hectic and thorough preparation for tutorials\\". He taught a range of subjects, including Criminal Law and Roman Law. His schedule was hectic, teaching nearly 50 students in a single year, some of whom required multiple tutorials a week. To share the workload, the College permitted him to recruit a weekender. This role was fulfilled by Pat Neill, who was then a Prize Fellow at All Souls College. He gave joint classes with Tony Honor√©, where it is suggested that he met A. W. B. Simpson, his successor at Lincoln College. When he left full-time academia for the Bar, Sir Walter Oakeshott, Rector of Lincoln College said that \\"there was widespread hope of his being content to go on as an academic lawyer, and by his departure law studies at Oxford, as well as the College, will suffer greatly\\". Goff & Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment In 1952, Goff was appointed to a Common University Fund lectureship in law, to take effect in 1953. In this capacity, he was required to give a series of lectures on any area of interest to him. When exploring texts for inspiration, he chanced upon \\"quasi-contracts\\", a concept traceable to Roman law, but which was at that point unrecognised in English law. Together with Ronald Maudsley, then the law tutor at Brasenose College, he set up a series of seminars in Restitution, also described as \\"Unjustifiable Enrichment\\" and \\"Quasi Contract\\". The lectures were not on the syllabus and not many students attended. They did attract academic attendees, some of whom, like Peter North, went on to be distinguished academic lawyers.436x436pxOn the basis of these lectures, Goff and Maudsley jointly began work on the book that would later become Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution (today published as Goff and Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment). Goff had continued drafting the textbook after leaving academia for the Commercial Bar. At the time, work for junior barristers was limited, and so he spent considerable time working on the book at the Inner Temple library. During this period, Maudsley spent long stretches of time in the United States, and did not respond to Goff's communications. In 1959, Goff was reading a Law Quarterly Review and came across an article written by Maudsley, which he believed to be based heavily on the material they had prepared in their joint lectures. Goff wrote to Maudsley once again, but upon not receiving a reply, concluded that Maudsley \\"was signing off and didn't feel able to tell me\\". As a junior barrister with a growing practice, Goff realised that if his book was to be completed, he would need a collaborator. A. W. B. Simpson introduced him to Gareth Jones, then fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later Downing Professor of the Laws of England, with whom he would eventually publish the book. Goff would later describe Jones as \\"the ideal co-author\\" and \\"beyond doubt, one of the finest teachers in the common law world\\". The book publication took much longer than either Goff or Jones anticipated. The manuscript was submitted in late 1964. The page proofs, which arrived in 1965, had so many mistakes and required so many alterations that the publishers, Sweet & Maxwell, made the authors pay for a second set of proofs. As a result, Goff and Jones made practically no money from the first edition of the book, and Goff complained that Sweet & Maxwell \\"appeared to understand nothing about writing pioneering books\\". The book was finally published in 1966. Upon its release, the book was quickly recognised as a significant work, and was largely favourably reviewed. Lord Denning reflected positively on it, calling it \\"a creative work\\" and comparing it to Sir Frederick Pollock's treatise on torts and the seminal textbook Anson's Law of Contract. Edmund Davies, then a judge of the High Court of Justice, described it as \\"admirable\\".Chesworth v Farrar [1967] 1 QB 407, at p. 417. (\\"It has long been recognised that (as is pointed out in the recently published and admirable Law of Restitution, by Goff and Jones, p. 427) ...\\"). (per Edmund-Davies J) The book's propositions caused some confusion in academic circles. Not knowing where it fitted, a university library classified it as Criminal Law, and a library of one of the Inns of Court refused to take the book in at all. The book's propositions were not unanimously welcomed. For example, they were resisted by Lord Diplock, who as late as in 1977 continued to declare judicially that \\"there is no general doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law\\".Orakpo v Manson Invesments Ltd [1977] AC 95, at p. 104. (\\"My Lords, there is no general doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law. What it does is to provide specific remedies in particular cases of what might be classified as unjust enrichment in a legal system that is based upon the civil law. There are some circumstances in which the remedy takes the form of 'subrogation', but this expression embraces more than a single concept in English law.\\") (per Lord Diplock) Goff submitted the textbook to the University of Oxford for the consideration of a higher degree, and he was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law in 1971. He would later receive honorary degrees from the universities of London, Bristol, Reading, Buckingham and City, University of London. In 1975, Goff was appointed to the High Court. Goff and Jones jointly wrote two further editions of the textbook, which were published in 1978 and 1986, respectively. In the latter year, Goff was appointed to the House of Lords. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1987, and would go on to hold Honorary Fellowships at three Oxford colleges: New, Lincoln, and Wolfson. = Career at the Bar = Goff left academia to join the Commercial Bar in 1955, at a time when the prevailing belief was that there was a sharp difference between the academic lawyer and the practicing lawyer. He joined the chambers of Ashton Roskill QC, then known as 5, King's Bench Walk (but which later amalgamated with 6, King's Bench Walk to form what is today known as 7, King's Bench Walk, or 7KBW). He described his time as a junior barrister as \\"lean\\", because at that time, the bulk of cases went to senior barristers, who tended to have almost permanent junior barristers assisting them. Goff was led by Roskill twice when his usual junior had pneumonia, but was hardly led by anyone else. He took this as an opportunity to teach at Inner Temple and on weekends at Lincoln College, and to continue writing his book on the law of restitution. Goff believed the publication of Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution in 1966 to be one of the reasons he was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) the following year. After this, his practice grew significantly. He appeared in significant and technically difficult commercial cases such as The Mihalis Angelos, and The Brimnes. His choice of junior was Brian Davenport, a close friend whom he described as \\"exceptionally gifted\\", but who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early thirties. Over the course of his practice, he led many juniors, some of whom went on to hold high judicial office, such as Andrew Longmore, Mark Saville, Nick Phillips, and John Hobhouse. Since 2018, 7KBW has commemorated Goff's contributions through the annual The Lords Goff and Hobhouse Memorial Lectures. = Judicial career = In 1974, Goff was appointed Recorder of the Crown Court. In October 1975, after eight years as a QC, Goff was appointed to the High Court, and received the customary knighthood. He spent seven years at the High Court, two of which he spent as the Judge-in-Charge of the Commercial Court. In 1982, he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal and sworn in as a Privy Councillor. On 6 February 1986, Goff was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and a life peer as Baron Goff of Chieveley, of Chieveley in the Royal County of Berkshire. On 1 October 1996, The Lord Keith of Kinkel retired as Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and Goff succeeded him. He retired in 1998, but continued to sit on cases occasionally until his 75th birthday. He was succeeded as Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, and his vacant seat on the House of Lords bench was taken over by his former junior Lord Hobhouse. Over those 12 years, he participated in over 300 cases at the House of Lords and 160 cases at the Privy Council. As an academic-turned-judge, Goff believed that the two professions were different, yet complementary. Upon his appointment to the House of Lords, he was appalled to find poor library and research facilities available, and wrote a paper to the House of Lords authorities, arguing for the provision of a better equipped library for the Law Lords' use. In his Maccabean Lecture to the British Academy in 1983, he described the judge and jurist as on a shared \\"search for principle\\", saying that it was the fusion of their work that led to the development of the common law. Three years after the lecture, he said that \\"it is difficult to overestimate the influence of the jurist in England today\\". In Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd in 1986, Goff used elevated language, describing jurists as ‚Äúpilgrims with [judges] on the endless road to unattainable perfection‚Äù. In 1987, Goff wrote an article titled Judge, Jurist and Legislature, in which he detailed his views on the roles of these players in the legal system. In 1999, he said that he did not know how far he had succeeded in promoting an appropriate recognition of academia's contribution to the development of English law, but that, if he had, \\"that alone will give me great satisfaction.\\" Goff's views influenced others to think about the role of judges and jurists, inspiring the later Lord of Appeal in Ordinary Alan Rodger's first article in 1994, and lectures given by then President of the Supreme Court David Neuberger and Lord Justice of Appeal Jack Beatson. In his obituary, the former Lord Justice of Appeal Stephen Tomlinson said that \\"no judge has done more than Robert to ensure that the views of legal academic commentators now regularly inform the decision-making in our higher courts\\". Goff was a strong believer in the common law as a legal system. This came with a preference for the common law's characteristic incremental development of the law by judges, and a suspicion of codes and legislation, which carried greater weight in civil legal systems. Nevertheless, he supported the work of the Law Commission enthusiastically. This was despite the disapproval of some of his colleagues, according to whom Goff had broken the unspoken rule that no judicial reference was to be made to the work of the Law Commission. In line with his belief in the complementarity of the academic lawyer and judge, he worked to dispel the hostility towards them in the House of Lords. Among the Law Commissioners he supported were his former junior barrister Brian Davenport QC, Jack Beatson and Andrew Burrows. Since then, several Law Commissioners have been appointed to the Supreme Court, marking a significant change in judicial attitudes towards the Law Commission. As Law Lord, he furthered the cause of restitution that he had developed academically. In Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd, he gave judicial recognition to the proposition that unjust enrichment is an independent branch of private law. Graham Virgo, who has disagreed with the reasoning in Lipkin Gorman, nevertheless described it as \\"probably the most important dictum in the modern law of restitution\\". His judgment in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln CC was described by Lord Hoffmann as \\"one of the most distinguished of his luminous contributions to this branch of the law\\" and by Lord Browne- Wilkinson, who dissented, as containing \\"yet another major contribution to the law of restitution\\". Andrew Burrows would later describe him as \\"the greatest judge of modern times\\". Over the course of his judicial career, he presided over a number of other key cases, including:  Leading cases of national significance  * BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2) This case caught national attention as part of the litigation flowing from Libya's nationalisation of its oilfields. Two years after British Petroleum had purchased a half-share of the Sarir oilfield from Nelson Bunker Hunt, Libya nationalised it. British Petroleum claimed that the contract had been frustrated, which would entitle it to compensation under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. The legal historian John Baker described the case as legally complex, \\"involving such vast fortunes that millions of dollars turned upon every nuance of meaning in the 1943 Act\\". Goff presided over the case in the High Court, holding that the contract had been frustrated and that British Petroleum was entitled to damages. Notably, Goff wrote the headnote himself, setting a precedent in law reporting. He also reworked parts of Goff and Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment to accommodate the judgment. * Airedale NHS Trust v Bland Anthony Bland was a 17-year-old Liverpool supporter who had travelled with two friends to Hillsborough Stadium for an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. A fatal human crush occurred, causing Bland serious injury and leaving him in a persistent vegetative state. Goff issued a legal ruling allowing doctors to withdraw his treatment at the request of his family, since there had been no sign of improvement in his condition, there was no reasonable possibility that he would ever emerge from his persistent vegetative state, and was unlikely to survive more than five years. The case provoked significant public discussion over the moral, social and ethical issues of withdrawing life support from an insensate patient. * The Spycatcher case In 1985, former spy Peter Wright attempted to publish Spycatcher, a memoir detailing his work in British intelligence, in violation of the Official Secrets Act 1911. Following the British government's attempts to ban it, it saw a dramatic increase in popularity, selling nearly two million copies worldwide by October 1988. The case in the House of Lords raised important questions relating to the law on breach of confidence, public policy and freedom of expression. * Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd Several hundred people filed a claim against the builders of the skyscraper One Canada Square in the tort of private nuisance, because it interfered with their television signal. The court held, controversially, that the plaintiffs did not have a legal right to television signal. * Re Pinochet (No. 3) A Spanish court requested the extradition of the former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, who was accused of murder, torture and conspiracy to murder. Although Goff had retired by the time this case was heard, he returned on an ad-hoc basis to hear it. The case gained attention because of its implications for the law on immunities and extradition. * Attorney General v Blake This case concerned the MI5 double agent George Blake. Following his escape from prison and flight to the Soviet Union, he wrote a book about his experiences and work in British intelligence, which was published by Jonathan Cape. The government sought to force the publishers to give up all earnings from the sale of the book, arguing that it had harmed the public interest and that the author and publisher should not be allowed to profit from it. Goff joined the majority opinion, ruling in favour of the government. *  Leading cases of legal importance  * Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd * Collins v Wilcock * Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd * Soci√©t√© Nationale Industrielle A√©rospatiale v Lee Kui Jak * Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd * Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc * Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd * White v Jones * Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC * Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd * Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd * Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln CC  Public service and engagement  = Fostering links with foreign jurisdictions = Goff gave many public lectures around the world, partly motivated by his belief that the common law was a uniquely adaptable system which deserved better understanding in civil law jurisdictions. He led judicial exchanges with Germany, France and Italy, in recognition for which he was awarded the Grand Cross (First Class) of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. At the invitation of the Indian jurist and diplomat Laxmi Mall Singhvi, he conducted two three-week lecture tours in India in 1984 and 1986 (the year he was appointed to the House of Lords). These lectures were delivered in four cities. He also delivered the inaugural G S Pathak Memorial Lecture in New Delhi, where he remarked that the difference between Germany and England was that in Germany, \\"the Professor is God, but in England, the Judge is God\\". In 1990, Goff delivered the first of the annual Lord Goff lectures at the City University of Hong Kong. He delivered lectures in Jerusalem, Chicago and Stockholm. = Work with the Inns of Court = When Goff left academia for the Bar, he brought with him a strong interest in the welfare of students and young barristers. At the time, Inner Temple (his Inn of Court) provided almost no educational support. Shortly after moving to the Bar, he and a fellow barrister arranged for lectures to be delivered to Bar students at Inner Temple. Lecturers included Rupert Cross, C. H. S. Fifoot, Peter Carter, R. F. V. Heuston, and Marjorie Reeves (who had been his wife Sarah Cousins's tutor at Oxford). From left to right: Dr Christine Challis, alt= In 1987, when the Inner Temple was going through a time of economic difficulty, Goff was asked by the Treasurer to chair an appeal to boost its Scholarship Fund. This fund evolved into the Pegasus Trust, which supports the exchange of young lawyers in many common law countries, and which was one of Goff's key contributions as a member of Inner Temple. To fund it, Goff assembled a committee of Benchers, including Lord Mackay of Clashfern (Lord Chancellor) and James Callaghan (a former Prime Minister), who was able to secure the support of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust. He entertained John King, then Chairman of British Airways, to lunch, a meeting which resulted in British Airways providing free flights for Pegasus Scholars. According to Stephen Tomlinson, the Pegasus Trust was a \\"valuable and lasting legacy\\", which represented Goff's belief in the importance of linking different jurisdictions, as well as his interest in the welfare of young barristers. It subsequently evolved into a collaborative effort between the four Inns of Court, supporting his belief that the Inns should work more closely. In establishing it, Goff said that: > \\"The common law is one of the greatest forces for good in the world. For > many, the common law means the rule of law and the absolute independence of > the judiciary. It is of paramount importance for the future of the common > law that bridges should be built between the legal professions in the many > countries of the world which live under this system.\\" = Appointments = Goff's other appointments included: * High Steward of the University of Oxford (1991‚Äì2001) * Chairman (1986‚Äì2000) and President (2000‚Äì2008) of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law * President of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (1986‚Äì1991) * Patron of the Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal * Chairman of the Council of Legal Education, which oversaw the teaching and examination of the Bar Final examinations.  Personal life  Goff first met his wife Sarah Cousins in autumn 1952, at a birthday party in Hampshire. She had just graduated from St Anne's College, Oxford, having read History, and was starting a BLitt. They were married in July 1953, and lived in Oxford until 1955, when Goff went to the Bar. As a young academic couple, they became good friends with various academics, including Jack Butterworth, Maurice Platnauer, and Tom Boase. They shared a love for opera, which Goff encouraged in their children. They had four children, one of whom died young. The family lived in London until 1975, and then moved to Chieveley House in Berkshire. Goff was an accomplished pianist; he began his days with a Mozart sonata and spent considerable time transposing and arranging pieces of music for the family collection of instruments. His love of music remained with him into the later years of his life, when his health was failing. He described music as what \\"fed his soul and relaxed him\\". He was particularly fond of the countryside and gardening. Goff was described as giving off a first impression of remoteness, reticence and formidable formality, as a result of his distinction as a lawyer or having inherited a military bearing from his father. He was also described as warm, kind and passionate about his students. In 2004, Goff's health began to decline. In 2006, he and his wife moved from Chieveley House to Cambridge to live near their daughter Juliet, where he remained until his death in 2016.

It is from . Its three letter station code is SHH. The station has a single platform which serves trains in both directions. it is managed by Great Western Railway, which is the third franchise to be responsible for the station since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every forty minutes in each direction between and . The station was opened in 1865 as the headquarters of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a railway which ran along the River Avon from to a pier at Avonmouth, and was linked to the national network in 1877. The station had a single platform to begin with, but was rebuilt with a second in 1903, as well as a signal box and a goods yard. By the 1930s the station had ten staff. The Severn Beach Line declined over the latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. Goods services at Shirehampton ended in 1965, and all staff were withdrawn in 1967. The second platform and signal box were taken out of use in 1970, with the station buildings sold off and later destroyed by fire. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day. Description Avonmouth The station is located in the Shirehampton district of Bristol, a primarily residential area on the north bank of the River Avon near the Severn Estuary. The A4 Bristol Portway is just to the north of the station, with a commercial vehicle hire depot in between. The railway crosses Station Road directly to the west of the station, and is bridged by Hung Road slightly to the east. The station is on the Severn Beach Line from to , from Temple Meads and from Severn Beach.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. It is the seventh station from Temple Meads. The next station towards Temple Meads is ; the next station towards Severn Beach is . The station is on an east-west alignment, curving towards the north. There is a single -long platform which serves trains in both directions, situated on the north side of the track. The station's southern platform was abandoned in 1970 and is overgrown. The station is only accessible via a footpath from the car park on Station Road, which is just off the A4 Portway. Entrance to Shirehampton station Timetable information is provided at the station; help points show next train information and allow users to contact railway staff. There is no ticket office or other means for buying or collecting tickets. There is a car park with 10 spaces on Station Road, as well as stands for four bicycles. The nearest bus stops are on the A4 Portway. The line through Shirehampton has a speed limit of for locomotive-hauled trains and for diesel multiple units. The line, which is not electrified, handles less than 5 million train tonnes per year, has a loading gauge of W6 and a route availability of 7. , approximately 50,000 passengers used Shirehampton station, making it the 1,915th busiest station in the country and the eleventh busiest within the Bristol unitary authority area, busier only than . This was an increase of 34% from the 2002‚Äì03 financial year, and reflected a general rise in usage of the Severn Beach Line.Annual estimated passenger usage based on sales of tickets in stated financial year(s) which end or originate at Shirehampton, from Office of Rail and Road statistics. Methodology may vary year on year. Services Class 165 at Shirehampton with a Bristol service Services at Shirehampton are all operated by Great Western Railway, using mainly diesel Turbo units. On Monday to Friday there are 25 trains per day in each direction: three trains run every two hours between and , with one extended to and , giving a service at Shirehampton of one train in each direction every 40 minutes. Most services start at Bristol, but one evening service to Avonmouth begins at . On Saturdays there is a similar level of service, at 24 trains per day. Sunday sees a roughly hourly service to and from Bristol, ten trains per day, with only two services extending to Severn Beach, except during the May‚ÄìSeptember timetable period when all services are extended. The first and last Sunday trains towards Bristol are extended to via , and there are similar workings in the other direction. Most trains from Shirehampton call at all stations, but some services omit . The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is roughly 30 minutes, and 15 minutes to Severn Beach. In 2012, the single fare to Clifton Down or Severn Beach was ¬£1.50, and ¬£3 return for the whole line. History =Construction and initial operations= The station was opened on 6 March 1865 when services began on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier (BPRP), a self-contained railway which ran along the north bank of the River Avon to a deep water pier on the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. The route was standard gauge single track, with Shirehampton initially the second station along the line, from the southern terminus at . Shirehampton was the BPRP's headquarters, and was the site where construction of the railway began ‚Äì the first sod being turned on 19 February 1863 by the Mayoress of Bristol, Mrs Sholto Vere Hare. The original station was situated at a passing loop, with a single platform on the north side of the line. The building, which is noted as having been architecturally superior to other stations on the line, contained a booking office, porters' rooms, and an office for the line superintendent. The platform was covered along its entire length. A single-road engine shed was sited at the east end of the station from 1875, but burnt down in 1900. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction, however trains did not stop at Shirehampton on Sundays due to opposition from a local church, but this practice ended in May the same year following complaints from other residents and businesses. =Connection to the national network= The Great Western Railway began operating trains from Shirehampton in 1885. The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871 when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build-up of silt. With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network, the Clifton Extension Railway (CER) was approved. This was a joint venture by the BPRP, Great Western Railway and Midland Railway which ran from Sneyd Park Junction, south of , via , to join up with the national network at Narroways Hill Junction. The link opened in 1877, but initially only for goods trains. The route from Sneyd Park Junction to Clifton Down was subsequently cleared for passenger use on 3 August 1878, but the Midland and Great Western Railways did not think the BPRP track was in a suitable condition and so refused to run any passenger trains beyond Clifton Down. Services along the BPRP however increased to eight trains per day in each direction from 1877, and then to ten each way by 1887. From 1 September 1885, when passenger services along the link finally started, the Great Western offered six trains per day each direction between and . Fearing competition, the BPRP did not allow passengers to use GWR services between its stations. The Midland Railway did not run any passenger services beyond Clifton Down, apart from a one-month trial service in September 1885. Despite the increased traffic the BPRP suffered financially, and was taken over by the CER in 1890. In 1893 the platform was lengthened to at a cost of ¬£235, and a station master's house built. A second track was laid along the line in 1903, and a new platform built on the south side of the line, coming into use on 16 May. The station was remodelled at the same time, adding comfortable waiting rooms. The new platform had a waiting room and 20-lever signal box built on it, with an open footbridge to connect the two platforms. A small goods yard and coal sidings were added behind the northern platform, accessible from the east. The yard was subsequently extended in 1921 by Nott Brodie & Co Ltd to handle traffic from construction of the Bristol Portway. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920. During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot was located nearby, with Shirehampton station handling the goods traffic, with up to 60 wagons per day inbound, mostly containing hay and sawdust for the horses. Twelve wagons of manure were dispatched each day, some to Cadbury Road on the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway. After the war, construction of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated the closure of the line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily towards Bristol and six toward Avonmouth. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. At this point Shirehampton station employed a station master, three clerks and four porters; throughout the 1930s there were an average of ten staff. From 1928 many services to Avonmouth were extended to . By 1947, just before the railways were nationalised, there were 33 services each direction between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, with 18 on Sundays. Some trains made circular trips to and from Temple Meads via Clifton Down and or . =British Rail and privatisation= When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Shirehampton passed to Regional Railways. At this time, all trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times, but northbound services were terminated at Avonmouth. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway (FOSBR) and a string of protests, services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line, and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours (24 trains per day). Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010. Future First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Shirehampton are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines, so Shirehampton will continue to be served by diesel trains, with the current \\"Sprinter\\" units expected to be replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. Stephen Williams, former MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line. Improved services at Shirehampton are called for as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, with trains towards Bristol terminating alternately at and , however due to the large sections of the Severn Beach Line which are single-track and to the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There are also calls for the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line, which could allow a direct service from Shirehampton to via . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, however Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.

The creek runs for from a lake northeast of Packard Ridge to the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay by way of Niles Canyon and a flood control channel. History Five Spanish expeditions led by de Portol√†, Ortega, Fages, de Anza and Amador passed over Alameda Creek between 1769 and 1795. El Camino Viejo between Pleasanton and Mission Pass crossed it near Sunol. Mission San Jos√©, in Fremont, was dedicated in 1797. The Mission thrived for 49 years until the Mexican Government's Secularization Order liquidated mission lands in 1834. Alameda Creek was the boundary of the mission lands and the Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda granted to Jose de Jesus Vallejo, who built a flour mill near the mouth of Niles Canyon. The mill and the importance of the canyon as a passage through the hills led to growth of Niles (which in 1956 became part of Fremont, California) in the 1850s. A favorable climate, excellent soils, and a fast-growing population helped agriculture to boom. Early roads led to landings where small ships would load grain and other foodstuffs for transport to market. Alameda Creek is the most important stream in Alameda County. From this Creek is derived the name of the County. Alameda Creek was the former boundary between Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties during the period from 1850, when Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were formed, to 1853 when Alameda County was carved from the two Counties. The portion of Alameda County south of Alameda Creek is the only part of Alameda County that is not derived from Contra Costa County. Central Pacific Railroad, and Alameda Creek. Stereo photo taken between 1867 and 1869. Completion of the Central Pacific Railroad through Niles Canyon in 1869 was essential to completion of First Transcontinental Railroad that terminated at Alameda Terminal and Oakland Long Wharf that same year. The Western Pacific was also routed through Niles Canyon, connecting Sacramento, California and San Jose, California in 1906. The creek bed had once been used as a gravel quarry.Chen, E., McMahon, P., Shorno, A., By, F., Bautista, J., Goza, G., ... & Inn, S. D. (2012). Alameda County Water District, Engineering Department, Groundwater Resources Division. When the gravel pits were flooded by water purchased by the public for groundwater recharge of the Niles Cone, the gravel harvesters began to daily pump out enough water to meet the needs of 30,000 people down the creek into San Francisco Bay.Victor E. Gleason, Water Projects Go Underground, 5 Ecology L.Q. (1976) discussing Niles Sand & Gravel v. Alameda County Water Dist., 37 Cal. App. 3d 924, 112 Cal. Rptr. 846 (Ct. App. 1974). After the pumping was declared to be an illegal waste the Alameda County Water District acquired the quarry in 1975. In May 2015, vandals damaged an inflatable dam across the creek in Fremont, releasing 50 million gallons (190 million litres) of drinking water into San Francisco Bay. Alameda Creek watershed Alameda Creek at the flats of Niles where it has emerged from the Niles Canyon. Alameda Creek is the largest watershed within the southern San Francisco Bay, draining 700 square miles (1,813 square kilometers), or about 20% of the total drainage area for the south Bay. Two-thirds of the watershed is in Alameda County including the reach through the Sunol Valley, the rest is in Santa Clara County. The tributaries of Alameda creek include Arroyo de la Laguna, Arroyo Valle, San Antonio Creek and Calaveras Creek, whose main tributary is Arroyo Hondo. The watershed includes three man-made reservoirs: Lake Del Valle, San Antonio Reservoir and Calaveras Reservoir. The Alameda Creek Watershed can be divided into six major reaches: * Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel ‚Äì the channelized, trapezoidal section extending from the Bay upstream to the Niles Canyon area * Niles Canyon ‚Äì the area above the flood control section to the confluence of the Alameda Creek mainstem and Arroyo de la Laguna * Upper Alameda Creek (above the confluence with Arroyo de la Laguna) ‚Äì the reach extending up the mainstem of Alameda Creek into the canyons of the Sunol-Ohlone Regional Wilderness Area and beyond * Arroyo de la Laguna ‚Äì the reach paralleling Interstate 680 upstream of the confluence with the mainstem Alameda Creek, including the Alamo Canal, to its source at the confluence of South San Ramon Creek and Arroyo Mocho * Arroyo Valle ‚Äì the reach extending from the confluence with Arroyo de la Laguna upstream through Shadow Cliffs Regional Park to Del Valle Regional Park * Arroyo Mocho ‚Äì the reach extending upstream from the confluence with Arroyo de la Laguna through the Livermore‚ÄìAmador Valley and into unincorporated ranch and agricultural lands A more comprehensive list inclusive of minor as well as major named tributaries includes (from top of mainstem heading downstream) Valpe Creek (right), Bear Gulch (right), Whitlock Creek (right), Calaveras Creek (left), Leyden Creek (left), Indian Joe Creek (right), Welch Creek (right), Haynes Gulch (left), Pirate Creek (left), San Antonio Creek (right), Arroyo de la Laguna (right), Stonybrook Canyon (right) and Dry Creek (right). Alameda Creek now runs through the man-made Alameda Creek flood channel near the Bay, the latter is parallel to and south of the old Alameda Creek channel. Ward Creek is tributary to old Alameda Creek. Ecology, past and present Alameda Creek in Niles Canyon. Alameda Creek historically supported steelhead (the anadromous form of the coastal rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Confirmation that adult steelhead recently captured attempting to migrate into the Alameda Creek watershed, and the rainbow trout sampled in the upper watershed (trapped above complete migration barriers), are native fish that have their closest genetic associations with other populations within the federally threatened steelhead Central California Coast Evolutionarily Significant Unit has spurred a major effort to restore this historically important steelhead stream by removing barriers to migration and improving habitat quality. Since steelhead in the Bay Area and California's Central Coast were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1997, numerous organizations, including the Alameda Creek Alliance, and governmental agencies have cooperated on restoration projects to allow migratory fish from the Bay to reach spawning habitat in upper Alameda Creek, beginning in 1999. Alameda Creek is considered a potential ‚Äòanchor watershed‚Äô for steelhead, regionally significant for restoration of the threatened trout to the entire Bay Area, although by the late 1950s the California Department of Fish and Game decided the steelhead run was no longer viable due to numerous man-made barriers to fish runs. By the early 1970s the Army Corps of Engineers channeled and rip-rapped the lower of the creek. The last steelhead and coho salmon runs were seen in the lower creek in 1964. In 2009, the Alameda County Water District removed a rubber dam that blocked trout passage in the lower creek, adjacent to Quarry Lakes Regional Park. In June, 2010 environmentalists and water district officials celebrated the removal of a dam on Alameda Creek in Fremont, and the planned installation of fish ladders to allow salmonids to bypass two other dams on the lower creek. At the same time, PG&E; is working to modify a cement barrier farther upstream in Sunol to help steelhead swim farther into the watershed, water officials said. Ground was broken on the first ladder the Alameda County Water District is building in April 2018 and is just west of the Mission Boulevard overcrossing in the Niles district of Fremont, allowing passage around a rubber dam. The second ladder, which should start construction in 2019, is about a mile downstream at the concrete structure, called a weir. The two ladders are funded by nearly $10 million in grants from several agencies, including $5.36 million from the California Wildlife Conservation Board and $3 million from the California Natural Resources Agency. When those projects are completed in 2021, steelhead will be able to migrate upstream to spawning habitats in the Sunol Valley for the first time in a half-century. California's archaeological record has contributed to knowledge of the prehistoric distribution of fishes in Alameda Creek and its tributaries including Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus), Sacramento suckers (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), Tule perch (Hysterocarpus traskii), Hitches (Lavinia exilicauda), Hardheads (Mylopharodon conocephalus), Sacramento blackfish, and Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis). Many of these fishes still occupy the creek, although the number of introduced exotic fishes continues to increase. Exotic fish species such as the largemouth and Smallmouth basses (Micropterus salmoides and Micropterus dolomieui) respectively, were introduced to Alameda Creek (and the Napa River) by Livingston Stone in 1874. A view of the Mission Blvd bridge at Alameda Creek. There is historical evidence of beaver in the Alameda Creek watershed. In 1828 fur trapper Michel La Framboise travelled to \\"the missions of San Jos√©, San Francisco Solano and San Rafael Arc√°ngel. La Framboise stated that \\"the Bay of San Francisco abounds in beaver\\", and that he \\"made his best hunt in the vicinity of the missions\\". Alexander Roderick McLeod reported on the progress of the first Hudson's Bay Company fur brigade sent to California in 1829, \\"Beaver is become an article of traffic on the Coast as at the Mission of St. Joseph alone upwards of Fifteen hundred Beaver Skins were collected from the natives at a trifling value and sold to Ships at 3 Dollars\\". In the 1840s Kit Carson was granted rights to trap beaver on Alameda Creek in the East Bay where they \\"abounded...from the mouth of its canyon to the broad delta on the bay\\". Physical evidence of beaver include faunal remains in the Arroyo de la Laguna tributary recovered in an archaeological site west of Interstate 680. Beaver may be beneficial to efforts to restore salmonids in Alameda Creek as beaver ponds benefit oversummering salmonid smolts by raising the water table which then recharges streams in the dry summer season and also by providing perennial deep pools when streams are only seasonal. Conservation In January, 2011, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission won approvals to construct a replacement dam just downstream from the existing earthen Calaveras Dam, which has been maintained at 40% of capacity because of seismic concerns. However, construction of a fish ladder to provide steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) access to the waters above the dam were deemed not feasible because at , it would be the tallest fish ladder in the country, and would cost $40 million. Steelhead have not had access to spawning streams above Calaveras Dam since it was built in 1925. However, environmentalists won concessions from the SFPUC to assure adequate water releases from the new dam to improve summer flows as well as a smaller fish ladder around a diversion dam blocking access to upper Alameda Creek, which is regarded as prime trout habitat. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission removed two disused dams in the Niles Canyon reach of Alameda Creek to improve fish passage following assessing impacts in an Environmental Impact Report under CEQA.SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SUNOL/NILES DAM REMOVAL PROJECT, State Clearinghouse No. 2004072049, February 24, 2006.

Alameda Creek Regional Trail The Alameda Creek Regional Trail runs along Alameda Creek for . The trail starts in the Niles neighborhood of Fremont and continues westward to the San Francisco Bay through the cities of Union City and Newark. The trail consists of two parallel paths, one on each side of Alameda Creek. The path on the south side of the creek is paved, and can be used by pedestrians and bicyclists. The path on the north side of the creek is unpaved, and can be used by pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians. The trail provides direct access to Coyote Hills Regional Park and Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area.

They provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every forty minutes to and one every two hours to . The station was opened in 1877 by the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a railway which ran along the River Avon from to a pier at Avonmouth. The station, originally known as Avonmouth Dock, had a single platform, but was rebuilt with two platforms by the Great Western and Midland Railways in 1885 when they began services via . The station was enhanced numerous times in the early part of the twentieth century, and by 1913 employed 72 staff. Facilities included a goods yard, signal box and engine shed. The Severn Beach Line declined over the latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. Goods services at Avonmouth ended in 1966, and all staff were withdrawn in 1967. Services had decreased to 10 per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to 25 trains per day.  Description  The wooden canopy covering platform 2 at Avonmouth The station is located in the Avonmouth district of Bristol, an area of mixed industrial and residential usage. The station sits to the south of the junction of Gloucester Road and Portview Road, the tracks running to parallel to Portview Road and crossing Gloucester Road at a level crossing. The station is on the Severn Beach Line from to , from Temple Meads and from Severn Beach.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. It is the eighth station from Temple Meads. The next station towards Temple Meads is ; the next towards Severn Beach is . The station is on a north-west/south-east alignment, with two platforms separated by two running lines. The southern \\"up\\" platform, adjacent to the \\"Up Main\\" line, is used for trains towards Severn Beach. The northern \\"down\\" platform, adjacent to the \\"Down Main\\" line, is bidirectionally signalled, allowing it to be used by terminating trains and those heading towards Bristol. Both platforms have significant portions of their length fenced off, giving usable lengths of for the southern platform and for the northern. Facilities at the station are minimal ‚Äì there is a wooden canopy and bench seating on the northern platform, with a small metal shelter on the southern. Timetable information is provided; help points show next train information and allow users to contact railway staff. There is no ticket office or other means for buying or collecting tickets, however an electronic ticketing trial is to be rolled out at the station. There is a car park with six spaces, as well as stands for four bicycles. The nearest bus stops are away on Avonmouth Road. The line through Avonmouth has a speed limit of for locomotive-hauled trains and for diesel multiple units.

Services Class 166 at Avonmouth with a Severn Beach service Services at Avonmouth are all operated by Great Western Railway, using mainly diesel Turbo units. Avonmouth is the main terminus of the Severn Beach Line; there are 25 trains to and from each day from Monday to Friday, a service of three trains every two hours, giving a train every 40 minutes on average. Of these, one train every two hours runs to and from . Most services start at Bristol, but one evening service to Avonmouth starts at . On Saturdays there is a similar level of service, at 24 trains per day. Sunday sees a roughly hourly service to and from Bristol, ten trains per day, with only two services extending to Severn Beach, except during the May‚ÄìSeptember timetable period when all services are extended. The first and last Sunday trains towards Bristol are extended to via , and there are similar workings in the other direction. Most trains from Avonmouth to Temple Meads call at all stations, but some services omit . Trains making the journey to and from Severn Beach call at alternately on the outward or return leg. The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is roughly 30 minutes, and 12 minutes to Severn Beach. In 2012, the single fare to Clifton Down or Severn Beach was ¬£1.50, and ¬£3 return for the whole line.  History  = Construction and early operations = The Railway Clearing House Atlas of 1914 shows the then-extensive railway network around Avonmouth. The railways first came to Avonmouth in 1865, when services began on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier (BPRP), a self-contained railway which ran along the north bank of the River Avon to a deep water pier on the Severn Estuary. The BPRP line ran through the site of the current station and beyond to a terminus at the first Avonmouth station. The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871 when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build-up of silt. With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network, the Clifton Extension Railway (CER) was approved. This was a joint venture by the BPRP, Great Western Railway (GWR) and Midland Railway (MR) which ran from Sneyd Park Junction, south of , via , to join up with the national network at Narroways Hill Junction. The link opened in 1877, but initially only for goods trains. The route from Sneyd Park Junction to Clifton Down was subsequently cleared for passenger use on 3 August 1878, but the Midland and Great Western Railways did not think the BPRP track was in a suitable condition and so refused to run any passenger trains beyond Clifton Down. The station, originally known as Avonmouth Dock, was opened in 1877, shortly after the opening of the Avonmouth Docks in February that year. It was built on, or very near to, the site of a halt built in 1868 for the Docks' construction workers. The local area was still mostly rural ‚Äì there were a few buildings around the station area, as well as the docks, with the closest extent of the Bristol conurbation away at Shirehampton. The station cost ¬£275 to build, and was merely a platform on the south side of the single track, served by eight trains per day between and the BPRP's Avonmouth terminus, increasing to ten per day from 1887. The Great Western and Midland Railways considered the station inadequate for the passenger numbers expected, and so purchased additional land to enhance the station with extra tracks. The new station comprised a wide island platform ‚Äì the northern face on the original through line, the southern face being for a new terminal line. The station, now known as Avonmouth Dock Joint, was constructed using mainly wood and corrugated iron. It was opened on 1 September 1885, coinciding with the beginning of passenger services beyond Clifton Down. The Great Western initially offered six trains per day each direction between Avonmouth Dock and . Fearing competition, the BPRP did not allow passengers to use GWR services between its stations. The Midland Railway did not run any passenger services beyond Clifton Down, apart from a one-month trial service in September 1885. Despite the increased traffic the BPRP suffered financially, and was taken over by the CER in 1890. The BPRP's Avonmouth terminus closed to the public in 1902, after which all trains terminated at Avonmouth Dock. = Early twentieth century = The station went through numerous enhancements in the first part of the twentieth century. A new platform canopy and urinal were provided in 1900 at a cost of ¬£250. Further improvements followed in 1902 at a cost of ¬£80; and in August 1904 significant enhancements to the station buildings and an extension of the platform cost a total of ¬£1,570. A turntable was constructed in December 1903; with a signal box, known as Avonmouth Dock Passenger, installed at the end of the platform. Dedicated goods staff were employed from the start of 1904, with that year also seeing the installation of a run-around loop for the terminal platform. A small engine shed was added in January 1905. In 1910, some passenger trains once again began to run beyond Avonmouth Dock, continuing towards on the newly opened Henbury Loop Line, which allowed goods trains to the docks to avoid the steep Clifton Down Tunnel. Other trains arrived from London via the loop, connecting with steamer services to Canada and Jamaica. At this point there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth Dock and 15 back each day; increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920. The station was well- staffed, with 25 station staff and 47 goods staff in 1913. Positions included stationmaster; booking clerks; posters; and outdoor porters, who took goods to ships in the docks. During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot was located near Shirehampton. Over the course of the war, Avonmouth Dock Joint handled 35,000 animals, mainly horses and mules, en route to the depot. July 1917 saw the introduction of platform tickets, to capitalise on people using the station to bid farewell to friends heading overseas, or to welcome those returning. The platform was lengthened to in December 1917. A second through track was added in 1918, and so a new cinder-covered platform was built on the north side of the line. The two platforms were linked by a footbridge and a level crossing. The cost of the new platform and the lengthening works was ¬£7,420. After the war, construction of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated the closure of the line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The engine shed was closed in 1924. By the mid-1920s, the station was proving inadequate for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926. The new buildings were made of brick; with a large, four-chimneyed building containing most of the facilities; as well as a separate parcels office. The northern platform had a wooden awning built, which is still in place today. From 1928 many services to Avonmouth Dock were extended to . By 1947, just before the railways were nationalised, there were 33 services each direction between Avonmouth Dock and Temple Meads, with 18 on Sundays. Some trains made circular trips to and from Temple Meads via Clifton Down and Henbury or . = British Rail and privatisation = The station in 1992, looking along the lines towards Bristol. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Avonmouth Dock came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. By 1955, service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from Bristol and 29 return, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 20 June 1966, the same day that the station was renamed \\"Avonmouth\\". The bay platform was taken out of use and the land later taken for industrial buildings. From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Avonmouth, with tickets issued by the train guard. The station buildings on the island platform survived into the 1970s, as did the footbridge, but with the exception of the parcels office, all were later demolished. The parcels office was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon. The signal box was closed in January 1969, and in September 1973 the wooden level crossing gates were replaced by automatic lifting barriers. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services to Severn Beach. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Avonmouth passed to Regional Railways. At this time, all trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times, but northbound services were terminated at Avonmouth. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway and a string of protests, services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, subsequently rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line, and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours (25 trains per day). Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010. The old parcel facility, the last- surviving station building, was demolished in 2015. The final remaining station building, the old parcels office, was demolished in 2015. Local rail campaigners, including Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways and MP Charlotte Leslie, petitioned to prevent the demolition, however Network Rail stated that the cost of restoration was too high and that it had become a safety risk.  Future  First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Avonmouth are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines, so Avonmouth will continue to be served by diesel trains. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line. Improved services at Avonmouth are called for as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, with trains towards Bristol terminating alternately at and , however due to the large sections of the Severn Beach Line which are single-track, and to the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. The enhancement scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There are also calls for the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line, which could allow a direct service from Avonmouth to . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, however Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.

Pipile jacutinga is mainly black with a bluish gloss; it has a conspicuous white wing patch bearing 3 neat rows of tiny black dots. The large crest is whitish, and it has a red throat wattle with a dark blue patch at the front. Its naked whitish eye-ring and black-feathered face and forehead are unique in its genus. The legs and feet are red. No other piping guan is found in its range, though the Gray's piping guan (Pipile cumanensis grayi) approaches it in Paraguay. This bird has a pale bluish pendulous wattle, a smaller wing patch, and an entirely naked white face and white forehead.

AJP is a highly trusted protocol and should never be exposed to untrusted clients, which could use it to gain access to sensitive information or execute code on the application server. It also supports some monitoring in that the web server can ping the application server. Web implementors typically use AJP in a load-balanced deployment where one or more front-end web servers feed requests into one or more application servers. Sessions are redirected to the correct application server using a routing mechanism wherein each application server instance gets a name (called a route). In this scenario the web server functions as a reverse proxy for the application server. Lastly, AJP supports request attributes which, when populated with environment-specific settings in the reverse proxy, provides for secure communication between the reverse proxy and application server. AJP runs in Apache HTTP Server 1.x using the mod_jk plugin and in Apache 2.x using the provided Proxy AJP, mod_proxy and proxy balancer modules together. Implementations exist for the not-yet-released lighttpd version 1.5, nginx, Grizzly 2.1, and the Internet Information Server. Web containers supporting AJP include Apache Tomcat, JBoss AS/WildFly, and GlassFish. History Alexei Kosut originally developed the Apache JServ Protocol in July 1997 but the version 1.0 specification was published later on July 29, 1998. He also wrote the first implementations of it in the same month, with the releases of the Apache JServ servlet engine 0.9 and the Apache mod_jserv 0.9a (released on July 30, 1997). The specification was updated to version 1.1 on September 9, 1998. Also in 1998, a revamped protocol was created and published in specification versions 2 and 2.1, however it was never adopted. In 1999, Sun Microsystems donated their JavaServer Web Development Kit (JSWDK; codenamed Tomcat) reference implementation to Apache Software Foundation. This became Apache Tomcat version 3.0, the successor to JSWDK 2.1, and derailed further development of Apache JServ servlet engine and AJP towards support of Java servlet API version 2.1. The current specification remains at version 1.3, however there is a published extension proposal as well as an archived experimental 1.4 proposal.

This is the terminus of the Severn Beach Line. This station is north west from Bristol Temple Meads on the Severn Beach Line. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who are also the sole provider of trains serving the station.  History  The railway reached Severn Beach in 1900, but was at first used only for goods traffic to Pilning. A platform was built beside the line at Severn Beach by the Great Western Railway in 1922, and a bay platform added to the west for excursion traffic, with terminating passenger services from Bristol starting on 26 May 1924, subsequently extended to in a loop back to Bristol via from 9 July 1928. By 1924 a brick concourse had been built perpendicular to the bay platform, providing a ticket office, the station master's office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. The station master and keeper of the level crossing were also provided with houses, while to the east of the platform were sidings, primarily for stabling of excursion trains. In November 1964 through services to Pilning ceased,History of the Severn Beach Line with the line north closed completely in July 1968, although goods traffic at Severn Beach had already ended in 1963. More recently, services to Severn Beach have been cut back further, with only one in three trains to now continuing on to Severn Beach. The concourse and other station buildings have been demolished, replaced with a small metal and glass shelter, while the eastern rails have been pulled up, leaving just the bay platform remaining.

Owned by Blackstone and managed by JLL, the centre is among the oldest in Victoria, opening on 30 June 1964 as an outdoor strip shopping centre, before being developed over the years into its current three level indoor form. Currently, Forest Hill Chase contains 200 stores and over 3500 free car parking spaces. The centre has three supermarkets, two discount department stores and some smaller anchor stores. The architecture is distinguished by a roof of polycarbonate construction with a barrel vault design. History Forest Hill opened as a strip mall shopping centre in June 1964, this included the first Safeway (now Woolworths) store in Australia, before gradually growing during the 1970s and 1980s with larger stores, a multi-deck car park adjacent to Canterbury Road, the development of a Woolworths supermarket and an enclosed two storey building at the southern end of the centre where BIG W resided along with Harris Scarfe and Woolworths that also currently resides in that area. Forest Hill's conversion from a hybrid (strip mall / indoor) centre to a fully indoor site began in June 1987 with the demolition of the strip mall section, and the construction of a three-storey extension to the existing building, which housed major tenants including Coles, Venture, Kmart and Hoyts, and was completed in 1989. During circa 1997, Harris Scarfe was downsized from its two level form to occupying only level 1, to allow a new Big W store to open in the now vacant space on level 2. An AMF (now Zone Bowling) and children's play centre Run Riot was constructed on Level 3 a couple of years later. In December 2004, Melbourne businessman Maurice Alter sold the Forest Hill Chase shopping centre to listed retail property trust CFS Gandel, managed by Colonial First State Property, for $214.5 million. The sale was close to being the largest national (Australian) retail property deal of the year and it included property management rights and the potential for redevelopment. At the time of purchase, Colonial First State Property fund manager Bevan Towning ruled out any immediate major redevelopment plans, saying the intention was to change the centre's retailing mix by introducing the same national brands it had at its other shopping centres, Chadstone and Northland. They also wanted to revitalize the centre and give it a \\"new look\\". 2007‚Äì2012 major redevelopments =Levels one and two (2006‚àí2007)= In the biggest redevelopment of the centre since 1989, levels one and two of the centre were completely refurbished in 2007. Major milestones of the redevelopment program, which started in December 2006, are as follows: * The Relocation of Kmart Tyre & Auto Service from next to the centre entrance to the former Kmart, to a new free standing site in Pacific Way, which was completed in March 2007. * The refurbishment of the level one and two interior malls, with new floor tiling laid, removal of the traditional gold balustrades with modern steel balustrades installed, and the removal of the stairwells at the south of the centre near Big W. * The level two toilets were fully refurbished, completed in June 2007. * The Mahoneys Road entrance was upgraded, with the existing canopy replaced and upgraded with a terrace installed on level 3 for use by The Chase Hotel, which was completed by June 2007. * Kmart's permanent closure on 31 January 2007 and subsequent conversion to a Target, which opened in September 2007. * The refurbishment and extension of the food court, completed in September 2007. =Level three (2010‚Äì2011)= The third level was expanded and refurbished during the second half of 2010, complementing the earlier refurbishment of the other levels of the centre and introducing a number of new tenants. The redeveloped level officially re- opened on 15 December 2010 with some retailers opening earlier or later in the following months. * The refurbishment of level 3, including mall reconfiguration, expansion and renovation, new escalators between levels two and three, and a new centre entry to a new car park, completed in December 2010. * The construction of an additional deck of car parking located west of Hoyts above the existing Target/Coles multi-deck car park, including 317 spaces, opening on 15 December 2010. * Establishing a new 'Entertainment and Dining' precinct with a refurbished Hoyts cinema, three new restaurants as well as new minor anchor retailers JB Hi-Fi, Rebel Sport and gymnasium Fit n Fast. = Replacing Myer and new fresh food market (2012)= In 2012, Harris Scarfe returned to the centre and spent more than $2 million redeveloping the store in the area previously occupied by Myer. The centre also expanded its fresh food market on level one, which included a new ALDI supermarket on top of the Canterbury Road multi deck car park, which caused a small increase in undercover parking. A new refurbished bus zone was also built as a result. (A temporary bus zone was constructed adjacent to Kmart Tyre & Auto during construction). = Minor improvements (2013)= The glass lift in the food court that travels from the basement car park through to level 3 was replaced, as the existing lift was too small, causing heavy congestion as it became the only fully accessible way to move between levels 2 and 3 after a past level 3 redevelopment. The expanded lift is now operating and carries up to 26 people. New facade and centre entrance treatments were also installed along the Canterbury Road car park frontage and around the Level 2 Best and less centre entry. = Renovations and re-configurations (2017‚Äì2019) = In late 2017, the latest renovations started, which were to completely revamp the third floor, and partially renovate the second floor. \\\\- The east wing of the Level 2 mall, which formerly housed Dimmeys and a few other retailers, was closed down for several months and completely renovated and re-configured. Dimmeys moved to a smaller location near the Level 1 food court (which later closed down permanently) with Rebel and JB Hi-Fi moving from their former Level 3 tenancies. The escalators linking Level 2 and Level 3 were also removed to allow for more retail space. \\\\- In 2018, Big W closed down, with a new TK Maxx store occupying part of the available space, with its entrance opposite the newly re-located Rebel and JB Hi-Fi stores. A new Medical Centre and Child Care Centre will occupy the remainder of the space of the former Big W. \\\\- In 2019, Level 3 was renovated, with the space left behind by Rebel and JB Hi-Fi being converted into more dining retailers, with the whole level getting a refurbishment and being branded as \\"The Loft\\". Zone Bowling (formerly AMF) and Timezone were also renovated to combine the two tenancies together with a new look. A new glass lift was also installed near the travelator located outside Woolworths with access to all levels.

He played 12 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Zimbabwe in 2006, and a number of T20 Internationals (T20Is) for Cayman Islands in 2019. In 2003-04, playing for Matabeleland, he scored 128 and 104 in a game against Manicaland, an innings which included 16 sixes. Strydom had scored a career best 216 against the same opposition just three weeks earlier. He struggled to succeed in international cricket however, making just one half century in his 12 ODIs for Zimbabwe and failing to score in double figures in seven of them. Career with Zimbabwe =Kenya tour 2005-06= Strydom made his ODI debut in this 5-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe by Kenya. The final result was 2-2 (the final match was rained off) and Strydom made his debut in the first ODI alongside Duffin, Rinke and Meth. =West Indies tour 2005-06= Strydom was also picked for the 16-man touring party of Zimbabwe's West Indies tour. Zimbabwe lost the 7-match ODI series 5-0. The highlight of Strydom's tour was his 48 at the 5th match at Gros Islet, St Lucia. Zimbabwe went on to lose by 10 wickets but Strydom's 2nd highest score was the meat of Zimbabwe's 152/10. The best moment was his two successive sixes off Dave Mohammed on Mohammed's ODI debut. =Bangladesh series 2006= Strydom was picked for the Zimbabwe squad to play 5 home ODIs against Bangladesh; Zimbabwe won the series 3-2. Strydom's 58 during the 4th ODI was his career best, coming off 58 balls with eight 4s and one 6, helping Zimbabwe to a seven wicket win and secure the series. =ICC Champions Trophy 2006-07= Strydom was picked in the 14-man squad for the 2006-07 ICC Champions Trophy in India. He was put in the team for Zimbabwe's 3rd and final game against Bangladesh after defeats by West Indies and Sri Lanka. He only made 4 before he was clean bowled by Mohammad Rafique as Zimbabwe slipped to 130 all out in 44.4 overs, chasing the 231 set by Bangladesh. =South Africa tour 2006-07= Strydom was picked in Zimbabwe's 16-man squad for the 3 match ODI and 1 match Twenty20 International tour of South Africa. Zimbabwe lost all the games and Strydom failed to make an impact. Move to the Cayman Islands In August 2019, he was named in the Cayman Islands cricket team's T20I squad for the Regional Finals of the 2018‚Äì19 ICC T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier tournament. He made his T20I debut for the Cayman Islands against Canada on 18 August 2019. He made his international debut for the team against Canada on 18 August 2019, top scoring for the team with 49.

The hospital provides a range of specialist services including major trauma care, paediatric intensive care, cardiac, renal, hepatic, orthopaedic surgeries, and operates the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for the city. The service operates as part of Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, whose CEO is Sarah- Jane Marsh. History The hospital was established as the Birmingham and Midland Free Hospital for Sick Children at 138‚Äì9 Steelhouse Lane in 1862.Children in Hospital - A Hundred Years of Child Care in Birmingham, Rachel Waterhouse, Hutchinson & Co., 1962 It moved to a new site on Ladywood Middleway in 1917. In March 1986, a charity concert was held called \\"Heart Beat 86\\" at the nearby National Exhibition Centre, featuring George Harrison, which raised money for the hospital. In October 1998 the hospital returned to Steelhouse Lane, to the buildings previously used by the Birmingham General Hospital, as the Diana, Princess of Wales Children's Hospital - in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died the year before. The opening ceremony was carried out by the Queen. In 2007, a new extension designed by RPS Group was opened. The extension created a burns unit, one of three such centres of excellence in the country. As well as this, it established an outpatients department, a neonatal ward, a burns operating theatre, as well as additional classrooms for the Education Centre, allowing children to continue their education whilst undergoing medium to long term care in the hospital. Facilities Helipad between hospital and the Inner Ring Road The trust led a consortium of organisations called Forward Thinking Birmingham commissioned to provide mental health services for young people in the city up to the age of 25 from April 2016. Services for adults were previously provided by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. In 1970, surgeons completed the first separation of conjoined twins at the hospital. Management The hospital was managed by the Birmingham Children‚Äôs Hospital NHS Trust until 2017 when it merged with the Women's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to create the Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust. The current chair of the trust is Sir Bruce Keogh and Chief Executive Sarah- Jane Marsh. She was appointed Chief Executive of Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust with effect from 1 July 2015 and now runs the Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Performance The trust was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 3236 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.39%. 89% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 74% recommended it as a place to work. The Trust's Professor Anita Macdonald, Consultant Paediatric Dietitian was awarded an OBE for services to Dietetics in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2015. In 2016, it became the first children's hospital to be rated Outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.

The Nepal Citizenship Act 1964 was first promulgated on 28 February 1964 and provides for a single citizenship for the entire country to inherit Nepali nationality. The Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006 was enacted on 26 November 2006. It repeals the 1964 Act and makes further provisions for acquisition and termination of Nepali citizenship and related matters. Citizenship by virtue of Nepali descent or blood Nepalese citizenship is based on the principles of jus sanguinis or bloodline. Generally, a person born of parents who are citizens of Nepal will have a claim to citizenship of Nepal on the basis of descent and every minor found in Nepal whose parents' whereabouts is not known will have a claim to citizenship of Nepal on the basis of descent until the whereabouts of the parents is known. NB: Prior to the passage of the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006 on 26 November 2006, Nepal citizenship was transmissible only through a Nepalese father. Since passage of the new Act, a Nepalese mother can transmit her citizenship to a child. Citizenship by birth Prior to 26 November 2006, there was no provision for acquisition of Nepalese citizenship by virtue of birth in Nepal. Under the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006, a person who was born in Nepal before mid-April 1990, has permanent domicile and been continuously resident in Nepal throughout his life can apply to acquire citizenship of Nepal on the basis of birth. Such persons will have to submit either land ownership certificates or house ownership certificates or their registration number in voters' lists to obtain. Citizenship by naturalization Any foreign national of full age and capacity may submit an application to obtain Nepali citizenship if: * He/she can speak and write in the national language of Nepal. * He/she is engaged in any occupation in Nepal. * He/she has relinquished his/her citizenship of another state. * He/she has resided in Nepal for at least 15 years. * He/she is a citizen of a country where there is legal provision or a custom to provide naturalized citizenship to Nepali nationals: and * He/she is of good conduct and character. A man or woman who is married to a Nepali citizen may submit an application to become a citizen of Nepal. They shall enclose along with such application evidence of their marriage to a Nepali national, and of having initiated action to relinquish their foreign citizenship. Any person who is the son, daughter or descendant of any Nepali national may apply to obtain Nepali citizenship if: * He/she can speak and write in the national language of Nepal; * He/she has relinquished the citizenship of another state; * He/she has been residing in Nepal for the past two years with the intention of residing in Nepal permanently; and * He/she is virtuous, of good conduct and character. Nepal citizenship certificates In Nepal, a Citizenship certificate (the legal paper denoting citizenship) is issued only to persons who have attained the age of eighteen. A person who is more than 18 years old and who wants to acquire citizenship certificate on the basis of birth or descent is required to apply for the same by including with the application the Nepali citizenship certificate of one's father, mother or the close relative in his lineage, one's birth certificate, the certificate attesting one's lineage, the recommendation of the Village Development Committee or Municipality concerned, the land-ownership certificate in one's name, father's name or mother's name, or the receipt of the house tax. There is a total prohibition on dual nationality in Nepal. To lawfully be issued a citizenship certificate, a person must have no other allegiances. If a Nepal citizenship certificate holder, at any time, possesses any other nationality or citizenship the Nepal citizenship certificate issued to him automatically becomes invalid or void. Relinquishment and restoration of Nepali citizenship  Relinquishment is covered in Section 10 of the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006. If any Nepali citizen notifies the prescribed authority, in the prescribed manner of his decision to relinquish Nepali citizenship, the prescribed authority may register such notice, and his Nepali citizenship shall cease to exist with effect from the date of such recording. Section 11 of the Nepal Citizenship Act provides for any person who has relinquished the citizenship of Nepal and desires to again become a citizen of Nepal to reacquire Nepali citizenship. The person must submit an application, along with evidence of his having been a citizen of Nepal previously, and also of having relinquished any foreign citizenship he has held. Automatic termination of Nepali citizenship Dual nationality is not permitted under Nepal law. Nepalese authorities have confirmed, as recently as November 2006, that \\"there is a total prohibition on dual nationality in Nepal\\". Termination is covered in Section 10 of the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006. Section 10(1) of the act provides that the Nepalese citizenship of \\"any\\" Nepalese citizen shall automatically lapse on his acquiring the citizenship of any foreign country. Any citizen of Nepal who by naturalization, registration or by any other act acquires a foreign nationality, immediately ceases to be a citizen of Nepal irrespective of whether they are an adult or minor. Section 10(4) of the act provides that any Nepalese person who by birth is deemed a citizen of a foreign country and has a claim to citizenship of Nepal jus sanguinis (by blood) must choose a citizenship between sixteen and eighteen years of age. If he fails to do so, his claim to Nepalese citizenship shall automatically lapse on his eighteenth birthday. Persons of Nepalese origin born in Hong Kong Recent clarification of Nepalese Citizenship law has meant a number of persons born in Hong Kong who failed to renounce their British nationality before the age of 21 and were previously thought to be citizens of Nepal are in fact solely British. The British Government has recently accepted that certain Nepalese passport holders born in Hong Kong before 30 June 1976 are British Overseas citizens, and can register for full British citizenship (with right of abode in the UK) if they wish to do so. 690px In July 2005, the British Home Office authorities accepted that \\"\\"it is clear from Section 9(2) of the Nepalese Citizenship Act 1964 that anyone who is a dual Nepalese citizen by birth will automatically lose their Nepali citizenship when they reach the age of 21 if they have not renounced their other citizenship. Therefore it would be sufficient for our purposes for an applicant to provide evidence that they are over 21 and hold British status.\\" The British Consulate-General Hong Kong website has been updated to reflect that Nepalese persons in this category are British Overseas citizens and can register as British citizens. British authorities have also confirmed that anyone wishing to obtain a letter stating that they held British nationality on 4 February 1997 and 30 June 1997 can obtain one by applying to British Consulate in Hong Kong.https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2007-01-23a.213.3&s;=section%3Awrans+speaker%3A12876#g213.4 As a result of representations made by Lord Avebury regarding the rights to British nationality of persons of Nepalese origin born in Hong Kong before the handover, on 22 November 2006 a meeting took place between representatives of the Nepalese and British Governments to discuss aspects of Nepalese nationality law. Representatives from the Nepalese Ministries of Foreign and Home Affairs, the Nationality Directorate of the Home Office, the Consular Directorate of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, and the Consular Section at the British Embassy in Nepal attended the meeting. Travel freedom Visa requirements for Nepalese citizens In 2016, Nepalese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 37 countries and territories, ranking the Nepalese passport 98th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.

The administrative role was taken over by the Telecommunications Industry Association in 1997 and is still maintained by them. ESNs are currently mainly used with CDMA phones (and were previously used by AMPS and TDMA phones), compared to International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers used by all GSM phones. The first eight bits of the ESN were originally the manufacturer code, leaving 24 bits for the manufacturer to assign up to 16,777,215 codes to mobiles. To allow more than 256 manufacturers to be identified, the manufacturer code was extended to 14 bits, leaving 18 bits for the manufacturer to assign up to 262,144 codes. Manufacturer code 0x80 is reserved from assignment and is used instead as an eight-bit prefix for pseudo-ESNs (pESN). The remaining 24 bits are the least significant bits of the SHA-1 hash of a mobile equipment identifier (MEID). Pseudo-ESNs are not guaranteed to be unique (the MEID is the unique identifier if the phone has a pseudo-ESN). ESNs are often represented as either 11-digit decimal numbers or eight digit hexadecimal numbers. For the decimal format the first three digits are the decimal representation of the first eight bits (between 00 and 255 inclusive) and the next eight digits are derived from the remaining 24 bits and will be between 0000000 and 16777215 inclusive. The decimal format of pseudo ESNs will therefore begin with 128. The decimal format separately displays eight bit manufacturer codes in the first three digits, but 14 bit codes are not displayed as separate digits. The hexadecimal format displays an ESN as eight digits and also does not separately display 14 bit manufacturer codes which occupy 3.5 hexadecimal digits. As ESNs have essentially run out, a new serial number format, MEID, was created by 3GPP2 and was first implemented by Verizon in 2006. MEIDs are 56 bits long, the same length as the IMEI and, in fact, MEID was created to be a superset of IMEI. The main difference between MEID and IMEI is that the MEID allows hexadecimal digits while IMEI allows only decimal digits ‚Äì \\"IMEI shall consist of decimal digits (0 through 9) only\\".3GPP TS 23.003, V9.0.0, 2009‚Äì09 The last of the previously unused ESN codes were allocated in November 2008.https://www.tiaonline.org/standards_/resources/esn/documents/esn_meid_milestones_timeline.pdf Applications for assignments were accepted until June 30, 2010 using reclaimed ESN codes, those previously assigned to AMPS or TDMA phones and therefore not present on CDMA2000 systems.

Education and early life Rous was born in Woodlawn, Maryland in 1879 and received his B.A. and M.D. from Johns Hopkins University. Career and research Rous was involved in the discovery of the role of viruses in the transmission of certain types of cancer. On October 13, 1966, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work. In 1911, as a pathologist, he made his seminal observation that a malignant tumor (specifically, a sarcoma) growing on a domestic chicken could be transferred to another fowl simply by exposing the healthy bird to a cell-free filtrate. This finding, that cancer could be transmitted by a virus (now known as the Rous sarcoma virus, a retrovirus), was widely discredited by most of the field's experts at that time. Since he was a relative newcomer, it was several years before anyone even tried to replicate his prescient results. However, some influential researchers were impressed enough to nominate him to the Nobel Committee as early as 1926 (and in many subsequent years). Rous finally received the award 40 years later at the age of 87; he remains the oldest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology.Rous as oldest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology Awards and honors In addition to the Nobel Prize, Peyton Rous was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1940, and he won the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1958 and the National Medal of Science in 1965. Personal life In his later life he wrote biographies of Simon Flexner and Karl Landsteiner. His wife Marion died in 1985. His daughter Marni Hodgkin was a children's book editor, and the wife of another Nobel Prize winner, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin. References Further reading *Cornwall, Claudia M.

Anthony at the University of California, Berkeley. Lasting eighty years, it was the first successful student humor magazine in UC Berkeley, though it was preceded by Smiles in 1891 and Josh in 1895. It is succeeded by the Heuristic Squelch, which is still running. Description Gender was significant in the magazine's name. Although early issues carried an illustration of the eponymous bird on its cover, at the turn of the twentieth century ‚Äúpelican‚Äù was actually an uncomplimentary term for Berkeley coeds. The publication was even often referred to as ‚Äúthe Old Girl,‚Äù in contrast to its cross-bay counterpart, the Stanford Chaparral, known as ‚Äúthe Old Boy.‚Äù Often referred to simply as the Pelican, the magazine featured cartoons, poetry, original humor articles, and short jokes reprinted from other college humor magazines such as the Pennsylvania Punchbowl and Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern. Aside from its wealthy founder, the magazine's most well known contributor was Rube Goldberg, who drew cartoons for the magazine as a student. Goldberg recalled in later years that he ‚Äúhad great admiration for Earle Anthony, the editor of the Pelican, a tall, gangling young man who wore his floppy senior stovepipe at a jaunty angle and took long strides across the campus like one who had the past, present and future all wrapped in a nice secure package. When he accepted one of my drawings it gave me a greater thrill than a good mark in calculus or geology.‚ÄùRube Goldberg, ‚ÄúRube Goldberg,‚Äù in There Was Light: Autobiography of a University, Berkeley: 1868-1968, ed. Irving Stone (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1970), 413 Additionally, science fiction author Ron Goulart wrote for the magazine and later republished one of his Pelican articles professionally. History According to Verne Stadtman's Centennial Record, the magazine was founded on April 16, 1903 by Anthony and an original staff of ten. It eventually became sponsored by the Associated Students and by the 1960s was issued once a month during each school year. The Centennial Record lists its circulation as 7,000 copies per issue in 1965, making it the second largest publication on the campus at that time. The magazine was given the rare privilege of its own building on the UC Berkeley campus in 1957 after Earle C. Anthony donated money to the university to provide a home for the publication he had created. Although the structure beside Strawberry Creek is now occupied by the Graduate Student Assembly, the prominence of pelicans in architect Joseph Esherick's design as well as Irene Rich's larger-than-life pelican sculpture on the front lawn leave no doubt as to Anthony Hall's original purpose. Still exhibiting the sense of humor that had led to the magazine's founding more than a half-century before, Anthony fittingly arranged for a live pelican at the dedicatory ceremonies over which Berkeley Chancellor Clark Kerr presided.Garff B. Wilson, The Unidentified Man on the Right (Berkeley: Garff B Wilson, 1986), 103-104 The 1960s were especially difficult times for the Pelican and marked the beginning of a long period of turmoil and changes of directions in the publication's history. As the Free Speech Movement flourished at Berkeley in the mid-decade and students‚Äô minds turned to more serious matters, there seemed little place for a humor magazine. After struggling for several years, the Old Girl finally succumbed, the October 1970 number being the last in the traditional humorous format. By the spring of that college year, The New California Pelican emerged, adopting a feature or variety format that did not, however, necessarily exclude humor. The opening editorial explained, ‚ÄúThe old PELICAN has waddled on unsteady legs since around 1963, and this fall, the last editors quietly packed up their negatives of Miss Pelly Girls and left. This issue of the NEW CALIFORNIA PELICAN was put out on short notice by some graduates in the School of Journalism. We had a few suitable pieces from classes; we wrote a few new things, got some art, took some pictures... The point was to keep the bird alive. There has been no continuity between the old PELLY staff and the new.‚ÄùThe New California Pelican, April 1971 (no volume or issue number), 1 With the request to ‚Äúthink of us as a magazine-in-progress,‚Äù a second issue was produced in May 1971 that included a humorous story, ‚ÄúKansas.‚Äù Three quarterly numbers issued during the 1971-1972 academic year under the title California Pelican. An abortive attempt to restore Pelican to its humorous past opened the 1972-1973 academic year. While several members of the editorial board were involved in a voter registration campaign in the south, Business Manager Robert Laubach produced an issue composed of work from the late 1960s, including several cartoons by Joel Beck. Laubach, styling himself as the managing editor, announced that ‚Äúthe Pelican has changed again. Rather than remaining the straight magazine of last year, I have decided to resurrect the old idea of being funny.‚Äù He called for all interested persons who shared his vision to come to an organizational meeting at Pelican Building on November 9, 1972.The California Pelican, Fall 1972, 4 By the time of the meeting, however, Editor-in-Chief Francis Moriarty was back and firmly in control. The three students who appeared in response to Laubach's call were disappointed. Although Monroe McBride took the business manager's post with the Pelican, Cutler Durkee, Don Goff, and he resolved to launch their own humor magazine, The Berkeleyan, which published its inaugural issue in the fall of 1974. Pelican produced a single number in 1972-1973, that in a quarterfold format distributed on campus at no charge. Citing several years of unsustainable red ink, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) acted in May 1973 to cease funding not only Pelican but also the yearbook, Blue and Gold, and the venerable literary magazine, Occident.Christine Weicher, ‚ÄúASUC Kills Student Journals.‚Äù Daily Californian, May 17, 1973, 1; ‚ÄúThree Publications Lose Funding.‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, May 18, 1973, 6 Seeing that the ASUC was willing to fund new publications (The Berkeleyan had received funding in the next year's budget), the editors of the three defunded publications proposed a merger, the new journal to feature the principal elements of its predecessors. The ASUC accepted this alternative at the expense of The Berkeleyan, which declined to participate in the merger. Rescued from extinction, the joint publication never issued, while Occident found another source of funds and withdrew from the arrangement. Under the driving leadership of Professors Josephine Miles and Leonard Michaels, English, and Bernard Taper, Journalism, a new ASUC publications committee took a firm hand and, among other things, restored Pelican‚Äôs funding as a feature magazine.‚ÄúLiterary Publications Board Formed,‚Äù Daily Californian, April 4, 1974; ‚ÄúLiterary Mags Will Publish Again,‚Äù Daily Californian, May 1, 1974 Issues appeared on a regular, quarterly basis starting in the fall of 1974. Although the staff still met, planned, and worked, it did not produce another number after the fall of 1975. Pelican became dormant again in June 1976. Revival One last revival remained. Early in 1978, undergraduate Kevin Sweeney and similarly minded companions formulated plans to bring back Pelican as a humor magazine. On May 24, 1978, they met in Bowles Hall with Sweeney‚Äôs now-graduated Kappa Delta Rho fraternity brother, Monroe McBride ‚Äò76. The Berkeleyan had also become dormant after a financially successful 1975-1976 school year, leaving substantial funds in its trust account with the ASUC. McBride arranged for Sweeney to meet with the few remaining members of The Berkeleyan‚Äôs editorial board and merge the magazines, giving Pelican a more financially sound start than it would have had otherwise. Under the title The Berkeleyan and California Pelican and published by The Berkeleyan Association/California Pelican, the journal reappeared in the fall of 1978 (volume 85:1), shortening its name to The California Pelican starting in the 1979-1980 academic year. The Pelican lasted until 1988, the last volume found in Bancroft Library, when the Old Girl apparently \\"sputtered and died.\\" With its demise the only copies of the Pelican readily accessible can be found in Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and the Southern Regional Library Facility at UCLA. An art book entitled Sweetness and Light has also been published, containing the best art featured in the Pelican from its founding until 1943, as well as photographs of the University of California from 1868 to 1943. Copies of the magazine appear frequently on eBay with most of them in very good condition. A magazine titled \\"The Pelican\\" with a subtitle \\"Magic, Myth and Religion\\" was purchased on eBay and states that it is Volume 81 Number 2. This magazine states that the editorial and business offices were in the Pelican building on the UC Berkeley Campus. The volume number/year scheme is consistent with the volume number scheme throughout the entire California Pelican publication run. References *Sweetness and Light.

The club has a second team, playing in South Division Two.  History  Old letters and poetry show that organised shinty was played in Dalmally in and about 1880. These games were played by teams from each side of the River Orchy for a cup presented by a Mr Macdonald, who had returned from Australia. The contests took place on New Year's Day and continued up to 1932. While the game continued to be played in the district, it was not until 1947 that Glenorchy Camanachd was formed. After a period of some success in the 1950s, a severe shortage of players forced the club to fold in 1960 but it was re-formed in 1965 and has played continuously since then. As a junior team the Munro Shield was won in 1952 and 1959, the Campbell Cup in 1958, the Bullough Cup in 1973 and the Sutherland Cup in 1990. As a senior team the South League Championship was won in 1990. Events which gave satisfaction were the winning of the Munro Shield in 1952, the club's first trophy, the winning of the Bullough Cup in 1973, the first triumph after a period of fifteen years, the winning of the Sutherland Cup and the championship of Division I in 1990. The club won its first senior cup with the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup being raised in 1998. They also won the South First Division Championship in 1999, and achieved Premier league status in the same year with a solid performance in a two leg playoff against Caberfeidh. In 2007, Glenorchy narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League but won the South Division 1 title with 2 games to spare in 2008 to seal their return to the Premier League. Glenorchy's 2nd team also had a good 2008 finishing 2nd in South Division 2. Glenorchy Vs Bute Glenorchy has always been a small but enthusiastic village team which has had a struggle to remain sound financially. Of notable personalities connected with shinty in Glenorchy, there are Donnie MacDougall who got the club going again in 1966 and Mr and Mrs Kenny Campbell who did so much to encourage and coach boys at school. The club supports two junior shinty clubs, at Dalmally and Taynuilt in local first shinty leagues, who come together as Cruachanside to play in National Competition. The club were relegated to South One in 2009 after a season where they lost 13‚Äì0 to Kingussie Camanachd and finished bottom of the league. The club disbanded its second team in 2010. The club bounced back to the Premier with an undefeated championship season in South Division One in 2010. The 2011 was one of unstinting horror at league level with Orchy failing to win a game and not breaching double figures in terms of goals scored. Orchy played in the re-established National Division One in 2014 after finishing third in South Division One in 2013. The club fielded a second team for the first time in several years in 2014. However, the club pulled out of National Division One in 2015 due to feeling they did not have the resources to compete at that level. Difficulties with Park Home games are played at the Mart Park, Dalmally, and there are changing facilities at the Auction Market there. Apart from a pitch at Craig Farm when the Mart pitch was flooded, all home games since 1947 have been played at the Mart Park. The suitability of the stadium for the Premier League was questioned by some in the Premier league as Glenorchy made the step up in 2009. Whether these issues have been addressed for 2011 remained to be seen, but Glenorchy did not suffer as many call-offs as Kyles Athletic and other South clubs.

Previously signed to Fear Dark Records and currently to Whirlwind Records, the group has released five albums, a split-CD with Kekal, a single and a DVD. The second album, The War That Plagues the Lands, reached No. 2 at Lowland's Top 50 Metal Charts. The third album, At the Dawn of War, coincided with the release of a live-DVD, Upon the Fields of Battle, a maxi single for \\"Thunder of War\\", and was named one of HM Magazine \\"100 best Christian metal albums of all time\\". The band's fifth album, Where Wandering Shadows and Mists Collide, was released on December 20, 2016. History =Falconry= Frontman Shamgar at Fear Dark Fest 2008 Slechtvalk began as a solo project in 1997 by singer/guitarist Shamgar, formerly of Ascension and Mordax. The project was first called Dommer (1999‚Äì2000), before Shamgar finally settled on Slechtvalk. The debut album, Falconry, was released in 2000 by the now-defunct Dutch label Fear Dark which had bands such as Eluveitie, Royal Anguish, Taketh and Kekal on its roster. Falconry was received positively, and Dutch metal magazines such as Aardschok interviewed Shamgar. As a result of this exposure, Shamgar was in the position to form a band, and was joined by soprano singer Fionnghuala, folk singer and rhythm guitarist Ohtar (also with Dutch folk metal band Heidevolk), bassist Nath, drummer Grimbold, keyboardist Sorgier, and dancer Meall√°. =The War That Plagues the Lands= Guitarist Seraph, Occultfest 2010 In 2002, Slechtvalk released their second full-length album, The War That Plagues the Lands. As a teaser they first released a split CD with Kekal from Indonesia (also signed on Fear Dark); each band recorded four songs and a cover (Slechtvalk covered Antestor's \\"Kongsblod\\", from The Return of the Black Death). The War That Plagues the Lands was well received. =At the Dawn of War= Premnath at Occultfest 2010 In 2005, the band released their third album, At the Dawn of War, with a more symphonic sound and elements of folk metal. The band also incorporated more war and fantasy themes to their live shows and began dressing in medieval warrior costumes. That same year Slechtvalk released a live-DVD, Upon the Fields of Battle, filmed at the club Hedon Zwolle; a music video for \\"Thunder of War\\" (also released as a maxi single) received some airplay at local music channels. The band toured several European countries with Frosthardr. In 2010, HM Magazine listed At the Dawn of War as number 60 on its \\"100 best Christian metal albums of all time\\". During early 2006 the band was joined by Grimbold's brother Seraph as a guitarist, as Ohtar was not able to continue playing the guitars due to a chronic wrist injury. In July 2006, Fionnghuala left the group to focus on her classical music career. Slechtvalk began writing new material and announced that the music would take a more technical and brutal approach. In February 2007, the bassist Nath was removed from the line-up: Ohtar, who was able to play again, picked up on bass. In late 2007, keyboard-player Hydrith announced his departure to focus more on his family. Since then, Slechtvalk performed without keyboards (playing their more extreme songs) or with session- musicians. =A Forlorn Throne= On April 2009, the band signed with German- based Whirlwind Records. In October 2009, Whirlwind released a compilation album of the band's past material titled An Era of Bloodshed with two unreleased promotional songs. Nath‚Äînow known as Premnath‚Äîre-joined the band as a keyboard-player. The band did a European tour to promote the new album. The tour came to life through financial support from fans, for which the band asked via SellaBand.com. The band went to Sweden's Studio Mega in late 2009 with producer Johan \\"the ant\\" √ñrnborg to record their fourth full-length album titled A Forlorn Throne. It was mixed and mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street, and the cover artwork as well as a new logo was designed by Raymond Swanland. =Where Wandering Shadows and Mists Collide = In 2014, the band released pre-orders for their upcoming album. After that there was no more information until 2016, when the band released a lyric video for the new song \\"We Are\\", announcing the album, Where Wandering Shadows and Mists Collide, would be released on December the 20th of the same year. The Metal Archives concluded their review of the album with ‚ÄúIt partly slays, but can also get so darn generic‚Äù and gave it a rating of 67%. This is in line with Metal Exposures rating of 7 out of 10. Festivals In addition to local shows in the Netherlands, Slechtvalk has appeared at several heavy metal music festivals such as Elements of Rock in Switzerland, Bobfest in Sweden, Nordic Fest in Norway, and Interregnum Fest in Germany.

He also served as Primary Industries Minister in the government of Wayne Goss between 1989 and 1995. Casey was the member for Mackay in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland between 1969 and 1995. Early life and career Of Irish Catholic background, Casey started his working life as a bank clerk before entering his family's construction business. He was active in local government, becoming deputy mayor of the City of Mackay. Shortly before the 1969 election, he won Labor Party preselection for the seat of Mackay in the state parliament. He lost preselection for the Labor Party in 1972, after opposing the then dominant, left-wing faction in Trades Hall. But he was re- elected twice without Labor Party endorsement, as an independent Labor candidate, for example running under the banner of 'The True Labor Party'.[John Wanna and Tracey Arklay, The Ayes Have It: the History of the Queensland Parliament 1957-1989, pp 326 and 474] Leader of the ALP Casey was readmitted to the Labor caucus in 1977. In November 1978 he became Labor leader, replacing Tom Burns who had resigned unexpectedly.Encyclopedia of Australian Events 1978, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd He led Labor into the 1980 election but failed to achieve more than a small swing against the Coalition Government led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and as a result his own authority within the state ALP was diminished. Casey made an offer to the Queensland Liberal Party after the 1980 election to form a bipartisan alliance, with the aim of opposing the electoral malapportionment from which Bjelke-Petersen benefited, and of putting in its place a system of one-vote- one-value. Relations between the Liberals and the National Party in the Coalition were poor, with the Liberal Party being disadvantaged (though less severely than the ALP) by the prevailing pro-National gerrymander. Casey renewed his offer in 1982 when relations within the Coalition were still bad, but the offer was again rebuffed, despite a Liberal Convention in June voting against the existing electoral system. The following October, Casey lost the ALP leadership to Keith Wright. Minister Casey remained popular in his electorate, despite no longer being party leader, and was re-elected comfortably in both the 1983 and the 1986 elections. By 1986, the popularity of the National Party had declined and the Coalition with the Liberals had acrimoniously ended. In late 1989 the ALP won its first Queensland election for 32 years. Wayne Goss thus became the new Premier, after the Fitzgerald Inquiry had uncovered serious problems with corruption in the Queensland police force. Goss appointed Casey as his Primary Industries Minister. In this role, Casey reformed the sugar industry, established agricultural academies, and set up a drought relief task force. But his health had declined, with diabetes having aggravated his long-standing weight problems, and in 1995 he resigned from both the ministry and the parliament. He died of a stroke on 1 May 2006. While Casey never became premier, and spent in opposition many of what should have been his most productive years, he remained a very popular member of his seat of Mackay. At the last election which he contested (1992), he achieved the rare feat of winning every single voting booth in the constituency.

That same year he also worked with John Corigliano, John Harbison, and George Rochberg at a program for young composers. Hersch then returned to Peabody for graduate studies, where he currently serves as Chair of the composition department.Peabody Conservatory of Music, faculty, department of composition . =Early recognition= His first success came when Marin Alsop selected Hersch's Elegy as winner of the American Composers Prize, and conducted it at Lincoln Center in New York in 1997. That year also saw Hersch awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Music Composition. He has also been a fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center, where he studied under Christopher Rouse, the Norfolk Festival for Contemporary Music, and the Pacific Music Festival in Sapporo, Japan. In 2000, Hersch was awarded the Rome Prize, in 2001 the Berlin Prize. While in Europe Hersch worked with Hans Werner Henze and Luciano Berio. Other honors include the Charles Ives Scholarship (1996) and the Goddard Lieberson Fellowship (2006) from the American Academy of Arts & Letters. Hersch's earliest recordings appeared on the Vanguard Classics label, the first released in 2003, with performances by the composer and the String Soloists of the Berlin Philharmonic. This was followed by two other Vanguard discs. The second, with Hersch performing his own work in addition to music of Morton Feldman, Wolfgang Rihm, and Josquin des Prez, was selected by The Washington Post and Newsday as among the notable recordings of 2004-05.Tim Page, CD review, The Washington Post, November 25, 2005.

Life Andr√© Fleury was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. He received his musical training as a private student of Henri Letocart (a former student of C√©sar Franck), and later, of Andr√© Marchal and Louis Vierne. At the Paris Conservatory, he studied organ with Eug√®ne Gigout and received a first prize in organ performance and improvisation under Gigout's successor, Marcel Dupr√©, in 1926. Fleury also studied composition with Paul Vidal. In 1920, Fleury became Gigout's assistant at St. Augustin in Paris, and, later, also assistant of Charles Tournemire at Ste. Clotilde. He became titular organist at St. Augustin in 1930. In 1941, he was appointed professor of organ at the √âcole Normale de Musique in Paris. After World War II, Fleury and his wife left Paris due to health reasons, and relocated to Dijon. In 1949, he succeeded √âmile Poillot as titular organist at Dijon Cathedral and as professor of piano (a year later also of organ) at the Dijon Conservatory. In 1971, he accepted Jean Guillou‚Äôs invitation to become co-titular organist at Saint-Eustache in Paris. He also was appointed as professor of organ at the Schola Cantorum and as titular organist at Versailles Cathedral, this duty was taken over by Francis Vidil after his death. Andr√© Fleury died in 1995 at Le V√©sinet, France, age 92, and was buried in Arcy-sur-Cure. As a composer, Fleury wrote numerous works for organ, many of which have not been published yet, however. He also performed extensively throughout Europe. Andr√© Fleury premiered several important organ compositions, such as the organ sonata of Darius Milhaud, Maurice Durufl√©‚Äôs Scherzo op. 2, as well as La Nativit√© du Seigneur by Olivier Messiaen (the first integral performance of this organ cycle, after the premiere by Jean Langlais, Jean-Yves Daniel-Lesur, and Jean-Jacques Grunenwald). Among his students were Bernard Gavoty, Pierre Cochereau, and Daniel-Lesur.

Produced by Surinder Kapoor and Boney Kapoor, it stars his son Anil Kapoor along with Padmini Kolhapure and Naseeruddin Shah. It was Anil Kapoor's first lead role in a Hindi movie. The film is a remake of the 1981 Tamil film Andha 7 Naatkal, which was directed by K. Bhagyaraj. Director Bapu remade the film in Telugu first and then in Hindi. The music was done by Laxmikant Pyarelal while Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics.  Synopsis  Maya (played by Padmini Kolhapure) attempts suicide on the day of her nuptial night. Dr. Anand (played by Naseeruddin Shah), Maya's husband, who is a doctor, treats her, and finds out that she attempted suicide. When Maya gains consciousness, she confirms her secret to Dr. Anand: She didn't want to get married and was forced.

He has also recorded and toured with Anthrax, Sebastian Bach and Marya Roxx. Biography Growing up in Green Brook Township, New Jersey, he started playing guitar at the age of 10 when his parents (Dennis & Carol) bought him a basic acoustic as a Christmas gift.Lamberg, Erica. \\"Green Brook people\\", Courier News, May 19, 2004. Accessed March 28, 2011. \\"Crook, 38, was raised in Green Brook and said much of his spare time growing up was spent playing guitar.\\" Crook took to the guitar quickly and found himself practicing hours-on-end. His father, after seeing this for a few years, then bought him his first \\"real\\" guitar: a black Gibson Les Paul Custom. Professional career Years later Crook teamed up with Jack Secret (aka Tony Geranios), the keyboard tech for Rush. They wrote and recorded several songs together. Some of which were Produced by Alex Lifeson at Electric Lady Studios, in New York City. Secret introduced Crook to the members of Blue √ñyster Cult (BOC), who took Crook out on the road in 1986 as a keyboard/guitar tech. While in Germany with BOC, Crook met Bernie Marsden of Whitesnake fame. The two began to work together, writing and recording in the United Kingdom. In 1989 Crook met Anthrax through Rick Downey. Crook became guitar tech for Dan Spitz, and, in 1995, replaced Spitz (although not an official member). Crook toured with Anthrax for the rest of the decade and performed on two records, Stomp 442 and Volume 8: The Threat Is Real, which he also co-produced and engineered. In 1999, Sebastian Bach of Skid Row fame asked Crook to join his band. They did shows together, touring around the world until 2004. Their only recording was \\"Rock Bottom\\", on a KISS tribute record. In 1999 Crook teamed up with Glenn Hughes. Together, they composed the ballad \\"Feels Like Home\\" for Glenn's solo record Building The Machine. In 2000 Crook teamed up with Scott Metaxas from Prophet and Nuclear Assault fame. The two of them Co-produced Billy Milano's M.O.D. record The Rebel You Love to Hate. In 2003 Kasim Sulton asked Crook to join Meat Loaf's Neverland Express. Crook appeared in the music video \\"Couldn't Have Said It Better Myself\\" and then hit the road for a long world tour including television appearances. A live DVD was filmed at the end of the tour (in Australia): Bat out of Hell: Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. In 2004 Crook auditioned for the musical We Will Rock You, featuring the music of Queen. He had to audition for Brian May, one of his main influences. May trained Crook personally for the position. Crook relocated to Las Vegas to perform his favorite Queen songs. After a 16-month run the show moved to Toronto, Canada. To this day Crook remains in Las Vegas and still calls it his home. In 2006 Crook hit the studio with Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express to record Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. The album was produced by Desmond Child. While touring Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose a camera crew was called in to record every move the band made. This footage later became known as the documentary film: Meat Loaf In Search Of Paradise. In 2007 (while on a tour break) Crook received a text message from famed producer Kevin Shirley, who asked Crook to play on a heavy metal record for Marya Roxx. Shirley assembled a solid band: Crook (guitars), Scott Metaxas (bass), Derek Sherinian (keys) and Brian Tichy (drums). They re-wrote and recorded 12 songs in 10 days at The Document Room in Malibu, California. 2008 brought Crook out on the road for Meat Loaf's Casa De Carne tour. 2009 was a very busy year. After a tour of Europe with Marya Roxx, Crook jumped back in the studio with Meat Loaf. This time Rob Cavallo was called in to produce. They began recording on June 1 in Calabasas, California. Many stellar musicians were brought in to create the massive sound. Sharing guitar duties alongside Crook were Brian May, Steve Vai, Justin Hawkins, Randy Flowers and Tim Pierce. While recording Meat Loaf's Hang Cool, Teddy Bear album Crook was asked by Rob Cavallo to record on a song with Adam Lambert from American Idol fame. The song was \\"Time for Miracles\\". It was released and went to #9 on iTunes. \\"Time for Miracles\\" was a part of the motion picture soundtrack for 2012. In 2010 Meat Loaf asked Crook to produce the album Hell In A Handbasket. The album was released on September 30, 2011. Crook spent most of 2011/2012 on the road with Meat Loaf. Meat Loaf asked Crook to mix the Guilty Pleasure Tour, Live From Sydney. In early 2013 Meat Loaf and Crook began song editing and video creation for the Last At Bat Tour. All of the video media used in the show was put together by the two of them. The tour mounted in April, 2013 and took them through the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. The Last At Bat Tour is considered to be Meat Loaf's greatest tour to date. After the Last At Bat Tour, Crook began working with Meat Loaf on song arrangements and video production for a Las Vegas residency... Rocktellz And Cocktails had a successful 26-week run at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. Summer 2014, Crook began production work on Meat Loaf's upcoming album Braver Than We Are. While on break from recording Braver Than We Are, Crook began production for Frank DiMino's album Old Habits Die Hard. It was released on Frontiers Records in July 2015. July, 2015 Crook found himself back in the studio with Meat Loaf, recording vocals on Braver Than We Are. A majority of the work was done during an 11-week period in a rental house just outside of Nashville. Vocal overdubs and mixing were completed in Las Vegas (December 2015 - February 2016). Release date is slated for September, 2016. Crook continues to tour with Meat Loaf. Work *Meat Loaf: \\"Braver Than We Are\\" Produced, Engineered, Performed and Mixed.

Originally built for the Dublin International Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures of 1865, the structure was converted into the central building of University College Dublin (UCD) at the foundation of the National University of Ireland in 1908. When UCD began to relocate to a new campus at Belfield in the 1960s, part of the building was converted, and reopened as the NCH in 1981. Since then, the structure has been shared with UCD. In 2005 it was announced that UCD is to relocate all of its faculties to Belfield in the near term, allowing the NCH to develop a major expansion plan on the entire site, bringing it in line with international peers. Today the NCH is one of Ireland's National Cultural Institutions, under the aegis of the Irish Government's Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and, as such, is grant-aided by the Irish Government. The NCH is a statutory corporate body, with a management team, and a Government-appointed Board. In 2011, the National Concert Hall celebrated its 30th Anniversary Development plans Although its facade is quite impressive, the venue's acoustics have been criticized . It is also unsuitable for large-scale opera stagings, lacking full stage facilities. Consequently, calls for a purpose-built venue are made from time to time. Plans have been developed in the early 2000s which involve revamping the existing Auditorium, building a larger newer one plus another small auditorium. This comes after the UCD section was bought from the college to enlarge the Concert Hall. Finances The National Concert Hall generally makes a small surplus, unlike most of Ireland's National Cultural Institutions. This is despite the fact that although it has a high level of attendance, it has only a small public funding element, especially compared to the Abbey Theatre. Performances, repertoire and performing groups Due to its central location, lunchtime concerts and recitals are common and attended by many workers from nearby office buildings. In summer, outdoor recitals are given in the adjacent Iveagh Gardens. =Orchestras= The resident orchestra is the RT√â National Symphony Orchestra. Other regular performances are made from the rest of the RT√â Performing Groups. Presently, the NCH has three performance areas. =Performance areas= * The Main Auditorium, seating 1,200, is used for large scale concerts and some operas. :The Hall was converted from use as an examination hall when the building was the headquarters of UCD. :There is a magnificent concert organ set as a background to the stage, which was designed to complement the surrounding :architecture of the Hall and installed in 1991 in time for the 10th anniversary of the NCH's opening. :The stage area is considered small, making large opera performances impossible at the NCH. (Therefore, they usually have to be accommodated in one of the city's other venues like The Point Theatre or \\"the theatre\\" in The Helix, which by contrast has one of the largest stages in Ireland). * The John Field Room, seating 250, is used for small scale recitals and as an exhibition space. * The Carolan Room, seating 100, is used for pre- event talks, receptions and corporate functions. * Other facilities: There is a box office in the foyer, a small bistro, a bar on the first floor, and temporary cloakroom and bar facilities are operated on the ground floor in the inner lobby for performances. =Organ= The organ in the NCH was installed by the organ builders Kenneth Jones and Associates in 1991, ten years after the auditorium was built. It features prominently in various performances at the NCH. It is one of the largest organs in Ireland with 4 manuals and 50 stops. One of the notable features of the organ is the magnificent State Trumpet, a horizontal reed stop that faces out into the auditorium. See also * The Helix, opened in 2002 and located on the campus of Dublin City University, is a rival performance space in Dublin. The main auditorium, the Mahony Hall, is a purpose built 1,260-seater concert hall and its acoustics are said to be superior to those of the National Concert Hall. * List of concert halls External links * National Concert Hall, Dublin website Buildings and structures in Dublin (city) Concert halls in the Republic of Ireland Tourist attractions in Dublin (city) World's fair architecture in Europe ","title":"National Concert Hall"},{"id":"4980433","text":"Edgar Township is one of fifteen townships in Edgar County, Illinois, USA.

By consolidating individual landowning farmers into agricultural co-operatives, the Communist government hoped to increase production and efficiency, and put agriculture under the control of the state. Post-War background In early 1945, the provisional Hungarian government had appointed ‚Äúland claimants‚Äù committees to examine the situation of the peasantry and develop a plan for land reform. When the proposed legislation was passed in March, it merely acknowledged the seizures the peasants had already undertaken. Prior to the reforms, half of agricultural land had controlled by large, privately owned ‚Äúhacienda-type‚Äù estates. The provisional government legislation redistributed 35% of Hungary's territory, some 93,000 square kilometers of land. While the wealthy who lost their land in the deal had obviously lost out, the problems of smaller peasant landholders were by no means solved. Many of them saw only slight increases in their property size to 11,000 square meters, ‚Äútoo small to provide a livelihood, let alone the basis for efficient agricultural production.‚Äù These smallholders formed a political party which won a significant majority in the November election, but political maneuvering and election fraud by the Communists led to its failure in the following election. First attempt at collectivization While it remains unclear how the Smallholders Party would have solved the problems resulting from their dwarf properties, the plans of the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) soon became clear. The model of Stalinist collectivization would be adopted and applied with physical force if necessary. In July 1948, government regulations allowed the seizure of larger landholdings from nagygazd√°k (Hungarian [kulak]s). These regulations enabled over 800 square kilometers of land to be confiscated, 60% of which went to recently formed farming co-operatives, the rest going to private peasants. This first serious attempt at collectivization corresponded with the first Five Year Plan, and both bore the marks of Stalinist agricultural policy. Both economic and direct police pressure were used to coerce peasants to join co- operatives, but large numbers opted instead to leave their villages. In the early 1950s, only one quarter of peasants agreed to join co-operatives. Even once collectivized, farms were subject to harsh compulsory deliveries (production quotas in physical units passed down from central planning) and incredibly low agricultural producer prices. Although individual families were allowed a small private household plot intended to serve their own personal needs, decrees passed in 1949 and 1950 limited these plots with an absolute limit of 4,300 square meters, and its output was also subject to compulsory deliveries. The Five Year Plan initially promised 11 billion forints of credit for co-operatives (later downscaled to 8 million) but by 1953, less than half of that had been made available. Without credit from the government, or any reasonable ability to earn a surplus, peasants were unable to invest in their own farms and the co-operatives began to crumble. Nagy's New Course and R√°kosi's return Although certainly not radical, Imre Nagy's ‚ÄúNew Course,‚Äù introduced in 1954, promised an easing of social tension between co-operatives and the state. First, the compulsory deliveries were abolished, alleviating much stress for farmers. Second, the government devoted nearly one quarter of its national investment to agriculture and in just one year ‚Äúmore tractors were put into service than during the entire 1950-3 period.‚Äù These new beginnings would not last long, however, as power struggles within the MDP in the spring of 1955 led to M√°ty√°s R√°kosi's return to power and a condemnation of the ‚Äúright deviation‚Äù supported in the Nagy's New Course. R√°kosi renewed the drive for collectivization, again using physical force to encourage membership. This attempt failed to last even as long as the previous drive. Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech and R√°kosi's ensuing resignation led to second failure at collectivization. The weaknesses in the Stalinist model had been rather apparent to some after the first wave in the early 1950s, but the inflexibility of the R√°kosi government left no room for any creative solutions. 1957 Agrarian Theses After the events of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the re-establishment of political order, officials of the new Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (MSzMP) began to draw up a plan for a more gradual collectivization drive. Like Nagy's New Course, the changes suggested in the July 1957 Agrarian Theses were not drastic, but they made room for the possibility of further reforms. Some changes came almost immediately. The compulsory deliveries were not reintroduced and the purchasing prices introduced in 1957 were 80% higher than the compulsory prices had been. =Tractors and machine stations= The government began to allow the co- operatives to purchase limited amounts of machinery for their own use. Until this point, all farm machinery had been kept in special state-run machine stations, but new regulations encouraged co-operatives to buy most forms of light machinery. By the end of the year, the 2557 existing agricultural co- operatives had purchased over 1000 light tractors. In March 1958, Khrushchev suggested that machine stations had outlived their usefulness, and they were soon abolished. More purchasing of machinery was allowed the following year, and in 1961, a number of machine stations were allowed to sell off their obsolete machines. Furthermore, the machine stations in Turkeve and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r were converted into repair shops. Out of 235 machine stations in use in 1961, only 63 were open in 1964 and by the end of the decade, only a few remained in poor areas. Most of the stations were transformed into repair shops to service the machinery quickly being acquired by the co-operatives. The new independent machine ownership would later spawn further demands by the collective farmers. =Household plots and sharecropping= Another shift that resulted from the Agrarian Theses was a new willingness on the part of Party to accept household plots belonging to members of co-operative farms. The acceptance of household plots grew primarily out of necessity; the infrastructure required to shelter livestock co-operatively could simply not be built quickly enough. The government adopted the common-sense solution of allowing members to keep animals on their household plots. The solution was a good fit. The farmers enjoyed the benefits of keeping their own animals (including milk, eggs, even calves and piglets) and the government avoided the unnecessary slaughter of animals that would have resulted from strict enforcement. Although the household plots had long existed, the idea of household stock-breeding was not approved of by everyone. In 1959, a report to the Political Committee worried that in some areas, local farm leaders continued to oppose the creation of household plots and made life difficult for those private owners. Government attempts push for tolerance of their measures stressed the ‚Äútransitional‚Äù nature of the situation. In the summer of 1960, Lajos Feh√©r, Deputy Prime Minister, insisted that \\"...[h]ousehold farming is an integral complementary part of cooperative farming ... It will be needed so long as the economic activity of the co-operative ... has not reached a high enough level for collective production to take over the supply . . . In many places the transitional measures are being branded in a sectarian manner as 'capitalist tendencies' or regarded as some sort of 'sin or act against socialism' ... These damaging, narrow-minded ideas must now be forcefully eliminated, and everybody must understand ... the country needs meat!\\" Also allowed was the practice of sharecropping, in which co-operatively owned land was divided up between families and worked on relatively independently. The family would receive pay based on their work hours but also a percentage of the surplus from their particular strip of land. This helped to motivate members to work harder, particularly with crops like potatoes that required more manual labor. Both of these transitional measures integrated pre-soviet ‚Äúfamily labor‚Äù practices with the ideal ‚Äúsocialist wage labor‚Äù to balance ideology with economic well-being. Resistance With relatively little use of force, the great wave of collectivization occurred between 1959 and 1961, earlier than forecast in the Agrarian Theses. At the end of this period, more than 95% of agricultural land in Hungary had become the property of collective farms. In February 1961, the Central Committee declared that collectivization had been completed. This quick success should not be confused with enthusiastic adoption of collective idealism on the part of the peasants. Private ownership meant independence and self-sufficiency, collectivization meant negotiation and uncertainty. Although pensions for members of co- operatives were a legal requirement after 1958, some elderly potential members were not convinced of the long-term financial security of co-operatives, and chose to leave their farms to seek industrial work where they were sure of a pension. In the end, however, psychological factors might have been the deciding influence. Demoralized after two successive (and harsh) collectivization campaigns and the events of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the peasants were less interested in resisting, and as membership levels increased, those who remained likely grew worried about being left out. Benefits Whether or not peasants really wanted to join, the adjustments made to the agricultural system in 1957 clearly managed to satisfy the membership adequately enough that the co-operatives did not fall apart as they had in the past. Like Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia underwent a Stalinist phase of collectivization in the 1950s before leaving it behind in the search for a new model. In Poland, a sort of ‚Äúdual agricultural‚Äù model was developed in which 20% of land was controlled by large, inefficient state farms, and the rest privately owned, mostly in the form of small peasant farms. This isolated situation left the peasants open to obvious discrimination and they suffered from a lack of financial and structural support from the state. In Czechoslovakia, the state had only a bare tolerance for household plots and the transitional system was marked by its almost total inflexibility. In contrast, transitional measures in Hungary worked with the concerns of the farmers, allowing them mechanical independence, semi-private production on their household plots and crop-shared fields, and a decent standard of living from higher agricultural producer prices and substantial government investment. By 1989, Hungary's total annual agricultural output was larger than that of France.

Numerous carnivals feature this ride which is known as Alpha One Peeters and Vertical Limits. Design and operation The UFO consists of twelve, four-person gondolas, mounted in a circle around a central drive hub. This hub is in turn connected to a hydraulic arm. The ride is rotated to produce enough centrifugal force to stick the riders to the wall of the gondola furthest from the centre. Once this is achieved, the hydraulic arm is used to move the entire ride from the horizontal position to near-vertical. The time between the ride beginning to spin and the ride reaching near-vertical is approximately sixty seconds. The ride must be lowered back to the horizontal position before the rotation can cease. There are no safety restraints on the UFO; the centrifugal force is strong enough to prevent riders from experiencing any major movement while the ride is not at horizontal, and in the event of a rotational or power failure, the size and spacing of the bars that make up the gondola 'cage' (along with enforced height and safety restrictions), prevents riders from falling out. Nevertheless, minimum rider height requirement is usually or taller, as much as some extreme roller coasters.

Beginning in 1602, the conflict primarily involved the Dutch companies invading Portuguese colonies in the Americas, Africa, India and the Far East. The war can be thought of as an extension of the Eighty Years' War being fought in Europe at the time between Spain and the Netherlands, as Portugal was in a dynastic union with the Spanish Crown after the War of the Portuguese Succession, for most of the conflict. However, the conflict had little to do with the war in Europe and served mainly as a way for the Dutch to gain an overseas empire and control trade at the cost of the Portuguese. English forces also assisted the Dutch at certain points in the war (though in later decades, English and Dutch would become fierce rivals). Because of the commodity at the center of the conflict, this war would be nicknamed the Spice War. The outcome was that Portugal successfully repelled Dutch attempts to secure Brazil and Angola while the Dutch were the victors in the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies, with the exception of Macau which the Portuguese retained, capturing Malacca, Ceylon, the Malabar Coast and the Moluccas. English ambitions also greatly benefited from the long-standing war between their two main rivals in the Far East (beginning in the late 18th to early 19th century Malacca, Ceylon and Malabar would become British possessions). Portuguese resentment at Spain, which was perceived as having prioritized its own colonies and neglected the defense of the Portuguese ones, was a major contributing factor to Portugal shaking off Spanish rule in the Portuguese Restoration War, conducted simultaneously with the later stages of the war with the Dutch. Introduction The war lasted from 1602 to 1663, and the main participants were the Kingdom of Portugal and the Republic of the Seven United Provinces. Following the 1580 Iberian Union, Portugal was throughout most of the period under Habsburg rule, and the Habsburg Philip II of Spain was battling the Dutch Revolt. Prior to the union of the Portuguese and Spanish Crowns, Portuguese merchants used the Low Countries as a base for the sale of their spices in northern Europe. After the Spaniards gained control of the Portuguese Empire though, they declared an embargo on all trade with the rebellious provinces (see Union of Utrecht). In his efforts to subdue the rebelling provinces, Philip II cut off the Netherlands from the spice markets of Lisbon, making it necessary for the Dutch to send their own expeditions to the sources of these commodities and to take control of the Indies spice trade. Like the French and English, the Dutch worked to create a global trade network at the expense of the Iberian kingdoms. The Dutch Empire attacked many territories in Asia under the rule of the Portuguese and Spanish including Formosa, Ceylon, the Philippine Islands, and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (Mina), and South America. Background In 1592, during the war with Spain, an English fleet had captured a large Portuguese galleon off the Azores, the Madre de Deus, loaded with 900 tons of merchandise from India and China, worth an estimated half a million pounds (nearly half the size of English Treasury at the time). This foretaste of the riches of the East galvanized interest in the region.‚ÄòThe Presence of the \\"Portugals\\" in Macau and Japan in Richard Hakluyt's Navigations ‚Äô, Rog√©rio Miguel Puga, Bulletin of Portuguese/Japanese Studies, vol. 5, December 2002, pp. 81‚Äì116. That same year, Dutch merchants sent Cornelis de Houtman to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the Spice Islands. In 1595, merchant and explorer Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, having traveled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the \\"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\\" (\\"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East\\").Van Linschoten, Jan Huyghen.

New Delhi, AES, 2004, xxiv, 126 p., $11. . The published report included vast directions on how to navigate ships between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. Dutch and British interest fed by new information led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of the English East India Company, in 1600, and Dutch East India Company (VOC), in 1602, allowing the entry of chartered companies in the so-called East Indies. In 1602, the VOC was founded, with the goal of sharing the costs of the exploration of the East Indies and ultimately re-establishing the spice trade, a vital source of income to the new Republic of the Seven United Provinces. Map of the Dutch and Portuguese Empires following the war. Blue: Dutch Republic. Green: Portugal. The need of founding the VOC arose because, with the war with Spain and Portugal being united to Spain, the trade would now be directed through the southern low countries (roughly present-day Belgium), which according to the Union of Arras (or Union of Atrecht) were pledged to the Spanish monarch and were Roman Catholic, as opposed to the Dutch Protestant north. This also meant that the Dutch had lost their most profitable trade partner and their most important source of financing the war against Spain. Additionally, the Dutch would lose their distribution monopoly with France, the Holy Roman Empire and northern Europe. Their North Sea fishing and Baltic cereal trading activities would simply not suffice to maintain the republic. The Portuguese Empire in the Indian Ocean was a traditional thalassocracy that had extended its reach to every major choke point in the ocean. Trade in the area corresponded also to a traditional triangular model whereupon small manufactures would be brought from Europe and traded in Africa for gold and several items, then these would serve to purchase spices in India proper which were then brought back to Europe and traded at immense profit which would be reinvested into ships and troops, to be sent eastwards. The Portuguese State of India, headquartered in Goa, was a network of key cities which controlled the maritime trade in the Indian Ocean: Sofala was the base for Portuguese operations in East Africa and was supported by Kilwa to better control the Mozambique Channel; from here, the routes took the trade to Goa which was the hub for the rest of the operations and where the India Convoy ships out of Europe arrived; from Goa, going northwards, the trade would be protected by the North and Adventurers Fleets all the way to Daman and Diu which oversaw the northern trade and the Gulf of Cambay; while the Fleet of the North escorted merchant ships the Adventurers Fleet would also seek to disrupt the Mecca trade between northern India's Muslims and the Arabian Peninsula; the Diu Fleet would then connect the trade to Hormuz which controlled the Persian Gulf routes and interrupted the Basrah-Suez trade; southwards from Goa, the Cape Comorin Fleet would escort the Goa merchants to Calicut and Cochin in the Malabar Coast and to Ceylon and the connection to the Bay of Bengal; in the Bay of Bengal, the most lucrative trade was in the Coromandel Coast where such settlements as S√£o Tom√© of Mylapore and Pulicat served as hubs; it was in the Coromandel and Ceylon settlements where the ships out of the Malacca route often laid anchor because they connected the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea; the Malacca Fleet patrolled the Singapore Strait and the routes diverted to Celebes and what is now Indonesia at large in the south, and northwards to China and Japan; China provided silk and china to Macau from where the 'Silver Carrack' connected to Japan where several products were exchanged for Japanese silver.Saturnino Monteiro (2011) Portuguese Sea Battles Volume V =Casus belli= At dawn of February 25, 1603 three ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) seized the Santa Catarina, a Portuguese galleon. It was such a rich prize that its sale proceeds doubled the capital of the VOC. The legality of keeping the prize was questionable under Dutch statute and the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo. The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. As a result, Hugo Grotius in The Free Sea (Mare Liberum, published 1609) formulated the new principle that the sea was international territory, against the Portuguese mare clausum policy, and all nations were free to use it for seafaring trade. The 'free seas' provided suitable ideological justification for the Dutch to break Portuguese monopoly through its formidable naval power. Insertion in the East: Batavia challenges Goa Battle for Malacca between the VOC fleet and the Portuguese, 1606. Portugal's Indian Ocean empire relied on three strategic bases: Goa, Malacca and Macau. The first connected the State of India with Portugal proper, the second connected Goa to the Pacific Ocean trade stretching from the China seas to Australasia, and the third was the hub for the trade with China and Japan. Two other cities were important but not crucial: Diu and Hormuz. Diu controlled the Gulf of Cambay and the Arabian Sea approaches and Hormuz was the keystone of the Persian Gulf trade, both between Persia and Arabia and between Mesopotamia and the Arabian Sea. If both Diu and Hormuz fell, that would prevent the Middle East markets from being taxed by Portugal which would deny Lisbon the revenue from the southernmost course of the Silk Route. This was a lucrative trade but not as essential to the Indian Ocean network at large. After the fall of Hormuz to the English and Dutch, the Portuguese striking out of their Muscat and Goa bases, led a destructive campaign against Persia's coastline and allied with the Basrah Ottomans. Eventually, after the Battle of the three islands Persia vied for a cease-fire with the Portuguese to be able to reestablish trade and provided Portugal with a tradepost in Kong. Together with the reestablished Basrah route, this temporarily made up for the loss of Hormuz. The pioneers of the destruction of the Portuguese and Spanish mare clausum doctrine were the Dutch. Sea battle off Goa between the Dutch and Portuguese fleets in 1638 The Dutch East India Company, however, suffered from the same weakness as Portugal: lack of manpower. Thus, a Spanish style colonisation effort was never feasible and only dominion of the seas would allow it to compete. The Portuguese had a century head-start in the region and their empire allowed them access to converted and loyal local populations, which shored-up inland, what naval power could not ensure at sea. Hence, the Dutch directed their efforts to the periphery of the Portuguese empire. Avoiding the Indian coasts, they set up their own headquarters in the southeast Indies, in the city of Jakarta, later known as Batavia. This put them safely distant from Goa but opportunistically close to Malacca and the Indian Ocean ‚Äì Pacific Ocean-connecting sea lanes. Many battles were fought but the most decisive ones fatally injured the Portuguese Indian empire. The Dutch Blockade of Goa between 1604 and 1645 deprived the State of India from a safe connection to Lisbon ‚Äì and Europe ‚Äì for the remainder of the war. The Blockade of Goa The Battle of Carracks Island in 1615 off the coast of Malacca, destroyed Portuguese naval power in the Southeast Indies leading to the loss of naval supremacy to the Dutch, in the crucial route between Goa and Macau. The Battle of Hormuz in 1621/2 against the English East India Company resulted in the loss of the fortress of Hormuz to the combined forces of Persia and England which dislodged the Portuguese from the Middle East. The 1639 expulsion of the Jesuit order (Sakoku) and subsequently the Portuguese, from Nagasaki, also doomed the economic viability of Macau. The Siege of Malacca of 1641, after many attempts, delivered the city to the Dutch and their regional allies, crucially breaking the spinal cord between Goa and the Orient. Portuguese establishments were isolated and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in doing so.Boxer (1969), p. 23. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca, the Battle of Cape Rachado, the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favorable monsoon winds.Boxer (1965), p. 189. In 1607 and 1608, the Dutch twice failed to subdue the Portuguese stronghold on the Island of Mozambique, due to the close cooperation between the locals and the Portuguese. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. For the next forty-four years, the two cities of Goa and Batavia would fight relentlessly, since they stood as the capital of the Portuguese State of India and the Dutch East India Company's base of operations. With the assistance of the Sultanate of Bijapur the Dutch would even attempt to conquer Goa itself, but Portuguese diplomacy defeated this plan. In fact, Goa had been under intermittent blockade since 1603. Most of the fighting took place in west India, where the Dutch Malabar campaign sought to replace the Portuguese monopoly on the spice trade. Dutch and Portuguese fleets faced off for control of the sea lanes as was the case with the Action of 30 September 1639, while on mainland India the war involved more and more Indian kingdoms and principalities as the Dutch capitalised on local resentment of Portuguese conquests in the early 16th century. In 1624, Fernando de Silva led a Spanish fleet to sack a Dutch ship near the Siamese shoreline. This enraged Songtham, King of Siam, whom held the Dutch in great preference and ordered the attacks and seizures of all the Spaniards. War between Philip's possessions and other countries led to a deterioration of the Portuguese Empire, as the loss of Hormuz to Persia, aided by England, but the Dutch Empire was the main beneficiary. In 1640 the Portuguese took advantage of the Catalan Revolt and themselves revolted from the Spanish-dominated Iberian Union. From this point onwards the English decided instead to re- establish their alliance with Portugal. =The VOC gains ground= Kochi and victory of the V.O.C. over the Portuguese in 1663.

With the exception of Jakarta and Deshima, all Dutch settlements had been captured by the Dutch East India Company from Portugal.Boxer (1969), p. 24. Despite the Portuguese proclaiming themselves as hostile to the Spanish crown, the VOC nevertheless took the opportunity to prise away the string of coastal fortresses that comprised the Portuguese Empire: Malacca finally succumbed in 1641. Important battles also took place in the South China sea, initially with combined fleets of Dutch and English vessels, and subsequently exclusively Dutch ships assaulting Macau. Dutch attempts to capture Macau, to force China to replace the Portuguese or to settle the Pescadores failed, in part because of the long-standing diplomacy between the Portuguese and the Ming, but the Dutch were ultimately successful in acquiring the monopoly of trade with Japan. while the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture MacauShipp, p. 22. from where Portugal monopolised the lucrative China‚ÄìJapan trade. The Dutch established a colony at Tayouan in 1624, present-day Anping in the south of Taiwan, known to the Portuguese as Formosa and in 1642 the Dutch took northern Formosa from the Spanish by force. The Dutch intervened in the Sinhalese‚ÄìPortuguese War on Ceylon from 1638 onwards, initially as allies of the Kingdom of Kandy against Portugal. The Dutch conquered Batticaloa in 1639 and Galle in 1640 before the alliance broke down. After a period of triangular warfare between the Dutch, Portuguese and Kandyans, the alliance was remade in 1649. After exploiting and then double-crossing their Kandyan allies, the Dutch were able to capture Colombo in 1656 and drove the last Portuguese from Ceylon in 1658. Sporadic warfare with Kandy continued for over a century. In the aftermath of the destruction of the 'Tordesillas system', Portugal had managed to retain Diu but not Hormuz. Goa and Macau had also survived but not Malacca. Nevertheless, the downfall of the Portuguese Indian empire was not territorial but economic: the competition of other European powers whose demographics were more numerous, access to capital easier and access to markets, more direct, than Portugal's. Lisbon's distributive monopoly had been stolen from the Islamic world and accrued of more direct competition, it crumbled quickly. In all, and also because the Dutch were kept busy with their expansion in Indonesia, the conquests made at the expense of the Portuguese were modest: some Indonesian possessions and a few cities and fortresses in Southern India. The most important blow to the Portuguese eastern empire would be the conquest of Malacca in 1641 (depriving them of the control over these straits), Ceylon in 1658, and the Malabar coast in 1663, even after the signing of the peace Treaty of The Hague (1661).

In 1621 the Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie (Authorised West India Company or WIC) was created to take control of the sugar trade and colonise America (the New Netherland project). The Company benefited from a large investment in capital, drawing on the enthusiasm of the best financiers and capitalists of the Republic. The Dutch West India Company would not, however, be as successful as its eastern counterpart. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of the then capital of the State of Brazil, the city of S√£o Salvador da Bahia, but the Dutch conquest was short lived. In 1625, a joint Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese fleet of 52 ships and 12,000 men rapidly recaptured Salvador. In 1630 the Dutch returned, and captured Olinda and then Recife, renamed Mauritsstadt, thus establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander Matias de Albuquerque retreated his forces inland, to establish a camp dubbed Arraial do Bom Jesus.Saturnino Monteiro (2011) Portuguese Sea Battles Volume VI ‚Äì 1627‚Äì1668 p. 57. Until 1635, the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks, and were virtually confined to the walled perimeter of the cities. Eventually, the Dutch evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but on his retreat to Bahia, Matias de Albuquerque captured Calabar at Porto Calvo, and had him hung for treason.Saturnino Monteiro (2011) Portuguese Sea Battles Volume VI ‚Äì 1627‚Äì1668 p. 127. The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638. Nonetheless, by 1641 the Dutch captured S√£o Lu√≠s, leaving them in control of northwestern Brazil between Maranh√£o and Sergipe in the southKlein p. 47. =Pernambucan Insurrection= Dutch siege of Olinda and Recife, the largest and richest sugar-producing area in the world. The capable John Maurice of Nassau was recalled from the governorship of New Holland in 1644, because of excessive expenditure and under suspicion of corruption. Mutual hostility between the Catholic Portuguese and Protestant Dutch, and harsh measures to collect from indebted land-owners who had their estates ravaged in the war ensured that Portuguese settlers came to resent the authority of the new Dutch administration. In 1645, most of Dutch Brazil revolted under the leadership of mulatto land-owner Jo√£o Fernandes Vieira, who proclaimed himself loyal to the Portuguese Crown. WIC forces were defeated at the Battle of Tabocas, virtually confining the Dutch to the fortified urban perimeters of coastal cities, defended by contingents of German and Flemish mercenaries. Still in that year, the Dutch abandoned S√£o Lu√≠s. The Second Battle of Guararapes, in 1649, marked the beginning of the end of Dutch occupation of Portuguese Brazil, until their final expulsion from Recife in 1654. West Africa and Angola At the same time, the Dutch organized incursions against the Portuguese possessions in Africa in order to take control of the slave trade and complete the trade triangle that would ensure the economic prosperity of New Holland. In 1626, a Dutch expedition to take Elmina was almost wiped out in an ambush by the Portuguese, but in 1637, Elmina fell to the Dutch. In 1641 (after a truce between Portugal and the Netherlands had been signed), the Dutch captured the island of S√£o Tom√© and before the end of 1642, the rest of Portuguese Gold Coast followed. 17th- century Luanda In August 1641 the Dutch formed a three-way alliance with the Kingdom of Kongo and Queen Nzinga of Ndongo, and with their assistance captured Luanda and Benguela, though without preventing the Portuguese from retreating inland into strongholds like Massangano, Ambaca and Muxima. With a steady source of slaves now secure, the Dutch abstained from further action, presuming that their allies would suffice against the Portuguese. Nonetheless, lacking artillery and firearms, Queen Nzinga and the Kongo proved unable to decisively defeat the Portuguese and their cannibalistic Imbangala allies. =The recapture of Luanda and S√£o Tom√©= As the Portuguese were unable to send sufficient reinforcements to their colonies due to the ongoing Restoration War in mainland Portugal, in 1648 the Portuguese governor of the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador Correia de S√° organized a military expedition to retake Luanda from the Dutch, directly from Brazil. In early August, the fleet reached Luanda, where de S√° communicated to the Dutch garrison that since the Dutch would not respect the terms of the truce, the Portuguese felt no obligation to do so either. Although the Portuguese were outnumbered, a swift display of force achieved in August 15 the surrender of Luanda and all Dutch forces in Angola. Upon hearing of the fall of Luanda, Queen Nzinga retreated to Matamba, while the Dutch in S√£o Tom√© abandoned the island, which was reoccupied by the Portuguese later that year. Second Treaty of The Hague (1661) and peace (1663) The Dutch, determined to recover or retain their territories, postponed the end of the conflict. But as they had to contend with the English at the same time they eventually decided to offer terms.

Population: History The village of Tosno was first mentioned in Russian chronicles in 1500. It was a part of Vodskaya Pyatina, one of the five pyatinas into which Novgorod Lands were divided. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Tosno was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). Its development in the 18th and 19th centuries was mainly due to its geographic location on the road between the two Russian capitals. From 1774, it was a station at the yam route. In 1849, the railway connecting Tosno with St. Petersburg and Chudovo opened. In the 19th century, Tosno was a part of Tsarskoselsky Uyezd (renamed in 1918 Detskoselsky Uyezd); the governorate was accordingly renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924). On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kolpinsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Kolpino, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Tosno became a part of Kolpinsky District. On August 19, 1930, Kolpinsky District was abolished and Tosno became the administrative center of newly established Tosnensky District. On August 20, 1935, Tosno was granted urban-type settlement status. Between August 28, 1941 and January 26, 1944, during World War II, Tosno was occupied by German troops and largely destroyed, but rebuilt after the war.

Municipally it is incorporated as Sinyavinskoye Urban Settlement, one of the eight urban settlements in the district. Population: History The selo of Sinyavino was created in the beginning of the 18th century, when Peter the Great gave the lands in the area to his military officer Naum Senyavin. The selo was destroyed during World War II and never restored, but the name was transferred in the 1920s to the settlement which was serving peat production. The settlement of Sinyavino was at the time located in Leningradsky Uyezd of Leningrad Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Mginsky District, with the administrative center in Mga, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On April 20, 1930 Sinyavino was granted urban-type settlement status. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On September 20, 1930, the administrative center of the district was transferred to the selo of Putilovo, and the district renamed Putilovsky. On September 20, 1931 the district center was moved back to Mga, and the district was renamed back Mginsky. During World War II, Sinyavino was occupied by German troops. In 1942, Sinyavino became the central point of the Sinyavino Offensive, a military operation of the Soviet army with the purpose of relieving the Siege of Leningrad. On December 9, 1960, Mginsky District was abolished and split between Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts. Sinyavino was transferred to Tosnensky District. On April 1, 1977 Kirovsky District with the administrative center in Kirovsk, essentially in the limits of former Mginsky District, was established by splitting off Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts.

In the beginning of the 19th century, a system of canals bypassing Lake Ladoga were built, which at the time were a part of Mariinsky Water System, connecting the Neva and the Volga Rivers. In particular, the New Ladoga Canal connects the Volkhov and the Neva. It replaced the Old Ladoga Canal, built by Peter the Great, which thus became disused and decayed. The canals collectively are known as the Ladoga Canal. Both canals run along the southern shore of Lake Ladoga, north of Sinyavino.

It is based on evaporation of sea water or brackish water and subsequent condensation of the generated humid air, mostly at ambient pressure. This process mimics the natural water cycle, but over a much shorter time frame. Overview The simplest configuration is implemented in the solar still, evaporating the sea water inside a glass covered box and condensing the water vapor on the lower side of the glass cover. More sophisticated designs separate the solar heat gain section from the evaporation-condensation chamber. An optimized design comprises separated evaporation and condensation sections. A significant part of the heat consumed for evaporation can be regained during condensation. An example for such an optimized thermal desalination cycle is the multiple-effect humidification (MEH) method of desalination. Solar humidification takes place in every greenhouse. Water evaporates from the surfaces of soil, water and plants because of thermal input. In this way the humidification process is naturally integrated within the architecture of the greenhouse. Several companies like Seawater greenhouse utilize this inherent feature of a greenhouse in order to conduct desalination inside the atmosphere of the facility. Design The method can be optimized by using various effects in the categories of thermal energy collection and storage for continued nocturnal operation, choice of site location, various evaporation effects, as well as condensator design and provision of cooling energy to harvest distillate from the moist air. A Desalination Greenhouse using all of the effects in all categories, with an emphasis on the optimized combination of the effects including synergies, is the IBTS Greenhouse. The Global water cycle also includes all sub-effects of HDH, like increased evaporation over the oceans surface and surface increase by wind, making the generation of freshwater on the planet so efficient. Tests There are successful small-scale agricultural experimentation done in arid regions such as Israel, West Africa, and Peru. The major difficulty lies in effectively concentrating the energy of sun on a small area to speed up evaporation.

Population: The name is almost certainly derived from the identically named Mga River on which it lies (which in turn is probably of Finno-Ugric origin); the suggestion that it comes from the initials of the owner of the land in the 19th century, Maria Grigorievna Apraksin (a member of the same family for which the Apraksin Dvor in St. Petersburg is named), is extremely unlikely.–ú–≥–∞ (–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–æ–∫) ‚Äì –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. History The settlement was founded in the beginning of the 20th century to serve the railway station. It was a part of Saint Petersburgsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate. In 1914, Saint Peterburgsky Uyezd was renamed Petrogradsky Uyezd. On February 14, 1923 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January, 1924 the uyezd was renamed Leningradsky. Saint Petersburg Governorate was twice renamed, to Petrograd Governorate and subsequently to Leningrad Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Mginsky District, with the administrative center in Mga, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On September 20, 1930, the administrative center of the district was transferred to the selo of Putilovo, and the district renamed Putilovsky. On September 20, 1931 the district center was moved back to Mga, and the district was renamed back Mginsky. On June 5, 1937 Mga was granted urban-type settlement status. During World War II, Mga was a vital communications node; its capture by the Germans on August 30, 1941, cut the last rail connection between Leningrad and the remainder of the country.Harrison E. Salisbury, The 900 Days (Avon, 1970), p. 304. Later, it was one of the points in which the Soviet Army broke the Siege of Leningrad. The region, mainly comprising forests, was the scene of brutal fighting during the war years and was a resistance point to the German blockade and occupation. As a result, helmets, bullets, parts of weapons and heavy ammunition and other military equipment used both by Axis and Soviet forces during the war are found in sizable amounts in the forests of the region. Recently, inhabitants have often found armed bombs and grenades from the war years. On December 9, 1960 Mginsky District was abolished and split between Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts. Mga was transferred to Tosnensky District. On April 1, 1977 Kirovsky District with the administrative center in Kirovsk, essentially in the limits of former Mginsky District, was established by splitting off Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts. Economy =Industry= Mga is essentially dependent on the enterprises serving the railway. =Transportation= The railway station Mga is an important railway node. There is a train service from St. Petersburg that passes through Mga leaving from the Moskovsky and Ladozhsky train stations in the eastward direction. This train also serves many other settlements in this region, and is used for travel to summer houses (dachas) by many St. Petersburg residents during the warmer seasons. Other railways connect Mga with Volkhov, Kirishi, Ulyanovka, and Kirovsk. All of them are served by suburban trains. The A120 road, which encircles Saint Petersburg, passes Mga and provides access to M18 highway, which connects Saint Petersburg and Murmansk, and to M10 highway, which connects Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Local roads also connect Mga with Tosno, Lyuban, and Pavlovo. Culture and recreation Mga contains two cultural heritage monuments classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. Both monuments commemorate the events of World War II.

The expressway links Port Adelaide and the LeFevre Peninsula to the northern suburbs of Adelaide and major interstate routes via Salisbury Highway (A9) to Port Wakefield Road (A1) and the Max Fatchen Northern Expressway (M2) to Perth, Darwin and Sydney. The expressway is only grade-separated at the North-South Motorway, Hanson Road and Eastern Parade interchanges; the following two intersections are at grade with traffic signals installed. This has led to the route being labelled as the A9, instead of the more common M label associated with freeways and expressways in South Australia. Construction The Port River Expressway was built in three stages: *Stage 1 - Was opened for traffic on 19 July 2005. It consists of a four-lane expressway link between Francis Street and the then South Road, Adelaide, now North-South Motorway; with an overpass at each of the junctions of the North-South Motorway, Hanson Road and Eastern Parade. *Stage 2 - Consists of a four lane high-level, opening road bridge across the Port River between Docks 1 and 2, linking Stage 1 at Francis Street to Victoria Road on Le Fevre Peninsula. This section opened on 3 August 2008 *Stage 3 - Consists of a single track, dual gauge, high-level, opening rail bridge across the Port River, north of the road bridge, with connections to the existing rail system. Opened in June 2008. Stage 1 connected at what had previously been a bend between extensions of South Road and Salisbury Highway both of which had been extended in the early 1990s to meet each other. The original plan had been to install traffic lights at that intersection. Instead, an overpass was constructed with a loop through the Barker Inlet wetlands to provide a non-stop interchange. The bridge (for traffic travelling north on South Road to east on Salisbury Highway and east on Port River Expressway to south on South Road) was named the Craig Gilbert Bridge. Craig Gilbert had been the lead designer of the overpass, but died of cancer before it opened. The bridge was opened and named in his honour on 19 July 2005.Unknown newspaper (possibly The Advertiser) quoted as It was closed and demolished in May 2019 as part of the construction of the Northern Connector on the North‚ÄìSouth Motorway which included new wider bridges on a slightly more westerly alignment. The Port River Expressway is now a major thoroughfare for freight and passenger road traffic travelling from the northern suburbs to the major port facilities of South Australia in Port Adelaide and Outer Harbor. The construction of Stages 2 and 3 was carried out by Abigroup. During 2018 and 2019, construction workers were putting up new elements on the expressway, as part of the Northern Connector project of the North‚ÄìSouth Motorway. Cycling As there is no parallel shared path near most of the Expressway and Salisbury Highway west of Port Wakefield Road, cycling is permitted on the road, except for restrictions due to closed road shoulders during construction of the Northern Connector of the North‚ÄìSouth Motorway from 2017 to 2019. Parts of the detour route were new shared paths constructed or upgraded in anticipation of this detour. The bridge over the Port River includes a shared path on the southern side of the road as part of the construction. At the time of designing Stage 1 of the Expressway, the developers did not imagine that there would be much requirement for people to cycle along it, as Mawson Lakes had not been developed for housing yet, so the Port River Expressway was seen as only connecting industries to other industries. A new path parallel to the Port River Expressway was be built as part of the Northern Connector works. This will complete a shared cycling and walking track between Gawler and Port Adelaide by the end of 2019. As a result, cycling was banned on the Port River Expressway itself. Exits and interchanges The entire road is in the City of Port Adelaide Enfield local government area.

Darjeeling () is a hill station in the Indian state of West Bengal and it is the headquarters of Darjeeling district situated in the Mahabharat Range (or Lesser Himalaya) at an average elevation of 2,134 m above sea level. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Himalayan Bird at Ghum railway station The \\"Toy Train\\" approaching Darjeeling Darjeeling trainstation. A hawker at Darjeeling train station The town of Darjeeling can be reached by the 80-kilometre long Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, nicknamed the \\"Toy Train\\", from Siliguri. It is a 60-centimetre (2-foot) narrow-gauge railway run by the Indian Railways. Established in 1881, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, only the second railway after the Semmering Railway in Austria to have this honour. The toy train leaves from Siliguri, a station located a few kilometres from New Jalpaiguri, and takes about 8 hours to reach Darjeeling through the meandering mountain railway line. The elevation level is from about 100 m in Siliguri to about 2200 m in Darjeeling. It is till to this day powered by a steam engine. A modern diesel engine is used for Darjeeling‚Äôs mail. The railway has long been viewed with affection and enthusiasm by travellers to the region, and the Earl of Ronaldshay gave the following description of a journey in the early 1920s: > \\"Siliguri is palpably a place of meeting.[.....] The discovery that here the > metre gauge system ends and the two foot gauge of the Darjeeling-Himalayan > railway begins, confirms what all these things hint at.[....]One steps into > a railway carriage which might easily be mistaken for a toy, and the > whimsical idea seizes hold of one that one has accidentally stumbled into > Lilliput.

Sikhim, Chumbi and Bhutan (London: Constable & > Company) 1923 pp10-12 The trip up to Darjeeling on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway has changed little since that time, and continues to delight travellers and rail enthusiasts, so much so that it has its own preservation and support group, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Society. The Operation of Darjeeling Himalayan Railways between Siliguri and Kurseong was temporarily suspended following a Landslide at Tindharia between 2010 and 2015. Road transport The Hill Cart Road (National Highway 55) connects Darjeeling with Siliguri. There is another road connecting the two towns via Mirik. There are two different shortcut routes off the Hill Cart Road that go through Pankhabari and Rohini, respectively. Four wheel drives are the most popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the steep slopes in the region. Many vintage Land Rovers ply in the route. Also Maruti Omni and several SUVs are common. The road and toy train communication often get disrupted during the monsoons season due to landslides. Tenzing Norgay Bus Terminus in Siliguri is the most important bus terminus in the region. Airway Darjeeling does not have an airstrip. The nearest airport is Bagdogra airport (IXB), near Siliguri, which is a 3-hour (approx. 90 km) drive from Darjeeling. Air India, GoAir, IndiGo and SpiceJet fly to Bagdogra. Railway New Jalpaiguri, serving the town of Siliguri, is the nearest major railway station. New Jalpaiguri is well connected to major Indian cities, especially Kolkata. Intra-city transport Intra-city transport is mostly by hired taxis. However, walking remains the most widely used method for travelling in this hilly town. Two-wheelers are also popularly used by the residents.

October War  During the War of Attrition, on March 1969, then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed el-Gamasy as commander of the Second Field Army. His appointment was part of a process of rooting out former general commander Abdel Hakim Amer's mostly incompetent loyalists with capable commanders, including Abdul Munim Riad, Saad el-Shazly and Ahmed Ismail. El-Gamasy later wrote that Nasser should have deconstructed Amer's autonomous web of control in the armed forces following the Egyptian military failure during the Suez Crisis in 1956. El-Gamasy was well known for being the Chief of Operations for all Ground Forces participating in the 1973 October War.

He has been described as \\"The Artist of the Arabs\\".\\" Early years Mohammed Abdu was born on June 12, 1949, in Abha, the capital of Asir province. Some sources report that he was born in a small town called Al Darb a governorate in Jizan city. His father, Abdou Othman Al-A'asiri, was a poor fisherman in Tihamah, in the Asir area, who had six children with his wife Salma Nasr-Allah. Saudi Arabia at that time had a Smallpox epidemic, and almost all of their children died, including a three-year-old 'Mohammed'. The couple vowed to name their next child in memory of him. After that time, the family decided to move to Jeddah where their new son, Mohammed Abdu, was born. His father left his job as a fisherman and became a bricklayer. In 1953, Abdou Othman Al-A'asiri left the family after he fell ill; he died before Mohammed could even take his first steps. As an orphan aged only 3, Mohammed went with his mother and his other two siblings to an orphanage house called Ribat Abu-Zinadah; it was a Yemenite hostel for orphaned families. With the financial help of the soon-to-be crown prince Faisal, the children were accepted. Mohammed Abdou commented on the home saying \\"... I learned how to live and depend on myself.\\" After his graduation from sixth-grade, he started taking multiple menial jobs until he joined a vocational institute to make a living for himself and his family. He eventually moved back with his family and bought a new house with the little money he'd been given as a graduation gift by the time he'd finished. In 1989, his mother died, and Mohammed stopped singing altogether. It was \\"one of the saddest moments in his entire life,\\" as he put it in more than one interview. She was the real love of his life and the person Abdou sang for. Mohammed Abdou was so saddened by her death that he decided not to release any more albums from 1989 until 1997. Finally, in 1997, he sang in a National Day celebration to an audience amazed at how mature his voice had become; his voice was marvelous and more tact. That year, he went to London to sing at three concerts with Warda Al-Jazairia and released five albums in the following three months. The next year saw his official comeback when he sang at the Abha Music Festival in 1998, releasing another three albums concurrently. Follow-up concerts in Qatar, Dubai, and Cairo were the much- needed efforts to put him back on the Arab musical map.http://scelnews.com/2012/05/a-biography-of-mohammed-abdo/ Career Abdu early in the start of his career Mohammed Abdu began his music career at the beginning of the 1960s. He entered the world of singing at an early age, during his time at the Institute of Industrial Jeddah, where he graduated in 1963. Abdou's music was based on the older generation's ageless talents and songs of deep heritage. He was credited with preserving many songs called mawrouth (the inherited songs) without changing them significantly. His Chaabyat albums that he released through his label \\"Voice of Al-Jazeerah\\" in the 1990s were his attempt at documenting that old tradition. These jalsat (sittings) were where his talent was best showcased; the oud was the instrument which he connected with most; only some musicians have shown this connection; these include: Farid al-Atrash, Baligh Hamdi, and Talal Maddah. Abdou even sang one of Baligh's compositions, 'Sert Al-Houb' (Love Story), for Umm Kulthum on her 69th birthday. His earliest songs that he used to sing were religious chants and anasheed (Islamic songs that people are allowed to sing) and reciting the Quran after prayer time or in his school's celebrations. Students and teachers alike used to gather around him to hear him sing at breaks. Fearing that he might quit school to follow a career as a singer, his mother asked him to sing only by invitation when the older singers were around so that her son would stay a pupil to these established singers. His voice and oud playing overcame this fear when jaws dropped after he gave a rendition of an old Yemeni adwar (old songs of known Maqama) known for their near impossibility for a young singer to master. These songs were old chants that Yemeni singers sang and competed against each other with, to take each other to tarab. Mohammed Abdu in Egyption Opera House 2019 Personal life From 1983 until 2009, Mohammed was married to Umm Abdul Rahman with whom he has seven children. In 2011, Mohammed married a French woman in Paris, where he was recovering from a stroke.
