Several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. Recovery from copper- cobalt sulfide concentrates The ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble sulfates and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step to maintain the acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution by the addition of lime, and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal. Recovery from nickel-cobalt sulfide concentrates (Sherritt process) The Sherritt process is a hydrometallurgical process named for Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. (now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process developed by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, or they may be treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)6(SO4)2). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO4)•((NH4)2SO4)•6H2O) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding). Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation precipitates cobalt powder with a purity of approximately 99.6%. Recovery from copper-cobalt oxide concentrates The ore is comminuted and the cobalt rich oxides are separated by froth flotation. The cobalt-bearing concentrate is then mixed with lime and coal, and then melted in a reducing atmosphere. Iron and lighter impurities float to the surface as solid dross or are expelled from the melt as gas. The remaining liquid is composed of a heavier copper smelt containing approximately 5% cobalt that is processed for its copper and a lighter slag that is approximately 40% cobalt that is further refined by hydrometallurgical and electrolytic processing. Concentrations of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) may also be reduced by the aluminothermic reaction or with carbon in a blast furnace.Holleman, A. F., Wiberg, E., Wiberg, N. (2007). \\"Cobalt\\" (in German). Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie, 102nd ed.. de Gruyter. pp. 1146–1152. . Recovery from laterite ores Nickel-cobalt lateritic ores can be treated by either hydrometallurgical processes or pyrometallurgical processes, such as matte or ferronickel smelting, which require the entire ore to be melted and the metal values to be separated from the residual components of the ore. The hydrometallurgical process for laterite ore can use sulfuric acid or ammonia leach solutions. Recovery from arsenide ores Arsenic containing concentrates are roasted in a fluidized bed to remove 60% to 70% of the arsenic present as arsenic oxide (As2O5). The roasted ores can be treated with hydrochloric acid and chlorine or with sulfuric acid to give a leach solution that can be purified by hydrometallurgical methods and from which cobalt can be recovered by electro refining or by carbonate precipitation. If hydrochloric acid is used then cobalt may be extracted using alamine 336 in meta-xylene.M. Filiz, N.A. Sayar and A.A. Sayar, Hydrometallurgy, 2006, 81, 167-173. Cobalt can be extracted also using dialkylphosphinic acid. When cobalt carbonate (CoCO3) is heated (calcined) above 400 °C it decomposes into carbon dioxide (CO2) and cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) and can be refined as an oxide concentrate (see above). Electro refining If purifying by electrolysis, an aqueous sulfate solution at 50 to 70°C is usually used with a lead anode (corrosion products from which will not contaminate the cobalt oxy-hydroxide (CoOOH) electrolyte solution) and a stainless steel cathode which will allow for the easy removal of the deposited cobalt.R.R. Moskalyk, A.M. Alfantazi, Review of Present Cobalt Recovery Practice, Minerals & Metallurgical Processing, vol 17, 4, 2000, pp. 205-216. Electro refining in a chloride or sulfate medium at -0.3 V will make a cathode coating of 99.98% Cobalt.

He spent a large amount of his life growing up in George in the Western Cape province of South Africa. In 2005, Steyn recorded his debut album \\"Storie van my Hart\\". Early career Etienne's music career started off when his father gave him an old guitar while he was in grade 8. Etienne never stopped making music after this. He formed his first \\"Hard Metal Rock\\" group Denizen, in 1995 and participated that year in \\"Battle of the Bands\\" in Stellenbosch, and also at Woodstock in Oudtshoorn. Etienne writes his own songs, and has since the beginning. The very successful rock group Goose Gap was founded in 2000. Etienne's peak with this group was their popular song Sugar Me Up Lollipo, which became a hit in South Africa. During this time he also played with groups such as Not My Dog, Wonderboom, Springbok Nude Girls and Prime Circle. In February and March 2004, Etienne was the lead singer for the band Cutting Jade when they went on a nationwide tour, because their previous singer had left the group. In December 2001 Etienne moved to Pretoria, and pursued music as his full-time career, and in January 2002 he worked for a year at David Gresham Records.

He was the Liberal member for Parramatta in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1956 to 1959, and for Eastwood from 1965 to 1988. Clough was born in Warialda, the son of Ralph and Margaret Jane (née O'Farrell) Clough. He was educated at Warialda Convent, and later at St Patrick's Marist Brothers, Sydney. He became an accountant, although he also worked as a station hand and sheep shearer. In 1939 he enlisted in the AIF, serving until 1942 when he was medically discharged. He married railway employee Patricia McNamara on 16 February 1945, with whom he would have eight children. He was commissioned as a Justice of the Peace in 1946, in which year he also became a member of the Liberal Party's State Council. He was the Liberal candidate for the safe Labor seat of Reid in the 1949 and 1951 federal elections. In 1956, Clough was preselected as the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Parramatta, held by Labor MP Kevin Morgan. Clough defeated Morgan, but after a redistribution in 1959 the seat was given a Labor majority and Clough did not contest the election. He was instead elected to Baulkham Hills Council, but re-entered state politics in 1965 following the retirement of Eastwood Liberal MP Eric Hearnshaw, and was Minister for Youth, Ethnic and Community Affairs for four months in 1976. He held the seat until 1988, when he was defeated for preselection by Andrew Tink and retired.

The section on My Darling Clementine features Fonda and Stewart, both of whom played Wyatt Earp in Ford films, interviewing Ford about the director's claim that Earp himself had explained the strategy and chronology of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral to Ford and Harry Carey, complete with a sketched diagram, decades before Ford filmed a version of the melee with Fonda as Earp. Stewart's memorable poker scene as Earp in Cheyenne Autumn, which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and has frequently been cut by exhibitors and television stations, is also discussed and illustrated with a clip. The hour long special was telecast on December 5, 1971 over the CBS television network. The show sometimes appears on Hulu under the title The Great American West of John Ford. The documentary also briefly features a whip-cracking Andy Devine during a comedic sequence with Wayne and Ford filmed in Monument Valley.

The college was founded as the Hamilton Conservatory of Music in 1897 by C. L. M. Harris, who served as the school's first director through 1907. From 1904 until its closing in 1980 due to financial reasons the school was located at premises on James St South. In 1906 the school became affiliated with the University of Toronto through which the school awarded Bachelor of Music degrees through 1918. The school also offered its own associate, licentiate, and fellow diplomas and offered bachelor's degrees through the University of Trinity College, thereby offering three different examination systems during its history. In 1907 J. E. P. Aldous, Bruce Carey, and W. H. Hewlett became co-directors of the college. Hewlett became sole director in 1918, a position he held until 1939. Other directors of the college included Cyril Hampshire (1939–44), Reginald Bedford (1944-8), Reginald Godden (1948–53), Lorne Betts (1953–59), Harold Jerome (1959–67), Gladys Whitehead (1967–74), and Jonathan Watts (1974–80). In its heyday the Conservatory boasted a faculty of 60 and a student enrollment of more than 1,000. In the late 1970s the Hamilton Conservatory of Music experienced severe financial problems. Despite the concerted efforts of the community the HCM closed in 1980. The building was converted to other uses and then abandoned; losing its connection as a cultural center. In 1997 the building was purchased by Vitek Wincza. It was re-opened as the Hamilton Conservatory for the Arts with a vision of a place where music, dance and the visual arts could exist, intermingle and flourish together. In so doing he hoped to put the arts community back in touch with its proud past while creating a cornerstone of an exciting future. Since its re-opening the Hamilton Conservatory for the Art has become a vibrant, all arts educational facility that offers over 100 arts programs for people of all ages. In addition to the school, HCA’s charitable arm, Culture for Kids in the Arts, is dedicated to providing arts education to young people across Hamilton, regardless of their financial circumstances. HCA is also home to a variety of professional arts activities including the HCA Piano Concert Series, HCA Gallery and HCA Dance Theatre and hosts Guitar Hamilton and other guest events year-round.

History  The Bloch company was founded by Jacob Bloch, a cobbler who emigrated from Eastern Europe to Australia in 1931. Bloch's love for dance and music inspired him to travel to local ballet studios and watch the dancers. Bloch began making pointe shoes in a workshop in Paddington, Sydney in 1932, when he noticed a ballet dancer struggling to stay en pointe and offered to make her an improved pair of shoes. Later, he made custom ballet shoes for Tamara Toumanova, David Lichine, Helene Kirsova, and other visiting Russian ballet dancers. With the expanding popularity of his product, Bloch began selling his pointe shoes throughout Australia. The company has since expanded its product line with the addition of dance and street apparel and accessories. Today, Bloch's corporate headquarters are located in Sydney, Australia, with a European head office in London. It operates one flagship store and 14 other stores across Australia, European stores in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Warsaw and one US store in New York; all other sales are conducted through independent retailers. Products Bloch manufactures various types of shoes including pointe shoes, ballet flats, jazz shoes, character and tap shoes, ballroom shoes, dance sneakers, barre shoes and fashion flats, as well as a wide range of dance apparel, gymnastics and activewear. Pointe shoe manufacturing Bloch employs a pointe shoe manufacturing method known as turnshoe. Bloch pointe shoes use three different recipes of paste in the toe box. The standard paste, \\"paste A\\", is a firm, hard paste, that was formulated to withstand varying heat and humidity. \\"Paste B\\" is more malleable and thus allows the shoe to more quickly mold to the shape of the foot; because of its high malleability, this paste breaks down (i.e., shoe structural support degrades) faster than paste A. A third recipe, known as \\"TMT™\\" or \\"Thermo-Morph Technology\\" paste, is a heat activated material that allows the shoe to be molded to the foot when subjected to directed hot air from a hair dryer.

The War Within, Simon and Schuster. pp. 17–26 = Afghanistan = Associate Editor of Washington Post Bob Woodward wrote in his 2010 book titled Obama's Wars (Simon & Schuster, NY): Derek Harvey was \\"one of [the U.S. Lt. General and then Commander of CENTCOM, David] Petraeus' most trusted intelligence advisors in Iraq\\", who in January 2009 was at CENTCOM HQ in Tampa, FL, as part of a team of 80 intelligence specialists \\"drilling down on the Afghanistan component of [President Obama's National Security Council directed Strategic] review\\". Woodward said, \\"Harvey approached intelligence with a step-by-step methodology of a homicide detective...Harvey 'widened the aperture' studying prisoner interrogations, battlefield reports, and reams of enemy documents...by sifting through the enemy's paper trail, he pieced together clues that others might miss.\\" In a personal meeting of Harvey with Gen. Petraeus in January 2009 as part of the NSC strategic review, Woodward reports that Petraeus asked what Harvey had learned about the Afghanistan situation. In reply, Harvey stated: \\"It's the blind leading the blind.\\" According to Woodward, Harvey told Petraeus the US remained dangerously ignorant about the Afghan insurgency. Basic questions had gone unasked over the [7 prior year] course of the war: Who is the enemy? Where are they? How do they see the fight? What are their motivations? Harvey told Petraeus \\"We know too little about the enemy [in Afghanistan-Pakistan region] to craft a winning strategy\\" (see p. 77, State of War) Harvey added the current strategy put America on the path to defeat and—unless the intelligence gaps were filled—a new strategy would be futile. Harvey added that, despite the contrary view of then U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General David McKiernan, \\"reconciliation efforts are likely the only way out of the war.\\" Based on what Harvey reported to General Petraeus, according to Woodward's book, Petraeus \\"decided to create his own intelligence agency inside CentCom\\" (p. 78, \\"Obama's War\\") to offset the shortcomings of the DNI, CIA, NSA, DIA and other US intelligence gathering agencies in gathering information about the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. He asked Harvey to draft plans for an agency modeled on Harvey's approach. Reports Woodward, \\"Soon, Harvey was appointed director of the new Afghanistan- Pakistan Center of Excellence based at CentCom headquarters in Tampa, Florida.\\" States Woodward, \\"Harvey threw his life into the [new] job. He started each morning at 4 a.m., worked 15-hr days and rarely slept through the night. The obsession came at a personal cost. Harvey's wife filed for divorce...\\". Woodward goes on to explain Harvey's approach in the new CentCom intelligence agency in some detail, and that Harvey reached the conclusion that \\"the war could be won, but the U.S. government would have to make monumental long-term commitments for years that might be unpalatable with voters\\" (p. 79, Obama's Wars). = National Security Council = On January 27, 2017, Harvey was tapped by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to join the National Security Council, as the Senior Director for Middle East and North African affairs.

The messages added weight to claims made in 2019 by Parnas's attorney that Harvey met with Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, and their associates at the Trump hotel in Washington, D.C. Further that Harvey cancelled a trip to meet with Ukrainian officials in person to avoid having to disclose the meeting with Congressman Adam Schiff and that he phoned and Skyped instead.

Roma had a crew of 742-764 officers and enlisted men.Gardiner, p. 344Gardiner & Gray, p. 255 As built, the ship was armed with two 40-caliber guns placed in two single gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The ship was also equipped with twelve 45-cal. guns in six twin turrets amidships. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of twenty-four 40-cal. guns and two guns.

Service history Roma was laid down at the La Spezia shipyard on 20 August 1903 and launched on 21 April 1907. After fitting-out work, the ship was completed on 17 December 1908. After her commissioning, Roma was assigned to the active duty squadron, where she remained through 1910, which included her three sisters and the two s. At the time, these six battleships represented Italy's front-line battle fleet.Brassey 1911, p. 56These were all pre-dreadnought battleships, and were thus obsolescent by this period, but Italy's first dreadnought, , did not enter service until 1913. See: Gardiner & Gray, p. 259 The active duty squadron was typically in service for seven months of the year for training; the rest of the year they were placed in reserve.Brassey 1908, p. 52 =Italo- Turkish War= Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya and other Ottoman holdings in the Mediterranean on 29 September 1911.Beehler, p. 6 For the duration of the conflict, Roma served in the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron with her three sister ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Augusto Aubry.Beehler, p. 9 On 30 September, Roma, her sister , and the armored cruiser conducted a sweep in the Aegean, in the hopes of catching the Turkish training squadron, which was at the time returning from the Levant to Constantinople.Beehler, p. 23 Shortly thereafter, Roma, her sister , and the armored cruisers Pisa and conducted a blockade of the port of Tripoli. The ships were relieved on 3 October by the battleships and the three vessels of the .Beehler, p. 19 On 18 October, Roma and the rest of the 1st Division escorted a convoy of eight troopships to Benghazi. The Italian fleet bombarded the city the next morning after the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. During the bombardment, parties from the ships and the infantry from the troopships went ashore.Beehler, p. 27 The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving the city to the Italians.Beehler, pp. 28-29 By December, Roma and the other ships of the 1st Squadron were dispersed in the ports of Cyrenaica. Roma remained stationed at Benghazi along with her sister , along with the armored cruiser and the protected cruiser . While there, the ships assisted in the defense of the recently conquered city from Turkish counter-attacks.Beehler, p. 47 In early 1912, Roma and the bulk of the fleet withdrew to Italy for maintenance necessary after several months of combat operations. Only a small force of cruisers and light craft was left to patrol the North African coast, since the Ottoman fleet remained confined to port.Beehler, p. 64 The 1st Division left Taranto on 13 April for a demonstration off the Anatolian coast, along with the battleships of the 3rd Division, which had left from Tobruk. The two squadrons met on 17 April off the island of Stampalia, after which the combined fleet steamed north. The following day, the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, Salonica, and the Dardanelles. The ships then steamed to the entrance to the Dardanelles in an attempt to lure out the Ottoman fleet. When the Ottoman coastal fortifications began to take the Italian ships under fire, the Italians returned fire and inflicted serious damage on them. On 19 April, Roma and most of the fleet returned to Italy, leaving only Pisa, Amalfi, and a flotilla of torpedo boats to cruise off the Ottoman coast.Beehler, pp. 67-68 On 30 April, the 1st Division again departed from Taranto, bound for the island of Rhodes. Meanwhile, the 3rd Division battleships escorted a convoy of troopships from Tobruk to the island. The Italian heavy ships cruised off the city of Rhodes while the transports landed the expeditionary force to the south on 4 May; the soldiers quickly advanced on the city, supported by artillery fire from the Italian fleet. The Turks surrendered the city the following day.Beehler, pp. 74-75 Between 8 and 20 May, Roma was involved in the seizure of several islands in the Dodecanese between Crete, Rhodes, and Samos.Beehler, p. 76 In June, Roma and the rest of the 1st Division was stationed at Rhodes.Beehler, p. 79 Over the next two months, the ships cruised in the Aegean to prevent the Turks from attempting to launch their own amphibious operations to retake the islands Italy had seized in May.Beehler, p. 87 The 1st Division returned to Italy in late August for repairs and refitting, and were replaced by the battleships of the 2nd Squadron.Beehler, pp. 92-93 The 1st Division left port on 14 October, but was recalled later that day, when the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.Beehler, p. 95 =World War I= Roma during World War I. Italy declared neutrality after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta.Halpern 1995, p. 140 The Austro- Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern 1995, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro- Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement. As a result, Roma and her sisters did not see significant action during the war.Halpern 1995, pp. 141-142 For the duration of the conflict, Roma and her three sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat.Halpern 2004, p. 20 On 14-15 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuing Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Roma and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to permit them to join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.Halpern 1995, p. 156 In November 1918, Roma participated in the occupation of Constantinople following the surrender of the Ottomans. She and the protected cruiser Agordat joined a fleet of British, French, and Greek warships that entered the Dardanelles and landed troops to occupy the city.Willmott, pp. 331-332 The world's major navies, including Italy, signed the Washington Naval Treaty in early 1922 in an effort to stop naval arms races, which were seen as one of the causes of the Great War. According to the terms of the treaty, Italy could keep Roma and her three sisters, along with the newer dreadnought battleships.Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II: Part I Due to the small size and age of the ships the Italians could have kept the ships in service indefinitely. They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old.Gardiner & Gray, p. 254 Roma was retained for only a few years after the signing of the treaty. On 3 September 1926, Roma was stricken from the naval register and subsequently broken up for scrap.

As attacks are chosen from the menu they use up SP and the gauge takes a few seconds to recharge when depleted.

Biography  He was the son of Francesco della Torre (brother of Napoleone della Torre) and Giulia Castiglioni, As part of the factional turmoil between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the conflict of Guido’s Guelph family with the Ghibelline Visconti, led by Ottone Visconti, dominated much of his childhood. In 1277, after the Battle of Desio, in which he lost his father, he was taken prisoner with his uncle Napoleone, and imprisoned in the castle of Baradello at Como. He escaped from this castle in 1284, with the help of Loterio Rusca, the Lord of Como and William VII, Marquess of Montferrat. He fled with his uncle Raimondo della Torre, who was the Patriarch of Aquileia. In 1287 Guido became Podestà of Treviso. After his escape from the castle Baradello, Guido led the Guelphs in the riots that took place in Milan in the last years of the thirteenth century. In 1302, a group of Guelphs, including the Lords of Piacenza and Parma, Alberto Scotti and Ghiberto da Correggio, compelled the Visconti to leave Milan. After twenty- five years of exile, Guido della Torre and his family regained their power in Milan. Henry VII defeat the Torriani revolt, 12 February 1311. Guido then sought to forge new alliances through marriages: Guido married the daughter of Count Filippo Langosco; his eldest son, Francesco, married a niece of Alberto Scotti; finally, his second son, Simone, married a daughter of Pietro Visconti. Being the head of the della Torre family helped Guido in his election to Milan’s Captain of the People in 1307. The following year Milan elected him as a perpetual capitano del popolo. However, in 1311 Guido entered in conflict with his cousin Cassone della Torre, archbishop of Milan: after an unsuccessful revolt against king Henry VII, he was forced to flee, first to Lodi, then to Cremona where Guido died in the summer of 1312.

It was released on November 9, 2010, and the release was accompanied by national television appearances and a national tour. The book surpassed sales of two million copies less than two months after its release, breaking the record previously held by former President Bill Clinton's memoir My Life. Decision Points also opened at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Content Bush's 481-page memoir is broken up into 14 chapters. The first two chapters are about his life before the presidency. The first chapter is about notable events in his earlier life such as his decision to quit drinking in 1986. The second chapter is about his decision to run for Governor of Texas, and then President of the United States. The remaining twelve chapters are about events during his presidency: the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, aid to developing countries, the \\"surge\\" (a decision to deploy more U.S. troops to Iraq in 2007), domestic issues (including Medicare Part D, Social Security reform, No Child Left Behind, and Immigration reform), the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, embryonic stem-cell research, and the financial crisis of 2008. He wrote with the research assistance of former White House Deputy Director of Speechwriting Christopher Michel. In the book, Bush described his moral dilemma over stem-cell research. He extensively consulted members of his administration about the pros and cons of the issue, learning about the benefits of stem-cell research while trying to find ways to avoid encouraging abortions. He likened his concern of the wrong application of the policy to the Aldous Huxley novel Brave New World. Bush writes that his decision to only use existing lines has been vindicated by recent successful research undertaken with non-embryonic stem cells. Bush also talked about the 2000 election in detail and mentioned that he thought he had lost until Karl Rove called to say that Florida was too close to call. The closeness of the election led to the 36-day legal battle over Florida and its 25 electoral votes. Bush was eventually declared the winner when the Supreme Court stopped a court ordered recount in a controversial 5–4 decision on December 18, 2000. Bush notably did not mention losing the popular vote but did make note of the controversy surrounding the election, including the presence of protesters at his 2001 inauguration. Bush also discusses his decision to send troops to Iraq, initially and again in 2007, arguing that Saddam Hussein's refusal to comply with the United Nations needed to end, as well as arguing that failure to send more troops to Iraq in 2007 could have resulted in a situation similar to the Vietnam War. In Afghanistan, he noted the difficulties of capturing former Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. He states that a few months before the end of his term his administration planned a strategy of sending more troops to Afghanistan and increasing drone strikes on Pakistan. He felt it was best to wait until his successor took office for the U.S. military to employ this strategy. Bush explains how he had to have long conversations with some Republican members of Congress, during the financial crisis of 2008, who were reluctant to support the bailout. Bush expressed to them his anger that the government had to take such a drastic measure but reminded them that he is supporting the bailout because he felt a risk of an economic depression was not worth taking. Bush expressed his views of the 2008 election. He stated that he was disappointed that 2008 U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain was reluctant to accept his endorsement and he believed that he could have helped McCain's campaign. He referenced Barack Obama several times, but positively and without criticism. He wrote about his backward-looking last days in office, Advance and publicity campaign Bush has stated that he began writing the book the day after he left office. He was paid $7 million for the first 1.5 million copies. In tandem with book-publication appearances, Bush hosted a November 16 groundbreaking ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The event gathered some 2,500 guests, including hundreds of former administration officials. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said at the event, \\"When times have been tough or the critics have been loud, you've always said you had faith in history's judgment, and history is beginning to come around.\\" In turn, Bush said of the recently hospitalized Cheney, \\"He was a great vice president of the United States, and I'm proud to call him friend.\\" Reactions Reaction to the book began far in advance of its earliest release, even a sneak peek at a draft, as reported by Tim Dowling of The Guardian in April 2010, six months before its publication. Quotations from the draft were published without comment, except for proposed cover pictures for the book. The New York Times Peter Baker, who was given an advance copy of the book, assessed Bush's political standing as the book release rolled out in appearances with Oprah Winfrey, Matt Lauer, and Candy Crowley. At the same time as Baker, on the Times opinion pages columnist Maureen Dowd focused unfavorably on repeated instances in the book of Bush feeling \\"blindsided\\" but concluded that while his \\"decision-making leaves something to be desired, his story-telling is good.\\" To illustrate the last point, Dowd recounted the story in which Vladimir Putin had bragged that his black Labrador, Koni, was \\"[b]igger, stronger, and faster than Barney.\\" Stephen Harper later \\"drolly noted [to Bush], 'You're lucky he only showed you his dog.'\\" Journalist Tim Rutten wrote for the Los Angeles Times recommending the book, which he found \\"unexpectedly engrossing\\" and better \\"than many of his detractors expected.\\" Rutten particularly highlighted Bush's expressed concerns about faulty intelligence on Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction as well as Bush's regrets about the Hurricane Katrina. Seeing a \\"disarming candor\\" combined with an \\"almost alarming off-handedness about the implications of what's being said\\", Rutten compared Bush's attitudes to the characters in Shakespeare's Macbeth. The former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder, stated, \\"The former American president is not telling the truth.\\" He was referring to Bush's allegation that Schröder had promised to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Schröder responded that he had promised only that he would support action against Iraq if Iraq were found to have been involved in the September 11 attacks. \\"This connection, however, as it became clear during 2002, was false and constructed.\\" The Daily Telegraph ran a negative review by journalist Mick Brown. Brown remarked that \\"Bush is no great literary stylist\\" and that the \\"writing seldom rises above the workmanlike\\" while some \\"language is distinctly odd.\\" Brown stated that Bush comes across as \\"likeable\\", but Brown concluded that \\"conspicuously absent from this book is any acknowledgement, or even honest appraisal, of the larger failings of his presidency\\". Journalist Michael Barone wrote for National Review praising Bush for admitting to \\"serious errors up front\\". Barone cited Bush's statement that he should have stayed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and deployed active-duty troops quickly in order to assist Hurricane Katrina victims as well as Bush's admission that he failed to see the \\"house of cards\\" in America's financial sector.

A pharmacy has always been run in its southeastern (frontmost) corner. During the 1870s, the increasing importance of the railroad industry to Lima's northern side resulted in the northward expansion of the city's downtown.

Description As Harpa harpa, up to 7 cm, with 11–14 axial ribs and higher spire. Colour white with cream and pale brown banding. Columella with large, central purple blotch; aperture white. The ovate shell is oblong. It is rather small and slightly elongated. The whorls of the spire are distinct and mucronated (= ending in an abruptly tapering point). The body whorl has eleven or twelve narrow and slightly elevated longitudinal ribs, the surface of which, of a yellow ground, is crossed transversely by a great number of very fine blackish lines, which approach alternately, two by two. The intervals of the ribs are marked with very thin and delicate longitudinal striae, and with brown and whitish lines undulating in bars. Sometimes one or two whitish bands are observed upon the body whorl. The aperture is ovate, alike whitish, with several small brown bands upon the edge of the outer lip which, externally, is covered by the last rib. The columella is almost straight and is marked with small brown spots.Kiener (1840).

This name is an unaccepted name because this name was not properly published. It is listed in WoRMS because it appears on various websitesBouchet, P. (2015). Harpa fulvomichaelensis Orga, 1999. In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=458035 on 2016-02-28 Description The body has a very large foot, which does not fit all in the shell, the back has a half moon shape dilated, the front is elongated, measuring about 70 mm. in length and 47 mm. wide, the color of the foot is pink-cream with dark brown spots and streaks. The head has a small trunk on the end of which there is the mouth, the trunk is 15 mm long. On the head there are two thin tentacles, located on the side of the trunk, about which there are the eyes, the tentacles are about 20 mm. The pallial siphon, located anteriorly, measuring 15 mm. The small radula is rachiglossa, comprising a series of transverse teeth acuminata, three for the first row is a lateral tooth, the second (middle) is a tooth rachidian and the last is a lateral tooth. = The shell = The shell is medium in size, measuring 30–35 mm. in height and 20–23 mm in length. The shell looks not very thick, a conical spire moderately elevated, with the apex (proto), cream colored, and with the last round (or recess) large and bulging, that almost completely surrounds the previous year, the suture is well imprinted. The stoma is very broad, with a slight notch front. The last round has 15 globular coasts axial regularly rounded and of medium height, 2–3 mm thick on average., Coastline ending on the shoulder with small spines. These designs have a coil tawny-orange, pink and tan. The outer lip is smooth and is constituted by the last coast, that is not sharp and is semi-rounded. The inner lip has a slight callus transparent. The columellar lip and the columella are smooth and have brown spots. The intercostal spaces are crossed by thin stripes, on which there is a characteristic pattern of harps in a zigzag pattern, which in this species is fawn, also among the intercostal spaces alternates a brown semi-square, located at mid-height of the intercostal space. The shell is not particularly bright when compared with other species of the Indo-Pacific area; the core background is pink. As in other animals of this genus lacks the periostracum and operculum. The Harpa fulvomichaelensis Orga, 1998 has peculiar characteristics, the coasts is rounded in section and is similar to the one that presents Harpa goodwini Rehder, 1993. Because of the conical spire moderately high, the size and the average number of coasts this species is placed very close to Harpa amouretta Röding, 1798. from which it differs because it does not have the ribbed triangular section. Furthermore, the opening of Harpa fulvomichaelensis is wide and rounded instead that of Harpa amouretta is semi oval and relatively narrow. Another species is very close Harpa kajiyamai Habe, 1970, which has a shell characterized by a very thin thickness when compared to Harpa fulvomichaelensis, also the coloring of the apex or protoconch in Harpa kajiyamai is brown, however in our cream is clear. The coasts of Harpa kajiyamai are little thick, measure an average between 1 and 1.5 mm. Instead of those Harpa fulvomichaelensis have a thickness greater, on average 2–3 mm. Distribution This marine species living off the southern coast of Somalia in Indian Ocean.

Description The size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 110 mm. The ovate shell is a little ventricose. The spire is slightly elongated and submuricated. The 12 to 14 whorls are flattened above, surmounted by ribs which are continued. The whorls become broader as they approach the lip. They are ornamented with transverse black lines, dividing them into unequal spaces, the coloring of which is less deep than that of the interstices of the ribs. The ribs are of a grayish or brown tint, of little variety, with wide spots, which sometimes form bands of a bloody purple. There are undulating lines in zigzags or white festoons, and brown meanderings between them. There are ovate, short sharp spines on shoulder. The upper band of the body whorl often becomes more apparent from the brightened or even whitish shade of its color. The ovate aperture is of an orange white. The outer lip is marked by brown spots internally, and bordered externally by the last rib which is denticulated in a portion of its length. The columella is slightly arched at the base, almost covered in its length by three very distant violet or brown spots.Kiener (1840).

The case is considered significant in constitutional terms for its ruling on the extent of Ministerial prerogative powers.  Facts  The Fire Brigades Union, representing members who had been victims of violent crimes, claimed that the Secretary of State (Michael Howard) had a statutory duty to bring a new Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme into force. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 provided compensation to violent crime victims, calculated on the same basis as actions in tort, but under Section 171, would only come into force \\"on such day as the Secretary of State may… appoint\\". The Secretary of State had not appointed a day, and in 1993 said they would not. A compensation scheme had been running since 1964 under the Crown's prerogative power, but instead of moving to a statutory scheme, the Secretary of State said that a new non-statutory tariff scheme would be introduced with compensation fixed according to tariffs, that were less-beneficial than the common law. In July 1994, the House of Commons, by the Appropriation Act 1994, approved the supply of money for these tariffs for the criminal injury compensation scheme. The FBU argued the Secretary of State had: # Acted unlawfully under the Criminal Justice Act by failing or refusing to bring the scheme into force, and; # Abused his prerogative powers. The Court of Appeal ruled that there was no enforceable duty on the Home Secretary to bring the legislation into force at any particular time. The Home Secretary was held to have the discretion to implement the legislation when he felt it was appropriate and to compel the Home Secretary to Act would be to interfere with the legislative process. However, it would be an abuse of power to not implement the legislation as the Home Secretary was under a duty to keep the question of when the legislation should be implemented under review.  Judgment  The House of Lords held by a majority that Section 107 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 imposed a continuing duty on the Secretary of State to consider whether to bring the statutory scheme into force under Sections 108–117, and that he could not lawfully bind himself to not exercise the discretion that was conferred on him. The tariff scheme was also held to be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. This meant the Secretary of State's decision to not bring Sections 108–117 into force and introduce the tariff scheme had been unlawful. However, Section 171(1) did not impose a legally enforceable duty on the Secretary of State to bring Sections 108–117 into force at any particular time.

Notable musicians who have attended the Bloom School include Alex Wurman, Graham Maby, Steve Rodby, Jon Weber, Cliff Colnot, Rob Parton, Mark Colby, and Rob Mazurek, with workshops from John Scofield and Mike Stern. Bloom authors jazz instruction books under his own Bloom School of Jazz Publishing which is distributed by Hal Leonard. Along with composing, arranging, writing, and directing The Bloom School of Jazz, Bloom directs documentary films about essential human values. Bloom's father was the late educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom, who made major contributions to the classification of educational objectives and to the theory of mastery-learning. David Bloom's own applications of mastery-learning have made him one of the most sought after teachers in Jazz today. Early years David Bloom was born in Chicago. At age nine, he began studying clarinet with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's first clarinetist, Jerome Stowell. A year later Bloom moved to California and began studying folk guitar with a Mrs. Shnyder. He then moved back to Chicago at 11 and played folk music with his brother until fifteen, when he started a rock-blues band. At seventeen, Bloom attended a blues concert at the University of Chicago Blues Festival where he heard Buddy Guy and was so moved by his playing that he called him up the next day and asked if he would teach him. Guy told Bloom that he had never taught anyone before but Bloom convinced him to give him a lesson. When asked how much the lesson would cost, Guy told him \\"five dollars.\\" When asked \\"for how long?\\" Guy responded, \\"as long as it takes.\\" Bloom studied with Guy every Sunday for a year. He then got a job at Harry Fistel's Chicago musicians co-op where he met an exceptional blues guitarist, William McDonald. William took David to Pepper's Lounge and introduced him to everyone in the place, as well as encouraging him to sit in with numerous bands on the south side (Pepper's Lounge and Teresa's), and on the west side (Sportsman's Lounge and Walton's Corner). After studying with Buddy Guy, Bloom began studying with Reginald Boyd, a master musician and the musical contractor at Chess Records. At nineteen Bloom went to Berklee College of Music for two years.

Born in Liverpool, Moore worked as a fork-lift truck driver and part-time musician. He first played drums with the Silver Beetles in May 1960, at the suggestion of Allan Williams, and later that month travelled to Scotland with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe, when they acted as a backing band for singer Johnny Gentle. During the tour, he was injured and lost his front teeth when the band's van, driven by Gentle, had a minor accident. However, Lennon and the Scottish organiser of the tour took him out of hospital and insisted that he perform with the rest of the group. After they returned to Liverpool, Moore had already decided that he had 'had enough of Lennon'; when he did not appear for a gig one night, the rest of the band went round to his flat, and were told by his girlfriend that he had gone back to his steady job at the bottle works. When they tried to persuade her otherwise, she apparently said 'you can all piss off!' He undertook one further performance with the group, before they left for Germany with Pete Best as their drummer in August 1960. Moore continued to work in Liverpool and died of a brain haemorrhage in 1981, seventeen days after his 50th birthday. The death record for Thomas Henry Moore in the September quarter of 1981 in Liverpool states that he was born in 1931 rather than 1924 as sometimes stated; this made him 28 when he played with the Beatles, rather than 36.

This Ru---H agostic interaction is long (2.59 Å) and weak. The low symmetry of the compound is reflected by the differing lengths of the Ru-P bonds: 2.374, 2.412, and 2.230 Å.La Placa, S.

Reactions In the presence of excess of triphenylphosphine, RuCl2(PPh3)3 binds a fourth phosphine to give black RuCl2(PPh3)4. The triphenylphosphine ligands in both the tris(phosphine) and tetrakis(phosphine) complexes are labile and are readily substituted by other ligands. Notably, the tetrakis(phosphine) complex is a precursor to the Grubbs catalysts.Georgios C. Vougioukalakis, Robert H.

On the other hand, it catalyzes the oxidation of alkanes to tertiary alcohols, amides to t-butyldioxyamides, and tertiary amines to α-(t-butyldioxyamides) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Using other peroxides, oxygen, and acetone, the catalyst can oxidize alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.

Asitimbay's mother was an elementary school teacher and her father was a government employee. Asitimbay has been writing poetry and stories since elementary school. She published her first poem when she was in high school for Pencil Marks, the school's literary magazine. Throughout college, she continued to publish articles, essays, and poems for literary magazines and newspapers. After graduating in international relations from Michigan State University, she moved to New York City. Before writing her first book, she worked at many jobs, including a copy editor for a legal book publisher, a Spanish court interpreter, a political reporter in Mexico for a daily newspaper, and a history teacher in a New York City public high school. Asitimbay currently lives in San Diego, where she is an adjunct instructor in the English Language Institute at University of California, San Diego Extension. Books Asitimbay's first book on American behavior called \\"What's Up, America?\\" (2005), was selected as a finalist for the Fresh Voices Award and the author was praised by reviewers and called \\"a powerful and important emerging cultural commentator.\\" Following the book's publication, Asitimbay appeared on Fox Tv on the morning \\"FOX & FRIENDS\\" show“Fox and Friends” Fox TV Cable Network Morning Show, New York, January 7, 2006 and on KPBS public radio on the \\"These Days\\" show.\\"Understanding Americans' Cultural Quirks\\" KPBS Radio, September 2006 A second and expanded edition of \\"What's Up, America?\\" was released in 2009. This was followed by Asitimbay's second book, a humorous poetry collection for children called \\"No Perfect People Please!\\" (2007), which was Silver Recipient for Juvenile Poetry and received an honorable mention by the London Book Festival. Themes Asitimbay writes about American behavior and culture, drawing upon her many years of teaching international students as a basis for identifying characteristics unique to the United States. She analyzes American cultural quirks, from the magnets on our refrigerators to the bumper stickers on our cars and then compares American habits to Korean, Japanese, and European customs and describes how cultural practices differ in many parts of the world. Asitimbay often speaks about the need for Americans to become global citizens and advocates developing genuine relationships with people from other cultures. Her insights have been found useful to a wide array of international organizations and universities including the U.S. Department of State’s Fulbright scholars, the San Diego Consular Corp, the Citizen’s Diplomacy Council, and National Association of Foreign Student Advisors.(NAFSA), California Association of Teachers of the English Language (CATESOL) and the University of California, Irvine.University of California - Irvine, \\"Understanding American Culture: November 2009 Asitimbay also examines a wide variety of personalities and experiences from a child's point of view as depicted in her second book.

It was built from 1621 to 1642.http://www.irismonument.be/pdf_buildings.phpcity=1050&street;=Parvis_de_la_Trinite&number;=A001≶=fr≶=fr It was located on De Brouckère Square in the centre of Brussels until its demolition in 1893–1894. History Closed by French revolutionary troops in 1796, the only remaining part of a convent, the church reopened for Roman Catholic worship in 1805. In the run-up to the Battle of Waterloo (1815), it served as an arsenal for British troops and subsequently as a military hospital.Theologienet Under Dutch rule, the building was designated a Protestant place of worship, alongside the Brussels Protestant Church on Museum Square,l'église Protestante de Bruxelles and the Dutch Church (Nederlandse gemeente) met in the Temple from 1816 until the Belgian revolution in 1830. The first Reformed service was held on 1 September 1816 and Hermannus Pauw (born 1770) and Dirk Rijke (1789–1830) served as ministers from 1816–1830. In March 1817, the future King William III was baptised in the Temple. Anglican Reverend Holworthy, chaplain to the British Ambassador, held English-language services in the Temple until 1829. View of the Temple in a painting by Franz Gailliard of 1890 The last Protestant service was held on 21 August 1830. From 5 September the building was occupied by Belgian patriots. Many of the worshippers fled the city and the Dutch Church was left without a building, meeting in various locations before it eventually built its own premises at Zuidkaai in 1857.http://www.protestantsekerkbrussel.com/Geschiedenis.htm After 1830 the Temple served various purposes: for performances,http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikels/stadsleven/verloren- verleden-de-brusselse-augustijnen/ exhibitions, and even as a post office. It survived the covering of the Senne river, a drastic destruction and renovation of downtown Brussels. At the centre of De Brouckère Square, the church’s facade was intended by architect Léon Suys to be one of the focal points of the new boulevards. The work to cover the river, which nearly surrounded the church, preserved the integrity of the building at great trouble and expense, but the church was finally demolished in 1893, its style no longer popular with the people and its presence unsuitable for the area. The church was replaced by a fountain-obelisk dedicated to the memory of Jules Anspach. The Temple was demolished in 1893–1894. However the facade masonry was retained and was reconstructed as the facade of the Church of the Holy Trinity at Parvis de la Trinité in the suburban Ixelles district of Brussels.

This installment follows William Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire's adventures in Australia. Tongues of Serpents was released in hardcover and e-Book formats in North America and the United Kingdom by Voyager Books on July 13, 2010. Plot details The story begins in New South Wales, where Laurence has been sentenced to \\"transportation\\" for his treasonous actions in Empire of Ivory. With him is Temeraire; Captain Granby and his firebreathing Kazilik Iskierka; Tenzing Tharkay, his half-Nepalese friend; Tom Riley, captain of HMS Allegiance which sailed them hence; and three dragon eggs, sent by Admiral Jane Roland to form the foundation of New South Wales' Aerial Corps. Dropping by Van Diemen's Land to resupply, Allegiance discovered William Bligh, late of , exiled there after being deposed in a military coup, and have since borne him to Sydney. Bligh wishes for Laurence to restore him to the governorship, whereas Colonel John Macarthur, architect of the rebellion, wishes them to stay on the sidelines, awaiting a decision from London. Captain Jeremy Rankin, last seen in His Majesty's Dragon, arrives on a mission to take command of the nascent covert and whichever dragon births first. It turns out to be the child of Arkady and Wringe, two of the Turkish ferals. Temeraire, speaking to the unhatched dragonet through the shell, attempts to convince him to reject Rankin as his handler, citing Rankin's callous mistreatment of his former mount Levitas, but the dragon accepts Rankin on grounds of his great wealth, giving himself the grandiose name of \\"Caesar\\" (after rejecting \\"Conquistador\\"). Laurence and Granby observe privately that the greedy Caesar and supercilious Rankin deserve each other. Macarthur sends Laurence on an expedition to find a pass from Sydney through the Blue Mountains, which the aviators readily undertake to stay out of the political fray; they are granted a crew of convicts to provide manual labor. Tharkay asks to join them, eventually revealing that he has been tasked with tracking down a smuggling ring that operates out of China — and not out of Canton, the sole Chinese port open to foreigners. The two missions unite when one of the remaining dragon eggs, a Yellow Reaper, is stolen in the night by aborigines, prompting a frantic pursuit across the continent. The unforgiving Australian desert, the unpredictable weather, and the local fauna, particularly the mythical bunyips, take a dire toll on the crew. While the thieves are obviously familiar with the terrain, the Britons are not, and it soon becomes clear that the bunyips possess the ability to alter the terrain, providing watering holes as bait, and later diverting water to create quicksand beneath Temeraire in the hopes of entrapping him. The final egg, an experimental cross between a Parnassian and a Cheqeured Nettle, hatches a sickly runt who is unable to fly. Rankin decides to do away with it humanely, but Demane claims it for himself, naming it Kulingile. Kulingile eats enormously, growing at a rapid pace, and eventually develops the buoyant sacs which help dragons to fly. These sacs are enormous enough to allow him to float, and Dorset, the dragon surgeon, announces that only dragonets destined to become the heaviest of heavy-weights ever exhibit negative total body weight in this way. This creates further difficulties for Demane, as officers who dismissed the runt to his care now envy him his heavyweight dragon and attempt to suborn Kulingile from him. (It is also a source of personal frustration to Demane: though it is not revealed until the next novel in the series, Crucible of Gold, he and Ensign Emily Roland have formed a romantic attachment, and by obtaining a dragon of his own to fly alongside Excidium, whom she will someday inherit from her mother, he had hoped to increase his standing in her eyes.) The British finally catch sight of the thieves near Uluru and chase them northwards to the northern coast. There they find the source of Tharkay's smuggling ring: a port, operated jointly by the Larrakia people and the Chinese themselves, using trained sea serpents to ferry cargo from China. The Yellow Reaper is there as well; she has already hatched and bonded with the Larrakia, calling herself Tharunka, and declines to return to the Aerial Corps, though she is of material benefit in helping Temeraire establish diplomatic ties with the Larrakia. (As a Celestial, he has absolutely no trouble commanding the respect of the Chinese.) Laurence is relieved of the burden of reporting this when HMS Nereide arrives with orders to seize the port by force. However, the bombardment is completely thwarted by the Chinese, by the simple expedient of unleashing the sea serpents against the Nereide, and Laurence and the Nereide are politely but firmly asked to leave. Upon return to Sydney, Laurence discovers that Bligh's replacement, Lachlan Macquarie, is intent on fighting the Chinese over the port, which leads to another rebellion. Macarthur is reinstalled as First Minister of Australia, with him proclaiming the colony's loyalty to the King. Iskierka is ordered to Brazil to counter Napoleon's latest plans there, whilst Macarthur attempts to entice Laurence into taking a position with the nascent Australian government. Laurence refuses, merely seeking a quiet retirement with Temeraire in the Australian countryside.

He was Lord Mayor of Brisbane from 1952 to 1955, and was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1947 to 1956, representing the electorate of Nundah. As with his predecessor as Mayor, John Beals Chandler, he was simultaneously Lord Mayor and a state MP. He represented Labor from 1947 to 1953 before resigning from the party; he was defeated for re-election as an independent for Lord Mayor in 1955 and as an MP in 1956. Roberts was born in Melbourne, but was raised on a farm in the Mallee region of Victoria, and did not attend school until age nine due to the isolation. His family moved to Queensland during the Great Depression, and settled in Ashgrove. Roberts worked as a farm labourer from 1930 to 1932, in road-building and quarrying as relief work from 1932 to 1934, as a sewerage miner in 1934, then from 1935 a clerk in the public service, while studying at night at the Queensland Teachers' Training College. He graduated in arts and law from the University of Queensland, and was admitted to the bar in 1943, although he later chose to practice as a solicitor from 1949. He served on the Labor bodies for the local state and federal electorates, had been a trade union member for many years, and was involved in a number of local organisations at Nundah. He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate at the 1944 state election, losing to John Beals Chandler. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1947 state election, defeating incumbent Labor MP John Hayes for party preselection and then defeating future minister Alex Dewar on election day. In 1952, he nominated as the Labor candidate for Lord Mayor against the incumbent, conservative John Beals Chandler, who had defeated Roberts at the 1944 state election. Chandler was a very prominent figure and the race was thought to be hopeless for Labor; however, Roberts won, not only winning the Lord Mayoralty but electing a sizable number of Labor councillors along with him. Roberts inherited substantial debt from his predecessors in both the City Fund and Loan Fund, but was able to turn both around, shifting the City Fund into credit and heavily reducing Loan Fund debt. The council also built the Tennyson Power Station during his mayoralty. Roberts resigned from the Labor Party on 25 August 1953 in protest at a Labor state executive direction to rescind an already-granted salary increase for Brisbane aldermen, alleging that it amounted to interference with the council. He resolved to continue both as Lord Mayor and in state parliament as an independent. A bid for readmission to the Labor Party was rejected on 20 August 1954 after vehement opposition from Treasurer Ted Walsh. In December 1955, he announced that he would recontest the Lord Mayoralty as an independent. Although it had been long-rumored that Labor would not run a candidate, Labor nominated solicitor M. G. Lyons against Roberts, ensuring a three-cornered race, which was won by conservative Citizens Municipal Organisation candidate Reg Groom. He contested the 1956 state election as an independent, unsuccessfully challenging Premier Vince Gair in his seat of South Brisbane. He was readmitted to the Labor Party in 1958. He was the unsuccessful Labor candidate for his old seat at the 1963 election and unsuccessfully contested Labor preselection for the 1966 federal election in the seat of Lilley. Outside of politics, he continued to work as a solicitor until late in life, doing much pro bono work for local community groups.

Built about 1800, it is a well-preserved example of transitional Georgian-Federal architecture, and one of the town's older homes. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1986. Description and history The James Butler House is located in northern West Hartford, on the west side of North Main Street, north of its junction with Hickory Lane. It is set well back from the street, further than the immediately adjacent 20th-century houses. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with two interior chimneys and an exterior finish in aluminum siding. Styling is minimal on the front facade, with shuttered windows and a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window. The interior follows a center hall plan. The fireplace mantel in the main parlor features Georgian style paneling and proportions. A single-story ell extends to the rear; it is possible that it is original to the house's construction. The house was built either by Gideon or James Butler, sometime between 1789 and 1816. The Butlers, father and son, were descended from Joseph Butler, one of the area's first English settlers. This house remained in the hands of Butler descendants until the 1960s.

Biography Kim Yongchun was the son of King Jinji and brother-in-law of Princess Cheonmyeong through his brother, Kim Yongsu. He served as a minister during King Jinpyeong's reign and served as a Sangdaedeung for Queen Seondeok. He went on to marry Princess Cheonmyeong later on, in order to fulfill his brother's dying wish. It is said that Princess Cheonmyeong was in love with him. When the talk of her marriage had come, the Queen asked her if there is anyone on her mind. Princess Cheonmyeong tried to say \\"Kim Yongchun\\" but she stuttered and so, her mother thought that she was talking about Kim Yongsu (Kim Yongchu's older brother). Kim Yonsu was aware of Princess Cheonmyeong's feelings for his brother and asked him to marry her instead. But Kim Yongchun refused out of respect for his brother who might end up a laughing-stock. Queen Maya asked him as well but he still refused with the same reason. And so, Princess Cheonmyeong and Kim Yongsu got married. Years had passed and Kim Yongsu fell ill and, on his deathbed, asked his brother once again to marry Princess Cheonmyeong as his dying wish and to take care of his son as Kim Yongchu's own. Kim Yongchu agreed, married Princess Cheonmyeong, and took Kim Chunchu as his son.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis The 1996 tornado season saw fairly average numbers across the board, though fatalities were lower than average at just 26. There were a few notable outbreaks, but most were outside the main \\"tornado alley\\" of the midwestern United States. The July F5 tornado that struck Oakfield, Wisconsin was the first F5 tornado since 1992. And the first F5 Tornado in the state of Wisconsin since the 1984 Barneveld, Wisconsin Tornado. Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1996 in the United States. January There were 35 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. =January 3= Nine people were injured by an F1 tornado in Miami, Florida. February There were 14 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. March There were 71 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. =March 6= Six people were killed in Alabama by two tornadoes. One F3 tornado killed four in Dallas County, while an F2 tornado killed two in Montgomery County. April There were 177 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. =April 14= An F4 tornado killed seven people in Stone and Izard Counties in Arkansas. The seven fatalities from this tornado were the most by one tornado in 1996. Among the fatalities were Quarterback Kurt Warner's In-Laws. =April 19–21= A series of tornado outbreaks occurred over a three-day period in Mid-April across a large area of Eastern North America. It was the most notable outbreak of the year; the 19th was the most prolific tornado outbreak in Illinois history. Six people were killed in the outbreak, and 11 tornadoes were rated as high as F3. 33 tornadoes hit Illinois breaking the old record of 25 set on August 10, 1974. This outbreak can also be compared to the May 2004 tornado outbreak sequence as it was a very large, deep and vigorous system. The same system produced tornadoes in Ontario on the 20th, and destructive tornadoes also occurred in Arkansas and Texas on the 21st. May There were 235 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. =May 28= A small, but destructive outbreak of tornadoes occurred in Central and Northern Kentucky in Late-May. The tornadoes resulted in over $100 million in damages and one tornado was rated F4. Despite the damage, there were no fatalities. June There were 128 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. =June 24= Nine tornadoes touched down across the US with seven of them striking the Mid- Atlantic in a small outbreak. The strongest event was an F2 tornado that hit Sudley Springs, Centreville, Legato, and Fairfax, Virginia west of Washington D.C., injuring one. July There were 202 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/1996/7/table =July 8= A rare F0 tornado touched down on Hans Lollik Island, Puerto Rico.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/19960708.99.1 Elsewhere, an F2 tornado touched down in Winthrop, Maine (just outside Augusta), striking Northern Litchfield, but causing no deaths or injuries. It was one of only two significant tornadoes to hit the Augusta area.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Maine/Kennebec =July 18= An F5 tornado destroyed parts of Oakfield, Wisconsin. The violent tornado developed outside of town and moved southeastward, taking direct aim at Oakfield. At 7:15 p.m., the tornado struck the town, injuring 12 people but killing none. It would be the only F5 tornado to hit the United States that year. The tornado's maximum width was about wide, making it one of the narrowest F5 tornadoes on record. There were 11 other tornadoes in Wisconsin from this storm complex, with one death at Marytown.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/1996/7/18/table =July 19= A band of slowly moving thunderstorms moved over Central Pennsylvania producing heavy rain and flooding, especially in the Altoona area where 700 homes were damaged. The storms also produced a family of tornadoes that moved through the area. At 9:20 a.m. the first tornado, rated an F2, touched down 6 miles north of New Bethlehem in Clarion County. It tracked southeast into Jefferson County through Langville. The tornado lifted 1.5 miles west of Oliveburg. The tornado uprooted trees and rolled a mobile home, about a mile north of Truttsburg, damaged some homes, farms, and crops, and downed extensive swaths of trees along its path. It was on the ground for about 10 miles and averaged 100 yards in width. At 9:45 am, just 5 minutes after the first tornado dissipated, a second F2 touched down 1.5 miles southeast of Punxsutawney. The tornado touched down in Jefferson County and traveled southeast into northeastern Indiana County northeast of Glen Campbell. In Jefferson county, damage was confined to trees. The tornado then strengthened and began to cause even more severe damage just east of Rossiter Here, the tornado tore the roof off of a barn that a child, who was playing outside, had sought shelter in. Three of the four walls of the barn also collapsed. The child was not injured, but a horse that was inside the barn was sucked out and thrown 75 feet into a field. The tornado then traveled up a hill and significantly damaged one mobile home and destroyed a second after carrying it at least 75 yards across a road and smashing it against a row of trees. Three people inside the mobile home were injured, one critically. By this time, the tornado had reached its peak intensity of high-end F2. A nearby wood frame house was destroyed and dense areas of trees felled or snapped. About a dozen other homes sustained damaged in this area, 5 extensively. 30 pound cinder blocks from a garage were thrown approximately 300 yards up a nearby hill where a stronger suction vortex was noted. The tornado then tracked into Clearfield County, causing tree damage. The tornado then crossed Five Points into Cambria County across Glendale Lake in Prince Gallitzin State Park before ending 2 miles east of Frugality near the Blair County border, about 30 miles from its starting point. The storm damaged several mobile homes and farms in Five Points, picked a boat out the water on Glendale Lake and felled many trees in the park. A herringbone tree pattern was noted along with suction vortex damage to crops. Around 11:00 AM, another F2 tornado touched down 2 miles east of Colver in Cambria County and tracked 6 miles southeast before ending 1 mile west of Loretto. The path width was 100 yard wide. Two homes and a barn were destroyed, several roofs and a second barn were also damaged. A central suction vortex was visible in crop damage. At about the same time the tornado mentioned above formed, an F1 tornado touched down 2 miles northeast of Altoona in Blair County on Brush Mountain. This tornado moved southeast, taking down a swath of trees and caused and causing minor damage to homes along a 1.5 mile path near Sickles Corner. The path width was up to .5 miles wide. Several other tornadoes touched down across Pennsylvania, Maryland, and several other states later in the day. A total of 20 tornadoes touched down, injuring nine.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/1996/7/19/table August There were 72 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August. September There were 101 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September. October There were 68 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October. =October 26= An unusual tornadic event affected Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota. 26 tornadoes touched down, with five of them rated F2. It turned out to be a record breaking late-season tornado outbreak, although there were no fatalities. November There were 55 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November. December There were 15 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December.

The story of Towelie's addiction is presented as a parody of the reality series Intervention. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone originally planned an Intervention parody around Towelie for the tenth season episode \\"A Million Little Fibers\\", but those plans were eventually scrapped. Several of the handicapped children in \\"Crippled Summer\\" are made to resemble characters from the Looney Tunes cartoon series, including Elmer Fudd, Beaky Buzzard, Sylvester the Cat, Pete Puma, and Porky Pig, as well as non-Looney Tunes characters Droopy and Fat Albert. \\"Crippled Summer\\" received positive reviews, though some commentators expressed disappointment that the episode did not respond to the controversies surrounding the show's depictions of Muhammad in the previous episodes, \\"200\\" and \\"201\\". According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Crippled Summer\\" was seen by 3.56 million viewers, making it the most watched cable show of the night, and outperforming even some prime time network shows that evening. Plot The drug addiction of Towelie, a living and talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of drug addiction to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he was kicked out of their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the \\"no interruptions\\" rule, much to Kyle's irritation). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, \\"Washcloth\\", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son. Meanwhile, at the summer camp, young bully Nathan and his lackey Mimsy plot to destroy Jimmy during the athletic competitions so Nathan can be declared the camp's champion. This sub-plot is also narrated in the same style as Intervention. Nathan uses Mimsy as a minion to carry out his plans to harm Jimmy, but is repeatedly foiled by Mimsy, who either misinterprets his instructions or takes them too literally and causes his plans to backfire. Nathan tries to plant a black mamba in Jimmy's canoe during a race, but Mimsy instead leaves it in Nathan's canoe (when told to put it \\"in the canoe\\"). Subsequently, Nathan tries to lead Jimmy's team into dangerous Indian territory during a scavenger hunt, but instead Mimsy switches the maps and switches them again (Nathan demanded him to \\"Switch the maps! Switch the maps!\\"), and leads Nathan's team there. When Nathan tries to use a whistle with a shark mating call against Jimmy, Mimsy, who was supposed to blow the whistle underwater, instead swims in the water briefly then blows the whistle on land and a shark jumps out of the water and anally rapes Nathan with its nine-inch long penis, according to the Colorado National Wildlife Association. During the talent show, Nathan rigs Jimmy's ukulele with C-4, hoping it will explode during a solo, but when Jimmy cannot perform the solo correctly, Mimsy starts to show Jimmy the correct notes. Nathan interrupts and confronts Mimsy about his failure to understand orders. With a lapse of judgment, Nathan plays the correct notes and causes the ukulele to explode, knocking him away before being further injured by his past plans attacking him again. (The ukulele solo is spoofing the Looney Tunes' repeated use of Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms, where the last note is booby-trapped, but the protagonist always somehow manages to play it wrongly, causing the irritated antagonist to play the correct note and get blown up.) Nathan is subsequently escorted to an ambulance, but is given the champion's crown by Jimmy. Nathan tells Jimmy he hates him anyway before he is sent away to the hospital. The episode ends with a message encouraging people who know towels in need of drug rehabilitation to visit \\"Restore Stephen Baldwin\\", a real-life website seeking assistance for actor Stephen Baldwin. Production \\"Crippled Summer\\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 28, 2010 and served as the mid-season finale of the fourteenth season before a months-long hiatus for the series. Parker and fellow series co-creator Matt Stone originally planned for the tenth season episode \\"A Million Little Fibers\\" to be about Towelie's struggle to overcome addiction in the style of the television series Intervention, with the children and residents of South Park coming together to help him, just as it was done in \\"Crippled Summer\\". However, after writing portions of the story for the tenth-season episode, they found they did not know where to bring the story or how to resolve it. As a result, they completely revamped the episode and focused it on talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the controversy surrounding the James Frey book A Million Little Pieces, rather than Towelie's addiction. \\"Crippled Summer\\" also marked the first appearance by Towelie since the \\"A Million Little Fibers\\", and the first appearance of Nathan, Jimmy's handicapped nemesis, since the eighth season episode \\"Up the Down Steroid\\". Cultural references \\"Crippled Summer\\" served as a parody of Intervention, the A&E; Network, and Comedy Central documentary series about people struggling with various addictions. Throughout the episode, information about Towelie's drug addiction is presented on completely black screens with white letters. This device is used frequently in Intervention. The interviews with Towelie's friends and footage of their pleas to get help are also characteristic of the reality series. During one of Towelie's interviews, he quotes \\"feels like I'm walking on sunshine\\" after huffing air duster cans. Both the quote and his actions are from Season 5, episode 9 of the TV reality series Intervention where they interview \\"Allison\\".List of Intervention episodes Many of the campers at Lake Tardicaca are parodies of characters from the cartoon series Looney Tunes. Nathan and Mimsy, in particular, are strongly influenced by Rocky and Mugsy, with Nathan taking on the role of the diminutive mastermind (like Rocky) who is constantly thwarted by his large but dim-witted accomplice (like Mugsy). Other characters from the summer camp in the episode resemble cartoon characters such as Elmer Fudd, Pete Puma, Droopy, Porky Pig, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, and Beaky Buzzard. The episode ends with a reference to \\"Restore Stephen Baldwin\\", a real-life website seeking to restore actor Stephen Baldwin's career and solicit donations to repay his $2.3 million debt. The joke compares Towelie's addiction and rehabilitation to that of Baldwin, who had a history of drug abuse before becoming a born-again Christian. A version of \\"Are You Ready for the Summer?\\", a camp theme song sung by children in the comedy film Meatballs, is featured. The episode makes reference to actress Kirstie Alley when a counselor says Towelie is the most troubled towel he had seen since Alley's towel, who he said \\"has seen some nasty stuff\\". Reception In its original American broadcast on April 29, 2010, \\"Crippled Summer\\" was watched by 3.56 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It received a 2.2 rating/4 share among overall viewers and a 2.0 rating/6 share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. This rating marked an improvement over the previous South Park episode, \\"201\\", and outperformed those of several primetime network shows that evening, including Fox's Lie to Me, ABC's The Middle, NBC's Minute to Win It, CBS's The New Adventures of Old Christine and The CW Network's America's Next Top Model, most of which were in repeats that evening. \\"Crippled Summer\\" received a 4.1 rating/13 share among male viewers between ages 18 and 34. The episode also ranked fourth for the week among cable viewers between ages 18 and 49 and, because it ranked only behind three NBA playoff games, it was the highest-rated scripted cable show of the week. \\"Crippled Summer\\" was the highest-rated cable show among the 18–34 viewer demographic. \\"Crippled Summer\\" received mixed reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN called \\"Crippled Summer\\" a brilliant episode, particularly praising the return of Towelie, who he said \\"has a slew of great moments in this story, making up for his long absence from the series\\". Isler said after the controversy raised from the depictions of Muhammad in the previous two episodes, \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", he appreciated that the show returned to a simpler plot and provided \\"a little comedy relief\\". The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell also praised South Park for \\"not getting too caught up in the Muhammad thing\\", and praised the jokes about Intervention, which he said \\"is one of those shows that's really easy to parody\\". He also praised several individual jokes, like Cartman's theories about the Jews and Nathan getting raped by a shark, although he said the Mimsy jokes were \\"a little one-note\\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said of the episode: \\"Not the kind of South Park episode that’s going to stir national-news debate, but funny and vulgar enough to satisfy fans.\\" Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine pointed out that although the episode mocked drug addicts and handicapped children, it did not face the kind of censorship \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" did, which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics. Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters \\"should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people have been going on for years\\". Others criticized the episode. MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode \\"just wasn't very funny\\", and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in \\"200\\" and \\"201\\". Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children \\"pointlessly mean\\", and said the fact that they are allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored \\"makes a point about the absurdity of what is and isn't TV-acceptable\\". The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son \\"Washcloth\\", but said the jokes about the handicapped children were unfunny and irritating. The site called it \\"by far the weakest of the season\\" and a disappointment following \\"200\\" and \\"201\\". Home release \\"Crippled Summer\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

Dating to the mid-18th century, it is a well- preserved example of vernacular Georgian architecture, with a modest entrance surround. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1986. Description and history 847 North Main Street is located in northern West Hartford, on the west side of North Main Street opposite its junction with Mohawk Drive. It is set on a low rise above the busy street by a brownstone retaining wall. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with two interior chimneys, a side gable roof, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, but asymmetrical, with the main entrance slightly off-center. The main entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a multi-layered entablature, and there is no window in the bay above. A -story gable-roof ell extends to the rear of the main block. Documentary research suggests that the house was built about 1877, but it has been placarded with the date 1748, the inscription crediting its early ownership to Gurdon Flagg. The doorway treatment is a clearly Georgian feature, and the missing second-floor window is also typical of that period. The decorative treatment of its eaves is suggestive of mid-19th century alterations. The house is signed as having been built in 1748, but architectural research suggests it was built c. 1777.

It is the soundtrack to his award-winning live comedy show. The album marks his first release on an established record label, Shock Records, and the first recording with his backing band, The Awkwardstra.  Themes  The album is notable for its theme; narrating the lives of passengers on board a Melbourne tram, navigating the Route 86, from Bundoora to Docklands via Northcote, Collingwood and through the Melbourne CBD. Heazlewood describes the album as an exercise in character exploration: In comedy, bogans get made fun of all the time, and old people and junkies are all easy targets. I was interested in taking on demographics that are rarely satirised in any way. Noting a lack of art, new media or otherwise, exploring modern Australian identity or actively countering international cultural influence, Heazlewood notes the importance of Songs from the 86 Tram as attempting to fill an underrepresented \\"non-bogan Australian pride\\": \\"From growing up with Sesame Street right through to any comedy on TV being British or American, I feel like we’re really up against it to forge any kind of uniquely Australian culture.

Located along South Main Street in the city's downtown, it was built in a transitional style of architecture in 1899. A two-story structure, it was constructed of brick arranged in an artistic style. Among its leading architectural features was a pair of large semicircular windows in the center of the building's facade; each window was decorated with a sash of aluminum, and the building was crowned with detailed stone carvings done in the style of the works of Louis Sullivan. In 1982, the building's stonework was rated as being equal to that of the adjacent Dorsey Building and superior to that of all other buildings in the city.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 13. At the time when the Linneman Building was built, Lima was experiencing an economic boom as a result of the discovery of petroleum in the surrounding countryside. According to the 1900 census, the city's population was three times that reported by the 1880 census; consequently, a large number of ornate buildings were erected in the city's downtown. Leading among these structures is the Metropolitan Block on the downtown's northern side, but many buildings at the city's center and on the southern edge of downtown, including the Linneman Building, were also architecturally significant.Hopkins, Phyllis G. '. National Park Service, 1980-05-15, 5. Accessed 2010-04-24. In 1982, the Linneman Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its architectural significance. Another sixteen buildings in and around downtown Lima were added to the Register at the same time as part of the \\"Lima Multiple Resource Area,\\" including the adjacent Dorsey Building. Today, the Linneman Building remains listed on the National Register, but it has been demolished. A parking lot now occupies the site of the ornate nineteenth-century structure.Photograph in infobox References Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1899 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Lima, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Allen County, Ohio Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:1899 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Linneman Building"},{"id":"27113021","text":"Moncena Dunn may refer to: * Moncena Dunn (inventor), 1867–1944, inventor of the fraud-proof ballot * Moncena Dunn (soldier), 1823–1895 ","title":"Moncena Dunn"},{"id":"27113024","text":"The Whiting Homestead is a historic house at 291 North Main Street in West Hartford, Connecticut. Built about 1790, it is a fine example of late colonial architecture, with many original interior features. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 1987. Description and history The Whiting Homestead is located north of the center of West Hartford, on the west side of North Main Street at its junction with Lawler Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney, and a center entrance. The main entrance is framed by a molded architrave with ears, and the cornice at the roofline is dentillated. A 20th-century addition projects from the main block's northwest corner. The interior follows a typical center chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule that also has a tight winding staircase. The left parlor has original paneling on the walls and doors, while the right parlor features a fine Federal style fireplace surround. Original doors are mounted on strap hinges. Land on which the house built was first partitioned in 1679, and was assigned to Joseph Haynes, son of John Haynes, an early Connecticut governor. The house was probably built c. 1790 by Gurdon Saltonstall Whiting, a Haynes descendant, and is one West Hartford's few surviving 18th-century houses. It is particularly notable for its largely intact and extensive interior wood paneling. The house remained in the hands of Whiting's descendants until 1920, when it was sold to the Lawler family.

The city of Mexia and three local landowners donated the land creating the park in 1935. From 1935 to 1942, Civilian Conservation Corps Company 3807(C) built roads, recreational facilities, the concession building and a dam of limestone, concrete, and soil across the Navasota River, creating Lake Fort Parker. The park was dedicated by former Texas Governor Pat Neff and opened to the public in May 1941. Old Fort Parker, their spring is located on the left Fort Parker State Park has three hike-and- bike trails: Springfield trail (1.5-mile loop), Navasota River Trail (0.5 mile one way), and Baines Creek Trail (2.5 miles one way). The Bur Oak Trail (0.5-mile loop) is a nature trail with an interpretive guide pamphlet available. Trees in the park include bur oak, water oak, blackjack oak, pecan, and eastern red cedar (juniper). Other plants that can be found are American beautyberry and sumac. Inside the park is the Old Springfield Cemetery, all that remains of the once-thriving community of Springfield, Texas. Springfield was once the county seat of Limestone County and thrived during the 1840s and 1850s, but as men left for the Civil War, the town's businesses began to close. After the war, racial conflict and lawlessness occurred. The railroad passed Springfield by for the towns of Mexia and Groesbeck, and the town of Springfield disappeared. The Fort Parker Nature Center is open every weekend. Canoe, kayaks, and paddleboats are available for rental. Day use, overnight camping, group barracks, an activity center, and a picnic pavilion are all available for rent. Old Fort Parker The CCC Company also rebuilt nearby Old Fort Parker, the site of the Fort Parker massacre, for the Texas Centennial observance in 1936.

The team's history includes two World Series championships and five National League pennants. Franchise history =Founding of the Mets= In 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated from New York to California, leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchises. Two years later, on July 27, 1959, attorney William Shea announced the formation of a third major baseball league, the Continental League. He tried to get several existing clubs to move, including the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, but no National League club was interested. One of the Continental League's five charter members was a team in New York City. Majority interest was held by Joan Whitney Payson and Charles Shipman Payson, former minority owners of the Giants. The second largest stake was held by George Herbert Walker, Jr. (uncle of the future President George H. W. Bush), who served as vice president and treasurer until 1977. Former Giants director M. Donald Grant became chairman of the board. Grant and Joan Payson had been the only members of the Giants' board to oppose the team's move west. The two existing leagues, which had considerably more autonomy at the time, responded with plans to add four new teams, two in each league. One of the new National League teams was to be in New York. The NL offered this new franchise to the CL's New York group, provided that they commit to building a new park. Shea told New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. that he had to personally cable all of the National League team owners and guarantee that the city would build a new facility. The new team required a new name, and many were suggested. Among the finalists were \\"Bees\\", \\"Burros\\", \\"Continentals\\", \\"Skyscrapers\\", \\"Skyliners\\", and \\"Jets\\" (which would eventually be used by the city's American Football League team), as well as the eventual runners-up, \\"Empires\\" and \\"Islanders\\" (the latter nickname would be used by a future NHL team in the area). Although Payson had admitted a preference for \\"Meadowlarks\\", the owners ultimately selected \\"Mets\\", because it was closely related to the club's already-existing corporate name, \\"New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.\\", it hearkened back to \\"Metropolitans\\", a name used by an earlier New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887, and because its brevity would naturally fit in newspaper headlines. The name was received with broad approval among fans and the press. From the beginning, the Mets sought to appeal to the large contingent of former Giants and Dodgers fans. The Mets' team colors reflect this: orange (and, more recently, black) from the Giants, blue from the Dodgers. Coincidentally, orange and blue are also New York City's official colors. Thus two rival fan-bases with 19th-century origins were largely united in support of the new club. For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games at the historic Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan, which it shared with the New York Jets (whose team name was one of the aforementioned finalists for the Mets), which had been abandoned by the erstwhile Giants baseball team. In 1964, both teams moved into newly constructed Shea Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, where the Mets stayed through the 2008 season (the Jets would leave after the 1983 NFL season). In 2009, the club moved into Citi Field, located adjacent to the former site of Shea Stadium. During their history, the Mets have won two World Series titles (1969 and 1986), five National League pennants (1969, 1973, 1986, 2000, 2015), and six National League East titles (1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the postseason as the National League Wild Card team in 1999 and 2000. The Mets have appeared in more World Series — five — than any other expansion team in Major League Baseball history. Their two championships equal the tally of the Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins and Kansas City Royals for the most titles among expansion teams. The Mets are the only expansion team to have won two World Series championships at home, as the Blue Jays, Marlins and Royals have each won one on the road. (Blue Jays in , Marlins in , and the Royals in .) The Mets held the New York baseball attendance record for 29 years. They broke the Yankees' 1948 record by drawing nearly 2.7 million in 1970. The Mets broke their own record five times before the Yankees took it back in 1999. No Met pitcher had ever thrown a no-hitter until June 1, 2012 when Johan Santana no-hit the Cardinals. The franchise's hurlers had gone more than 7,800 games without pitching one — longer than any other Major League franchise. On several occasions, potential no-hitters by Met pitchers have been broken up in the late innings. Tom Seaver twice pitched innings without allowing a hit for the Mets — in one of those games, against Chicago in 1969, Seaver only needed two more outs for a perfect game before Jimmy Qualls singled – while in recent years Tom Glavine, Pedro Martínez, John Maine, Mike Pelfrey, R.A. Dickey, Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom, Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard all lost their no-hit bids in the 7th or 8th inning. After the Mets got their first no-hitter, this left the San Diego Padres as the only remaining team in MLB that has never had a pitcher throw such a game. = 1962–1966: The Lovable Losers = In October 1961, the National League held an expansion draft to stock the rosters of the Mets and the Houston Colt .45s with players from other clubs. 22 players were selected by the Mets, including some with notable previous success such as Roger Craig, Al Jackson, Frank Thomas, and Richie Ashburn. But rather than select talented young players with future potential, Mets management preferred to sign faded stars of the Dodgers and Giants to appeal to fans' nostalgia. Legendary Yankees manager Casey Stengel was hired out of retirement to lead the team, but his managerial acumen wasn't enough to overcome the severe deficiency of talent among the players. 1962–63 The Mets took the field for the first time on April 11, 1962 against the St. Louis Cardinals (the first game, scheduled for April 10, was delayed due to rain). One apocryphal legend has it that in the first game, pitcher Roger Craig went into his windup with the Cardinals' Bill White on third—and dropped the ball. Craig was charged with a balk, scoring White from third with the first run ever against the Mets. Despite Gil Hodges hitting the first home run in New York Mets history that day, the Mets went on to lose that game. It would be the first of nine straight losses to start the season en route to a 40–120 record, the worst record since MLB instituted the 162-game schedule for the National League that season. Their .250 winning percentage was the fourth worst in major-league history, and the third-worst of the modern era (since 1901). Throughout major league history only the 1899 Cleveland Spiders (20–134) lost more games in a single season than the 1962 Mets. It wasn't until 2003 that the record would be threatened by the Detroit Tigers, who finished the season at 43–119. The ineptitude of the Mets during their first year is chronicled in colorful fashion in the 1963 book Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?, written by New York columnist Jimmy Breslin. Beloved by New York fans despite—or perhaps because of—their losing ways, the Mets of the early 1960s became famous for their ineptitude. Journeyman players like the ironically nicknamed \\"Marvelous Marv\\" Throneberry became icons of athletic incompetence. Ex-Dodger and Giant pitcher Billy Loes, who was acquired by the Mets after the 1961 expansion draft, was credited with the ungrammatical \\"The Mets is a good thing. They give everybody jobs. Just like the WPA.\\" Even the young Mets proved to have standards, however. In 1962, Cleveland Indians catcher Harry Chiti was purchased by the Mets for a player to be named later in the season. After only 15 games and a .195 batting average, the Mets sent him back to the Indians; he never played in another major league game again. Chiti was the first player ever to be sent back to his original team in a trade in Major League history. The 1963 Mets featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9–14 win-loss record. The '63 squad also had Duke Snider, who hit his 2,000th hit and later his 400th home run and earned a berth to the 1963 All-Star Game. 1964 On May 26, 1964, in Chicago, they played like champions (at least for one game) and pummeled the Chicago Cubs, 19–1. According to legend, later that day a fan called a New York newspaper to get the score. He was told: \\"They scored 19 runs.\\" There was a long silence, then the fan asked: \\"Did they win?\\" Also in 1964, the Mets, who played their first two seasons in the old Polo Grounds, the former home of the Giants, moved to the newly constructed Shea Stadium, a 55,300-seat multipurpose facility built in the Flushing neighborhood of the Borough of Queens, adjacent to the site of the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs. One high point of Shea Stadium's first season came on Father's Day, when Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jim Bunning threw a perfect game against the Mets, the first in the National League since 1880. For perhaps the only time in the stadium's history, the Shea faithful found themselves rooting for the visitors, caught up in the rare achievement, and roaring for Bunning on every pitch in the ninth inning. His strikeout of John Stephenson capped the performance. Another high point was Shea Stadium's hosting of the All-Star Game. Unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight in the final hectic weekend of the 1964 season, the Mets relished the role of spoiler, beating the Cardinals in St. Louis on Friday and Saturday (keeping alive the hopes of the Phillies, Giants, and Reds) before succumbing to the eventual National League and World Series champions on Sunday. 1966 The Mets' image as lovable losers was wearing a little thin as the decade progressed, but things began to change slowly in the late 1960s. In 1966, the Mets chose catcher Steve Chilcott as the first overall selection in the amateur draft. He became the first number one draft pick to retire without reaching the major leagues. The second pick that year was Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson. That year, the Mets went 66–95, the first season they did not finish with 100+ losses. = Hodges, Seaver and Koosman = The Mets acquired top pitching prospect Tom Seaver in a lottery and he became the league's Rookie of the Year in 1967. Even though the Mets remained in last place, Tom Seaver was a sign of good fortune to come. He was originally signed by the Atlanta Braves in February 1966 out of the University of Southern California, but his contract was voided by Commissioner William Eckert on the basis that the USC season had already started when Seaver signed. In order to resolve this issue, the Mets, Indians, and Phillies were all placed in a hat since they were the only teams willing to match the Braves offer, and the Mets were fortunate enough to win the drawing. In addition to Seaver, two other young players were catcher Jerry Grote and shortstop Bud Harrelson. This trio of youth formed a new, determined clubhouse nucleus that had no interest in losing, lovably or otherwise. By the 1968 season, Wes Westrum would be replaced as manager by Gil Hodges. Pitcher Jerry Koosman joined the staff and had a spectacular rookie season in 1967, winning 19 games. Left fielder Cleon Jones developed as a batter and exciting center fielder Tommie Agee came over in a trade. But although much improved, the 1968 team still finished the season in 9th place. = 1969–1972: The Amazin' or Miracle Mets = The Mets began the 1969 season in a mediocre way: an opening day home loss of 11–10 to the expansion Montreal Expos was followed by a record of 21–23 through the end of May. On April 10, 1969 Tommie Agee became the only player ever to hit a home run to the small area of fair territory in the upper level of Shea Stadium. A painted sign on the stands nearby commemorated the spot at Shea. By mid-August, the favored Chicago Cubs seemed safely on their way to winning the first ever National League East Division title (and their first postseason appearance of any kind since 1945). The Mets sat in third place, ten games behind; but Chicago went 8–17 in September, while the Mets, with outstanding pitching from their young staff, piled up victory after victory, winning 38 of their last 49 games. They took first place for good on September 10, and finished in first place with a 100–62 record for the season, their first winning year ever, a full eight games over the Cubs. The Mets finished with a team ERA of 2.99, and a league-leading 28 shutouts thrown. Tom Seaver led the way with a 25–7 record, with lefty Jerry Koosman behind him at a 17–9 record, while Cleon Jones finished with a .340 batting average. Seaver's best game occurred on July 9, at Shea Stadium, where he came within two outs of a perfect game, but gave up a one-out, ninth-inning single to the Cubs' Jimmy Qualls for the only hit in the Mets' 4–0 victory. The \\"Miracle Mets\\" or \\"Amazin Mets\\", as they became known by the press, went on to win a three-game sweep of the strong Atlanta Braves, led by legend Henry \\"Hank\\" Aaron, in the very first National League Championship Series. The Mets were considered underdogs in this series despite the fact that they had a better record than the Braves, the first place team in the National League West. Shea Stadium prior to a Mets versus Philadelphia Phillies game in 1969. The Mets were given very little chance in the 1969 World Series, facing a powerful Baltimore Orioles team that had gone 109–53 in the regular season and included Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, and Jim Palmer as well as future Mets manager Davey Johnson, who would make the final out of the Series. Before the series began, pundits predicted Tom Seaver might win the opening game, but that the Mets would have trouble winning again in the World Series. As it turned out, just the opposite occurred; Seaver was roughed up, allowing four runs in the opener, which he lost — but the Mets' pitching shut down the Orioles after that, holding them to just five runs over the next four games, to win the World Series 4 games to 1. Seaver got his revenge in game four, pitching all 10 innings of a 2–1 victory. For longtime Mets announcer Ralph Kiner and many fans, the turning point in the team's season, came in the third inning of the second game of a July 30 doubleheader against the Houston Astros. When left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after a ball hit to the outfield, Mets manager Gil Hodges removed him from the game — but rather than simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come out, or delegate the job to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout and slowly, deliberately, walked all the way out to left field to Jones, and walked him back to the bench. For the rest of that season, Jones never failed to hustle. The Miracle Mets magic wore off as the 1970s began. They would continue to produce winning seasons, but did not repeat the success of their championship season. In these subsequent years, Mets pitchers generally excelled but received lackluster support from the hitters, with mediocre finishes the result. Efforts to improve the offense backfired with blunders such as trading Amos Otis for troubled infielder Joe Foy after the 1969 season as well as young pitcher Nolan Ryan for infielder Jim Fregosi after the 1971 season. Once out of the glaring New York spotlight, Ryan became one of the best pitchers in history, spending 22 more years in the majors and entering the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 as a Texas Ranger. Fregosi battled injuries and played just 146 games for the Mets over a season and a half. Meanwhile, Otis became a star with the Kansas City Royals while Foy lasted only one season in New York. The team was thrown into confusion and shock prior to the 1972 season, when Manager Gil Hodges, who had led the team to the World Series victory in 1969, suffered a sudden heart attack at the end of spring training and died. Coach Yogi Berra succeeded Hodges. =1973: \\"Ya Gotta Believe!\\"= The home run apple in Shea Stadium Despite high hopes following the 1969 championship season, the Mets could not break through to the postseason in the early '70s, coming up short three times. Then, in 1973, the Mets found themselves deadlocked with their opponents in what was then the tightest divisional race of the century. Despite going .600 for the month of April, the team then floundered as the season progressed. Hampered with many injuries, Berra's Mets found themselves in last place with a 61–71 record at the end of August 1973, but when they got healthy again, they recovered behind relief pitcher Tug McGraw and his \\"Ya gotta believe!\\" rallying cry (a phrase the team has since trademarked), winning 21 of their last 29 games. Berra also coined his most famous Yogiism that year: \\"It ain't over till it's over!\\" Their final record of only 82–79 was good enough to win the division while five better teams missed the postseason. Despite the second-worst winning percentage ever by a division winner (until the 2005 San Diego Padres), the Mets stunned the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds \\"Big Red Machine\\" in the NLCS, beating them in 5 games. Their record remains the lowest of any pennant-winning team but they managed to push the defending World Series Champion Oakland Athletics to a seventh game. Their near-miracle season ended with a loss to Ken Holtzman in the final contest. This was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. Those two teams reigned exclusively as NL East champions during that span (Pirates from 1970–1972 and won the 1971 World Series, 1974, 1975, and winning the 1979 World Series, Phillies from 1976–1978 and winning the 1980 World Series). =1974-1979: The Midnight Massacre and Dark Ages= After the Mets' 1973 pennant-winning season, the team fell out of contention. They fell below .500 for the first time in six years, and though they resumed their winning ways in 1975 and 1976, they never came close to winning the NL East. As the 1975 season ended, owner Joan Payson died, leaving the team to her husband Charles. While Joan Payson had been the driving force behind the Mets, her successors did not share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three daughters, who in turn left control over baseball matters to club chairman Grant. Contract disputes with star pitcher Tom Seaver and slugger Dave Kingman erupted in 1977. These disputes came to a head when both players were traded on June 15, the trading deadline, to the Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres, respectively, in what New York tabloids dubbed \\"The Midnight Massacre.\\" The Mets received six players in the two deals, but none had any lasting impact. Attendance dropped, to the point where Shea Stadium was nicknamed \\"Grant's Tomb.\\" Coincidentally, the Yankees began their resurgence at roughly the same time, further eroding the Mets' fan base. The team finished in last place yet again in 1978. By this time, it was obvious that Grant had mismanaged the team and failed to invest in its future. Charles Payson himself fired Grant at the end of the season. Things only got worse in 1979: The Mets were in last place before the end of April, and attendance dropped below 1 million for the first time in history. They would not become a competitive team again until the mid-1980s, marking the first time that both New York teams were competitive at the same time, both on the field and at the box office. = 1980-1984: Doubleday, Strawberry, and Gooden = Shea Stadium was the Mets' home from 1964 to 2008. In January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the Doubleday publishing company for $21.1 million, a record amount at that time. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder Fred Wilpon took the role of club president. In February, Wilpon hired longtime Baltimore Orioles executive Frank Cashen as general manager who began the process of rebuilding the Mets much in the same way he developed the Orioles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cashen's positive impact on the organization took some time to be felt at the major league level. He began by selecting slugging high school phenomenon Darryl Strawberry as the number one overall pick in the 1980 amateur draft. Two years later, hard-throwing hurler Dwight Gooden was taken as the fifth overall selection in the 1982 draft. The pair rose quickly through the minors, winning consecutive Rookie of the Year awards (Strawberry in 1983, Gooden in 1984). Cashen's mid-season 1983 trade for former MVP Keith Hernandez from the Cardinals helped spark the Mets' return to competitive contention. After finishing their first three campaigns of the 1980s decade in either 5th or 6th (last) place, in 1984, new manager Davey Johnson was promoted from the helm of the AAA Tidewater Tides. He led the Mets to a second-place, 90–72 record, their first winning season since 1976. = 1985-1988: \\"Party Hard; Play Harder\\" Era = 1985 In 1985, the Mets acquired catcher Gary Carter from the Montreal Expos and won 98 games, but lost the division title to the St. Louis Cardinals in the final days of the season in a memorable series. The Mets began the series three games behind St. Louis and won the first two, but faltered in the third game, allowing St. Louis to remain in first place and clinch the division. 1986: World Champions again Before the 1986 season, Doubleday sold his publishing company to the (then) West German multinational corporation Bertelsmann AG, and used the proceeds from the sale to buy the Mets in his own name for $81 million. He then sold a half-stake to Wilpon, making them equal partners in the team. Unlike the league champion Mets of 1969 or 1973, the 1986 Mets hit the ground running, breaking away from the rest of the division early and dominating throughout the entire year. They won 20 of their first 24 games, clinched the East Division title on September 17, and finished the year 108–54, which tied with the 1975 Cincinnati Reds for the third highest win total in National League history, behind the 1906 Chicago Cubs (116) and the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates (110). The relative lack of excitement during the regular season was more than compensated for by the spectacularly suspenseful and dramatic post-season series. In the National League Championship Series, the Mets faced their fellow 1962 expansion team, the Houston Astros. Unlike the Mets, the Astros had yet to win a pennant, but had former Mets pitchers Mike Scott, the league's Cy Young Award winner, and fireballer Nolan Ryan leading their pitching staff. The Mets took a two-games-to-one lead with a come-from-behind walk-off home run by Lenny Dykstra. In Game 6, the Mets turned a 3–0 ninth-inning deficit into a sixteen-inning marathon victory to clinch the National League pennant and earn their third World Series appearance. The Astros would have to wait until 2005 to finally win their first pennant. In the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, the Mets faced elimination leading into Game 6. The Red Sox scored two runs in the 10th inning and twice came within one strike of winning their first World Series since . However, the Mets rallied and would come back in typical Amazin' Mets fashion, as the game became one of the most famous games in baseball history as the Curse of the Bambino appeared to be alive and well. In fact, it was in this series that talk of this curse began. With two outs and down two runs, three consecutive singles brought the Mets within of knotting the score. Hitter Mookie Wilson ran the count to 2–1, then fouled off 3 consecutive pitches. With the count 2–2, pitcher Bob Stanley threw a wild pitch that Wilson had to leap out of the way of. Boston catcher Rich Gedman made a wild stab for the ball but it went to the backstop. Pinch hitter Kevin Mitchell scored from third base, tying the game. Now facing a full count, Wilson fouled off two more pitches. On NBC, Vin Scully then called a play that would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: Scully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with: The Mets went on to win their second World Series title by taking Game 7, also in dramatic fashion, overcoming a 3 run deficit while scoring a total of 8 runs during the final 3 innings. The final score was 8–5 with Mets' pitcher Jesse Orosco ending the game by striking out Marty Barrett. Orosco then threw his glove high in the air and dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran to the mound to embrace him. This scene was captured on film and would become an iconic image, taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky, in Mets baseball history and in all of baseball. The Mets remained the only team to come within one strike of losing a World Series before recovering to become World Champions, until the St. Louis Cardinals did it in 2011. The Mets winning this World Series is the highest-rated single World Series game to date. The Mets were also the first team to win a World Series in a potential clinching game delayed by rain, as Game 7 was postponed by one day. While the 1986 Mets were undeniably strong, they also gained infamy for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their time because of various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine abuse was the subject of persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations of steroid use and gambling problems. Instead of putting together a winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart. Despite Darryl Strawberry's numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in. This World Series championship by the Mets had a strange twist: Lou Gorman, the general manager of the Red Sox, was vice president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship. 1987 After winning the World Series in 1986 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP Ray Knight, who then signed with the Baltimore Orioles. They also traded the flexible Kevin Mitchell to the Padres for long-ball threat Kevin McReynolds. Perhaps the greatest shock since the Midnight Massacre of 1977 was when Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. But after struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, \\"Dr. K\\" rebounded, as did the team. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading Ed Hearn to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone. They would surge to battle St. Louis for the division title. They would suffer two painful losses to the Cardinals. The first came on Seat Cushion Night where Tom Herr hit a walk-off grand slam. A greater loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman Terry Pendleton hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was Darryl Strawberry and Howard Johnson becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season. 1988 After missing the playoffs in 1987, the 1988 Mets again won the division. Thanks to some stellar pitching from Gooden, Ron Darling, and David Cone as well as offense from McReynolds, Strawberry, and Howard Johnson, the Mets won 100 games for the 2nd time in 3 campaigns (to date, 1988 is also the last time they have finished with that many wins). In addition, Strawberry and McReynolds both lost the MVP to Kirk Gibson as they finished 2nd and 3rd in the voting, respectively. Despite this, however, the clubhouse was distracted by the presence of a young Gregg Jefferies who was just called up. The veteran players took a dislike to Jefferies, who had a habit of excessive bragging, prompting his teammates to saw his custom-made bats in half as a form of hazing. The Mets played the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series in a season where they beat them 10 out of 11 times but, led by Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers continued their Cinderella story season by beating the Mets in seven games. =1989–1990: The Championship Team Disassembles= The 1989 Mets began with a slow start, thanks to an infamous Picture Day brawl between Darryl Strawberry and Keith Hernandez, apparently because Hernandez told reporters that Kevin McReynolds should win the 1988 NL MVP over Strawberry (although Los Angeles' Kirk Gibson would beat both Mets for the award). Eventually, the Mets (as well as the Montreal Expos) would battle the Cubs for the division title in 1989, but Chicago would prevail, despite a career year by Howard Johnson and a deadline trade with Minnesota for 1988 AL Cy Young winner Frank Viola. Those high points were tempered by injuries to Gooden, Hernandez and Carter as well as an ill-fated trade that sent Dykstra and Roger McDowell to Philadelphia in exchange for Juan Samuel. After the season, Samuel, who hit .235 that season, would be traded to the Dodgers for Mike Marshall, who would hit .239 in 53 games for the Mets before being traded to Boston. Dykstra, however, would become an All-Star in Philadelphia and help lead his team to a pennant in 1993. That offseason, the Mets had a mix of triumph and tragedy. They would receive All-Star closer and native New Yorker John Franco in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, and Strawberry, in legal trouble as well, would check into an alcohol rehabilitation center and miss the start of the season. They would also lose key veterans Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez as they left for the Giants and Indians in free agency, respectively. The next season, the Mets would surge again to battle the Pittsburgh Pirates, by September 3 had a 77–55 record a half game lead, but Pittsburgh's \\"B-B Guns\\" (which included Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Jay Bell and now former Met Wally Backman) led the Pirates to their first NLCS since 1979. In that campaign, general manager Frank Cashen fired Johnson from his managerial job and replaced him with former shortstop Bud Harrelson. Although he led them to a good finish in 1990 (Strawberry's last with the Mets, as he went on to sign with the Dodgers in the offseason), the Mets fell to 5th place in 1991. Before the 1991 season the Mets signed Vince Coleman to a $2 million contract after failing to sign defending batting champion Willie McGee (who went to San Francisco). This was the first of what would lead to many bad free agent signings and trades that would doom the Mets during the mid-1990s. =1991–1993: The Worst Team Money Could Buy= 1991–92 During the 1991 season, the Mets were actually in contention for much of the season, closing to within 2.5 games of the front- running Pirates at one point. In the latter half, however, the bottom completely fell out and Harrelson was fired with a week left to go in the season, replaced by third base coach Mike Cubbage for the final games. Jefferies was once again a distraction as he released a controversial statement to be read on WFAN radio: \\"When a pitcher is having trouble getting players out, when a hitter is having trouble hitting, or when a player makes an error, I try to support them in whatever way I can. I don't run to the media to belittle them or to draw more attention to their difficult times. I can only hope that one day those teammates who have found it convenient to criticize me will realize that we are all in this together. If only we can concentrate more on the games, rather than complaining and bickering and pointing fingers, we would all be better off.\\"Heartfelt Plea? Vintage Whine? Jefferies Writes Fans This was seen as the end for Jefferies in New York as he would be traded to the Kansas City Royals in the offseason. The season ended on a high note, however, as David Cone pitched a one-hit shutout against the Phillies at Veterans Stadium, in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League regulation game record (first set by former Met Tom Seaver). With all of the personal problems swirling around the Mets after the 1986 championship, the Mets tried to rebuild using experienced superstars. They picked up Eddie Murray for over $3 million, Bobby Bonilla for over $6 million. They also traded McReynolds and Jefferies for one-time World Series hero Bret Saberhagen and his $3 million contract, along with signing veteran free agent pitcher Frank Tanana for $1.5 million. The rebuilding was supported by the slogan, \\"Hardball Is Back\\".THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING – ADDENDA; A New Approach For the Mets, The New York Times, March 26, 1993 The experiment of building a team via free agency quickly flopped as Saberhagen and Coleman were soon injured and spent more time on the disabled list than on the field, and Bonilla exhibited unprofessional behavior towards members of the press, once threatening a reporter by saying, \\"I'll show you The Bronx\\" . At the beginning of the 1991 season, Coleman, Gooden and outfielder Daryl Boston were named in an alleged sexual abuse incident against a woman near the Mets' spring training facility; charges were later dropped. Meanwhile, popular pitcher David Cone was dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1992 season for Ryan Thompson and Jeff Kent. While the move was widely criticized by fans of both teams, the Jays went on to win the 1992 World Series. Their descent was chronicled by the book The Worst Team Money Could Buy: The Collapse Of The New York Mets () by Mets beat writers Bob Klapisch and John Harper. 1993 The lowest point of the experiment was the 1993 season when the Mets lost 103 games. In April of that year, Coleman accidentally hit Gooden's shoulder with a golf club while practicing his swing. In July, Saberhagen threw a firecracker under a table near reporters. Their young pitching prospect Anthony Young started the '93 season at 0–13 and his overall streak of 27 straight losses over two years set a new record. After Young's record-setting loss, Coleman threw a firecracker out of the team bus window and injured three people resulting in felony charges that effectively ended his Mets career; the Mets placed him on paid administrative leave for the remainder of the season, and announced less than a month before the end of the season that he would never play for them again. Only a few days later, Saberhagen was in trouble again, this time for spraying bleach at three reporters. The meltdown season resulted in the worst record for a Mets team since 1965. In addition, two of the three remaining links to the '86 team, Howard Johnson and Sid Fernandez, departed after the season via free agency. =1994 strike-shortened season= A ticket for the Mets' 1994 Opening Day game against the Chicago Cubs. The following season was filled with some bright spots, but there was still trouble for the franchise, and for the team's franchise player. Gooden, who had a 3–4 record with a 6.31 ERA in the final year of his contract with the team, shocked not only New York sports fans, but baseball fans around the country by testing positive for cocaine and was suspended by Major League Baseball for 60 days. Shortly after he began serving his suspension for the positive drug test, it was announced that he had again tested positive for cocaine and was now being suspended by Major League Baseball for one year, thus ending his Mets career and nearly his life. The day after receiving the second suspension, Gooden's then-wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom with a loaded gun to his head. Still, the 1994 season saw some promise for the troubled Mets, as first baseman Rico Brogna and second baseman Jeff Kent became fan favorites with their solid glove work and potential 20–25 home run power, Bonilla started to become the player the Mets expected, and a healthy Saberhagen, along with promising young starter Bobby Jones and John Franco, helped the Mets pitching staff along. In the strike-shortened 1994 season the Mets were in 3rd place behind first-place Montreal and Atlanta when the season ended on August 12. =1995–1997: Working Their Way Back= 1995 season When the strike finally ended in 1995, the Mets finally showed some promise again, finishing in 2nd place (but still 6 games under .500) behind eventual World Series champion Atlanta. The 1995 season marked the emergence of pitchers Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen, and Paul Wilson. The trio were dubbed Generation K, a group of talented young hurlers who were destined to bring the Mets into greatness, much like Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Nolan Ryan did in the 1960s. However, all three players succumbed to injury, preventing them from reaching their full potential. Of the three of them, only Isringhausen would accomplish much of significance in the majors, but as a reliever, eventually reaching 300 career saves. 1996 season The Mets dismal 1996 season was highlighted by the play of switch hitting catcher Todd Hundley breaking the Major League Baseball single season record for home runs hit by catcher with 41. Center fielder Lance Johnson set single-season franchise records in hits (227), triples (21), at bats (682), runs scored (117). Johnson's 21 triples also led the National League, the highest amount by an NL player since 1930. 1997 In the off season, the Mets acquired first baseman John Olerud from the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Robert Person. In 1997, the Mets finally bounced back with an 88–74 record, missing the playoffs by only four games, and the team improved by 17 wins from 1996. On June 16, the Mets beat the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in the first ever regular-season game played between the crosstown rivals 6–0. Mets starter Dave Mlicki pitched a complete game shutout to pick up the win. In 1997, Hundley's great season was derailed by a devastating elbow injury and required Tommy John surgery. Also, during the season, on April 15, the Mets hosted ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's first game with the Brooklyn Dodgers before their game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium. During the ceremonies, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball. The Mets won the game 5–0. =1998–2002: Piazza, the Subway World Series and 9/11= Mike Piazza on May 30, 1999 1998 The Mets season in 1998 began with an unforgettable opening day game at Shea Stadium on March 31 against their division rival Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first time that a regular season baseball game was played in New York in March. Both of them were involved in the longest scoreless opening day game in the National League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926 when the Washington Senators beat the Philadelphia Athletics 1–0 in 15 innings. The Mets won the game 1–0 in 14 innings when backup catcher Alberto Castillo delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases loaded off Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico. During the season, the Mets acquired Mike Piazza in a blockbuster trade that immediately brought star power and credibility to the Mets that had been lacking in recent years. After the Piazza trade, the Mets played well, but missed the 1998 postseason by only one game. With five games left in the season, the Mets could not win a single game against both the Montreal Expos at home and the Atlanta Braves on the road. Following the 1998 season the Mets re-signed Mike Piazza to a seven- year, $91 million contract, the Mets traded Todd Hundley to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\\"Roger Cedeno\\" . baseballlibrary.com. Retrieved May 12, 2014. Trades netted the Mets Roger Cedeño, Armando Benítez, and the Mets signed free agents Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson, and Bobby Bonilla. 1999 The Mets started the 1999 season well, going 17–9, but after an eight-game losing streak, including the last two to the New York Yankees, the Mets fired their entire coaching staff except for manager Bobby Valentine. The Mets, in front of a national audience on Sunday Night Baseball, beat the New York Yankees 7–2 in the turning point of the 1999 season. Both Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura had MVP-type seasons and Benny Agbayani emerged as an important role player. It was a breakout year for Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and Roger Cedeño, who broke the single season steals record for the Mets. After the regular season ended, the Mets played a one-game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds, Al Leiter pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a two-hit complete-game shutout to advance the Mets to the playoffs. In the NLDS, the Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 3 games to 1. The series- clinching victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher Todd Pratt. The Mets would lose however in the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves, in six exciting games which included the famous Grand Slam Single by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for the Mets. The Mets were at one point down 3–0 in the series. 2000: The \\"Subway World Series\\" In the 1999 offseason, the Mets traded Roger Cedeño and Octavio Dotel to the Houston Astros for Derek Bell and Mike Hampton. Todd Zeile was signed to play first base, replacing departing free agent John Olerud. The 2000 season began well for the Mets as Derek Bell became the best hitter on the team for the first month. The highlight of the season came on June 30 when the Mets beat the rival Atlanta Braves in a memorable game at Shea Stadium on Fireworks Night. With the Mets losing 8–1 to begin the bottom of the eighth, they rallied back with two outs to tie the game, capping the 10-run inning with Mike Piazza's three run home run to put the Mets up 11–8, giving them the lead and eventually the win. The Mets easily made the playoffs winning the National League wild card. In the playoffs, the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants in the first round and the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2000 National League Championship Series to win their fourth NL pennant. Mike Hampton was named the NLCS MVP for his two scoreless starts in the series as the Mets headed to the 2000 World Series to face their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. The Mets were defeated in the much-hyped \\"Subway Series.\\" This marked the first all-New York World Series since 1956, when the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers. With the Cardinals sweeping the Braves in their NLDS series, it made the Mets' run to the World Series much easier, given that the Braves eliminated the Mets from the playoffs and/or playoff contention in 1998 and 1999. The most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward the pitcher's mound. Pitcher Roger Clemens seized the piece and hurled it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base, benches briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections. In July 2000, Clemens had knocked Piazza unconscious with a fastball to the helmet, Piazza had previously enjoyed great success against Clemens, with 3 crucial home runs in previous encounters. 2001: September 11 attacks In 2001, the Mets finished with a record of 82–80. After the September 11 terrorist attacks Shea Stadium was used as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City since the attacks, in a game vs. the Atlanta Braves on September 21. Before the game the FDNY, EMT, NYPD, and all rescue workers were honored, Diana Ross sang \\"God Bless America\\", the two teams shook hands to show that they were united in the face of tragedy, and Liza Minnelli sang \\"New York, New York\\" during the 7th inning stretch. In the bottom of the 8th inning the Mets were trailing 2–1 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give the Mets a 3–2 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Mets, as well as other teams in the league, wore Red Cross, FDNY, NYPD and PAPD baseball caps. Unlike the other teams, the Mets wore these for the rest of the year, despite threats of fines by Major League Baseball. 2002 season In the following seasons, the Mets struggled mightily as the result of several poor player acquisitions, including Mo Vaughn, Roberto Alomar, and re-acquiring former Mets Roger Cedeño and Jeromy Burnitz. These acquisitions were made by then-general manager Steve Phillips, who was fired during the 2003 season. Phillips was credited with building the 2000 World Series team, but also blamed for the demise of the Mets' farm system and the poor play of the acquired players. His final year as a Met was the 2002 season after playing 8 seasons with the club Edgardo Alfonzo left New York after signing as a free agent that off-season with the San Francisco Giants. The Mets did have a few bright spots in 2002. Al Leiter became the first major league pitcher to defeat all thirty major league teams with a victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, the Mets posted a 75–86 record, last in the NL East. The team's 2002 difficulties reached off the field as co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute over Wilpon's attempt to buy Doubleday's half of the team. Doubleday alleged that Major League Baseball attached an unrealistically low value to the team, thereby lowering the amount of money he would receive from Wilpon in the buyout. Wilpon sued Doubleday in federal court to force the sale. The purchase was finally settled and Wilpon became sole owner of the Mets on August 23, 2002. Wilpon, the founder of Sterling Equities, Inc., manages the Mets through his limited partnership firm, Sterling Mets. =2003–2010: Minaya, Randolph, Reyes/Wright, collapses and Citi Field= In a span of about a calendar year the Mets called up top prospects shortstop José Reyes and third baseman David Wright. Since then Reyes and Wright have become the most accomplished products from the Mets' farm system since Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. 2003 season The Mets' record in 2003 (66–95) was the fourth worst in baseball, and Piazza had missed two-thirds of the season with a torn groin muscle. His steady decline around that time mirrored the Mets' fortunes for the first half of the decade. Also José Reyes made his debut on June 10, 2003 and his first career homerun happened to be a grand slam against the Anaheim Angels that season. 2004 season In 2004, the Mets made more poor player acquisitions including signing Japanese shortstop Kazuo Matsui, who never lived up to his potential in two-and-a-half years with the Mets. General manager Jim Duquette acquired pitcher Kris Benson for third baseman Ty Wigginton at the trade deadline just before one of the worst trades in franchise history, sending highly touted pitching prospect Scott Kazmir to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the disappointing Víctor Zambrano. On July 21, 2004, playing against the Montreal Expos the Mets brought up future team captain David Wright but still finished with a 71–91 record in 2004. After the 2004 season, Mets ownership made significant changes to their management strategy. With their television contract with the Cablevision expiring at the end of 2005, they announced plans to establish their own cable network to broadcast Mets games. This investment in what became known as SportsNet New York was coupled with an aggressive plan to upgrade the performance of the team on the field. Jim Duquette was replaced as general manager by former Expos GM Omar Minaya. Minaya, an ex-Mets assistant GM, had achieved notable success in Montreal by making bold player moves on a limited budget. With the Mets, Minaya was given substantial financial resources to develop a winning team. 2005 season Minaya began by hiring Yankee bench coach Willie Randolph as manager, then signed two of that year's most sought-after free agents — Pedro Martínez and Carlos Beltrán — to large multi-year deals. Despite an 0–5 start to the season, the team finished 83–79, finishing above the .500 mark for the first time since 2001. The 2005 season was also the last by Mike Piazza in a Mets uniform. During the 2005 offseason star first baseman Carlos Delgado and catcher Paul Lo Duca were acquired via trade and the Mets signed free agent closer Billy Wagner. 2006 season In 2006, led by a franchise record six All-Stars (Beltran, Lo Duca, Reyes, Wright, Tom Glavine, and Martínez), the Mets won the division title, their first in 18 years. In a runaway similar to 1986, the Mets led the division from April 6 on, and only spent one day out of first the whole season. The Mets finished the season 12 games ahead of the Phillies, and with the best record in the National League. The turning point for the season was a June 9–1 road trip. The 2006 season was also the first time that the Mets and Yankees each won their respective divisions in the same year and both teams tied for the best record in baseball. The Mets swept the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2006 National League Division Series. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, the Mets lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals, the eventual 2006 World Series champions. Game 7 featured one of the most spectacular plays in postseason history when left fielder Endy Chávez leaped over the 8-foot (2.4 m)-high left field wall in the top of the sixth inning and caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen of a two-run home run. Chávez then threw to the cutoff man second baseman José Valentín, who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base, doubling off center fielder Jim Edmonds for an inning-ending double play. Chávez's effort was in vain, however, as Yadier Molina's two-run home run in the ninth off of Aaron Heilman gave the Cardinals a 3–1 lead and Carlos Beltrán took a curve ball from Cardinals closer Adam Wainwright for a called third strike with the bases loaded on a full count in the bottom of the 9th inning to end the Mets season. 2007 season After their success in 2006, there were high expectations for the Mets in 2007, and they started the season strong. The Mets then had a 7-game lead in the division with 17 games to go. The Mets, however, would lose 12 of their final 17 games enabling the Philadelphia Phillies to win the NL East by one game. The Mets were eliminated on the final day of the season as Tom Glavine allowed 7 runs to the Florida Marlins and only got through of an inning in his final start as a Met. The Mets became the first team in baseball history to blow a lead of seven or more games with only 17 games to play. 2008 season In the 2007 offseason the team acquired two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana from the Minnesota Twins for outfielder Carlos Gómez and minor- league pitchers Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra and Kevin Mulvey. The 2008 season marked the final season at Shea Stadium, the team's home for 45 years. Throughout the first half of the season, the Mets struggled, playing .500. On June 16, Omar Minaya fired Willie Randolph, Rick Peterson, and Tom Nieto. Jerry Manuel was named interim manager. The Mets improved under Manuel, highlighted by a 10-game winning streak in July. In September the Mets had 3.5 game divisional lead over the Philadelphia Phillies with 17 games left to play. However, the Mets lost 10 of their final 17 games. The Phillies went 13–4 during the same stretch and won the division (the Phillies went on to win the World Series). The Mets still remained in the NL Wild Card with the Milwaukee Brewers but on September 28, the final game played at Shea Stadium, the Mets were eliminated from playoff contention by losing to the Florida Marlins on the season's final day for the second straight season. 2009 season: Citi Field opens and the season of injuries Citi Field, home of the Mets beginning in 2009. To improve the bullpen for the 2009 season, which was arguably the reason the Mets missed the playoffs in 2007 and 2008, the Mets signed free agent closer Francisco Rodríguez, who established a single- season major league record for saves (62) as a member of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2008. They also acquired setup man J. J. Putz from the Seattle Mariners in exchange for several players. The 2009 season was the Mets' first season at Citi Field, a retropark following current architectural trends in stadium design. It follows the brick and steel-truss trend begun by the Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 1992. The exterior facade resembles Ebbets Field, former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Mets' first exhibition game at Citi Field was played on April 3, 2009 against the Boston Red Sox. The first regular season home game was on April 13, 2009 against the San Diego Padres, who spoiled the opener with a 6–5 win against the Mets. In that game, Jody Gerut of the Padres became the first player to open a new ballpark with a leadoff home run. On April 17, Gary Sheffield, who just days earlier was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his 500th home run against the Milwaukee Brewers. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform. The 2009 season for the Mets was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, with 20 of them having been on the disabled list at one point or another during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like J. J. Putz, John Maine, Óliver Pérez, José Reyes, Carlos Beltrán, David Wright, Carlos Delgado, Johan Santana, and Gary Sheffield. As a result, the Mets finished in fourth place, with a record of 70–92 and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third straight season. Mets players spent more than 1,480 days in the disabled list in 2009, more than any other team in the majors. However, second-half turnarounds of Jeff Francoeur and Daniel Murphy helped the Mets finish the season with the best batting average in the National League, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 2010 season Coming into 2010, the Mets were looking for a comeback after a sluggish 2009 season full of injuries. In their biggest acquisition of the offseason, the Mets signed outfielder Jason Bay to a four- year, $66 million deal with a vesting option for a fifth year. David Wright came into training camp heavier because of muscle he built up during the winter. The Mets brought in Gary Matthews, Jr. to start in place of Carlos Beltrán because of Beltran's surgery in February 2010. The team won their first game of the season, beating the Florida Marlins by a score of 7–1 on April 5. On April 17, 2010, the Mets beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2–1 in 20 innings. This was the fourth game of at least 20 innings in Mets history, but their first win. On April 28, the Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 7–3 to complete a 9-1 homestand, tying a franchise record reached by the 1969 and 1988 teams. The Mets had two eight-game winning streaks in the first half of the season, but started the second half with a 2-9 West Coast road trip. They would never recover, finishing the season at 79–83, losing the final game of the season 2–1 to the Washington Nationals when Óliver Pérez hit one batter, then walked the next three to force home the winning run in the top of the 14th inning. =2011–2017: The Terry Collins Era = 2011 season: Reyes leaves after Batting Title After the 2010 season, the Mets announced that they declined to exercise an option on manager Jerry Manuel and relieved Omar Minaya of his duties. The Mets hired former Oakland Athletics and San Diego Padres executive Sandy Alderson to be their new general manager and was formally introduced on Friday, October 29, 2010. On November 23, 2010, Alderson hired Terry Collins to replace Manuel as manager. In 2011, the Mets had their third straight losing season at 77–85. During the season, the Mets made history in 2011 when Jason Isringhausen converted his 300th save with the team, the third player in franchise history to reach the milestone while with the organization behind John Franco and Billy Wagner. Also, José Reyes became the first Met in franchise history to win a National League batting title with .337 batting average, winning it on the final day of the season after a bunt single and Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers going 0 for 4. Prior to the July trade deadline reliever Francisco Rodríguez was sent to Milwaukee on July 12 while outfielder Carlos Beltrán was dealt to San Francisco on July 27. In December they lost Jose Reyes in free agency to division rival the newly christened Miami Marlins. 2012 season: Santana and Dickey make history Coming into 2012 the Mets were 1 of 2 franchises (the other being the San Diego Padres) to have never thrown a no-hitter. However, on June 1 Johan Santana changed that after throwing a no-hitter against St. Louis in an 8–0 victory. This game was also notable for Carlos Beltrán's return to Citi Field as a member of the Cardinals. They ended the season with a 4th place 74-88 finish. New York pitcher R.A. Dickey would win the National League Cy Young Award. Despite the award it would be Dickey's final season with the Mets as he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the offseason. 2013 season: All- Star Festivities and resigning Captain America  Through the trade of R.A. Dickey, the Mets received many new prospects including Travis D'Arnaud and Noah Syndergaard. After losing the rights to the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets claimed the Las Vegas 51s as their Triple A affiliate for 2013–15. Citi Field was the host for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game which took place on July 16, 2013. Matt Harvey was the primary pitcher for the team and was the starter for the National League All-Stars. During the season, Harvey received the nickname \\"The Dark Knight of Gotham\\" from Sports Illustrated. The Mets finished the season 74–88, the same record as the previous season. However, for the first time in the history of the franchise, the Mets swept their cross-town rivals the Yankees in the Subway Series..

May 31, 2013. 2014 season: DeGrom's Rookie of the Year  Mets ace Matt Harvey was out for the entirety of the 2014 season. During the offseason, the Mets signed former Yankees Curtis Granderson and Bartolo Colón, the latter of which was used to bolster the pitching rotation. The Mets finished their season 79-83 and along with the Atlanta Braves tied for second place in the National League East Division for the first time since the 2008 season. The most notable player of the season was rookie Jacob deGrom who received the 2014 National League Rookie of the Year Award. 2015 season: N.L. Pennant Champions With a 13–3 start, the Mets had their best start in franchise history (tied with 1986). In April, they won 11 in a row for the first time since 1990, and swept a 10-game homestand.http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/colon- improves-4-0-mets-top-braves-11th-straight-win-article-1.2196502 The Mets played .500 ball until the trade deadline. On July 31 the Mets acquired all star outfielder Yoenis Céspedes who provided them with an undeniable spark. The Mets won the National League East Division title for the first time since 2006 after a 10–2 win against Cincinnati on September 26. They advanced to the NLDS to face the Los Angeles, winning in five games. They were carried by 2nd baseman Daniel Murphy who homered three times in the series. They then swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS led by NLCS MVP Daniel Murphy, who batted .529 in the series and homered in each of the four games bringing a consecutive post game home run streak to six games, an MLB postseason record (Murphy homered a total of seven times in the two series). In the World Series, they were defeated by the Kansas City Royals in five games.  2016 season: The Wild Card Game and Reyes Returns to Flushing   2017 season: Injury Plagued Season = 2018-2019: Mickey Callaway Era =  2018 season: A Hot Start, A Dismal Season  2019 season: More of the Same Pete Alonso would win rookie of the year with a 53 home run performance. = 2020-present: Luis Rojas Takes Over = The Longest Games in Major League History The Mets have participated in the most Major League games that have gone beyond 22 innings — a total of three. *The first of these marathons occurred on May 31, 1964 against The San Francisco Giants that went 23 innings and resulted in an 8-6 Giants victory. *On April 15, 1968, the Mets were defeated by the Houston Astros 1–0 in a memorable, 24 inning pitcher's duel that saw Tom Seaver toss 10 shutout innings and give up just two hits.

The game ended at 3:12 AM after Cardinal outfielder Bake McBride scored the winning run. He would go on to win that year's National League Rookie of the Year Award. All of these games resulted in a Mets home loss and all involved home plate umpire Ed Sudol.

Built in 1882, it is a fine example of Late Victorian civic architecture in brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 4, 1982. After serving as a firehouse for about a century, it has been converted into an art gallery. Description and history The former Hose and Hook and Ladder Truck Building stands in a prominent location in central Thomaston, between the town hall/opera house and Trinity Church, two other architecturally distinguished buildings. It is a -story brick structure with granite trim, and a prominent Venetian-style tower with a pyramidal roof. It is basically symmetrical except for the tower, with vehicle bays flanking a pair of pedestrian entrances, which share a protective portico with Victorian arched friezes and spindled woodwork in the gable above. Brick pilasters articulate the elements of the building's second floor, with matching gabled projections above the vehicle bays. The gable ends are finished in decorative shingles, which surround half-round arches containing paired sash windows. The building was built in 1882 to a design by Waterbury architect Robert Wakeman Hill, whose credits include the adjacent opera house (1883-5). It served the town as a firehouse until 1979. The brick used was produced by the Seth Thomas family brickyard nearby. The companies that first occupied the building were volunteer firefighting forces. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Litchfield County, Connecticut References Category:Queen Anne architecture in Connecticut Category:Fire stations completed in 1882 Category:Thomaston, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Litchfield County, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Litchfield County, Connecticut Category:Fire stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"Hose and Hook and Ladder Truck Building"},{"id":"27113086","text":"The 'Whitestone Cliffs Trail' is a Blue-Blazed hiking trail in the Waterbury area in Thomaston and Plymouth, Litchfield County, Connecticut.

White on November 11, 2009 on CT Museum Quest Blog page on Whitestone Cliffs Trail. The pavilion near the trail head and parking lot was erected for an archery group which conducted target practice in this area of Mattatuck State Forest in the latter half of the twentieth century. There were once archery range markers in the woods close to the pavilion. =Folklore= There is a bit of local lore (with some basis in fact) that a colonial settler living in the area in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century was killed by a Native American. The cavity in the earth left by a long-gone house's stone cellar can be glimpsed from the trail on a ridge seventy to eighty meters from the trail's terminus and parking lot area. There is no evidence that this is where the killing took place though some may think so.Blog comment by John G. White on November 10, 2009 on CT Museum Quest's Whitestone Cliffs Trail web page. Hiking the trail The mainline trail is blazed with blue rectangles. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Metacomet Trail Several sections of the trail are in low-lying areas or next to (or become) seasonal streams. Extensive flooding in ponds, puddles and streams may occur in the late winter or early spring, overflowing into the trail and causing very muddy conditions. In this case fairly high waterproof boots are recommended. Some parts of the trail follow forest roads which often contain a lot of loose stones or ruts from ATVs and four-wheel drive vehicles. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. The trail is in Mattatuck State Forest where hunting and the use of firearms are permitted in season. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended.

Biography  =Education= After initial education from his hometown ‘Tijara’, he moved to Meerut at the age of 14 years. In Meerut, he took expertise, knowledge and proficiency on ‘Unani Tibb’ from two leading practitioners ‘Hakim Mohammad Hasan Haziq’ and ‘Hakim Baldev Sahai’. Hakim Hasan Haziq (died 1928) was the author of many books on Unani medicine including ‘Lataif-e Ghalib’ from Naami Press, Meerut, while Hakim Baldev Sahai was himself a student of Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, prime minister and royal physician to Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar of Delhi. =Practicing Unani medicine= Hakim Syed Karam Husain started practicing Unani at Tijara, Alwar in early 1893. He established his own Unani pharmaceutics, by the name of, Dawakhana Shifaul Amraz in 1894 . He was a personal Unani physician of Maharaja of Alwar Jai Singh Prabhakar (1882–1937) and has been a standing committee member of All India Unani and Ayurvedic Tibbi Conference, of whose Hakim Ajmal Khan was the president. Maharaja Jai Singh Prabhakar once invited some significant Unani physicians working in the state of Alwar to discuss the future course and progress and promotion of Unani medicine. Hakim Syed Karam Hussain was the chief-de-mission of that delegation. In that delegation, the other physicians who were present: Hakim Syed Mohammad (Khairtal), Hakim Mohammad Sulaiman, Hakim Mohammad Umar Fasih, Hakim Imam Ali, Hakim Syed Ahmad Ali Akbarabadi and Hakim Ziauddin (Tijara). =Regional personality= He was popularly known as Rais-e Tijara, a very pious and religious person and a resident of Qazi Mohalla, of the Tijara city before the partition of India in 1947. He bought seven Havelis at Tijara including the 'Haveli Qadeem' (the oldest private mansion at the Qazi Mohalla). In addition, he had two other houses in Delhi. In the course of leisure moment, his favourite places of visit were Mount Abu and Delhi. The following Persian commemorative inscription can still be seen at the main entrance of his ‘Haveli Qadeem’ at Tijara: :[By \\"شاہ اکبر\\" (Shah Akbar), meaning both 'Emperor Akbar' and 'Great Emperor', the poet parallels God and Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, and asserts 'Great Emperor' to both]. The above qata was written at the time when Emperor Akbar visited Tijara while moving to Fatehpur Sikri from Delhi. According to Major P.W. Powlett (late settlement officer of Ulwar), \\"Akbar appears to have given some attention to Mewat in AH. 957 (A.D. 1579), he visited Ulwur (now Alwar) on his way to Fatehpur Sikri\\".Major P.W. Powlett. Gazetteer of Ulwar (Late settlement officer of Ulwar), London: Trubner and Co. Ludgate Hill, 1878, page 134 =Community and social works= Being a well-off person in the region of Mewat, he assisted many community and social works by lending either monetary donation or moral support to many organisations such as 'Anjuman Khadimul Islam' (Alwar), 'Jamiat Markaziya Tabligh-ul-Islam' (Ambala), 'Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam' / 'Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam' (Lahore), 'Jamia Masjid' (Tijara) and 'Madrasa Islamia' (Tijara). Ghulam Bhik Nairang was the founder of 'Jamiat Markaziya Tabligh-ul-Islam' (Ambala). Hakim Syed Karam Husain also assisted Maulana Mohammad Ilyas in many occasions when he visited nearby towns of Mewat. The plaque, with the name of 'Hakim Syed Karam Husain', found in a well of Jamia Masjid located at Bazaar during cleansing drive and is now preserved in the Jamia Masjid complex suggests that the main gate of the mosque (Sadar Darwaza) was once built by him. The mosque is believed to get damage during the Partition of India. It is because of the influence of Hakim Karam Husain, that he brought Maharaja Jai Singh Prabhakar at Tijara to visit 'Madrasa Islamia' (Islamia School). Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan, the then Education Minister at the State of Alwar, also accompanied with him. On the main gate of school, it was written. He also supported in the publication of books of other authors in both Unani and other literary works. To name a few Tibbi books, which acknowledge his name are ‘Tarjuma Qarabadin Azam’, ‘Tarjuma Aqsarai’, ‘Tauzih al Advia’, ‘Ilajun Nisan’, Afsana Hikmat’, ‘Tafaruqul Amraz was Tafaruqul Advia’, ‘Moonisul Atibba’ and ‘Usoole Sehat’.

He learned the art of poetry from his teacher ‘Hakim Mohammad Hasan Haziq’ and ‘Isharat Ali Khan Sadq Meeruti’. He once acknowledged, Family history Hakim Syed Karam Husain (1287AH/1870AD – 11th Shawwal 1372 AH/25 June 1953) was a direct descendant of Qazi Syed Rafi Mohammad. He was merely 8 years old when his father Qazi Mir Imdad Ali died. He was trained under the guidance of his mother, Fayyazun Nisan, who was a very talented woman. She inherited all the good qualities from her father, Hussainuddin (died on 11 Dhu al-Hijjah 1278 AH / 1861 AD), a man of horse business from Hyderabad. Hussainuddin also had a good taste in literature. Apart from Fayyazun Nisan, he had another daughter, Bayazun Nisan from his wife Siddiqun Nisan (daughter of Ghulam Askari Ibn Salahuddin ibn Karimuddin ibn Muqtada ibn Qazi Ghulam Murtaza). With family members and friends, Karam Husain went for Hajj pilgrimage from Tijara in January 1934 (1354 AH). With him, his wife (Mrs. Hakimun Nisa), sister (Mrs. Anwari Begum), elder son (Hakim Syed Atiqul Qadir), and others such as Khwaja Kamaluddin (Alias Mian Kallan Shah), Qazi Saeeduddin and Mrs. Zaeefa Khatoon were there. Many of his family members and relatives are remembered for their role and sacrifices in India's First War of Independence.Hakim Karam Husain by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, Masiha, Bombay, India, September 1960, pp. 5-6 After his demise, he was laid to rest adjacent to the grave of his wife Hakimun Nisa, who herself died at the age of 81 years on 14th Rabiulawwal 1370 AH/1950AD, in his family graveyard located at Church Road, Mohallah Jinsi, Bhopal.

Development  The first part of the highway was conceived in 1974 as the Safi-Aqaba Highway. After the highway had reached Safi (in 1977), further plans were developed for a Dead Sea Highway to the north. For a long time however, there was an incomplete section between Mazra'a to Zara. Later, Highway 65 became included in the Jordanian 25-year plan to build an extensive road network which travels around the country. It involves building beltways around major cities such as Irbid, Salt or its capital, Amman. This project's road-improvement investigation is expected to reach US$1.8 billion when complete.

His compositional output includes numerous sacred songs, anthems, and works for organ. He won the American Guild of Organists's Clemson Gold Medal for composition twice. The Canadian Musical Heritage Society has recently reprinted seven of his hymns and the anthem Light's Glittering Morn. Several of his compositions are included in the Catalogue of Printed Music at the British Library in London and many of his original manuscripts are part of the collection at the Library and Archives Canada. Life and career Born in Wolverhampton, Sanders studied at the Royal College of Music (RCM) with Charles Swinnerton Heap (organ), Charles H. Kitson (theory), and Charles W. Perkins (organ). After graduating from the RCM with an associates diploma in 1896, he served as the organist at Camphill Presbyterian Church in Birmingham. He left there after a few years to work in the same capacity at St Mary's Methodist Church in Truro, Cornwall. He also played the violin in a number of orchestras while living in England. In 1907 Sanders emigrated to Canada to assume the post of organist at Chalmers' Presbyterian in Guelph, Ontario. He left there after just one year to assume a similar role at the Dominion Methodist Church in Ottawa where he remained until 1929. While there he toured extensively throughout Canada as an organ recitalist and accompanist and served as the director of the Ottawa Oratorio Society. He was also president of the Ottawa Arts and Letters Club and worked for the Ottawa Journal as a music critic. He was hired by Harry Puddicombe to teach at the Canadian Conservatory of Music and he also ran a private teaching studio. Among his pupils were Kenneth Meek, Charles O'Neill, and Bill Richards. Sanders relocated to Montreal in 1929 to become the music director of the newly built Tudor Hall in the J.A. Ogilvy Department Store, a position he held up until his death nine years later. At the hall he performed several noon-time organ recitals every week and also arranged for appearances by other notable artists. In 1932-1933 he was president of the Royal Canadian College of Organists (RCCO). During the 1930s he also served as the organist of Westmount Park Melville United Church. He died in Montreal in 1938 at the age of 59. As a writer, Sanders contributed articles to numerous musical journals, including Etude, Musical Quarterly, and The American Organist. He was the associate music editor of The Methodist Hymn and Tune Book which was published in 1917; also contributing several of his own hymns to the work. He was the editor of the RCCO's bulletin which was printed in Musical Canada from 1928 to 1933.

It stars Eric McCormack as Christian Gerhartsreiter/Clark Rockefeller and Sherry Stringfield as Sandra Boss. The film is based on the life of Christian Gerhartsreiter, a German con artist who for years impersonated many people, at one point claiming to be part of the Rockefeller family going by the faux name \\"Clark Rockefeller\\", and kidnapping his daughter. Filming took place in Toronto in October 2009 and was released on March 13, 2010 on the Lifetime network to mixed reviews. Plot summary Called \\"the longest running con in FBI history,\\" Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, the man that people knew as \\"Clark Rockefeller\\" (McCormack) had brilliantly impersonated numerous people, ranging from a talk show host to a Pentagon Advisor before ultimately claiming to be an heir to the famous Rockefeller family. Confident from the success of his prior scams, Clark quickly became well known and highly respected among Boston's elite and used his purported high society status to charm his way into the life of Sandra Boss (Stringfield), a millionaire with a Harvard MBA and a partner at the prestigious management consulting firm, McKinsey & Company. Following a whirlwind courtship, the two married and had a daughter, before their rocky 12-year union ended in divorce, leading Clark to abduct his beloved daughter after losing custody to Sandra. With the help of FBI agent Megan Norton (Taylor), Sandra's search for her daughter exposed Clark's lifelong con game for the world to see and ultimately raised questions about the real man and the deception he is capable of. Cast * Eric McCormack as Christian Gerhartsreiter/Clark Rockefeller, a German con artist. In order to prepare for the role, McCormack read everything about Gerhartsreiter's case, studied Natalie Morales's jailhouse interview, and also read his Vanity Fair profile. McCormack said, \\"The dialogue in the scene was based on public record\\". * Sherry Stringfield as Sandra Boss, Gerhartsreiter's ex-wife * Regina Taylor as Megan, a FBI detective * Philip Akin as Det. Lewis Cook * Stephen McHattie as Mark, a FBI detective * Emily Alyn Lind as Reigh (\\"Snooks\\"), Gerhartsreiter and Sandra's daughter Reviews The film was met with mixed reviews. Brian Lowry of Variety said, \\"Who Is Clark Rockefeller? plays a bit like The Great Imposter, only with a woman caught up in the 'She's young, beautiful -- and she married a con man!' scenario in the best Lifetime tradition. Sherry Stringfield stars as the hapless gal, whose character would be more sympathetic if she hadn't agreed to call her daughter 'Snooks'.\\" He went on to praise McCormack's performance by saying, \\"But the real kitsch factor resides in Eric McCormack's performance as the suave charmer, which adds an element of high camp to the proceedings. Mike Hale of The New York Times said in his review that, \\"As a mystery and a police procedural, Who Is Clark Rockefeller? attains glossy mediocrity, but every few minutes Mr. McCormack shows up and says something like, 'You were tedious about money when I married you, and you're still tedious,' and it feels like Will & Grace all over again.\\" He went on to praise Stringfield's performance by saying, \\"[she] gives a dignified, believable performance as Sandra Boss.\\" References Further reading *Mark Seal. \\"The Man in the Rockefeller Suit\\".

Ventrally, it is uniformly yellow. Feeding E. miliaris feeds on a wide range of prey items. They include amphibians (also, eggs and tadpoles), invertebrates, lizards, fish, birds, and small rodents. However, there is little information on its feeding habits.Pizzatto, Lígia; Marques, Otavio A.V. (2006). \\"Interpopulation variation in sexual dimorphism, reproductive output, and parasitism of Liophis miliaris (Colubridae) in the Atlantic forest of Brazil\\". Amphibia-Reptilia 27 (1): 37-46. A study indicated that females with oviductal eggs did not feed, whereas those E. miliaris snakes with secondary vitellogenic follicles fed more often than did the non-reproductive females. Sexual maturity Sexual maturity in snakes is regarded by experts as difficult to determine; however, it can be assessed by the snout-vent length (SVL). Sexual maturity is positively correlated to mean body size. In order to determine the sexual maturity of an Erythrolamprus, scientists have determined the diameter of ovarian follicles if seen to be >10 as indicative of sexual maturity in females, as is the presence of oviducal eggs. Males were considered mature if the testes were large and turgid or if the deferent ducts were opaque and convoluted, indicating the presence of sperm. Females in the subspecies populations of Erythrolamprus miliaris meremmi and Erythrolamprus miliaris orinus were seen to be greater in body size than the males. Sexual dimorphism There is sexual dimorphism with respect to size of adult Erythrolamprus. Adult females are larger in the subspecies merremi and orinus. They were seen to be larger than the adult males. The sexual dimorphism index was seen to be similar in the geographic areas of the northern coastal Atlantic forest, southern coastal Atlantic forest, northern inland Atlantic forest and southern inland Atlantic forest. This was indicative of no geographic variation in sexual size dimorphism. It is believed that body size may differ either because of local genetic modification or direct phenotypic effect of food availability on the growth rates. In addition to body size, the comparison of head size in E. miliaris is seen to show no dimorphism. Head size is considered to be associated with inter-sexual dietary divergence. Reproductive output With respect to reproductive output in the northern and southern coast Atlantic forest, and the northern and southern inland forest, the reproductive output recorded for Erythrolamprus miliaris orinus and Erythrolamprus miliaris merremi were determined via number of eggs, size of eggs, and number of neonates. The mean egg volume in the southern coast Atlantic forest was seen to be the largest of the four regions. The reproductive frequency was lower in the northern coast Atlantic forest than the other regions. Parasitism Parasitism is not understood very well in the context of snake ecology. The only inferences that have been made are those with the influence on natural populations. It is thought to be related to the snakes feeding behavior and immunological resistance. Two parasites were discovered in the subspecies orinus and merremi. The first were adults of Ophidiascaris sp. (Nemaotoda) in the stomach. Also Cystacaths of Oligatanthorynchus spira (Acanthocephala) were in the peritoneum. The prevalence found in the four different regions, northern and southern coastal Atlantic forest and northern and southern inland Atlantic forest, were observed in Pizatto's and Marques' study. The lowest prevalence was seen in the northern coastal Atlantic forest. The level of parasite infestation did not differ between the males and females. Female reproductive status was unaffected by the level of infection, nor was the number of eggs she carried. The male reproductive system was unaffected by the level of infestation as well. Liophis milaris intermedius, a taxonomic error In 1991, Erythrolamprus miliaris intermedius was classified by Henle and Ehrl. However, they made a mistake. It was later discovered by Dixon and Tipton, through various comparisons of body composition, that Erythrolamprus miliaris intermedius was actually Erythrolamprus reginae. Habitat Erythrolamprus miliaris is seen in the Atlantic forest of South America, the rainforest in eastern Brazil, and the semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil.

The mill has been restored to working order. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 23746. History De Westermolen was built in 1845 to drain the Ooster- en Wester- Nieuwkruisland polder. As well as draining the polder, it could also pump water into the polder. The mill worked until 1959, when a stock broke in a storm. Permission was then sought to demolish the mill, but this was refused. On 4 March 1961, the mill was bought by the Gemeente Kollumerland en Nieuwkruisland for ƒ1. The mill was restored at a cost of ƒ7,500. A diesel engine was placed in the mill to work the Archimedes' screw. A further restoration in 1984 by millwright Thijs Jellema of Birdaard saw the diesel engine replaced by an electric motor. Further work by Jellema in 1987 returned the mill to working order. Ownership of the mill had passed to the Monumentenstichting Kollumerland c.a. en Nieuwkruisland by 1996, when further restoration work was carried out. An electrically driven pump now stands next to the mill. Description De Westermolen is what the Dutch describe as a Grondzeiler. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching down almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Common sails. The sails on the inner stock have a span of , while those on the outer stock have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which was cast by Prins van Oranji, 's Gravenhage, in 1870. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 60 cogs. This drives the wallower (33 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel, which has 41 cogs, drives a gearwheel with 42 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the Archimedes' screw is diameter. The screw is diameter . It is inclined at 16.7°. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water. The Archimedes' screw that pumped water into the polder has been removed. Public access De Westermolen is open on Friday mornings. It is also open on Saturday mornings if there is enough wind to work the mill.

This of course led to the further alienation of Anglicans and Puritans from one another in the 17th century during the reign of King James (1603-1625) and the reign of King Charles I (1625-1649), that eventually brought about the English Civil War (1642-1651), the brief rule of the Puritan Lord Protector of England Oliver Cromwell (1653-1658), the English Commonwealth (1649-1660), and as a result the political, religious, and civil liberty that is celebrated today in all English speaking countries. The English Puritan movement in the reign of Elizabeth and beyond, sought to further the work of reforming the church of England, eradicate the influence of Roman Catholicism in the land, as well as promote the national interest of the English crown and the English people under a united Protestant confession that was in strict conformity to the Bible and Reformed theology. This Puritan vision that began in the Elizabethan era would eventually result in the Westminster Assembly, and the Westminster Standards, including Westminster Confession of Faith, the Shorter Catechism, and Larger Catechism, and the Directory for Public Worship. Background, to 1559 Thomas Cranmer (1489–1556), Archbishop of Canterbury, who became increasingly Calvinist throughout the 1540s. The English Reformation began in the 1530s when Henry VIII separated the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church and the authority of the pope. During Henry's reign, Protestants remained a minority of the English population, and Henry alternated between favoring his Protestant advisers and his traditional ones, who wanted to maintain Catholic belief and practices. Protestants were also divided among themselves. By the 1540s, Lutherans and the Swiss Reformed churches were opposed to each other on issues such as predestination and the use of religious images. The Reformed believed that statues, stained glass and pictures in church were idolatrous. They also disliked the use of traditional clerical vestments, preferring their ministers to wear black gowns. The elaborate liturgy of the medieval church was replaced with simple services of prayer and preaching. Unlike the Reformed, the Lutherans believed in the objective, real presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, and they were not opposed to religious imagery and vestments. Many English Protestants were convinced that the Reformed churches were more faithful to biblical Christianity. In the reign of Henry's son, Edward VI, the English Reformation took on a Reformed (or Calvinist) tone. By 1548, leading English Protestants including Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, had adopted Reformed views on the Lord's Supper. Protestant theology was incorporated into a new liturgy contained within the 1549 Book of Common Prayer and even more explicitly in a 1552 revision. Religious processions were banned and clerical marriage was allowed. Prayer for the dead, requiem masses, and the chantry foundations that supported them were abolished. Statues, stained glass windows, and wall paintings in parish churches were destroyed. Roods were replaced with the royal arms of England. In 1553, Edward VI died and his Catholic half-sister assumed the throne as Mary I of England. Mary sought to end the English Reformation and restore the Church of England to full communion with the Church of Rome. Around a thousand English Protestants, known as the Marian exiles, left the country for religious reasons. Unwelcome in German Lutheran territories, the exiles established English Protestant congregations in Rhineland towns, such as Wesel, Frankfurt and Strasbourg, and the Swiss cities of Zurich, Basel, and Geneva. During the exile, English Protestants were exposed to ideas and practices of thoroughly Calvinist churches, such as in Reformation Geneva, and many would seek to implement those ideas in England after Mary's death. The Elizabethan religious settlement, 1559 In 1558, Queen Mary died, and her half-sister, Elizabeth became Queen of England. Elizabeth had been raised as a Protestant in the household of Catherine Parr. During the first year of Elizabeth's reign many of the Marian exiles returned to England. A compromise religious position established in 1559 is now known as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. It attempted to make England Protestant without totally alienating the portion of the population that had supported Catholicism under Mary. The settlement was consolidated in 1563. An interim position of 11 articles of faith operated for a few years. The Church of England under Elizabeth was broadly Reformed in nature: Elizabeth's first Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker had been the executor of Martin Bucer's will, and his replacement, Edmund Grindal had carried the coffin at Bucer's funeral. While the Elizabethan Settlement proved generally acceptable, there remained minorities who were dissatisfied with the state of the Church of England. The cry for \\"further reform\\" in the 1560s was the basis of what is now known as the Puritan Movement. The Puritans were not content with the Anglican settlement and the established church. They believed that the English church and state should be further reformed by the Word of God and the faithful preaching of the Gospel, as in the continental reformed churches. They were opposed to the rule of bishops, to the required use of the Book of Common Prayer, and many of the rituals of the Anglican establishment, which they believed were obstacles to true religion and godliness. They believed the majority of the common people were kept in bondage to forms and rituals, and as a result to false religion and spiritual ignorance. The Puritans moreover wanted all the sins, rituals, and superstitions that \\"smacked of Roman Catholic idolatry\\" thoroughly abolished from the realm and from the churches, including; the mass, the surplice, kneeling at the Lord's Supper, vestments, graven images, profane and sexually immoral stage plays, and the widespread profanation of the Sabbath. The Puritans promoted a thorough going doctrinal reformation that was Calvinistic, as well as a thorough going reformation of the English church and society based on Scripture and not human tradition. The Puritan movement in Elizabethan England was strengthened by the fact that many of Queen Elizabeth's top political advisers and court officials had close ties with Puritan leaders, and were themselves partial to Puritan views of theology, politics, and the reformation of the English church and society. They especially wanted to curb the power of the Anglican bishops and root out any influence of the Roman Catholic church, which were fundamental proponents of the Puritans. Such men in Elizabeth's court of advisers included, William Cecil, Chief Adviser to the Queen, Secretary of State, and Lord High Treasurer; Francis Walsingham, the Principal Secretary to the Queen and Spymaster of the English Crown; Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer; and also Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, a very close personal friend and one time suitor to the Queen. It is evident that Elizabeth herself, though a committed Anglican, relied heavily on Puritan leaders for the support of the crown as well as her own personal and state counsel. The chief poet of the Elizabethan era, Edmund Spenser, was himself a promoter of Puritan views. He is best known for The Faerie Queene, an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the reign of Elizabeth I. In fact the Red Cross Knight, the chief hero of the poem is designed to be the very image and model of Puritan virtue, and Una his betrothed a figure of the church purified from sin and idolatry. The delicate balance, and conflict, between Anglicanism and Puritanism, could be readily seen in one of the primary architects of the Anglican settlement, John Jewel. Jewel can be seen in many ways as both Anglican and Puritan, much like William Perkins at the end of the Elizabethan era. John Jewel's Apology for the Church of England and his Book of Homilies are both quintessential Anglicanism; and yet his \\"Essay on Holy Scripture\\" is in many ways Puritan. Fundamental to the rise of English Puritanism in the Elizabethan era (1558-1603) was the influence of four highly influential reformers: John Calvin, Henry Bullinger, Peter Martyr, and Theodore Beza, who were all in frequent communication with the crown and the reformed leaders in England. While Calvin and Bullinger praised Queen Elizabeth for the work of reformation in England and the Anglican establishment, and encouraging patience from the Puritans, Beza was more firm in his support of the Puritan movement. During the 1560s and 1570s, the works of Calvin were the most widely disseminated publications in England, while the works of Beza, Bullinger, and Vermigli also enjoyed popularity. It must not be forgotten that the Puritan movement in Elizabethan England was also furthered by the work and ministry of John Knox and the Scottish Reformation that took place at the same time. John Knox of course spent five years in England (1549-1554) assisting the English reformation in the time of Edward VI, fled to Geneva and spent several years with Calvin (1554-1559), and then returned to Scotland to spearhead the reformation of his home country from 1560 until his death in 1572. Knox's influence on the Puritan movement in England was significant, and is still being debated today by historians and scholars alike. The British pastor and Puritan scholar Martyn Lloyd-Jones in fact suggests that John Knox could be called the first Puritan. Archiepiscopate of Matthew Parker, 1559–1575 Cambridge professor William Fulke (1538–1589) encouraged his students not to wear their required vestments. =Convocation of 1562/3= The Convocation of 1563 restored the position of the Thirty-Nine Articles in the Church of England (more accurately said, the Forty-Two Articles of Edward VI were reduced to a draft at this point, which was widely supported, and eventually enforced after 1571). There were further proposals from reformers, in particular on canon law and liturgy, some of which originated from a group among the bishops. These, however, proved contentious, and did not pass. Subsequent contestation of the same matters made some of the issues a matter of authority. Convocation opened on 15 January 1562/3 with a sermon by William Day; he was one of leaders, prominent with Alexander Nowell (who had preached the day before at the opening of Parliament) and Thomas Sampson, of the reformers. Further reforms put forward included: 1) a reduction in the number of saints' days; 2) the elimination of vestments; 3) the elimination of kneeling at communion; 4) the elimination of \\"emergency baptism\\" of sickly newborns; and 5) the elimination of organs from churches. The emerging \\"Puritan\\" faction achieved nothing in the direction of such goals at the 1563 Convocation. Some of the clergy introduced these reforms in their congregations on their own initiative, in the following years. For example, at Cambridge, William Fulke convinced his students not to wear their surplices and to hiss at students who did. In this situation, Archbishop Parker published a set of Advertisements, requiring uniformity in clerical dress. =Vestiarian Controversy, 1563–1569= The Puritan faction objected loudly, and appealed to the continental reformers to support their cause. Unfortunately for the Puritans many of the continental reformers felt that the Puritans were just making trouble - for example, in a letter to Bishop Grindal, Heinrich Bullinger accused the Puritans of displaying \\"a contentious spirit under the name of conscience\\". Grindal proceeded to publish the letter without Bullinger's permission. Theodore Beza was more supportive of the Puritan position, though he did not intervene too loudly because he feared angering the queen and he wanted the queen to intervene in France on behalf of the Huguenots. In response to clergymen refusing to wear their vestments, 37 ministers were suspended. In response, in 1569, some ministers began holding their own services, the first example of Puritan separatism. = The Admonition to the Parliament (1572) and the demand for Presbyterianism = Throughout the 1560s, England's return to Protestantism remained tentative, and large numbers of the people were committed to and sought a return to Catholicism. Three related events around 1570 ultimately led to the reinforcement of Protestantism in England. First, in the Rising of the North, the northern earls revolted, demanding a return to Catholicism. Second, after the execution of the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, Pope Pius V issued the bull Regnans in Excelsis, absolving Catholics of their duty of allegiance to Elizabeth. Third, the Ridolfi plot sought to replace Elizabeth with the Mary, Queen of Scots. In response to this Catholic rebelliousness, the English government took several measures to shore up the Protestantism of the regime. First, all clergymen were required to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles. Second, all laity were required to take communion according to the rite of the Book of Common Prayer in their home parish at least once a year. And third, it became a treasonable offence to say that the queen was a heretic or a schismatic. John Foxe (1517-1587) was a Puritan most famous for his book Foxe's Book of Martyrs, which chronicled the Marian Persecutions. In 1570, Foxe called for further reforms to the Church of England, but was rebuffed by the queen. In this pro-Protestant, anti-Catholic environment, the Puritan faction sought to push further reforms on the Church of England. John Foxe and Thomas Norton presented a reform proposal initially drawn up under Edward VI to Parliament. Elizabeth quickly dismissed this proposal, however, insisting on adherence to the 1559 religious settlement. Meanwhile, at Cambridge, professor Thomas Cartwright, a long-time opponent of vestments, offered a series of lectures in 1570 on the Book of Acts in which he called for the abolition of episcopacy and the creation of a presbyterian system of church governance in England. Puritans were further dismayed when they learned that the bishops had decided to merge the vestarian controversy into the requirement that clergy subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles: at the time they swore their allegiance to the Thirty-Nine Articles, the bishops also required all clergymen to swear that the use of the Book of Common Prayer and the wearing of vestments are not contrary to Scripture. Many of the Puritan clergymen were incensed at this requirement. A bill authorizing the bishops to permit deviations from the Book of Common Prayer in cases where the Prayer Book required something contrary to a clergyman's conscience was presented and defeated at the next parliament. Meanwhile, at Cambridge, Vice-Chancellor John Whitgift moved against Thomas Cartwright, depriving Cartwright of his professorship and his fellowship in 1571. Under these circumstances, in 1572, two London clergymen - Thomas Wilcox and John Field - penned the first classic expression of Puritanism, their Admonition to the Parliament. According to the Admonition, the Puritans had long accepted the Book of Common Prayer, with all its deficiencies, because it promoted the peace and unity of the church. Thomas Cartwright (1535-1603), the leader of the Presbyterian movement in England during the reign of Elizabeth IHowever, now that the bishops required them to subscribe to the Book of Common Prayer, the Puritans felt obliged to point out the popery and superstition contained in the Prayer Book. The Admonition went on to call for more thorough church reforms, modelled on the reforms made by the Huguenots or by the Church of Scotland under the leadership of John Knox. The Admonition ended by denouncing the bishops and calling for the replacement of episcopalianism with presbyterianism. The Admonition to Parliament set off a major controversy in England. John Whitgift wrote an Answer denouncing the Admonition, which in turn led to Thomas Cartwright's Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgift Agaynste the Admonition to the Parliament (1573), a second Puritan classic. Cartwright argued that a properly reformed church must contain the four orders of ministers identified by Calvin: teaching elders, ruling elders, deacons and theological professors. Cartwright went on to denounce the subjection of any minister in the church to any other minister in the strongest possible terms. In a Second Replye, Cartwright was even more forceful, arguing that any pre- eminence accorded to any minister in the church violated divine law. Furthermore, he went on to assert that a presbyterian hierarchy of presbyteries and synods was required by divine law. In 1574, Walter Travers, an ally of Cartwright, published a Full and Plaine Declaration of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, setting forth a scheme of reform in greater detail than Cartwright had. The government moved against all three of these Puritan leaders: John Field and Thomas Wilcox were imprisoned for a year, while Thomas Cartwright fled to exile on the continent to avoid such a fate. In the end, however, the number of clergymen who refused to subscribe to the bishops' requirements proved to be too large, and a number of qualified subscriptions were allowed. Archiepiscopate of Edmund Grindal, 1575–1583 The reign of Edmund Grindal as Archbishop of Canterbury (1575–1583) was relatively tranquil compared with that of his predecessor. The major issue came in 1581, when Robert Browne and his congregation at Bury St Edmunds withdrew from communion in the Church of England, citing the Church of England's dumb (i.e. non- preaching) ministry, and the lack of proper church discipline. Browne and his followers, known as the Brownists, were forced into exile in the Low Countries. There, they were encouraged by Thomas Cartwright, who was now serving as minister to the Merchant Adventurers at Middelburg. Cartwright, however, opposed separatism). Like most Puritans, he advocated further reforms to the Church of England from within. A second Puritan development under Grindal was the rise of the Puritan prophesying, modelled on the Zurich Prophezei (Puritans learned of the practice through the congregation of refugees from Zurich established in London), where ministers met weekly to discuss \\"profitable questions\\". These \\"profitable questions\\" included the correct use of Sabbath, an initial sign of the Sabbatarianism of the English Puritans. The queen objected to the growth of the conventicling movement and ordered Archbishop Grindal to suppress. When Grindal refused, citing I Cor. 14, he was disgraced and placed under virtual house arrest for the rest of his tenure as Archbishop. The conventicles resumed after a brief period of suspension. Archiepiscopate of John Whitgift, 1583–1604 John Whitgift had been a vocal opponent of Thomas Cartwright. He believed that the matter of church governance was adiaphora, a \\"matter indifferent\\", and that the church should accommodate with the state in which the church was located. The Church of England was located in a monarchy, so the church should adopt an episcopal style of government. =Renewed calls for Presbyterianism= Andrew Melville (1545–1622), a Scottish churchman who came to England to avoid the effect of Scotland's Black Acts of 1583–85, and who encouraged the English Puritans to seek further reforms to the Church of England The years 1583-1585 saw the brief ascendancy in Scotland of James Stewart, who claimed the title of Earl of Arran. This period saw Scotland pass the Black Acts, which outlawed the Second Book of Discipline. As a response, many Scottish ministers, including Andrew Melville, sought refuge in England. These refugees participated in the English conventicles (as did John Field, now released from prison) and convinced many English Puritans that they should renew their fight to establish presbyterianism in England. As such, in the 1584 Parliament, Puritans introduced legislation to replace the Book of Common Prayer with the Genevan Book of Order and to introduce presbyterianism. This effort failed. At this point, John Field, Walter Travers, and Thomas Cartwright were all free and back in England and determined to draft a new order for the Church of England. They drafted a Book of Discipline, which circulated in 1586, and which they hoped would be accepted by the 1586 Parliament. Again, the Puritan effort failed in Parliament. =Martin Marprelate, 1588–89, and response= In 1588–89, a series of virulently anti-episcopal tracts were published under the pseudonym of Martin Marprelate. These Marprelate tracts, likely published by Job Throckmorton and Welsh publisher John Penry, denounced the bishops as agents of Antichrist, the strongest possible denunciation for Christians. The Marprelate tracts called the bishops \\"our vile servile dunghill ministers of damnation, that viperous generation, those scorpions.\\" Unfortunately for the Puritans, the mid- to late-1580s saw a number of the defenders of the Puritans in the English government die: Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford in 1585; Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1588; and Francis Walsingham in 1590. In these circumstances, Richard Bancroft (John Whitgift's chaplain) led a crackdown against the Puritans. Cartwright and eight other Puritan leaders were imprisoned for eighteen months, before facing trial in the Star Chamber. The conventicles were disbanded. Some Puritans followed Robert Browne's lead and withdrew from the Church of England. A number of those separatists were arrested in the woods near Islington in 1593, and John Greenwood and Henry Barrowe were executed for advocating separatism. Followers of Greenwood and Barrowe fled to the Netherlands, and would form the basis of the Pilgrims, who would later found the Plymouth Colony. 1593 also saw the English parliament pass the Religion Act (35 Elizabeth c. 1) and the Popish Recusants Act (35 Elizabeth c. 2), which provided that those worshipping outside the Church of England had three months in which to either conform to the Church of England or else abjure the realm, forfeiting their lands and goods to the crown, with failure to abjure being a capital offence. Although these acts were directed against Roman Catholics who refused to conform to the Church of England, on their face they also applied to many of the Puritans. Although no Puritans were executed under these laws, they remained a constant threat and source of anxiety to the Puritans. =The drive to create a preaching ministry= Sir Walter Mildmay (bef. 1523–1589), who founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584 to promote the training of Puritan ministers. One of the most important aspects of the Puritan movement was its insistence on having a preaching ministry throughout the country. At the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, less than 10 per cent of the 40,000 English parish clergy was licensed to preach. (Since the time of the repression of the Lollards in the 14th century, it had been illegal for an ordained parish priest to preach to his congregation without first obtaining a licence from his bishop.) Elizabeth herself had been no fan of preaching and preferred a church service focused on the Prayer Book liturgy. However, many of Elizabeth's bishops did support the development of a preaching ministry and, aided by wealthy laymen, were able to dramatically expand the number of qualified preachers in the country. For example, Sir Walter Mildmay founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584 to promote the training of preaching ministers. The great Puritan preacher and scholar Laurence Chaderton was the principal of the college. He was close friends and associates of Thomas Cartwright, Richard Rogers, Richard Greenham, John Dod, and William Perkins, each of which had a major influence on the rise of English Puritanism. Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex similarly founded Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1596. Emmanuel and Sidney Sussex became the homes of academic Puritanism. Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex (1531–1589), who founded Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1596 to promote the training of Puritan ministers Although the number of preachers increased dramatically over the course of Elizabeth's reign, there were still insufficient preachers in the country. A layman who wanted to hear a sermon might have to travel to another parish in order to find one with a preaching minister. When he got there, he might find that the preaching minister had shortened the Prayer Book service to allow more time for preaching. And, as a trained minister, when he did pray, he was more likely to offer an extemporaneous prayer instead of simply reading the set prayer out of the Prayer Book. Thus we see two different styles developing in the Church of England: a traditional style, focused on the liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer; and the Puritan style, focused on preaching, with less ceremony and shorter or extemporaneous prayers. One of the greatest of the Elizabethan puritan preachers was Henry Smith, whose eloquence in the pulpit won him the epithet Silver-tongued Smith. =The rise of \\"experimental predestinarianism\\"= Following the suppression of Puritanism in the wake of the Marprelate Tracts, Puritans in England assumed a more low-key approach in the 1590s. Ministers who favoured further reforms increasingly turned their attention away from structural reforms to the Church of England, instead choosing to focus on individual, personal holiness. Theologians such as William Perkins of Cambridge continued to maintain the rigorously high standards of previous Puritans, but now focused their attention on improving individual, as opposed to collective, righteousness. A characteristic Puritan focus during this period was for more rigorous keeping of the Christian Sabbath. William Perkins is also credited with introducing Theodore Beza's version of double predestination to the English Puritans, a view which he popularized through the use of a chart he created known as \\"The Golden Chain\\". William Perkins (1558–1602), a Puritan theologian who espoused strict moral standards during the reign of Elizabeth I and championed \\"experimental predestinarianism\\" In 1970, R. T. Kendall labelled the form of religion practised by William Perkins and his followers as experimental predestinarianism, a position that Kendall contrasted with credal predestinarianism. Kendall identified credal predestinarians as anyone who accepted the Calvinist teaching on predestination. Experimental predestinarians, however, went beyond merely adhering to the doctrine of predestination, teaching that it was possible for individuals to know experimentally that they were saved and a member of God's elect predestined for eternal life. (The credal predestinarians believed that only some group were destined for eternal life, but that it was impossible in this life to identify who was elect and who was reprobate.) Puritans who adopted Perkins' brand of experimental predestinarianism felt obliged, once they had undergone a religious process to attain knowledge of their election, to seek out like- minded individuals who had undergone similar religious experiences. In time, some Puritan clergymen and laity, who increasingly referred to themselves as \\"the godly\\", began to view themselves as distinct from the regular members of the Church of England, who had not undergone an emotional conversion experience. At times, this tendency led for calls for \\"the godly\\" to separate themselves from the Church of England. While the majority of Puritans remained \\"non-separating Puritans\\", they nevertheless came to constitute a distinct social group within the Church of England by the turn of the 17th century. In the next reign (King James), \\"the Puritan\\" as a type was common enough that fiercely Anglican playwright Ben Jonson could satirize Puritans in the form of the characters Tribulation and Ananais in The Alchemist (1610) and Zeal-of- the-land Busy in Bartholomew Fair (1614). So by the end of the Elizabethan era, Anglican and Puritan factions were at times in deep conflict, as many of the Puritans themselves would often satirize the Anglican church, with its rituals and bishops as being subversive of true religion and godliness. At the same time the Puritan movement had ministers and magistrates that held to either congregational, presbyterial, and episcopal forms of church government. The climax and the brilliance of the Elizabethan Puritan movement can be especially seen in three of the greatest men of that era and their works: 1. The theological treatises of William Perkins. 2. The sermons of Henry Smith. And 3. The poetry of Edmund Spenser.

This eventually led to the further alienation of Anglicans and Puritans from one another in the 17th century during the reign of King Charles I (1625-49), that eventually brought about the English Civil War (1642-51), the brief rule of the Puritan Lord Protector of England Oliver Cromwell (1653-58), the English Commonwealth (1649-60), and as a result the political, religious, and civil liberty that is celebrated today in all English speaking countries. King James was brought up in Scotland under the influence of strict Scottish Calvinist tutors, like George Buchanan, who sought to instill in him a commitment to the Protestant cause in Scotland. When he became the King of both England and Scotland, James sought to keep the Church of England strictly under his monarchical rule and the power of episcopacy, previously established under Elizabeth. King James held strong convictions on the Divine right of kings, and even wrote a book on the subject. To that end, he continued to suppress many of the important aspects of the Puritan movement, including the many Puritan's Congregationalist and Presbyterian views of Church government. The King knew though that he needed the Puritans to strengthen the Protestant establishment in England, as well as every aspect of the nation's prosperity and success. To that end, King James supported and even advanced many of the Puritan pastors, academics, and gentry, just as Queen Elizabeth did, if and when they were willing to work with the Anglican establishment under the authority of the bishops. For this reason, the Puritan movement continued to grow and expand throughout England in remarkable ways under the reign of King James. To be sure the Puritan movement in England was considerably strengthened on account of the succession of the three Archbishops of Canterbury who served under King James. Archbishop John Whitgift (1583-1604), appointed by Queen Elizabeth sought to suppress the Puritan movement. Archbishop Richard Bancroft (1604-1610) chief overseer of the production of the King James Bible also sought to suppress the Puritan reform movement, but was forced to increasingly rely upon them because of the Catholic threat. Archbishop George Abbot (1611-1633) was actually often supportive of the Puritans and their designs for reform, promoting them to high ecclesiastical and academic appointments. For this reason Abbot was often spoken of at times as \\"the Puritan Archbishop.\\" One of the greatest accomplishments of Puritans and Anglicans together during the reign of King James was the translation of the King James Bible (1611); arguably one of the greatest historical, literary, and theological achievements of the western world. It was also during the reign of King James that Puritans and Anglicans worked together at the Synod of Dordt (1618-1619), an international conference of reformed theologians that drew up the Canons of Dordt in defense of the Five Points of Calvinism, refuting the Arminian heresy. It was moreover during the reign of King James that the Pilgrim movement within the reformed churches separated from the Church of England and began their colonizing venture in America known as the Plymouth Colony (1620) under the leadership of William Bradford and William Brewster. These great achievements of the Puritan movement in England under King James shows how widespread the influence of Puritanism was at this time, and how they adapted to the King's authority in different ways. Some of them sought to work within the establishment, like William Perkins, Master of Emmanuel College; while others left the Church of England and ventured elsewhere, like William Ames who spent much of his career in Holland. The English Puritan movement that began in the reign of Elizabeth, and grew in strength and influence in England during the reign of King James sought to further the work of reforming the church of England, eradicate the influence of Roman Catholicism in the land, as well as promote the national interest of the English crown and the English people under a united Protestant confession that was in strict conformity to the Bible and Reformed theology. This Puritan vision that began in the Elizabethan era would eventually result in the Westminster Assembly, and the Westminster Standards, including Westminster Confession of Faith, the Shorter Catechism, and Larger Catechism, and the Directory for Public Worship. Under James I of England, the Puritan movement co-existed with the conforming Church of England in what was generally an accepted form of episcopal Protestant religion. This equilibrium was disturbed towards the end of this period by several new developments, doctrinal from the Synod of Dort, political from the discussion of the Spanish Match shortly after the outbreak of the Thirty Years War, and internal to the Church with a partial shift of views away from Calvinism. Separatists who had never accepted King James's settlement of religious affairs began migrating to New England colonies, from the Netherlands as well as England. The Millenary Petition (1603) and the Hampton Court Conference (1604) Elizabeth I died in March 1603; she was succeeded by James VI of Scotland, who had been King of Scots since the abdication of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1567 (when James was 1 year old). James had little contact with his mother and was raised by guardians in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. John Knox had led the Scottish Reformation, beginning in 1560, and the Church of Scotland looked broadly like the type of church that the Puritans wanted in England. In his 1599 book Basilikon Doron, the king had had harsh words for Puritans, but his criticisms seemed directed at the most extreme of the Puritans and it seemed likely that the king would agree to moderate reforms. Throughout 1603, Puritan ministers collected signatures for a petition, known as the Millenary Petition because it was signed by 1,000 Puritan ministers. The Petition was careful not to challenge the royal supremacy in the Church of England, and called for a number of church reforms to remove ceremonies perceived as popish: The Millenary Petition was presented to James in Leicester so he couldn't discuss the terms with the Bishops. # The use of the sign of the cross in baptism (which Puritans saw as superstitious); # The rite of confirmation (which Puritans criticized because it was not found in the Bible); # The performance of baptism by midwives (which Puritans argued was based on a superstitious belief that infants who died without being baptized could not go to heaven); # The exchanging of rings during the marriage ceremony (again seen as unscriptural and superstitious); # The ceremonious bowing at the Name of Jesus during worship (again seen as superstitious); # The requirement that clergy wear surplice as it wasn't mentioned in the Bible; and # The custom of clergy living in the church building. The Petition argued that a preaching minister should be appointed to every parish (instead of one who simply read the service from the Book of Common Prayer). In opposition to Archbishop John Whitgift's policy that clergy must subscribe to the Book of Common Prayer and the use of vestments, the Petition argued that ministers should only be required to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles and the royal supremacy. Finally, the Petition called for the ending of episcopacy, and the setting up of a presbyterian system of church governance. King James (1566-1625) disappointed the Puritans by agreeing to only modest reform proposals at the 1604 Hampton Court Conference. James I, who had studied theology, and who enjoyed debating theological points, agreed to hold a conference at Hampton Court Palace, where supporters and opponents of the Millenary Petition could debate the merits of reforms to the church. After being postponed due to an outbreak of the plague, the Hampton Court Conference was held in January 1604. The king chose four Puritans to represent the Puritan cause: John Rainolds (president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford), Laurence Chaderton (master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge), Thomas Sparke, and John Knewstubs. Archbishop Whitgift led a delegation of eight bishops (including Whitgift's protégé, Richard Bancroft, Bishop of London), seven deans, and two other clergymen in opposition to the Puritans. At the first meeting of the Conference, held January 14, James met only with Archbishop Whitgift's party. On the second day, January 16, he met with the Puritans - this day of the conference ended badly for the Puritans when Rainolds mentioned the Puritan proposal for creating presbyteries in England. James viewed the proposal to replace bishops with presbyteries as an attempt to diminish his power in the church. As such, James issued his famous maxim \\"No bishop, no king!\\" on this occasion, before ending the day's meeting early. On January 18, the king initially met with Whitgift's party and an assemblage of ecclesiastical lawyers, before calling in the Puritans to hear his verdict. James declared that the use of the Book of Common Prayer was to continue, and made no provisions for a preaching ministry. He did, however, approve a few changes in the Book of Common Prayer: 1) the mention of baptism by midwives was to be eliminated; 2) the term \\"absolution\\" (which Puritans associated with the Catholic sacrament of penance, which was rejected by Protestants) was replaced by the term \\"remission of sins\\"; 3) confirmation was renamed \\"laying on of hands\\" to dissociate it from its Catholic sacramental meaning; and 4) a few other minor changes. James also announced that he agreed to support the Puritan project for a new, authorized translation of the Bible, thus setting the stage for the production of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611. Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1604-1610 Following the death of John Whitgift, James selected Richard Bancroft as his replacement as Archbishop of Canterbury. Bancroft had argued against the Puritans at the Hampton Court Conference, and his selection signalled the end to reforms. Shortly after his selection, Bancroft presented a book of canons to the Convocation of the English Clergy; these canons received royal approval and as such became part of the Church of England's canon law. The Parliament of England, which in 1559 had passed the Act of Uniformity approving the Book of Common Prayer, claimed that Parliament, not Convocation, was the body authorized to pass new canon law. Puritans argued that the bishops were attempting to aggrandize themselves at the Parliament's expense. In the end, James acceded to Parliament's demand, and withdrew the book of canons. The 1604 parliament marks the first time that the Puritans had allied themselves with the cause of Parliament over against the cause of the bishops. Over the next several decades, this alliance would become one of the most pronounced features of English politics, and would form the basis of the divisions in the English Civil War in the 1640s. The discovery of the Gunpowder Plot led to a period of particularly virulent anti-Catholicism. Since the Puritans were the hawks against Catholics, they enjoyed some cachet in this period. Nevertheless, their reform proposals were successfully blocked by Bancroft. George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1611-1633 George Abbot (1562-1633), Archbishop of Canterbury, whom some historians have called \\"the Puritan Archbishop.\\" Following Archbishop Bancroft's death in 1610, James chose George Abbot as his successor. James re-introduced bishops (abolished at the time of the Scottish Reformation) into the Church of Scotland, though with less power than bishops elsewhere, and serving essentially as the permanent chairman of a presbytery. In 1608, Abbot had impressed James after he accompanied George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar to Scotland as part of his efforts to unify the English and Scottish churches, and James had named Abbot Bishop of Lichfield in 1609. James intended Abbot's appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury to further his project of unifying the English and Scottish churches. While each Archbishop of Canterbury since Matthew Parker had been a Calvinist, Abbot is generally regarded as \\"The Calvinist Archbishop\\" or even as \\"The Puritan Archbishop\\", and is the closest the Puritans ever got to seeing an Archbishop of Canterbury endorse their proposals. (The one issue on which Abbot was distinctly non-Puritan was the issue of episcopacy - Abbot was one of the most vocal proponents of the doctrine of apostolic succession in the Church of England.) =The King James or Authorized Version of the Bible, 1611= In 1611 the King James or Authorized version of the English Bible, begun in 1604, was published. It was essentially an official Anglican work, but there were many Puritans who contributed to the translation. It was first printed by Robert Barker, the King's Printer, and was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities: The first had been the Great Bible, commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII (1535), and the second had been the Bishops' Bible, commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1568). In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference, where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans, who preferred the Geneva Bible. The King James version slowly took over the place of the Geneva Bible had among the Puritans. The KJV of the Bible translation is noted for its \\"majesty of style\\", and has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world. =The Book of Sports Controversy, 1617= It had long been a custom in England that Sunday mornings were dedicated to Christian worship, and were then followed by sports and games on Sunday afternoons. The Puritans loudly objected to the practice of Sunday sports, believing that playing games on Sabbath constituted a violation of the Fourth Commandment. Their Sabbatarian views became much stronger than in other European Reformed churches. Nineteenth-century illustration showing parishioners \\"keeping Sunday\\" in a way approved by the Book of Sports. Although the Puritans did not necessarily object to these sports and games in general, they did object to allowing them on Sundays. In the early seventeenth century, Puritans came to dominate several localities and managed to succeed in banning Sunday sports. In 1617, in Lancashire, there was a particularly intense quarrel between the Puritans and the local gentry (many of whom were Catholic recusants) over the issue of Sunday sports. In response to the controversy raging in his diocese, Thomas Morton, Bishop of Chester, asked the king for a ruling on the propriety of Sunday sports. In response King James issued the Book of Sports, a declaration declaring that it was lawful to play some sports on Sundays, but not others. Criticizing the opinions of \\"puritans and precise people\\", the Book listed archery, dancing, \\"leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreation\\" as permissible sports for Sundays. It forbade bear-baiting, bull- baiting, \\"interludes\\" and bowling. The king commanded all Anglican ministers to read the Book of Sports to their congregations, but Archbishop Abbot contradicted him, and ordered his clergy not to read the Book of Sports. =The Five Articles of Perth, 1618= In 1618, King James proposed the Five Articles of Perth, which imposed English practices on the Scottish church. The Five Articles required: # kneeling at Communion; # provisions allowing for private baptism; # provisions allowing reservation of the sacrament for the ill; # only a bishop was allowed to administer the rite of confirmation; and # the Church of Scotland, which had previously abolished all holy days, was obliged to accept some holy days. The Five Articles of Perth were ultimately accepted by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, though a sizable minority of Scottish Presbyterians objected. The Articles of Perth appeared to English Puritans to be heading in the wrong direction. =The Pilgrims and the Planting of Plymouth Colony, 1620= In 1620, a group of Puritan separatists, known today as the Pilgrims, made their famous sea voyage on the Mayflower across the Atlantic to settle Plymouth Colony. They were led by governor William Bradford and church elder William Brewster. The Pilgrims were originally a part of the Puritan separatist movement in England. They began to feel the pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation therefore left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden. In Leiden, the congregation gained the freedom to worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. And so they made preparations to settle a new colony in America. The first settlement of the Plymouth Colony was at New Plymouth, a location previously surveyed and named by Captain John Smith. The settlement served as the capital of the colony and developed as the modern town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of the modern state of Massachusetts. It was one of the earliest successful colonies to be founded by the English in North America, along with Jamestown and other settlements in Virginia, and was the first sizable permanent English settlement in the New England region. The colony was able to establish a treaty with Chief Massasoit which helped to ensure its success; in this, they were aided by Squanto, a member of the Patuxet tribe. By 1691 Plymouth Colony and the Pilgrim colonists, eventually merged with the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony under John Winthrop (established in 1628), and other territories to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. =The Thirty Years War and the Controversy over the Spanish Match, 1623-1624= King James saw himself as the potential peacemaker of Europe, and his propaganda portrayed him as the modern Solomon. In religion the Church of England could provide a model middle ground, and in his view both Catholics and Protestants would be able to accept churches modeled after it. Richard Hooker (1554-1600) opposed the Puritans' efforts to further reform the Church of England. King James, who saw himself as the Peacemaker of Europe, agreed with Hooker, and promoted a middle ground between Catholicism and Protestantism as the solution to Europe's problems. In this regard, he subscribed to the theory that the Church of England represented a via media or middle way between Protestantism and Catholicism. When his son Charles became old enough to marry, James mused about marrying Charles to a Catholic princess. The Thirty Years' War broke out in 1618, and English Protestants demanded that James intervene, on behalf of his son-in-law Frederick V, Elector Palatine. James initially refused, but in 1620 was forced to call a parliament to raise funds to support an expedition on behalf of Frederick: this was the first parliament James had called since the 1614 Addled Parliament. Parliament led by Edward Coke refused to grant adequate funds for this expedition unless the king agreed that his son would marry a Protestant. James responded that Parliament had no business interfering in matters of royal prerogative. Parliament responded by passing a protest, asserting its ancient rights. At the urging of his favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and of the Spanish ambassador Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, 1st Count of Gondomar, James tore this protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament. Buckingham had gained considerable influence, not only over James, but also over Prince Charles. In 1623, he convinced the 23-year-old Charles that England should ally with Spain and that Prince Charles should marry a Spanish princess. The two thus sailed for Spain so that Charles could court Maria Anna of Spain, daughter of Philip III of Spain. This proposed marriage is known to history as the Spanish Match. The Spanish Match was wildly unpopular among English Protestants, and allowed Puritan conspiracy theories a great deal of credibility: Puritans argued that the Spanish Match was part of a plot to restore England to Catholicism. When James called another parliament in 1623, the anti-Catholic outpouring was so virulent that it was obvious the parliament would agree to none of the king's requests. Meanwhile, in Spain, the Spanish insisted that they would only agree to the Spanish Match if Charles agreed to convert to Catholicism and agree to spend a year receiving Catholic instruction in Spain. Under the circumstances, Charles ultimately declined the Spanish Match in 1624. His return to England was greeted with widespread celebrations and treated as a national holiday. In response to his rebuff by Spain, Charles came to favour alliance with France and war with Spain. At the Puritan-dominated 1624 parliament, the parliament impeached Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, the minister most associated with advocacy in favour of the Spanish Match. The parliament agreed to fund a war with Spain in principle, though they did not actually allocate funding for the war. =The rise of the Arminian party and the New Gagg controversy (1624)= King James was a lifelong doctrinal Calvinist, and when the Quinquarticular Controversy broke out in the Dutch Republic in the years following the death of theologian Jacobus Arminius in 1609, James supported the Calvinist Gomarists against the Arminian Remonstrants. James handpicked British delegates sent to the 1618 Synod of Dort and concurred in the outcome of the Synod. But James was increasingly faced with Puritan opposition (over the Book of Sports, the Five Articles of Perth, the Spanish Match, etc.), he began to seek out clerics who would be more supportive of his ecumenical ecclesiastical plans. Since the reign of Elizabeth, England had contained a number of theologians who opposed the extreme predestinarian views in the high Calvinism propounded by Theodore Beza and accepted by the Puritans. For example, Peter Baro, the Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, had opposed Archbishop Whitgift's attempts to impose the Calvinistic Lambeth Articles on the Church of England in 1595. Several of Baro's disciples at Cambridge - notably Lancelot Andrewes, John Overall, and Samuel Harsnett - had repeated Baro's criticisms of predestination in terms roughly equivalent to those propounded by Arminius. When James was looking for anti-Puritan allies, he found this party willing, and, although few members of this party actually accepted the Arminian position tout court, they were quickly labeled \\"the Arminian party\\" by the Puritans. In 1624, when a hitherto obscure Cambridge scholar, Richard Montagu, obtained royal permission to publish A New Gagg for an Old Goose. The book was framed as a rebuttal of a Catholic critique of the Church of England. In response, Montagu argued that the Calvinist positions objected to were held only by a small, Puritan minority in the Church of England, and that the majority of clergy in the Church of England rejected high Calvinism. A New Gagg was of major importance in the history of the Puritans, in that it marked the first time they had ever been associated with a doctrinal position (as opposed to a question of proper practice). For example, George Carleton, Bishop of Chichester, who had been an English delegate at the Synod of Dort, was shocked to find his doctrinal position being equated with Puritanism. By the end of the reign of King James in 1625, Puritanism had established itself in England as a revolutionary religious and political movement. The Puritans had come to influence every institution of English society and had spread as well to the continent in Holland as well as the American colonies in the Plymouth Colony. The Puritans had moreover come to control most of the English Parliament. The Puritan movement would grow even stronger under King Charles I, and even for a time come to take control of England with the English Commonwealth and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, following the English Civil War. But it was certainly under the rule of King James (1604-1625) where the Puritan movement found great momentum.

Opponents of the royal prerogative became allies of Puritan reformers, who saw the Church of England moving in a direction opposite to what they wanted, and objected to increased Catholic influence both at Court and (as they saw it) within the Church. After the First English Civil War political power was held by various factions of Puritans. The trials and executions of William Laud and then King Charles himself were decisive moves shaping British history. While in the short term Puritan power was consolidated by the Parliamentary armed forces and Oliver Cromwell, in the same years, the argument for theocracy failed to convince enough of the various groupings, and there was no Puritan religious settlement to match Cromwell's gradual assumption of dictatorial powers. The distinctive formulation of Reformed theology in the Westminster Assembly would prove to be its lasting legacy. In New England, immigration of what were Puritan family groups and congregations was at its peak for the period the middle years of King Charles's reign. From the Synod of Dort to the death of Archbishop Abbot (1618-1633) For around a dozen years, before Laudianism in the Church of England became the movement directly opposed by Puritans (clergy and laymen), there was a growing confrontation between Puritanism and \\"Arminians\\", a term less easy to define in an English context. Arminians in this sense were moderates on, or even opposed to, some key tenets of Calvinism. In the same period the Twelve Years' Truce ended, and the Thirty Years' War broke out, changing the international situation in Western Europe drastically. James I of England generally supported the Counter-Remonstrant position against the Dutch Arminians (see History of Calvinist–Arminian debate). In fact James had contributed to the hounding of Conrad Vorstius, and sent a strong delegation to the Synod of Dort, making it an important international Protestant council and underlining the condemnation of Vorstius (successor to Jacobus Arminius) as a heretic. It was only in the period of the proposed Spanish match that James tried to adopt a less anti-Catholic approach, offending many Puritan figures in so doing. \\"Arminian\\" in English usage was not such a precise theological term, in fact, and James's views allowed for some diversity. Charles, Prince of Wales, became king on the death of his father James I in 1625. Charles was distrustful of Puritans, who began defining themselves against \\"Arminian\\" moderates on church and foreign policy, simply as an opposition group, believing as he did in the Divine Right of Kings and lacking his father's deftness in these matters. Charles had no particular interest in theological questions, but preferred the emphasis on order, decorum, uniformity, and spectacle in Christian worship. Whereas James had supported the Canons of the Synod of Dort, Charles forbade preaching on the subject of predestination altogether. Where James had been lenient towards clergy who omitted parts of the Book of Common Prayer, Charles urged the bishops to enforce compliance with the Prayer Book, and to suspend ministers who refused. William Laud (1573–1645), Bishop of St David's (1622–1626), Bishop of Bath and Wells (1626–1633), and Archbishop of Canterbury (1633–1645). Laud was one of King Charles's closest advisors, and the architect of the Laudian church policies which were deeply distasteful to the Puritans. Besides George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Charles's closest political advisor was William Laud, the Bishop of St David's, whom Charles translated to the better position of Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1626. Under Laud's influence, Charles shifted the royal ecclesiastical policy markedly. =Conflict between Charles I and Puritans, 1625–1629= In 1625, shortly before the opening of the new parliament, Charles was married by proxy to Henrietta Maria of France, the Catholic daughter of Henry IV of France. In diplomatic terms this implied alliance with France in preparation for war against Spain, but Puritan MPs openly claimed that Charles was preparing to restrict the recusancy laws. The king had indeed agreed to do so in the secret marriage treaty he negotiated with Louis XIII of France. John Pym (1584–1643), Puritan MP who spoke out against Richard Montagu in 1625. George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1611, was in the mainstream of the English church, sympathetic with Scottish Protestants, anti-Catholic in a conventional Calvinist way, and theologically opposed to Arminianism. Under Elizabeth I he had associated with Puritan figures. The controversy over Richard Montagu's anti-Calvinist New Gagg was still open when Parliament met in May 1625. Puritan MP John Pym launched an attack on Richard Montagu in the House of Commons. As a response, Montagu wrote a pamphlet entitled Appello Caesarem (Latin \\"I Appeal to Caesar\\") (a reference to Acts 25:10–12), to Charles to protect him against the Puritans. Charles responded by making Montagu a royal chaplain, signaling that he was willing to defend Montagu against Puritan opposition. The Parliament was reluctant to grant Charles revenue, since they feared that it might be used to support an army that would re-impose Catholicism on England. The 1625 Parliament broke the precedent of centuries and voted to allow Charles to collect Tonnage and Poundage only for one year. When Charles wanted to intervene in the Thirty Years' War by declaring war on Spain (the Anglo- Spanish War (1625)), Parliament granted him an insufficient sum of £140,000. The war with Spain went ahead (partially funded by tonnage and poundage collected by Charles after he was no longer authorized to do so). Buckingham was put in charge of the war effort, but failed. The York House conference of 1626 saw battle lines start to be drawn up. Opponents cast doubt on the political loyalties of the Puritans, equating their beliefs with resistance theory. In their preaching, Arminians began to take a royalist line. Abbot was deprived of effective power in 1627, in a quarrel with the king over Robert Sibthorpe, one such royalist cleric. Richard Montagu was made Bishop of Chichester in 1628. The Anglo-French War (1627–1629) was also a military failure. Parliament called for Buckingham's replacement, but Charles stuck by him. Parliament went on to pass the Petition of Right, a declaration of Parliament's rights. Charles accepted the Petition, though this did not lead to a change in his behaviour. =The King's personal rule= In August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated by a disillusioned soldier, John Felton. Public reaction angered Charles. When Parliament resumed sitting in January 1629, Charles was met with outrage over the case of John Rolle, an MP who had been prosecuted for failing to pay Tonnage and Poundage. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, was held down in the Speaker's Chair in order to allow the House to pass a resolution condemning the king. Charles determined to rule without calling a parliament, thus initiating the period known as his Personal Rule (1629–1640). This period saw the ascendancy of Laudianism in England. =Laudianism= The central ideal of Laudianism (the common name for the ecclesiastical policies pursued by Charles and Laud) was the \\"beauty of holiness\\" (a reference to Psalm 29:2). This emphasized a love of ceremony and harmonious liturgy. Many of the churches in England had fallen into disrepair in the wake of the English Reformation: Laudianism called for making churches beautiful. Churches were ordered to make repairs and to enforce greater respect for the church building. A policy particularly odious to the Puritans was the installation of altar rails in churches, which Puritans associated with the Catholic position on transubstantiation: in Catholic practice, altar rails served to demarcate the space where Christ became incarnate in the host, with priests, acolytes, and altar boys allowed inside the rail. They also argued that the practice of receiving communion while kneeling at the rail too much resembled Catholic Eucharistic adoration. The Laudians insisted on kneeling at communion and receiving at the rail, denying that this involved accepting Catholic positions . Puritans also objected to the Laudian insistence on calling members of the clergy \\"priests\\". In their minds, the word \\"priest\\" meant \\"someone who offers a sacrifice\\", and was therefore related in their minds to Catholic teaching on the Eucharist as a sacrifice. After the Reformation, the term \\"minister\\" (meaning \\"one who serves\\") was generally adopted by Protestants to describe their clergy; Puritans argued in favor of its use, or else for simply transliterating the Koine Greek word presbyter used in the New Testament, without translation. The Puritans were also dismayed when the Laudians insisted on the importance of keeping Lent, a practice which had fallen into disfavor in England after the Reformation. They favored fast days specifically called by the church or the government in response to the problems of the day, rather than days dictated by the ecclesiastical calendar. The foundation of Puritan New England, 1630–1642 :For more information, see History of the Puritans in North America. Some Puritans began considering founding their own colony where they could worship in a fully reformed church, far from King Charles and the bishops. This was a quite distinct view of the church from that held by the Separatists of Plymouth Colony. John Winthrop, a lawyer who had practiced in the Court of Wards, began to explore the idea of creating a Puritan colony in New England. The Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony had proved that such a colony was viable. In 1627, the existing Dorchester Company for New England colonial expansion went bankrupt, but was succeeded by the New England Company (the membership of the Dorchester and New England Companies overlapped). Throughout 1628 and 1629, Puritans in Winthrop's social circle discussed the possibility of moving to New England. The New England Company sought clearer title to the New England land of the proposed settlement than was provided by the Sheffield Patent, and in March 1629 succeeded in obtaining from King Charles a royal charter changing the name of the company to the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England and granting them the land to found the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The royal charter establishing the Massachusetts Bay Company had not specified where the company's annual meeting should be held; this raised the possibility that the governor of the company could move to the new colony and serve as governor of the colony, while the general court of the company could be transformed into the colony's legislative assembly. John Winthrop participated in these discussions and in March 1629, signed the Cambridge Agreement, by which the non-emigrating shareholders of the company agreed to turn over control of the company to the emigrating shareholders. As Winthrop was the wealthiest of the emigrating shareholders, the company decided to make him governor, and entrusted him with the company charter. John Winthrop (1587/8-1649), Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who led the Puritans in the Great Migration, beginning in 1630. Winthrop sailed for New England in 1630 along with 700 colonists on board eleven ships known collectively as the Winthrop Fleet. Winthrop himself sailed on board the Arbella. During the crossing, he preached a sermon entitled \\"A Model of Christian Charity\\", in which he called on his fellow settlers to make their new colony a City upon a Hill,A reference to Matthew 5:14–16 meaning that they would be a model to all the nations of Europe as to what a properly reformed Christian commonwealth should look like. The context in 1630 was that the Thirty Years' War was going badly for the Protestants, and Catholicism was being restored in lands previously reformed – e.g. by the 1629 Edict of Restitution. Emigration was officially restricted to conforming churchmen in December 1634 by the Privy Council. William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1633–1643 In 1633 there died the moderate George Abbot, and Charles I chose William Laud as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot had been in practical terms suspended from his functions in 1617 after he refused to order his clergy to read the Book of Sports. Charles now re-issued the Book of Sports, in a symbolic gesture of October 1633 against sabbatarianism. Laud further ordered his clergy to read it to their congregations, and acted to suspend ministers who refused to do that, an effective shibboleth to root out Puritan clergy. The 1630s saw a renewed concern by bishops of the Church of England to enforce uniformity in the church, by ensuring strict compliance with the style of worship set out in the Book of Common Prayer. The Court of High Commission came to be the primary means for disciplining Puritan clergy who refused to conform. Unlike regular courts, in the Court of High Commission, there was no right against self-incrimination, and the Court could compel testimony. Some bishops went further than the Book of Common Prayer, and required their clergy to conform to levels of extra ceremonialism. As noted above, the introduction of altar rails to churches was the most controversial such requirement. Puritans were also dismayed by the re- introduction of images (e.g. stained glass windows) to churches which had been without religious images since the iconoclasm of the Reformation. =Silencing of Puritan laymen= William Prynne (1600–1669), Puritan politician who opposed the policies of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and had his ears cut off as a result... Henry Burton (1578–1648). ... as did John Bastwick (1593–1654)... The ejection of non-conforming Puritan ministers from the Church of England in the 1630s provoked a reaction. Puritan laymen spoke out against Charles's policies, with the bishops the main focus of Puritan ire. The first, and most famous, critic of the Caroline regime was William Prynne. In the late 1620s and early 1630s, Prynne had authored a number of works denouncing the spread of Arminianism in the Church of England, and was also opposed to Charles's marrying a Catholic. Prynne became a critic of morals at court. Prynne was also a critic of societal morals more generally. Echoing John Chrysostom's criticism of the stage, Prynne penned a book, Histriomastix, in which he denounced the stage in vehement terms for its promotion of lasciviousness. The book, which represents the highest point of the Puritans' attack on the English Renaissance theatre, attacked the stage as promoting lewdness. Unfortunately for Prynne, his book appeared at about the same time that Henrietta Maria became the first royal to ever perform in a masque, Walter Montagu's The Shepherd's Paradise, in January 1633. Histriomastix was widely read as a Puritan attack on the queen's morality. Shortly after becoming Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud prosecuted Prynne in the Court of Star Chamber on a charge of seditious libel. Unlike the common law courts, Star Chamber was allowed to order any punishment short of the death penalty, including torture, for crimes which were founded on equity, not on law. Seditious libel was one of the \\"equitable crimes\\" which were prosecuted in the Star Chamber. Prynne was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment, a £5000 fine, and the removal of part of his ears. Prynne continued to publish from prison, and in 1637, he was tried before Star Chamber a second time. This time, Star Chamber ordered that the rest of Prynne's ears be cut off, and that he should be branded with the letters S L for \\"seditious libeller\\". (Prynne would maintain that the letters really stood for stigmata Laudis (the marks of Laud).) At the same trial, Star Chamber also ordered that two other critics of the regime should have their ears cut off for writing against Laudianism: John Bastwick, a physician who wrote anti- episcopal pamphlets; and Henry Burton. John Lilburne (1614–1657), Puritan layman who, in 1638 gained national frame as \\"Freeborn John\\" for his defense of himself when called before Star Chamber to defend his importing unlicensed publications from Amsterdam. A year later, the trio of \\"martyrs\\" were joined by a fourth, John Lilburne, who had studied under John Bastwick. Since 1632, it had been illegal to publish or import works of literature not licensed by the Stationers' Company, and this allowed the government to view and censor any work prior to publication. Over the course of the 1630s, it became common for Puritans to have their works published in Amsterdam and then smuggled into England. In 1638, Lilburne was prosecuted in Star Chamber for importing religious works critical of Laudianism from Amsterdam. Lilburne thus began a course which would see him later hailed as \\"Freeborn John\\" and as the pre- eminent champion of \\"English liberties\\". In Star Chamber, he refused to plead to the charges against him on the grounds that the charges had been presented to him only in Latin. The court then threw him in prison and again brought him back to court and demanded a plea. Again, Lilburne demanded to hear in English the charges brought against him. The authorities then resorted to flogging him with a three-thonged whip on his bare back, as he was dragged by his hands tied to the rear of an oxcart from Fleet Prison to the pillory at Westminster. He was then forced to stoop in the pillory where he still managed to distributing unlicensed literature to the crowds. He was then gagged. Finally he was thrown in prison. He was taken back to the court and again imprisoned. =Suppression of the Feoffees for Impropriations= Richard Sibbes (1577–1635) served as one of the Feoffees for Impropriations, who were organized in 1625 to support Puritanism in the Church of England, and which were dissolved with their assets forfeited to the crown in 1632. Beginning in 1625, a group of Puritan lawyers, merchants, and clergymen (including Richard Sibbes and John Davenport) organized an organization known as the Feoffees for the Purchase of Impropriations. The feoffees would raise funds to purchase lay impropriations and advowsons, which would mean that the feoffees would then have the legal right to appoint their chosen candidates to benefices and lectureships. Thus, this provided a mechanism both for increasing the number of preaching ministers in the country, and a way to ensure that Puritans could receive ecclesiastical appointments. In 1629, Peter Heylin, a Magdalen don, preached a sermon in St Mary's denouncing the Feoffees for Impropriations for sowing tares among the wheat. As a result of the publicity, William Noy began to prosecute feoffees in the Exchequer court. The feoffees' defense was that all of the men they had had appointed to office conformed to the Church of England. Nevertheless, in 1632, the Feoffees for Impropriations were dissolved and the group's assets forfeited to the crown: Charles ordered that the money should be used to augment the salary of incumbents and used for other pious uses not controlled by the Puritans. =The Bishops' Wars, 1638–1640= As noted above, James had tried to bring the English and Scottish churches closer together. In the process, he had restored bishops to the Church of Scotland and forced the Five Articles of Perth on the Scottish church, moves which upset Scottish Presbyterians. Charles now further angered the Presbyterians by elevating the bishops' role in Scotland even higher than his father had, to the point where in 1635, the Archbishop of St Andrews, John Spottiswoode, was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Presbyterian opposition to Charles reached a new height of intensity in 1637, when Charles attempted to impose a version of the Book of Common Prayer on the Church of Scotland. Although this book was drawn up by a panel of Scottish bishops, it was widely seen as an English import and denounced as Laud's Liturgy. What was worse, where the Scottish prayer book differed from the English, it seemed to be re-introducing old errors which had not yet been re-introduced in England. As a result, when the newly appointed Bishop of Edinburgh, David Lindsay, rose to read the new liturgy in St. Giles' Cathedral, Jenny Geddes, a member of the congregation, threw her stool at Lindsay, thus setting off the Prayer Book Riot. Jenny Geddes throws her stool at David Lindsay, Bishop of Edinburgh, in 1637, setting off the Prayer Book Riot which would ultimately lead to the First Bishops' War. The Scottish prayer book was deeply unpopular with Scottish noblemen and gentry, not only on religious grounds, but also for nationalist reasons: Knox's Book of Common Order had been adopted as the liturgy of the national church by the Parliament of Scotland, whereas the Scottish parliament was not consulted in 1637 and the new prayer book imposed solely on the basis of Charles' alleged royal supremacy in the church, a doctrine which had never been accepted by either the Church or Parliament of Scotland. A number of leading noblemen drew up a document known as the National Covenant in February 1638. Those who subscribed to the National Covenant are known as Covenanters. Later that year, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ejected the bishops from the church. In response to this challenge to his authority, Charles raised an army and marched on Scotland in the \\"First Bishops' War\\" (1639). The English Puritans – who had a longstanding opposition to the bishops (which had reached new heights in the wake of the Prynne, Burton, Bastwick, and Lilburne cases) – were deeply dismayed that the king was now waging a war to maintain the office of bishop. The First Bishops' War ended in a stalemate, since both sides lacked sufficient resources to defeat their opponents (in Charles' case, this was because he did not have enough revenues to wage a war since he had not called a Parliament since 1629), which led to the signing of the Treaty of Berwick (1639). The blue banner carried into battle by the Covenanters from 1639. Charles intended to break the Treaty of Berwick at the next opportunity, and upon returning to London, began preparations for calling a Parliament that could pass new taxes to fund a war against the Scots and to re-establish episcopacy in Scotland. This Parliament – known as the Short Parliament because it only lasted three weeks – met in 1640. Unfortunately for Charles, many Puritan members were elected to the Parliament, and two critics of royal policies, John Pym and John Hampden, emerged as loud critics of the king in the Parliament. These members insisted that Parliament had an ancient right to demand the redress of grievances and insisted that the nation's grievances with the past ten years of royal policies should be dealt with before Parliament granted Charles the taxes that he wanted. Frustrated, Charles dissolved Parliament three weeks after it opened. In Scotland, the rebellious spirit continued to grow in strength. Following the signing of the Treaty of Berwick, the General Assembly of Scotland met in Edinburgh and confirmed the abolition of episcopacy in Scotland, and then went even further and declared that all episcopacy was contrary to the Word of God. When the Scottish Parliament met later in the year, it confirmed the Church of Scotland's position. The Scottish Covenanters now determined that Presbyterianism could never be confidently re-established in Scotland so long as episcopacy remained the order of the day in England. They therefore determined to invade England to help bring about the abolition of episcopacy. At the same time, the Scots (who had many contacts among the English Puritans) learned that the king was intending to break the Treaty of Berwick and make a second attempt at invading Scotland. When the Short Parliament was dissolved without having granted Charles the money he requested, the Covenanters determined that the time was ripe to launch a preemptive strike against English invasion. As such, in August 1640, the Scottish troops marched into northern England, beginning the \\"Second Bishops' War\\". Catching the king unawares, the Scots gained a major victory at the Battle of Newburn. The Scottish Covenanters thus occupied the northern counties of England and imposed a large fine of £850 a day on the king until a treaty could be signed. Believing that the king was not trustworthy, the Scottish insisted that the Parliament of England be a part of any peace negotiations. Bankrupted by the Second Bishops' War, Charles had little choice but to call a Parliament to grant new taxes to pay off the Scots. He therefore reluctantly called a Parliament which would not be finally dissolved until 1660, the Long Parliament. =The Canons of 1640 and the Et Cetera Oath= Title page of the Canons of 1640, which were passed by the Convocation of the English Clergy at the behest of King Charles and Archbishop Laud and which were detested by the Puritans. The Convocation of the English Clergy traditionally met whenever Parliament met, and was then dissolved whenever Parliament was dissolved. In 1640, however, Charles ordered Convocation to continue sitting even after he dissolved the Short Parliament because the Convocation had not yet passed the canons which Charles had had Archbishop Laud draw up and which confirmed the Laudian church policies as the official policies of the Church of England. Convocation dutifully passed these canons in late May 1640. The preamble to the canons claims that the canons are not innovating in the church, but are rather restoring ceremonies from the time of Edward VI and Elizabeth I which had fallen into disuse. The first canon asserted that the king ruled by divine right; that the doctrine of Royal Supremacy was required by divine law; and that taxes were due to the king \\"by the law of God, nature, and nations.\\" This canon led many MPs to conclude that Charles and the Laudian clergy were attempting to use the Church of England as a way to establish an absolute monarchy in England, and felt that this represented unwarranted clerical interference in the recent dispute between Parliament and the king over ship money. Canons against popery and Socinianism were uncontroversial, but the canon against the sectaries was quite controversial because it was clearly aimed squarely at the Puritans. This canon condemned anyone who did not regularly attend service in their parish church or who attended only the sermon, not the full Prayer Book service. It went on to condemn anyone who wrote books critical of the discipline and government of the Church of England. Finally, and most controversially, the Canons imposed an oath, known to history as the Et Cetera Oath, to be taken by every clergyman, every Master of Arts not the son of a nobleman, all who had taken a degree in divinity, law, or physic, all registrars of the Consistory Court and Chancery Court, all actuaries, proctors and schoolmasters, all persons incorporated from foreign universities, and all candidates for ordination. The oath read The Puritans were furious. They attacked the Canons of 1640 as unconstitutional, claiming that Convocation was no longer legally in session after Parliament was dissolved. The campaign to enforce the Et Cetera Oath met with firm Puritan resistance, organized in London by Cornelius Burges, Edmund Calamy the Elder, and John Goodwin. The imposition of the Et Cetera Oath also resulted in the Puritans' pro-Scottish sympathies becoming even more widespread, and there were rumours – possible but never proven – that Puritan leaders were in treasonable communication with the Scottish during this period. Many Puritans refused to read the prayer for victory against the Scottish which they had been ordered to read. =The Long Parliament attacks Laudianism and considers the Root and Branch Petition, 1640–42= In the early days of the Long Parliament, Puritans led the charge in the impeachment of both Archbishop Laud and Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. This 19th-century painting by Paul Delaroche shows Laud reaching his hands from his cell in the Tower of London to offer Strafford a blessing shortly before Strafford's execution in May 1641. Laud would subsequently be executed in 1645. The elections to the Long Parliament in November 1640 produced a Parliament which was even more dominated by Puritans than the Short Parliament had been. Parliament's first order of business was therefore to move against Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who had served as Charles' Lord Deputy of Ireland since 1632. In the wake of the Second Bishops' War, Strafford had been raising an Irish Catholic army in Ireland which could be deployed against the Scottish Covenanters. Puritans were appalled that an army of Irish Catholics (whom they hated) would be deployed by the crown against the Scottish Presbyterians (whom they loved), and many English Protestants who were not particularly puritanical shared the sentiment. Having learned that Parliament intended to impeach him, Strafford presented the king with evidence of treasonable communications between Puritans in Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters. Nevertheless, through deft political manoeuvering, John Pym, along with Oliver St John and Lord Saye, managed to quickly have Parliament impeach Strafford on charges of high treason and Strafford was arrested. At his trial before the House of Lords, begun in January 1641, prosecutors argued that Strafford intended to use the Irish Catholic army against English Protestants. Strafford responded that the army was intended to be used against the rebellious Scots. Strafford was ultimately acquitted in April 1641 on the grounds that his actions did not amount to high treason. As a result, Puritan opponents of Strafford launched a bill of attainder against Strafford in the House of Commons; in the wake of a revolt by the army, which had not been paid in months, the House of Lords also passed the bill of attainder. Charles, worried that the army would revolt further if they were not paid, and that the army would never be paid until Parliament granted funds, and that Parliament would not grant funds without Strafford's death, signed the bill of attainder in May 1641. Strafford was executed before a crowd of 200,000 on 12 May 1641. The Puritans took advantage of Parliament's and the public's mood and organized the Root and Branch Petition, so called because it called for the abolition of episcopacy \\"root and branch\\". The Root and Branch Petition signed by 15,000 Londoners was presented to Parliament by a crowd of 1,500 on 11 December 1640. The Root and Branch Petition detailed many of the Puritans' grievances with Charles and the bishops. It complained that the bishops had silenced many godly ministers and made ministers afraid to instruct the people about \\"the doctrine of predestination, of free grace, of perseverance, of original sin remaining after baptism, of the sabbath, the doctrine against universal grace, election for faith foreseen, freewill against Antichrist, non-residents (ministers who did not live in their parishes), human inventions in God's worship\\". The Petition condemned the practices of bestowing temporal power on bishops and encouraging ministers to disregard temporal authority. The Petition condemned the regime for suppressing godly books while allowing the publication of popish, Arminian, and lewd books (such as Ovid's Ars Amatoria and the ballads of Martin Parker). The Petition also restated several of the Puritans' routine complaints: the Book of Sports, the placing of communion tables altar-wise, church beautification schemes, the imposing of oaths, the influence of Catholics and Arminians at court, and the abuse of excommunication by the bishops. Oliver St John (c1598-1673), who drew up the Root and Branch Bill, which would have finally abolished episcopacy. The bill was introduced in Parliament by Henry Vane the Younger and Oliver Cromwell in May 1641, and defeated in August 1641. In December 1640, the month after it impeached Strafford, Parliament had also impeached Archbishop Laud on charges of high treason. He was accused of subverting true religion, assuming pope-like powers, attempting to reconcile the Church of England with the Roman Catholic Church, persecuting godly preachers, ruining the Church of England's relations with the Reformed churches on the Continent, promoting the war with Scotland, and a variety of other offenses. During this debate, Harbottle Grimston famously called Laud \\"the roote and ground of all our miseries and calamities ... the sty of all pestilential filth that hath infected the State and Government.\\" Unlike Strafford, however, Laud's enemies did not move quickly to secure his execution. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in February 1641. In March 1641, the House of Commons passed the Bishops Exclusion Bill, which would have prevented the bishops from taking their seats in the House of Lords. The House of Lords, however, rejected this bill. In May 1641, Henry Vane the Younger and Oliver Cromwell introduced the Root and Branch Bill, which had been drafted by Oliver St John and which was designed to root out episcopacy in England \\"root and branch\\" along the lines advocated in the Root and Branch Petition. Many moderate MPs, such as Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland and Edward Hyde, were dismayed: although they believed that Charles and Laud had gone too far in the 1630s, they were not prepared to abolish episcopacy. The debate over the Root and Branch Bill was intense – the Bill was finally rejected in August 1641. The division of MPs over this bill would form the basic division of MPs in the subsequent war, with those who favoured the Root and Branch Bill becoming Roundheads and those who defended the bishops becoming Cavaliers. Edmund Calamy the Elder (1600–1666), the \\"E.C.\\" in Smectymnuus, a group of Puritans who wrote in response to Bishop Hall's defense of episcopacy in 1641. Unsurprisingly the debate surrounding the Root and Branch Bill occasioned a lively pamphlet controversy. Joseph Hall, the Bishop of Exeter, wrote a spirited defense of episcopacy entitled An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament. This drew forth a response from five Puritan authors, who wrote under the name Smectymnuus, an acronym based on their names (Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and William Spurstow). Smectymnuus's first pamphlet, An Answer to a booke entituled, An Humble Remonstrance. In Which, the Original of Liturgy and Episcopacy is Discussed, was published in March 1641. It is believed that one of Thomas Young's former students, John Milton, wrote the postscript to the reply. (Milton published several anti-episcopal pamphlets in 1640–41). A prolonged series of answers and counter-answers followed. Worried that the king would again quickly dissolve Parliament without redressing the nation's grievances, John Pym pushed through an Act against Dissolving Parliament without its own Consent; desperately in need of money, Charles had little choice but to consent to the Act. The Long Parliament then sought to undo the more unpopular aspects of the past eleven years. Star Chamber, which had been used to silence Puritan laymen, was abolished in July 1641. The Court of High Commission was also abolished at this time. Parliament ordered Prynne, Burton, Bastwick, and Lilburne released from prison, and they returned to London in triumph. In October 1641, Irish Catholic gentry launched the Irish Rebellion of 1641, throwing off English domination and creating Confederate Ireland. English parliamentarians were terrified that an Irish army might rise to massacre English Protestants. In this atmosphere, in November 1641, Parliament passed the Grand Remonstrance, detailing over 200 points which Parliament felt that the king had acted illegally in the course of the Personal Rule. The Grand Remonstrance marked a second moment at which a number of the more moderate, non-Puritan members of Parliament (e.g. Viscount Falkland and Edward Hyde) felt that Parliament had gone too far in its denunciations of the king and was showing too much sympathy for the rebellious Scots. When the bishops attempted to take their seats in the House of Lords in late 1641, a pro-Puritan, anti- episcopal mob, probably organized by John Pym, prevented them from doing so. The Bishops Exclusion Bill was re-introduced in December 1641, and this time, the mood of the country was such that neither the House of Lords nor Charles felt strong enough to reject the bill. The Bishops Exclusion Act prevented those in holy orders from exercising any temporal jurisdiction or authority after 5 February 1642; this extended to taking a seat in Parliament or membership of the Privy Council. Any acts carried out with such authority after that date by a member of the clergy were to be considered void. In this period, Charles became increasingly convinced that a number of Puritan- influenced members of Parliament had treasonously encouraged the Scottish Covenanters to invade England in 1640, leading to the Second Bishops' War. As such, when he heard that they were planning to impeach the Queen for participation in Catholic plots, he determined to arrest Lord Mandeville as well as five MPs, known to history as the Five Members: John Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, Sir Arthur Haselrig, and William Strode. Charles famously entered the House of Commons personally on 4 January 1642, but the members had already fled. Following his failed attempt to arrest the Five Members, Charles realized that he was not only immensely unpopular among parliamentarians, he was also in danger of London's pro-Puritan, anti- episcopal, and increasingly anti-royal mob. As such, he and his family retreated to Oxford and invited all loyal parliamentarians to join him. He began raising an army under George Goring, Lord Goring. Puritans in Parliament were now in a sticky situation: on the one hand, they wanted to raise an army to defend England against the Irish Catholics who were rebelling; on the other hand, they were worried that the king could not be trusted and that if he were given control of the army, he would use it against the Scots, not the Irish. To avoid this problem, Parliament began appointing Lord Lieutenants, a function traditionally done only by the king. Then, Parliament passed a Militia Ordinance which raised a militia, but provided that the militia should be controlled by Parliament. The king, of course, refused to sign this bill. A major split between Parliament and the king occurred on 15 March 1642, when Parliament declared that \\"the People are bound by the Ordinance for the Militia, though it has not received the Royal Assent\\", the first time a Parliament had declared its acts to operate without receiving royal assent. Under these circumstances, the political nation began to divide itself into Roundheads and Cavaliers. The first clash between the royalists and the parliamentarians came in the April 1642 Siege of Hull, which began when the military governor appointed by Parliament, Sir John Hotham refused to allow Charles' forces access to military material in Kingston upon Hull. In August, the king officially raised his standard at Nottingham and the First English Civil War was underway. The Westminster Assembly, 1643–49 William Twisse (1578–1646), who was elected as the first Prolocutor of the Westminster Assembly in 1643, and who held that position until his death. In 1642, the most ardent defenders of episcopacy in the Long Parliament left to join King Charles on the battlefield. However, although Civil War was beginning, Parliament was initially reluctant to pass legislation without it receiving royal assent. Thus, between June 1642 and May 1643, Parliament passed legislation providing for a religious assembly five times, but these bills did not receive royal assent and thus died. By June 1643, however, Parliament was willing to defy the king and call a religious assembly without the king's assent. This assembly, the Westminster Assembly, had its first meeting in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey on 1 July 1643. (In later sessions, the Assembly would meet in the Jerusalem Chamber.) The Assembly was charged with drawing up a new liturgy to replace the Book of Common Prayer and with determining what manner of church polity was appropriate for the Church of England. In both cases, it was assumed that the Westminster Assembly would only make recommendations and that Parliament would have the final word. The Long Parliament appointed 121 divines to the Westminster Assembly (at the time \\"divine\\", i.e. theologian, was used as a synonym for \\"clergyman\\"). Of these, approximately 25 never showed up – mainly because King Charles ordered all loyal subjects not to participate in the Assembly. To replace the divines who had failed to show up, Parliament later added 21 additional divines, known as the \\"Superadded Divines\\". The Assembly also included 30 lay assessors (10 nobles and 20 commoners). Although the Westminster Divines were mainly Puritan, they were broadly representative of all positions (except Laudianism) then on offer in the Church of England. James Ussher (1581–1656), Archbishop of Armagh, who pushed for a moderate form of episcopacy at the Westminster Assembly. Samuel Rutherford (c1600-1661), Scottish Commissioner to the Westminster Assembly, who played a crucial role in ensuring that the Assembly ultimately came out in favour of presbyterianism. Thomas Goodwin (1600–1680), one of the \\"Five Dissenting Brethren\\" and a leader of the Independents in the Westminster Assembly. John Lightfoot (1602–1675) believed that ecclesiastical polity was not a matter of a divine law and that the church should be subordinate to the state, a position known as Erastianism at the Westminster Assembly. For its first ten weeks, the Westminster Assembly's only task was to revise the Thirty-Nine Articles. However, in summer 1643, shortly after the calling of the Westminster Assembly, the Parliamentary forces, under the leadership of John Pym and Henry Vane the Younger concluded an agreement with the Scots known as the Solemn League and Covenant. As noted above, one of the main reasons why the Scots had launched the Second Bishops War in 1640 was because they hoped to bring about an end to episcopacy in England. They therefore insisted as a term of the agreement that the English agree to fight to extirpate \\"popery and prelacy\\". Since the Puritans were also interested in fighting these things, they readily agreed, and the Long Parliament agreed to swear to the Scottish National Covenant. Six Commissioners representing the Church of Scotland were now sent to attend the Westminster Assembly and on 12 October 1643, the Long Parliament ordered the Assembly to \\"confer and treat among themselves of such a discipline and government as may be most agreeable to God's holy word, and most apt to procure and preserve the peace of the church at home, and nearer agreement with the Church of Scotland and other Reformed Churches abroad.\\" =Parties at the Westminster Assembly= The Westminster Assembly's discussions on church polity mark a definitive turning point in Puritan history. Whereas Puritans had hitherto been united in their opposition to royal and episcopal ecclesiastical policies, they now became divided over the form that reforms to the Church of England should take. The Westminster Divines divided into four groups: # The Episcopalians, who supported a moderate form of episcopal polity and who were led by James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh; # The Presbyterians, who favoured presbyterian polity – this position was pushed hard by the Scottish Commissioners, especially George Gillespie and Samuel Rutherford, while the most influential Englishman taking this position was probably Edward Reynolds; # The Independents, who favoured congregationalist polity and who were led by Thomas Goodwin; and # The Erastians, who believed that ecclesiastical polity was adiaphora, a matter indifferent, which ought to be determined by the state, and who were led by John Lightfoot. Many issues divided the groups from each other: * Was the matter of ecclesiastical polity jure divino (established by divine law) or adiaphora (a matter indifferent, with each national church free to establish its own polity)? The Erastians were the most vocal party in arguing that polity was not fixed by divine law, while the other groups were more likely to believe that their positions were dictated by the Scriptures. * What amount of hierarchy was proper in the church? The Episcopalians believed that the church should be hierarchically organized, with the bishops providing a supervisory role over other clergy. The Presbyterians believed that the church should be organized hierarchically only in the sense that the church should be governed by a series of hierarchically ordered assemblies (Sessions, Presbyteries, Synods, and at the top the General Assembly). While the Presbyterian scheme involved hierarchical ordering in the church, its proponents stressed that it did not involve a hierarchical ordering among individuals in the church, since at each level, the governing body represented the church as a whole. The Independents opposed all forms of hierarchy in the church and argued that ministers should be accountable only to their own local congregations. * What was the proper relationship of church and state? All parties at the Westminster Assembly rejected what was held to be the \\"papist\\" position, that church and state should be unified, but with the state subordinate to the church. The Erastians and many of the Episcopalian party maintained that church and state should be unified, but with the church subordinate to the state, a position traditionally known as caesaropapism (and expressed, for example, in the doctrine of the royal supremacy). The Presbyterians argued for complete separation of church and state, but nevertheless felt that the state should enforce religious uniformity in the country. The Independents went furthest of all, arguing that there should be not only separation of church and state, but also religious liberty. * How uniform should the church's liturgy be? Those inclined to episcopalianism were most inclined to favour a liturgy similar to the Book of Common Prayer, just revised to make it acceptable to more extreme Puritans, but still containing set forms of prayers that would be used uniformly throughout the country. Those inclined to presbyterianism were more likely to favour something akin to Knox's Book of Discipline, which set out the general form of worship, but which left individual ministers free to compose their own prayers, and even to offer extemporaneous prayer. The Independents were more likely to oppose all set forms of worship, were okay with local variation in the form of worship, and felt that almost all prayer should be extemporaneous, offered spontaneously by the minister as he was moved by the Holy Spirit at the time of service. =The Independents Controversy, 1644= Even after the Royalists failed to turn up for the Westminster Assembly, the Episcopalians were probably in the majority or at least the plurality. However, the Episcopalian members of the Assembly proved less than zealous in their defense of episcopacy: when the Assembly scheduled debates and votes for the late afternoon and early evening, the Episcopalian members failed to attend, allowing the Presbyterians and Independents to dominate the Assembly's debates. In a famous bon mot, Lord Falkland observed that \\"those that hated the bishops hated them worse than the devil and those that loved them loved them not so well as their dinner.\\" Upon their arrival, the Scottish Commissioners – Alexander Henderson, George Gillespie, Samuel Rutherford, and Robert Baillie – organized a campaign to have the Church of England adopt a presbyterian system similar to the Church of Scotland. It initially appeared that the Scottish Commissioners might be able to push through their presbyterian scheme with only minimal resistance. Jeremiah Burroughs (c1600-1646), one of the Five Dissenting Brethren who supported the Independent position at the Westminster Assembly. However, in February 1644, five members of the Assembly – known to history as the Five Dissenting Brethren – published a pamphlet entitled \\"An Apologetical Narration, humbly submitted to the Honorable Houses of Parliament, by Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, Sidrach Simpson, Jeremiah Burroughs, & William Bridge.\\" This publication laid out the case for the Independent position forcefully, and made it impossible for the Scottish Commissioners to succeed in quickly creating an amicable consensus around the presbyterian position. Instead, in 1644, the Westminster Assembly became the sight of a series of heated debate between the Presbyterians and the Independents. The Independents were the party most committed to experimental predestinarianism, the position that one can have assurance of election in this life. Experimental predestinarians tended to undergo dramatic conversion experiences. With the rise of experimental predestinarianism, there was a concomitant call among some of the godly for gathered churches. Unlike the Church of England – which theoretically encompassed everybody in England – a gathered church was made up only of those who had undergone a conversion experience. Following the suppression of Separatism in the late Elizabethan period, calls for gathered churches could only be whispered about. However, the social process of separating \\"the godly\\" from the rest of the congregation continued throughout the early seventeenth century. When the Puritans in New England set up their own congregations, in order to be admitted to the church, one had to be examined by the elders of the church, and then make a public profession of faith before the assembled congregation before being admitted to membership. The Independents supported the New England way and argued for its adoption in England. The result would be a situation where not all English people would be members of the church, but only those who had undergone a conversion experience and made a public confession of faith. Under these circumstances, one of the major reasons why the Independents favored congregational polity was that they argued that only other godly members of the congregation could identify who else was elect. The Independents condemned the suppression of the Separatists – why should the state be used to suppress the godly? They accused the Presbyterian party of wanting to continue the barbarous, \\"popish\\" persecutions of the Laudian bishops. For the first time, the Independents began to advocate a theory of religious liberty. Since they saw only a small minority of the community as actually \\"saved\\", they argued that it made no sense to have a uniform national church. Rather, each gathered church should be free to organize itself as it saw fit. They were therefore opposed not only to the Book of Common Prayer, but also to any attempt to reform the liturgy – they argued that in fact there shouldn't be any national liturgy at all, but that each minister and each congregation should be free to worship God in the way they saw fit. \\"The Assertion of Liberty of Conscience By the Independents at the Westminster Assembly of Divines\\" by John Rogers Herbert (1810–1890). The Presbyterians responded that the Independents were engaged in faction. The Presbyterians were Calvinists just like the Independents, but they spoke of predestination in a different way than the Independents. Some argued that England was an elect nation, that divine providence had chosen England as a special called nation, just as he had chosen the Israelites to be a chosen people in the Old Testament. Others argued that, while it is true that God has chosen some as elect and some as reprobate, it is really impossible in this life for any individual to know whether he or she was among the elect, and that life should therefore simply be lived in as close of conformity to the will of God as possible. They certainly did not approve of the Independents who thought that they were the only members of the elect in England: true, many members of the Church of England may have engaged in many open and notorious sins, but for the Presbyterians, that was a sign that the state needed to step in to punish those sins, lest God visit punishments on the nation in the same way that He visited punishments on Old Testament Israel when He found them sinning. The Independent position was clearly in the minority at the Westminster Assembly – there were, after all, only Five Dissenting Brethren in an Assembly of roughly 120 divines – making it impossible for the Independents in the Assembly to get their position passed. =The Erastian Controversy, 1645–46= During the next two years, a second controversy occupied a great deal of time and attention of the Westminster Assembly: the controversy over Erastianism. The issue of the proper relationship of church and state – which was a part of the Independents Controversy – was at the heart of the Erastian Controversy. During the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, two great Acts of Parliament had established the place of the Church of England in English life (1) the Act of Supremacy, which declared the monarch to be the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and which imposed an oath on all subjects requiring them to swear that they recognized the royal supremacy in the church; and (2) the Act of Uniformity, which established religious uniformity throughout the country by requiring all churches to conduct services according to the Book of Common Prayer. The events of the 1640s caused the English legal community to worry that the Westminster Assembly was preparing to illegally alter the church in a way that overrode the Act of Supremacy. As such, John Selden, arguably the foremost jurist in England since the death of Edward Coke in 1634, led a campaign against altering the Church of England in a way that would undermine the Act of Supremacy. Thus, just as the Presbyterian party in the Assembly was dominated by non-members (the Scottish Commissioners), the Erastian party was dominated by Selden and the other lawyers. Selden argued that not only English law, but the Bible itself required that the church be subordinate to the state: he cited the relationship of Zadok to King David and Romans 13 in support of this view. Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605–1675), MP who attended the Westminster Assembly as a lay assessor and who played a crucial role in ensuring that when the Long Parliament adopted presbyterianism for the Church of England, it did so in an Erastian way. Beginning in April 1645, the Assembly shifted its attention from the Independents Controversy to the Erastian Controversy. Besides John Lightfoot, the most zealous proponent of the Erastian position was Bulstrode Whitelocke, one of the MPs serving as a lay assessor to the Assembly. Whitelock maintained that only the state – and not the church – could lawfully exercise the power of excommunication. In October 1645, the Scottish Commissioners got their way when the Long Parliament voted in favour of an ordinance erecting a presbyterian form of church government in England. However, they were appalled that the Parliament also adopted the Erastian argument and made any final decision of the church on the question of excommunication appealable from the General Assembly to the Parliament of England. This decision provoked protests from the Presbyterian party. The Parliament of Scotland, worried that the Long Parliament was failing to live up to its commitments under the Solemn League and Covenant, protested the Erastian nature of the ordinance. The ministers of London organized a petition to the Parliament. The Westminster Assembly responded by sending a delegation, led by Stephen Marshall, a fiery preacher who had delivered several sermons to the Long Parliament, to protest the Erastian nature of the ordinance. (Some MPs argued that the Assembly by this action committed a praemunire and should be punished.) Parliament responded by sending a delegation which included Nathaniel Fiennes to the Westminster Assembly, along with a list of interrogatories related to the jure divino nature of church government. The Assembly responded by flatly rejecting the Erastian position – with John Lightfoot and Thomas Coleman being the lone members speaking in favour of Erastianism. George Gillespie (1613–1648), Scottish Commissioner to the Westminster Assembly who wrote Aaron's Rod Blossoming, one of the most important defenses of Presbyterian polity. The Presbyterian party now initiated a massive public relations campaign and it was during 1646 that many of the major defenses of Presbyterianism were published, beginning with Jus Divinum Regiminis Ecclesiastici ; or, The Divine Right of Church Government Asserted and Evidenced by the Holy Scriptures. By sundry Ministers of Christ within the City of London, published in December 1646. One of the Scottish Commissioners, Samuel Rutherford, published a book entitled The Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication. A second Scottish Commissioner, George Gillespie engaged in a pamphlet debate with Coleman: in response to a sermon which Coleman published advocating the Erastian position, Gillespie published A Brotherly Examination of some Passages of Mr. Coleman’s late printed Sermon; Coleman responded with A Brotherly Examination Re-examined; Gillespie responded with Nihil Respondes; Coleman replied with Male Dicis Maledicis; and Gillespie responded with Male Audis. Gillespie also had words for William Prynne, who had written in favour of the Parliament's ordinance; Prynne was a special target of attack when Gillespie produced his magnum opus, Aaron’s Rod Blossoming; or, The Divine Ordinance of Church Government Vindicated, a work which partially incorporated material from the controversy with Coleman. The Presbyterian party also used their strength in London to petition the Parliament in favour of their position. John Milton (1608–1674), an Independent who wrote a famous poem \\"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\\" denouncing the Long Parliament for not adopting religious liberty in 1645. Although in August 1645, Parliament had passed an ordinance expressing its intent to set up elders throughout the country, it had not actually provided how this should be done. On 14 March 1646, Parliament passed the \\"Ordinance for keeping scandalous persons from the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for the choice of elders, and for supplying defects in former Ordinances concerning church government.\\" This Ordinance provided mechanisms for selecting elders throughout the country, and generally established a Presbyterian system of church governance for the country. However, this Ordinance again contained an Erastian element. The Ordinance created a new office of \\"commissioners to judge of scandalous offenses\\": these commissioners were granted jurisdiction to determine if a \\"scandalous offense\\" warranted excommunication and sessions were forbidden from excommunicating any church member without a commissioner first having signed off on the excommunication. The Presbyterian party was furious at the inclusion of the office of commissioner in the act that created Presbyterian polity in England. The Independent party was angry that Parliament remained in the business of enforcing religious conformity at all. The most famous expression of the Independents' despondency at the Long Parliament's actions was John Milton's poem \\"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\\". Milton argued that the Long Parliament was imitating popish tyranny in the church; violating the biblical principle of Christian liberty; and engaging in a course of action that would punish godly men. He concluded the poem with the famous line, \\"New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large\\" (a play on words since in English, the word \\"Priest\\" emerged as a contraction of the Greek word \\"Presbyter\\", but also claiming that the Presbyters under the Long Parliament's plan would be even worse than the Catholic and Laudian priests whom all Puritans abhorred). =The creation of the Westminster Standards, 1641–1646= At the same time that the Westminster Assembly had been debating ecclesiology, they had also been reviewing worship and doctrine. These aspects generated less controversy amongst the divines. Tasked with reforming the English liturgy, the Assembly first considered simply adopting John Knox's Book of Common Order, but this possibility was rejected by the Assembly in 1644, and the work of drawing up a new liturgy entrusted to a committee. This committee drafted the Directory of Public Worship, which was passed by the Westminster Assembly in 1645. Unlike the Book of Common Prayer, which had contained detailed rubrics regulating in minute detail how clergymen were supposed to conduct service, the Directory of Public Worship is basically a loose agenda for worship, and expected the minister to fill in the details. Under the Directory, the focus of the service was on preaching. The service opened with a reading of a passage from the Bible; followed by an opening prayer (selected or composed by the minister, or offered extemporaneously by the minister); followed by a sermon; and then ended with a closing prayer. The Directory provides guidelines as to what the prayers and sermon ought to contain, but does not contain any set forms of prayers. The Directory encouraged the public singing of psalms, but left it to the minister's discretion which psalms should be used in the service and where in the service (contrast this with the Book of Common Prayer, which set out the precise order for singing psalms for every day of the year in a way that ensured that the entire Book of Psalms is sung once a month). The sections dealing with baptism, communion, marriage, funerals, days of public fasting and days of public thanksgiving all have a similar character. In 1643, the Long Parliament had ordered the Westminster Assembly to draw up a new Confession of Faith and a new national catechism. The result was the production of the Westminster Confession of Faith and two catechisms, the Westminster Larger Catechism (designed to be comprehensive) and the Westminster Shorter Catechism (designed to be easier for children to memorize). The Long Parliament approved the Directory of Public Worship in 1645. The Westminster Confession was presented to Parliament in 1646, but the House of Commons returned the Confession to the Assembly with the instruction that proof texts from Scripture should be added to the Confession. This version was resubmitted to Parliament in 1648, and, after a long a rigorous debate (during the course of which some chapters and sections approved by the Assembly were deleted), the Confession was ratified by the Long Parliament. The Larger Catechism was completed in 1647, and the Shorter Catechism in 1648, and both received the approval of both the Westminster Assembly and the Long Parliament. Since the Westminster Standards had been produced under the watchful eye of the Scottish Commissioners at the Westminster Assembly, the Scottish had no problem ratifying the Westminster Standards in order to keep Scotland's commitment to England under the Solemn League and Covenant. Since the Directory set up a type of ecclesiology already practiced in the Church of Scotland, it was quickly ratified by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and then by the Parliament of Scotland in 1646. The Larger and Shorter Catechisms were ratified by General Assembly in 1648 and the Westminster Confession in 1649. The Westminster Standards are the general standards of the Church of Scotland and of nearly all Presbyterian denominations to this day. Its work being completed, the Westminster Assembly was dissolved in 1649. =Oliver Cromwell and the Independent ascendancy in the New Model Army= In 1646, the Presbyterian party committed themselves to a fateful course of action. As background, we need to briefly consider the course of the First English Civil War. Parliamentary forces had initially fared poorly against royalist forces: the first major battle of the war, the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642, was inconclusive, as was the First Battle of Newbury of 20 September 1643. As noted above, as a result of their failure to defeat the king on the battlefield, in the wake of the First Battle of Newbury, the Long Parliament decided to enter into an alliance with the Scottish, which resulted in the Solemn League and Covenant (by which the Long Parliament agreed to establish presbyterianism in England), and with the war being entrusted to a joint committee of Scottish and English known as the Committee of Both Kingdoms. With the addition of the Scottish forces, the parliamentarians now won a decisive victory at the Battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644. Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658), parliamentary commander who came to favor the Independents, and who brilliantly convinced the Long Parliament to pass the Self-denying Ordinance, as a result of which he was able to ensure that when the New Model Army was organized in 1645, it was dominated by Independents. The most successful parliamentary cavalry commander had been Oliver Cromwell, and Cromwell now approached the Committee of Both Kingdoms with a proposal. Cromwell had come to the conclusion that the current military system was untenable because it relied on local militias defending local areas. Cromwell proposed that Parliament create a new army that would be deployable anywhere in the kingdom and not tied to a particular locality. After the Second Battle of Newbury of 27 October 1644, where parliamentary forces greatly outnumbered royalist forces and yet parliamentary forces were barely able to defeat the royalist forces, Cromwell redoubled his arguments in favor of creating a new army. At this point, most of the leaders in the parliamentary army were Presbyterians who supported the Presbyterians at the Westminster Assembly. Cromwell, however, had also been following the goings-on of the Westminster Assembly and he sided with the Independents. Cromwell thought that the Presbyterians in the army – notably his superior, Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester – opposed his proposal to create a new and more effective army mainly because they wanted to make peace with the king. He also thought that the army's supreme commander, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, shared Manchester's views. Cromwell, however, felt that parliamentary forces should seek total victory over the royalists, and since he distrusted Charles immensely, he felt that Charles should have no role in any post-war government. Cromwell, who was an MP as well as a military commander, now devised a brilliant way to outmaneuver his enemies in the army. In Parliament, Cromwell suddenly proposed a dramatic way to resolve his differences with Manchester and Essex. On 9 December 1644, Cromwell introduced a bill in Parliament saying that no member of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords could retain his position as a military commander while serving as a member of Parliament. Members would have to choose: either resign from Parliament or resign from the army. Cromwell's bill was passed by the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords in January 1645, who were worried that this would mean that no nobleman could serve as a commander in the army. To assuage this worry, Cromwell re-introduced his bill with a provision saying that, if Parliament wished, it could re-appoint any parliamentarian who resigned from the army to the army if it so chose. The Lords were ultimately persuaded by Cromwell, and on 13 January 1645 passed this bill, known to history as the Self-denying Ordinance. At roughly the same time, on 6 January 1645, the Committee of Both Kingdoms finally approved Cromwell's request and authorized the creation of the New Model Army. In the wake of the Self-denying Ordinance, Essex and Manchester both resigned from the army in order to retain their positions in the House of Lords. Cromwell, instead, resigned from the House of Commons rather than forfeit his position in the army. Thus, when the New Model Army was organized under Sir Thomas Fairfax, Cromwell was the most senior army commander left in the army. Fairfax therefore leaned on Cromwell as his number-two during the organization of the New Model Army. Cromwell did everything in his power to ensure that no Presbyterians were recruited to the New Model Army, and that Independents were encouraged to join the New Model Army. Cromwell had thus created a situation where the Presbyterians dominated the Long Parliament, but the Independents dominated the New Model Army. The Soldier's Catechism, which set out the rules and regulations of the New Model Army. At the Battle of Naseby on 16 June 1645, the New Model Army achieved a decisive victory over royalist forces. A number of subsequent battles were needed to finally defeat the royalist forces. In May 1646, Charles surrendered himself over to Scottish forces at Southwell, Nottinghamshire. So, to summarize the situation as we move into 1647: On the one hand, you have the leaders of the Long Parliament and the Scottish favoring peace with Charles and a restoration of Charles to power as a constitutional monarch, while Oliver Cromwell, the Independent leader of the New Model Army, wants to get rid of Charles. On the other hand, you have the Scottish and the Presbyterian party at the Westminster Assembly pushing for a pure form of Presbyterian polity for the Church of England, while the Long Parliament has enacted a form of presbyterianism which contains Erastian elements which the Westminster Presbyterian party and the Scottish find deeply distasteful. Under these circumstances, the Scottish, and the Presbyterian party at the Westminster Assembly (a party which had been dominated by the Scottish Commissioners) decided to approach the king in order to seek his support against the Independents and the Erastians. =The Second English Civil War (1648–49) and the Regicide (1649)= In summer and fall 1647, Henry Ireton and John Lambert negotiated with both houses of parliament and eventually the Army and Parliament reached agreement on a set of proposals, known as the Heads of Proposals, which were presented to Charles in November 1647. The main propositions were * Royalists had to wait five years before running for or holding an office. * The Book of Common Prayer was allowed to be read but not mandatory, and no penalties should be made for not going to church, or attending other acts of worship. * The sitting Parliament was to set a date for its own termination. Thereafter, biennial Parliaments were to be called (i.e. every two years), which would sit for a minimum of 120 days and maximum of 240 days. Constituencies were to be reorganized. * Episcopacy would be retained in church government, but the power of the bishops would be substantially reduced. * Parliament was to control the appointment of state officials and officers in the army and navy for 10 years. Charles, however, rejected the Heads of Proposals. Instead, Charles negotiated with a faction of Scottish Covenanters and on 26 December 1647, signed The Engagement, a secret treaty with the group of Scottish Covenanters who became known as the Engagers. Under the Engagement, Charles agreed that episcopacy should be suppressed in the Church of England, and he agreed to support presbyterianism for three years, after which a permanent solution to the question of the church's polity could be worked out. In exchange, the Engagers agreed to bring an army of 20,000 into England in order to suppress the New Model Army and restore Charles to his throne. This led to the Second English Civil War. The royalist forces were defeated decisively at the Battle of Preston on 17–19 August 1648. Print depicting the trial of Charles I (1600–1649) in 1649. While opposition to putting Charles on trial was strong, the Independents in the New Model Army insisted on a trial, and then an execution, and purged the Long Parliament so that the trial and execution could go ahead. The Independents in the Army now argued that the King was \\"Charles Stuart, that man of blood\\" who deserved to be punished, and that the outcome of the First English Civil War had been proof of God's judgment against Charles. Taking up arms after that judgment had been rendered resulted in the shedding of innocent blood. The leaders of the army therefore drafted The Remonstrance of the Army in November 1648, calling on the Long Parliament to execute Charles and to replace hereditary monarchy in England with an elective monarchy. When the Long Parliament rejected the Army's Remonstrance, the Army Council decided that they would take decisive action. On Wednesday 6 December Colonel Thomas Pride’s Regiment of Foot took up position on the stairs leading to the House. Pride stood at the top of the stairs. As MPs arrived, he checked them against the list provided to him; Lord Grey of Groby helped to identify those to be arrested and those to be prevented from entering. Pride's Purge excluded all but about 200 members of the about the 500 member who had been entitled to sit before the purge. After the Purge, the remaining members (who were sympathetic to the Independent party and the Army Council)—henceforth known as the Rump Parliament—proceeded to do what the Long Parliament had refused to do: put Charles on trial for high treason. The House of Commons passed an act on 3 January 1649 creating a High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I. This Act was rejected by the House of Lords, but the Army insisted that the trial should go ahead anyway. It began on 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall and ended on 27 January 1649 with a guilty verdict. 59 Commissioners signed Charles' death warrant, and he was subsequently beheaded on 30 January 1649. Frontispiece of Eikon Basilike, a book purportedly by King Charles (1600–1649), but likely ghost-written by John Gauden (1605–1662) and which appeared immediately after Charles' execution in January 1649. Eikon Basilike portrayed Charles as a Christian saint who had been martyred for defending episcopacy in the Church of England against Puritan fanatics. The execution of Charles I would be the lens through which the Puritan movement was viewed for generations. For its opponents, the outcome confirmed that Puritanism ultimately led to violent rebellion, and that there was a straight line from religious fanaticism to regicide. The largest single group of Puritans, the Presbyterians, had in fact opposed the regicide, but to the supporters of the king and of episcopacy, this seemed like too fine a distinction. On the other hand, for many Independents, the regicide was entirely justified: Charles was a man who had been a tyrant and who defied the will of God and therefore had to be punished. Literary exchanges over the regicide occurred after royalists published Eikon Basilike immediately upon Charles's execution. Eikon Basilike purported to be written by Charles during his time in captivity, but was almost certainly ghost-written, likely by John Gauden. In this book, Charles is presented as a \\"devout son of the Church of England\\" who was unjustly hounded by Puritan persecutors and ultimately martyred for defending the Church of England against fanatics. John Milton, now the most important Independent polemicist, responded later in 1649 in a book he entitled Eikonoklastes, which was a point-by-point response to Eikon Basilike's flattering portrait of Charles and its unflattering portrait of the Parliamentarians and the Army.

They broke into numerous sects, of which the Presbyterian group comprised most of the clergy, but was deficient in political power since Cromwell's sympathies were with the Independents. During this period the term \\"Puritan\\" becomes largely moot, therefore, in British terms, though the situation in New England was very different. After the English Restoration the Savoy Conference and Uniformity Act 1662 drove most of the Puritan ministers from the Church of England, and the outlines of the Puritan movement changed over a few decades into the collections of Presbyterian and Congregational churches, operating as they could as Dissenters under changing regimes. English Interregnum, 1649–1660  =Failure of the Presbyterian church, 1649–1654 = The English Interregnum was a period of religious diversity in England. With the creation of the Commonwealth of England in 1649, government passed to the English Council of State, a group dominated by Oliver Cromwell, an advocate of religious liberty. In 1650, at Cromwell's behest, the Rump Parliament abolished the Act of Uniformity 1558, meaning that while England now had an officially established church with Presbyterian polity, there was no legal requirement that anyone attend services in the established church. In 1646, the Long Parliament had abolished episcopacy in the Church of England and replaced it with a presbyterian system, and had voted to replace the Book of Common Prayer with the Directory of Public Worship. The actual implementation of these reforms in the church proceeded slowly for a number of reasons: * In many localities - especially those areas which had been Royalist during the Civil Wars and which had low numbers of Puritans, both the bishops and the Book of Common Prayer were popular, and ministers as well as their congregations simply continued to conduct worship in their ordinary way. * Independents opposed the scheme, and started conducting themselves as gathered churches. * Clergymen who favored presbyterianism nevertheless disliked the Long Parliament's ordinance because it included an Erastian element in the office of \\"commissioner\\". Some were thus less than enthusiastic about implementing the Long Parliament's scheme. * Since the office of bishop had been abolished in the church, with no substitute, there was no one to enforce the new presbyterianism scheme on the church, so the combination of opposition and apathy meant that little was done. With the abolition of the Act of Uniformity, even the pretense of religious uniformity broke down. Thus, while the Presbyterians were dominant (at least theoretically) within the established church, those who opposed Presbyterianism were in fact free to start conducting themselves in the way they wanted. Separatists, who had previously organized themselves underground, were able to worship openly. For example, as early as 1616, the first English Baptists had organized themselves in secret, under the leadership of Henry Jacob, John Lothropp, and Henry Jessey. Now, however, they were less secretive. Other ministers - who favored the congregationalist New England Way - also began setting up their own congregations outside of the established church. Many sects were also organized during this time. It is not clear that they should be called \\"Puritan\\" sects since they placed less emphasis on the Bible than is characteristic of Puritans, instead insisting on the role of direct contact with the Holy Spirit. These groups included the Ranters, the Fifth Monarchists, the Seekers, the Muggletonians, and - most prominently and most lastingly - the Quakers. =Religious controversies of the Interregnum= John Owen (1616-1683), whom Cromwell named vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1651 and who was considered by many to be the leader of the Independents in the 1650s. The Puritan movement split over issues of ecclesiology in the course of the Westminster Assembly. In the course of the 1650s, the movement became further split in the course of a number of controversies. With no means to enforce uniformity in the church and with freedom of the press, these disputes were largely played out in pamphlet warfare throughout the decade. Owen—Baxter Debate over the nature of Justification In 1647, John Owen, the pastor of Coggeshall, Essex, a man who was a champion of congregationalism, who had preached to the Long Parliament, and who had published a number of works denouncing Arminianism, published his work The Death of Death in the Death of Christ. In this work, he denounced the Arminian doctrine of the unlimited atonement and argued in favour of the doctrine of a limited atonement. He also denounced the spread of Amyraldism in England, a position most associated with John Davenant, Samuel Ward and their followers. In 1649, Richard Baxter, the minister of Kidderminster, Worcestershire and who served as chaplain to Colonel Edward Whalley's regiment, published a reply to Owen, entitled Aphorisms of Justification. He argued that the doctrine of unlimited atonement was more faithful to the words of scripture. He invoked the authority of dozens of the Reformers, including John Calvin, in support of his position. Richard Baxter (1615-1691), the minister of Kidderminster whom Dean Stanley called \\"the Chief of English Protestant Schoolmen.\\" In the course of the 1650s, he came to be seen as the leader of the Presbyterians, the largest Puritan faction. In the course of the 1650s, Owen and Baxter engaged in a series of replies and counter-replies on the topic. At the same time, both men gained followers for their positions. John Owen preached to the Long Parliament the day after the execution of Charles I, and then accompanied Oliver Cromwell to Ireland. Cromwell charged Owen with reforming Trinity College, Dublin. In 1651, after the Presbyterian Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Edward Reynolds, refused to take the Engagement, Cromwell appointed Owen as vice-chancellor in his stead. From that post, Owen became the most prominent Independent churchman of the 1650s. Baxter also gained a following in the 1650s, publishing prolifically after his return to Kidderminster. Two of his books - The Saints' Everlasting Rest (1650) and The Reformed Pastor (1656) - have been regarded by subsequent generations as Puritan classics. Many clergymen came to see Baxter as the leader of the Presbyterians, the largest party of Puritans, in the course of the 1650s. Socinian controversy Socinianism, an anti- trinitarian position, had made a few in-roads into England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Adherents of this position had been brutally oppressed, with a number of high-profile executions, including that of Francis Kett in 1589, and Bartholomew Legate and Edward Wightman in 1612, after they in 1609 published a Latin version of the Racovian Catechism. The most prominent Socinian of the 1650s was John Biddle, often known as the \\"Father of English Unitarianism.\\" Biddle was imprisoned in 1645 and 1646 for publicizing his denials of the Trinity. After being defended in the Long Parliament by Henry Vane the Younger, Biddle was released in 1648. In 1652, he was arrested again after he published an anti-trinitarian catechism. John Owen produced several pieces denouncing Biddle's views. However, Cromwell, true to his principle of religious liberty, intervened to ensure that Biddle was not executed, but instead sent to exile on the Isles of Scilly in 1652. Growth of the sectaries From 1660 to present day =Puritans and the Restoration, 1660= The largest Puritan faction - the Presbyterians - had been deeply dissatisfied with the state of the church under Cromwell. They wanted to restore religious uniformity throughout England and they believed that only a restoration of the English monarchy could achieve this and suppress the sectaries. Most Presbyterians were therefore supportive of the Restoration of Charles II. Charles II's most loyal followers - those who had followed him into exile on the continent, like Sir Edward Hyde - had fought the English Civil War largely in defense of episcopacy and insisted that episcopacy be restored in the Church of England. Nevertheless, in the Declaration of Breda, issued in April 1660, a month before Charles II's return to England, Charles II proclaimed that while he intended to restore the Church of England, he would also pursue a policy of religious toleration for non- adherents of the Church of England. Charles II named the only living pre-Civil War bishop William Juxon as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1660, but it was widely understood that because of Juxon's age, he would likely die soon and be replaced by Gilbert Sheldon, who, for the time being, became Bishop of London. In a show of goodwill, one of the chief Presbyterians, Edward Reynolds, was named Bishop of Norwich and chaplain to the king. Shortly after Charles II's return to England, in early 1661, Fifth Monarchists Vavasor Powell and Thomas Venner attempted a coup against Charles II. Thus, elections were held for the Cavalier Parliament in a heated atmosphere of anxiety about a further Puritan uprising. Nevertheless, Charles II had hoped that the Book of Common Prayer could be reformed in a way that was acceptable to the majority of the Presbyterians, so that when religious uniformity was restored by law, the largest number of Puritans possible could be incorporated inside the Church of England. At the April 1661 Savoy Conference, held at Gilbert Sheldon's chambers at Savoy Hospital, twelve bishops and twelve representatives of the Presbyterian party (Edward Reynolds, Anthony Tuckney, John Conant, William Spurstowe, John Wallis, Thomas Manton, Edmund Calamy, Richard Baxter, Arthur Jackson, Thomas Case, Samuel Clarke, and Matthew Newcomen) met to discuss Presbyterian proposals for reforming the Book of Common Prayer drawn up by Richard Baxter. Baxter's proposed liturgy was largely rejected at the Conference. When the Cavalier Parliament met in May 1661, its first action, largely a reaction to the Fifth Monarchist uprising, was to pass the Corporation Act of 1661, which barred anyone who had not received communion in the Church of England in the past twelve months from holding office in a city or corporation. It also required officeholders to swear the Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Supremacy, to swear belief in the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and to renounce the Covenant. =The Great Ejection, 1662= Title page of a collection of Farewell Sermons preached by ministers ejected from their parishes in 1662. In 1662, the Cavalier Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity of 1662, restoring the Book of Common Prayer as the official liturgy. The Act of Uniformity prescribed that any minister who refused to conform to the Book of Common Prayer by St. Bartholomew's Day 1662 would be ejected from the Church of England. This date became known as Black Bartholomew's Day, among dissenters, a reference to the fact that it occurred on the same day as the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572. The majority of ministers who had served in Cromwell's state church conformed to the Book of Common Prayer. Members of Cromwell's state church who chose to conform in 1662 were often labeled Latitudinarians by contemporaries - this group includes John Tillotson, Simon Patrick, Thomas Tenison, William Lloyd, Joseph Glanvill, and Edward Fowler. The Latitudinarians formed the basis of what would later become the Low church wing of the Church of England. The Puritan movement had become particularly fractured in the course of the 1640s and 1650s, and with the decision of the Latitudinarians to conform in 1662, it became even further fractured. Around two thousand Puritan ministers resigned from their positions as Church of England clergy as a consequence. This group included Richard Baxter, Edmund Calamy the Elder, Simeon Ashe, Thomas Case, William Jenkyn, Thomas Manton, William Sclater, and Thomas Watson. After 1662, the term \\"Puritan\\" was generally supplanted by \\"Nonconformist\\" or \\"Dissenter\\" to describe those Puritans who had refused to conform in 1662. =Persecution of Dissenters, 1662-72= Though expelled from their pulpits in 1662, many of the non-conforming ministers continued to preach to their followers in public homes and other locations. These private meetings were known as conventicles. The congregations that they formed around the non-conforming ministers at this time form the nucleus for the later English Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist denominations. The Cavalier Parliament responded hostilely to the continued influence of the non-conforming ministers. In 1664, it passed the Conventicle Act banning religious assemblies of more than five people outside of the Church of England. In 1665, it passed the Five Mile Act, forbidding ejected ministers from living within five miles of a parish from which they had been banned, unless they swore an oath never to resist the king, or attempt to alter the government of Church or State. Under the penal laws forbidding religious dissent (generally known to history as the Clarendon Code), many ministers were imprisoned in the latter half of the 1660s. One of the most notable victims of the penal laws during this period (though he was not himself an ejected minister) was John Bunyan, a Baptist, who was imprisoned from 1660 to 1672. At the same time that the Cavalier Parliament was ratcheting up the legal penalties against religious dissent, there were various attempts from the side of government and bishops, to establish a basis for \\"comprehension\\", a set of circumstances under which some dissenting ministers could return to the Church of England. These schemes for comprehension would have driven a wedge between Presbyterians and the group of Independents; but the discussions that took place between Latitudinarian figures in the Church and leaders such as Baxter and Manton never bridged the gap between Dissenters and the \\"high church\\" party in the Church of England, and comprehension ultimately proved impossible to achieve. =The Road to Religious Toleration for the Dissenters, 1672-89= In 1670, Charles II had signed the Secret Treaty of Dover with Louis XIV of France. In this treaty he committed to securing religious toleration for the Roman Catholic recusants in England. In March 1672, Charles issued his Royal Declaration of Indulgence, which suspended the penal laws against the dissenters and eased restrictions on the private practice of Catholicism. Many imprisoned dissenters (including John Bunyan) were released from prison in response to the Royal Declaration of Indulgence. The Cavalier Parliament reacted hostilely to the Royal Declaration of Indulgence. Supporters of the high church party in the Church of England resented the easing of the penal laws, while many across the political nation suspected that Charles II was plotting to restore Catholicism to England. The Cavalier Parliament's hostility forced Charles to withdraw the declaration of indulgence, and the penal laws were again enforceable. In 1673, Parliament passed the first Test Act, requiring all officeholders in England to abjure the doctrine of transubstantiation (thus ensuring that no Catholics could hold office in England). =Later trends= Puritan experience underlay the later Latitudinarian and Evangelical trends in the Church of England. Divisions between Presbyterian and Congregationalist groups in London became clear in the 1690s, and with the Congregationalists following the trend of the older Independents, a split became perpetuated. The Salters' Hall conference of 1719 was a landmark, after which many of the congregations went their own way in theology. In Europe, in the 17th and 18th centuries, a movement within Lutheranism parallel to puritan ideology (which was mostly of a Calvinist orientation) became a strong religious force known as pietism. In the United States, the Puritan settlement of New England was a major influence on American Protestantism. With the start of the English Civil War in 1642, fewer settlers to New England were Puritans. The period of 1642 to 1659 represented a period of peaceful dominance in English life by the formerly discriminated Puritan population. Consequently, most felt no need to settle in the American colonies. Very few immigrants to the Colony of Virginia and other early colonies, in any case, were Puritans. Virginia was a repository for more middle class and \\"royalist\\" oriented settlers, who were leaving England following their loss of power during the English Commonwealth. Many migrants to New England who had looked for greater religious freedom found the Puritan theocracy to be repressive, examples being Roger Williams, Stephen Bachiler, Anne Hutchinson, and Mary Dyer. Puritan populations in New England, continued to grow, with many large and prosperous Puritan families. (See Estimated Population 1620–1780: Immigration to the United States.)

Prophetic medical traditions exhort humans simply not to stop at following Muhammad's teachings, but encourage them to search for cures as well. The literature of prophetic medicine thus occupies a symbolic role in the elucidation of Islamic identity as constituted by a particular set of relationships to science, medicine, technology and nature. There has historically been a tension in the understanding of the medical narratives: are they of the same nature as Muhammad’s religious pronouncements, or are they time-sensitive, culturally situated, and thus not representative of a set of eternal medical truths. This body of knowledge was fully articulated only in the 14th century, at which point it was concerned with reconciling Sunnah (traditions) with the foundations of the Galenic humoral theory that was prevalent at the time in the medical institutions of the Islamicate world. It is nonetheless a tradition with continued modern-day currency. Overview Prophetic medicine is sometimes casually identified with Unani medicine or traditional medicine, although it is distinguished from some iterations of these and from scientific medicine most predominantly by the former being specifically a collection of advice attributed to Muhammad in the Islamic tradition. One would do well to note that medieval interpretations of the medical hadith were produced in a Galenic medical context, while modern-day editions might bring in recent research findings to frame the importance of the genre. In the hadith, Muhammad recommended the use of honey and hijama (wet cupping) for healing and had generally opposed the use of cauterization for causing \\"pain and menace to a patient\\". Other items with beneficial effects attributed to Muhammad, and standard features on traditional medicine in the Islamicate world, include olive oil; dates; miswak as a necessity for oral health and Nigella sativa or \\"black seed\\" or \\"black cumin\\" and its oils. These items are still sold in Islamic centers or sellers of other Islamic goods. Muhammad's firm belief in the existence of a cause and a cure for every disease is described in many hadith along the lines of the below: This belief can be said to be a grounding philosophy of this otherwise loosely defined field,Irmeli Pehro, The Prophet's Medicine: A Creation of the Muslim Traditionalist Scholars (Helsinki: Kokemaki, 1995) and is said to have encouraged early Muslims to engage in medical research and seek out cures for diseases known to them. Recommendations =Black seeds= Nigella sativa seeds Abu Hurayra quoted Muhammad saying: \\"Utilize the black seed for without a doubt, it is a cure for all sicknesses aside from death.\\" (Hadith Al-Bukhari 7:591) =Camel urine= Some people of\` Ukl or \`Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not suit them. So the Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they went as directed and after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away all the camels. (Hadith Al-Bukhari 4:100) =Honey= The value of honey is traced to specific mention of its virtues in the Quran, an-Nahl (the Bees) and not just Muhammad. (Quran 68-69) Works While the prominent works focused on treatment of the hadith related to health date from several centuries A.H., Sahih al-Bukhari and other earlier collections included these as well. 'Abd Allah b. Bustâm al-Nîsâbûrî’s Tlbb al-a'imma, aggregating a legacy of several Shi’ite Imams, is widely considered to be the first known treatise on prophetic medicine, although it is rooted in a somewhat different cosmology. The canonical al-Bukhari corpus, divided into 97 books with 3,450 chapters, includes over a 100 traditions in its book, 76 loosely related to medicine, covering topics ranging from precautions against leprosy and epidemics to the forbidding of alcohol and suicide. The most notable works that still survive are attributed to religious scholars and largely not to Galenic physicians, although the latter are occasionally referenced. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya in the 1300s produced one of the most influential works about prophetic medicine in his 277-chapter book, Al-Tibb al-Nabawiyy. Al-Jawziyya deals with a diversity of treatments as recommended by Muhammad but also engages with ethical concerns, discussing malpractice and the hallmarks of the competent doctor.Cyril Elgood (1962) The Medicine Of the Prophet. PubMed Central, 146-153. Ethics of medical practice continue to be an important marker of Islamic medicine for some. Al-Jawziyya also elaborates on the relationship between medicine and religion. A theologian renowned for his exegetical endeavors, Al-Suyuti also composed two works on prophetic medicine, one of which was on sexual relations as ordered by Muhammad. Al-Suyuti's other manuscript divides medicine into three types: traditional, spiritual and preventive (e.g. dietary regimen and exercise). Along with Al-Jawziyya, Al- Suyuti also included commentary that spoke to dealing with contagion and thus was relevant to the Black Death in the Islamic world. Ibn al-Khatib also addressed the Black Death and his belief in the contradiction between hadith and science regarding plagues, which may have led to his execution by strangulation for \\"heresy\\". Both of the works above also address bioethical issues of abortion and conception, issues that, like the idea of Islamic medical heritage as being holistic, continue to be important in constructions of modern Islamic identity.Fazlur Rahman Health and Medicine in the Islamic Tradition: Change and Identity. (New York : Crossroad, 1987) Other notable works include those of Ibn Tulun (d. AD 1546) and Al-Dhahabi (d. AD 1348).  Iran post-1970s  Some clerics in Iran promote a controversial form of prophetic or \\"Islamic\\" medicine, based on sometimes rather unlikely quotations attributed to historic Muslim religious figures, and on Iranian traditional medicine. Abbas Tabrizian, a prominent proponent, has faced official action for selling unapproved treatments; he has been widely criticized, and it thought to have few supporters. His burning of a copy of \\"Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine\\", a medical reference book, was condemned by Grand Ayatollah Jafar Sobhani, who said that \\"insulting medical learning is against the spirit of Islam and Islam’s call for [learning] science... Criticizing the content [of a book] is appropriate, but [burning] is an act of ignorance, and many libraries were set on fire based on wrong motivations in the past\\". Ayatollah Alireza Arafi, who runs Irans seminaries, also condemned the book-burning. Abbas Tabrizian was widely ridiculed for a suggestion that COVID-19 could be prevented by applying a cotton ball soaked in violet oil to the anus. The IRNA news agency reported that Abbas Tabrizian, who has often promoted his remedies as \\"Islamic medicine\\" in opposition to standard medicine, has also claimed that COVID-19 is God's revenge against those who had bothered him. An arrest warrant has been issued for Morteza Kohansal, a follower of Abbas Tabrizian who visited the coronavirus section of a hospital in Iran without wearing protective gear, and applied an unknown substance he described as \\"Prophet's Perfume\\" to patients. Using \\"Islamic medicine\\" has caused some Iranian clerics to delay getting standard medical treatment. Ayatollah Hashem Bathaie Golpayegani announced that he had been infected by COVID-19, but had cured himself, three weeks before being hospitalized. He died two days later. Ayatollah Haeri-Shirazi and Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi were both also said by their families to have long delayed seeking standard medical, using \\"Islamic medicine\\" instead. Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi, who had been considered a possible successor Supreme Leader of Iran, died of cancer. His son Ala Shahroudi later said that \\"The so-called Islamic doctors had convinced my father to ignore what modern physicians said about his illness and how to treat it... My father underwent surgery in 2017. Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, secretly visited and advised him to ignore what the Islamic doctors say, and listen to the modern-day physicians... Nevertheless, my father ignored the leader's recommendation, and continued to trust the so-called Islamic Medicine experts.\\" See also * Challenge of the Quran * Commission on Scientific Signs in the Quran and Sunnah * I'jaz * Iranian traditional medicine * Islamic attitudes towards science * Islamic views on evolution * Islamic view of miracles * Medical Encyclopedia of Islam and Iran * Medicine in the medieval Islamic world * Miracles of Muhammad * Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi * Quran and miracles * Traditional Chinese medicine References Further reading * Ghaly, Mohammed, Prophetic Medicine, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God (2 vols.), Edited by C.

History ICS Courier van *The company's origins can be traced back to 1957 to a small trucking service based in Cabano, Quebec. It was incorporated in 1985, known as Cabano until 1992 when it acquired Kingsway and was renamed Cabano-Kingsway Inc. *In 1999 it changed its name to TFI International *In February 2000 TST Solutions is purchased, this includes TST Overland Express *From 2002-2008 it was an income trust fund called TransForce Income Fund (traded under the symbol TIF on the TSX). *Since 1992 35 companies have been acquired. *Canpar Courier, a non-expedited parcel-delivery company based in Brampton, Ont., was purchased by Transforce (now known as TFI International) in 2002 and is a key member of the parcel delivery segment. Canpar Courier, first established in 1976 as a separate division of Canadian Pacific Trucks, had revenues of approximately $140 million in 2001. The company, which maintains 53 terminals across Canada, operates more than 1,000 vehicles. It also provides transborder services through interline agreements with third party regional and national carriers. *In January 2004 TFI International acquired substantially all assets of Canadian Freightways for CDN $69.6 million plus assumption of loans and credit facilities of CDN $15 million from Consolidated Freightways, which unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy in 2002. Canadian Freightways has a staff of 1,500 employees. The company's operations include LTL, truckload, sufferance warehouses, customs brokerage, international freight forwarding, and logistics management. Combined revenues reported for the last fiscal year were CDN $236 million. *On October 31, 2007 TFI International acquired Century II Holdings Inc., whose wholly owned subsidiary Information Communication Services (ICS Courier) operates a fixed route courier business servicing in excess of 35,000 accounts in the insurance, optical, financial, travel, dental and legal business sectors across Canada. Established in 1978, ICS Courier is headquartered in Toronto and employs a workforce of more than 1,300 employees and owner-operators through a network of 35 offices. In 2006, ICS Courier generated approximately $90 million in revenues. *On November 19, 2009 TFI International closed its acquisition of the Retail Solutions Division of ATS Andlauer Transportation Services Limited Partnership (ATS). The acquired Division generates approximately $120 million in annual revenue. It relies on 165 owner operators for the bulk of its business and employs a total of 447 employees. On January 1, 2014 ATS Retail Solutions was rebranded to TForce Integrated Solutions. *On August 17, 2010 TFI International acquired an equity interest in Calgary's EnQuest Energy Services and its subsidiaries, including Speedy Heavy Hauling. IFI International's U.S. subsidiary, Hemphill Trucking, will pay US$32 million for the assets, which will be merged with Hemphill under the new name of Hemphill-Speedy, headquartered in Grand Junction, Colo. The deal is initially for 19 percent equity in EnQuest with an option to acquire the remaining 81 percent in the next three years. EnQuest provides energy services, primarily in the U.S., such as goods transport, rig-moving, crane services, specialized heavy hauling, oilfield equipment rentals, retailing of new and refurbished oil country tubular goods, and pipe storage. In June, 2012 Kos Oilfield Transportation and Howard's Transport (both TFI International companies) combined to form TForce Energy Services, Inc. The re-organization also brought Hemphill Speedy in the USA and IE Miller into TForce Energy Services. *December 2010 attempts to enter the US market by offering to take over Canada/US logistics, Dallas based business Dynamex (nasdaq:DDMX) which had revenues of $418 million in the year leading up October 31, 2010. The offer was $248 million about the same as its market value. TFI International completed the takeover of Dynamex in February 2011. *On June 27, 2011, TFI International acquired the Canadian assets of DHL, and will be operating it domestically as Loomis Express. It will remain allied with DHL for international shipping. *In August 2011 TFI International acquired Toronto- based cross-border LTL and Truckload company Concord Transportation Inc. for $10 million which includes $2 million in company shares. Concord Transport has annual revenues of $35 million, 96 employees and offices in Illinois, California and Washington in addition to Western Canada. *On November 30, 2011, TFI International took over IE Miller Services. The company operates eight terminals in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Colorado. IE Miller, formerly a subsidiary of Complete Production Services was founded in 1936 and has a workforce numbering approximately 400. *In December 2011 TFI International acquired Pedersen Transport. Pedersen Transport was a family owned and operated LTL and TL company which has been serving southern Alberta since 1966. * Normandin Transit (LTL/Truckload), Brasseur Transport (US/Canada liquid bulk transport), Timeline Logistic (oil/gas, forestry). were all acquired in 2018. * In September 2020, it acquires DLS from U.S. company, R. R. Donnelley & Sons for $225 millions UShttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-quebec-trucking-company- tfi-buys-us-company-dls-for-us225-million/. Business segments and divisions Part of the company's strategy has been to give subsidiaries (most were at one time independent companies) a certain level of autonomy. That allows each subsidiary to continue to cater to different regional markets, giving the parent company access to more markets. TFI International then uses its influence and cash flow to help increase the capacity of each subsidiary (like it did in 2010 when its purchase of a 52-door cross dock terminal in Calgary tripled the capacity of TST Overland and expanded its shipping network). For the 2010 year, overall revenue increased slightly (8.4%) but LTL revenue decreased 5.9% (because of lower prices and the stronger Canadian dollar); the company's takeover of ATS Retail Solutions together with an agreement signed by Canpar with the Ontario government, improved results for the package-courier business. In 2011 TFI International's adjusted profit (excludes the effects of derivatives and foreign exchange rates) was $102.5 million (up 43%) on revenue of $2,690.53 million (up 34%, for the 4q revenue up 46%, profit up 63%). Newly acquired Dynamex and Loomis Express contributed revenues of $202 million for TFI International in 2011. They accounted for virtually all of the change in fourth quarter sales and $608 million of the $688 million increase over the year. *Package and Courier (6 divisions) - TForce Integrated Solutions (ATS Retail Solutions), Canpar Courier, ICS Courier, Dynamex, Loomis Express, All Canadian Courier. *Container transport (2 divisions)Clarke Road Transport‚ JAF 2000 Transport. *Less-Than-Truckload (10 divisions) - Canadian Freightways,Clarke Transport‚ Click Express, Concord, Kingsway, La Crete Transport, Pedersen Transport, Quik X Transportation, TST Overland Express‚ Vitran Express Canada, Cavalier Transport(Bolton,ON). *Truckload (26 divisions) - A&M; International, Bergeron, Besner, CF Dedicated Services, Couture, Durocher International, Ganeca, GHL Transport, Golden International, Grégoire, Highland, Highland Intermodal, J.C.

Along with Streatham and Mitcham R.L.F.C., the club was an early attempt to establish rugby league in London during the 1930s. History Prior to the Acton and Willesden / Streatham and Mitcham rugby league teams, rugby league had been played at the White City Stadium when Wigan Highfield relocated to London and played as London Highfield in 1933. Although the club drew good crowds the operating costs proved too much of a burden so the club moved to Liverpool and became Liverpool Stanley RLFC. Both Acton and Willesden RLFC and Streatham and Mitcham RLFC were started by local businessman Sydney Parkes. The idea of two teams was to generate plenty of interest in the game, and also to attempt to establish greyhound racing at both clubs' newly built grounds. Both teams were accepted into the Rugby Football League in March 1935, in time for the 1935–36 season. A number of supporters and rejected trialists formed a number of amateur teams in London. There was no amateur competition in London at that time but leading teams were Acton Hornets, Park Royal Rangers, Hendon, Dagenham, and Harlesden All Blacks. Unfortunately for Acton and Willesden, high player payments proved to be their downfall. Although they drew good crowds and were reasonably successful, the income was not sufficient to sustain the salaries for the 'reserve standard players' they had recruited. Sydney Parkes moved the Acton and Willesden club from Park Royal to Streatham and Mitcham's Mitcham Stadium in December 1935 to help bolster attendances, however after the supporters association protested matches were eventually returned to Park Royal. Acton and Willesden struggled on but the club folded at the conclusion of the 1935-36 season. Streatham and Mitcham survived a season longer; however, as they were operated the same as Acton and Willesden, insufficient income became a crux and the club folded at the end of March 1937. None of the amateur clubs survived the failure of the two professional clubs. Rugby league would eventually be played again in London, although the establishment of another professional club was not until 1980 in the form of Fulham RLFC at Craven Cottage.

The building’s shape evokes the dynamism of a flower's petals. The building's external structure comprises a series of curved inclined walls made of concrete with a blue back painted glass panels cladding. Those structures protect the building's interior functions from Nur-Sultan’s harsh weather conditions. The building features a thirty-meter-high foyer which extends over 3.000 square meters, which is intended to create an urban-scale internal public square that could welcome the citizens of Nur-Sultan throughout the entire year. The building contains three different music halls. It also encloses restaurants, shops, and bars. The main Concert hall for 3,500 seats is one of the biggest of its kind and is capable of hosting a multitude of different events, from classical to pop music, ballet and conferences thanks to its acoustic flexibility. This flexibility is produced by a system of acoustic curtains and a special false ceiling design called a black-hole, which absorbs most of the acoustic reflections of the hall. The two smaller halls, of 400 and 200 seats respectively, have been designed to be flexible enough to host chamber music as well as cinema and conferences.

It starred Lindsay Duncan, Simon Godley, Lloyd Owen and Lesley Vickerage. It was made by Tandem Television and Carlton Television (developed in association with Red Rooster Film & Television Entertainment) for the ITV network. Plot Louise (Duncan), Adam (Owen), Lestor (Godley) and Francine (Vickerage) are four Londoners in their late 20s or early 30s (although Duncan was 48 at the time of filming), all living in Ladbroke Grove. They are constantly meeting up in each other's flats or in a nearby coffee bar to drink and discuss life, love and sex (possibly due to some of the subject matter being dealt with, the series was broadcast in a post-News at Ten slot). Adam was the smart, cool one; Louise his glamorous friend and landlady; Lestor, his nerdish best friend; and Francine his latest girlfriend, a newcomer to the bunch who - lacking confidence with new people - was finding it hard to fit in. Furthermore, Adam and Louise had enjoyed a brief fling in the past and there was still an attraction between them. Due to the status of the characters as young, metropolitan singles, as well as the nature of the characters themselves and the contemporary urban setting in which they are set, the show could be seen as an attempt to be a British equivalent to the more famous American sitcoms from around the same time that followed this trend, such as Friends or Seinfeld. Unfortunately, one of the reasons that it was not deemed a big success was that many television critics who watched it could not help comparing them with the like of Friends, Frasier or Seinfeld, particularly in the first few episodes. They condemned it as a poor attempt to imitate that type of American sitcom, and hence ITV cancelled it after its only series of seven episodes.

It is with the Berlin–Lehrte railway and the Hanover–Berlin high-speed line one of the most important east-west lines between Hanover and Berlin. Important intermediate stations are Königslutter, Helmstedt and Eilsleben. It is now used mainly for east-west freight traffic, as well as Intercity and Regionalbahn trains. History Old Brunswick station, closed in 1960 Brunswick (German: Braunschweig) and Magdeburg had already been connected with a railway line via Wolfenbüttel, Jerxheim and Oschersleben in 1843. This line took a southerly route, taking advantage of easy terrain. In Wolfenbüttel it connected with the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg line and in Oschersleben it connected with the Magdeburg–Halberstadt line. This connected the lines of the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway and Magdeburg-Halberstädt Railway Company (German: Magdeburg- Halberstädter Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, MHE). This was followed in 1844 by the Hanover–Brunswick railway and in 1846 by the Magdeburg–Potsdam line. In 1845 the Old Brunswick station was opened as a terminus. As traffic increased, the MHE sought from the early 1860s to build a direct Berlin-Hanover line. This was initially rejected by the governments of the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Brunswick. After Hanover lost the war of 1866, and were annexed by Prussia, the MHE set about building its Berlin-Lehrte line via Stendal. This route bypassed the cities of Magdeburg and Brunswick and threatened the importance of the line of the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway Company (German: Berlin- Potsdam-Magdeburger Eisenbahngesellschaft, BPME), especially since it connected in the west only to the network of its rival, the MHE. =Construction and opening = The BPME considered several options for a dedicated connection between its main line and the former Duchy of Brunswick State Railway network, which had been privatised and was now the Brunswick Railway Company (Braunschweigische Eisenbahngesellschaft). While it was clear that its eastern end would be in Magdeburg, in the west several variants were discussed. Brunswick was an important destination and connected well to the west, but had an unfavourable terminal station. It was decided to build a line from Magdeburg to Eilsleben, where it would branch to Helmstedt and Schöningen. From Helmstedt the Brunswick Railway Company would continue the line to Brunswick, while in Schöningen there had been since 1868 a connection to Jerxheim, which had a link to Börßum and the Brunswick Southern Railway to Kreiensen. It there connected with Göttingen and Kassel via the Hanoverian Southern Railway and via Altenbeken to the Ruhr district via the Altenbeken–Kreiensen railway. This gave the new line the same connections to the west as the MHE’s main line. Between Eilsleben and Brunswick the line crosses the Lappwald ridge and the Elm hills. The line is winding and passes over embankments and through cuttings. The line was opened on 15 September 1872. =Development up to World War II = Train between Helmstedt and Marienborn in April 1990 British and Russian soldiers at the former border station of Marienborn in April 1990 While the Berlin–Lehrte line, opened a year earlier, remained the fastest line for passenger between Hanover and Berlin, the line via Helmstedt also carried passenger traffic between the two cities and traffic from Hanover to Halle and Leipzig. In addition, substantial freight traffic was carried on both branches. In 1937 five express trains ran each day each way on the line. =Transit route= Since the line passed through relatively undemanding terrain and has no large structures, it was only impassable for a few days during and after World War II. The allies decided to use this line exclusively for the military transport of the Western powers in Berlin. The Berlin–Lehrte line remained usable, but was used less. In 1960, the current Brunswick Hauptbahnhof opened, which removed the need for trains between Magdeburg and Hanover to reverse. Rail transport between Helmstedt and Eilsleben was reopened under the Transit Agreement of 1972. In the 1980s, there were negotiations between West Germany and East Germany over an expansion of the transit routes. East Germany preferred the Lehrte line, to keep transit traffic out of Potsdam and Magdeburg. In the West, however, there were discussions of improved connections with Brunswick. =German Unity Transport Project= After the fall of the wall it was quickly decided to build a high-speed line between Hanover and Berlin. However, it was also clear that the construction would take several years. The initial experience with speed lines also showed that a separation of freight and high speed passenger traffic made sense. Under the German Unity Transport Projects, it was decided to restore as quickly as possible the existing routes and to electrify lines that were intended primarily for freight later. The core of this plan was the Helmstedt–Magdeburg line. In 1993 it was upgraded for operations at 160 km/h and electrified. In the east it connected with the Biederitz–Dessau line, which in turn connected at Güterglück with a now closed section of the former Canon railway, leading to Berlin. The direct line to Berlin via Brandenburg (Havel) and Potsdam was electrified in 1995. In 1991 the first diesel-powered Intercity train ran from Hanover via Brunswick and Magdeburg to Berlin. Two years later the first Intercity-Express (ICE) ran on the line. The major change came in 1998 when the Hanover–Berlin high-speed line opened. Since then, the hourly ICE trains between Frankfurt and Berlin run on the line only on the 5 km section between Brunswick and the junction with the Weddel loop. Operations in 2017 Intercity passenger trains on the line Leipzig- Magdeburg-Hanover-Cologne/Oldenburg serve the line approximately hourly, provided by the IC 55 Dresden – Leipzig – Magdeburg – Hannover – Dortmund – Cologne and the IC 56 Leipzig – Magdeburg – Hannover – Bremen – Oldenburg, each running every two hours. In addition, there is a Regionalbahn services (the RB 40) that runs every hour on weekdays between Helmstedt and Magdeburg. The line is heavily used for freight. It is part of an electrified corridor connecting the Czech Republic and the industrial regions of Saxony and Saxony- Anhalt with the German and Dutch seaports on the North Sea.

Life Born in Toulouse, Brunet attended the University of Toulouse, where he earned his PhD in 1965. He was subsequently professor at the University of Reims from 1966 to 1976, where he founded IATEUR. He was director of research at CNRS from 1976 to 1981, and from 1981 to 1984 served advisory and research roles in various French government ministries. In 1984, he founded the public interest group RECLUS, which he headed until 1991. Work In the early 1970s, Brunet emerged as a leader in a movement to give academic geography a bigger role in practical issues, such as urban planning policies and secondary-school geography curricula, and founded the journal L'Espace géographique in 1972. He was particularly associated with the development of the chorem, a cartographic approach to representing complex geographic information (including human geography) using a simplified set of spatial primitives. Chorems gained significant adoption in geography education, but also drew critics for allegedly oversimplifying and focusing too strongly on spatial representation. This cartographic approach to geography was, from the early 1980s, a rival to Yves Lacoste's geopolitical approach.

The nursing profession is not new to Islam. Islamic traditions include sympathy for and responsibility toward those in need. This perspective had emerged during the development of Islam as a religion, culture, and civilization. Ethos of health care service In Islamic traditions, caring is the manifestation of love for Allah and Muhammad. Caring in Islam, however, is more than the act of empathy; instead, it consists of being responsible for, sensitive to, and concerned with those in need, namely the weak, the suffering and the outcasts of society. This act of caring is further divided into three principles: intention, thought, and action. Intention and thought refer to who, what, where, when and why to care, whereas action is related to the knowledge necessary to be able to care. In short, health care is deemed as service to the patients and to Allah, as opposed to other professions that are commercial-based. This ethos was the fundamental motivating factor for the majority of the doctors and nurses in the history of Islam. Approach to health care service Another aspect of Islamic health care service that distinguishes it from the contemporary Western health care industry is the holistic approach to health and wellbeing taken. This holistic approach consists of both treating the organic basis of the ailments and providing spiritual support for the patient. This spiritual component comes in the form of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah), a dimension lacking in current Western models of nursing and, thus, could pose as a challenge for application of this model of nursing to Muslim patients as it does not meet their holistic needs. First Muslim nurse The first professional nurse in the history of Islam is a woman named Rufaidah bint Sa’ad, also known as Rufaida Al-Aslamia or Rufayda al-Aslamiyyah, who was born in 620 (est.) and lived at the time of Muhammed.\\"Many centuries before Florence Nightingale, this Muslim woman introduced nursing to the Arabic world\\" She hailed from the Bani Aslam tribe in Medina and was among the first people in Medina to accept Islam.Kasule, Omar Hasan Sr. (November 1998) 9811 - Historical Roots of the Nursing Profession in IslamIslamic Medical Education Resources, retrieved January 3, 2012 . Rufaidah received her training and knowledge in medicine from her father, a physician, whom she assisted regularly. At the time when Muhammed's early followers were engaged in war, she led a group of volunteer nurses to the battlefield to treat and care for the injured and dying. After the Muslim state was established in Medina, she was given permission by Muhammed to set up a tent outside the mosque to treat the ill and to train more Muslim women and girls as nurses.Kasule, Omar Hasan Sr. (2008-05-17) Historical Roots of the Nursing Profession in IslamIslamic Medicines Forum, retrieved April 26, 2010 Rufaidah is described as a woman possessing the qualities of an ideal nurse: compassionate, empathetic, a good leader and a great teacher. She is said to have provided health education to the community, helped the disadvantaged (like orphans and the disabled), advocated for preventative care, and even to have drafted the world’s first code of nursing ethics . Nursing in hospitals In hospitals built in the Medieval Muslim society male nurses tended to male patients and female nurses to female patients.Syed, Ibrahim B. Efficient Hospitals: Islamic Medicine’s Contribution to Modern Medicine The Imam Reza Website, retrieved April 26, 2010 The hospital in Al- Qayrawan (Kairouan in English) was especially unique among Muslim hospitals for several reasons. Built in 830 by the order of the Prince Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya (817–838), the Al-Dimnah Hospital, constructed in the Dimnah region close to the great mosque of Al Qayrawan, was quite ahead of its time.Zaimeche, Salah (September 2004) Al-Qayrawan (Tunisia) Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization, retrieved April 26, 2010 It had the innovation of having a waiting area for visitors, not to mention that the first official female nurses were hired from Sudan to work in this hospital. Moreover, aside from regular physicians working there, a group of religious imams who also practiced medicine, called Fugaha al-Badan, provided service as well, likely by tending the patients’ spiritual needs.

Saint Gobnait of Ballyvourney is a sixth-century patron saint of beekeepers. Beekeeping in Ireland has been practiced for at least 2000 years and has seen a surge in popularity in modern times, evidenced by the numerous organizations promoting and assisting beekeeping. Despite the increased pressures on bees and beekeepers through new diseases and loss of habitat, there are now in excess of 3,500 members within beekeeping associations. History =From early to modern beekeeping= Honey bees were brought to Ireland, most likely from Britain, sometime after the end of the last ice age. Solinus in the 3rd century A.D. makes mention of Ireland as having \\"few bees\\". The earliest reference from within Ireland about bees are in the Bee Judgements of the Brehon Laws which among other issues dealt with the ownership and value of swarms, the compensation paid by the beekeeper to a person stung by one of his bees and the compensation paid to the beekeeper if a person's hens began eating his bees. The Brehon Laws began to be codified about 438-441 A.D. having been handed down orally from previous generations, they contain no Latin loan words relating to bees or beekeeping, which provides further evidence that beekeeping vocabulary was established before the arrival of Christianity in about 430 A.D. However legend has it that St. Modomnoc first brought bees to Ireland from Wales in the early 540's A.D. just after the effects of the extreme weather events of 535–536 A.D. would have been subsiding. A \\"great mortality of bees\\" was recorded in 950 A.D., and again in 992 A.D. when it was said that \\"Bees were largely kept in Ireland at this time, and were a great source of wealth to the people\\". In 1443 A.D \\"the third epizooty of bees\\" was recorded. The first beekeeping book in Ireland was Instructions for managing bees in 1733, it included recommendations for the use of skeps and stipulated the best size to use to encourage at least one swarm per year with two afterswarms to follow. The bees would traditionally have been killed at the end of each season, often with the use of brimstone matches, to be able to extract the honey and wax. However, by the mid-1700s boxes for keeping bees had begun to be used and methods of extracting the honey and wax, without killing the bees, were being devised. In the 1870s Brother Joeseph, a Carmelite monk from Loughrea, imported a Bar and Frame Hive from Mr. Abbott of London and then began to produce his own versions, he is also recorded as being one of the first to import the Ligurian Italian honey bee (A. m. ligustica) with a view to selective breeding \\"..as being more prolific.. and harder workers.. would improve our home breed (the Irish strain of A. m. mellifera)\\". In 1881 the Reverend George Proctor was believed to be the first in the country to own Langstroth Hives (invented in 1852) with their moveable frames, which subsequent modern hives are based upon. In 1912 the Isle of Wight Disease (IoWD) arrived in Ireland, wiping out the indigenous native Irish Black Bee (A. m. mellifera), Ireland was restocked with A. m. mellifera imports mainly originating from Hollund, but also from France. =Formation of the Associations= In 1880 the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) decided to tour Ireland with a \\"bee tent\\" to show modern beekeeping equipment and manipulations of bees to the public. They were joined by Brother Joseph, throughout much of Ireland as he continued on his \\"holy crusade\\" for the honey bee; he later proposed the formation of an Irish beekeeping association \\"for promoting and instructing the improved methods of bee culture to the cottagers of Ireland\\". In 1881 the Irish Beekeepers Associations (IBKA) was formed, holding a honey show in Dublin; in 1908 their name was changed to Irish Beekeepers' Association (IBA), in 1939 it was wound up due to decreasing membership. In 1943 the County Dublin Beekeepers' Association was formed, from which an attempt was made to revive the old IBA to form an all Ireland body. On St. Patrick's Day in 1944 the Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations was formed; the recently formed Ulster Bee Keepers' Association (UBKA) did not associate themselves with it. In 1926 the Banbridge and District Beekeeping Association was formed; in 1934 its name became the Northern Ireland Bee Keepers' Association. In 1942 the UBKA was formed and in 1951 the smaller NIBKA affiliated with it and was later absorbed into it. In 1949 there were 6,000 beekeepers with 16,000 hives, the most common of which was the CDB Hive. At the 14th Annual Conference in 1959 a lecture was given entitled \\"How to take advantage of the Buckfast strain of bees, to be shortly introduced into Northern Ireland\\". At the 15th Annual Conference in 1960 a member of the Ministry of Agriculture gave the lecture \\"The Buckfast Strain of Honeybee and its dissemination throughout Northern Ireland\\". In 1966 at the 21st Annual Conference of the UBKA it was decided that all subsequent Conferences should be held at Greenmount Agricultural and Horticultural College; it was also at this conference that the Ministry of Agriculture informed the UBKA \\"that due to the increase of Nosema, the Buckfast Queen distribution scheme was being suspended\\", a scheme initially begun to improve the local bee stock (the A. m. mellifera imported after the IoWD). In 1966 the FIBKA raised the subject of forming an All-Ireland Beekeepers' Alliance but the UBKA unanimously rejected the suggestion, opting instead to support continued co-operation. Honeybee diseases, pests and poisons =Varroa= Presently the Varroa destructor mite is the single greatest threat to bee colonies in Ireland. If left untreated colonies will die within three to four years, although typically after the initial infestation there can be a rapid increase in the mite population which would lead to colony collapse. Varroa mites arrived in Ireland in 1998 and in several years had spread throughout most of the island. The mortality rate for over-wintered colonies during 2015/16 in the Republic of Ireland was 29.5% and for Northern Ireland was 28.2%; for comparison Wales was 22.4% and Scotland was 18%, the European average was 12%. As a result of varroa, wild colonies do not survive for long; feral colonies, swarms that have escaped from apiaries, will die within a short time, however their homes can be re-occupied afterwards by new swarms for the cycle to repeat. These feral colonies can become a source of large varroa populations, this and the fact that varroa has shown resistance to previously effective treatments can result in regional losses as high as 40-60%. On the occasions where feral colonies appear to be able to survive with varroa on a long term basis, closer study has discovered that the local strain of varroa have become non-lethal as opposed to the bees becoming resistant. or in which the varroa acts as a host to a non-lethal Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), both of which are exceptionally rare and non-reproducible, therefore a Parasite Management System must be maintained to continually manage the varroa mite. As an alternative to treatment against the varroa mite and in the hope to re-establish a wild population, in 2013 a Varroa Tolerance Breeding Program was set up by NIHBS, focusing solely on the A. m. mellifera, in conjunction with several breeding groups throughout Ireland, including the Galtee Bee Breeding Group (GBBG) whose apiary manager, Micheál Mac Giolla Coda (a former President of BIBBA, FIBKA and founding member of NIHBS), in 2012 stated that \\"the plan is to harness the bee’s natural defences against the mite\\" by improving the bees \\"grooming and hygiene habits\\" through selective breeding \\"by observing the number of damaged mites\\" without DNA analysis nor the use of Instrumental Insemination; in 2009 research was published that showed that marks on mite's exoskeletons, previously attributed as damage caused by grooming was more likely to be mere \\"regular dorsal dimples (indentations)\\"; in 2018 it was announced that varroa resistant Buckfast bees would be made available for sale in 2019, modern methods of breeding, such as Instrumental Insemination, had been used to impart this genetic trait into the wider Buckfast population. To date there has been no progress of such breeding projects towards imparting varroa resistance into the A. m. mellifera population in Ireland. Research, in co-ordination with NIHBS, was conducted in 2017 to determine if the A. m. mellifera in Ireland possessed varroa resistant characteristics, which had been observed in other A. mellifera such as the Buckfast bee, based on an Executive Summary the conclusion was that it possessed no such resistance against the varroa mite (the paper has yet to be fully published). =Acarine= Acarine or as it was known at the time, the Isle of Wight Disease (IoWD), was first reported in England on the Isle of Wight in 1906 where it wiped out 75% of colonies in the first year and later arrived in Ireland by 1912, in several years it had spread throughout most of the island. By 1923 \\"the country was swept clean of bees\\", by 1927 the IBA requested the government to adopt a restocking scheme for re-population and also for \\"importation of (resistant) Queen bees for re-sale at reduced prices\\", many of the local bee Associations had already begun to import their own stocks, having chosen not to wait on the government assistance. The majority of the bees were Dutch A. m. mellifera, with their characteristic swarminess. Modern DNA analysis, in 2017, has shown that the majority of Irish bees in Ireland are Dutch A. m. mellifera with the second largest group of A. m. mellifera originating from France, and smaller amounts of DNA originating from Norway and Switzerland. In 1921 the cause of the IoWD was found to be the Acarapis woodi a tracheal mite, its common name Acarine is due to it belonging to the subclass Acari. The Varroa mite is also a member of this subclass and therefore treatments against Varroa in its phoretic stage will also be effective against Acarapis woodi. In 2004 research was conducted to determine how the differences in the tracheas of various subspecies of Apis mellifera related to Acarapis woodi, it was found that A. m. macedonica, in which the Acarapis woodi are absent, has significantly smaller (up to 21%) measurements for its tracheas when compared to A. m. carnica and A. m. ligustica, in which Acarapis woodi are present: The research put forward the size of the tracheas of honey bees as a possible explanation for certain subspecies, or strains within them, being more susceptible to Acarine than others; the larger the tracheas, the greater the susceptibility to Acarine. The A. m. mellifera is considered a large bee within Apis mellifera, especially when compared to A. m. carnica and A. m. ligustica. In 1945 Brother Adam, the breeder of the Buckfast bee, obtained \\"pure native\\" Old Irish Black Bee queens (an Irish strain of A. m. mellifera) that had survived the Acarine epidemic \\"from a secluded place in the far west of Ireland\\", from which he raised virgin queens and then crossed them with his Buckfast drones known to be resistant to Acarine, at his isolated Closed Mating Station on Dartmoor, however like the British Black Bee from which it was descended, these too also all died from Acarine, in 1983 Brother Adam wrote \\"the old English (and by inference Irish) brown bee… lives today only in the memory.. and was completely wiped out\\". =AFB and EFB= Originally both American foulbrood (AFB) caused by the spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae and European foulbrood (EFB) caused by the non-spore forming bacterium Melissococcus plutonius, were both referred to as Foul Brood and have been known in Ireland since at least 1897. In the Irish Bee Journal of 1901 \\"the rapid spread of foul brood, that most terrible pest\\" was discussed. They are both extremely infectious and persistent diseases affecting only the brood, spores of AFB can survive for up to 40 years. The adoption of modern beekeeping aided in the spreading of both these diseases, with the use of moveable frames, non-destruction of colonies each year and beekeeping equipment moving between apiaries. They are the two brood diseases which are notifiable in both jurisdictions of Ireland; in 1903 the Bee Pest Act was enacted throughout all Ireland and in 1945 The Bee Pest Prevention Act was enacted in Northern Ireland (which repealed the previous 1908 Act), UKBA and government officials worked closely to bring this about, initially the 1945 Act also included Acarine and Nosema as notifiable diseases reflecting their devastating effects on bee populations at the time. Bee Inspectors have been appointed to regularly inspect beehives and testing facilities have been established for beekeepers to have the contents of their hives diagnosed for disease, these services are provided free of charge. In 1945 in Northern Ireland, 14% of hives inspected (including unoccupied) were found to contain AFB, however by 1949 this had been reduced to 2.8%, but in 1950 11.9% of unoccupied hives inspected contained AFB spores. Although Oxytetracycline tetracycline, an antibiotic, can be used for treatment against EFB, it is dependent on the Bee Inspector, it used to be a treatment against AFB however it and all other treatments for AFB are now illegal. The only course of action that can be taken once AFB is confirmed in the hive by a Bee Inspector with the use of a field testing kit, is for the hive to be sealed at night and the entire hive and bees to be burned. In both cases a ban on moving anything from the apiary during the outbreak will be imposed. =Other bee diseases and pests= The other usual diseases of the honey bee are present in Ireland, although currently it is believed that Ireland is free from the Small Hive Beetle (Aethina tumida Murray) and Tropilaelaps mercedesae. =Pesticide poisoning and forage destruction= Of the agricultural chemicals used, it is the fungicides and the insecticides that can affect bees the most. Fungicides may pass into pollen and then into the bee bread. Also some fungicides are synergistic with some acaricides used to combat varroa, magnifying their effect on the bees themselves. From agriculture there is widespread use of pesticides which probably cause serious harm to insects including bees, along with widespread destruction of habitat which is essential for bee foraging. Organisations The main beekeeping organizations in the Republic of Ireland are the Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations (FIBKA) and the Irish Beekeepers Association/Cumann Beachairí na hÉireann (CLG), while in Northern Ireland the main beekeeping organizations are the Ulster Beekeepers Association (UBKA) and the Institute of Northern Ireland Beekeepers (INIB). There are also a number of other organisations within Ireland, including the Native Irish Honey Bee Society (NIHBS) and the Irish Buckfast Beekeepers Association (IBBA). =Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations (FIBKA)= FIBKA is the largest organisation of beekeeping associations in Ireland, claiming to be established in 1881 and re-constituted 1943.FIBKA history FIBKA is a not-for-profit federation of beekeeping associations in Ireland with currently 60 affiliated associations which between them have over 3,500 members. FIBKA's goals include promotion of the conservation of the A. m. mellifera which they call \\"the native dark bee\\" as stated in their Constitution. Advertisements for the sale of other types of bees, such as the Buckfast bee, are regularly shown in their publications. FIBKA runs a summer course in beekeepingFIBKA Summer Course every year since 1961. This is held at Gormanston, Co. Meath in Gormanston College and holds examinations in the full range of beekeeping education, from the preliminary exams up to Honey Judge. FIBKA is a signatory, contributor to, and supporter of the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, and is a member of the European Professional Beekeepers Association, the Council of National Beekeeping Associations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the UK National Honey Show, and the Tree Council of Ireland. =Irish Beekeepers' Association CLG (IBA)= The IBA is \\"a democratic and egalitarian company, founded in October 2017\\", as an \\"alternative organisation (to FIBKA)\\" their stated goals are \\"to be Open, Fair and Transparent in all Our Actions for Our Members and to promote Beekeeping for all Beekeepers\\" ... \\"throughout the island of Ireland\\", they \\"hope to create an environment of mutual respect and understanding, so that no beekeeper ever feels marginalised or ostracised because of the type of bee they keep\\". They offer membership insurance for both the North and South of Ireland, also offering individual membership not just association membership. It provides facilities and benefits comparable to those available from FIBKA, although it is necessarily smaller in both membership (21 association members) and the number of available lecturers due to its recent establishment. They support and endorse the All-Ireland Pollinator plan as well as the National Heritage Plan. =Native Irish Honey Bee Society (NIHBS)= The NIHBS states that they promote the conservation, study, improvement and re-introduction of A. m. mellifera, which they call \\"the native Irish honeybee\\" (Article 5.i. of the Constitution). They support research into this area with a number of Irish universities, working with and obtaining financial aid from Government Departments, relating to the genetics of A. m. mellifera with a focus on Varroa tolerance, the conclusion of which found \\"that the selected (Native Irish Black) bees not alone have the capability of controlling the number of Varroa mites in a hive\\", the full findings of the 2017 research has not been published. In 2018 results from DNA analysis was published, which found that the bees being kept by NIHBS members largely originated from the Netherlands, having been imported since 1923 after the indigenous Irish Black Bee (an Irish strain of A. m. mellifera) had been eradicated by the Isle Of Wight Disease; \\"...amongst the beekeepers in the NIHBS, these (Dutch bees) are the predominant type of A. m. mellifera, here (in Ireland) reflecting the significant imports by beekeepers from the Netherlands after the loss of managed colonies during Isle of Wight disease\\", other countries identified as origins of the bees sampled were from France, Norway and Switzerland. The research also concluded \\"97.8% of sampled bees were determined to be pure\\" and \\"genetically diverse\\" A. m. mellifera. The NIHBS was listed as a co-author and co-funder of the research. Membership commits a beekeeper to promoting the NIHBS \\"Aims and Objectives\\" otherwise they \\"may be encouraged to join\\".. \\"another beekeeping body\\", by keeping a different bee other than that promoted by the NIBHS would contravene clause 5.i. of their Constitution, upon which a member could be expelled. They also aim \\"to establish areas of conservation throughout the island for the conservation of Apis mellifera mellifera\\", in the same manner as has been established on the islands of Colonsay and Oronsay in Scotland, where it is now a legal offence to keep any other bee except A. m. mellifera. =Irish Buckfast Beekeepers Association (IBBA)= The IBBA promotes the keeping and breeding of Buckfast bees in Ireland. It is affiliated with the Federation of European Buckfast Beekeepers’ Associations, an international group of breeders dedicated to maintaining and improving this bee breed, but supports beekeepers irrespective of the type of honeybee kept by the beekeeper. A controlled open mating area has been established within the Five Glens area of north County Leitrim, to enable Buckfast beekeepers to bring their virgin Buckfast queens to be mated with Buckfast drones. =Ulster Beekeepers Association (UBKA)= The UBKA was formed in 1942 and is an association of the 12 affiliated local beekeeping associations in Northern Ireland. UBKA also works in partnership with FIBKA in the development of beekeeping education, and is a member of the Council of National Beekeeping Associations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The UBKA holds an Annual Conference at the CAFRE Greenmount Campus site in Antrim. =Institute of Northern Ireland Beekeepers (INIB)= The INIB was formed in 2001. Members automatically become members of the BBKA. The INIB holds an Annual Conference and Honey Show at Lough Neagh Discovery Centre, Oxford Island, with its primary focus being the promotion of beekeeping through education and to this effect works closely with the UBKA.

His compositional output includes more than 200 songs, choral pieces, and works for solo piano and organ. He is particularly remembered for his anthems, which have been performed widely in North America. Some of his better-known works include the anthems Saviour, Breathe an Evening Blessing, O Little Town of Bethlehem, and Come unto Me; and the song Rose-Bud.  Life and career  Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Ambrose was the son of composer and organist Robert Ambrose and the grandson of organist Charles Ambrose. His cousin, pianist Ellen Ambrose, founded the Duet Club of Hamilton in 1889. He began his musical training in the piano and the organ as a young child with his father. In 1886, at the age of 18, Ambrose moved to New York City to assume the post of organist-choirmaster at Madison Ave Methodist Episcopal Church where he remained for nearly 5 years. While in New York he pursued further musical studies with Dudley Buck (orchestration), Kate Sara Chittenden (piano), Bruno Oscar Klein (composition), and Albert Ross Parsons (piano). He later taught music history at the American Institute of Applied Music in New York in the early years of the 20th century. In 1890 Ambrose moved to Trenton, New Jersey to become the organist-choirmaster at St James Methodist Episcopal Church, a post he held through 1917. In 1904 he became music director at the New Jersey State Normal School (now The College of New Jersey), where he remained until his retirement in 1934. He notably served four terms as president of the National Association of Organists while living in the United States. After his retirement, Ambrose lived the rest of his life in Hamilton, where he served as guest organist at the Christ Church Cathedral. In 1939 he was elected president of the Royal Canadian College of Organists. He died in Hamilton in 1941 at the age of 72.

ActA is a bacterial surface protein comprising a membrane-spanning region. In a mammalian cell the bacterial ActA interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and actin monomers to induce actin polymerization on the bacterial surface generating an actin comet tail. The gene encoding ActA is named actA or prtB.Uniprot P33379  Introduction  As soon as L. monocytogenes bacteria are ingested by humans, they get internalized into intestinal epithelium cells and rapidly try to escape their internalization vacuole. In the cytosol they start to polymerize actin on their surface by the help of the ActA protein. It has been shown that ActA is not only necessary but also sufficient to induce motility of bacteria in the absence of other bacterial factors. =Discovery= ActA was discovered by analysing lecithinase-negative Tn917-lac Listeria mutants because of the phenotype that they were unable to spread from cell to cell. These mutant bacteria still escaped from the phagosomes as efficiently as wild-type bacteria and multiplied within the infected cells but they were not surrounded by actin like wild-type bacteria. Further analysis showed, that Tn917-lac had inserted into actA, the second gene of an operon. The third gene of this operon, plcB, encodes the L. monocytogenes lecithinase. To determine whether actA itself, plcB or other co-transcribed downstream regions are involved in actin assembly, mutations in the appropriate genes were generated. All mutants except the actA mutants were similar to wild-type concerning association with F-actin and cell-cell spreading. Complementation with actA restored wild-type phenotype in the actA mutants.  Function  Fig. 1 Actin assembly induced by bacterial protein ActA (shown in green). Mammalian proteins involved in this process are: Profilin (P), Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and actin-related-protein 2 and 3 complex (Arp2/3 complex) as well as actin. ActA is a protein which acts as a mimic of Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a nucleation promoting factor (NPF) present in host cells. NPFs in the mammalian cell recruit and bind to the already existing actin-related-protein 2 and 3 complex (Arp2/3 complex) and induce an activating conformational change of the Arp2/3 complex. Due to this conformational change, NPFs initiate polymerization of a new actin filament at a 70° angle, which leads to the characteristic Y-branched actin structures in the leading edge of motile cells. ActA localizes to the old pole of the bacterium and spans both the bacterial cell membrane and the cell wall, lateral diffusion is inhibited; thus ActA localizes in a polarized and anchored manner on the bacterial surface. Consequently, actin polymerization only starts in this region on the surface of the bacterium. Expression of ActA is induced only after entering a mammalian host cell. Actin filament assembly generates the force that pushes the bacterium in the mammalian host cytoplasm forward. Continuous actin polymerization is sufficient for motility in the cytoplasm and even for infection of adjacent cells. =Research= New data indicates that ActA plays a role also in vacuolar disruption. A deletion mutant of ActA was defective in permeabilizing the vacuole. An 11 amino acid stretch of the N-terminus of the acidic region (32-42) was shown to be important for disruption of the phagosome.  Structure  The primary proteinous product of the actA gene consists of 639 amino acids and includes the signal peptide (first N-terminal 29 amino acids) and the ActA chain (C-terminal 610 amino acids). Therefore, the sequence of the mature ActA protein consist of 610 amino acids. ActA has a molecular weight of 70,349 Da and is a surface protein. ActA is a natively unfolded protein which can be divided into three functional domains (Fig. 2): *N-terminal domain that is highly charged: amino acid residues 1-234 *central domain with proline-rich repeats: amino acid residues 235-394 *C-terminal domain with a transmembrane domain: amino acid residues 395-610 =N-terminal domain= Fig. 2 The ActA protein and its functional domains The first 156 amino acids of the N-terminal domain consist of three regions (Fig. 2): *A-region with a stretch of acidic residues: 32-45 *AB-region, an actin monomer-binding region: 59-102 *C-region, a cofilin homology sequence: 145-156 The N-terminal portion of ActA plays an important role in actin polymerization. The domain displays consensus elements present in eukaryotic WASP family NPFs which include an actin monomer-binding region as well as an Arp2/3 binding C (central or cofilin homology) and A (acidic) region. The actin monomer-binding region of ActA has functional properties like the WASP-Homology-2 (WH2) or V domain, but differs in the sequence. Thus in WASP-family NPFs the order of the domains is WH2 followed by C, and then by A, which is not the case in ActA. =Central domain= The central proline-rich region of ActA is crucial for ensuring efficient bacterial motility. There are four proline-rich repeats containing either FPPPP or FPPIP motifs. These regions mimic those of the host cell cytoskeletal protein zyxin, vinculin and palladin, known to associate with focal adhesions or stress fibers. The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) can bind through its Ena/VASP homology 1 domain (EVH1 domain) to the central proline- rich region and recruits profilin, an actin monomer binding protein, which itself promotes polymerization at barbed ends of actin filaments. Furthermore, VASP seems to interact with F-actin through its carboxy-terminal EVH2 domain, which provides a linkage of the bacterium to the tail. This statement is supported by the fact that ActA can bind multiple Ena/VASP proteins simultaneously and has a high affinity between ActA and Ena/VASP. VASP has been shown to reduce the frequency actin-Y-branches in vitro and thus increases the proportion of filaments which are organized in a parallel alignment in comet tails. =C-terminal domain= The C-terminal domain of ActA has a hydrophobic region which anchors the protein in the bacterial membrane. In summary, besides *the absence of sequence homology in the actin- binding-region and *an alteration in the sequence of ARP2/3 activating domains typical for WASP-family NPFs (V(WH2)-C-A), *a major difference between ActA and host NPFs is that ActA does not have elements that bind to regulatory proteins such as Rho family GTPases. This structural difference between ActA and host NPFs can be advantageous for L. monocytogenes and its pathogenesis because the actin nucleation activity of L. monocytogenes is independent of host regulation.  Analogues  WASP/N-WASP, which is functionally mimicked by ActA, is highly conserved in eukaryotes. It is an important actin- cytoskeleton organizer and is critical for processes such as endocytosis and cell motility. Activated by Cdc42, a Rho-family small GTPase, WASP/N-WASP activates the Arp2/3 complex, which leads to rapid actin polymerization. = Actin-based motility of other pathogens = In Shigella the protein IcsA activates N-WASP, which in non-infected mammalian cells is activated by the GTPase Cdc42. Active N-WASP/WASP leads to actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, the Listeria ActA protein interacts with and activates directly the Arp2/3 complex. The Rickettsia RickA protein is also able to activate the Arp2/3 complex in a WASP-like manner. In contrast to Listeria, the actin filaments are organized in long, unbranched parallel bundles. The Arp2/3 complex is only localized near the bacterial surface and thus it is assumed that a more frequent Arp2/3 complex-independent elongation occurs. In Burkholderia pseudomallei BimA initiates actin polymerization in vitro. It is assumed that intracellular migration of this bacterium functions independently of the Arp2/3 complex.

Isoclinism was introduced by to help classify and understand p-groups, although it is applicable to all groups. Isoclinism also has consequences for the Schur multiplier and the associated aspects of character theory, as described in and . The word \\"isoclinism\\" comes from the Greek ισοκλινης meaning equal slope. Some textbooks discussing isoclinism include and and . Definition The isoclinism class of a group G is determined by the groups G/Z(G) (the inner automorphism group) and G′ (the commutator subgroup) and the commutator map from G/Z(G) × G/Z(G) to G′ (taking a, b to aba−1b−1). In other words, two groups G1 and G2 are isoclinic if there are isomorphisms from G1/Z(G1) to G2/Z(G2) and from G1′ to G2′ commuting with the commutator map. Examples All Abelian groups are isoclinic since they are equal to their centers and their commutator subgroups are always the identity subgroup. Indeed, a group is isoclinic to an abelian group if and only if it is itself abelian, and G is isoclinic with G×A if and only if A is abelian. The dihedral, quasidihedral, and quaternion groups of order 2n are isoclinic for n≥3, in more detail. Isoclinism divides p-groups into families, and the smallest members of each family are called stem groups. A group is a stem group if and only if Z(G) ≤ [G,G], that is, if and only if every element of the center of the group is contained in the derived subgroup (also called the commutator subgroup), . Some enumeration results on isoclinism families are given in . Isoclinism is used in theory of projective representations of finite groups, as all Schur covering groups of a group are isoclinic, a fact already hinted at by Hall according to . This is used in describing the character tables of the finite simple groups .

A Shepreth branch line was built by the Eastern Counties Railway from Shelford Junction (later called Shepreth Branch Junction) to Shepreth, and in time the line from Hitchin to Shepreth Branch Junction was regarded as a single unit. The Royston and Hitchin Railway was absorbed by the Great Northern Railway in 1897. For many years the line competed with the Great Eastern Railway line for Cambridge to London traffic, and the route became famous for the Cambridge Buffet Express trains. After 1923 the two routes were under the same ownership but continued to operate in a form of competition. In 1978 an electrically operated passenger service operated between London and Royston, and nearly all through journeys required a change of train at Royston. In 1987 the rest of the line was electrified, and became the primary route for Cambridge to London journeys, the service on the alternative former Great Eastern Railway route being downgraded outside the commuter peaks hours. The line remains in heavy use today. Beginnings The Eastern Counties Railway completed its main line from London to Norwich on 30 July 1845, running from the south through Cambridge and on to Ely.D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume V: The Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, , page 105 Cambridge was an important industrial and agricultural centre.Gordon, pages 135 and 136 The year 1846 was a peak time for the authorisation of railway schemes, part of the railway mania. The Great Northern Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 26 June 1846; this was a huge project: it was to build a line from London to York, with a number of small branch lines.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 477 and 478 The Royston and Hitchin Railway had been submitted to Parliament as a proposed Cambridge and Oxford Railway, which would have run as a single track through Royston, Hitchin and Dunstable, but the scheme was very considerably cut back by the Lords in Parliament; there were other contenders in the field for occupation of the route. The railway as actually authorised, on 16 July 1846, was renamed the Royston and Hitchin Railway, and the Lords demanded double track for the truncated version.Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 – 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 17 and 23D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: V: The Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, , page 145 The Great Northern Railway had encouraged the Cambridge and Oxford Railway scheme, (now the Royston and Hitchin Railway) and had guaranteed the shareholders 6% on paid-up capital. The GNR wanted to use the line to get access to Cambridge, and at all costs it wanted to keep the Eastern Counties Railway out. If the ECR could seize control of the R&HR; it would have yet another penetrating line into GNR territory. The Eastern Counties Railway had secured approval for a Cambridge to Bedford line in 1847, and the GNR tried to get its Cambridge connection using that line, but this attempt failed too, in 1848.Gordon, page 146 Extending to Shepreth However the Royston and Hitchin Railway had more success: on 14 August 1848 it obtained an Act to extend its line from Royston to Shepreth, joining the Cambridge to Bedford branch there. If the Eastern Counties failed to construct its Cambridge to Bedford line in a reasonable time, the R&HR; would have power to build the line itself.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 31 and 32Grinling, page 78 Construction of the Royston and Hitchin Railway was not difficult and not expensive, and the miles from Hitchin junction to Royston were opened on 21 October 1850. The route was hilly and the line had a series of gradients. Beyond Royston the line, still under construction, was also beset by gradients, one as steep as 1 in 100. The line served a purely agricultural district, but a connecting bus service ran between Royston and Cambridge.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 55, 56 and 61 The extension of 5 miles 4 chains to Shepreth was brought into use on 1 August 1851. A service of five daily omnibuses between Shepreth and Cambridge was laid on, taking 40 minutes for the 9 miles. The fastest combined journey from King's Cross to Cambridge was 130 minutes by the 09:15 northern express. Fares were lower than on the ECR, but the service did not prove viable. For the time being the R&HR; was simply a short branch line in a purely agricultural area, and the GNR was paying nearly £15,000 a year because of its guarantee. Eastern Counties line to Shepreth The Eastern Counties Railway was compelled by a condition in its Act to open its line to Shepreth without undue delay; despite considerable prevarication, it opened from Shelford Junction to Shepreth on 1 April 1852, with works constructed for double line, although only a single line was laid. It was 5 miles 28 chains in length, and ran to an end-on junction with the R&HR; at Shepreth. The Board of Trade Inspecting Officer sanctioned opening only on condition that the ECR could use the R&HR; turntable at Shepreth. It seems that through carriages were worked between King's Cross and Cambridge. The ECR paid £300 per annum for use of Hitchin station. The ECR was always well behind in payment of rent, as was its successor, the Great EasternWrottesley, volume I, pages 75 and 76 During this period the Eastern Counties Railway had opened negotiations to lease the R&HR;, and a fourteen year lease had been agreed in February 1852, to start from the connection of the lines at Shepreth: the ECR would pay £16,000 per annum guaranteed rent and interest on the R&HR.; The GNR was not sorry to have passed over the financial obligation for the R&HR; to its rival. The GNR agreed to pay the ECR 60% of any earnings in respect of King's Cross and Hitchin traffic to and from Cambridge and stations east of Ashwell on the R&HR.; During the operation of the lease, the Railway Clearing House referred to it as the \\"Shelford & Hitchin Railway\\". Three daily services, subsequently four, with two on Sundays, were provided between Cambridge and Hitchin. The Eastern Counties and others merged and together formed the Great Eastern Railway, by Act of 7 August 1862.Cecil J Allen, The Great Eastern Railway, published by Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1968, page 46 Reversion to the Great Northern Railway Ashwell & Morden stationTowards the end of the lease period, the GNR gave consideration to taking over the R&HR; Company, but there was obstruction from the GER about actually reaching Cambridge over their tracks (from Shelford Junction). During the lifetime of the lease, the Bedford and Cambridge Railway had opened its line on 7 July 1862.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume IX: The East Midlands, David & Charles, Newtin Abbot, 1976, , page 28 The line was worked by the London and North Western Railway, which was friendly to the GNR at that time. The GNR therefore put forward two alternative proposals: one envisaged running powers from Shepreth to Cambridge, doubling of the track between Shepreth and the main line, use of the GER Cambridge station and a one mile extension to a separate terminal; the alternative was to be an extension from Shepreth to the Bedford and Cambridge Railway, joining it miles east of Lord's Bridge, with running powers over that line to the outskirts of Cambridge, and then a new two-mile branch would run to the town centre. The GER saw that if the second choice materialised, they would be left in possession of a useless short branch that ended at Shepreth, and they agreed to the GNR’s wishes, signing an agreement on 2 May 1864. An Act in that year conceded to the GNR full running powers to Cambridge station, where all facilities and a separate platform would be provided; double track capable of carrying express services was promised between Shepreth and Shelford by 31 March 1866, the last day of the lease, on the expiration of which the R&HR; line would be returned to the GNR.Wrottesley, volume I, page 149Gordon, page 147 Track maintenance shortcomings The ECR and later the GER were supposed to have kept the leased line in good order, but the GER was not in good financial health. In December 1865 GNR and GER engineers made a joint inspection of the R&HR; line. The stations and permanent way were in a state of dilapidation, and there were insufficient sleepers to each length of rail. The GNR's engineer demanded that 11,400 sleepers should be renewed. When the line was handed back on 1 April 1866, the sleepers had been supplied but not installed, and it was left to the GNR to put the road in order. Eleven miles had been relaid and 5,000 new sleepers inserted within three months; nevertheless on 3 July a fatal derailment occurred.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 163 and 164 Captain Tyler reported on the causes of the derailment. The permanent way was laid with 16-foot rails, and the joints were not fished. The sleepers were widely spaced, with only four for each rail length; many were \\"in the last stages of rottenness\\". The track geometry near the point of derailment was very poor (\\"wavy\\" in Tyler's words).Wrottesley, volume I, page 218 > I find that this portion of railway, which had been for some 11 years in the > charge of the Great Eastern Company, was taken over, at the expiration of > the agreement under which it was worked, by the Great Northern Company, on > the 1st April last.

This section had not been doubled as promised; nor was the accommodation provided at Cambridge, where there was no shelter for GNR passengers. W. Bell & Sons, the contractors for these works, had ceased operations when the GER was unable to pay them, leaving the GNR to advance £5,000 for the work to proceed. From 1 January 1868 the GNR provided its own staff at Cambridge for passenger traffic. Doubling the line between Shelford Junction and Shepreth was completed early in May 1867, and the electric telegraph was working between Hitchin and Cambridge a few months afterwards.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 24 and 25 As the GNR were maintaining the greater, western part of the line, they took over the maintenance of the Shepreth to Shelford Junction line, by arrangement for 21 years from 1 January 1874; the GE allowed £320 per mile per annum out of the tolls. Next it was resolved to re-signal the whole Cambridge line and install the block system. An intermediate box was erected at Letchworth, between Hitchin and Baldock, although at that time there was no station there. A new box and additional sidings were provided at Baldock in 1875. Two years later new boxes were built at Ashwell, Royston, Meldreth and Shepreth. The GER paid for new signalboxes at Harston and Foxton and improved the signalling at Shelford junction. Saxby & Farmer did the re-signalling and all the works were finished in April 1878. Letchworth Letchworth railway stationSir Ebenezer Howard published his book \\"Tomorrow a Peaceful Path to Real Reform\\"Ebenezer Howard, Tomorrow a Peaceful Path to Real Reform, 1898, reprinted 2010 by Cambridge University Press, in which he put forward the notion of a Garden City; his work included heavy reliance on a railway connection. As a direct result, the world's first Garden City was founded at Letchworth in 1903. Construction workers used a wooden halt there from 1903. Regular passenger services were provided at the halt from 15 April 1905; a goods depot was added on 19 August 1907, and a permanent station on 18 May 1913. This station had two island platforms, giving four platform faces, but they were never sued as such.Vic Mitchell and Allan Mott, Potters Bar to Cambridge, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2006, , plates 58 to 62 Train service to 1923 Slip carriages were slipped at Hitchin for the Cambridge line in the August 1872 timetable, off the 10:10 and the 14:45 from Kings Cross, at Hitchin for Cambridge. The up express due at Kings Cross at 11.55 am slipped at Hitchin for Cambridge.Wrottesley, volume II, page 38 Competition with the GER for London-Cambridge traffic was keen. In the summer of 1880, the GNR put on a noon express from Cambridge which was allowed only 75 minutes, with a Hitchin stop. It was one of the few up trains then which did not stop at Finsbury Park. The best down train, the Cambridge portion of the 17:00 from Kings Cross, took 80 minutes with Hitchin and Royston stops. At the end of 1883, the 12:00 Cambridge to Kings Cross was given a Royston stop, and the overall schedule increased to 77 minutes, which remained for some years. By 1888, the 17:00 from Kings Cross was allowed the same time, also with Hitchin and Royston stops.Wrottesley, volume II, pages 69 and 70 The GNR introduced an express service between King’s Cross and Cambridge (95 minutes, then 90 down, 100 up) from 1 April 1866. By 1883 up journeys of 75 minutes were possible but GER acceleration ended the possibility of effective competition and the GNR, while maintaining good speeds (in 1898 there were six down and five up trains in times of 77 to 82 minutes), wisely determined to concentrate on the development of traffic at intermediate points as much as at Cambridge itself. Acquisition by Great Northern Railway The Royston and Hitchin Railway company was acquired by the GNR by Act of 3 June 1897, effective on 1 July 1897 The twentieth century Hostility between the Great Northern Railway and the Great Eastern Railway cooled in the twentieth century. By arrangement GNR traffic staff were withdrawn from Cambridge in July 1912, but four GNR engines were still based there. There were still five or six fast trains each way between King's Cross and Cambridge. The 17:00 down made its 75 min trip with an additional Royston stop from 1912, but the best up trains took 80 minutes.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , page 133 In 1923 most of the main line railways of Great Britain were reorganised into one or other of four new larger companies, in a process called the \\"grouping\\", following the Railways Act 1921. The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway, the LNER. The Great Eastern Railway too joined the LNER, so that both routes between Cambridge and London were under the same ownership. In May 1932 five daily \\"Garden Cities Expresses\\" were run, at first taking 82 minutes down and 77 up, soon renamed \\"Cambridge Buffet Expresses\\". From July 1932 they were accelerated to 75 and 72 minutes respectively. They were suspended at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, but they were reinstated on 6 December 1948, with four daily services in times of 82 to 90 minutes. In the pre-war years the original three-coach formations had on occasion to be strengthened to as many as nine or ten coaches.Gordon, page 148 Since 1960 At Letchworth, Baldock and Royston considerable residential and industrial growth has occurred. At Letchworth, population had grown to 30,945 by 1971 and many of its industries (principally engineering, printing, food preparation and the making of clothing and furniture) had developed alongside the railway. In 1965 Letchworth despatched 64,197 tons of freight in full wagon loads and 8,554 in smaller consignments, while the station issued 151,295 ordinary and 2,795 season tickets, collecting 168,015. Farther to the north-west Foxton was linked to a cement works near Barrington by a short branch line sanctioned by a Light Railway Order of 1920. Electrification In the 1970s the Inner and Outer Suburban services from Kings Cross were electrified. The Inner Suburban service, to Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North was commissioned first, followed by the Outer service, which was electrified as far as Royston. The first Outer Suburban electric multiple unit was received in July 1977, and from 3 October some entered service on existing diesel timings. The full Royston electric service of three per hour, and up to seven in the peak, started on 6 February 1978. For the time being a diesel service operated in connection between Royston and Cambridge. In early 1978 ten sidings and a carriage washing plant were added east of Letchworth.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train: Electric Trains in Britain since 1883, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1988, , pages 183 and 184 Continuation of the electrification from Royston to Cambridge was authorised in March 1987,Terry Gourvish, British Rail 1974-97: From Integration to Privatisation, Oxford University Press, 2002, , page 220 the Bishop's Stortford to Cambridge section having been commissioned on 19 January 1987.

History and profile Rail Professional was established in 1996. The magazine was launched soon after privatisation with the aim of creating a forum for managers to communicate across the industry and stay abreast of developments in other companies. Under British Rail, managers met regularly with their counterparts across the UK, but the fragmentation of the railways into separate train operating companies made it harder for managers to remain up-to-date on developments outside of their own organisation. Rail Professional, launched by former British Rail manager Andrew Goodman, aimed to fill this gap.  Content  Rail Professional covers rail news from train operating companies, Network Rail, the Department for Transport and other organisations related to the UK rail industry, featuring expert analysis and case studies alongside interviews from the biggest names in rail in its monthly magazine and on its website alongside commentary from professionals that work in the railway industry in the United Kingdom and around the world.

In an article celebrating ten years of GBRF, there was some discussion of the difficulties faced by the freight industry and the tendency of Keith Heller, the then head of the UK's largest rail freight carrier DB Schenker, to be outspoken on such matters. John Smith is quoted as saying: 'Someone does need to say these things, but I think he's pissing in the wind. The same with longer trains, which he also talks about. But Keith's 60, he'll certainly be dead before anything changes!' After the article was published, a clarification appeared on First GBRf's website saying: 'The context of the remarks were made in reference to the frustrations and difficulties the freight industry faces compared to the passenger sector and John's remarks were intended to highlight the length of time it can take for freight issues to be addressed, as opposed to any slight on Keith himself.'GBRF archived press releases http://www.gbrailfreight.com/news_archive.php?&newsid;=611 Recruitment The magazine carries job adverts each month, primarily for senior management posts in the rail industry.

Life He was born on 26 January 1800 at Middleton Cheney, Northamptonshire, the second son of Ralph Churton, archdeacon of St David's. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he proceeded B.A. 1821, and M.A. 1824. After taking his degree he returned to his old school, and was for a few years an assistant-master under Dr. Russell. In 1830 Churton left Charterhouse to become curate to the rector of Hackney, London, John James Watson, afterwards his father-in-law; and for a short period he was headmaster of the church of England school at Hackney. In 1834 Archbishop William Howley gave him the living of Monks-eleigh in Suffolk, and eighteen months later Bishop William Van Mildert bestowed on him the rectory of Crayke. Churton left Oxford before the tractarian movement arose, but was largely in sympathy with it; he was one of the 543 members of Convocation who thanked the proctors for their attitude with regard to the proposed condemnation of Tract XC. He remained at Crayke till his death. In 1841 Archbishop Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt appointed him to the stall of Knaresborough in York Minster, and in 1846 made him archdeacon of Cleveland. Following the death of his younger brother Rev. William Ralph Churton (8 September 1802 - 29 August 1828), he named his son William Ralph Churton the younger (1837-1897). Works In the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology he edited John Pearson's minor theological writings, and also one of the Vindiciæ Ignatianæ, with a Latin preface defending in a scholarly fashion the genuineness of the Ignatian epistles against modern critics. He was a contributor to the British Critic, and when James Burns brought out The Englishman's Library, Churton and his friend William Gresley were the editors, and Churton contributed a volume on The Early English Church. His views on church matters were seen in his biography of Joshua Watson. In 1848 he printed A Letter to Joshua Watson, Esq., in which he established that the Contemplations on the State of Man published in 1684 as a work of Jeremy Taylor's was in reality a rifacimento of the English translation (1672) by Sir Vivian Mullineaux of the treatise by Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, a Spanish Jesuit, called Diferencia de lo Temporal y Eterno. For the amusement of his children he translated three plays of Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Juan Pérez de Montalván, as well as a number of ballads. He, however, visited Spain just once, in 1861, and did not get further than the Basque provinces. A paper called A Traveller's Notes on the Basque Churches, printed in the sixth volume of the reports of the Yorkshire Architectural Society, was the result of this tour. His major work in Spanish studies was Gongora, an Historical and Critical Essay on the Times of Philip III and IV of Spain, with Translations, 1862. Like John Bowle's edition of Don Quixote, it was composed in a country parsonage. It is accompanied by a series of translations not only from Góngora, but also from Herrera, Villamediana, Luis de León, Calderon, and Cervantes. After Churton's death in July 1874, a volume of Poetical Remains was published (1876) by his daughter, containing, besides a number of original poems, versions from Spanish poets and also some from Anglo-Saxon. A distinct evolution seems perceptible in Churton's work, from the structured theologigal and philosophical preoccupation of his early work, towards the rather more sentimental, national and poetic work of later years.

Turkey's smoking ban includes provisions for violators, where anyone caught smoking in a designated smoke-free area faces a fine of 69 Turkish lira (~€15/$18/£13) and bar owners who fail to enforce the ban could be fined from 560 liras for a first offence up to 5,600 liras. The laws are enforced by the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority. History Smoking was first banned in 1997 in public buildings with more than four workers, as well as airplanes and public buses. On 3 January 2008, Turkey passed a smoking ban for all indoor spaces including bars, cafés and restaurants. It also bans smoking in sports stadia, and the gardens of mosques and hospitals. The smoking ban came into force on 19 May 2008; however, bars, restaurants and cafes were exempted until mid-July 2009. On 19 July 2009, Turkey extended the indoor public smoking ban to include bars, restaurants, village coffeehouses and hookah bars. The ban also forbids smoking advertising and the depiction of people smoking on television. Many foreign programmes or films that have scenes with characters smoking will usually have the cigarettes blurred out.Hurriyet Daily News, 16 February 2010, Turkey fines channel for smoking villains in Tin Tin In December 2018 the law was changed to require plain packaging of all tobacco products. Health warnings messages and images must cover both sides of packages and at least 85% of the packaging. Progress is still being made in educating the public about the law. Actual enforcement of the ban is still being implemented. The president of the Istanbul branch of the Environmental Engineers' Chamber (ÇMO), Eylem Tuncaelli, said that the smoking ban is a way for political leaders to avoid dealing with the country's real air pollution problems. See also: Regie Company Prevalence A Gallup poll in May 2007 revealed that over half of Turks aged 15 to 49 had smoked on the day before the survey. This was the highest rate among the 100 countries surveyed, along with Lebanon (41%), Greece (40%), and Cuba (40%) in descending order.A blow to Turkey's new smoking ban 30 JUL 2012 The figure went down to 12% in females and 40% in males in 2015, according to World Bank. Illicit Tobacco Turkey suffers from a severe and growing incidence of illicit tobacco consumption, spanning contraband and counterfeit tobacco products. In 2013 the estimated scale of illicit tobacco traffic in Turkey rose to 16.2 billion cigarettes per year. Smoke and mirrors in Turkey with illicit cigarette trade May 2014 According to the World Health Organization this problem is exacerbated by weak governance and a lack of high-level commitment to investigate and prosecute these crimes, ineffective customs and border controls, as well as complicity from within the tobacco industry, notably from the producers of precursor materials used in the manufacture of cigarettes. While the overall consumption of tobacco in Turkey has declined over the last thirty years, the price of cigarettes rose 4.17% annually between 1970 and 2006, driven in large part by successive layers of VAT and excise taxation. Tobacco Control in Turkey The impact on street price for legitimate (taxed) products creates a lucrative market for illicit cigarettes that do not pay taxes and thus realize that margin as additional profit. Turkish security officials estimate the annual loss in tax revenue from illicit tobacco at around $9.5 billion. Loss in Tax Revenue from Cigarette Smuggling in Turkey over 5 years Counterfeit cigarettes are primarily purchased by younger and lower-income smokers, further exacerbating the health hazards universally acknowledged to be even worse than those associated with commercial tobacco products. According to the European Parliament budget control committee, an estimated 40 percent of smuggled cigarettes sold in Turkey are produced in Bulgaria by the Bulgartabac company. Syrian children exploited in sale of smuggled cigarettes in Turkey These cigarettes are shipped first to Iraq, then smuggled into Turkey across the southeastern border. Methods of transit lean heavily on the exploitation of children in war-torn Syria. Effect of laws The sales of outdoor heaters have increased because entertainment venues provide heated outdoor seating for smokers. In July 2009 a customer shot and killed the owner of a restaurant in the southwestern town of Saruhanli because he was angry that his cigarettes had been confiscated. A member of the state media watchdog commented on the television blurring in 2010: \\"Hülya Alphas said the blurring effect being employed so frequently works against the ban because it increases attention attracted to smoking by disrupting the concentration of viewers.\\" See also Air pollution in Turkey References Turkey Category:Politics of Turkey Category:Health in Turkey ","title":"Smoking in Turkey"},{"id":"27114362","text":"Empis borealis is a species of dance flies in the fly family Empididae. It is found in most of Europe, except the Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Region and the Iberian Peninsula. The brown wings of the female are very broad, while the male fly’s wings are narrower. This particular species of fly exhibits sex- role reversal in its mating process, with female flies aggregating in swarms to compete for male choice. Female fly swarms change their flying behavior in the presence of males, who present nuptial gifts to females before mating.  Description  E. borealis E. borealis are empidids, commonly known as dance or balloon flies. Adult E. borealis are small- to medium-sized flies, about 6 to 8 mm long, with dark brown wings. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism in several attributes. Firstly, the fly's wing size depends on whether the fly is male or female. Females have broad wings, about 60% larger than those of the males. Males and females also differ in abdomen tip shape. Females have a pointed tip, while males have a larger tip with a hypopygium, or abdominal segment, that supports the copulatory structure. The species can be easily identified in the field because it is the only empidid species present during May. One of the species’ common names is the balloon fly, which refers to the male flies’ practice of bringing nuptial gifts in a woven silk abdominal “balloon” to the females before mating. With their prey caught in these \\"balloons\\", male flies approach a swarm of females for mating. 183x183px  Distribution  E. borealis is reported to be the most common empidid species in the colder parts of Scandinavia, though the fly’s distribution ranges east to west from western Siberia to Great Britain and north to south from Scandinavia to the Alps.  Food resources  Adult E. borealis consume both nectar and smaller insects. Male flies tend to prey on soft-bodied insects. In one study, female flies only consumed prey during mating.  Mating  E. borealis mating E. borealis exhibits sex-role reversal, with females aggregating in swarms to compete for male choice, and males offering nuptial gifts to potential female mates. = Swarming = Female flies usually swarm together in groups of about five to ten flies, with some containing up to 40 flies. Swarming occurs near bushes or trees, from about 8:00am to 7:30pm. Female swarming depends highly on the weather. If conditions were windy or cloudy, researchers observed females resting until the weather improved. After one or two females began swarming again, the rest of the females would follow suit. Researchers have observed a continuous equilibrium between the number of females resting and swarming at each swarm site. At any given time, the number of females at a swarm site consists of both those swarming and those resting. The total number of females at a swarm site then includes both the swarming and resting female flies. Swarms generally range from 0.5 to 1.5 m in diameter, with the swarms being 0.5 to 6 m above the ground.  Swarm sites  275x275px The position of E. borealis swarm sites varies throughout the day. As the day progresses, females seek sunnier sites as their current sites turn to shade. The largest swarms have been found during high daytime near coniferous trees in a mixed forest habitat. = Swarm site fidelity = This species of fly in particular has shown evidence of fidelity towards swarm sites; female flies continue to use the same sites that females have used in the past for mating. One study found that the number of females using various swarm sites across a period of four years was consistent. Although the number of females among different swarm sites varied, it did remain relatively similar across multiple mating seasons. Some sites are known to have been used for up to 18 years.  Female flight behavior  Female flying patterns vary depending on the presence or absence of male flies. When males are absent, female E. borealis exhibit slow, cruising flight or hovering with sudden up-down movements. However, in the presence of male flies, female flight behavior becomes erratic and has much more rapid movement. If a male with prey enters the swarm, the number of females in the swarm increases. Females that were previously resting at the swarm site landmarks would take off and join the swarm. If males approach a swarm site with all the females resting, females usually take off and begin to swarm. However, if the female flies do not begin to fly, male flies make a few quick circles around the landmark where the females are resting. This action by the male generally incites swarming in the female flies. E. borealis mating = Nuptial gifts = Adult male E. borealis are known to present females with gifts before mating. Researchers have determined that there is a positive correlation between gift size and duration of copulation. When the nuptial gift that males brought was larger, the female would spend more time eating the gift, which prolonged the time of copulation. There were some instances in which prey size was large but copulation time was short. In these cases, the female fly’s spermatheca may have already been filled with sperm, rendering the male unable to transmit any of his own sperm, or prey volume may have been decreased from male consumption or use in a previous mating. = Male choice = Female flies compete for male choice, and researchers have observed that male E. borealis do discriminate among potential female mates at swarm sites. In one study, female flies with larger wings participated disproportionately in copulations at each swarm site, but male size and the size of nuptial gifts did not show a correlation with the size of the mating female. Moreover, male flies spent more time in large swarms and were more likely to leave smaller swarms without mating than larger swarms.

Located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, the small community is named after the Jérémie Islets that are just off its shores and mark the western end of the Jérémie Islets Bay (French: baie des Îlets-Jérémie). The Innu call the hamlet Ishkuamishkut, meaning \\"where one expects polar bear\\". The islets were named in turn after a certain Noël Jérémie, or Lamontagne, who was born between 1629 and 1638, and died between 1694 and 1697. Around 1660, he established a trading and fishing company. In 1673, the first reference was made to the Îlets-Jérémie Post (later on also written as Îlets-à-Jérémie or Îlets-de- Jérémie) by François de Crespieul. That year, Noël Jérémie was a clerk at the Tadoussac post, but he often went to the islands with his son Nicolas to conduct fur trade with the Innu of Betsiamites and vicinity. Nicolas became an interpreter and clerk of the Hudson's Bay Company, and wrote the famous Relation du Détroit de la Baie d'Hudson, published in 1720. He died at Quebec City in 1732. After periodic closures, the post became the property of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1831, and was considered as the best trading post on the North Shore. It closed permanently in 1859 and operations were transferred to Betsiamites. The community on the mainland has existed at least since 1735 when the Saint Anne chapel was first built. French Jesuit Jean-Baptiste de la Brosse (1724–1782) taught the local Innu reading and writing skills in their own language. Consequently, the Innu of Les Îlets-Jérémie adopted the Latin script and exhibited an unexpected degree of literacy in the 18th century.

It is a significant commercial activity that provides those involved with honey, beeswax, royal jelly, queen bees, propolis, flower pollen and bee pollen. Honeybees also provide pollination services to orchards and a variety of seed crops. Many beekeepers keep bees as a hobby. Others do it for income either as a sideline to other work or as a commercial operator. These factors affect the number of colonies maintained by the beekeeper. History Hive beekeeping was well established before the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43.Crane, Eva (1999), The world history of beekeeping and honey hunting, New York, Routledge, p.251 Skeps or baskets made from wicker or coils of straw or grass were used as hives to house the bees and protect them from the weather and predators. Modern beekeeping In the winter of 2008, about 20% of the UK's bees died. The losses were highest in the north of England and lowest in the east. These winter losses subsequently increased in the following years as some of the treatments used to combat Varroa lost their efficacy. New treatments have since been licensed for use in the UK to reduce the losses. The government researches bees at its National Bee Unit, run by the Food and Environment Research Agency at Sand Hutton in North Yorkshire, close to A64. The Bees Act 1980 is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that seeks to stop the damage caused by diseases, chemicals (such as Imidacloprid and pests that damage the well being of bees). It repealed the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1941. The act has never been put into force, and currently does not extend to Northern Ireland. The National Bee Unit is responsible for the delivery of the Bee Health Programme in England and Wales. It is based in Sand Hutton in North Yorkshire. The National Honey Show, the first of which was held 1923 at The Crystal Palace, is an annual British show of honey and other bee products. The BBKA Spring Convention is an annual event which has 20+ Lectures; 60+ Workshops & Seminars for beekeepers of all abilities. It would have been held at Harper Adams University in Shropshire on 3-5 April 2020, however has been cancelled due to the Coronavirus Pandemic.

Stoneleigh Park, British Beekeepers Association, 2011. represents amateur beekeepers in England. There are many local associations, within the county associations, which are within the BBKA. The association is a registered charity. It is based at the National Agricultural Centre in the National Beekeeping Centre, where it has been since July 2000, although it has been at Stoneleigh since 1982. Previous to 1943 it was based on Bedford Street in London. From these premises, the Beekeepers' Record and British Beekeepers' Journal were published. The Ulster Beekeepers Association (UBKA) represents the interests of amateur beekeepers in Northern Ireland. The Scottish Beekeepers Association (SBA) is the national voluntary body in Scotland representing beekeeping and beekeepers nationally and internationally. The Welsh Beekeepers Association (WBKA) represents the interests of Welsh amateur beekeepers. The Bee Farmers' Association of the UK (BFA) is the voice of professional beekeeping in the United Kingdom (UK). As the industry trade association, it currently represents around 450 bee farming businesses. Its members produce honey throughout the UK and supply products in bulk, for wholesale and for retail. In addition, the association provides contract pollination services to growers. Bee Diseases Insurance (BDI)Bee Diseases Insurance (BDI) offers insurance against notifiable diseases for beekeepers in England and Wales. The Confederation of National Beekeepers Associations (CONBA) represents the above associations in Europe.  Examinations board  The National Diploma in Beekeeping Examination boardNational Diploma in Beekeeping Examination board was established in 1954 to meet a need for a beekeeping qualification, above the level of the certificates awarded by the Beekeeping associations. It was originally intended as an appropriate qualification for County Beekeeping Instructors and Lecturers, of which there were some forty full- and part-time appointments across the United Kingdom at that time. The prime movers in this development were Fred Richards, the C.B.I. for Norfolk and H.M.I. Franklin, whose brief included rural education. Although the County Lecturers have disappeared from the beekeeping scene since the privatisation of the agricultural colleges, there are still beekeepers wishing to pursue their studies to an advanced level. The NDB offers them the opportunity to undertake such study.

Slavery is largely ignored for most of the novel, save only for a brief discussion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in Chapter 12.Criswell, R. (1852) \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" Constrasted with Buckingham Hall, the Planter's Home New York: D. Fanshaw  Plot  The novel follows Eugene Buckingham, the only son of a South Carolina planter, as he crosses paths with Julia Tennyson, a Scottish American journalist who has written a number of pamphlets under various pseudonyms. What begins as mutual friendship eventually evolves into love, despite the anxieties of the opposing fathers. Col. Buckingham – Eugene's father and a (fictional) descendant of the Duke of Buckingham – contests the partnership on the grounds that Julia has written pamphlets degrading all planters as vicious sadists, even though he is not. Likewise Dr. Tennyson – Julia's father and a Scotsman – objects because he supports the view of all planters as violent and cruel. The Tennysons eventually make their way to South Carolina from New York, and after several philosophical discussions regarding American slavery, Eugene and Julia are allowed to marry. The story ends as the newlyweds embark on a ship to England for their honeymoon.  Publication  The novel was first published in 1852 in hardback form by D. Fanshaw of New York City.

(1861-1934) was an English orientalist landscape and genre painter, author and illustrator. Early life Kelly was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, the son of Irish landscape and portrait painter, Robert George Kelly. He left school in 1876 to take up work in a firm of cotton traders, but was also received an art education from his father, exhibiting under the name R. G. Kelly Jnr. In North Africa An Arab cafe in Cairo (from Egypt Painted and Described, 1902) He travelled to Egypt several times. Khatib, H., Palestine and Egypt Under the Ottomans: Paintings, Books, Photographs, Maps and Manuscripts, I.B.Tauris, 2003, pp 110 In the early 1880s, inspired by the places he saw while on vacation on an ocean cruise ship, Talbot-Kelly decided to take up his father's profession. He left his employment in 1882, travelled by boat to North Africa, and settled in Egypt in 1883, acquiring a studio in Cairo and becoming fluent in Arabic. He travelled throughout the country, writing about and painting the people and scenes he encountered both in towns and in the desert. He spent a considerable time with the Bedouin tribes who he described and illustrated in his 1902 book, Egypt Painted and Described (A & C Black). As his name became known he also earned an income from private commissions. He stayed in Egypt until 1915 when for reasons of health and age he returned to London - though he continued to paint constantly. Egypt Painted and Described, his first illustrated travel book, was published in 1902 (by A & C Black), and was an account of his impressions and experiences of that country during his long stay there; an exhibition of his Egyptian views was also held at the Fine Art Society in the same year. His paintings and writing showed a great empathy and respect for local people and culture, especially that of the desert Bedouin Arabs. Prior to publishing his books on Egypt, Kelly provided illustrations for Von Slatin's Fire and Sword in the Sudan (1896). He also travelled to Iceland. In Burma Kelly travelled to Burma, which he wrote about and painted for two books published by A & C Black, Burma Painted and Described (1905) and Burma (1909). The former contains reproductions of 73 of Kelly's paintings and the latter contains 12 reproductions, all of which also appeared in the first book. On his trip through Burma and the paintings he left of the country, Kelly had a significant impact on the early 20th century development of Burmese painting. In Burma, he is believed to have met and taught the basics of Western painting to a major painter of Burma, M.T. Hla (U Tun Hla) (1874–1946), and the paintings of Maung Maung Gyi (painter) (1890–1942) and Ba Ohn (c.1877-fl.1924) show clear influence of Kelly's style in certain works, to the point, in one case, of an exact replica. The latter two painters may possibly have met Kelly and received some instruction from him, but this would not have been necessary for Kelly's influence to have occurred. Kelly's two books were widely available in Burma, or so were postcard reproductions, which were sold in Burma, of the paintings in his books.See Ranard pp 52-53, 57-61, 63-64. Kelly also did fine art reproductions of his watercolors on Burma (dated 1912) which today sell widely on the internet. His media and professional memberships Talbot-Kelly worked mainly in watercolour and black and white. He was a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI), Royal Society of British Artists (RBA), Royal British Colonial Society of Artists (RBC) and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). He was President of the Liver Sketching Club in Liverpool in 1917 and also a member of the Artists' Club Liverpool, of which his father, Robert George Kelly, was a founder member. His death Kelly died in London in 1934. He was married and had a son, Richard Barrett Talbot Kelly (1896–1971), MBE MC RI, who was also an artist, specialising in bird painting and historical subjects and an illustrator and who was a Lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery in the First World War.

Kentish for the training of Commonwealth senior officers of all services in inter-service cooperation. It was established as part of a wider attempt by the British Army to create a coherent training plan for its officers. History The School was originally intended for senior officers of the British Army who aspired to battalion command and to ensure that all such candidates received suitable training. It was taken as an affront by some senior officers of the day, who resented the implication-true in some cases-that they were incapable of delivering the necessary training. The School attempted to widen officers' outlook by including in its syllabus subjects that were not immediately military but led to an appreciation of the wider political, geographical and technological environment in which the British Army would operate. The School was originally based at Aldershot but in the 1920s, it was transferred to Sheerness. It then moved to Erlestoke Park in Wiltshire in 1939 where it continued to operate until June 1950 when a major fire caused it to move to the wings of the house; the school closed completely in 1961. There was also a parallel establishment, the Senior Officers' School, Belgaum, at Belgaum in India.

The Embassy also covers the country of Belarus as part of its mandate. The Embassy is located at ulica Jana Matejki 1/5 in Warsaw, down the street from the Polish Sejm.  History  Embassy of Canada to Poland in 1970 Prior to 1970, the Embassy of Canada to Poland was located in a rented office on ulica Katowicka. The initial Embassy building was opened in 1970 at ulica Jana Matejki 1/5, which was then torn down for the construction of the current building. The Embassy has a perpetual lease on the grounds from the City of Warsaw. Designed by architect Voytek Gorczynski, the new facility is more than double the size of the building it replaced, and it has won acclaim since its official opening in 2001. The Embassy was named Best Building of the Year in 2001 by Polish Business News, Best Public Building in 2002 by the City of Warsaw, and it received a special citation from the Association of Polish Architects for the Best Architectural Design in 2001. The Embassy's architectural design includes an emphasis on open spaces and natural light, which represent the Canadian values of transparency and openness. Expanding on these themes are a three-storey sky-lit lobby and a double-height multi- purpose room called the Canada Room, which is used for formal receptions and presentations. The building is three storeys in height, with a French limestone and aluminum exterior.  The Two Rocks Monument  The Two Rocks Monument The Two Rocks monument was unveiled in 1999 by the then Prime Ministers of Canada and Poland – Jean Chrétien and Jerzy Buzek. The inscription on the monument says: \\"These two rocks, one from Poland and the second from Canada, commemorate Polish and Canadian soldiers, who fought side by side during World War II.\\" One rock originates from Wilno (Canada) and the other from the Kashubian region in Poland, symbolizing the coming together of the Canadian and Polish people. On August 21, 2009, the Embassy of Canada to Poland commemorated the 65th anniversary of the Battle of Falaise in France, during which the allied forces of Canada and Poland defeated the German troops.

History The Rugby League Conference was founded in 1997 as the Southern Conference, a 10-team pilot league for teams in the South of England and English Midlands. It expanded into North Wales for the first time in 2004 when North Wales Coasters joined the North West Division of the Rugby League Conference. The professional side Crusaders announced in December 2009 that they would leave the South Wales town of Bridgend an relocate to Wrexham in North Wales. On the back of this, the North Wales League, a proposed feeder league for the Rugby League Conference was announced in 2010. There were intended to be four teams for the initial season: Conwy Celts established 2007 (based at Colwyn Bay); two new sides: Penrhyn Eagles (from Bangor, where there was already a university club) and Mid Wales Marauders (based in Welshpool, the only rugby league club in mid Wales) and Rhyl Exiles, who while technically a new club were formed from the ashes of recently disbanded club Rhyl Coasters (formerly North Wales Coasters). Rhyl won the North Wales 9s but pulled out of the league. Chester Gladiators A were proposed as replacements but in the end the season was cancelled. There was no open-age league in North Wales in 2011; but the North Wales Conference got off the ground in 2012. The inaugural competition consisted of Conwy Celts, Dee Valley Dragons, Montgomeryshire Marauders, Prestatyn and Rhyl Panthers and Wrexham Bradley Raiders. Montgomeryshire Marauders folded mid-season and were replaced by Flintshire Falcons. The grand final was fought out between the top two sides: Conwy Celts and Prestatyn and Rhyl Panthers with the Celts running out 48–26 winners to be crowned the first North Wales Champions.

For many years, its focus was on promoting public access to beaches and forests, particularly to the Øresund Strait and the Jægersborg Deer Park. By 1912 it was campaigning against litter, with the slogan \\"Sandwich wrappers and egg shells don't look pretty in forest pools!\\"Dansk Skovforening, Dansk Skovforenings Tidsskrift (1948), p. 260 (In Danish, \\"Madpapir og Æggeskaller pynter ej i Skovens Haller!\\")Jens Kr.

By 1925, the Society had over 3,000 members, and in the same year it changed its name to the Danish Society for Nature Conservation (Danmarks Naturfredningsforening), signifying that it had gained a nationwide status. In 1937, as the result of the intervention of the Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning, the Nature Conservation Act was modified to give the Society a statutory status in conservation matters. In 1987, the Society's membership peaked at 260,784. However, although competition with similar bodies has now led to a fall to some 140,000 members, it remains the largest nature conservation and environmental organisation in Denmark. The Society has more than ninety branches and employs a secretariat of some fifty people.About Us page at dn.dk Its national offices are at Masnedøgade 20, Copenhagen.Contact Information at dn.dk Publications As well as books and leaflets, the Society publishes the quarterly journal Natur og Miljø ('Nature and Environment'),Michael Salzman, ed., The World of Learning 2004 p. 462 online with a circulation of around 160,000.Danske tidsskrifter - Danmark at mediavejviseren.dk (page in Danish) Chairmen *1911-1915: Alfred Hage (1843-1922), landowner and politician *1915-1921: Valdemar Michael Amdrup, lawyer and banker *1921-1960: Erick Struckmann (1875-1962), painter *1960-1963: Vagn Jensen, senior civil servant in the Ministry of Education Presidents *1963-1984: Valdemar M.

Originally from New York City, Mattera started in conservative political activism as a student at Roger Williams University. In 2010, Mattera released his first New York Times bestseller, Obama Zombies. Mattera's second book, Hollywood Hypocrites, was published in 2012, and his third book, Crapitalism, was published in 2014, all by Simon & Schuster. Mattera was editor of Human Events magazine from 2010–12, and from 2010–13 hosted a weekend talk show on New York City station 77 WABC. In 2015, Mattera became a correspondent for the syndicated TV series Crime Watch Daily, which is produced and syndicated by Warner Bros. He has received two Emmy nominations for his work on the show. Personal background and education Born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Mattera is of Italian and Puerto Rican descent. Jason Mattera is one of five children of Joseph and Joyce Mattera, senior pastors of a Brooklyn church. Mattera grew up in Sunset Park, BrooklynTweet: \\"@DraftRyan2012 Cool. I grew up in Sunset Park.\\" Twitter: April 22, 2012. and graduated from Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School in 2001. In 2005, Jason Mattera graduated summa cum laude from Roger Williams University with a Bachelor of Science degree in business management and communications. Career =Writing= In 2010, Mattera wrote his first book, Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation. That book debuted at #14 on The New York Times best-seller list for hardcover non-fiction. Stephen Gutowski at Human Events praised the book, which he said \\"well chronicles how liberals have taken advantage of and brain-washed\\" college-aged voters. Ann Coulter called Obama Zombies \\"piercing, eye-opening, and deliciously witty\\" and said it \\"is required reading for an entire generation who have been sold liberal lies.\\" In Obama Zombies, Mattera writes that \\"For an entire year, otherwise clear- thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in American history fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history.\\" \\"The result,\\" he continued, was \\"an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history.\\" In 2012, Mattera published his second book, Hollywood Hypocrites: The Devastating Truth About Obama's Biggest Backers. Like Mattera's first book, Hollywood Hypocrites was a New York Times bestseller. An ambush video intended to promote this book received significant attention. In mid-March 2012 Mattera confronted comedian Chris Rock at a Sundance Film Festival after party over remarks that Rock made calling the Tea Party movement racist. The video shows Rock lunging for the camera. On why he wrote the book, Mattera says \\"It's time to recognize the marketing and fund-raising power the Hollywood Progressives wield. It's time to dig into the data and set the record straight. It's time to turn the media spotlight back on the image makers and prevent the Hollywood elite from hoodwinking American voters once again.\\" The late Andrew Breitbart called Hollywood Hypocrites a \\"barrage of body blows to Hollywood's holier-than-thou limousine liberals,\\" while Mark Levin praised the book as \\"eye-popping, exhaustively researched, and absolutely hilarious.\\" In 2014, Mattera published his third best-selling book, Crapitalism: Liberals Who Make Millions Swiping Your Tax Dollars, which \\"reveals the infuriating schemes that result when the filthy rich combine cronyism and capitalism\\" and, according to Mattera, \\"pulls back the curtain on a cast of cronyites who make millions taking advantage of taxpayers—and still brag about how they're looking out for the little guy.\\" The American Spectator reviewed Crapitalism as a \\"full-throated utterly vernacular defense of free-markets.\\" Also in 2012, Jason Mattera wrote the foreword to the book Walk in Generational Blessings: Living a Legacy of Transformation Through Your Family by his father Joseph G. Mattera.Mattera, Jason. Foreword. In Mattera, Joseph G. Walk in Generational Blessings: Living a Legacy of Transformation Through Your Family. Destiny Image Publishers, 2012, pp. 13-18. Mattera's articles have appeared on websites including the Washington Post, Breitbart's Big Journalism, National Review Online,Townhall.com, Human Events, The Daily Caller, and Hot Air. In March 2010, Mattera was named the editor of Human Events, making him the youngest editor of any national periodical. He remained editor until March 2012. =Campus activism= At Roger Williams University, Mattera was chairman of the Campus Conservatives organization and editor in chief of campus conservative newsletter The Hawk's Right Eye. The New York Times reported that The Hawk's Right Eye \\"upset college officials with its critiques of Islam and homosexuality. In 2003, the College Republican National Committee named Mattera the Best State Chairman, and Young America's Foundation recognized him as a top college conservative activist for two years. In response to a 2003 appearance by Judy Shepard, whose son Matthew Shepard was murdered for being gay, The Hawk's Right Eye published articles accusing \\"militant homosexuals\\" who supported hate-crime legislation of opposing free speech and a gay-rights group of indoctrinating students. University president Roy Nirschel responded: \\"While we affirm the right of campus organizations to hold different points of view and to disagree, the university will not condone publications that create a hostile environment for our students.\\" Administration also temporarily halted funding for printing The Hawk's Right Eye. Mattera defended his newsletter and claimed that campus conservatives were victims of censorship and anti-Christian bigotry. In 2004, Mattera attracted national attention for creating the Whites Only Scholarship worth $50 to highlight, what he said, was the inequity of racial preferences. Having received a $5,000 scholarship from the Hispanic College Fund, Mattera felt that racial scholarships promoted by the University gave him \\"an inherent advantage over my white peers.\\" He told The New York Times that the scholarship was an obvious parody of others specifically available only for minorities: \\"If you are a white student on campus, you don't have anyone helping you, there is no one compiling a list of scholarships just for you, Why is it that only students of color have this?\\" Sixteen people applied for the Whites Only Scholarship by February 2004. The Rhode Island Republican Party criticized the scholarship for allegedly being racist, which Mattera said actually proved the point of the parody: that the widespread racial preferences enacted across academia are, indeed, racist. =Aggressive journalism= On YouTube, Mattera posts videos of him confronting politicians. Mattera's unscheduled interviews have included Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Al Franken, Congressman Barney Frank, House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer, Congressman Charlie Rangel, Congressman Alan Grayson, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Bernie Sanders, Robert Gibbs, among others, and have garnered millions of views. Mattera's video of Vice President Joe Biden's gained notoriety when Biden stood by his claims that \\"murder will continue to rise, rape will continue to rise, all crimes will continue to rise\\" if a Democratic Party spending bill was not passed. Biden's office then filed an official complaint against Mattera. In 2014, Mattera created headlines when he asked Hillary Clinton if she would inscribe her book \\"Hard Choices\\" to Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador murdered in Benghazi. In 2015, Mattera turned his attention to the world of crime, starring in the Warner Bros. television show \\"Crime Watch Daily.\\" \\"If you see [correspondent] Jason Mattera...coming at you, you run the other way. That's not a good day for a criminal,\\" said Senior Executive Producer Lisa Gregorisch-Dempsey. Mattera's segments have run the gamut, from investigating murder mysteries, cold cases, suspicious suicides, and questionable disappearances, to tracking down murder suspects, identity thieves, and confronting scam artists, like a woman who pretended to be a doctor and faked her son's cancer to raise money. =Speaking= In 2010 Mattera spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). In his speech, he stated: \\"Students are subjected to a bombardment of liberal talking points throughout their collegiate careers.\\" He also compared CPAC to the Woodstock Festival and added: \\"Except that our women are beautiful, we speak in complete sentences, and our notion of freedom doesn't consist of snorting cocaine, which is certainly one thing that separates us from Barack Obama.\\" Mattera also impersonated comedian Chris Rock, according to a Kate Zernicke report in the NY Times, in attacking \\"diversity\\" and proclaiming \\"Get your government off my freedom!\\" The validity of Zernick's Rock-impersonation characterization was challenged by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, who said \\"[Mattera] happens to be from Brooklyn! He's using his voice!\\"Beam, Christopher, \\"'Media Is Everything. It's Everything.' Slate's 2010 profile of Andrew Breitbart\\", Slate.com, March 15, 2010. Breitbart went on to say to Zernick in absentia relative to her purported mis-characterization, \\"You're despicable ...

They were established in 1965 by the English epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill and their exact application and limits of the criteria continue to be debated. Definition In 1965, the English statistician Sir Austin Bradford Hill proposed a set of nine criteria to provide epidemiologic evidence of a causal relationship between a presumed cause and an observed effect. (For example, he demonstrated the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.) The list of the criteria is as follows: # Strength (effect size): A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal. # Consistency (reproducibility): Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect. # Specificity: Causation is likely if there is a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship. # Temporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay). # Biological gradient (dose-response relationship): Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence. # Plausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge). # Coherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that \\"... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations\\". # Experiment: \\"Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence\\". # Analogy: The use of analogies or similarities between the observed association and any other associations. # Some authors consider, also, Reversibility: If the cause is deleted then the effect should disappear as well. Debate in epidemiology Bradford Hill's criteria had been widely accepted as useful guidelines for investigating causality in epidemiological studies but their value has been questioned because they have become somewhat outdated. In addition, their method of application is debated. Some proposed options how to apply them include: # Using a counterfactual consideration as the basis for applying each criterion. # Subdividing them into three categories: direct, mechanistic and parallel evidence, expected to complement each other. This operational reformulation of the criteria has been recently proposed in the context of evidence-based medicine. # Considering confounding factors and bias. # Using Hill’s criteria as a guide, but not considering them to give definitive conclusions. # Separating causal association and interventions, because interventions in public health are more complex than can be evaluated by use of Hill’s criteria An argument against the use of Bradford Hill criteria as exclusive considerations in proving causality is that the basic mechanism of proving causality is not in applying specific criteria--whether those of Bradford Hill or counterfactual argument--but in scientific common sense deduction. Others argue that the specific study from which data has been produced is important, and while the Bradford Hill criteria may be applied to test causality in these scenarios, the study type may rule out deducing or inducing causality, and the criteria are only of use in inferring the best explanation of this data. Debate over the scope of application of the criteria includes, whether they can be applied to social sciences. The argument proposes that there are different motives behind defining causality; the Bradford Hill criteria applied to complex systems such as health sciences are useful in prediction models where a consequence is sought; explanation models as to why causation occurred are deduced less easily from Bradford Hill criteria because the instigation of causation, rather than the consequence, is needed for these models. Examples of application Researchers have applied Hill’s criteria for causality in examining the evidence in several areas of epidemiology, including connections between ultraviolet B radiation, vitamin D and cancer, vitamin D and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, alcohol and cardiovascular disease outcomes, infections and risk of stroke, nutrition and biomarkers related to disease outcomes, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases. They have also been used in non-human epidemiological studies, such as on the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bees. Their use in quality improvement of health care services has been proposed, highlighting how quality improvement methods can be used to provide evidence for the criteria. Since the description of the criteria, many methods to systematically evaluate the evidence supporting a causal relationship have been published, for example the five evidence-grading criteria of the World Cancer Research Fund (Convincing; Probable; Limited evidence – suggestive; Limited evidence – no conclusion; Substantial effect on risk unlikely).the Continuous Update Conclusions Mean American Institute for Cancer Research, n.d., retrieved 13 June 2017 See also   References Category:Epidemiology ","title":"Bradford Hill criteria"},{"id":"27115566","text":"Dr Nirmala Visweswara Rao (born 29 May 1969) is a classical dancer in kuchipudi and Bharathanatyam Early life She was born to the Kamana Ramchandar Rao and Seetha Maha Lakshmi.

His compositional output consists mainly of church music and works for solo piano and organ. Some of his more well known works are A Concert Overture for organ (1895), the patriotic song Hail Canada (1911), and Tintamarre, Morceau de Salon (1911), all of which were published by Whaley, Royce & Co. The latter piece was notably the first published classical composition to thoroughly integrate true tone clusters. He also wrote the textbooks Form in Music and A Treatise on Harmony, both of which were widely used in music schools in North America. Life and career Born at Ashbury in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), Anger studied at New College, Oxford where he earned a Bachelor of Music. He began his career as a school teacher and a church organist-choirmaster in his native country. He was notably the conductor of the Ludlow Choral and Orchestral Society for several years. In 1897 his cantata A Song of Thanksgiving was awarded the Jubilee Prize by the Bath Philharmonic Society. In 1890 his madrigal Bonnie Belle won the London Madrigal Society Prize. In 1893 Anger emigrated to Canada when he was appointed to the music faculty of the Toronto Conservatory of Music where he was made head of the music theory department. He also worked as an examiner for the University of Trinity College for many years. In 1894 he was appointed organist-choirmaster at the Church of the Ascension, leaving there in 1896 to assume a similar position at Old St Andrew's Presbyterian Church. He left St Andrew's in 1902 when he became organist-choirmaster at Central Methodist Church. From 1896-1898 Anger served as the conductor of the Toronto Philharmonic. He was appointed president of the Canadian Society of Musicians in 1895 and was for several years the dean of the Ontario chapter of the American Guild of Organists.

The forts saw combat during the First World War in the defense of Reims. The fort is located about north of the town of Sillery, next to the N44 road, between Reims and Châlons-en-Champagne. Constructed as a supporting position for larger forts and disarmed in 1913, it saw the heaviest fighting of the Reims forts. It was bombarded during the war and remains in a state of ruin.  Description  The Fort de la Pompelle was built between 1880 and 1883 to complete the fortification belt around Reims that was started by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. This secondary work was planned to support the principal forts of Witry- les-Reims, Nogent-l'Abbesse, Brimont, Saint-Thierry, Fresnes and Montbré. The relatively small rectangular fort was surrounded by a ditch defended by two- level caponiers. With a surface area of , it was provided with six 155mm de Bange 1881 guns, four 138mm guns and a variety of lesser pieces. An artillery company of 277 men garrisoned the fort. In 1917-18 a number of underground passages were cut from the chalk to provide access points a few hundred meters to the rear of the fort.  First World War  The fort was disarmed in 1913, immediately prior to the First World War. During the offensives of 1914, the fort was briefly taken by German forces on 4 September. Following the First Battle of the Marne it was reoccupied by French forces of the 138th Infantry Regiment on 24 September 1914. The fort then became a principal part in the defense of the Reims sector. In the remainder of the war, the fort was assaulted and bombarded many times by the Germans, but never changed hands again. A total of 180 different regiments, including two special Russian brigades sent by Tsar Nicholas II in 1916 would defend the fort in turn. The garrison was supported by naval artillery stationed on the canal between Sept Saulx and Courmelois, which bombarded the German lines. The fort saw particularly strong assaults in the spring of 1918 in the Second Battle of the Marne, when it was assaulted three times, on 1 June with fifteen tanks. Each assault was repelled by the elements of the 1st Colonial Infantry Corps. The fort was depicted in the 1931 Raymond Bernard movie Le Croix de Bois.  Abandonment and restoration  After the First World War, the Fort de la Pompelle was abandoned for nearly forty years and was finally listed for sale by the Administration des Domaines in November 1955. Supported by veterans' groups, the fort was purchased by the Fédération Nationale André Maginot which sold the site to the city of Reims for one symbolic franc.  Musée du Fort de la Pompelle  Classified as an historic monument on 23 March 1922, the fort is today a museum, inaugurated on 10 November 1972.

It was built in 1874 and was razed beginning in 1957, making way for expansion of the French nuclear research facility at Fontenay-aux-Roses. The fort was named for the town it was designed to protect, Châtillon-sous-Bagneux, but the greater portion of the site is actually within Fontenay-aux-Roses. The main entry and the portions in Châtillon were destroyed at the end of the Second World War.  History  The site was first fortified during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when the redoubt of Châtillon was built by the inhabitants of the town. The works allowed the French to slow the Prussian advance on the capital and was the scene of violent combat. After the war the site was selected for further fortification as part of the Séré de Rivières system ring of fortifications around Paris. Construction on the new pentagonal fort started in 1874, not far from the old redoubt. Unlike other Parisian fortifications, the new fort was designed for action in all directions, as the location commanded much of the surrounding region. The barracks, believed to have been in three levels, were located at the center, surrounded by walls defended by a ditch and caponiers. The fort featured a number of internal traverses, mounded dikes intended as shelters against low-angle shellfire from a variety of directions. Nearby was the Coupure de Châtillon, a fortified ditch about to the northeast of the Fort de Châtillon, defended by artillery batteries. With the Fort de Châtillon, the defenses denied the use of the Châtillon hill to an enemy who might dominate the nearby Forts de Montrouge, Issy and Vanves. The coupure consisted of eighteen traverses covered by artillery and defended by caponiers in the ditch. The entire fortification has vanished with the encroachment of urbanization. The fort saw no particular action during the Second World War. After the French Liberation, convicted collaborators Joseph Darnand and Jean Hérold-Paquis were executed by firing squad at the fort. After the war the fort changed vocation to serve the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, the French atomic energy agency (CEA), and was the site of Zoé, the first French nuclear reactor. The Châtillon site was quickly superseded by a new atomic research facility at Saclay, which opened in 1952.  Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux-Roses (CEN-FAR)  In 1957 the Fort de Châtillon changed its name to the Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux- Roses. Only the entry and some buildings of the old fort were saved. The rest was demolished between 1957 and 1970. From 1974 the site housed a tokamak fusion reactor prototype, the TFR. It became difficult to maintain such activities in the densely populated area, and Zoé was shut down in 1977. The site became more oriented to other areas of nuclear research, particularly in the areas of radiation protection and nuclear waste management. The site also accommodates administrative services of the CEA. A 1996 fire in the administration building precipitated a change in use. A portion of the building that housed Zoé became the Museum of the Atom, while the remainder was dedicated to research into the life sciences. Several buildings on the site remain dedicated to the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (Nuclear Safety Authority) (ASN) and the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (Institute for Protection and Safety against Nuclear Radiation) (IRSN). The site is no longer spoken of as the \\"Fort\\" or \\"Annex\\", but as CEN-FAR or IRSN Fontenay-aux-Roses.  Other Forts de Châtillon  Other Forts de Châtillon include one at Châtillon-le-Duc near Besançon, as well as a Fort de Châtillon at Boulogne-sur-Mer built in the 16th century.

It was built in 1947 at the Fort de Châtillon in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a suburb of Paris. Design work for the heavy water reactor was started in 1947 by Frédéric Joliot-Curie, who was at the time director of the French atomic energy agency Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA). The project manager was Lew Kowarski, who had just returned from Canada, where he had supervised the construction of the Canadian ZEEP heavy water reactor. Zoé was activated on 15 December 1948, reaching a power of 150 kW by 1953. The nuclear fuel was provided by Bouchet of Ballancourt-sur-Essonne, which reprocessed the irradiated fuel and extracted the first milligrams of French-produced plutonium. The reactor was shut down in March 1976 and containment of the reactor was completed in 1977. The choice of moderator and fuel was dictated by the undeveloped state of the French nuclear industry at the time, which could not manufacture the corrosion-proof equipment needed for a more advanced unit. The reactor was a pool-type design, with five tons of heavy water moderator surrounded by a two meter-thick concrete wall. The core, immersed in the pool, consisted of 60 aluminum-cased vertical rods containing three tons of uranium oxide pellets, controlled by cadmium rods. The heavy water was purchased from Norsk Hydro. A cooling system was added after the reactor had operated for a time, allowing it to run at a heat release rate of 200 kilowatts. The name Zoé was an acronym, from Zéro de puissance (zero power, that is, very little capacity to produce electricity, which made it easier and faster to build); Oxyde d'uranium (uranium oxide), Eau lourde (heavy water).Pinault, Michel, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Editions Odile Jacob, Paris (2000), pg. 359 The Châtillon site was superseded for later nuclear research by a new site at Saclay. The reactor was also known as EL-1 (Eau Lourde); its successor at Saclay was EL-2. The building that formerly housed Zoé is now an exhibit space, the Museum of the Atom.

From 2009 to 2017 the site underwent regeneration as part of the London Riverside part of the Thames Gateway. The estate was transferred from Havering London Borough Council to Old Ford Housing Association in March 2008Orchard-village.co.uk and redevelopment work started in November 2009.Circleanglia.org Most of the existing housing, including a number of high rise blocks and flats, were demolished. History =Mardyke Estate= The original estate was built by Wates Ltd for Hornchurch Urban District Council on land that was previously the Mardyke Farm. The Mardyke is a minor tributary of the River Thames in Thurrock. The site was built in the 1960s, primarily for workers at the Ford Dagenham automobile construction plant which it borders. It was on the A1304 close to the A13. The estate is not served by any Tube lines, with Dagenham Heathway being the nearest tube station, and Dagenham Dock being the nearest railway station. The 365 bus route had numerous stops within the estate. The estate included a number of maisonettes, low-rise flats, and six high-rise buildings, each 38 m tall and consisting of 13 floors. They were named Chantry House, Dearsley House, Mardyke House, Perry House, Roman House and Templar House. There were 490 housing units for rent and 57 leasehold properties. The estate lacked private space and the juxtapositions of bedsits and maisonettes was not popular. Havering Council transferred the estate to Old Ford Housing Association, which is part of the Circle Anglia Group. =Orchard Village development= Orchard Village is a development that created 555 new homes, comprising 339 general needs, 64 shared ownership and 152 private sale properties. There are also local shops and a new primary care facility. The architect was PRP Architects. The proposal was passed by Havering Council to the Mayor of London's Office on 26 January 2009. It was considered and not refused, but comments were made that it did not comply with the London plan. In particular: London Plan policies on housing, children’s playspace, urban design, access and equal opportunities, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, transport and flood risk. The plan was revised, alterations made and resubmitted. The scheme of works included improvement to an open space adjacent to the estate. It was financed with £31.2m of public money in the form of a grant from the Homes and Communities Agency and administered by the Office of the Mayor Of London (GLA). The scheme was built in three phases. Phase 1 and Phase 2 were mainly social housing, let to the displaced tenants from the original Mardyke Estate. The builde, Willmott Dixon, claimed “the successful completion of phases one and two” and that phase two “was declared best social or affordable new housing development of the year in the Local Authority Building Control Excellence awards” Phase 3 was a development of shared ownership affordable properties. There are 87 units (homes): 29 for affordable rent, 28 shared ownership and 30 for sale. The builder was again Wilmott Dixon. The name Orchard Village reflects the previous use of part of the land as an orchard supplying fruit to Wilkin & Sons. =Construction issues= Since its construction, Orchard Village has been beset with problems of build quality and estate management which have been widely reported in the media, in particular by The Romford Recorder. One of the dozens of homes in Orchard Village supplied without insulation. In late 2015 onwards, residents who purchased affordable homes from Circle Housing, as either freeholders or shared ownership leaseholders, complained of numerous build quality issues including continual leaks, thermal discomfort, electrical faults and high bills. In early 2016 many residents discovered that homes were not insulated and began a process to complain to the authorities involved, Havering Building Control, Circle Housing, the HCA and Mayor of London's office. It was discovered that the Energy Performance Certificates bore no relation to the energy bills from a \\"locked in\\" supplier. On average, home owners are experiencing 3-5 more in costs to the EPCs. Many of the residents are awaiting insulation to be installed into their homes. Gardens are not draining, killing the grass. There has been back flowing of raw sewage into the shower trays and the kitchens. There is a stench from hydrogen sulphide and dangerously high levels of methane, gases that cause migraine and respiratory diseases. It is proposed that these are leaking from the nearby landfill site. Residents have been angered by the HCA and GLA's refusal to examine evidence of resident's exposure to Cat 1 Hazards such as mould and damp, leaving vulnerable individuals, such as disabled children, hospitalised. Circle's poor management has been exposed and widely reported in the press, with residents citing long delays in repairs. Transport The estate is served by the 365 bus. Bus blinds were altered from Mardyke Estate to Orchard Village in 2013. It is operated by Stagecoach East London. Media The former estate was the setting of the 2009 film Fish Tank. The domestic shots in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham were taken on the estate, and the demolition of the tower blocks was postponed to facilitate filming.

The Prekmurje Slovenes speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect and have a common culture.Matija Slavič: Prekmurje, 1921. The Hungarian Slovenes (Porabski Slovenci) and Somogy Slovenes also speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect.Marija Kozar: Etnološki slovar slovencev na Madžarskem, Monošter-Szombathely 1996.  Origins  The Prekmurje Slovenes are descendants of the Slovenes of Lower Pannonia (Slovene Spodnja Panonija, Prekmurje dialect Spoudnja Panonija, ), who were vassals of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century. The Magyars conquered Lower Pannonia in 900, and many of the Slovenes were assimilated. However, the Prekmurje Slovenes in the vicinity of the Mura River maintained their identity.  Middle Ages  The language spoken by the Prekmurje Slovenes, in the absence of contacts with other Slovenes, began to diverge from the standard Slovene (Carniolan) dialect. Nevertheless, contacts were maintained with other Slovene areas such as Lower Styria, Maribor, and Ljutomer. In the Middle Ages the Bishopric of Győr applied the name \\"Tótság\\" to the Slovene parishes in Vas County, and this name was later also applied to the Slovene areas in Zala County. At that time, ethnic Slovene territory extended to Burgenland and Őrség. In the 12th to 13th centuries, a Slovene community lived near Szentgotthárd Abbey.Mukicsné Kozár Mária/Marija Kozar Mukič: Etnološka topografija slovenskega etničnega ozemlja – 20. stoletje; Slovensko Porabje/A szlovén etnikai terület néprajzi topográfiája – 20. század; Szlovénvidék, Ljubljana-Szombathely 1984. 85. pg.  From the Protestant Reformation to the 19th century  In the 16th century Protestantism spread among the Hungarian Slovenes. The Protestant Slovenes were the first to publish in their mother tongue. In the 18th century they already had their own identity, referred to as (Vogrszki szlovenszki) 'Hungarian Slovenes' by István Küzmics in the Predgovor (Foreword) of Nouvi Zákon. The Catholic translator and writer Miklós Küzmics also demonstrated that the Slavic people of Carniola, Styria, Tótság and Somogy are Slovenes too, but Hungarian Slovenes with their own language:Predgovor, Nouvi Zákon 2008. 72. pg. Who will disallow those Slovenes who live between the Mura and the Raba the right to translate these holy books into the language, in which they understand God talking to them through prophets and apostles' letters? God tells them too to read these books in order to get prepared for salvation in the faith of Jesus Christ. But they cannot receive this from Trubar's, Dalmatin's, Francel's, or other translations (versio). The language of our Hungarian Slovenes is different from other languages and unique in its own characteristics. Already in the aforementioned translations there are differences. Therefore, a man had to come who would translate the Bible and bring praise for God and salvation for his nation. God encouraged István Küzmics for this work, a priest from Surd, who translated – with the help of the Holy Spirit and with great diligence – the whole New Testament from Greek into the language you are reading and hearing. With the help (and expenses) of many religious souls, the Holy Bible was printed and given to you for the same reason Küzmics prepared Vöre Krsztsánszke krátki návuk, which was printed in 1754.Predgovor. Nouvi Zákon Stevan Küzmics, Pokrajinska in študijska knjižnica Murska Sobota 2008. Edit: Franc Kuzmič; Translations: in English Peter Lamovec; in Hungarian: Gabriella Bence; in Slovene: Mihael Kuzmič In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries some of the Mura Slovenes moved to Somogy county.  19th century and Magyarization  In the 19th century part of the policy of Magyarization was to raise the national identity-consciousness of the Prekmurje Slovenes, but by means of the Non-Slovene theory (the Wendish question). The theory, which was supported by Hungarians, was that the Wends (Prekmurje Slovenes) are a \\"Slavic-Magyar people\\", and in the long run the support for the Prekmurje dialect and culture is unnecessary as these \\"Slavic-Magyars\\" would become entirely Magyarized.  1918–1991  By the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, two-thirds of the Slovene population of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Catholic Slovene politicians from Prekmurje, such as József Klekl, welcomed the Treaty. Later Klekl became disappointed with the lack of democracy in the new state, the constraints on the use of the Slovene language, and the failure to implement land reform. As a result, he became an advocate for the Slovene language and Slovene national identity. An opposite position was taken by another Prekmurje politician, Miško Kranjec, who later became a member of Slovene Communist Party. After 1945 the Yugoslav government tried to suppress József Klekl's ideas. In Hungary too not only the Prekmurje Slovene identity was suppressed, but Slovene national identity in general. = The theories of Sándor Mikola = After World War I the \\"Wendish-Celtic\\" and \\"Wendish-Magyar\\" theories were elaborated by Sándor Mikola. These were based on a falsification of the history of Prekmurje. Slovene sources have said that Mikola claimed that the Prekmurje Slovenes (Wends) are a separate nation, but in fact Mikola denied that there is such a thing as a Prekmurje Slovene identity. In his opinion the Prekmurje Slovenes are a Hungarian group and they \\"will become Hungarians.\\" = The Mura Republic and Slovenska krajina = In 1918 Klekl sought to establish an autonomous territory, the \\"Slovenska krajina\\" (or Slovene March) within Hungary.Tengely Adrienn: Az egyházak és a nemzetiségi kérdés 1918-ban However, there was little support in Ljubljana for this idea and he later proposed that the Slovene March become an independent state, confederated with Yugoslavia. Later Klekl regretted, that the idea of the Slovene krajina was not pursued. On 29 May 1919 Vilmos Tkálecz declared the Mura Republic (Murska republika, Respublika Mürska)in Murska Sobota, but this had little impact as well.  Since 1991  After 1991 the writer Feri LainščekFeri Lainšček: V resnici zelo malo pišem (siol.net) Feri Lainšček, pisatelj in pesnik (mladina.si) and others\\"Zame prekmurščina ni narečje, temveč jezik\\" (vecer.com) championed the concept of a Prekmurje Slovene identityÁbrahám Barna: Magyar-németek, tótok, szlovjákok, magyar oroszok, vendek – népnév és identitás a 19. században (panonskoslovenska identiteta).Dane podatke o življenju in delu Ferija Lainščka uredi v smiselno besedilo Another advocate of a Prekmurje Slovene identity, Evald Flisar, has written: The homeland regards Prekmurje not as a part of Slovenia but something peculiar within its borders… It is unthinkable for two people from Prekmurje to speak with each other in anything but the Prekmurje dialect. I used to meet the former President of the Republic Milan Kučan at public events quite often. We always spoke the local dialect, it would have felt odd to use standard Slovenian, since he is from Prekmurje too. Others joked about us, asking why are we so secretive. When I met a compatriot in Australia, Africa or America, we immediately started to talk in our own language.

He is the father of Luciana Mello and Jair Oliveira, who also followed in his footsteps and became musicians. Biography Born in Igarapava, Rodrigues grew up in Nova Europa, a city in the interior of the state of São Paulo, where he lived until 1954. Thereafter he moved with his family to São Carlos, where he started his musical career, as the city had the best nightlife in the region. His career began when he crooned in São Carlos during the mid-to-late-1950s. He also participated in various functions with Radio São Carlos. In 1958, Jair joined the São Carlos military reserve. At the start of the 1960s, he gained popularity in the state capital as a singer on various television programs for new musical talent. In 1965, he and Elis Regina successfully sang together on \\"O Fino da Bossa\\", a television program on TV Record. In 1966 Jair sang at the \\"Record Festival\\" with the song \\"Disparada\\" by Geraldo Vandré and Théo de Barros, this time in conjunction with Quarteto Novo. Known for singing sambas, Jair surprised the audience with a beautiful interpretation of the song. \\"Disparada\\" and Chico Buarque's \\"Banda\\", sung by Nara Leao, were the favorites. The competition ended in a draw. From that moment on, his career took off and his talent experienced decades of success. Jair released an album a year and performed hits such as O Menino da Porteira, Boi da Cara Preta and Majestade o Sabiá. He has toured Europe, the United States and Japan. In 1971, he recorded the samba-enredo Festa para um Rei Negro for GRES Acadêmicos do Salgueiro from Rio de Janeiro.

A German art dealer, Hans Meyer, commissioned the first painting, of a 300SL coupe, to celebrate the 1986 centenary of the invention of the motor car. When Mercedes-Benz saw the result, it commissioned the entire series, which was to track the evolution of its designs from the Benz Patent-Motorwagen 1885, Daimler Motor Carriage (1886), and Mercedes 35 hp (1901), to the Mercedes-Benz W125, and the Mercedes-Benz C111. Now part of Mercedes-Benz's corporate art collection, Cars was unfinished at the time of Warhol's death in 1987. Warhol completed 36 silkscreen prints and 13 drawings of eight Mercedes models before his death. Warhol had planned to cover 20 models in 80 pieces. The series was based on photographs of cars, and were the first non-American designed objects that Warhol had portrayed in his work. Cars has been exhibited just twice in its entirety in public: in Tübingen in 1988, and at the Albertina, Vienna from 22 January–16 May 2010. Half of the series was shown in Milton Keynes in September 2001. Cars was Warhol's second automotive art project. In 1979 Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar BMW M1 for the fourth installment in the BMW Art Car Project. Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes painting the entire car. Warhol's work for Mercedes-Benz and his similar commissions for Perrier have been criticized as \\"undistinguished glitz\\", with critics lamenting Warhol's \\"passionate avarice\\", accusing him of crossing the line into advertisements for their subjects.

History Forest Range was settled by timber sawyers, cutting stringybark trees for timber and charcoal. In 1854 there was a minor gold rush with a larger gold rush in the 1880s. Gold-seekers took over 6000 ounces of gold. Timber-cutting gave way to fruit and vegetable farming as land was cleared. Forest Range initially comprised the whole district including Lenswood, until 1917 when Lenswood was proclaimed. Initially land clearing (and gold) formed the major industries, but this soon gave way to farming. Farming in those times was mixed, with fruit and vegetables farmed for local or Adelaide use. In the 20th century farming became more specialised and apples, pears and cherries became the main industries. The Forest Range Fruitgrowers' Co- Operative Society was one of the main sites of apple packing and storage until it was absorbed by the nearby Lenswood Cold Store in the 1950s. Forest Range had a number of businesses and community buildings, but over time, these have all disappeared. These included hotels, timber sawing mills, shops, and churches. The Forest Range Hall (at the oval) and the Forest Range Post Office remain the last community buildings, however there are numerous orchard sheds and private cold stores.

In particular, the historic Manufacture of La Chaux-de- Fonds, one of the last in the world, today boasts 110 haute horlogerie movements and 80 patents.François Chaille, Girard-Perregaux, p. 120-123 Career Graduated in architecture at the University of Turin in 1975, Gino Macaluso began his long career in the world of watchmaking in Italy, joining the Italian distributor company of SSIH, now the Swatch Group. In 1982, in Turin, he founded Tradema, one of the largest watch distribution companies in Italy which includes the Blancpain, Breitling and Hamilton brands. In 1987 he became the official agent of Girard-Perregaux for the Italian market and, in 1989, he joined the Manufacturing board of directors.

The only Italian entrepreneur to be considered among the most authoritative in the international watch and luxury watch market, in 1998 he received the Gaïa Prize for the Esprit d'Entreprise, the most prestigious recognition in the Swiss watch world, awarded since 1993 by the Musée International d'Horlogerie to those personalities who made watchmaking and its art known through their activities. In spring 2009, after the strategic agreement with the Kering Group, which belongs to the French businessman Francois-Henri Pinault, he joined the Gucci Group Management Committee with responsibility for the watch and jewelry sector and the Conseil de Surveillance of Boucheron, one of the greatest jewelers in the world. He was nominated three times – in 1999, 2001 and 2004 – president of the Association Interprofessionelle de la Haute Horologerie (AIHH). He was vice-president of the Italian-Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Zurich and advisor in the Chamber of Commerce of Neuchâtel.

In 1987 he joined Club Italia, a non-profit cultural sports association, established to enhance the historical heritage of the Italian classic car, of which he has been president for almost two decades. In 1997 he joined the ACI-CSAI (Automobile Club of Italy-Italian Automobile Sports Commission); in 2001 he was elected president: he will be honorary president until his death. While he was dedicating himself to promoting the cultural, social, aesthetic and historical values of the automobile, he decided to restore rally cars dating back to the golden age of the specialty: from here began a collection that is still today one among the most relevant in this sector. In 2000 he founded a team that aimed to compete in the Junior World Championship with Italian colors: the R&D; Motorsport, which brought Andrea Dallavilla driving a Fiat Punto Rally Super 1600 to win the title of second world champion in the season 2001 of the JWRC. In 2005, Gino Macaluso was elected President of the International Karting Commission, organ of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), and became the representative of Italy on the World Council of the same. Fondazione Gino Macaluso per l'Auto Storica In 2018, Gino Macaluso's family established a foundation that bears his name. Its purpose is to make Gino's dream come true: he considered the car \\"the most intense expression of creativity of the twentieth century\\". For this purpose and thanks to the collection that belonged to Gino, the foundation organizes, promotes and participates in events, competitions, rallies, exhibitions, fairs, seminars, conferences, workshops related to historic cars, motorsport and its protagonists. At the same time, it promotes studies, restorations and publications about historic cars. Distinctions In 2008, Gino Macaluso was appointed a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In 2009, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour.

Historiographical studies of the May Revolution started in the second half of the 19th century in Argentina and have extended to modern day. All historiographical perspectives agree in considering the May Revolution as the turning point that gave birth to the modern nation of Argentina, and that the Revolution was unavoidable in 1810. The main topics of disagreement between Argentine historians are the specific weight of the diverse causes of the May Revolution, who were the leaders of it among the different involved parties, whenever there was popular support for it or not, and whenever the loyalty to the captive Spanish king Ferdinand VII was real or an elaborate masquerade to conceal pro-independence purposes. Factual concerns Historians do not face many doubts or unknown details. The most important details were properly recorded at the time, and made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, the different historical views on the topic differ on interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events rather than the accuracy of the depiction of the event themselves. The modern historical vision of the revolutionary events do not differ significantly from the contemporary ones. The only factual topics that remain unconfirmed are the quotes and speeches made at the Open Cabildo or the audience with Cisneros, as the quotes kept do not come from transcriptions or recordings but from memories wrote years later or from oral tradition. Another disputed topic is the existence or not of the Operations plan, a secret document allegedly written by Mariano Moreno and setting harsh way for the Primera Junta to achieve its goals. Supporters of it consider that it is coherent with the actions taken by the Junta, like the execution of Santiago de Liniers, while detractors consider it a literary forgery made by an enemy of the Revolution in order to harm its public image in Europe. It is a topic of discussion which were the reasons to create a Junta with Cisneros, instead of following the results of the open cabildo in the first place. Historian Diego Abad de Santillán considers that the formula responded to Benito Lue y Riega's proposal of keeping the Viceroy in power along with partners or attachments, even though it was defeated at the open cabildo vote. Abad de Santillán argues that this formula made the lobbyists believe they could contain the growing threat of revolution.Abad de Santillán, p. 410 Félix Luna, on the other hand, considers that it was an effort to avoid further conflicts, by choosing a middle ground solution, conceding something to all involved parties. Cisneros would remain in office, but sharing the power with the criollos.Luna, Independencia..., p. 34 It is also unclear which person or group decided the members of the Primera Junta. Saavedra claims in his memoirs, as do liberal historians like Vicente Fidel López, that it was exclusively a product of the popular initiative.Scenna, p. 39 Others, such as historian Félix Luna, feel the proposal shows such a level of balance among the relevant political and ideological parties involved that it can't be considered as merely the result of an improvised popular initiative.Luna, Independencia..., p. 39 The proposed President, Saavedra, made a decisive intervention in the revolution and had prestige among all parties involved. Juan José Paso, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, and Mariano Moreno were lawyers influenced by the Age of Enlightenment, and the first three were former supporters of the Carlotist project. Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu were peninsulars involved in commercial activities of some importance. Both of them were supporters of Martín de Álzaga, as was Moreno. Miguel de Azcuénaga was a military man with contacts in high society, and the priest Manuel Alberti represented the aspirations of the lower clergy. Miguel Angel Scenna points out in his book Las brevas maduras that \\"such balance could not have been the result of chance, or from influences from outside the local context, but of a compromise of the parties involved\\". Both authors deny the theory that the composition of the Junta may have been suggested by the British; there was no time for that, and there were no British people in Buenos Aires important enough to influence such matters.Luna, Independencia..., p. 40 Finally, the idea of the junta being chosen by the military is unlikely; despite the presence of Saavedra as president of the junta, it wasn't a military Junta; the majority of its members were civilians. Even more, it included Mariano Moreno, whose enmity with Saavedra dated from the failed mutiny of 1809.Scenna, p. 44-45 Historiography The first people who wrote about the Revolution were most of the protagonists themselves of it, writing memories, biographies or diaries. However, their works were motivated by other purposes than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or manifest their support or rejection for public figures or ideas of the time.Gelman, p. 32 For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano to use it as propaganda for the Revolution in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself before his sons. Some points shared between those writings are the mentions to the British Invasions as a clear antecedent, the pride about the nonviolent nature of the Revolution at its first stages, the rejection to the later developments of the Argentine Civil War, and the description of the events as the recovery of the sovereignty delegated to the kKing.Gelman, p. 34 The first remarkable historiographical school of interpretation of the history of Argentina was founded by Bartolomé Mitre, in his book Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism, the conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and the attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the leadership of the caudillos. Mitre introduced the idea that the nation of Argentina existed prior to 1810, and that it was subjugated up to that point by the Spanish authorities.Gelman, p. 15 Meanwhile, Esteban Echeverría epitomized the ideals of May in the concepts of progress and democracy. In the future, these concepts would be the axis around which revisionist history would differ from the canonical history in reference to the events of May. The canonical version claimed progress and justify the abandonment or delay the realization of democratic ideals in order not to risk the economic prosperity of society arguing that even then was not able to properly take advantage of political freedom. This situation was known as the establishment of the \\"Possible Republic.\\" Mitre and Echeverría were part of the '37 Generation, a group of romantic authors born during the revolution itself and formed in the local context generated after it. Those authors did not work purely in intellectual fields, but took instead active part in the political events of their time, and strongly opposed the governor Juan Manuel de Rosas. They were closer to the unitarians than to the federalists, but were not fully unitarians either: they thought that it wasn't enough to apply directly the new ideas generated in Europe or the United States, but instead to adapt them to the local contexts of the Río de la Plata.Gelman, p. 132 They choose the May Revolution as the point to mark the birth of the nation because of their rejection to the Spanish or aboriginal cultures.Gelman, p. 133 The last years of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were marked in Argentina by a growing industrialization process and the arrival of huge numbers of European immigrants. Historiographical studies were increased by the \\"New Historical school\\", in order to forge a \\"national identity\\", and the May Revolution had great prominence. There were discussions about the level of influence that the many causes of the May Revolution actually had, or whose interventions were the most decisive, but two points shared by all historians were to consider the May Revolution as the birth of Argentina, and to consider it an inevitable consequence of the causes that led to it (meaning, the chance of the May Revolution never taking place is not considered a feasible possibility by historians).Gelman, p. 16-17 There was also a subtle change: the scope of the revolution as a subject of study originally started with the events of May 1810 in Buenos Aires and kept going on for decades. They were later split, and the name \\"May Revolution\\" made reference only to events that led to the removal of Cisneros and the creation of the Primera Junta.Gelman, p. 17-18 A new element added by those historians was to consider, either to support or reject the idea, whenever there was an active and strong popular support for the Revolution, instead of explaining it solely around the actions of a limited number of enlightened men.Gelman, p. 193 Nevertheless, they kept the previous approaches for the most part.Gelman, p. 191 The academic consensus of the end of the 19th century began to be questioned by the time of the World Wars, when liberalism lost its former hegemony and fascism and left- wing ideologies became important. Liberalism attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective, though Ricardo Levene and the National Academy of History.Gelman, p. 256 This school of thought kept most of the viewpoints of Mitre. Left-wing authors opposed it with a revisionist production, based in nationalism and anti-imperialism. However, revisionists would work mainly with the historiography of Juan Manuel de Rosas, Justo José de Urquiza, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento or Mitre himself, without working much with the War of Independence, and in fact José de San Martín was equally supported by both genres.Gelman, p.257 Nevertheless, they deemphasized the idea of a conflict between criollos and peninsulars, and described it instead as a conflict between liberalism and absolutism. The fascist author Hugo Wast would describe the Revolution as a military coup carried out by military leaders, and where the population was completely uninvolved. The 150º anniversary of the May Revolution found the liberal and revisionist historiographies opposing each other more strongly. The senator from Corrientes J. Aníbal Dávila promoted the republication of old documents so that \\"the intentions of the antihistory of Argentina does not confuse the current generations, the masses and the youth with misleading slogans\\".Gelman, p. 309 José María Rosa would react by stating that the Revolution was carried out by the masses and that those were shadowed by other figures by liberal historians seeking to falsify history.Gelman, p. 312 The perspectives of Rosa found great acceptance in society and are currently part of the Argentine historic common sense. By the 1970 decade authors like Tulio Halperin Donghi or José Carlos Chiaramonte attempted to provide a less absolute perspective about the May Revolution, by making detailed analysis of the local and international contexts and the possible options that the revolutionaries had at their disposal, with the Revolution being one option among many others.Gelman, p. 19 Disputes =Revolutionary purposes= The May Revolution declared loyalty to Ferdinand VII of Spain. The government created on May 25 was pronounced loyal to the deposed Spanish king Ferdinand VII, but historians do not agree on whenever such loyalty was genuine or not. Since Mitre, many historians consider that such loyalty was merely a political deception to gain factual autonomy. The Primera Junta did not pledged allegiance to the Regency Counsel of Spain and the Indies, an agency of the Spanish monarchy still in operation, and in 1810 the possibility that Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated and Ferdinand returned to the throne (which would finally happened on December 11, 1813 with the signing of the Treaty of Valençay) still seemed remote and unlikely. The purpose of the deception would have been to gain time to strengthen the position of the patriotic cause, avoiding the reactions that may have led by a revolution, on the grounds that monarchical authority was still respected and that no revolution took place. The ruse is known as the \\"Mask of Ferdinand VII\\" and would have been upheld by the Primera Junta, the Junta Grande, and the First and Second Triumvirates. The Assembly of Year XIII was intended to declare independency, but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members; however, it suppressed mentions to Ferdinand VII from official documents. The supreme directors held an ambivalent attitude until the declaration of independence of 1816. For Britain the change was favorable, as it facilitated trade with the cities of the area without seeing it hampered by the monopoly that Spain maintained over their colonies. However, Britain prioritized the war in Europe against France, allied with the Spanish power sector that had not yet been submitted, and could not appear to support American independentist movements or allow military attention of Spain being divided into two different fronts. Consequently, they pushed for independence demonstrations not being made explicit. This pressure was exerted by Lord Strangford, the British ambassador at the court of Rio de Janeiro, expressing support to the Junta, but conditioned \\"...if the behavior is consistent and that Capital retained on behalf of Mr. Dn. Fernando VII and his legitimate successors.\\" However, the following conflicts between Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Artigas led to internal conflicts in the British front, between Strangford and the Portuguese regent John VI of Portugal. Since Juan Bautista Alberdi, later historians such as Norberto Galasso, Luis Romero or José Carlos Chiaramonte held in doubt the interpretation made by Mitre, and designed a different one. Alberdi thought that \\"The Argentine revolution is a chapter of the Hispanoamerican revolution, which is such of the Spanish one, and this, as well, of the European revolution.\\" They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between the new libertarian ideas and absolutism, without the intention to cut the relation with Spain, but to reformulate it. Thus, it would have the characteristics of a civil war instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of José de San Martín: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Martín had lived so far most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Martín talked about the enemies, he called them \\"royalists\\" or \\"Goths\\", but never \\"Spanish\\". According to those historians, the Spanish revolution against absolutism got mixed with the Peninsular War. Charles IV was seen as an absolutist king, and by standing against his father many Spanish got the wrong understanding that Ferdinand VII sympathized with the new enlighten ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of Ferdinand VII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution or the one in Chile) would have been seeking to replace the absolutist power with others made under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals themselves of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected by those people. However, those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack, which promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping the old order of maintaining the new one. This situation would have changed with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, as he restored absolutism and persecuted the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For the people in South America, the idea of remaining as part of the Spanish Empire, but with a new relation with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point would have been a return to absolutism, or independentism. Documents Cornelio Saavedra spoke about the issue privately with Juan José Viamonte in a letter from 27 June 1811, addressing topics such as a known display of independentism by Máximo de Zamudio. This letter was subsequently rescued. In it, he explicitly mentioned the situation as a deception to avoid England from declaring war on them. On the other hand, the Congress of Tucuman issued a manifest in 1817, more than a year after the declaration of independence. It detailed abuses made by the Spanish, and former chances for separatism that were not used. Of course, once the independence was declared openly, there would not have been any further need for keeping a masquerade of submission. In the specific case of the May Revolution, it says: Groups involved The groups who supported or carried out the revolution were not completely homogeneous in their purpose, and several had disparate interests together. The progressive Criollos and young people, represented on the Junta by Moreno, Castelli, Belgrano and Paso, aspired to far-reaching political, economic and social reforms. Moreover, the military and bureaucrats, whose views were carried forward by Saavedra, simply wanted a renewal of office holders, aspiring to remove the Spanish from the exclusive use of power, but inheriting their privileges and powers. The merchants and landlords subordinated the political issues to the economic decisions, particularly with respect to the opening or not of trade with England. Finally, some groups shuffled possibilities to replace the authority of the Regency Council with that of Charlotte of Portugal or the British crown, but such projects have had limited impact. These groups worked together for the common goal of expelling Cisneros from power, but after the Primera Junta was settled they began to express their internal differences. No religious factors were involved in the revolution: all the revolutionaries and royalists agreed to support Catholicism. Still, most church leaders opposed the revolution. In Upper Peru the royalists and religious authorities sought to equate the revolutionaries with heretics, but the revolutionary leaders always promoted conciliatory policies in the religious aspects. For instance, Mariano Moreno translated The Social Contract to Spanish, but left aside the chapters that criticized religion. The priests and monks, however, were divided geographically: the provinces \\"from below\\" were loyal to the revolution, while those of Upper Peru preferred to remain loyal to the monarchy.
