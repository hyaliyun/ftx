Banks. The story is an early venture into the \\"complex and unusual and very distant\\" setting of the Culture, which Banks would further develop through various full length novels, stories, and his essay \\"A Few Notes on the Culture\\". \\"'A Gift from the Culture' is one of Banks' few short stories, and of them, one of the even fewer that give glimpses of the Culture. In this story written more than a decade before the real-world War on Terror, Banks' protagonist is coerced into committing mass murder, seeming a bit uncomfortably like Luke Skywalker as Mohammed Atta.\\" (p. 298, TSOR)Hartwell, David G., and Kathryn Cramer. The Space Opera Renaissance. New York: Orb Books, 2007.Iain M. Banks website http://www.iain-banks.net/ It was re-published in the Banks anthology, The State of the Art (1991, ). Characters *Wrobik Sennkil: the protagonist of the story. \\"Vreccile citizen...male, prime race, aged thirty, part-time freelance journalist... and full-time gambler.\\" Wrobik, however, is also an alien, a Culture expatriate, \\"Bahlln-Euchersa Wrobich Vress Schennil dam Flaysse...born female, species mix too complicated to remember, aged sixty- eight, standard, and one time member of the Contact section.... and a renegade.\\" *Kaddus and Cruizell: two large Vreccile flunkies, to whom Wrobik is in arrears. *Maust: Vreccile, a dancer in one of the Low City’s gay clubs, and Wrobik’s boyfriend. Plot summary The story is set in Vreccis Low City, within the Vreccile Economic Community (VEC). From the opening passages, it could easily unfold as a classic noir tale: A rainy night outside a gambling club, Kaddus and Cruizell confront the reluctant but indebted Wrobik with a dead-end deal. In a couple of days a starship carrying the planet’s Admiral will be returning, and Wrobik is to shoot it down, over the city, using a small pistol which they give him to use. It is only when the gun is placed in his hands, does it become clear that this is another reality: it \\"comes to life,\\" lights blinking, small screen flickering. The pistol will function only for those biologically of the Culture, and is the only weapon able to penetrate the starship’s defenses, making the alien Wrobik the perfect candidate for the job. Eight years ago Wrobik left the high-minded and highly advanced Culture for the unabashedly corrupt world of the VEC. He describes the Culture as a sterile, self-assured communist-bloc Utopia, a powerful society with an agenda of hypocritical moral imperialism, backed by Special Circumstances -- \\"Dirty Tricks in other words.\\" Almost in the background, the xenophobic VEC is waging \\"distant wars against aliens, outworlders, subhumans;\\" civilian deaths going unnoted in the news reports. There have been demonstrations, one of which continues to give Wrobik nightmares — visions of the human military-machine charging forward. There is also the ‘radical’ organization, considered ‘terrorists’ by most, called \\"Bright Path,\\" which apparently supplied the gangsters with the rare gun. Wrobik would be living in the besieged Outworlder’s Quarters himself, but nobody besides Maust, he thought, knew of his alien identity. While still in the Culture, Wrobik, then Bahlln-Euchersa (etc.), went through a process of \\"regendering,\\" changing sex (physically), from female to male. Despite her hopes, her (mental) gender and sexual orientation did not morph along with her body. Though still a woman in his own mind, since living in the VEC, Wrobik has accepted the identity that society has bestowed upon him: that of a homosexual male, and has found happiness with Maust. \\"I would not be a woman in this society,\\" he states, implying that, despite the homophobic society which is shown, this perhaps is the better option. Wrobik attempts to flee the VEC, in order to avoid his task, which would turn him into not only the murderer of a high official, but possibly hundreds of civilians. Overheard news that an ambassador from the Culture is to be on the targeted starship as well further dissuades him, and also brings up questions about the true purpose of the attack. Before Wrobik can skip town (or planet), though, Kaddus and Cruizell get hold of Maust and use him as leverage. Wrobik is forced to stay and carry out his assignment in order to assure his safety. The story ends with Wrobik completing his mission, the ship fallen and the distant city ablaze with the fire from the explosions. He never wanted to hurt anyone, but maybe now he is the terrorist. We do not know his fate; he pockets the gun, and \\"[races] down to join all the other poor folk on the run.\\" Film adaptation In 2009, plans were announced for a film adaptation by Mass Productions, jointly owned by Mike Downey and Sam Taylor of Film and Music Entertainment together with director Dominic Murphy,Dominic Murphy directed White Lightnin' (2009) who was to be co-writing the screenplay with Shane Smith.

History On 13 January 1950, four sisters arrived in Jhelum, one of the smallest cities in Pakistan. They laid the foundation of the Presentation Convent School. There were two big compounds with mud huts on both, and Jada Road lay between them. The school was opened in May. By 1962, Sr. Anne Broderick had, with the help of contractor Mohammad Sharif Bhatti, replaced all the mud huts with the new building. By degrees, other extensions were made to provide the school the city has today. Most of their students (Christians) have decided to follow in the footsteps of Nano Nagle as Presentation Sisters. The Presentation story in Pakistan began in 1895 in Rawalpindi, which was then the part of the subcontinent, when Mother Ignatius McDermott, Sr. Xavier Lonergan and Sr. Evangelist Coatsworth arrived from Madras. The school opened on 1 October with three sisters and three pupils. As the years passed, many Irish girls came to join the sisters.The News October 11, 2020 On 8 September 1895, the first Presentation Convent School in the Punjab was opened by three Irish sisters. Today in Pakistan there are Presentation schools catering for the educational needs of around 13,000 children in Urdu- and English-medium schools. Presentation schools are Rawalpindi, Murree, Peshawar, Sargodha, Khushab Distt., Wah, Risalpur, Mingora (Swat) and Sindh. In 2009, 1700 students were enrolled in the school. The principal was Sr. Riffat Sadiq and is Sr. Shameem now. Though the Jhelum city has many excellent schools, the Convent is considered the best institution. The school is very well organized, and the discipline of this school is acknowledged everywhere in the country. Jhelum School There are separate campuses for boys and girls. This is primarily known as a girls' school. The boy's section has only five classes, from 1 to 5. In the girl's section, classes start from Kindergarten to 10th. Each class is further divided into three sections, A, B, and C. The students are divided into four houses: * Mother Teresa * Fatimah Jinnah * Florence Nightingale * Nano Nagle In 2009, 1700 students were enrolled in the school. The principal was Sr. Riffat Sadiq. On 13 January 2012, the school celebrated its 62nd anniversary. In 2013, Sr Shameem became the new principal. Its most famous alumnus is Lieutenant General Masood Aslam, Sitara-i-Jurat, Colonel Commandant of the Punjab Regiment of the Pakistan Army.Dawn 15 April 2007 References Category:Catholic secondary schools in Pakistan Category:Catholic schools in Pakistan Category:High schools in Pakistan Category:Catholic Church in Pakistan Category:Girls' schools in Pakistan Category:Education in Jhelum Category:Presentation Sisters schools Category:1895 establishments in India Category:Pakistani school stubs ","title":"Presentation Convent School, Jhelum"},{"id":"27094692","text":"Nebularia thachi is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitridae, the miters or miter snails.

History In 1996 Erik Cameron and his brother Chris formed the band Total Eclipse. After a search for musicians who shared their passion, they met drummer Ramon Ochoa in 1998. As a teenager, Ramon had already swung the stick for several local acts. A short time later experienced bass player Owen Hart joined the band. The line-up was completed in January 1999 by singer Andy Dracons Giardina - also in Pandemic, and now the only original member from Total Eclipse's old line-up - who had already made a name for himself in his native Italy before moving to the United States to finish his academic studies and advance his musical career. The chemistry between the Cameron brothers and the rest of the band was just right and within a year they had enough material for a demo. The Total Eclipse Guardians of Metal EP was released internationally in 1999. Encouraged by the demo's success, Total Eclipse contacted famous German producer Uwe Lulis and before long the band had signed a deal with Limb Music; the album Ashes of Eden was released worldwide to much critical acclaim. Legendary Piet Sielck was also involved in the mixing and production of the album. In 2004, the original line-up disintegrated following a decision made by the Cameron Brothers to pursue a different musical direction. After parting ways with Limb Music, and having legally acquired the name of the band, Giardina decided to find another label to release their new second album, Spellcaster, also produced by Uwe Lulis, recorded in the Bay Area and somewhere near the Black Forest in Germany, then remastered in 2007/08 in San Francisco. The music is an expansion of the sound of the Ashes of Eden album and the Guardians of Metal demo. In October 2007, Andy Dracons Giardina decided to resurrect Total Eclipse after the band's four-year hiatus from the scene, and simultaneously release the long-awaited second LP Spellcaster. After many hardships, including a brief stint with a reformed line-up that didn't quite work out, the quest to fulfill the reincarnation of Total Eclipse continued and, in 2008, the band found Brian Davy as the new drummer for the second line-up. In March 2009 Total Eclipse entered Faultline Studios in San Francisco to begin the recording of the third LP with the new line-up. The title for the new album is Kulkukan and has been recently released worldwide independently. This work represents yet another phase in the evolution of style and sound of the band. With the album recording complete, the band is setting up a full lineup, and will be planning subsequent touring to support the release. In 2010, Total Eclipse joined world-famous metal band, IMAGIKA on a US tour which ran for several weeks, and was booked by Distilled Entertainment. In July 2013, Total Eclipse was rejoined by guitarist Dan Gorman, and the band is now rehearsing material and setting plans to move forward.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 19. Built in 1878, it is a three-story brick building with a modified rectangular floor plan and a sloping roofline. From Lima's earliest years, the Union Block's site on the southeastern corner of today's Public Square was a leading commercial site. Preceding it was Lima's first hotel, built by the second white man to settle in Lima. The Union Block was constructed during a booming period in Lima's history. As the influence of railroading in Lima expanded during the 1870s, the city itself grew significantly; the Union Block was one of several major commercial buildings erected on Public Square during this period.Hopkins, Phyllis G. '. National Park Service, 1980-05-15. Accessed 2010-04-24. The block's architecture is an example of a commercial variant of the Victorian style. Among its most prominent exterior details are ornate lintels and stone trim, while the interior features iron posts on the first floor and a staircase of cast iron. Each bay features a cluster of windows, most of which are composed of two or three windows. In 1982, the Union Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its well-preserved architecture. Sixteen other Lima buildings were listed on the National Register at the same time; all were part of the Lima Multiple Resource Area, a collection of architecturally-significant buildings in and around the city's downtown. Two other buildings on Public Square were included in this collection: the Neal Clothing Building, completed before the Civil War, and the early 20th-century First National Bank and Trust Building.

Pleioptygma is the type genus of the family Pleioptygmatidae and it is the sole genus in the family Pleioptygmatidae. de Bruyne R. H. (2004). Encyklopedie ulit a lastur. Rebo Productions, 336 pp., , page 191.  Etymology  The generic name Pleioptygma is composed from the Greek word \\"pleios\\", which means \\"full\\" and from the Greek word \\"ptygma\\", which means \\"fold\\". This is a reference to the numerous folds on the columella of the shell.  Description  In the genus Pleioptygma, the shell is medium to large in size. The shell has mainly spiral sculpture. The type description of the genus Pleioptygma by Timothy Abbott Conrad (1863) reads as follows: Although the shell of these gastropods looks similar to that of mitrids (family Mitridae), they are unrelated enough to require their own family. The family Pleioptygmatidae has been defined based on the anatomy of the only extant species Pleioptygma helenae: The foot is relatively large in comparion to the size of the shell. Also the snout is relatively large. The foregut (of the digestive system) is different from other families within the Muricoidea. The proboscis is introvert, with a proboscis bulb that has an extreme thick wall. The proboscis bulb is connected directly to the buccal mass. There is no epiproboscis.

It praised the development of the welfare state as challenging capitalism and declared its opposition to Bolshevik communism. It declared that socialism was an international movement that was plural in nature that required different approaches in different circumstances. However, the Declaration stated that true socialism could only be achieved through democracy. According to the Declaration, the economic goals of socialism include full employment, the welfare state and achievement of public ownership through a variety of means, including nationalization, creation of cooperatives to counter capitalist private enterprise and/or securing rights for trade unions. The Declaration stated that economic and social planning did not necessarily have to be achieved in a centralized form, but it could also be achieved in decentralized forms.

In 1955 he won the Prix de Rome for composition. He taught for more than 30 years on the faculty of the University of Michigan where he founded and directed the school's electronic music studio. Upon his retirement he was made a professor emeritus. Early life Born in Grand Island, Nebraska, Wilson grew up in Lincoln. His father was an amateur flutist and clarinetist and his mother was a pianist who had earned money for his family accompanying silent films during the Great Depression. His parents often played duets together at home and took Wilson to local concerts by ensembles like the Lincoln Symphony. He also received music lessons from them. Although this exposure instilled a love for music within Wilson, the nervousness of public performance led to his eventual refusal to pursue further musical studies in his childhood. He later took piano lessons intermittently during his teenage years. His grandfather was a doctor in the small town of Rushville, Nebraska located near the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and thus the family had opportunities during visits to interact with the local Sioux community. This was the beginning of Wilson's lifelong fascination with the art, history and languages of the Sioux, Hopi and Navaho cultures. As a boy, Wilson developed an interest in photography and at the age of 12 he began working for the Lincoln regional office of the Natural Resources Conservation Service as a photo lab technician. At the age of 13 his family moved to Denver, Colorado where he worked as a lab technician for a portrait photographer while attending high school. At the age of 18 he became a radio operator gunner in the United States Air Force for a short time before being reassigned to the teaching staff at the Air Force Photographic School at Lowery Field. He became burned out on the business of photography while working there, coming to the realization that his real passion was music. Education In 1947 Wilson entered the music program at the University of Michigan (UM) through funds provided by the G.I. Bill. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Music, a Master of Music, and a Doctor of Music, all in music composition, from the UM. Among his teachers as the UM were Percy Price, Homer Keller, and Ross Lee Finney. In 1953 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship which enabled him to pursue studies in Belgium and France. He notably studied with Jean Absil at the Brussels Conservatory and with Nadia Boulanger in both Paris and at the Fontainebleau Schools. He was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1955 which further extended his studies in Europe through 1958. During that time he pursued studies in Italy in electronic music. He later pursued further studies in that field with Milton Babbitt, Mario Davidovsky, Otto Luening, and Vladimir Ussachevsky at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Career Wilson joined the music composition faculty of the University of Michigan in 1959 while a doctoral student at the school. He had already taught undergraduate courses in music theory at the UM as a teaching fellow while working on his master's degree. In 1962 he founded the UM's electronic music studio through funds provided by the Rackham Graduate School, directing the studio for the next 30 years. He patterned the studio after the Columbia- Princeton Electronic Music Center. In 1992 Wilson produced a concert in honor of the studio with works from many of the University's composition students at the time, including Evan Chambers, Leslie Hogan, Michael Angell and others. He was involved in Ann Arbor's experimental music and performance scene from the 1960s, participating in large installation pieces which involved quadrophonic music in downtown parking structures, or filling the halls of the University of Michigan Music School with inflatable plastic hallways, complete with electro-acoustic music piped in. For many years he drove about town in a green VW bug, which he occasionally drove through the center of the (pedestrian) Diag. His students include John Burke, Katt Hernandez, George Crumb, Andrew Paul MacDonald, Evan Chambers, Frank Ticheli, and Gérard Pape.

History =Early Beginnings in French Polynesia= The first Adventist missionaries to Tahiti were the Gates, Read, and Tay families, who arrived on the missionary boat, Pitcairn, on 25 December 1890. They and their successors for nearly fifty years were English- speaking. Paul Deane, a Protestant pastor, and his wife were the first converts. They were baptised in 1893 and in the following year they went to the island of Raiatea, 180 km north-west of Tahiti, to assist Benjamin J Cady (from USA), who was the first President. As Mr Deane was of French nationality and could speak both French and Tahitian, he received a permit from the French government to open the first Adventist school. It is not known how many students attended this school, but it did not last long. =The School in Tahiti= From 1947 on, the pastors who came to French Polynesia were French- speaking. On 2 April 1960, when Pastor Ernest Veuthy was President, Pastor and Mrs Marcel Bornert opened the second French Polynesian school in Papeete, with an enrolment of 42 pupils. For many years, as the enrolment grew, this school struggled to obtain teachers. The only way to recruit new Adventist teachers was to send trainees to the college (now Saleve Adventist University) at Collonges-sous-Salève in France. The cost to students of this solution was almost prohibitive because of the distance (20,000 km), the length of the course (three or four years), and the cost of school fees. Understandably there was no rush of applicants. The next solution was to call for Adventist principals and teachers from France. Thus from 1964 to 1975 teachers such as Mrs Andrée Jérôme, Mr Marcel Fernandez, Mr Daniel Schmidt, Mr Christian Sanchez, and Mr Roland Vurpillot responded to such calls. The weaknesses of this system were the high cost to the Mission budget and the problem of changing staff every two years. =Government Assistance= Church leaders began to ask why they couldn’t ask the government for financial assistance. Back in 1789, during the French Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen had been promulgated, and church and state had been separated. However, as time passed the French State began to recognise that churches which operated schools were contributing to the development of the state by preparing trained citizens to hold responsibilities and contribute to national production. Thus in 1959 the French National Education Ministry issued the Loi Debré which allowed private schools, both Catholic and Protestant, to apply for financial appropriations. In September 1974 Pastor Jean Surel, Mission President, and Roland Vurpillot, the principal at that time, studied the question of accepting financial help from the government and the attached conditions. As a result, an agreement called Contrat simple was signed by the State, the Local Government, and the Mission. In September 1993 this arrangement was superseded by the Contrat d’association. The essential features of this contract are: :1 Teachers must have the Brevet élémentaire or the Baccalauréat. (The first year of university examination taken by high school students. Two years university study leads to the obtaining of a Licence which corresponds to a BA in the English system). :2 A new teacher can be recognised after a year of probation and sits a final examination after three years of training :3 Teachers in private and public schools are treated on the same level. :4 The State pays the teacher’s salary, whether qualified or not. :5 The State inspects the teacher in his/her class once he/she is qualified. :6 The private school is to follow the same curriculum as the public school. :7 There is a special appropriation for school stationery. :8 The Mission is responsible for the maintenance of the school building. This new contract solved the school’s financial problems, facilitated the upgrading of teachers’ qualifications and raised the school’s academic level. It made it possible for a public school teacher to come and serve in the Adventist school. In September 1975, the school already had six classes totalling 120 pupils from six to fifteen years of age. The mission had recently held a church session which voted two projects during the next five years: an Adventist college for secondary students and the extension downwards of the primary school to include the École Maternelle or infant school catering for children aged three, four, and five. The latter project took two years and a half. It took time for members and administrators to accept the value of such a project, and some of them remembered statements from early church documents known as the Spirit of Prophecy writings which discouraged parents from sending their children to school before the age of six. But eventually they came to realise that times had changed and their thinking must change also. On 16 February 1978 the new building opened, incorporating the elementary section (6 to 10 years) and the maternelle (3 to 5 years). At the opening Pastor Lazare Doom, the first local Mission President, named the school the Tiarama School. The name ‘tiarama’ means ‘lamp’ or ‘light’ in Tahitian. =Pic Vert College= The old school building was not destroyed. It became the first home of a new Adventist college, or secondary school, while a search for a more suitable site continued. In August 1979 Dr Jean Reynaud, previously from Avondale College in Australia, was privileged to start the first secondary class, and a new class was added each year until there were four. In August 1983 the college moved to its new location and became Collège du Pic Vert, with 110 students. It was situated above the valley of Tipaerui, a suburb of Papeete, on a hill called Pic Vert at some 460m above sea level, and only a drive of 15 minutes from the centre of Papeete. After Dr Reynaud’s departure in 1987 he was succeeded in turn by Dr Jean Michel Martin, Mrs Delargilière, Dettory Campus, and Imbert Jacques, all who came from France. Unfortunately, enrolment dropped each year after 1983, until in 1990 it was proposed to close the college. Only with government help could the school be kept open. It took four years to get government agreement for all four classes. Even with that help, the enrolments dropped steadily, until in 2000 the school opened with only 69 students. The decline was attributed partly to the isolation of the school, and the resulting transport problems, including the steep, winding road up the mountain. Accordingly in 2001 the college moved back down to the urban area of Papeete, to share the site with the elementary school. It was renamed Collège Tiarama, and since then it has experienced steady growth. Pastor Charles Atger, a Tahitian, is now in charge.

It was first published in the United States by HarperCollins.Alexandra Alter, Isabel Allende on Superstition and Memory, The Wall Street Journal, 23 April 2010, p. W4 The book was issued in 2009 in Spanish as La Isla Bajo el Mar, and was translated into English by Margaret Sayers Peden, who has translated all (except the first) of Allende's books into English. The story is set during the Haitian Revolution.  Plot The story opens on the island of Saint- Domingue (current day La Hispaniola) in the late 18th century. Zarite (known as Tete) is the daughter of an African mother she never knew and one of the white sailors who brought her into bondage. As a young girl Tete is purchased by Violette, a mixed race courtesan, on behalf of Toulouse Valmorain, a Frenchman who has inherited his father's sugar plantation. Valmorain has dreams of financial success and is somewhat ambivalent towards slavery. He views it as a means to an end, as he does most things. Upon Valmorain's marriage, Tete becomes his wife's personal slave. Valmorain's wife is fragile, beautiful, and slowly succumbs to madness. As Valmorain's wife goes mad, Valmorain forces Tete, the 9 year old house slave, into sexual servitude, which produces several illegitimate children. Spanning four decades, the narrative leaps between the social upheavals from the distant French Revolution through the immediate chaos of the Haitian Revolution, to a New Orleans fomenting with cultural change.

His outstanding performance earned him a spot on the roster. Harris played in two games in the 2012 season completing 8 of 19 throws for 80 yards. Harris continued his strong pre-season play in the first preseason game of the 2013 season; completing 8 of 11 passing attempts for 115 yards. During the 2014 CFL season Harris started in one game, and played in another 5 games. For the entire season he attempted 60 passes, completing 42 of them (70% completion percentage), for 449 passing yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception.

Within the first few hours of free-agency starting on February 9, 2016, the Ottawa Redblacks announced that Harris had signed with the team to a two-year contract.Redblacks land quarterback Trevor Harris He began the season as the backup to Henry Burris who turned 41 years old when the season began. Harris made his Redblacks debut partway through the opening game of the season after Burris injured his finger while receiving the ball from a shotgun snap. Harris completed 17 of 19 passing attempts for 292 yards, with 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions leading the Redblacks to a dramatic overtime victory over the defending Grey Cup champion Edmonton Eskimos. Following the game, it was announced that Burris would be placed on the 1-game injured list, making Harris the starting quarterback for Week 2. Only a couple days later it was announced that Burris had been transferred to the six-game injured list. Harris was named as a player of the week three times in the month of July, and chosen as the second best player in the month behind teammate wide-receiver Chris Williams. Harris was injured during a July 22 (Week 5) game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders and replaced by back-up Brock Jensen for the rest of the game. The following week (Week 6), Henry Burris returned from his injury as starting quarterback, and Harris was considered week-to-week with knee and ankle injuries. Following their Week 9 loss to the Alouettes, Ottawa Head Coach Rick Campbell announced that Harris would return to the starting lineup for Week 10 against the BC Lions. In his absence the club had lost three of their four games. Harris started in the next six games for the Redblacks but was ultimately unable to meet expectations, only winning two games and losing four. He was subsequently benched again in favour of Henry Burris. Under Burris' leadership the Redblacks went on to win the 104th Grey Cup. Within a week of winning the Grey Cup Redblacks General Manager Marcel Desjardins stated that based on the how the contracts are structured (for Burris and Harris) the team planned for Harris to be their starting quarterback for the 2017 season. Burris retired on January 24, 2017. Harris started the first 12 games of the 2017 season for the Redblacks before leaving the team's Week 12 game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats after suffering a shoulder injury. A couple days later it was announced by head coach Rick Campbell that Harris would be out at least a couple weeks with a bruised shoulder. Harris concluded the 2017 campaign having set new career highs in completions, attempts and passing yards, leading Ottawa to the playoffs for the third consecutive season. Not long after the season wrapped up the Redblacks and Harris agreed to a one-year contract extension keeping him with the club through the 2018 CFL season. Harris was set to become a free-agent in February 2018 had both sides not been able to come to deal. Harris had his most productive season in 2018, setting new career highs in pass attempts, completions, and yards. In the Redblacks' East Final playoff game against the Tiger-Cats, Harris set a new CFL record for most passing touchdowns in a single playoff game with six. He completed 29 of 32 pass attempts for 367 yards, leading the Redblacks to their third Grey Cup appearance in four years. However, Harris and the Redblacks were bested in the 106th Grey Cup by the Calgary Stampeders.  Edmonton Eskimos/Football Team  On February 12, 2019, it was announced that Harris had signed with the Edmonton Eskimos. Harris started in the Eskimos' first 12 games of the season before being ruled out for the team's Week 15 match against the Tiger-Cats with an upper body injury. Subsequently, he was placed on the six-game injured reserve list on September 27, 2019. Harris was activated off of the six-game injured reserve list on October 21, 2019, with two games remaining in the season. He finished the season having played and started in 13 regular season games, but still managed to pass for over 4,000 yards for the fourth time in his career. He also tripled his career touchdowns by rushing for six touchdowns during the 2019 regular season, bringing his career total to nine. He led the Eskimos to the East Final as the crossover team, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. During the following off- season, on January 31, 2020, Harris signed a contract extension with the Eskimos that would keep him in Edmonton through the 2022 season.

The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a more closely unified federal state, replacing the previously existing personal union of the two countries. The Union was largely run by the Polish and increasingly Polonized Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, through the system of the central parliament and local assemblies, but from 1573 led by elected kings. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility constituted a sophisticated early democratic system, in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe. The Polish–Lithuanian Union had become an influential player in Europe and a vital cultural entity, spreading Western culture eastward. In the second half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a huge state in central-eastern Europe, with an area approaching one million square kilometers. Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the culmination of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings. The Commonwealth, assertive militarily under King Stephen Báthory, suffered from dynastic distractions during the reigns of the Vasa kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV. It had also become a playground of internal conflicts, in which the kings, powerful magnats and factions of nobility were the main actors. The Commonwealth fought wars with Russia, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. At the Commonwealth's height, some of its powerful neighbors experienced difficulties of their own and the Polish–Lithuanian state sought domination in Eastern Europe, in particular over Russia. Allied with the Habsburg Monarchy, it did not directly participate in the Thirty Years' War. Tsar Ivan IV of Russia undertook in 1577 hostilities in the Livonian region, which resulted in his takeover of most of the area and caused the Polish–Lithuanian involvement in the Livonian War. The successful counter-offensive led by King Báthory and Jan Zamoyski resulted in the peace of 1582 and the retaking of much of the territory contested with Russia, with the Swedish forces establishing themselves in the far north (Estonia). Estonia was declared a part of the Commonwealth by Sigismund III in 1600, which gave rise to a war with Sweden over Livonia; the war lasted until 1611 without producing a definite outcome. In 1600, as Russia was entering a period of instability, the Commonwealth proposed a union with the Russian state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While the differences between the two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory. At the same time it was weakened by the huge military effort made. In 1620 the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Osman II declared a war against the Commonwealth. At the disastrous Battle of Ţuţora Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski was killed and the Commonwealth's situation in respect to the Turkish-Tatar invasion forces became very precarious. A mobilization in Poland-Lithuania followed and when Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz's army withstood fierce enemy assaults at the Battle of Khotyn (1621), the situation improved on the southeastern front. More warfare with the Ottomans followed in 1633–1634 and vast expanses of the Commonwealth had been subjected to Tatar incursions and slave-taking expeditions throughout the period. War with Sweden, now under Gustavus Adolphus, resumed in 1621 with his attack on Riga, followed by the Swedish occupation of much of Livonia, control of Baltic Sea coast up to Puck and the blockade of Danzig. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the warfare that had taken place elsewhere, in 1626–1627 mustered a response, utilizing the military talents of Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski and help from Austria. Under pressure from several European powers, the campaign was stopped and ended in the Truce of Altmark, leaving in Swedish hands much of what Gustavus Adolphus had conquered. Another war with Russia followed in 1632 and was concluded without much change in the status quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost to Sweden. At the conclusion of the hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia but kept most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.  Elective monarchy and republic of nobility  Stephen Báthory was one of a number of foreigners elected as kings At the outset of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the second half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an elective monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non- homogenous class. In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, the last king of the Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The political system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate it was determined that the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election. The election of Polish kings lasted until the Partitions of Poland. The elected kings in chronological order were: Henry of Valois, Anna Jagiellon, Stephen Báthory, Sigismund III Vasa, Władysław IV, John II Casimir, Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki, John III Sobieski, Augustus II the Strong, Stanisław Leszczyński, Augustus III and Stanisław August Poniatowski. Sigismund III Vasa's rule was a mixed blessing, but lasted for almost 45 years The first Polish royal election was held in 1573. The four men running for the office were Henry of Valois, who was the brother of King Charles IX of France, Tsar Ivan IV of Russia, Archduke Ernest of Austria, and King John III of Sweden. Henry of Valois ended up a winner. But after serving as the Polish king for only four months, he received the news that his brother, the King of France, had died. Henry of Valois then abandoned his Polish post and went back to France, where he succeeded to the throne as Henry III of France. A few of the elected kings left a lasting mark in the Commonwealth. Stephen Báthory was determined to reassert the deteriorated royal prerogative, at the cost of alienating the powerful noble families. Sigismund III, Władysław IV and John Casimir were all of the Swedish House of Vasa; preoccupation with foreign and dynastic affairs prevented them from making a major contribution to the stability of Poland-Lithuania. John III Sobieski commanded the allied Relief of Vienna operation in 1683, which turned out to be the last great victory of the \\"Republic of Both Nations\\". Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last of the Polish kings, was a controversial figure. On the one hand he was a driving force behind the substantial and constructive reforms belatedly undertaken by the Commonwealth. On the other, by his weakness and lack of resolve, especially in dealing with imperial Russia, he doomed the reforms together with the country they were supposed to help. Anne of Austria, Sigismund III's first wife The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, following the Union of Lublin, became a counterpoint to the absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi- democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented in the history of Europe. In itself, it constituted a fundamental precedent for the later development of European constitutional monarchies. However the series of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, undermined citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function and provide for national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning in the second half of the 17th century. After the series of devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Deluge), Poland- Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and serfdom, which, combined with the weakness of the urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest and most populous European states, was little more than a pawn of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.  Economic and social developments  Pieskowa Skała Castle The agricultural trade boom in Eastern Europe showed the first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The negative consequences of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination in the second half of the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation of the currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century. Jan Zamoyski Capital and energy of urban enterprisers affected the development of mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops at the turn of the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century. Danzig had remained practically autonomous and adamant about protecting its status and foreign trade monopoly. The Karnkowski Statutes of 1570 gave Polish kings the control over maritime commerce, but not even Stephen Báthory, who resorted to an armed intervention against the city, was able to enforce them. Other Polish cities held steady and prosperous through the first half of the 17th century. War disasters in the middle of that century devastated the urban classes. A rigid social separation legal system, intended to prevent any inter-class mobility, matured around the first half of the 17th century. But the nobility's goal of becoming self-contained and impermeable to newcomers had never been fully realized, as in practice even peasants on occasions acquired the noble status. Later numerous Polish szlachta clans had had such \\"illegitimate\\" beginnings. Szlachta found justification for their self-appointed dominant role in a peculiar set of attitudes, known as sarmatism, that they had adopted. Zamość Market Square The Union of Lublin accelerated the process of massive Polonization of Lithuanian and Rus' elites and general nobility in Lithuania and the eastern borderlands, the process that retarded national development of local populations there. In 1563, Sigismund Augustus belatedly allowed the Eastern Orthodox Lithuanian nobility access to highest offices in the Duchy, but by that time the act was of little practical consequence, as there were few Orthodox nobles of any standing left and the encroaching Catholic Counter-Reformation would soon nullify the gains.Lukowski, Jerzy and Zawadzki, Hubert (2006) A Concise History of Poland (2nd edition) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, pages 79–81, Many magnate families of the east were of Ruthenian origin; their inclusion in the enlarged Crown made the magnate class much stronger politically and economically. Regular szlachta, increasingly dominated by the great land owners, lacked the will to align themselves with Cossack settlers in Ukraine to counterbalance the magnate power, and in the area of Cossack acceptance, integration and rights resorted to delayed and ineffective half-measures. The peasantry was being subjected to heavier burdens and more oppression. For those reasons, the way in which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth expansion took place and developed had caused an aggravation of both the social and national tensions, introduced a fundamental instability into the system, and ultimately resulted in the future crises of the \\"Republic of Nobles\\".  Western and Eastern Christianity: Counter-Reformation, Union of Brest  Jakub Wujek's Bible translation was widely popular for centuries The increasingly uniform and polonized (in the case of ethnic minorities) szlachta of the Commonwealth for the most part returned to the Roman Catholic religion, or if already Catholic remained Catholic, in the course of the 17th century. Already the Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, which was an early expression of Protestant irenicism later prominent in Europe and Poland, had a self-defensive character, because of the intensification of Counter-Reformation pressure at that time. The agreement strengthened the Protestant position and made the Warsaw Confederation religious freedom guarantees in 1573 possible. At the heyday of Reformation in the Commonwealth, at the end of the 16th century, there were about one thousand Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. Half a century later, only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and a printing facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of more trouble to come.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 104 Krasiczyn Palace This Counter-Reformation offensive happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, where there were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with the Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed. The ideological war between the Protestant and Catholic camps at first enriched the intellectual life of the Commonwealth. The Catholic Church responded to the challenges with internal reform, following the directions of the Council of Trent, officially accepted by the Polish Church in 1577, but implemented not until after 1589 and throughout the 17th century. There were earlier efforts of reform, originating from the lower clergy, and from about 1551 by Bishop Stanislaus Hosius (Stanisław Hozjusz) of Warmia, a lone at that time among the Church hierarchy, but ardent reformer. At the turn of the 17th century, a number of Rome educated bishops took over the Church administration at the diocese level, clergy discipline was implemented and rapid intensification of Counter- Reformation activities took place. Stanislaus Hosius, one of the leading figures of the Counter-Reformation in Poland and Europe Hosius brought to Poland the Jesuits and founded for them a college in Braniewo in 1564. Numerous Jesuit educational institutions and residencies were established in the following decades, most often in the vicinity of centers of Protestant activity. Jesuit priests were carefully selected, well educated, of both noble and urban origins. They had soon become highly influential with the royal court, while working hard within all segments of the society. The Jesuit educational programs and Counter-Reformation propaganda utilized many innovative media techniques, often custom-tailored for a particular audience on hand, as well as time-tried methods of humanist instruction. Preacher Piotr Skarga and Bible translator Jakub Wujek count among prominent Jesuit personalities. Catholic efforts to win the population countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements to make it more accessible and attractive to the masses. The Church hierarchy went along with the notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come. The apex of the Counter-Reformation activity had fallen on the turn of the 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen the power of his monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped. Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski Although attempts were made during the common Protestant- Orthodox congregations in Toruń in 1595 and in Vilnius in 1599,Derwich, Marek and Żurek, Adam (editors) (2003) Rzeczpospolita Szlachecka, 1586–1795 (The Noble Republic: 1586–1795), page 27, Urszula Augustyniak. Wydawnictwo Dolnośląskie, Wrocław, .Pieśniarczyk, Piotr (1998) Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill) Agencja Benkowski, Białystok, Poland, page 133, . the failure of the Protestant movement to form an alliance with the Eastern Orthodox Christians, the inhabitants of the eastern portion of the Commonwealth, contributed to the Protestants' downfall. The Polish Catholic establishment would not miss the opportunity to form a union with the Orthodox, although their goal was rather the subjugation of the Eastern Rite Christians to the pope (the papacy solicited help in bringing the \\"schism\\" under control) and the Commonwealth's Catholic centers of power. The Orthodox establishment was perceived as a security threat, because of the Eastern Rite bishops dependence on the Patriarchate of Constantinople at the time of an aggravating conflict with the Ottoman Empire, and because of the recent development, the establishment in 1589 of the Moscow Patriarchate. The Patriarchate of Moscow then claimed ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which to many of them was a worrisome development, motivating them to accept the alternate option of union with the West.Norman Davies, Europe: A History, p. 505 The union idea had the support of King Sigismund III and the Polish nobility in the east; opinions were divided among the church and lay leaders of the Eastern Orthodox faith. The Union of Brest act was negotiated and solemnly concluded in 1595–1596. It had not merged the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations, but led to the establishment of the Slavic language liturgy Uniate Church, which was to become an Eastern Catholic Church, one of the Greek Catholic Churches (presently Ukrainian Greek Catholic and Belarusian Greek Catholic). The new church, of the Byzantine Rite, accepted papal supremacy, while it retained in most respects its Eastern Rite character. The compromise union was flawed from the beginning, because despite the initial agreement, the Greek-Catholic bishops were not, like their Roman Catholic counterparts, seated in the Senate, and the Eastern Rite participants of the union had not been granted full general equality they expected. Jan Brożek, rector of the Academy of Kraków, fought the Jesuits for control of academic teachingKalendarium dziejów Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, Copyright 1999 Wydawnictwo Literackie Kraków, , p. 135, Jakub Basista The Union of Brest increased antagonisms among the Belarusian and Ukrainian communities of the Commonwealth, within which the Orthodox Church had remained the most potent religious force. It added to the already prominent ethnic and class fragmentation and became one more reason for internal infighting that was to impair the Republic. The Eastern Orthodox nobility, branded \\"Disuniates\\" and deprived of legal standing, led by Konstanty Ostrogski commenced a fight for their rights. Prince Ostrogski had been a leader of an Orthodox intellectual revival in Polish Ukraine. In 1576, he founded an elite liberal arts secondary and academic school, the Ostroh Academy, with trilingual instruction. In 1581, he and his academy were instrumental in the publication of the Ostroh Bible, the Bible's first scholarly Orthodox Church Slavonic edition.Lukowski, Jerzy and Zawadzki, Hubert (2006) A Concise History of Poland (2nd edition) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, pages 86–87, As a result of the efforts, parliamentary statutes of 1607, 1609 and 1635 recognized the Orthodox religion again, as one of the two equal Eastern churches. The restoration of Orthodox hierarchy and administrative structure proved difficult (most bishops had become Uniates, and their Orthodox replacements of 1620 and 1621 were not recognized by the Commonwealth) and was officially done only during the reign of Władysław IV. Władysław, facing the Cossack rebellions, put an end to decades of efforts aimed at using the Uniate Church as an instrument of attempted elimination of the Orthodox religion. By that time many of the Orthodox nobles had become Catholics, and the Orthodox leadership fell into the hands of townspeople and lesser nobility organized into church brotherhoods, and the new power in the east, the Cossack warrior class. Metropolitan Peter Mogila of Kiev, who organized an influential academy there, contributed greatly to the rebuilding and reform of the Orthodox Church. The Uniate Church, created for the Ruthenian population of the Commonwealth, in its administrative dealings gradually switched to the Polish language use. From about 1650, the majority of the Church's archival documents generated were in the Polish, rather than in the otherwise used Ruthenian (its Chancery Slavonic variety), language.  Culture of Early Baroque  Treny (The Laments) by Jan Kochanowski, the great poet of early modern Poland (late Renaissance style) The Baroque style dominated the Polish culture from the 1580s, building on the achievements of the Renaissance and for a while coexisting with it, to the mid 18th century. Initially Baroque artists and intellectuals, torn between the two competing views of the world, enjoyed wide latitude and freedom of expression. Soon however the Counter-Reformation instituted a binding point of view that invoked the medieval tradition, imposed censorship in education and elsewhere (the index of prohibited books in Poland from 1617), and straightened out their convoluted ways. By the middle of the 17th century the doctrine had been firmly reestablished, sarmatism and religious zealotry had become the norm. Artistic tastes of the epoch were often acquiring an increasingly Oriental character. In contrast with the integrative tendencies of the previous period, the burgher and nobility cultural spheres went their separate ways. Renaissance publicist Stanisław Orzechowski had already provided the foundations for Baroque szlachta's political thinking. At that time there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) scattered throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to a lesser degree. Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class. Early Baroque St. Peter's and Paul's Church in Kraków; Giovanni Trevano was its principal designer By the mid 16th century Poland's university, the Academy of Kraków, entered a crisis stage, and by the early 17th century regressed into Counter- reformational conformism. The Jesuits took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a university college in Vilnius, but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad. Jan Brożek, a rector of the Kraków University, was a multidisciplinary scholar who worked on number theory and promoted Copernicus' work. He was banned by the Church in 1616 and his anti- Jesuit pamphlet was publicly burned. Brożek's co-worker, Stanisław Pudłowski, worked on a system of measurements based on physical phenomena. Michał Sędziwój (Sendivogius Polonus) was a famous in Europe alchemist, who wrote a number of treatises in several languages, beginning with Novum Lumen Chymicum (1604, with over fifty editions and translations in the 17th and 18th centuries). A member of Emperor Rudolph II's circle of scientists and sages, he is believed by some authorities to have been a pioneer chemist and a discoverer of oxygen, long before LavoisierZbigniew Szydlo -Water which does not wet hands: the alchemy of Michael Sendivogius, Warsaw 1994, Polish Academy of Sciences, (Sendivogius' works were studied by leading scientists, including Isaac Newton).Norman Davies, Europe: A History, pp. 529–531 Piotr Skarga, the influential Jesuit preacher The early Baroque period produced a number of noted poets. Sebastian Grabowiecki wrote metaphysical and mystical religious poetry representing the passive current of Quietism. Another szlachta poet Samuel Twardowski participated in military and other historic events; among the genres he pursued was epic poetry. Urban poetry was quite vital until the middle of the 17th century; the plebeian poets criticized the existing social order and continued within the ambiance of elements of the Renaissance style. The creations of John of Kijany contained a hearty dose of social radicalism. The moralist Sebastian Klonowic wrote a symbolic poem Flis using the setting of Vistula river craft floating work. Szymon Szymonowic in his Pastorals portrayed, without embellishments, the hardships of serf life. Maciej Sarbiewski, a Jesuit, was highly appreciated throughout Europe for the Latin poetry he wrote. The preeminent prose of the period was written by Piotr Skarga, the preacher-orator. In his Sejm Sermons Skarga severely criticized the nobility and the state, while expressing his support for a system based on strong monarchy. Writing of memoirs had become most highly developed in the 17th century. Peregrination to the Holy Land by Mikołaj Radziwiłł and Beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War written by Stanisław Żółkiewski, one of the greatest Polish military commanders, are the best known examples. Martin Kober's painting of Anna Jagiellon One form of art particularly apt for Baroque purposes was the theater. Various theatrical shows were most often staged in conjunction with religious occasions and moralizing, and commonly utilized folk stylization. School theaters had become common among both the Protestant and Catholic secondary schools. A permanent court theater with an orchestra was established by Władysław IV at the Royal Castle in Warsaw in 1637; the actor troupe, dominated by Italians, performed primarily Italian opera and ballet repertoire. Music, both sacral and secular, kept developing during the Baroque period. High quality church pipe organs were built in churches from the 17th century; a fine specimen has been preserved in Leżajsk. Sigismund III supported an internationally renowned ensemble of sixty musicians. Working with that orchestra were Adam Jarzębski and his contemporary Marcin Mielczewski, chief composers of the courts of Sigismund III and Władysław IV. Jan Aleksander Gorczyn, a royal secretary, published in 1647 a popular music tutorial for beginners. Martin Kober, a court painter from Wrocław, worked for Stephen Báthory and Sigismund III; he produced a number of well-known royal portraits. Between 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski commissioned the Venetian architect Bernardo Morando to build the city of Zamość. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism aesthetic paradigms. Daniel Schultz of Danzig, the painter's self-portrait Mannerism is the name sometimes given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland the last quarter of the 16th century and the first quarter of the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque. The Baroque art was developing to a great extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts. Beginning in the 1580s, a number of churches patterned after the Church of the Gesù in Rome had been built. Gothic and other older churches were increasingly being supplemented with Baroque style architectural additions, sculptures, wall paintings and other ornaments, which is conspicuous in many Polish churches today. The Royal Castle in Warsaw, after 1596 the main residence of the monarchs, was enlarged and rebuilt around 1611. The Ujazdów Castle (1620s) of the Polish kings turned out to be architecturally more influential, its design having been followed by a number of Baroque magnate residencies. Baranów Sandomierski The role of Baroque sculpture was usually subordinate, as decorative elements of exteriors and interiors, and on tombstones. A famous exception is the Sigismund's Column of Sigismund III Vasa (1644) in front of Warsaw's Royal Castle. Realistic religious painting, sometimes entire series of related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, but other than that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was to spend the rest of his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.  Sejm and sejmiks  Sejm session at the Royal Castle, Warsaw, 1622 After the Union of Lublin, the Senate of general sejm of the Commonwealth became augmented by Lithuanian high officials; the position of the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as members of the Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators. Sejm deputies doing legislative work were generally not able to act as they pleased. Regional szlachta assemblies, the sejmiks, were summoned before sessions of general sejm; there the local nobility provided their representatives with copious instructions on how to proceed and protect the interests of the area involved. Another sejmik was called after the Sejm's conclusion. At that time the deputies would report to their constituency on what had been accomplished. Danzig (Gdańsk) in 1575. The city historically has been a point of contention among the Polish, German and local interests. Sejmiks had become an important part of the Commonwealth's parliamentary life, complementing the role of general sejm. They sometimes provided detailed implementations for general proclamations of sejms, or made legislative decisions during periods when the Sejm was not in session, at times communicating directly with the monarch. There was little significant parliamentary representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants. The Jewish communities sent representatives to their own Va'ad, or Council of Four Lands. The narrow social base of the Commonwealth's parliamentary system was detrimental to its future development and the future of the Polish–Lithuanian statehood. From 1573 an \\"ordinary\\" general sejm was to be convened every two years, for a period of six weeks. A king could summon an \\"extraordinary\\" sejm for two weeks, as necessitated by circumstances; an extraordinary sejm could be prolonged if the parliamentarians assented. After the Union the Sejm of the Republic deliberated in more centrally located Warsaw, except that Kraków had remained the location of coronation sejms. The turn of the 17th century brought also a permanent migration of the royal court from Kraków to Warsaw. Lublin in 1618 The order of sejm proceedings was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would do most of the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with the Senate and the king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, the Senate, and the monarch. The lower chamber's rule of unanimity had not been rigorously enforced during the first half of the 17th century. General sejm was the highest organ of collective and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases. During the second half of the 17th century, for a variety of reasons, including abuse of the unanimity rule (liberum veto), sejm's effectiveness had declined, and the void was being increasingly filled by sejmiks, where in practice the bulk of government's work was getting done.  Nobility rule, first royal election  Henry of Valois, King of Poland in 1573–1574 The system of noble democracy became more firmly rooted during the first interregnum, after the death of Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his personal power, rather than become an executor of szlachta's will. A lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the situation, and the conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to be the right idea to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta. During the interregnum the szlachta prepared a set of rules and limitations for the future monarch to obey as a safeguard to ensure that the new king, who was going to be a foreigner, complied with the peculiarities of the Commonwealth's political system and respected the privileges of the nobility. As Henry of Valois was the first one to sign the rules, they became known as the Henrician Articles. The articles also specified the wolna elekcja (free election) as the only way for any monarch's successor to assume the office, thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in the future. The Henrician Articles summarized the accumulated rights of Polish nobility, including religious freedom guarantees, and introduced further restrictions on the elective king; as if that were not enough, Henry also signed the so-called pacta conventa, through which he accepted additional specific obligations. Newly crowned Henry soon embarked on a course of action intended to free him from all the encumbrances imposed, but the outcome of this power struggle was never to be determined. One year after the election, in June 1574, upon learning of his brother's death, Henry secretly left for France.  Stephen Báthory  Polish coin with the likeness of Stephen Báthory In 1575 the nobility commenced a new election process. The magnates tried to force the candidacy of Emperor Maximilian II, and on 12 December Archbishop Uchański even announced his election. This effort was thwarted by the execution movement szlachta party led by Mikołaj Sienicki and Jan Zamoyski; their choice was Stephen Báthory, Prince of Transylvania. Sienicki quickly arranged for a 15 December proclamation of Anna Jagiellon, sister of Sigismund Augustus, as the reigning queen, with Stefan Batory added as her husband and king jure uxoris. Szlachta's pospolite ruszenie supported the selection with their arms. Batory took over Kraków, where the couple's crowning ceremony took place on 1 May 1576. Stephen Báthory's reign marks the end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish parliamentary system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been trying to accomplish. Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court system from the monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, the ad hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention or will to persevere. Many thought that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz Jan Zamoyski, one of the most distinguished personalities of the period, became the king's principal adviser and manager. A highly educated and cultivated individual, talented military chief and accomplished politician, he had often promoted himself as a tribune of his fellow szlachta. In fact in a typical magnate manner, Zamoyski accumulated multiple offices and royal land grants, removing himself far from the reform movement ideals he professed earlier. The king himself was a great military leader and far-sighted politician. Of Batory's confrontations with members of the nobility, the famous case involved the Zborowski brothers: Samuel was executed on Zamoyski's orders, Krzysztof was sentenced to banishment and property confiscation by the sejm court. A Hungarian, like other foreign rulers of Poland, Batory was concerned with the affairs of the country of his origin. Batory failed to enforce the Karnkowski's Statutes and therefore was unable to control the foreign trade through Danzig (Gdańsk), which was to have highly negative economic and political consequences for the Republic. In cooperation with his chancellor and later hetman Jan Zamoyski, he was largely successful in the Livonian war. At that time the Commonwealth was able to increase the magnitude of its military effort: The combined for a campaign armed forces from several sources available could be up to 60,000 men strong. King Batory initiated the creation of piechota wybraniecka, an important peasant infantry military formation. In 1577 Batory agreed to George Frederick of Brandenburg becoming a custodian for the mentally ill Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, which brought the two German polities closer together, to the detriment of the Commonwealth's long-term interests.Anita J. Prażmowska – A History of Poland, 2004 Palgrave Macmillan, , p. 96  War with Russia over Livonia  Battle of Kircholm 1605 King Sigismund Augustus' Dominium Maris Baltici program, aimed at securing Poland's access to and control over the portion of the Baltic region and ports that the country had vital interests in protecting, led to the Commonwealth's participation in the Livonian conflict, which had also become another stage in the series of Lithuania's and Poland's confrontations with Russia. In 1563 Ivan IV took Polotsk. After the Stettin peace of 1570 (which involved several powers, including Sweden and Denmark) the Commonwealth remained in control of the main part of Livonia, including Riga and Pernau. In 1577 Ivan undertook a great expedition, taking over for himself, or his vassal Magnus, Duke of Holstein most of Livonia, except for the coastal areas of Riga and Reval. A success of the Polish–Lithuanian counter-offensive became possible as Batory was able to secure the necessary funding from the nobility. The Polish forces recovered Dünaburg and most of middle Livonia. The King and Zamoyski then opted for attacking directly the inland Russian territory necessary for keeping Russian communication lines to Livonia open and functioning. Polotsk was retaken in 1579 and the Velikiye Łuki fortress fell in 1580. The take-over of Pskov was attempted in 1581, but Ivan Petrovich Shuisky was able to defend the city despite a several months long siege. An armistice was arranged in Jam Zapolski in 1582 by the papal legate Antonio Possevino. The Russians evacuated all the Livonian castles they had captured, gave up the Polotsk area and left Velizh in Lithuanian hands. The Swedish forces, which took over Narva and most of Estonia, contributed to the victory. The Commonwealth ended up with the possession of the continuous Baltic coast from Puck to Pernau.  Sigismund III Vasa's reign  Sigismund III Vasa There were several candidates for the Commonwealth crown considered after the death of Stephen Báthory, including Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Anna Jagiellon proposed and pushed for the election of her nephew Sigismund Vasa, son of John III, King of Sweden and Catherine Jagellon and the Swedish heir apparent. The Zamoyski faction supported Sigismund, the faction led by the Zborowski family wanted Maximilian; two separate elections took place and a civil war resulted. The Habsburg's army entered Poland and attacked Kraków, but was repulsed there and then, while retreating in Silesia, crushed by the forces organized by Jan Zamoyski at the Battle of Byczyna (1588), where Maximilian was taken prisoner. In the meantime Sigismund also arrived and was crowned in Kraków, which initiated his long in the Commonwealth (1587–1632) reign as Zygmunt III Waza. The prospect of a personal union with Sweden raised for the Polish and Lithuanian ruling circles political and economic hopes, including favorable Baltic trade conditions and a common front against Russia's expansion. However concerning the latter, the control of Estonia had soon become the bone of contention. Sigismund's ultra-Catholicism appeared threatening to the Swedish Protestant establishment and contributed to his dethronement in Sweden in 1599. During the reign of Sigismund III, the Commonwealth reached its maximum extent after the Truce of Deulino Inclined to form an alliance with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening the power of the monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities. Stanisław Żółkiewski 1605–1607 brought fruitless confrontation between King Sigismund with his supporters and the coalition of opposition nobility. During the sejm of 1605 the royal court proposed a fundamental reform of the body itself, an adoption of the majority rule instead of the traditional practice of unanimous acclamation by all deputies present. Jan Zamoyski in his last public address reduced himself to a defense of szlachta prerogatives, thus setting the stage for the demagoguery that was to dominate the Commonwealth's political culture for many decades. For the sejm of 1606 the royal faction, hoping to take advantage of the glorious Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive constructive reform program. Instead the sejm had become preoccupied with the dissident postulate of prosecuting instigators of religious disturbances directed against non-Catholics; advised by Skarga, the King refused his assent to the proposed statute. The nobility opposition, suspecting an attempt against their liberties, called for a rokosz, or an armed confederation. Tens of thousands of disaffected szlachta, led by the ultra-Catholic Mikołaj Zebrzydowski and Calvinist Janusz Radziwiłł, congregated in August near Sandomierz, giving rise to the so-called Zebrzydowski Rebellion. Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski The Sandomierz articles produced by the rebels were concerned mostly with placing further limitations on the monarch's power. Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed out of it and demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's position would remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. Whatever was left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution to the crisis of authority was arrived at. But the victorious lords of the council had at their disposal no effective political machinery necessary to propagate the well-being of the Commonwealth, still in its Golden Age (or as some prefer Silver Age now), much further. In 1611 John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg was allowed by the Commonwealth sejm to inherit the Duchy of Prussia fief, after the death of Albert Frederick, the last duke of the Prussian Hohenzollern line. The Brandenburg Hohenzollern branch led the Duchy from 1618.Pieśniarczyk, Piotr (1998) Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill) Agencja \\"Benkowski\\", Białystok, Poland, page 183, Castle in Podhorce (Pidhirtsi) was built by Hetman Koniecpolski The reforms of the execution movement had clearly established the Sejm as the central and dominant organ of state power. But this situation in reality had not lasted very long, as various destructive decentralizing tendencies, steps taken by the szlachta and the kings, were progressively undermining and eroding the functionality and primacy of the central legislative organ. The resulting void was being filled during the late 16th and 17th centuries by the increasingly active and assertive territorial sejmiks, which provided a more accessible and direct forum for szlachta activists to promote their narrowly conceived local interests. Sejmiks established effective controls, in practice limiting the Sejm's authority; themselves they were taking on an ever-broader range of state matters and local issues. In addition to the destabilizing to the central authority role of the over 70 sejmiks, during the same period, the often unpaid army had begun establishing their own \\"confederations\\", or rebellions. By plunder and terror they attempted to recover their compensation and pursue other, sometimes political aims. Some reforms were being pursued by the more enlightened szlachta, who wanted to expand the role of the Sejm at the monarch's and magnate faction's expense, and by the elected kings. Sigismund III during the later part of his rule constructively cooperated with the Sejm, making sure that between 1616 and 1632 each session of the body produced the badly needed statutes. The increased efforts in the areas of taxation and maintenance of the military forces made possible the positive outcomes of some of the armed conflicts that took place during Sigismund's reign.  Cossacks and Cossack rebellions  Commonwealth Ukraine was being colonized, but the Kiev Voivodeship was among the many areas where Ruthenian, rather than Polish property owners predominated There weren't very many Cossacks in the mid 16th century in the south-eastern borderlands of Lithuania and Poland yet, but the first companies of Cossack light cavalry had become incorporated into the Polish armed forces already around that time. During the reign of Sigismund III Vasa, the Cossack problem was beginning to play its role as Rzeczpospolita's preeminent internal challenge of the 17th century. Conscious and planned colonization of the fertile, but underdeveloped region was pioneered in the 1580s and 1590s by the Ruthenian dukes of Volhynia. Of the Poles, only Jan Zamoyski, who penetrated the Bracław area, was economically active by the end of the 16th century. There and in the Kiev area Polish fortunes also began to develop, often through intermarriage with Ruthenian clans. In 1630, the great Ukrainian latifundia were dominated by Ruthenian families, such as the Ostrogski, Zbaraski and Zasławski. At the outset of the great civil war of 1648, the Polish settlers comprised barely 10% of the middle and petty nobility, for example in the well-researched Bracław Voivodeship and Kiev Voivodeship. The early Cossack rebellions were, therefore, instants of social uprising, rather than national anti-Polish movements. As class warfare they were ruthlessly stamped out by the state, which would sometimes take their leaders to Warsaw for execution. Zaporizhia region shown in color Cossacks were first semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic people of the Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their fighting prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run- away peasants from the eastern and other areas of the Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable from the point of view of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire. During this earlier period of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the separate Ukrainian national consciousness was being formed, influenced in part by the context and heroes of the Cossack uprisings. The legacy of Kievan Rus' was recognized, as was the heritage of the East Slavic Ruthenian language. Cossacks felt being members of the \\"Rus' Orthodox nation\\" (the Uniate Church was practically eliminated in the Dnieper region in 1633). But seeing themselves also as members of the (Polish) \\"Republic-Fatherland\\", they dealt with sejms and kings as its subjects. Cossacks and the Ruthenian nobility, until recently subjects of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, were not formally or otherwise connected to the Tsardom of Russia. Orthodox Ostrog Bible title page Besides the leaders of the uprisings, Ukrainian personalities of the period included Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, Samuel Zborowski, Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski and Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny. Many Cossacks were being hired to participate in wars waged by the Commonwealth. This status resulted in privileges and often constituted a form of social upward mobility; the Cossacks resented the periodic reductions in their enrollment. Cossack rebellions or uprisings typically assumed the form of huge plebeian social movements. The Ottoman Empire demanded a total liquidation of the Cossack power. The Commonwealth, however, needed the Cossacks in the south-east, where they provided an effective buffer against Crimean Tatars incursions. The other way to quell the Cossack unrest would be to grant the nobility status to a substantial portion of their population and thus assimilate them into the Commonwealth's power structure, which was what Cossacks aspired to. This solution was being rejected by the magnates and szlachta for political, economic and cultural reasons when there was still time for reform, before disasters struck. The Polish–Lithuanian establishment had instead shifted unsteadily between compromising with the Cossacks, allowing limited varying numbers, the so- called Cossack register (500 in 1582, 8000 in the 1630s), to serve with the Commonwealth army (the rest were to be converted into serfdom, to help the magnates in colonizing the Dnieper area), and brutally using military force in an attempt to subdue them. Jakiv Ostryanin, a Cossack leader Oppressive efforts, often led by Poles, including Crown tenants or their Jewish plenipotents, Ruthenian nobles of the Commonwealth and even upper-rank Cossack officers, to subjugate and exploit economically the Cossack territories and population in Zaporizhia region, resulted in a series of Cossack uprisings, of which the early ones could have served as a warning for szlachta legislators. While Ukraine was undergoing substantial economic development, Cossacks and peasants were by and large not among the beneficiaries of the process. In 1591 the bloodily suppressed Kosiński Uprising was led by Krzysztof Kosiński. New fighting took place already in 1594, when the Nalyvaiko Uprising engulfed large portions of Ukraine and Belarus. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski defeated the Cossack units in 1596 and Severyn Nalyvaiko was executed. A temporary pacification of relations followed in the early 17th century, when the many wars fought by the Commonwealth necessitated greater involvement by registered Cossacks. But the Union of Brest resulted in new tensions, as the Cossacks had become dedicated adherents and defenders of the Eastern Orthodoxy. The Time of Troubles period in Russia resulted in peasant rebellions, such as the one led by Ivan Bolotnikov, which contributed also to peasant unrest in the Commonwealth and to further insurgency by the Cossacks there. Crown Hetman Mikołaj Potocki fought the Cossacks, but was also one of the voices of reason and practicality: he appealed for restraining the Polish abuses, called for an establishment of a commission to deal with Ukrainian grievances, and initially defended Bohdan Khmelnytsky The uprising of Marek Zhmaylo of 1625 was confronted by Stanisław Koniecpolski and concluded with Mykhailo Doroshenko signing the Treaty of Kurukove. More fighting soon erupted and culminated in the \\"Taras night\\" of 1630, when the Cossack rebels under Taras Fedorovych turned against army units and noble estates. The Fedorovych Uprising was put under control by Hetman Koniecpolski. These events were followed by an increase in the Cossack registry (Treaty of Pereyaslav), but then a rejection of demands by Cossack elders during the convocation sejm of 1632. Cossacks wanted to participate in free elections as members of the Commonwealth and have religious rights of the \\"disuniate\\" Eastern Christians restored. The 1635 sejm voted instead further restrictions and authorized the construction of the Dnieper Kodak Fortress, to facilitate more effective control over the Cossack territories. Another round of fighting, the Pavluk Uprising, followed in 1637–1638. It was defeated and its leader Pavel Mikhnovych executed. Upon new anti-Cossack limitations and sejm statutes imposing serfdom on most Cossacks, the Cossacks rose up again in 1638 under Jakiv Ostryanin and Dmytro Hunia. The uprising was cruelly suppressed and the existing Cossack land properties were taken over by the magnates.Pieśniarczyk, Piotr (1998) Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill) Agencja \\"Benkowski\\", Białystok, Poland, pages 158–159, The Commonwealth's struggles with the Cossacks were being paid attention to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often raised the possibility of a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there. The harsh measures restored relative calm for a decade, until 1648. Seen by the establishment as the \\"golden peace\\", for the Cossacks and peasants the period brought the worst oppression. During that time the private dukedoms of Ukrainian potentates, such as the families of Kalinowski, Daniłowicz and Wiśniowiecki, rapidly expanded and the folwark-serfdom economy, only then (much later than in other parts of the Polish Crown) being introduced in Ukraine, caused still unprecedented levels of exploitation. The Cossack affair, perceived as a weak spot of the Commonwealth, was increasingly becoming an issue in international politics.  Władysław IV  Władysław IV Vasa by Peter Paul Rubens Władysław IV Vasa, son of Sigismund III, ruled the Commonwealth during 1632–1648. Born and raised in Poland, prepared for the office from the early years, popular, educated, free of his father's religious prejudices, he seemed a promising chief executive candidate. Władysław however, like his father, had the life ambition of attaining the Swedish throne by using his royal status and power in Poland and Lithuania, which, to serve his purpose, he attempted to strengthen. Władysław ruled with the help of several prominent magnates, among them Jerzy Ossoliński, Chancellor of the Crown, Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, and Jakub Sobieski, the middle szlachta leader. Władysław IV was unable to attract a wider szlachta following, and many of his plans had foundered because of lack of support in the increasingly ineffectual sejm. Because of his tolerance for non-Catholics, Władysław was also opposed by the Catholic clergy and the papacy. Toward the last years of his reign Władysław IV sought to enhance his position and assure his son's succession by waging a war on the Ottoman Empire, for which he prepared, despite the lack of nobility support. To secure this end the King worked on forming an alliance with the Cossacks, whom he encouraged to improve their military readiness and intended to use against the Turks, moving in that direction of cooperation further than his predecessors. The war never took place, and the King had to explain his offensive war designs during the \\"inquisition\\" sejm of 1646. Władysław's son Zygmunt Kazimierz died in 1647, and the King, weakened, resigned and disappointed, in 1648.  Seeking preponderance in Eastern Europe  Siege of Smolensk (1609–11) The turn of the 16th and 17th centuries brought changes that, for the time being, weakened the Commonwealth's powerful neighbors (The Tsardom of Russia, The Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire). The resulting opportunity for the Polish–Lithuanian state to improve its position depended on its ability to overcome internal distractions, such as the isolationist and pacifist tendencies that prevailed among the szlachta ruling class, or the rivalry between nobility leaders and elected kings, often intent on circumventing restrictions on their authority, such as the Henrician Articles. The nearly continuous wars of the first three decades of the new century resulted in modernization, if not (because of the treasury limitations) enlargement, of the Commonwealth's army. The total military forces available ranged from a few thousands at the Battle of Kircholm, to the over fifty thousands plus pospolite ruszenie mobilized for the Khotyn (Chocim) campaign of 1621. The remarkable during the first half of the 17th century development of artillery resulted in the 1650 publication in Amsterdam of the Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima book by Kazimierz Siemienowicz, a pioneer also in the science of rocketry. Despite the superior quality of the Commonwealth's heavy (hussar) and light (Cossack) cavalry, the increasing proportions of the infantry (peasant, mercenary and Cossack formations) and of the contingent of foreign troops resulted in an army, in which these respective components were heavily represented. During the reigns of the first two Vasas a war fleet was developed and fought successful naval battles (1609 against Sweden). As usual, fiscal difficulties impaired the effectiveness of the military, and the treasury's ability to pay the soldiers.  Moldavia  Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia towards the end of the 16th century As a continuation of the earlier plans for an anti-Turkish offensive, that had not materialized because of the death of Stefan Batory, Jan Zamoyski intervened in Moldavia in 1595. With the backing of the Commonwealth army Ieremia Movilă assumed the hospodar's throne as the Commonwealth's vassal. Zamoyski's army repelled the subsequent assault by the Ottoman Empire forces at Ţuţora. The next confrontation in the area took place in 1600, when Zamoyski and Stanisław Żółkiewski acted against Michael the Brave, hospodar of Wallachia and Transylvania. First Ieremia Movilă, who in the meantime had been removed by Michael in Moldavia, was reimposed, and then Michael was defeated in Wallachia at the Battle of Bucov. Ieremia's brother Simion Movilă became the new hospodar there and for a brief period the entire region up to the Danube had become the Commonwealth's dependency. Turkey soon reasserted its role, in 1601 in Wallachia and in 1606 in Transylvania. Zamoyski's politics and actions, which constituted the earlier stage of the Moldavian magnate wars, only prolonged Poland's influence in Moldavia and interfered effectively with the simultaneous Habsburg plans and ambitions in this part of Europe. Further military involvement at the southern frontiers ceased being feasible, as the forces were needed more urgently in the north.  War with Sweden  Lew Sapieha, Grand Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Sigismund III's crowning in Sweden took place in 1594 amid tensions and instability caused by religious controversies. As Sigismund returned to Poland, his uncle Charles, the regent, took the lead of the anti-Sigismund Swedish opposition. In 1598 Sigismund attempted to resolve the matter militarily, but the expedition to the country of his origin was defeated at the Battle of Linköping; Sigismund was taken prisoner and had to agree to the harsh conditions imposed. After his return to Poland, in 1599 the Riksdag of the Estates deposed him in Sweden, and Charles led the Swedish forces into Estonia. Sigismund in 1600 proclaimed the incorporation of Estonia into the Commonwealth, which was tantamount to a declaration of war on Sweden, at the height of Rzeczpospolita's involvement in Moldavia region. Jakub Sobieski, father of King John III Jürgen von Farensbach, given the command of the Commonwealth forces, was overpowered by the much larger army brought to the area by Charles, whose quick offensive resulted in the 1600 take-over of most of Livonia up to the Daugava River, except for Riga. The Swedes were welcomed by much of the local population, by that time increasingly dissatisfied with the Polish–Lithuanian rule. in 1601 Krzysztof Radziwiłł succeeded at the Battle of Kokenhausen, but the Swedish advances had been reversed up to (not including) Reval, only after Jan Zamoyski brought in a more substantial force. Much of this army, having been unpaid, returned to Poland. The clearing action was continued by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, who, with a small contingent of troops left, defeated the Swedish incursion at Paide (Biały Kamień) in 1604. In 1605 Charles, now Charles IX, the King of Sweden, launched a new offensive, but his efforts were crossed by Chodkiewicz's victories at Kircholm and elsewhere and the Polish naval successes, while the war continued without a decisive resolution being produced. In the armistice of 1611 the Commonwealth was able to keep the majority of the contested areas, as a variety of internal and foreign difficulties, including the inability to pay the mercenary soldiers and the Union's new involvement in Russia, precluded a comprehensive victory.  Attempts to subordinate Russia  Sigismund III at Smolensk After the deaths of Ivan IV and in 1598 of his son Feodor, the last tsars of the Rurik Dynasty, Russia entered a period of severe dynastic, economic and social crisis and instability. As Boris Godunov encountered resistance from both the peasant masses and the boyar opposition, in the Commonwealth the ideas of turning Russia into a subordinated ally, either through a union, or an imposition of a ruler dependent on the Polish–Lithuanian establishment, were rapidly coming into play. In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth mission to Moscow to propose a union with the Russian state, patterned after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable with those of the Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602. Tsaritsa Marina Mniszech In order to continue their efforts, the magnates took advantage of the earlier death of Tsarevich Dmitry (1591) under mysterious circumstances and of the appearance of False Dmitriy I, a pretender-impostor claiming to be the tsarevich. False Dmitriy was able to secure the cooperation and help of the Wiśniowiecki family and of Jerzy Mniszech, Voivode of Sandomierz, whom he promised vast Russian estates and a marriage with the voivode's daughter Marina. Dmitriy became a Catholic and leading an army of adventurers raised in the Commonwealth, with the tacit support of Sigismund III entered in 1604 the Russian state. After the death of Boris Godunov and the murder of his son Feodor, False Dmitriy I became the Tsar of Russia, and remained in that capacity until killed during a popular turmoil in 1606, which also eliminated the Polish presence in Moscow. Russia under the new tsar Vasili Shuysky remained unstable. A new false Dmitriy materialized and Tsaritsa Marina had even \\"recognized\\" in him her thought-to-be-dead husband. With a new army provided largely by the magnates of the Commonwealth, False Dmitriy II approached Moscow and made futile attempts to take the city. Tsar Vasili IV, seeking help from King Charles IX of Sweden, agreed to territorial concessions in Sweden's favor and in 1609 the Russo-Swedish anti-Dmitriy and anti-Commonwealth alliance was able to remove the threat from Moscow and strengthen Vasili. The alliance and the Swedish involvement in Russian affairs caused a direct military intervention on the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, instigated and led by King Sigismund III, with the support of the Roman Curia. Battle of Klushino (1610) The Polish army commenced a siege of Smolensk and the Russo-Swedish relief expedition was defeated in 1610 by Hetman Żółkiewski at the Battle of Klushino. The victory strengthened the position of the compromise-oriented faction of Russian boyars, which had already been interested in offering the Moscow throne to Władysław Vasa, son of Sigismund III. Fyodor Nikitich Romanov, the Patriarch of Moscow, was one of the leaders of the boyars. Under arrangements negotiated by Żółkiewski, the boyars deposed Tsar Vasili and accepted Władysław in return for peace, no annexation of Russia into the Commonwealth, the Prince's conversion to the Orthodox religion, and privileges, including exclusive rights to high offices in the Tsardom granted to the Russian nobility. After the agreement was signed and Władysław declared tsar, the Commonwealth forces entered the Kremlin (1610). The young Władysław Vasa was declared tsar in 1610, but the negotiated conditions for his elevation were not accepted or fulfilled by his father Sigismund III subsequently rejected the compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, which would mean complete subjugation of Russia, and as such was rejected by the bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only intensified the chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. The result of this situation and of the ruthless Commonwealth occupation in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in Moscow and a siege of the Polish garrison occupying the Kremlin. In the meantime, the Commonwealth forces after a long siege stormed and took Smolensk in 1611. At the Kremlin the situation of the Poles had been worsening despite occasional reinforcements, and the massive national and religious uprising was spreading all over Russia. Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin effectively led the Russians, a new rescue operation attempted by Hetman Chodkiewicz had failed and a capitulation of the Polish and Lithuanian forces at the Kremlin terminated in 1612 their involvement there. Mikhail Romanov, son of the imprisoned in Poland (since his rejection of Sigismund III's demand for the Russian throne) Patriarch Filaret, became the new tsar in 1613. Mikhail Romanov learned about his election to the Russian throne at the Ipatiev Monastery in 1613 The war effort, debilitated by a rebellious confederation established by the unpaid military, was continued. Turkey, threatened by the Polish territorial gains became involved at the frontiers, and a peace between Russia and Sweden was agreed to in 1617. Fearing the new alliance the Commonwealth undertook one more major expedition, which took over Vyazma and arrived at the walls of Moscow, in an attempt to impose the rule of Władysław Vasa again. The city would not open its gates and not enough military strength was brought in to attempt a forced take-over. Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth was able to take advantage of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses suffered in the earlier decades. In the Truce of Deulino of 1619 the Rzeczpospolita was granted the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth attained its greatest geographic extent,Pieśniarczyk, Piotr (1998) Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill) Agencja \\"Benkowski\\", Białystok, Poland, page 172, but the attempted union with Russia could not have been achieved, as the systemic, cultural and religious incompatibilities between the two empires proved to be insurmountable. The territorial annexations and the ruthlessly conducted wars left a legacy of injustice suffered and desire for revenge on the part of the Russian ruling classes and people. The huge military effort weakened the Commonwealth and the painful consequences of the adventurous policies of the Vasa court and its allied magnates were soon to be felt.  The Commonwealth and Silesia during Thirty Years' War  Chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński specialized in foreign policy and worked closely with King Władysław IV In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa reached an understanding with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed to cooperate and mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions. The pact neutralized the Habsburg Monarchy in regard to the Commonwealth's war with Russia, but had resulted in more serious consequences after the Bohemian Revolt gave rise to the Thirty Years' War in 1618. The Czech events weakened the position of the Habsburgs in Silesia, where there were large concentrations of ethnically Polish inhabitants, whose ties and interests at that time placed them within the Protestant camp. Numerous Polish Lutheran parishes, with schools and centers of cultural activity, had been established in the heavily Polish areas around Opole and Cieszyn in eastern Silesia, as well as in numerous cities and towns throughout the region and beyond, including Breslau (Wrocław) and Grünberg (Zielona Góra). The threat posed by a potentially resurgent Habsburg monarchy to the situation of Polish Silesians was keenly felt, and there were voices within King Sigismund's circle, including Stanisław Łubieński and Jerzy Zbaraski, who brought to his attention Poland's historic rights and options in the area. The King, an ardent Catholic, advised by many not to involve the Commonwealth on the Catholic-Habsburg side, decided in the end to act in their support, but unofficially. The ten thousand men strong Lisowczycy mercenary division, a highly effective military force, had just returned from the Moscow campaign, and having become a major nuisance for the szlachta, was available for another assignment abroad; Sigismund sent them south to assist Emperor Ferdinand II. Sigismund court's intervention greatly influenced the first phase of the war, helping save the position of the Habsburg Monarchy at a critical moment. Władysław IV The Lisowczycy entered northern Hungary (now Slovakia) and in 1619 defeated the Transylvanian forces at the Battle of Humenné. Prince Bethlen Gábor of Transylvania, who together with the Czechs had laid siege to Vienna, had to hurry back to his country and make peace with Ferdinand, which seriously compromised the situation of the Czech insurgents, crushed in the course and in the aftermath of the Battle of White Mountain. Afterwards the Lisowczycy ruthlessly fought to suppress the Emperor's opponents in Glatz (Kłodzko) region and elsewhere in Silesia, in Bohemia and Germany. After the breakdown of the Bohemian Revolt the residents of Silesia, including the Polish gentry in Upper Silesia, were subjected to severe repressions and Counter-Reformational activities, including forced expulsions of thousands of Silesians, many of whom ended up in Poland. Later during the war years the province was repeatedly ravaged in the course of military campaigns crossing its territory, and at one point a Protestant leader, Piast Duke John Christian of Brieg, appealed to Władysław IV Vasa for assuming supremacy over Silesia. King Władysław, although a tolerant ruler including in matters of religion, was like his father disinclined to involve the Commonwealth in the Thirty Years' War. He ended up getting as fiefs from the Emperor the duchies of Opole and Racibórz in 1646, twenty years later reclaimed by the Empire. The Peace of Westphalia allowed the Habsburgs to do as they pleased in Silesia, already completely ruined by the war, which had resulted in intense persecution of Protestants, including the Polish Lower Silesia communities, forced to emigrate or subjected to Germanization.  Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate  Black Sea area around 1600 Although the Rzeczpospolita had not formally participated directly in the Thirty Years' War, the alliance with the Habsburg Monarchy contributed to getting Poland involved in new wars with the Ottoman Empire, Sweden and Russia, and therefore led to significant Commonwealth influence over the course of the Thirty Years' War. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth also had its own intrinsic reasons for the continuation of struggles with the above powers. From the 16th century the Commonwealth suffered a series of Tatar invasions. In the 16th century Cossack raids began descending on the Black Sea area Turkish settlements and Tatar lands. In retaliation the Ottoman Empire directed their vassal Tatar forces, based in Crimea or Budjak areas, against the Commonwealth regions of Podolia and Red Ruthenia. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people had been captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate. Castle in Nowy Wiśnicz The greatest intensity of Cossack raids, reaching as far as Sinop in Turkey, fell on the 1613–1620 period. The Ukrainian magnates on their part continued their traditional involvement in Moldavia, where they kept trying to install their relatives (the Movileşti family) on the hospodar's throne (Stefan Potocki in 1607 and 1612, Samuel Korecki and Michał Wiśniowiecki in 1615). Ottoman chief Iskender Pasha destroyed the magnate forces in Moldavia and compelled Stanisław Żółkiewski in 1617 to consent to the Treaty of Busza at Poland's border, in which the Commonwealth obliged not to get involved in matters concerning Wallachia and Transylvania. Turkish unease about Poland's influence in Russia, the consequences of the Lisowczycy expedition against Transylvania, an Ottoman fief in 1619 and the burning of Varna by the Cossacks in 1620 caused the Empire under the young Sultan Osman II to declare a war against the Commonwealth, with the aim of breaking and conquering the Polish–Lithuanian state.Pieśniarczyk, Piotr (1998) Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill) Agencja \\"Benkowski\\", Białystok, Poland, page 175–176, The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at its greatest extent, after the Truce of Deulino (Dywilino) of 1619 The actual hostilities, which were to bring the demise of Stanisław Żółkiewski, were initiated by the old Polish hetman. Żółkiewski with Koniecpolski and a rather small force entered Moldavia, hoping for military reinforcements from Moldavian Hospodar Gaspar Graziani and the Cossacks. The aid had not materialized and the hetmans faced a superior Turkish and Tatar force led by Iskender Pasha. In the aftermath of the failed Battle of Ţuţora (1620) Żółkiewski was killed, Koniecpolski captured, and the Commonwealth left opened defenseless, but disagreements between the Turkish and Tatar commanders prevented the Ottoman army from immediately waging an effective follow-up. The Sejm was convened in Warsaw, the royal court was blamed for endangering the country, but high taxes for a sixty thousand men army were agreed to and the number of registered Cossacks was allowed to reach forty thousand. The Commonwealth forces, led by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, were helped by Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny and his Cossacks, who raised against the Turks and Tatars and participated in the upcoming campaign. In practice about 30,000 regular army and 25,000 Cossacks faced at Khotyn a much larger Ottoman force under Osman II. Fierce Turkish attacks against the fortified Commonwealth positions lasted throughout September 1621 and were repelled. The exhaustion and depletion of its forces made the Ottoman Empire sign the Treaty of Khotyn, which had kept the old territorial status quo of Sigismund II (Dniester River border between the Commonwealth and Ottoman combatants), a favorable for the Polish side outcome. After Osman II was killed in a coup, ratification of the treaty was obtained from his successor Mustafa I. Battle of Khotyn (1621) In response to further Cossack attacks Tatar incursions continued as well, in 1623 and 1624 reaching almost as far west as the Vistula, with the attendant plunder and taking of captives. More effective defense was put together by the freed Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki, who defeated the Tatars on several occasions between 1624 and 1633, using the quarter army supported by the Cossacks and general population. More warfare with the Ottomans took place in 1633–1634 and ended with a peace treaty. In 1644 Koniecpolski defeated Tugay Bey's army at Okhmativ and before his death planned an invasion against the Crimean Khanate. King Władysław IV's ideas of a grand international war-crusade against the Ottoman Empire were thwarted by the inquisition sejm in 1646. The state's inability to control the activities of the magnates and the Cossacks had contributed to the semi-permanent instability and danger at the Commonwealth's south-eastern frontiers.  Baltic area territorial and maritime access losses  Poznań ca. 1617 More acute threat to the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The balance of power in the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic neighbor was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence. Gustavus Adolphus chose to attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's foremost trade center,Piotr Pieśniarczyk, Historia Polski w pigułce (History of Poland in a Pill), p. 165 in late August 1621, just as the Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish forces there. The city, stormed several times, had to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south the Swedes next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport in the region and an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but the Swedes were to take over most of Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof. Władysław IV's rescue of Smolensk accomplished, 1634 The losses impacted severely the trade and customs income of the Great Duchy of Lithuania. The Crown lands were to be also affected, as in July 1626 the Swedes took Pillau and forced Duke George William, Elector of Brandenburg and vassal of the Commonwealth in the attacked Ducal Prussia, to assume a neutrality stance. The Swedish advance resulted in the take-over of the Baltic coastline up to Puck. Danzig (Gdańsk), which had remained loyal to the Commonwealth, was subjected to a naval blockade. The Poles, completely surprised by the Swedish invasion, in September attempted a counter-offensive, but were defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Gniew. The forces required serious modernization. The Sejm passed high taxation for the defense, but collections lagged behind. The situation was partially saved by the City of Danzig, which hurriedly embarked on the construction of modern fortifications, and by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The accomplished commander of the eastern borderlands fighting quickly learned the maritime affairs and contemporary methods of European warfare. Koniecpolski promoted the necessary enlargement of the naval fleet, modernization of the army, and became a fitting counterbalance for the military abilities of Gustavus Adolphus. Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, the second wife of Władysław IV, arrives in Danzig in 1646 Koniecpolski led a spring 1627 military campaign, trying to keep the Swedish army in the Duchy of Prussia from moving toward Danzig, while also intending to block their reinforcements arriving from the Holy Roman Empire. Moving quickly the Hetman recovered Puck, and then destroyed at the Battle of Czarne (Hammerstein) the forces intended for Gustavus. The Swedes themselves Koniecpolski's forces kept near Tczew, shielding the access to Danzig and preventing Gustavus Adolphus from reaching his main objective. At the Battle of Oliva the Polish ships defeated a Swedish naval squadron. Danzig was saved, but the next year the strengthened in the Ducal Prussia Swedish army took Brodnica, and early in 1629 defeated the Polish units at Górzno. Gustavus Adolphus from his Baltic coast position laid an economic siege against the Commonwealth and ravaged what he had conquered. At this point allied forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein were brought in to help keep the Swedes in check. Forced by the combined Polish-Austrian action Gustavus had to withdraw from Kwidzyn to Malbork, in process being defeated and almost taken prisoner by Koniecpolski at the Battle of Trzciana. But in addition to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus to intervene in the Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.  Compromised power  Frederick William was the last Prussian duke to perform the act of homage before the Polish king As Władysław IV was assuming the Commonwealth crown, Gustavus Adolphus, who had been working on organizing an anti-Polish coalition including Sweden, Russia, Transylvania and Turkey, died. The Russians then undertook an action of their own, attempting to recover lands lost in the Truce of Deulino. In the fall of 1632 a well-prepared Russian army took a number of strongholds on the Lithuanian side of the border and commenced a siege of Smolensk. The well- fortified city was able to withstand a general onslaught followed by a ten- month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months of fierce fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small adjustments in favor of the Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne. Having secured the eastern front, the King was able to concentrate on the recovery of Baltic areas lost by his father to Sweden. Władysław IV wanted to take advantage of the Swedish defeat at Nördlingen and fight for both the territories and his Swedish dynastic claims. The Poles were suspicious of his designs and war preparations and the King was able to proceed with negotiations only, where his unwillingness to give up the dynastic claim weakened the Commonwealth's position. According to the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf of 1635 the Swedes evacuated Royal Prussia's cities and ports, which meant a return of the Crown's lower Vistula possessions, and stopped collecting custom duties there. Sweden retained most of Livonia, while the Rzeczpospolita kept Courland, which having assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade entered a period of prosperity. Sigismund III's second wife Constance of Austria with son John II Casimir, future king The position of the Commonwealth with respect to the Duchy of Prussia kept getting weaker, as the power in the Duchy was being taken over by the Electors of Brandenburg. Under the electors, the Duchy had become ever more closely linked to Brandenburg, which was harmful to the political interests of the Commonwealth. Sigismung III left the Duchy's administration in the hands of Joachim Frederick, and then John Sigismund, who in 1611 acquired the right to Hohenzollern succession in the Duchy by the consent of the King and the Sejm. He actually became the Duke of Prussia in 1618, after the death of Albert Frederick, and was followed by George William and then Frederick William, who in 1641 in Warsaw for the last time paid a Prussian homage to a Polish king. The successive Brandenburg dukes would make nominal concessions, to satisfy the Commonwealth's expediencies and justify the granting of privileges, but an irreversible shift in relations was taking place. In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania died. He was the last of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of Pomerania. Sweden acquired the Pomeranian rule, while the Commonwealth was only able to get back its fiefs, Bytów Land and Lębork Land. Słupsk Land was also sought by Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of Pomerania adjacent to the border of the Commonwealth, extending south to where it met with Habsburg lands. Portions of Pomerania were populated by the Slavic Kashubians and Slovincians. The Thirty Years' War period brought the Commonwealth a mixed legacy, rather more losses than gains, with the Polish–Lithuanian state retaining its status as one of the few great powers in central-eastern Europe. From 1635 the country enjoyed a period of peace, during which internal bickering and progressively dysfunctional legislative processes prevented any substantial reforms from taking place. The Commonwealth was unprepared to deal with grave challenges that materialized in the middle of the century.

He sees an oligarchy of propertied upper nobility, who discriminated against and took advantage of everybody else, including the vast majority of the nobility class (szlachta). b.According to Daniel Beauvois, the Union of Brest, established to get rid of the Eastern Orthodoxy on Polish-ruled lands, was the tool for the oppression of the Ruthenian population and the root cause of the Ruthenian (Ukrainian) enmity toward the Poles, which has since continued throughout history. c.Contemporary accounts report widespread killing, acts of cruelty and abuse committed by the forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in Russia. Atrocities were commonly practiced by both sides, but the military offensives were undertaken by the Poles, who dealt with the local civilian population. Aleksander Gosiewski, the first commandant of the Polish garrison at the Kremlin in 1610, vainly tried to curb his subordinates' misbehavior by imposing harsh penalties in turn on them. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski wrote of a great slaughter in Moscow, \\"as on the Day of Judgement\\", clearly sympathizing with the untold loss and the plight of the extensive, prosperous and affluent Russian capital, burning and wasting in an enormous bloodshed. Gosiewski ordered the use of fire to expel the Russian opponents; the fires caused the death of 6,000 - 7,000 people in Moscow. Gosiewski ordered the deposed Tsar Shuysky and his brothers to be deported to Poland and had Hermogenes imprisoned, after the patriarch (successfully) called for a rising against the Poles and their supporters.

Description The males are a bright electric blue (with greenish tints) and have two rows of reddish orange spines along the edges of the femur. There are also dark coloured spines going along the sides and underneath the thorax. Males are brachypterous (incapable of flight) and have small reduced wings. The forewings are a bright yellow; the hind wings have a yellow ridge and are primarily red with a black centre. The male’s abdomen tip finishes like a club tail. The 7th and 8th tergum (abdominal segments) both extend outwards along the sides giving it the gradual shape of a hexagon. The 9th tergite is like the rest of the abdomen but has a pair of cerci for mating. Cerci are like claspers (which dragonflies possess) that help the male get a grasp of the female during copulation. Females have a duller outlook. They are a light brown with red spines covering the entire thorax and the top of the head. (Males have an absence of spines on the head). The femur has spines on the edges but not colourful like the males. There are a few patches of light cyan on the coxa, the inner part of the femur and sometimes the head. The female is also brachypterous. The only difference separating her from the male is that the yellow pigment on the wings is not at all as pronounced. The female’s abdomen ends in a point (because of her ovipositor) rather than finishing like a club. Both male and female possess white-ish stripes along the top and sides of the head. The male grows up to 13 cm in length while the female is much bigger and can grow up to 18, 5 cm in length. Diet Their diet in the wild is unknown but in captivity they mainly feed on bramble, raspberry, eucalyptus, and oak. Reproduction Portrait of male and partial view of a female in the background Both sexes of the A. fallax are required to reproduce. The female lays eggs in the soil. These eggs are then incubated in between six and nine months. Temperature: In captivity for adults, the temperature should be in between 24C to 28C. For eggs, the temperature should be around 18C to 25C. The ova that are in the soil should be sprayed with water once daily. Humidity: The humidity should be from 50% to 60%. The cage should be well ventilated A damp cloth at the bottom of the cage is recommended in order to keep moisture in the phasmid’s surroundings. If there isn’t enough moisture, the phasmid could have trouble moulting (breaking through its old skin) and could possibly die. Life span: Based on captive bred experience lifespan around 8-10 months from hatching - around 3-4 months as adults. Longevity in the wild not known.

He was one of the organizers of the first Havana Biennial in 1984 and remained central to the curatorial team until he resigned in 1989. Since then, his activity turned to be mainly international: he has been traveling, lecturing and curating exhibitions in more than 80 countries. Mosquera was adjunct curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, from 1995 to 2009. Since 1995 he is advisor in the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kusten in Amsterdam. His publications include several books on art and art theory (and a short stories' volume), and more than 600 articles, reviews and essays have appeared in numerous magazines, including: Art Nexus, Cahiers, Lápiz, Neue Bildende Kunst, Oxford Art Journal, Poliester, Third Text. Among other volumes, Mosquera has edited Beyond the Fantastic: Contemporary Art Criticism from Latin America and co-edited (with Jean Fisher) Over Here: International Perspectives on Art and Culture. His theoretical essays – which have been influential in discussing art’s cultural dynamics in an internationalized world, and contemporary Latin American art – are dispersed in English, but have been collected in books in CaracasContracandela, Caracas, Monte Ávila Editores, 1995. and MadridCaminar con el Diablo.

Early work Gerardo Mosquera and Ana Mendieta in Havana in 1981. Mosquera obtained his licenciatura in History of Art at the University of Havana in 1977. Since the early 1970s he was working as art, cinema and theater critic, researcher and journalist in Havana. He published thorough investigations on Servando Cabrera Moreno and Manuel MendiveHis essays on Cabrera Moreno and Mendive were later gathered in Gerardo Mosquera, Exploraciones en la plástica cubana, La Habana: Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1983. two Cuban artists who had previously been marginalized for the erotic and religious Afro-Cuban (Mendive) content of their art, and as a result of homophobic cultural policies. Mosquera became the main critic and “ideologist” of the new Cuban art,Lucy Lippard: \\"Prólogo\\", in Gerardo Mosquera: Contracandela.

In the 1980s this movement renovated the Cuban art scene, breaking away from official dogmatism and introducing contemporary critical tendencies. It was successful in pushing the Ministry of Culture to open up towards a more liberal cultural policy. Mosquera’s critical writings on the new Cuban art were instrumental to this turn, while he also promoted the new artists internationally.Rachel Weiss, To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. This movement triggered a critical and reflexive inclination that distinguishes Cuba’s arts until today. Mosquera’s work has also always looked beyond Cuba, as can be seen in his book El diseño se definió en Octubre (Design was Defined in October),\\"El Diseño se Definió en Octubre\\", Editorial Arte y Literatura, Havana, 1989, and Banco de la República, Bogotá, 1992 about Russian avant-garde art and design and its worldly impact, published in Havana in 1989 and Bogotá in 1992. Havana Biennial Flavio Garciandía, Marta María Pérez Bravo, Gerardo Mosquera, and Armando Álvarez at the 2nd Havana Biennial, 1986. The first Havana Biennial took place in 1984. It became the fourth international biennial (after Venice, São Paulo and Sydney) and the sixth huge international periodic art event to be established —following the aforementioned biennials, the Carnegie International and Documenta. Supported by the Cuban government, it was a vast show, but restricted to Latin America. In 1986 the 2nd Havana Biennial presented the first global show of contemporary art ever: more than 50 exhibitions and events that gathered 690 artists from 57 countries focusing on postcolonial contemporary art and not on traditional and religious practices. The next Biennial edition, in 1989, introduced radical curatorial changes that moved it away from the Venice and São Paulo paradigms, launching a new model that influenced the way in which the new biennials were organized. Transformations included basing the whole event (shows, conferences, workshops, etc.) on a general theme, the combination of a centralized curation that avoided national representations with a decentralized structure involving a constellation of multiple events, the link with the city, and the eradication of awards. Recently, it has become clear that it was the Havana Biennial and not Les magiciens de la terre –an exhibition that was advertised as “the first global show”—, that was initiating the way in which globalization will take shape in art, triggering “a new breed of contemporary biennials born of a global context” (Istanbul, Johannesburg, Gwangju, Lyon, etc.).Rafal Niemojewski, \\"″Venice or Havana: A Polemic on the Genesis of the Contemporary Biennial”″, in Elena Filipovic, Mieke van Hal & Solveig Øvstebø (editors): The Bienal Reader.

The Havana Biennial approached for the first time the multiple practices of contemporary art around the world, out of the Western mainstream. Since 1984, Mosquera was Havana Biennial's \\"leader of the curatorial work\\",Rachel Weiss, “A Certain Place and a Certain Time: The Third Bienal de La Habana and the Origins of the Global Exhibition”, Rachel Weiss and other authors, Making Art Global (Part 1).

After his resignation to the Havana Biennial, Mosquera was banned to publish, curate and lecture in his country until today, and since then he has been working as a freelance internationally. In 1990 he was a Guggenheim Fellow. From 1995 to 2009 he was adjunct Curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, although his work was seriously hampered by legal constraints due to the United States embargo against Cuba, where he continued to live. Together with Dan Cameron he set off a program at the Museum that introduced a broader international approach in the New York art scene. His radical notion of “the museum-as-hub”Gerardo Mosquera, “Seven Notes on the Museum-as-Hub”, Re-Shuffle / Notions of an Itinerant Museum, New York: Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, 2006. transformed the New Museum’s Education Department to include what is called the Museum as Hub, “a new model for curatorial practice and institutional collaboration established to enhance our understanding of contemporary art. Both a network of relationships and an actual physical site…”www.museumashub.org/about with an international program of its own. Mosquera's theoretical work pioneered critical discussions about the complex cultural processes of modern and contemporary art from non- mainstream countries, especially in relation to mainstream art, globalization and postcolonial dynamics.Zoya Kocur and Simon Leung (editors): \\"Theory in Contemporary Art since 1985\\", Malden, Oxford and Victoria, Blackwell Publishing, 2005. He has also contributed to promote an open, multifaceted view on Latin American art, moving away from the identity stereotypes that prevailed in the 1980sCarmen Hernández, \\"Más allá de la exotización y la sociologización del arte latinoamericano\\", in: Daniel Mato (coord.): \\"Estudios y Otras Prácticas Intelectuales Latinoamericanas en Cultura y Poder\\", Caracas, CLACSO and CEAP, FACES, Universidad Central de Venezuela, 2002, pp 167-176. – his standings being sometimes polemical.Gerardo Mosquera, “Against Latin American Art”, in Contemporary Art in Latin America, London, Black Dog Publishing, 2010, p. 11-23. The exhibition Ante America, which he co-curated in 1992 (see below), was a landmark for this new view on Latin American art. Mosquera’s ideas, position and curatorial and editorial practice have been significant in the new scenario of broad international circulation of art.Jean Fisher: \\"No desde cualquier lugar\\", in Gerardo Mosquera: Caminar con el diablo.

Green developed Zimride after sharing rides from the University of California, Santa Barbara campus to visit his girlfriend in Los Angeles. He had used Craigslist's ride boards, but wanted to eliminate the anxiety of not knowing the passenger or driver. He began working on the app after Facebook opened its API to third-party developers.Bell, Josh. Two Startups Harness Facebook's Power to Connect Riders to Rides. ABC News. September 4, 2007.

Initially part of the house guard at the royal residences for Louis XVI, Klein left the military in 1787. During the French Revolution, he enlisted and rose rapidly from a lieutenant to a brigadier general; he participated in the French invasion of southwestern Germany in 1796, and was part of the Army of the Danube in 1799. His cavalry played critical roles in the battles of Austerlitz and Jena and Auerstadt. Following the Prussian campaign, he retired from active service, entered politics, and performed administrative duties in Paris. Klein served in the French Senate, and voted for Napoleon Bonapartes abdication in 1814; he did not participate in the Hundred Days and Louis XVIII of France raised him to the French peerage upon the second restoration. Military career Initially, Klein served in the royal house guard for the King of France, holding the prestigious position as guard of the gate. He left military service in 1787. After the French Revolution began in 1789, he rejoined the military and in 1792, he was listed as an infantry lieutenant in the Army of the North. His cavalry regiment participated in the Battle of Fleurus. Eudoxe Soulié; Musée national de Versailles et des Trianons. Notice des peintures et sculptures composant le Musée Impérial. Versailles : Montalant-Bougleux, 1854–1855, v. 1, p. 358. =French Revolutionary Wars= By 1795, Klein was a brigadier general in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, where he replaced Adjutant-General Michel Ney.Louis Hennequin. Zürich. Masséna en Suisse, messidor an vii-brumaire an viii (juillet-octobre 1799). Paris, Nancy, Berger-Levrault, 1911. p. 179. Klein was appointed general of division in 1799 and crossed the Rhine at Kehl in Jean- Baptiste Jourdans Army of the Danube. He commanded the right flank of the Advance Guard, under command of François Joseph Lefebvre. His command included the 4th and 5th Hussar Regiments, the 17th Dragoons, the 1st Chasseurs à cheval, a light horse regiment, two companies of horse artillery, two of foot artillery, and a company of sappers.Roland Kessinger and Geert van Uythoven. Order of Battle, Army of the Danube . Stockach: Roland Kessinger & Geert van Uythoven. Accessed 14 April 2010. At the Battle of Ostrach, Klein's cavalry helped to secure the village of Hosskirch, a strategically important forward post, prior to the general engagement.Jourdan, Jean-Baptiste, A Memoir of the operations of the army of the Danube under the command of General Jourdan, taken from the manuscripts of that officer. London: Debrett, 1799, pp. 144–145. After the French losses at Ostrach and the subsequent Battle of Stockach, Jourdan ordered a general withdrawal to the Black Forest. The reserve cavalry and most of Klein's division crossed the mountains and quartered near Offenburg, where their horses could find better forage. Despite the organized withdrawal and the relatively secure positions on the western side of the Black Forest, the army was in shambles. Jourdan placed his chief of staff Jean Augustin Ernouf in provisional command and went to Paris to complain about the state of his army, its equipment and its provisions. Discipline in the ranks disintegrated. Most of the divisional generals left their posts, except for Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, Joseph Souham, Dominique Vandamme and Klein.Phipps, p. 62 In May, Andre Massena received overall command of both the Army of the Danube and the Army of Helvetia; Klein's column joined Massena near Zurich.Phipps, p. 97. In May 1799, Klein led a cavalry division of 2,010 prior to the Battle of Winterthur. A few days later, he commanded the cavalry reserve against the Archduke Charles and the Austrian army at the First Battle of Zurich. Charles' superior numbers and position forced the French to retreat from Zurich, taking up position on the western side of the Limmat River. In September, he again commanded the cavalry reserve, the VII. Division, of 3,696 on the left (west) bank of the Aar river. He was responsible for guarding the Frick valley (Fricktal).Phipps, pp. 129–133 There, as the dispositions developed for the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 September, Klein remained under direct command of Massena. Klein prepared to support either the troops of Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge or Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier, on the north or south flanks respectively, as required. The Austrian assault fell hardest on Mortier, who was driven back from the strategically placed Dietikon. Klein's reserve enabled the French to retake and hold the village. This convinced the Russian commander in Zurich, Alexander Korsakov, that he should draw his troops back to the city fortifications. Later, as Korsakoff relinquished these, the Russians executed a confused withdrawal to Constance. In the chaos, Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan's division, supported by Klein's reserve, pressed the Coalition forces hard at the west end of Constance, by the bridge to the abbey at Petershausen. They nearly captured the Prince Condé and the Duke d'Enghien themselves. Although the French took many prisoners, including many of the Army of Condé, the French emigrant army, these prisoners were not massacred whole-sale, as had happened after earlier battles. Klein and Mortier issued instructions, which were supported by Massena, that the émigrés be assigned Russian names—they were, after all, under Russian pay and wearing the Russian cockade in their caps--and treated with dignity; they were eventually exchanged for French officers held prisoner by the Austrians and Russians.Phipps, p. 159–161. Returning to France after the Peace of Lunéville in 1801, Klein remained inactive for several months. In 1802 he was recalled to military service as Inspector of Cavalry. He was given command of the 1st Division of Dragoons and in 1804 was made a Grand Officer of the Legion d'honneur. =Napoleonic Wars= In 1805, Klein's division was part of the newly created VIII. Corps, under command of Édouard Mortier; the role of the Corps was to patrol and secure the northern shore of the Danube river, limiting the Austro-Russian activity. Napoleon incorrectly assumed that the Russians and the Austrians would make a stand near St. Pölten, northwest of Vienna. Klein's entire regiment of dragoons patrolled the northern Danube shore, while the rest of his division, the last in the extended line of march, was more than a day behind Maxime Gazan's lead division.Robert Goetz. 1805: Austerlitz. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, 2005. , p. 76. Klein's division did not take part in the Battle of Dürenstein, although his dragoons were with Mortier and Gazan immediately prior to the engagement.Digby Smith. \\"Clash at Dürenstein\\", Napoleonic Wars Databook, p. 213. Klein's division was part of the decisive defeat of the Austrian and Russian force at the subsequent Battle of Austerlitz three weeks later. Initially, his dragoons, assigned to support Friant's division, occupied a position of observation on the Marchfeld.Goetz, p. 93. The rest of his dragoons remained near Stockerau, just to the west of Vienna, and these dragoons, plus Louis- Nicolas Davout's, François Antoine Louis Bourcier's and Marc Antoine Beaumont's divisions of dragoons, formed a cordon between Pohrlitz and Pressburg, and could move either west or east, depending on the actions of the Archduke Charles or the Russian commander Kutuzov.Goetz, p. 94. Consequently, Klein's dragoons, held the road between Austerlitz and Vienna, eliminating a possible Austrian retreat.Goetz, pp. 294–297. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Promotions & Awards *1777–1787, Guard of the Gate. *1792, First Lieutenant, 83rd Regiment, later 11th Chasseurs *1794, General of Brigade, Army of Sambre-et-Meuse *1799, General of Division, Army of the Danube *1802, Inspector General of Cavalry *1804, Legion of Honor *1805, Envoy, Grand Armeé *1807, Senator *1808, Governor of the Imperial Palace *1808-1809, Count of the Empire, Grand Cordon of the Order of the Bavarian Lion *1812, National Guard, Paris *1814-15, Peer of France, Order of St. Louis *1834, Grand Cross, Legion of Honor } In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Klein fought in the Grande Armée under command of Joachim Murat. After the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, Klein was with his division of dragoons in the village of Weissensee, the only escape route open to the Prussian General Blücher. Blücher was surprised to find Klein in possession of the village, but convinced him an armistice has been concluded between Prussia and Napoleon. Reports differ on the conduct of Klein and Blücher. William Milligan Sloane insists that Frederick William III of Prussia was with Blücher and that only the old general's bluff prevented the King's capture.Sloane William Milligan. The Life Of Napoleon Bonaparte. New York: Century, 1911, OCLC 10388397, Volume II, p. 436. Some historians assert that Klein believed him, and learned too late that he had been deceived. Others assert that Klein's force was too weak to resist the greater Prussian numbers. He had only 800 cavalry and Antoine Lasalle, to the west, had two regiments. Blücher had either 7,000, according to Charles Mullié, Charles Mullié. \\"Dominique Louis Antoine Klein.\\" Biographie des célébrités militaires des armées de terre et de mer de 1789 à 1850. 1851–52. or more than 12,000 Prussian infantry, artillery and horse. Regardless, Klein and Lasalle either pragmatically maintained the fiction or fell for the ruse; Blücher and his Prussians passed through the village.Francis Loraine Petre. Napoleon's Conquest of Prussia. London, John Lane; New York, John Lane Co., 1907, OCLC 1817897, pp. 196–200. Charles Mullié maintains that Klein vowed revenge; with his division, he pursued and attacked Blücher force the following day. He took 10 Prussian standards and 1,000 prisoners, including a general officer, although he did not capture Blücher. Frances Lorraine Petrie gives that credit to Soult, and so does Adolphe Thiers; furthermore, Petre maintains, Klein's dragoons were sent to guard the communications lines between Erfurt and Weimar, where several groups of Prussians had skirmished with the French rear guard.Petrie, p. 214. Adolphe Thiers. History of the consulate and the empire of France under Napoleon. D. Forbes Campbell and John Stebbing (trans.). London: Chatto & Windus; Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1893-1894, OCLC 12606477, vol. 4, p. 300. =Administrative and political duties= Following the Prussian campaign, Napoleon appointed Klein as governor of the Imperial palace. In 1807, Klein was called to the Senate. In 1808, he was raised by letters of patent to a count of the empire and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Bavarian Lion. In 1812, he was placed in command of the recruitment and training of a cohort of the National Guard. He remained in the Senate until April 1814, when he voted for Napoleon's abdication. In 1814, during the Bourbon Restoration, he was named a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He did not support Napoleon's return in the Hundred Days. In the Second Restoration, Louis XVIII raised him to the French peerage. Family and personal life Louis Klein was born on 25 January 1761 in Blâmont (Meurthe), in the Lorraine region.

The nucleus of the regiment was a battalion of six companies raised in September 1861 to garrison Fort Warren, the largest fortification in Boston harbor. The battalion was originally known as the 1st Battalion Massachusetts Infantry or the Fort Warren Battalion. The unit was transferred to the battle front following Abraham Lincoln's urgent call for troops in response to the Confederate advance on Washington during Jackson's Valley Campaign in May 1862. The Fort Warren Battalion arrived in Northern Virginia in June 1862 and, though it did not yet have a complete regimental roster of 10 companies, it then became known as the 32nd Regiment Massachusetts Infantry. In July 1862, the 32nd was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and was shipped to Fortress Monroe to join its new command at the close of the unsuccessful Peninsular Campaign. During the summer of 1862, four more companies were added to the unit and by September 3, 1862, the 32nd had a full regimental roster.Bowen, 481. The regiment took part in 30 battles overall including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Gettysburg, and numerous engagements during the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. In the Overland Campaign, during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the unit was heavily engaged and suffered 54 percent casualties--its worst casualties of the war.Bowen, 489. The composition of the 32nd Massachusetts was unusual in that it was continually replenished, during the latter months of the war, by men from disbanded regiments who had reenlisted for a second term of service. In all, remnants of seven different regiments were consolidated with the 32nd including the 9th, 12th, 13th, 18th, 22nd, and 39th Massachusetts Infantries.Bowen, 491 - 493. After the Confederate surrender, the 32nd Massachusetts participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., then returned to Boston and was disbanded on July 11, 1865.Bowen, 495.

Although recognition of previously-studied words through a recognition memory test, in which the words are re-presented for a memory judgment, generally yields a greater response probability than the recall of previously studied words through a recall test, in which the words must be mentally retrieved from memory, Tulving found that this typical result could be reversed by manipulating the retrieval cues provided at test. Tulving's procedure first tested the recognition memory of participants for a list of paired associates using an item recognition procedure, to which participants responded \\"yes\\" if the pair of items was valid and \\"no\\" if the pair was invalid. Next, the participants were given a recall test, in which they were shown one item in each pair and attempted to recall from memory the matching item. Tulving discovered that some items which participants had failed to recognize during the item recognition trials were recalled successfully during the subsequent recall test.Tulving, E., & Wiseman, S. (1975). Relation between recognition and recognition failure of recallable words. Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 92, 257-276. As an example of this effect, many people will fail to recognize the name \\"James Fenimore Cooper\\" if \\"Cooper\\" is presented as the cue, yet they will easily recall the author's surname if given the appropriate retrieval cue, \\"What is the author with first name James Fenimore?\\"Muter, P. (1978). Recognition failure of recallable words in semantic memory. Memory & Cognition, 6(1), 9-12. Although this example of recognition failure of recallable words occurs in semantic memory, Tulving has also demonstrated this phenomenon in episodic memory.Tulving, E. (1972). Episodic and semantic memory. In E. Tulving and W. Donaldson (Eds.), Organization of Memory (pp. 381-402). New York: Academic Press. Tulving and Wiseman also examined the association between recognition and cued recall for individual list items. The resulting Tulving-Wiseman function describes the correlation between the probability of recalling an item and the probability of recognizing the item conditional on recall having been successful.Tulving, E. & Flexser, A.J. (1992). On the Nature of the Tulving-Wiseman Function. Psychological Review, 99(3), 543-546. The function predicts a moderate correlation between recognition and cued recall, suggesting a need to distinguish between retrieval based on the familiarity of an item's specific properties and retrieval based on the recollection of relational information between two items.Yonelinas, A.P. (1997). Recognition memory ROCs for item and associative information: The contribution of recollection and familiarity. Memory & Cognition, 25(6), 747-763.Mandler, G. (1980) Recognizing: The judgment of previous occurrence. Psychological Review, 87,252-271. There is also some contradictory evidence that bases recognition failure on retrieval failure.

(2011). Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. Memory performance can be indicated by measuring the percentage of stimuli the participant was able to recall. An example of this would be studying a list of 10 words and later recalling 5 of them. This is a 50 percent recall. Participants' responses also may be analyzed to determine if there is a pattern in the way items are being recalled from memory. For example, if participants are given a list consisting of types of vegetables and types of fruit, their recall can be assessed to determine whether they grouped vegetables together and fruits together. Recall is also involved when a person is asked to recollect life events, such as graduating high school, or to recall facts they have learned, such as the capital of Florida. Measuring recall contrasts with measuring recognition, in which people are asked to pick an item that has previously been seen or heard from a number of other items that have not been previously seen or heard, which occurs, for example, during a typical multiple-choice question exam. __TOC__ Types of recall =Free recall test= Free recall is one of the most commonly used recall tests. In free recall tests participants are asked to study a list of words and then are asked to recall the words in whatever order they choose to recall them in. The words the participants are to recall are typically presented one at a time and for a short duration. The recalling of the words starts immediately after the final item being recalled is shown. The items can be listed either through verbal or written recall. Immediate recall of the items(Immediate Free Recall) is the most common form of free call tests, but recall of the items can be delayed(Delayed Free Recall). Both the immediate free recall and delayed free recall have been used to test the recency and primacy effects. Free recall is most often used to measure the number of items recalled from a list. Murdock in an experiment on serial position effects, used six groups of 103 participants. Each group was given different combinations of list lengths and presentation rates. Three of the groups were shown lists of ten, fifteen, and twenty words with a presentation rate of two seconds per word. The other three groups were shown lists of twenty, thirty, and forty words with a one-second presentation rate for each word. There were eighty lists in total that included randomly selected common English words. After the presentation of each list, subjects were asked to recall as many words as possible in any order. Results from the experiment showed that all groups expressed both primacy effects and recency effects. Recency effects were exhibited regardless of the length of the list, and it was strongest for the words in the last eight serial positions. The primacy effect extended over the first four serial positions. Serial recall paradigm is a form of free recall where the participants have to list the items presented to them in the correct order they are presented in. Research shows that the learning curve for serial recall increases linearly with every trial. Bruno, Miller, and Zimmerman (1955) in an experiment tested to learn why the serial recall learning curve increases linearly. They were testing to see if this linear increase is a result of the order in which the participant sees the items, or if it is instead dependent on the order in which the participant is told to recall the items. The study involved three different conditions: serial recall, free recall with items to be recalled randomized before each trial, and free recall with the order of the items kept constant. The experiment tested nine college students on 18 series of words. In addition to the linear serial recall learning curve, it was found that more words are forgotten when recall is free than when it is serial. This study also supported the notion that the difference between the types of recall depends on the order in which the learner must recall the items, and not on the order in which the items are presented. =Cued recall test= A cued recall test is a procedure for testing memory in which a participant is presented with cues, such as words or phrases, to aid recall of previously experienced stimuli. Endel Tulving and Zena Pearlstone (1966) conducted an experiment in which they presented participants with a list of words to be remembered. The words were from specific categories such as birds (pigeon, sparrow), furniture (chair, dresser), and professions (engineer, lawyer). The categories were not made apparent in the original list. Participants in the free recall group were asked to write down as many words as they could remember from the list. Participants in the cued recall group were also asked to recall the words, but this group was provided with the names of the categories, \\"birds\\", \\"furniture\\", and \\"professions\\". The results of Tulving and Pearlstone's experiment demonstrate that retrieval cues aid memory. Participants in the free recall group recalled 40 percent of the words, whereas participants in the cued recall group recalled 75 percent of the words.  Factors affecting recall  =Encoding specificity= The principle of encoding specificity states that we encode information along with its context. The memory utilizes cues from which the information was encoded and from the environment in which it is being retrieved. An experiment demonstrating encoding specificity was conducted by D. R. Godden and Alan Baddeley (1975) in their \\"diving experiment\\". During this experiment, one group of participants studied a list of words underwater while another group of participants studied the same list of words on land. These groups were then divided, so half of the participants in the land and water groups were tested for recall on land and half were tested underwater. The participants demonstrated a better recall when the context of retrieval matched the context of encoding, for example having studied underwater and being tested underwater. =State-dependent learning= This is another example of how matching the conditions at the encoding and retrieval can influence memory. State-dependent learning is associated with a specific internal state, such as mood or state of awareness. According to the principle of state-dependent learning, memory will be better when a person's internal state during retrieval matches his or her internal state during encoding. Two ways of matching encoding and retrieval include matching the physical situation (encoding specificity) or an internal feeling (state- dependent learning). =Transfer-appropriate processing= Transfer -appropriate processing (TAP) shows that our ability to recall information well is not only dependent on the depth at which we learn it. It shows that how we connect the information and build relationships with other encoded memories is important in being able to recall the information. Schendan and Kutas (2007) performed an experiment in which they confirmed that recall of memories is best when we match the situations. They found that significantly more memory can be recalled when what has been learned is grouped together and paired with what the sensory information is saying was learned Franks, and colleagues performed thirteen experiments on TAP and found that memory is best enhanced when the learning situation was matched to the retrieval situation. =Levels of processing theory= The idea behind the levels of processing theory is that the depth of processing effects how well you encode the information you are learning. Craik and Tulving performed a study in 1975 where the participants were presented a list of 60 words each word having three questions. The questions varied from requiring them to think about the word to just remembering what they saw. Craik and Tulving discovered that the words that required deeper processing were remembered best. Craik and Tulving also discovered that the more familiar the stimulus is recalling the information is increased. The reason for this being when a stimulus is presented is familiar it already has many connections to memories that have been encoded. These connections to the encoded memories strengthens the memory of the stimulus being presented. Levels of processing theory goes even further to show that recall is increased when asked to remember in the way it was originally presented to us.  References  2\\\\. Goldstein, E.B. (2015).

Established by the Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company to house woodland workers and their families, Camp Robinson was named in honor of Mr. RHM Robinson, the then President of the company. The camp had over 30 homes that were four room bungalows which were first painted green. These small houses created low rent homes for the company's workers and their families. A two-room school was built to house 50 students overseen by Mr. Edwin Sweet, teacher/principal. Mr. Sweet was assisted by Mrs. Iola Seed. Eventually, a bakery, butcher shop, a laundry, a small infirmary with a registered nurse were all located in the camp. For entertainment, the camp had its own curling rink and baseball diamond and for spiritual needs: a church. The camp had its own power generation using large diesel powered generator sets. The company's woodland garage was located in the camp to service all the equipment from surrounding woodlands operations. The camp even had its own sewage system. Camp Robinson was in existence for over 30 years until its demise in 1980. The end for the camp was in the works since the takeover of the company by Boise Cascade, as they had planned to replace the workers (represented by the Lumber and Sawmill Union) with independent owner operators of log skidding equipment. The eventual announcement caused a strike to start in 1978 and the last family, Beverley and Stanley Sandmoen, left the camp in 1980. The camp was leveled and buried by Boise Cascade and trees were planted over the site.

His work can be seen as a critique of some of Modernity's founding principles like truth. Koppensteiner argues that the autonomous and self grounded subject, morals or solvability of conflicts have become sites of contestation and debate. He suggests to re-think some of those categories being debated in (post)modernity by invoking transpersonal and transrational transpositions. Asking about the continued possibilities for subjectivation, Koppensteiner sketches the outlines of an art of living for a subjectivity perceived as constantly emergent and in transformation, a subjectivity that dares to embrace conflict as part of its transpersonal relational becoming and that emerges through an ongoing transformation of the self understood as an aesthetic (Apollonian) and energetic (Dionysian) practice. The strictly relational understanding of peaces and conflict that Koppensteiner proposes is one of the central ontological assumptions of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies. Other important representatives of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies are Josefina Echavarría (Research and Publications Coordinator), Daniela Ingruber (Coordinator MA Program), Jennifer Murphy and Andreas Oberprantacher. Each academic year leading international scholars of Peace and Conflict Studies visit the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program at the University of Innsbruck. = Transrational Peace Philosophy = The Innsbruck School of Peace Studies is based on Wolfgang Dietrich's transrational approach to Peace Studies and is outlined in his Many Peaces Trilogy. Spanning continents as well as disciplines, Dietrich presents a panorama of diverse interpretations of peace in world history and culture. In a journey through time and space, Dietrich outlines the so-called five families of peace - energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans- rational. He stresses the importance of combining rationality and reason with human properties such as emotion and spirituality in applied peace work. This ontological assumption indicates a paradigm shift and proposes a new epistemological understanding of peace, which is at the heart of the Innsbruck School's peace philosophy. = Elicitive Conflict Transformation = Elicitive Conflict Transformation was first introduced to the field by John Paul Lederach in 1995 and is the applied method of transrational peace philosophy. Drawing on the debate on multi-track diplomacy, Lederach initially distinguished between three levels of conflict: # Top Leaders # Middle-Range Leaders # Grassroots Wolfgang Dietrich draws on Lederach's systemic approach to conflict and developed a multi-layered model of conflict analysis. Furthermore, he systematizes elective conflict transformation techniques in three main groups: # Voice Oriented Approaches to Conflict Transformation; e.g. non-violent communication after Marshall Rosenberg and Theme-Centered Interaction after Ruth Cohn. # Body-oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. Theatre for Living after David Diamond, Butho- and Five Rhythms Dance, after Gabrielle Roth # breath oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. Holotropic Breathwork after Stanislav Grof and Sylvester Walch. All three types of approaches to conflict share a strong reference to systems theory and hence a strictly relational understanding of conflicts. = Elicitive Conflict Mapping = Elicitive Conflict Mapping is a brand-new tool that has been developed at the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies. By bringing together the theoretical and academic building blocks of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies in a didactical format, with special emphasis on the graphic components, ECM aims to support those in search of: * Understanding and clarifying the conflict episode * Visibilizing the conflict parties * Viewing the conflict dynamics at different levels and through different layersUNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): Elicitive Conflict Mapping Available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ecm/, last accessed November 19, 2014.  Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies  In January 2017 the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was inaugurated at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences. The Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies consists of the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies, which is the rooftop for a large number of research and cooperation projects and the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation. = UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies = The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies of the University of Innsbruck was established in June 2008 as a consequence of the systematic research on the interpretations of peaces and the unique approach to peace studies as developed by Innsbruck's MA program for Peace Studies since 2001. The agreement has been signed between the UNESCO, represented by its Director-General Koichiro Matsuura, and the University of Innsbruck, represented by its rector Karlheinz Töchterle. In the light of the excellent results achieved and confirmed by the positive evaluation of the report on its activities, UNESCO renewed in February 2015 the 2008 agreement concerning the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck until June 2019. According to the agreement the main purposes of the UNESCO Chair are: # the promotion of an integrated system of research, training, information and documentation in the field of peace studies; # the facilitation of collaboration between high-level, internationally recognized researchers and teaching staff of the University and other institutions in Austria, in Europe and North America, and other regions of the world; # the reinforcement of the existing network of cooperating partners through further regional, as well as international, cooperation; # the enhancement and complement of the already existing on-line teaching methods; # the exchange of professors, researchers, and students with other universities within the framework of UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme. = The MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Studies = Founded in 2002, the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation has become a leading Masters Program, training the next generation of Peace and Conflict Studies scholars and Conflict Workers. In its didactical approach the program follows a relational approach to conflict of elective conflict transformation, which is conveyed to the students in theory and practice. After the successful completion of an MA thesis students are awarded the academic title Master of Arts (120 ECTS Credit Points). The first UNESCO Chairholder Professor Wolfgang Dietrich is the third academic director of the MA Program, following Prof. Anton Pelinka and Prof. Alan Scott in this function. = Unit for Peace Studies Alumni Network = Established in 2008, a vast amount of alumni initiatives have emerged within the active network of graduates from the MA Program in Peace and Conflict Studies. Amongst others this includes the Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces, the Many Peaces Magazine, the Peace Fund and the Many Peaces e.V..  Many Peaces Festival  The Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces is an international peace and conflict studies conference, facilitating a dialogue amongst scholars engaged within the field of transrational peace philosophy, as well as practitioners, within the field of elective conflict transformation. The 1st Innsbruck Academic Festival took place between August 9 and 14 2015 at the Grillhof Seminar Center in Innsbruck, Austria.  Many Peaces Magazine The Many Peaces Magazinehttp://magazine.manypeaces.org was conceptualized and launched in 2014 by Adham Hamed, Mayme Lefurgey, Paul Lauer and Isabelle Guibert. It was created as an outlet to showcase the work of alumni, students, cooperation partners and friends of the Master of Arts Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation and the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies located at Universität Innsbruck, Austria. The magazine is published twice a year, in January and July of each year. The Many Peaces Magazine team has changed and developed over the past volumes and is currently coordinated by a team spread out over three continents and features authors and stories from around the globe. Many of the articles, stories and contributions that can be found in the magazine relate to the field of Peace Studies in some way, but more specifically to the fields of Transrational Peace Philosophy and Elicitive Conflict Transformation. = List of Volumes = # A Magazine for Many Peaces (1/2015) # The Art of Living Sideways: Skateboarding and Peaces (2/2015) # Joking for Peaces: Theatre in Conflict Transformation (1/2016) # Revolutionary Moments (2/2016) # Gender and Peace Building (1/2017) # Healing and Conflict Transformation (2/2018) # Peace Education (1/2018) # Violence and Peace Work (2/2018)  Peace Studies Fund e.V.

S. Venkataraman (1918-1994), popularly known as CSV, was a mathematician from Kerala, India. He specialised in the theory of numbers, and his forte was the theory of arithmetic functions. Known to his friends as CSV, Venkataraman was born at Chelakkara, a small village in Thrissur District of Kerala, India, on 14 September 1918 as the son of late C V Subbarama Iyer, who too was a professor of mathematics at the University College, Trivandrum, for a long time and later as the principal in 1951. After his early education in his native village and in Trivandrum, he had his higher education at the Presidency College, Chennai, where he had the opportunity of studying under the eminent K. Ananda Rau, who was a contemporary and a friend of Ramanujan and a student of Hardy at University of Cambridge. Naturally, CSV got the inspiration to become a mathematician from his great professor, Ananda Rau, and also, he got an opportunity to get introduced to another mathematical genius R. Vaidyanathaswamy, who had already established himself at the University of Madras in the 1930s and had set up a tradition and an academic atmosphere that gave Madras an international recognition in the field of mathematics. CSV was selected as a research scholar in the Department of Mathematics of Madras University to do research in Theory of Arithmetic function under the guidance of R Vaidyanathaswamy. In fact, there he was in the eminent company of senior research scholars like P Kesava Menon and K G Ramanathan and the theory of multiplicative function formed the material for the dissertations of P Kesava Menon and CSV. The theory of arithmetic functions was initiated in the 1930s by E. T. Bell of the California Institute of Technology and independently by R Vaidyanathaswamy. CSV expounded the theory in a series of remarkable research papers which soon became a classic and CSV was awarded the Ph.D. degree by the University of Madras in 1952 for his \\"Contributions to the Theory of Multiplicative Functions\\". During the work leading to the award of Ph.D. degree, he derived a new identity for multiplicative functions of two variables. Vaidyanathaswami’s identity for multiplicative functions which appeared in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1931 could be deduced from that of CSV's. In view of his contributions to the theory of numbers, CSV was nominated for a visiting professorship at the University of North Carolina, Durham, NC, US. This was for possible collaboration with Leonard Carlitz, who came to know about CSV's research interest. Though CSV wanted to continue with full-time research, some sudden turn of events in his family circumstances forced him to be near his home town and hence he accepted an offer of a lectureship at Union Christian College, Aluva. After spending a brief time there, he joined the Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, in 1947, where he remained as a professor till retirement. The college he chose to serve had no pretensions of being in the elite league of colleges in Kerala, and it was usually dubbed as a common man's college. Because of his passion for research and teaching, CSV also did not accept the post of the principal of the college, a position which was offered to him at a very young age. Due to CSV’s active interest in research, the Department of Mathematics of Sree Kerala Varma College was recognized as a research centre for mathematics by the University of Kerala in 1961. A.C. Vasu and R. Sivaramakrishnan were his doctoral students. He was a member of Indian Mathematical Society ever since 1945. Mathematicians all over India knew CSV, and it was CSV who represented Kerala at conferences and meetings for a long time. On account of his professional and academic achievements, his name finds, justifiably, a place in the World Directory of Mathematicians published in 1986 under the auspices of the International Mathematical Union. He was a towering personality in the realm of higher mathematics in Kerala for more than three decades. Kerala has produced some world-class number theorists, among whom CSV occupies a pride of place along with his predecessors Sivasankarnarayana Pillai (whom Hardy described as Ramanujan's worthy successor) and P Kesava Menon. Ramanujan Mathematical Society has instituted an annual endowment lecture in his honour. Tall, erect, well–dressed and with keen, searching eyes, CSV had a magnetic personality with his very fair complexion and handsome charming appearance and used to be called \\"Lord Mountbatten\\" by the colleagues and students in his heyday. CSV died on 16 March 1994.

Located northwest of the unincorporated community of Oregonia in northwestern Washington Township, Warren County, the cemetery is composed of an uncertain number of graves of individuals from the Fort Ancient culture of Native Americans.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. Graves at the site are composed of bodies contained within limestone stone box graves. A cemetery of this type from the Fort Ancient period is very uncommon, making the Stone Graves a valuable archaeological site. Increasing the significance of the area is a complex of other nearby Fort Ancient sites, including the Bone Mound II that is only away. Because most Fort Ancient sites include only a single type of burials, rather than both a mound and a cemetery, it is believed that the vicinity of the Stone Graves may have been inhabited by people of two different foci. In the future, more information may be gained from the cemetery, for the site has never been subject to an archaeological excavation. On July 15, 1974, the Bone Stone Graves were listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of their archaeological value. The Bone Mound II was listed on the Register on the same day.

He started his military career in the Old Regime army, served on the staffs of three of the early army commanders, later fought in the War of the Pyrenees against the Kingdom of Spain. On three separate occasions he commanded the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, but he shared the fate of two previous commanders when he was arrested and guillotined by the Committee of Public Safety. Early career Son of Eustache Jean-Marie D'Aoust, who later became a member of the National Convention, Eustache Charles d'Aoust began his military career as a second lieutenant supernumerary without pay in the Royal Regiment of Infantry on 21 April 1778 at the age of 15. He became sous-lieutenant on 14 April 1782, second lieutenant on 23 April 1786, and first lieutenant on 16 August 1789. D'Aoust was appointed aide-de-camp to Marshal Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau on 26 May 1790. He became captain and adjutant to Marshal Nicolas Luckner on 21 May 1792. He became aide-de-camp to General Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duc de Biron on 13 July 1792, and received promotion to colonel on 7 October.French Wikipedia, Eustache Charles d'Aoust Eastern Pyrenees D'Aoust was provisionally appointed general of brigade in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees on 2 June 1793. He was provisionally appointed general of division by representatives Joseph Fabre and Reymond Gaston on 7 August, and assumed command of the camp near Perpignan. This was a difficult time to be a general in the eastern Pyrenees. The Spanish army captured the Fort de Bellegarde, a major fortress, when the siege ended on 24 June. Previous commander Claude Souchon de Chameron was in prison and Louis-Charles de Flers joined him when he was arrested on 6 August. Both Souchon and de Flers were guillotined in 1794 during the Reign of Terror. To make matters worse, the Spanish commander Captain General Antonio Ricardos was a capable opponent. Believing that Ricardos' Spanish army was unstoppable, Hilarion Paul de Puget- Barbantane moved his headquarters well to the rear on 4 September 1793, putting d'Aoust in charge of Perpignan. On 11 September, Barbantane fled to Toulouse, leaving the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees without a commander. The army briefly separated into three independent divisions and d'Aoust took command of the 1st Division. On 17 September, d'Aoust won a significant victory at the Battle of Peyrestortes. He led his troops in an attack on Juan de Courten's 6,000 Spanish soldiers at the Camp of Vernet. Other French troops under Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet attacked Peyrestortes hill, where Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarilas deployed his division. After heavy fighting that lasted into the night, the French inflicted a major defeat on their opponents. Spanish killed, wounded, and captured numbered at least 1,702, and 26 cannon were captured. More importantly, the Spanish never seriously threatened Perpignan again.Smith, pp 56-57Prats, Peyrestortes On 18 August, d'Aoust became subordinated to Luc Siméon Auguste Dagobert, the new army commander. A few days after the French defeat at the Battle of Truillas on 22 September, Dagobert was arrested and d'Aoust became the army commander. On 3 October, d'Aoust with 16,000 men engaged Ricardos and 15,000 Spanish troops at Le Boulou on the Tech River. The Spanish won the battle, inflicting losses 400 killed and 800 wounded on their enemies, while suffering only 300 casualties. During and after the battle, 1,500 French soldiers deserted.Smith, p 57 Between 11 October and 21 November, Louis Marie Turreau became the new army commander and d'Aoust went back to command the 1st Division. D'Aoust temporarily led the army again from 22 to 27 November until the inept but politically influential François Amédée Doppet took command from 28 November to 20 December. On 7 December, d'Aoust advanced with 10,000 troops to surprise the enemy camp at Villelongue-dels-Monts. Ricardos with 3,000 Spanish and 5,000 Portuguese soldiers, repulsed the French attack. The French counted 340 killed and wounded, and 312 missing. In addition, 26 cannon, 2 colors, and 2,000 muskets were captured by the Allies. The Allies reported only 56 casualties.Smith, p 63 Execution Although he again assumed temporary army command on 21 December, he was recalled to Paris the next day. On 2 January 1794, Representatives Jacques Cassanyès and Gaston confirmed him as army commander. But his doom was sealed when he was arrested by order of Representatives Édouard Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany on 10 January 1794. He was also denounced by his jealous rivals, Turreau and Doppet.Prats, Banyuls Accused of malice and disability, d'Aoust was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court. He was guillotined in Paris on 2 July 1794 at the age of 31 years. Footnotes References =Printed materials= * Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. * Six, Georges.

Opposition to construction The project was opposed by some of the property owners whose land was needed for the development. A group of ten owners sued the City of Alabaster and Colonial Properties to prevent the controversial use of eminent domain to force them to sell approximately 10 of the 400 acres needed. In June 2003, the Alabaster City Council voted 6–0 (with 1 abstention) to adopt the I-65, 238 Urban Renewal and Urban Redevelopment Plan which determined that the property in question was a \\"blighted area\\". The city subsequently entered into an agreement to condemn and seize the land, and then exchange it and certain infrastructure improvements for the construction of new facilities to be provided by Shelby Land Partners, a limited-liability corporation established to negotiate with the city for the development. At the time, Wal-Mart and Belk had already been announced as prospective tenants. Lily Spence, a landowner whose property had been condemned for the development, appeared on CNN to voice her objections to having her property condemned and to the price offered. The case was cited by Alabama state legislators who passed legislation severely restricting the scope of public uses allowed in eminent domain cases. The July 2005 law followed a Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London, a Connecticut dispute, that the matter was for states to decide.

Its studios and transmitter are located at the Superior School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (ESIME) Culhuacán. History Radio IPN traces its roots to 1984, when it was conceived as a teaching and instructional tool for students in the communications and electrical engineering programs. At that time, the IPN applied to the SCT in order to obtain a permit for the station and to begin intermittent operations on 95.7 MHz, which was issued on February 25, 1987. Located at the Unidad Profesional Culhuacán, it was given the call letters XHUPC-FM. On September 5, 1994, XHUPC began offering regular programming 13 hours a day, five days a week. The station was known as \\"El Politécnico en Radio\\". In 1995, it added weekend programs, and 1997 saw XHUPC move to 24-hour operation. In 2017, an administrative overhaul occurred at XHUPC as the result of the adoption of new bylaws governing the station. The change also saw new outside leadership be brought in. In November 2017, according to former station employees, the locks were changed. Said employees issued an open letter in which they decried the new leadership, hailing from Radio UNAM and UAM Radio, and the fact that an IPN alumnus was not leading the station, as had been the case during the more than 20-year leadership tenure of Ing. José Ramos Subirachs. They also declared that administration was seeking to \\"kidnap IPN culture\\". The new administration made the station more institutional in nature and rebranded it as \\"Radio IPN\\". On March 7, 2019, the Federal Telecommunications Institute approved the change of the station's call letters to XHIPN-FM, in order to increase identification of the radio station with the IPN.RPC: #036321 Change in Call Letters — XHIPN-FM (formerly XHUPC-FM Programming Radio IPN tower and antenna XHIPN carries a wide variety of cultural programs, ranging from the station's own productions to programs supplied by Radio France International, as well as the audio of Once Noticias newscasts.

He played both finals matches against Emelec, scoring in the second leg, winning the game 1-0 in the final minutes, and helped Quito become 2011 league champions. 2012 Season Alustiza had a great 2012 season with Deportivo Quito, most notably in the 2012 Copa Libertadores, becoming joint-top goal-scorer next to Santos FC's Neymar Da Silva, scoring 8 goals. His first goal in the Copa Libertadores campaign came against Chivas de Guadalajara in a 1-1 away draw. Next was a single penalty scored by Alustiza in a 3-0 home win against Velez Sarsfield. His most notable participation in the tournament came in a home win against Chivas, in an emphatic 5-0 win, with Matías scoring 4 goals. Alustiza was given the match-ball for his 4 goals by the referee. Alustiza scored his final goals against Universidad de Chile. Matías Alustiza was then sold to Mexican club Puebla FC. =Puebla FC= On June 28, 2012 Puebla FC announced via their official Facebook page that they had signed Matías Alustiza and will be taking part in the Apertura 2012 and the Copa Mexico Apertura 2012. In the Apertura 2012, Matias scored his first goal in the third round against Santos Laguna where he scored twice. In the Clausura 2013 Copa MX Matias was runner up score leader with 7 goals in 6 games. On May 15, 2013 Puebla FC bought 50% of the players contract from Ecuadorian club Quito and signed a 2-year extension that kept him at Puebla until 2015. =CF Pachuca= In June 2014, it was announced that CF Pachuca bought Alustiza from Puebla. On July 19 he made his debut with a goal for the win against Cruz Azul. On August 23, he scored a hat-trick against Atlas. In 2015, he returned to Puebla FC. He back to Puebla in 2019 Style of play A creative forward, Alustiza has good vision, passing, shot, ball control, dribbling skills and speed. Despite his small size, he can finish goals with the head. His presence on the pitch have good effect on his team's general performance. While his favored position is that of a second striker, he can also play as a lone striker and attacking midfielder.

She was the accompanist for the Festival Singers of Canada under Dr. Elmer Iseler for many years, where she developed her ear for composing mixed-choral works. Henderson also accompanied the Toronto Children's Chorus under Jean Ashworth Bartle from its inception in 1978 to 2007 and was music director for Kingsway Lampton United Church in Toronto from 1996 to 2013. An associate of the Canadian Music Centre, Watson Henderson's compositional output includes works for organ, piano, violin, trumpet, string orchestra, and more than 200 choral pieces. Her works are known for their use of modal and impressionistic harmonies. In 1989 her Chromatic Partita for Organ won a prize in an International Competition for Women Composers in Mannheim, Germany. In 1992 her Voices of Earth won the National Choral Award for Outstanding Choral Composition. In 1996 she received the Distinguished Service Award of the Ontario Choral Federation. Many of her works have been recorded and enjoy international popularity. Additionally, Canadian choirs often perform entire concerts of her compositions. Life and career Born Ruth Louise Watson in Toronto, Watson Henderson studied the piano with Viggo Kihl from 1937-1945. She then entered The Royal Conservatory of Music where she studied from 1945–1952 and earned an associates diploma in 1949 and a licentiate diploma in 1951. Her piano teacher there was Alberto Guerrero. She also studied composition privately with Oskar Morawetz, Samuel Dolin and Richard Johnston. From 1952-1954 she studied piano at the Mannes College of Music in New York City with Hans Neumann (pianist). Watson Henderson made her professional concert debut in 1952 in Toronto and quickly became active as a solo concert pianist with symphony orchestras throughout Canada. She also played with some frequency on CBC Radio. In 1956 she won the grand prize on the CBC radio talent show Opportunity Knocks. After this, she moved to Manitoba where she lived in Winnipeg until 1961. After a few years in Kitchener, she returned to Toronto where she still resides. While she was the accompanist for the Festival Singers of Canada she began to compose choral music, including her 'Missa Brevis.' Later large works influenced by her experience in working with fine choirs include 'Voices of Earth' and 'From Darkness to Light.' When she was the accompanist for the Toronto Children's Chorus, she wrote many compositions for children's voices, including Clear Sky and Thunder, a music- drama about Inuit children, which the TCC premiered in 1984 and 'The Last Straw' which featured tenor Ben Heppner in 1990.

They were the only trams in use on the network until the entry into service of British Rail Class 399 tram-trains in 2017. As of May 2020, all 25 Siemens-Duewag vehicles remain operational. History On street running at the Middlewood terminus After undergoing trials on Düsseldorf's Rheinbahn system, the trams were delivered to Sheffield via the Rotterdam- Immingham cargo ship route. The trams are bidirectional and consist of three articulated carriages with a low-floor area of 40%. All four entrances are at 42 cm low level matching the height of the platforms to provide level access. The low-floor areas have limited seating and provide space for pushchairs and wheel chairs. The high floor areas are 88 cm high and can be found at the outer-end of each end carriage and in the centre carriage; they are reached by either two or three steps. Because the Supertram network includes gradients up to 10%, all vehicle axles are powered, which limits the low-floor area to that between the bogies. For maximized low floor area, the middle bogies are installed entirely below the centre carriage section rather than under the articulations. The wheels are type Bochum 84, have resilient rubber inserts and have a diameter of 67 cm. They may be worn to a diameter of at least 59 cm. There are four monomotor bogies, each powered by a longitudinally suspended motor driving both axles. The power supply is 750 volts DC from overhead lines using a Brecknell Willis high reach pantograph. Speed is controlled from the cab by a joystick controller with a Dead man's switch, which must be held in place to keep the track brakes from automatically applying. No other vigilance control is fitted, because of the perceived safety of a system of street-running trams. Drivers are seated on sprung seats for comfort and a PA system allows them to communicate with passengers. The vehicle interior is designed to meet safety requirements. The interior fittings have no sharp edges to prevent any injury and there are numerous grab rails for standing passengers. The interior lining of the ceiling consists of aluminium honeycomb bonded with melamine coloured resin. The lining is attached to suspension points welded to the roof section. The inside walls are made from coloured melamine material. The complete lining for the articulations consists of coloured fibreglass. The rear wall of the driving cab is made of laminated wood with a melamine veneer. Passengers have 86 upholstered seats, mostly arranged face to face. The low floor areas possess minimum seating to provide space for wheelchairs in accordance with the requirements of the DPTAC. Studies were carried out by the Cranfield Institute of Technology to ensure that all members of the public may have access to the vehicles. From September 2005, the trams' manual destination boards were changed to multicolour LED signs conforming with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), whilst pre-recorded next stop announcements were introduced to replace announcements made by drivers. Three voices with local accents were chosen to record the destination messages on the three different tram lines. All trams were refurbished between January 2006 and February 2009, with the first refurbished tram being launched at Supertram's Nunnery depot on 27 January 2006. The refurbishment bought the trams to conform to the Disability Discrimination Act inside, whilst also repainting the trams into new Stagecoach corporate colours, finished in a blue livery similar to that of South West Trains. In May 2009 the second part of the refresh programme began, which was an overhaul of the tram's under-floor running equipment. It lasted until the end of 2012 and meant that one tram was once again permanently unavailable for service, and the system therefore continued to operate with 23 trams out of an 'available for service' fleet of 25. Liveries The initial tram livery was overall light grey with a dark blue skirt,Image gallery of the trams on launch week and Supertram fleetnames. A minor modification appeared just prior to the Stagecoach Group rebranding, when the current motto was added to the centre car in large letters under the windows. Following the Stagecoach being awarded the operating franchise in 1997, the trams were rebranded into the corporate Stagecoach identity, a white base with three stripes, with a Stagecoach fleet name and SUPERTRAM strapline, in line with their UK bus fleet. Later, as the bus fleets were given a new livery, a dark blue base was added under the orange, red and blue stripes. Bluebell & snowdrop livery inspired by the Prussian blue and cream livery of Sheffield Tramway Between January 2006 and January 2009 the entire fleet was refurbished internally as part of the 'refresh programme'. In parallel, the tram livery was rebranded to the current scheme, a predominantly blue livery and more prominent logo and a smaller subordinate Stagecoach identifier. This was loosely based on the blue version of the South West Trains corporate Stagecoach livery. Before and after images of the refresh are available on the operator's website. In addition to the standard liveries, a number of all over advertising schemes have been used on individual trams for places such as the Meadowhall Centre,Meadowhall liveried purple tramMeadowhall liveried blue tram a jobs website, sister Stagecoach company East Midlands Trains, the new Sheffield IKEA store, Doncaster Sheffield Airport, XPO Logistics and fashion website PrettyLittleThing. Since 2010, tram 120 has featured a non-standard livery to mark the 50th anniversary of the closure of the former tram network and to celebrate the influence of the trams on the city. The design featured a similar blue and cream colour as were used on the original Sheffield Tramway, the Sheffield City Coat of Arms and removal of the external advertisements.

The crises are commonly reckoned to be the start of the Cold War in Western Europe.Maxwell Adereth, The French Communist Party, a Critical History (Manchester University Press, 1984), p.144-146 In Italy, the Christian Democrats (DC), led by Alcide De Gasperi, were losing popularity, and feared that the leftist coalition would take power. The Communist Party of Italy (PCI) was growing particularly fast due to its organizing efforts supporting sharecroppers in Sicily, Tuscany and Umbria, movements which were also bolstered by the reforms of Fausto Gullo, the Communist minister of agriculture.Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy, pp. 106–113 On 1 May, the nation was thrown into crisis by the murder of eleven leftist peasants (including four children) at an International Workers' Day parade in Palermo by Salvatore Giuliano and his gang. In the political chaos which ensued, the president engineered the expulsion of all left-wing ministers from the cabinet on 31 May. The PCI would not have a national position in government again for twenty years. De Gasperi did this under pressure from US Secretary of State George Marshall, who'd informed him that anti-communism was a pre-condition for receiving American aid,James Ciment, Encyclopedia of Conflicts Since World War II (Routledge, 2015)Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy, pp. 106–113 and Ambassador James C. Dunn who had directly asked de Gasperi to dissolve the parliament and remove the PCI. In France, conflicting policies of members of the governing Tripartisme coalition created tensions, and economic conditions were dire under the presidency of Paul Ramadier. The French Communist Party (PCF) had the support of one in every four voters, polling the largest percentage of votes of any party between 1946 and 1956.John Ashley Soames Grenville, A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century (Psychology Press, 2005), p. 514 Ramadier received warnings from the US Ambassador Jefferson Caffery that the presence of Communists in the government would lead to the blocking of American aid, or perhaps worse. (\\"I told Ramadier,\\" Caffery wrote in his diary, \\"no Communists in gov. or else.\\")Melvyn Leffler, The Preponderance of Power (Stanford University Press, 1992), p.157-58 Ramadier began looking for a pretext to purge them. As the great French strikewave of 1947 began, a rumor circulated among the ministers in Ramadier's party, the SFIO, that the Communists were plotting a coup for 1 May, and the military was secretly mobilized.R.W. Johnson, The Long March of the French Left (Springer, 1981), p.30-31 The Communist ministers opposed Ramadier in a vote on wages policies, and, on 5 May 1947, he expelled them from the government. The following year, the US rewarded France with hundreds of millions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid.Martin Evans, Emmanuel Godin, France Since 1815, Second Edition (Routledge, 2014), p.134-136 No evidence of coup plot was ever found, and it was confirmed that the PCF had initially opposed the April strikes. The Communist Party's absence from government in France lasted well beyond the fall of the Fourth Republic, and the effect of this absence upon the party system and the stability of government have prompted historians such as Maynard Williams to describe 5 May 1947 as 'the most important date in the history of the Fourth Republic'.Williams, Crisis and Compromise, pg. 26 The Italian political crisis and anti-communist movement were dependent on Mafia violence. The Mafia made deep connections with the Christian Democrats in the mid-1940s through figures such as Calogero Vizzini, who was also an operative for the US military. The politicized Mafia employed terror as a tactic against the labor movement and the Communist Party, killing dozens of leftists in this period. The 1 May massacre by Salvatore Giuliano is often alleged to be one of these Christian Democrat-associated events.James Cockayne, Hidden Power: The Strategic Logic of Organized Crime (Oxford University Press)Tim Newark, Boardwalk Gangster: The Real Lucky Luciano (Macmillan, 2011), Chapter 14 \\"Cold War Warrior\\" According to Peter Robb, \\"The mafia had commissioned the crime for the politicians...just as it was picking off individual communists, socialists, and trade unionists. Another dozen had been killed that same year of 1947...The mafia was making itself useful to its new political protectors by dispatching its enemies, a pattern that was to continue for decades.\\" Prior to his mysterious killing in state custody, Guiliano lieutenant Gaspare Pisciotta implicated the DC directly for the massacre through Ministry of the Interior Mario Scelba.Peter Robb, Midnight In Sicily: On Art, Feed, History, Travel and la Cosa Nostra (Macmillan/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2014) Writers such as Gaia Servadio and Peter Dale Scott believe there was US involvement through an intelligence-mafia network run by William J. Donovan.Douglas Valentine The Strength of the Wolf: The Secret History of America's War on Drugs (Verso, 2013) While specific accusations are controversial, there is consensus that Giuliano \\"was being used as a vanguard in a domestic political battle with the Communists.\\" James Cockayne, Hidden Power: The Strategic Logic of Organized Crime (Oxford University Press) Communist ministers were dismissed from several other European governments in 1947 and in all cases the move was dictated by a desire to comply with the wishes of the United States.Maxwell Adereth, The French Communist Party, a Critical History (Manchester University Press, 1984), p.146-147 These maneuvers led the Soviets to harden their approach to foreign policy, establishing the Cominform. At the same time as Communist ministers were being dismissed from Western governments, the Soviets were consolidating their hold over what would become the Eastern Bloc. On 30–31 May, Ferenc Nagy—the democratically elected prime minister of Hungary—resigned from office under threats from the Hungarian Communist Party, which accused him of involvement in an alleged anti-state plot. His Independent Smallholders' Party had won a large majority in the 1945 Hungarian parliamentary election, but Communist salami tactics had progressively whittled its gains away, particularly in early 1947 when the Communists accused it key members of involvement in anti-state plots.

Hungary from the Nazis to the Soviets: The Establishment of the Communist Regime in Hungary, 1944-1948. Cambridge University Press (2006), p. 133 The Soviet Union, whose army was occupying Hungary at the time through the Allied Commission, played a key role this process by providing the supposed evidence of the Prime Minister's involvement, and also kidnapped Béla Kovács—the Smallholders' Party's popular General Secretary—to deport him to the Soviet Union in defiance of Parliament.Borhi, László. Hungary in the Cold War, 1945-1956. Central European University Press (2004), pp. 116-118 The History of the Soviet Bloc 1945–1991: A Chronology. Part 1: 1945–1952. 1947 By May, the Smallholders' Party had been deprived of its elected majority as a result of mass arrests and exclusions of its MPs, and Nagy was politically isolated. Receiving the Communists' ultimatum while travelling abroad in Switzerland, the Communists threatened to harm his son if he did not resign or return to Hungary to face trial. Nagy agreed to the former as a result, but he did not formally ratify his resignation until his hostage son had reached exile on 2 June.Borhi, László. Hungary in the Cold War, 1945-1956. Central European University Press (2004), p. 118 In addition, Nikola Petkov, the vocal leader of the Bulgarian opposition, was arrested soon after on 4 June to be tried for treason in August and executed in September. The timing of this was no doubt related to the Hungarian coup.Borhi, László. Hungary in the Cold War, 1945-1956. Central European University Press (2004), p. 118 Thus, the European geopolitical order of the next forty years was largely decided by May–June 1947. References *Ginsborg, Paul (2003).

His work centred on the text of the New Testament and New Testament manuscripts, but also included Hellenistic and biblical Greek and early Jewish literature (particularly Josephus), as well as the English Bible. Wikgren earned his Bachelor of Arts degree (in Greek) in 1928, his Master of Arts degree in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1932, all from the University of Chicago. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"A Comparative Study of the Theodotionic and Septuagint Versions of Daniel\\". An ordained minister in the mainline Northern Baptist Convention, Wikgren then served as a minister at First Baptist Church in Belleville, Kansas and as a professor of New Testament literature at Kansas City Baptist Theological Seminary (now Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Shawnee, Kansas) (1935-1937) and of biblical literature and classics at Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas (1937-1940) before returning to Chicago to join the University of Chicago Divinity School as the J. M. Powis Smith Instructor in 1940. At Chicago, Wikgren was a member of the Department of New Testament and Early Christian Literature in the university's Division of the Humanities, a department which he would later serve as chair. His colleagues in New Testament studies during his long tenure administering the department (1953-1972) included figures such as Norman Perrin, Robert M. Grant and Markus Barth. Perhaps Wikgren's most widely known contribution to the study of the New Testament was his role, together with Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, Carlo Maria Martini and Bruce M. Metzger, on the editorial committee that established the Greek text and critical apparatuses in the standard hand editions of the Greek New Testament: the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece (26th edition, published by the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft first in 1979 and revised in 1983) and the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament (3rd edition, published by the United Bible Societies in 1983). Wikgren served as president of the Chicago Society of Biblical Research in 1951–1952. He was a member of the Revised Standard Version committee from 1952, participating in the translation of the deuterocanonical books and the revision of the New Testament. And he was director of the Chicago Lectionary Project from 1958–1972.See the article on New Testament lectionaries He also held visiting professorships at a number of universities: Indiana University–Gary, Pacific School of Religion (Berkeley, California), University of Ghana, Århus University, Concordia Theological Seminary (Springfield, Illinois [now back in Fort Wayne, Indiana]) and Uppsala University.

Having received the \\"grant of speech\\" from Oyasama, Iburi dictated the Osashizu, additional divinely inspired instructions on the creation and maintenance of a Tenrikyo community. Iburi was born in Murō, Nara in 1833, but was forced to leave when his family became despondent. He moved to modern-day Tenri, and sought out a wife. His first wife died in childbirth, while the second arranged marriage to a gambling addict was quickly annulled. His third wife became gravely ill after childbirth which led him to seek Tenrikyo. He became a member after his wife was healed and went to see Oyasama every day, supporting her during times of religious persecution.『新版 飯降伊蔵伝』（植田英蔵著、善本社、1995年） Iburi presided over a period of rapid expansion for Tenrikyo, which saw it reach villages throughout Japan. In 1896, eight percent of all Japanese citizens were dues-paying adherents of Tenrikyo.Arakitōryō Henshūbu. \\"Oyasama go-nensai o moto ni kyōshi o furikaeru, dai-ichibu: Oyasama ichi-nensai kara Oyasama sanjū-nensai made.\\" Arakitōryō 209 (Fall 2002), p. 38. Iburi petitioned the government to be separated from the Sect Shinto group Shinto Honkyoku; this petition was granted in 1908. It was Iburi's intention to continue the Honseki position by passing on spiritual leadership to a worthy successor, while the Shinbashira position was passed on in the Nakayama family. He chose a woman, Naraito Ueda, for this position.

Biography =Early life= Bennett was born in Frankford, Philadelphia, on July 13, 1769. He earned a B.A. Degree at Philadelphia College before apprenticing with Dr. Benjamin Rush and attending medical school. In April 1791, he received the title Doctor of Medicine, at the same time he received his M. A. degree. Dr. Bennett married Elizabeth Hogg in 1793 and settled in Rockingham County, Virginia, establishing his practice in a log cabin. When Elizabeth became pregnant, Bennett engaged a Dr. Humphrey of Staunton, Virginia, to attend Elizabeth at the delivery. =Caesarean section= After Elizabeth had endured a prolonged labor, Dr. Humphrey and Bennett determined the only options were a Caesarean section on Elizabeth or a craniotomy on the unborn infant. Dr. Humphrey refused to do anything, feeling that either operation meant certain death for both the mother and her infant. It appears Dr. Humphrey then left the Bennett home. Desperate to save her child, Elizabeth begged her husband to perform the Caesarian section. Dr. Bennett assembled a crude operating table from two boards supported by barrels. Dr. Bennett gave his wife laudanum to make her sleepy and had two negro servants support her on the table while Elizabeth's sister, Mrs. Hawkins, held a tallow candle to light the makeshift operating table. Dr. Bennett cut his wife's abdomen with a single sweep of his knife and extracted his infant daughter, Maria. He then removed both of Elizabeth's ovaries, saying he'd \\"not be subjected to such an ordeal again.\\" Finally he sutured the surgical wound with stout linen thread, the kind used in frontier homes to sew heavy clothing. Elizabeth recovered and was able to be up a month later (see postpartum confinement). Dr. Bennett declared his wife healed as of March 1, 1794, writing a cryptic case history on the title page of one of his medical books. Elizabeth Bennett lived for thirty-six more years, passing away on April 20, 1830. Maria Bennett lived until 1870, married twice, and bore six children. Dr. Bennett refused to publicize the details of the surgery during his life. He said other doctors would never believe that a woman could survive this hazardous operation, done in the backwoods of Virginia, and he was \\"damned if he'd give them a chance to call him a liar.\\" Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio - coincidentally, only ten miles from Dr. Bennett's practice. Dr. A. L. Knight, a boyhood neighbor of the Bennetts, remembered hearing the details of Maria's birth when he was a youth. Dr. Knight collected eye-witness testimonies from Mrs. Hawkins and the surviving negro servant after Dr. Bennett's death and published the story in The Southern Historical Magazine in 1892 as part of \\"The Life and Times of Dr. Jesse Bennett, M.D.\\" =Later life= Dr. Bennett became active in civic affairs in the newly formed Mason County (now Mason County, West Virginia). He was appointed Major of the Mason County Militia in 1804 and represented Mason County in the Virginia Assembly. Aaron Burr reportedly tried to enlist Dr. Bennett's help with the Burr conspiracy for which Burr was charged with treason. Dr. Bennett refused to assist Aaron Burr and went on to serve the United States as an Army Surgeon in the War of 1812. Memorials Bennett's accomplishment is noted in two historical markers, one (calling him \\"Jessee Bennett\\") erected in 1983 by Virginia near the site of the operation in Edom and one erected by West Virginia, in 1973, near the site of his original burial. He was initially interred in the Bennett-Knopp Cemetery in Point Pleasant, West Virginia; his remains, along with those of his wife and a friend, were moved, with their original marker, to that town's Pioneer Cemetery in 1985.

(2009), Faces of War: The Untold Story of Edward Steichen's WWII Photographers, Berkeley Caliber, New York, New York, was a group of military photographers in the United States Navy during the Second World War, under the command of Edward Steichen. History The Navy had established this special group in early 1942, shortly after the US entry into the war, to document and publicize its aviation activities and allowed Steichen to recruit the most talented photographers he could find. Steichen and his unit initially reported to Capt Arthur W. Radford, and were made part of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics. Because Steichen wanted an unusual amount of control over the unit, outside the purview of the Navy's pre-existing photographic community, and because Radford agreed with him, it was decided the unit would operate out of the Bureau of Aeronautics' Training Literature Division, which was under Radford's direct command. This is why the unit's official name was \\"Training Literature Field Unit No. 1.\\" However, informally it was referred to as the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, and is generally referred to that way in the literature about it.Phillips, Christopher (1987), Steichen at War, Portland House, New York, New York, The main purpose Radford had for the unit was to promote the recruitment of pilots specifically for the Navy. Radford believed there was competition for a limited talent pool between the Navy and the Army Air Corps, and that attractive, top-rate photography in the press, posters, and leaflets would help the Navy reach its quota of 30,000 new pilots each year. Wayne Miller, one of the unit's photographers, remembered Steichen's instructions this way: \\" 'I don't care what you do, Wayne, but bring back something that will please the brass a little bit, an aircraft carrier or somebody with all the braid; spend the rest of your time photographing the man.' It was Steichen's prime concern—don't photograph the war; photograph the man, the little guy; the struggle, the heartaches, plus the dreams of this guy. Photograph the sailor.\\" Radford was given command of Carrier Division 11 in July, 1943. Rear Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. was made head of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and thus Steichen's commander. McCain was pleased by the results Steichen and his photographers were getting, and supported them fully, including seeing Steichen promoted to full Commander. McCain also had Steichen do portraits of senior Navy officers, in the Vanity Fair style for which Steichen was known, to smooth relations for the unit among differing commands. McCain's own portrait is shown below in the gallery. Steichen's responsibility increased to the point where, in early 1945, he was made director of a newly formed Naval Photographic Institute, and given formal control over all Navy combat photography. The unit was largely demobilized after the end of the war in August, 1945. As those servicemen with the most time overseas received priority in demobilization, almost all of the unit were home by Thanksgiving. Members The group of photographers Steichen originally chose for the unit were: *Lt Wayne Miller *Lt Dwight Long (who specialized in movies, not photography as such) *Lt Charles E. Kerlee *Lt Charles Fenno Jacobs *Lt Cmdr Horace Bristol *En Victor Jorgensen *En Alfonso (\\"Fons\\") Iannelli Steichen wanted Ansel Adams to be part of the unit, to build and direct a state-of-the- art darkroom and laboratory in Washington, D.C.Alinder, Mary Street (1996), Ansel Adams: A Biography, Henry Holt and Co., New York, New York, In approximately February, 1942, Steichen asked Adams to join. Adams agreed, with two conditions: He wanted to be commissioned as an officer, and he also told Steichen he would not be available until July 1. Steichen, who wanted the team assembled as quickly as possible, passed Adams by, and had his other photographers ready to go by early April. Among the photographers whom Steichen later added in early 1945 was Morley Baer who remained with the unit until the end of the war. Works The photographs the unit produced were used as the basis for at least two contemporary books: *Power In the Pacific – compiled by Steichen to accompany an exhibition by the same title at the Museum of Modern ArtSteichen, Edward (1945) (compiled by), Power In the Pacific, US Camera Publishing Corp, New York, New York *The Blue Ghost – a record of Steichen's November 1943 tour on board the USS Lexington (CV-16).Steichen, Edward (1947), The Blue Ghost, Harcourt, Brace, and Co., New York, New York Gallery File:Gerald Ford playing basketball on USS Monterey 06-1944-Darkened Larger.jpgGerald Ford is the jumper on the left of this 1944 photograph on board USS Monterey by Victor Jorgensen Image:RAdm John S McCain, Sr, by Steichen.jpgA portrait of RAdm John S.

After beginning his career as a musician in the classical repertoire, he specialized in folk music and traditional songs. He released about 50 78 rpm records during his career, mostly for La Bonne Chanson. He also recorded a few songs under the pseudonym Jacques Dupont, including Partons, la mer est belle, Le Soir sur l'eau, and Le Lac des amours, and recorded the song Le Rêve passe with the Canadian Grenadier Guards Band for RCA. Many of his recordings include his own compositions. During his lifetime he wrote more than 200 songs, many of them comic patter songs, as well as hymns and two requiem masses. Early life and education Born in Montreal, Viau studied the piano in his youth with Arthur Caron. At the age of 17 he began studying singing seriously. He received his early training privately and only later in life pursued university studies. In 1966 he earned a Bachelor of Music from the Université de Montréal and that same year was awarded a teaching certificate from the Quebec Ministry of Education. His teachers included Victor Brault, Arthur Laurendeau (voice), Conrad Letendre (diction), Georges Mercure (Gregorian chant), Oscar O'Brien, Michel Perrault, and Roland Van de Goor (harmony). Career Viau made his professional opera debut as Mercutio in Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at Loew's Theatre in Montreal in 1931. From 1932 to 1934 he sang in Paul-Émile Corbeil's Imperial Grenadiers. For the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission he performed in two series in 1934: La Petite Histoire and Le Chanteur de lied. For the latter series he collaborated with pianists Léo-Pol Morin and Jean-Marie Beaudet. He soon after began singing on CBC Radio programs. He notably performed for 21 years on Le Réveil rural and 15 years on Le Quart d'heure de La Bonne Chanson. The majority of his recordings were made from the late 1930s through the 1950s. Viau began composing his own works in the late 1930s. In 1954 he published Six Chansonnettes pour bambins et bambines and in 1958 Six Chansons enfantines with Éditions Albert Viau. From 1953-1954 he worked for CJMS as a radio producer. He served as the choirmaster at St-Sixte Church in Ville St-Laurent, Montreal from 1950–1983; also operating a private studio during those years where he taught voice, piano, guitar, and recorder lessons. From 1965-1985 he taught music for the Catholic School Commission of Montreal. He continued to give recitals in Canada and the United States and work with vocal groups as a director and arranger until his retirement in 1986. In 2001 Viau died in Montreal at the age of 90.

In probability theory a Brownian excursion process is a stochastic process that is closely related to a Wiener process (or Brownian motion). Realisations of Brownian excursion processes are essentially just realizations of a Wiener process selected to satisfy certain conditions. In particular, a Brownian excursion process is a Wiener process conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1\\\\. Alternatively, it is a Brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive. BEPs are important because, among other reasons, they naturally arise as the limit process of a number of conditional functional central limit theorems.Durrett, Iglehart: Functionals of Brownian Meander and Brownian Excursion, (1975) Definition A Brownian excursion process, e, is a Wiener process (or Brownian motion) conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1\\\\. Alternatively, it is a Brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive. Another representation of a Brownian excursion e in terms of a Brownian motion process W (due to Paul Lévy and noted by Kiyosi Itô and Henry P. McKean, Jr.Itô and McKean (1974, page 75)) is in terms of the last time \\\\tau_{-} that W hits zero before time 1 and the first time \\\\tau_{+} that Brownian motion W hits zero after time 1: : \\\\\\\\{ e(t) : \\\\ {0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} \\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{d}{=} \\\\ \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{W((1-t) \\\\tau_{-} + t \\\\tau_{+} )}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau_+ - \\\\tau_{-}}} : \\\\ 0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} . Let \\\\tau_m be the time that a Brownian bridge process W_0 achieves its minimum on [0, 1]. Vervaat (1979) shows that : \\\\\\\\{ e(t) : \\\\ {0\\\\le t \\\\le 1} \\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{d}{=} \\\\ \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ W_0 ( \\\\tau_m + t \\\\bmod 1) - W_0 (\\\\tau_m ): \\\\ 0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} . Properties Vervaat's representation of a Brownian excursion has several consequences for various functions of e. In particular: :M_{+} \\\\equiv \\\\sup_{0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} e(t) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{d}{=} \\\\ \\\\sup_{0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} W_0 (t) - \\\\inf_{0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} W_0 (t) , (this can also be derived by explicit calculationsChung (1976)Kennedy (1976)) and : \\\\int_0^1 e(t) \\\\, dt \\\\ \\\\stackrel{d}{=} \\\\ \\\\int_0^1 W_0 (t) \\\\, dt - \\\\inf_{0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} W_0 (t) . The following result holds:Durrett and Iglehart (1977) :E M_+ = \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi/2} \\\\approx 1.25331 \\\\ldots, \\\\, and the following values for the second moment and variance can be calculated by the exact form of the distribution and density: :E M_+^2 \\\\approx 1.64493 \\\\ldots \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\operatorname{Var}(M_+) \\\\approx 0.0741337 \\\\ldots. Groeneboom (1989), Lemma 4.2 gives an expression for the Laplace transform of (the density) of \\\\int_0^1 e(t) \\\\, dt . A formula for a certain double transform of the distribution of this area integral is given by Louchard (1984). Groeneboom (1983) and Pitman (1983) give decompositions of Brownian motion W in terms of i.i.d Brownian excursions and the least concave majorant (or greatest convex minorant) of W. For an introduction to Itô's general theory of Brownian excursions and the Itô Poisson process of excursions, see Revuz and Yor (1994), chapter XII.  Connections and applications  The Brownian excursion area :A_+ \\\\equiv \\\\int_0^1 e(t) \\\\, dt arises in connection with the enumeration of connected graphs, many other problems in combinatorial theory; see e.g. and the limit distribution of the Betti numbers of certain varieties in cohomology theory. Takacs (1991a) shows that A_+ has density :f_{A_+} (x) = \\\\frac{2 \\\\sqrt{6}}{x^2} \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty v_j^{2/3} e^{-v_j} U\\\\left ( - \\\\frac{5}{6} , \\\\frac{4}{3}; v_j \\\\right ) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ with } \\\\ \\\\ v_j = \\\\frac{2 a_j^3}{27x^2} where a_j are the zeros of the Airy function and U is the confluent hypergeometric function. Janson and Louchard (2007) show that :f_{A_+} (x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{72 \\\\sqrt{6}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} x^2 e^{- 6 x^2} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ as } \\\\ \\\\ x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, and :P(A_+ > x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{6 \\\\sqrt{6}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} x e^{- 6x^2} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ as } \\\\ \\\\ x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. They also give higher- order expansions in both cases. Janson (2007) gives moments of A_+ and many other area functionals. In particular, : E (A_+) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}, \\\\ \\\\ E(A_+^2) = \\\\frac{5}{12} \\\\approx 0.416666 \\\\ldots, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\operatorname{Var}(A_+) = \\\\frac{5}{12} - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8} \\\\approx .0239675 \\\\ldots \\\\ . Brownian excursions also arise in connection with queuing problems, railway traffic, and the heights of random rooted binary trees.

Antonio Chaboya married his first wife Maria Juliana Feliciana Rosario Buitron in 1826. After her death, he married Maria Ramona Encarnacion Higuera in 1846. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Fuchs and Almen worked at the Research Laboratory of General Motors Corporation before the start of MIC. The Almen strip or Almen system, a tool for duplicating the shot peening process, was named after John Almen. Fuchs started in his garage accompanied by his son-in-law, Fred Landecker, with the idea of working in railways car suspensions and assemblies. Nevertheless, the shot peening industry was beginning and the automotive sector was not showing much interest. So it was the aircraft industry which first began to use the beneficial processes. The company worked, for example, in the early 1950s with the famous Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In the mid-1950s, the company worked on the wing skins of Lockheed Super Constellation aircraft. In 1968 the company was acquiredCurtiss-Wright History http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company- histories/CurtissWright-Corporation-Company-History.html by Curtiss-Wright which had begun an expansion program at its Buffalo extrusion facility, adding new forging and machining equipment for building aircraft and aerospace components. In the 1970s, the idea of metal peening with light was explored in the company and in the metal treatment industry. Lawrence Livermore Laboratories at the end of the 1990s, working under a government contract for a laser to illuminate passing satellites, developed a process of peening with light with enough power to use it also for commercial purposes. Metal Improvement Company, under a CRADA agreement with Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, began to develop Hackel, Lloyd; Laser Peening Technology Has Come of Age http://www.shotpeener.com/library/pdf/2005028.pdf this technology for commercial customers and in 2003 the company introduced the laser peening to the market.

It forms the southern exclave of the county-level city of Golmud, in Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, partially administrated by Amdo County, Tibet Autonomous Region since 1963 and still officially a territory of Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai under trust administration of Golmud, Haixi Prefecture, Qinghai. Before the local administrative reform of 2005, it was known as Tanggula Township (). It is the only place in China simultaneously under jurisdiction of three prefectures. Geography Tanggula Mountains, Tanggula Town DMA, 1990) Tanggula Town is an administrative unit that occupies in the southwestern corner of Qinghai province. It borders on the Tibet Autonomous Region in the south and west, and on Qinghai's Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the east and north. The western \\"panhandle\\" of Yushu Prefecture separates Tanggula Town from the rest of Haixi Prefecture, making it an exclave of Golmud City and of the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Tanggula Town is around away (straight-line distance) both from the central city of Golmud and from the town of Gyêgu, the seat of Yushu Prefecture, but it has practical road (and rail) connection only with the former. The Tanggula settlement, also known as Marquwo, Tuotuoheyan, or Togtogquwo, is located at above sea level in the central part of Tanggula Mountains, as the town's name indicates. The most famous local feature is the Geladaindong Peak (at elevation), near which the source of the Yangtze River is considered to be located. The area around the peak is protected as part of the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The main settlement is located near the highway and railway crossing of the Tuotuo River, which is one of the headwaters of the Yangtze. This settlement is served by the Togtogquwo railway station.Tuotuo River Town Other settlements in the same highway/railway corridor, further south, are Tongtian Heyan (\\"Tongtian Riverside\\"), Yanshiping, Wenquan, and Tanggula Bingzhan (\\"Tanggula Military Post\\").E.g., 实用中国地图集 (Shiyong Zhongguo Dituji, \\"Practical Atlas of China\\"), 2008, ; map of Qinghai on pp. 172-173 Tanggula Town is administratively divided into 8 village-level units (seven nomads' committee and one villagers' committee). The region is sparsely populated, with the registered population of 1,286 (year 2006) and the present population estimated at about 1,900. Most of these people live in several small villages located along the Golmud-Lhasa highway and railway corridor (China National Highway 109 and Qinghai-Tibet Railway).

Climate  Tanggulashan has a tundra climate (ET) with long, frigid, very dry winters and short, cool, less dry summers. Economy The traditional occupation of the local residents is livestock (sheep) breeding. According to the local authorities in Golmud, overgrazing is a concern in the area, as it is throughout the southwestern Qinghai.M. Zhao, O. Schell. \\"Tibet: Plateau in Peril\\".

Golmud City Government web site, 2010-03-29 Besides overgrazing by livestock, the local pasture land also suffers depredation by rats. After some attempts to poison them (with obvious side effects), in 2009 the local authorities started a campaign to attract birds of prey to the area, hoping that they would help to keep the rat population under control. For this purpose, 830 bird perches were erected in the affected areas.Govt calling hawks and wolves to eat up rats.

It may also refer to a society or group of people that entirely rejects a set hierarchy. Anarchy was first used in 1539, meaning \\"an absence of government\\". Pierre-Joseph Proudhon adopted anarchy and anarchist in his 1840 treatise What Is Property? to refer to anarchism, a new political philosophy and social movement which advocates stateless societies based on free and voluntary associations. Anarchists seek a system based on the abolishment of all unjustified, coercitive hierarchy and the creation of system of direct democracy and worker cooperatives.Tamblyn, Nathan (30 April 2019). \\"The Common Ground of Law and Anarchism\\". Liverpool Law Review. 40 (1): 65–78. .Kinna, Ruth (24 April 2019). \\"Anarchism\\". Oxford Bibliographies. Oxford University Press. . In practical terms, anarchy can refer to the curtailment or abolition of traditional forms of government and institutions. It can also designate a nation or any inhabited place that has no system of government or central rule. Anarchy is primarily advocated by individual anarchists who propose replacing government with voluntary institutions. These true institutions or associations generally are modeled on nature since they can represent concepts such as community and economic self-reliance, interdependence, or individualism. Although anarchy is often negatively used as a synonym of chaos or societal collapse, this is not the meaning that anarchists attribute to anarchy, a society without hierarchies. Proudhon wrote that anarchy is \\"Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\\".  Etymology  Anarchy comes from the Medieval Latin anarchia and from the Greek anarchos (\\"having no ruler\\"), with an-+ archos (\\"ruler\\") literally meaning \\"without ruler\\". The circle-A anarchist symbol is a monogram that consists of the capital letter A surrounded by the capital letter O. The letter A is derived from the first letter of anarchy or anarchism in most European languages and is the same in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts. The O stands for order and together they stand for \\"society seeks order in anarchy\\" (), a phrase written by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 book What Is Property?  Overview  = Anthropology = Circle-A anarchist symbol Although most known societies are characterized by the presence of hierarchy or the state, anthropologists have studied many egalitarian stateless societies, including most nomadic hunter-gatherer societies and horticultural societies such as the Semai and the Piaroa. Many of these societies can be considered to be anarchic in the sense that they explicitly reject the idea of centralized political authority. The egalitarianism typical of human hunter-gatherers is interesting when viewed in an evolutionary context. One of humanity's two closest primate relatives, the chimpanzee, is anything but egalitarian, forming hierarchies that are dominated by alpha males. So great is the contrast with human hunter- gatherers that it is widely argued by palaeoanthropologists that resistance to being dominated was a key factor driving the development of human consciousness, language, kinship and social organization.Erdal, D. and A. Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), Modelling the early human mind. Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs.Christopher Boehm (2001), Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. In Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology, anarchist anthropologist David Graeber attempted to outline areas of research that intellectuals might explore in creating a cohesive body of anarchist social theory. Graeber posited that anthropology is \\"particularly well positioned\\" as an academic discipline that can look at the gamut of human societies and organizations to study, analyze and catalog alternative social and economic structures around the world, and most importantly, present these alternatives to the world. In Society Against the State, Pierre Clastres examined stateless societies where certain cultural practices and attitudes avert the development of hierarchy and the state. Clastres dismissed the notion that the state is the natural outcome of the evolution of human societies. In The Art of Not Being Governed, James C. Scott studied Zomia, a vast stateless upland region on Southeast Asia. The hills of Zomia isolate it from the lowland states and create a refuge for people to escape to. Scott argues that the particular social and cultural characteristics of the hill people were adapted to escape capture by the lowland states and should not be viewed as relics of barbarism abandoned by civilization. Peter Leeson examined a variety of institutions of private law enforcement developed in anarchic situations by eighteenth century pirates, preliterate tribesmen, and Californian prison gangs. These groups all adapted different methods of private law enforcement to meet their specific needs and the particulars of their anarchic situation. Anarcho-primitivists base their critique of civilization partly on anthropological studies of nomadic hunter-gatherers, noting that the shift towards domestication has likely caused increases in disease, labor, inequality, warfare and psychological disorders. Authors such as John Zerzan have argued that negative stereotypes of primitive societies (e.g. that they are typically extremely violent or impoverished) are used to justify the values of modern industrial society and to move individuals further away from more natural and equitable conditions.Industrial Society and Its Future, Theodore Kaczynski = International relations = In international relations, anarchy is \\"the absence of any authority superior to nation-states and capable of arbitrating their disputes and enforcing international law\\".Lechner, Silviya (November 2017). \\"Anarchy in International Relations\\".

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\\"Benjamin Tucker. Individual Liberty. Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority, as follows: \\"They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism ... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\\"Anarchist historian George Woodcock report of Mikhail Bakunin's anti-authoritarianism and shows opposition to both state and non-state forms of authority as follows: \\"All anarchists deny authority; many of them fight against it.\\" (p. 9) ... Bakunin did not convert the League's central committee to his full program, but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the Berne Congress of September 1868, demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both Church and State.\\" There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have been divided into the categories of individualist and social anarchism, or similar dual classifications.Ostergaard, Geoffrey. \\"Anarchism\\".

The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both.... Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective.

I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand – that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation.

In European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements, Carl Landauer summarized the difference between communist and individualist anarchists by stating that \\"the communist anarchists also do not acknowledge any right to society to force the individual. They differ from the anarchistic individualists in their belief that men, if freed from coercion, will enter into voluntary associations of a communistic type, while the other wing believes that the free person will prefer a high degree of isolation\\".Landauer, Carl (1960). European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements. University of California Press. p. 127. As a social movement, anarchism has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a mass social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenonSkirda, Alexandre. Facing the Enemy: A History of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968.

Nonetheless, individualist anarchism did influence the bigger currentsCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho- communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation. Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938. and individualists also participated in large anarchist organizations.Within the synthesist anarchist organization, the Fédération Anarchiste, there existed an individualist anarchist tendency alongside anarcho-communist and anarchosyndicalist currents. Individualist anarchists participating inside the Fédération Anarchiste included Charles-Auguste Bontemps, Georges Vincey and André Arru. \\"Pensée et action des anarchistes en France : 1950–1970\\" by Cédric GUÉRINIn Italy in 1945, during the Founding Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation, there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria who was an important anarchist of the time.Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897 – October 1961) by Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey Some anarchists are pacifists who support self-defense or non-violence (anarcho-pacifism)George Woodcock.

[...] They are not concerned with the social consequences of capitalism for the weak, powerless and ignorant. [...] As such, anarcho- capitalism overlooks the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist anarchists like Spooner and Tucker. In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice. Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the state, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.\\"Goodway, David (2006).

For Kant, anarchy falls short of being a true civil state because the law is only an \\"empty recommendation\\" if force is not included to make this law efficacious (\\"legitimation\\", etymologically fancifully from legem timere, i.e. \\"fearing the law\\"). Compare For there to be such a state, force must be included while law and freedom are maintained, a state which Kant calls a republic.Kant, Immanuel (1798). \\"Grundzüge der Schilderung des Charakters der Menschengattung\\". In Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. AA: VII, s.330.Louden, Robert B., ed. (2006). Kant: Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Cambridge University Press. p. 235.

Woodhouse, foreword by A.D. Lindsay > (University of Chicago Press, 1951).] As people began to theorize about the English Civil War, anarchy came to be more sharply defined, albeit from differing political perspectives: * 1651 – Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan) describes the natural condition of mankind as a war of all against all, where man lives a brutish existence: \\"For the savage people in many places of America, except the government of small families, the concord whereof dependeth on natural lust, have no government at all, and live at this day in that brutish manner\\". Hobbes finds three basic causes of the conflict in this state of nature, namely competition, diffidence and glory: \\"The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation\\". His first law of nature is that \\"every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war\\". In the state of nature, \\"every man has a right to every thing, even to then go for one another's body\\", but the second law is that in order to secure the advantages of peace \\"that a man be willing, when others are so too [...] to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself\\". This is the beginning of contracts/covenants; performing of which is the third law of nature. Therefore, injustice is failure to perform in a covenant and all else is just. * 1656 – James Harrington (The Commonwealth of Oceana) uses the term to describe a situation where the people use force to impose a government on an economic base composed of either solitary land ownership (absolute monarchy), or land in the ownership of a few (mixed monarchy). He distinguishes it from commonwealth, the situation when both land ownership and governance shared by the population at large, seeing it as a temporary situation arising from an imbalance between the form of government and the form of property relations. = French Revolution (1789–1799) = Heads of aristocrats on spikes Thomas Carlyle, Scottish essayist of the Victorian era known foremost for his widely influential work of history, The French Revolution, wrote that the French Revolution was a war against both aristocracy and anarchy: In 1789, Armand, duc d'Aiguillon came before the National Assembly and shared his views on the anarchy: Armand was later exiled because he was viewed as being opposed to the revolution's violent tactics. Professor Chris Bossche commented on the role of anarchy in the revolution: = Jamaica (1720) = In 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor of Jamaica, wrote to John Robinson, the Bishop of London: > As to the Englishmen that came as mechanics hither, very young and have now > acquired good estates in Sugar Plantations and Indigo & co., of course they > know no better than what maxims they learn in the Country. To be now short & > plain Your Lordship will see that they have no maxims of Church and State > but what are absolutely anarchical. In the letter, Lawes goes on to complain that these \\"estated men now are like Jonah's gourd\\" and details the humble origins of the \\"creolians\\" largely lacking an education and flouting the rules of church and state. In particular, he cites their refusal to abide by the Deficiency Act which required slave owners to procure from England one white person for every 40 enslaved Africans, thereby hoping to expand their own estates and inhibit further English/Irish immigration. Lawes describes the government as being \\"anarchical, but nearest to any form of Aristocracy\\", further arguing: \\"Must the King's good subjects at home who are as capable to begin plantations, as their Fathers, and themselves were, be excluded from their Liberty of settling Plantations in this noble Island, for ever and the King and Nation at home be deprived of so much riches, to make a few upstart Gentlemen Princes?\\"Jamaica: Description of the Principal Persons there (about 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor) in Caribbeana Vol. III (1911), edited by Vere Langford Oliver = Russian Civil War (1917–1922) = Nestor Makhno, the leader of the anarchist Free Territory in Ukraine during the Russian Civil War in 1918 During the Russian Civil War which initially started as a confrontation between the Bolsheviks and monarchists, on the territory of today's Ukraine a new force emerged, namely the Anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno. The Ukrainian Anarchist during the Russian Civil War (also called the Black Army) organized the Free Territory, an anarchist society committed to resisting state authority, whether capitalist or communist.Yekelchyk 2007, p 80. This project was cut short by the consolidation of Bolshevik power. Makhno was described by anarchist theorist Emma Goldman as \\"an extraordinary figure\\" leading a revolutionary peasants' movement. During 1918, most of Ukraine was controlled by the forces of the Central Powers which were unpopular among the people. In March 1918, the young anarchist Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of Symon Petlura) forces and units of the White Army, capturing a lot of German and Austro-Hungarian arms. These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician and became known as Batko (\\"Father\\") to his admirers. Makhno called the Bolsheviks dictators and opposed the \\"Cheka [secret police] [...] and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions\\" and called for \\"[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like\\".Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist). Peter Arshinov, History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918–1921), 1923. Black & Red, 1974 The Bolsheviks accused the Makhnovists of imposing a formal government over the area they controlled and also said that Makhnovists used forced conscription, committed summary executions and had two military and counter-intelligence forces, namely the Razvedka and the Kommissiya Protivmakhnovskikh Del (patterned after the Cheka and the GRU).Footman, David. Civil War In Russia Frederick A.Praeger 1961, p287 However, later historians have dismissed these claims as fraudulent propaganda.Guerin, Daniel. Anarchism: Theory and Practice = China (1916–1928) = Chinese warlord coalitions as of 1925 In 1916, the country dissolved into a state of anarchy, when China was controlled by many local warlords. = Spain (1936) = Francisco Franco, a fascist Spanish general staged a military rebellion which attempted to overthrow the Popular Front (the established Spanish government), in 1936. Following Franco's rebellion, anarchist, communist and what remained of Popular Front joined forces against Franco. This was seen as a social revolution as much as a political revolution to some. Throughout the war and shortly after, many Spanish working-class citizens lived in anarchist communities, many of which thrived during this time. With major support of Germany and Italy, the Nationalists won the war and set up a fascist dictatorship led by Franco, effectively ending much of the anarchism in Spain. = Albania (1997) = In 1997, Albania fell into a state of anarchy, mainly due to the heavy losses of money caused by the collapse of pyramid firms. As a result of the societal collapse, heavily armed criminals roamed freely with near total impunity. There were often 3–4 gangs per city, especially in the south, where the police did not have sufficient resources to deal with gang-related crime. = Somalia (1991–2006) = Map of Somalia showing the major self-declared states and areas of factional control in 2006 Following the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia and the ensuing collapse of the central government, residents reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, traditional or Islamic law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences. The legal structure in the country was divided along three lines, namely civil law, religious law and customary law (xeer). While Somalia's formal judicial system was largely destroyed after the fall of the Siad Barre regime, it was later gradually rebuilt and administered under different regional governments such as the autonomous Puntland and Somaliland macro-regions. In the case of the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government, new interim judicial structures were formed through various international conferences. Despite some significant political differences between them, all of these administrations shared similar legal structures, much of which were predicated on the judicial systems of previous Somali administrations. These similarities in civil law included a charter which affirms the primacy of Muslim shari'a or religious law, although in practice shari'a is applied mainly to matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and civil issues. The charter assured the independence of the judiciary which in turn was protected by a judicial committee; a three-tier judicial system including a supreme court, a court of appeals and courts of first instance (either divided between district and regional courts, or a single court per region); and the laws of the civilian government which were in effect prior to the military coup d'état that saw the Barre regime into power remain in forced until the laws are amended.

The objectives of the organisation were to support Jews in need of financial help. It promoted emigration of Jews to Israel and supported poor soldiers in the Israeli military. In 2003, it was listed as the second-largest charitable foundation in Israel by Ha'aretz. In 2010 Newsweek magazine listed him in the Top 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America. He was awarded Hadassah's first Man of Distinction in 2010, and the Raoul Wallenberg Award in 2014. He was listed in the \\"Jerusalem Post's Top 50 Most Influential Jews\\" of 2014 and 2015. Early life and education Born in Winthrop, Massachusetts, Eckstein was the son of the Rabbi and psychologist Dr. Simon \\"Sy\\" Eckstein (1919–2016) and his wife Belle Eckstein (née Hirschman) of Tampa, Florida. In 1952, when he was just a year old, Eckstein moved with his family to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, as his father accepted a newly created rabbinic post as the Chief Rabbi of Ottawa, where he was raised, as his father oversaw four synagogues, two which eventually merged to form Congregation Beth Shalom. He was a graduate of Yeshiva University High School for Boys. Eckstein served as a faculty member at Columbia University, the Chicago Theological Seminary and the Northern Baptist Seminary. The Fellowship After serving as national co-director of inter-religious affairs for the Anti-Defamation League, Eckstein founded the Holyland Fellowship of Christians and Jews in 1983 to help Christians and Jews work together on projects promoting the safety and security of Jews in Israel and around the world. The organization was renamed the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews in 1991. Its first goal is to provide material aid to needy Jewish families and the elderly, for example, by helping them buy food and medicine. A secondary mission is promoting Jewish emigration to Israel. The third is supporting the Israeli military by aiding poor Israeli soldiers. When Eckstein started the Fellowship, he had no salary, no medical benefits and a pregnant wife. He worked part-time as a rabbi. In the early years, he received the majority of his donations from fellow Jews. Often these gifts were grudgingly given. \\"I don't know what you're doing, and I don't know if I like what you're doing,\\" one Jewish philanthropist from Chicago said to him, but he nonetheless donated. But from the mid-1990s, he became popular with Evangelical Christians, leading to growth of the charity each year. In December 2003, the I.F.C.J. was listed as the second-largest charitable foundation in the country by Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. Eckstein was also known for private donations to the Israeli military, through the US-American lobby group \\"Friends of the IDF\\". Personal life and death Eckstein held dual citizenship in the U.S. and Israel, having become an Israeli citizen in 2002. He had three daughters with his first wife, Bonnie Siegman; the couple subsequently divorced. His daughter Yael Eckstein is the president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.

Daniela is a beautiful girl, a rebel and a fighter, raised in one of the poorest neighborhoods; and Santiago, the son of millionaires, a young man who does not have any clear aims in his life. But not everything will be fine, as Santiago's family opposed the relationship, not only by social differences, but by a tragic past that surrounds them. The tragic past is the brutal murder of Daniela's mother, twenty years ago. It was Horatio, Santiago's father who committed the crime, but the blame is on Diego, Daniela's father. The latter is sent to jail for twenty years. Daniela is a girl who perseveres a lot. She works as a secretary, but the chief of the company wants her and even tries to rape her.

In positive psychology, zest (or ecstasy) is one of the 24 strengths possessed by humanity. As a component of the virtue of courage, zest is defined as living life with a sense of excitement, anticipation, and energy. Approaching life as an adventure; such that one has \\"motivation in challenging situations or tasks\\". Zest is essentially a concept of courage, and involves acquiring the motivation to complete challenging situations and tasks. Those who have zest exude enthusiasm, excitement and energy while approaching tasks in life. Hence, the concept of zest involves performing tasks wholeheartedly, whilst also being adventurous, vivacious and energetic.Snyder, C. R., & Lopez, S. J. (2007). The Value of Wisdom and Courage. Positive psychology: the scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (p. 241). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE Publications. It discourages the focus on the negative views of psychology. It embraces a notion that one must observe people that \\"live well\\" in order to truly understand positive psychology. (For example, a Buddhist monk would be a preferred subject of observation compared to a college student.) Zestful people simply enjoy things more than people low in zestfulness. Zest is a positive trait reflecting a person's approach to life with anticipation, energy, enthusiasm and excitement. Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman developed terminology to describe human strengths. They developed a descriptive list of six human virtues (Wisdom and Knowledge, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, and Transcendence) comprising 24 strengths. Zest is one of the four strengths that combine to make up the virtue of courage, as defined by this system. Measurement The VIA-IS is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the strength with which respondents answer strength-relevant statements about themselves on a 1-5 Likert scale. The following statements on the VIA-IS are used to measure a persons zest: I look forward to each new day; I cannot wait to get started on a project; I want to fully participate in life, not just view it from the sidelines. Criticism As with many other constructs in the relatively new field of Positive Psychology, it is difficult to quantify zest. Other traits like socioeconomic status, which can easily be measured by gross income per household, or constructs like fear, which can be quantified by changes in heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation, have much more defined and widely accepted methods of measure. However, measurements of Zest are still in the beginning stages of development. How do we measure how energetic one person is compared to another? How do we determine exactly how excited a person is about life? What precisely does it mean to approach life adventurously? These are just a few of the questions that must be answered to most effectively research zest. Relating to the problem of operationalizing zest, much of the research currently done on this and many of the 24 character strengths are done via self-report. A Self report study is one in which participants are simply asked to report their own feelings or thoughts. There are many problems in research associated with self-report. The most pertinent one being the validity and reliability of measures as they are completely subjective rather than objective. People can misrepresent themselves or misinterpret the questions posed to them. Since such data is not the most scientifically convincing body of evidence upon which to rest scientific conclusions, Positive Psychological research is very focused on developing more objective measures for topics such as zest in order to help build a stronger science of organizational behavior. Work NASA astronaut Pete Conrad taking a shower aboard the Skylab space station. Zest can be promoted in the workplace so that workers can have a more positive approach in their life which indirectly can affect their anticipation, excitement, and energy in the workplace. Evidence from a present study that had 9803 employed adults respond to a survey on an internet site, measured zest, orientation to work as a calling, and satisfaction to work and life in general. The survey showed that for many of the employees, work was a calling and a satisfaction. Employers can use such information to increase the productivity of their employees by taking zest into consideration. The study found that professionals had the highest zest, while clerical workers and homemakers were the least zestful. Professionals and homemakers viewed their job as a calling, while clerical workers were the least likely to do so. Clerical workers displayed one of the lowest levels of zest because in most instances they viewed their work as a career, a pedestal in the hopes of acquiring status and power to find a more suitable job for themselves in the future. The results of this study follow trends observed by many other studies as well. Zest is speculated to be contagious just like many other strengths of character. Zest is obviously connected to, if not equal to group morale and can be a point of discussion for new studies from a positive organizational perspective with emphasis on zest. Psychologists have learned about two main ways of promoting zest within workers: physical fitness and health set the tone for zest and it can be sustained through hope and optimism. Depression is a well-documented enemy of zest, and its toll on productivity and physical health is enormous. The prevention or reduction of depression among workers might pay the additional benefit of increasing their sense that work is a calling. Zest is also linked to psychological well-being which is crucial in a work organization. For instance, psychological well-being predicts improved job performance, reduced absenteeism and reduced employee turnover. These are all benefits that can be explored more critically to make changes in the workplace. Increasing zestfulness is highly likely to increase the ability to be habitually happy.Wilner, J. (2012). Zest, Savoring and Happiness. Psych Central. Retrieved on March 21, 2013, from http://blogs.psychcentral.com/positive-psychology/2012/04/zest-savoring-and- happiness/ The results of a 2009 study on 228 schoolteacher in Hong Kong indicated that zest was often associated with positive emotions as well as increased levels of life satisfaction in teachers. It is suggested that cultivating zest in school teachers could help combat teacher burnout. Overall, zest is said to be one character strength that coincides with healthy working behaviors such as ambition, creativity, persistence and leadership, demonstrating that strengths-based interventions that cultivate zest can help improve work environments (see application for more information).It is also suggested that zest should be cultivated in the workplace in order to increase work satisfaction as well as general life satisfaction. The cultivation of zest may also decrease workplace burnout, which is the loss of productivity and enthusiasm for working. Positive youth development Zest, along with gratitude, hope, curiosity and love, are important aspects of positive psychology and key to positive character development. The adequate promotion of these characteristics not only in domestic life but also in schools and other educational environments is extremely important to positive youth development. Furthermore, through promotion of character strengths such as zest children tend to experience fewer psychological problems such as depression and anxiety disorders. In fact, research shows that zest, along with hope and leadership, is associated with fewer issues with anxiety and depression. This suggests that the cultivation of zest can serve as a buffer against mental illness. Youths with high levels of zest also tend to excel academically and lead happier, brighter lives. More emphasis needs to be placed on positive developing characteristics such as zest, gratitude, hope, curiosity and love in schooling environments and live in general so that youth successfully and positively develop.  Life satisfaction and Zest  Zest has been found to be linked to higher levels of life satisfaction among adults as well as youths. Studies suggest that certain character strengths, including zest as well as curiosity, gratitude, hope, and humor are highly correlated with life satisfaction, whereas others strengths demonstrate low correlations with life satisfaction (appreciation of beauty and excellence, creativity, kindness, love of learning and perspective) It is suggested that zest is associated with higher life satisfaction because it is associated with living in the \\"here and now,\\" which is also associated with life satisfaction. Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine zestful people who are often unhappy.  Demographics  Certain character strengths, including zest, have been found to be more common among youths than adults. This possibly reflects the influence of social and cognitive maturation and certain needs during different developmental periods In yet another study that reaffirmed the idea that zest was one of the VIA character strengths that had a strong link to life satisfaction, another trend in zest was discovered. This study indicated slight gender differences in levels of zest. For women, life satisfaction was predicted by zest, gratitude, hope, appreciation of beauty and love, whereas men's life satisfaction was predicted by creativity, perspective, fairness and humor. These findings go along with gender stereotypes and suggest that life satisfaction comes when one lives according to the strengths especially valued in one's culture.  Zest and mental state  There is evidence on the VIA- Youth subscalehttps://www.viacharacter.org/www/Portals/0/VIA%20Supplement-%20Using%20Youth%20Survey%20with%20Children%20with%20Intellectual%20Disabilities.pdf that zest is correlated with higher levels of neuroticism as well. Levels of zest have been found to be linked with post-traumatic growth, meaning that levels of zest increased with each traumatic event. This suggest that people may be more resilient than existing theories state, given the correlation between traumatic events and increases in character strengths such as zest  Application  There are a few working ways to help individuals cultivate zest: One method to cultivate zest is acting \\"as if,' which involves living a \\"faith-based\\" rather than an \\"evidenced-based\\" life. This means believing in things that there may not be much evidence for or proof of. Additionally, adopting strong body language may help, as well as \\"faking it until you make it\\" meaning acting as though one has an increased enthusiasm for life (more zest) until that increased enthusiasm is a reality (thus, an increase in zest is a reality) . Another 2012 study demonstrated that groups that trained strengths (worked to cultivate these strengths) which are highly correlated with life satisfaction (including zest), had significant improvements in self- reported life satisfaction post-test (after training those strengths). Zest can be an important characteristic to cultivate life satisfaction, thereby acting as a potential buffer against mental illness.

QVC Network, Inc., 637 A.2d 34 (Del. 1994), the Delaware Supreme Court clarified the type of transaction that triggers Revlon duties.  Facts  This case involved a proposed merger between Viacom and Paramount Communications; as part of the merger agreement, Paramount agreed to an array of defensive measures, including a no-shop provision, $100 million termination fee and a lock-up option on approximately 20% of Paramount’s common stock. However, QVC intervened with its own, facially more generous merger proposal, conditioned on cancellation of the defensive measures. The Paramount board refused to conduct a formal bidding process with QVC on the grounds that it would be inconsistent with its contractual obligations to Viacom.  Holding  ;Revlon triggers :When a corporation undertakes a transaction which will cause (a) a change in corporate control, or (b) a break-up of the corporate entity, the directors' obligation is to seek the best value reasonably available to the stockholders ;Burden of proof :The \\"directors have the burden of proving that they were adequately informed and acted reasonably.\\" ;Key features of the enhanced scrutiny test :The courts will look into the adequacy of the directors’ decision making process, including what information they used in coming to their decision.

The unique characteristic of the bridge is that it was cut out from a single solid piece of rock hundred years of age. The bridge is a little carved in shape.

Like many hotels of the era, the property was built in close proximity of a B&O; train station and was constructed to provide lodging to railroad passengers. and Accompanying four photos Original hotel Originally the five story hotel was built in the shape of an \\"L\\", with a rear one-story kitchen wing. It contained 102 rooms and 45 baths. The lowest level contained a barber-shop, cafeteria, candy shop and men's furnishing shop. In 1929 an additional wing was added to the hotel, which provided 50 more guestrooms. In 1950 the property was remodeled to include a Howard Johnson's restaurant. The property remained a vital part of downtown Winchester, Virginia and has in the past been home to the headquarters of the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival. Over the years, a number of notable people have stayed at The George Washington Hotel. Guests have included Lucille Ball and Jack Dempsey among many others. Changing times With the construction of interstate highways and widespread availability of motor cars, railroad travel began to decline. Undoubtedly, this change in travel, contributed to the closing of the property in 1978. It was then operated as The George Washington Home for Adults from 1978 to 1993. The property then lay vacant until 2004. That year it was purchased and renovation work began which lasted until the property reopened in April 2008. The property has undergone a complete renovation and revitalization. It now includes 90 guestrooms, an indoor pool and hot tub, fitness room, restaurant \\"Georges Food And Spirits\\". It operates under the name The George Washington Hotel – A Wyndham Grand Hotel. The property contains all the amenities of today, while capturing the historical elements which make it so unique.

She was requisitioned for use as a troopship in the Second World War, surviving a torpedo attack. In 1953 she was requisitioned by the Ministry of Troop Transport (MoTT) and renamed Empire Clyde. She was scrapped in 1957. Description The ship was built by William Beardmore & Co Ltd, Port Glasgow as yard number 584. She was launched on 23 December 1919, and completed in September 1920. The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She had a and . She was propelled by six Beardmore-built steam turbines, double reduction geared, driving twin screw propellors. which could propel her at . History =Pre war= Cameronia was built for the Anchor Line, which was owned by Cunard Line. She was a sister ship to . Although she was launched in December 1919, a strike delayed her final completion. In April 1921, Cameronia was towed to Cherbourg, France for final fitting out. She had accommodation for 265 1st class, 370 2nd class and 1,100 3rd class passengers. Cameronia departed Glasgow on 11 May 1921 on her maiden voyage to Liverpool and New York. Cameronia was placed under the management of the Henderson Brothers Ltd. Her port of registry was Glasgow. Her UK official number was 144242 and until 1933 her code letters were KHSQ. In October 1925, Cameronia rescued the crew of a United States Coast Guard cutter that had caught fire. She was in collision with the Norwegian steamship the following month. Her steering gear failed on a voyage in January 1926 and she returned to Glasgow for repairs. In August 1926, a collision with Cunard's was avoided by . Cameronia underwent a refit in 1928 to correct her tendency to pitch heavily. In 1929 another refit saw her accommodation refitted to cabin/tourist class. She now had accommodation for 290 cabin class, 431 tourist class and 698 3rd class passengers. In 1934, Cameronia's code letters were superseded by the call sign GDXS. She was laid up on the Clyde in December 1934. In 1935, the Anchor Line went into liquidation, and Cameronia was one of the assets purchased by Anchor Line (1935) Ltd. She remained laid up until the autumn of 1935, when she entered service as a troopship. In spring 1936, she was again refitted and returned to use as an ocean liner. Cameronia participated in the 1937 Spithead Naval Review, where she was used as a floating grandstand. =Second World War= War was declared in September 1939. Cameronia departed Glasgow on 5 September. During the voyage to New York, she rescued some of the survivors from , and was the first British ship to enter New York after war had been declared. Cameronia returned to the United Kingdom as part of Convoy HXF 1, which departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 19 September 1939 and arrived at Liverpool on 29 September. Cameronia was bound for Glasgow. She made eleven unescorted round trips from Glasgow – New York in the period to December 1940, when she was requisitioned for use as a troopship. On 29 January 1941, Cameronia joined Convoy WS 5B at Freetown, Sierra Leone, sailing with the convoy to the Suez Canal, where she arrived on 3 March. Cameronia was a member of Convoy GA 10, which arrived at Alexandria, Egypt on 6 April 1941. On 23 March 1942, Cameronia departed the United Kingdom as a member of Convoy WS17, bound for Freetown. She departed Freetown on 11 April as part of Convoy WS17B bound for Cape Town, South Africa, arriving on 23 April. On 27 April, Cameronia departed Cape Town as part of Convoy WS 17 bound for Mombasa, Kenya, where she arrived on 8 May. On 10 May Cameronia departed Mombasa as part of Convoy WS 17BZ, arriving at Bombay, India on 19 May. On 29–30 May 1941 in company with the Glen Line's Glengyle 6,000 Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were evacuated from Sphakia at the end of the Battle of Crete.

A hole was blown in Cameronia's side and 17 people were killed. also claimed to have damaged her. Cameronia managed to reach the port of Bougie, Algeria, from where she was escorted at to Algiers. She then sailed to Gibraltar where temporary repairs were carried out. Cameronia then sailed to Glasgow for permanent repairs. Repairs were completed in June 1943 and Cameronia was then returned to service. On 29 August 1943, Cameronia departed Gibraltar as part of Convoy MKF 22, which had departed from Port Said, Egypt on 19 August and arrived at the Clyde on 9 September. On 6 December 1943, Cameronia departed Oran, Algeria with members of the 21st General Hospital. They were landed at Naples, Italy on 21 December. Cameronia was the largest troopship that took part in Operation Overlord in June 1944. She served until the end of the war, when she was laid up. =Post war= In 1947, Cameronia was returned to service on trooping duties to Palestine. In 1948, she was refitted by Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd, Elderslie, giving her accommodation for 1,266 passengers in a single class. She was used to transport people emigrating to Australia. In 1953, Cameronia was sold to the MoTT and was renamed Empire Clyde, with some sources referring to her as ‘HTS’ Empire Clyde, remaining under the management of Anchor Line. She served until 1957, arriving on 22 October at Newport, Monmouthshire for scrapping.
