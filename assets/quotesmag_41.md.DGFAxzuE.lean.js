The \\"no nit\\" policy requires the sending home and barring of all children who have nits(egg shells) on their hair from controlled settings such as school, summer camp or day care facilities. The CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) advocate that \\"no-nit\\" policies should be discontinued, due in part because nits, the eggs or empty egg shells, are not transmissible and the burden of unnecessary absenteeism to the students, families and communities far outweighs the risks associated with head lice. Nits A nit is the egg of a louse. They are white, resembling dandruff, and 0.8 mm long. They cement to the hair base where they are difficult to remove, and may survive for three weeks away from the host. In British and Irish slang the term \\"nit\\" commonly refers to a head louse. Only the presence of live crawling lice (nymph or imago) constitutes an infestation. Much of the controversy surrounding school head lice policy centers on the question of what to do with children discovered to have nits, but no visible lice. Indeed, one-third to three- fourths of children with nits fall into this category. The nits-only population therefore represents a significant fraction of children potentially subject to school exclusion and/or treatment with insecticides. Such children have evidence of infestation (i.e., the nits), but the infestation may be extinct. Unfortunately, false negative conclusions (i.e., failing to find lice that are, in fact, present) regarding infestation have long been recognized as a problem in head lice diagnosis. Depending on the methods used, live lice can be easily missed during inspection. For example, a 1998 Israeli study found that 76% of live lice infestations were missed by visual inspection (as verified by subsequent combing methods). Although lice cannot fly or jump, they are fast and agile in their native environment (i.e., clinging to hairs near the warmth of the scalp), and will try to avoid the light used during inspection. Lice populations are also sparse, which can contribute to difficulty in finding live specimens. Two-thirds of infestations are composed of 10 or fewer individual lice. Further, lice populations consist predominantly (80%-90%) of immature nymphs, which are even smaller and harder to detect than adult lice. These difficulties have, at times, led to the recommendation that the presence of nits alone be used to infer infestation:Head louse nits on human hair A 1998 American study attempted to clarify the infestation risk associated with a \\"nits-only\\" diagnosis. They found that 18% of children with nits (but no apparent lice) became infested (i.e., lice appeared) 14 days later. Whether these new lice came from viable eggs or via transmission from other hosts was not clear. Transmission from other hosts would tend to overestimate the infestation risk associated with nits. In addition, some children were treated with pediculicides during this 14-day period. Successful treatments (i.e., killing eggs or recently hatched nymphs) tend to underestimate the infestation risk associated with nits. These limitations of the study notwithstanding, the authors concluded: Although \\"nits-only\\" children are unlikely to become infested, this is not to say that a nit-free population is without value. Much of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing head lice stems from the possibility that observed nits are due to an extinct infestation. However, if a policy of required nit removal is enforced, this is no longer an issue. Against a background of nit-free children, spotting new infestations through routine screening becomes as easy as spotting the nits. This ease in screening comes at a price, though, namely the effort expended (typically by parents) in removing nits. And to the extent that no-nit policies result in absenteeism, the child's education suffers, and the school's funding (e.g., from government sources) may be reduced. Inspection A 1991 survey of American nurses reported that 27% have regular inspection programs in place at their schools. 85% reported inspection on an \\"as-needed\\" basis. Routine inspection of children is advocated by a variety of nurses, researchers, organizations, and governments. Head lice cannot live more than a day or two away from a host. Any remaining eggs will hatch in one to two weeks, and absent a host, the emerging nymphs will die within hours. Thus, simply leaving the school vacant for a week or two is sufficient to disinfect all fomite sources of head louse infection. The return of children to this now-clean environment is an ideal time to check for infestations and attempt to keep the environment lice-free. The California Department of Public Health encourages inspections to be performed on Fridays. Some health researchers oppose regular inspections. This opposition to school inspections coincides with opposition to no-nit policies, and is based on similar reasoning (i.e., that they are ineffective). Lice infestation is not a reportable disease, so data on head lice incidence are sparse. , no control- matched study exists on the effect of school screening programs on head lice prevalence. Further, although some authors note a stubborn prevalence of head lice during the latter half of the 20th century, this has occurred in an environment of rather lax screening efforts. For example, a 1991 survey of American nurses reported that only 27% had regular screening programs in place at their schools. Anecdotal evidence suggests that school screening programs can reduce head lice prevalence. Certainly, the effectiveness of these programs must be determined before their cost effectiveness can be evaluated. Barbara Frankowski, a critic of school screenings, argues that time spent screening children by school nurses is better spent on other tasks. This attitude reflects those held by some American school nurses themselves, 27% of whom believe that eliminating lice infestations in not an important role of school nursing. Even more telling, only 11% of American school nurses find treating head lice to be professionally gratifying. Similar attitudes exist among Canadian school nurses. School inspections are often short‚Äîabout one minute per child. Frankowski argues that such inspections are not thorough enough to be accurate, and so may lead to a false sense of security. Indeed, a 1998 study of Israeli children found that live lice took an average of 57 ‚Äì 116 seconds to detect depending on the technique used. L. Keoki Williams and others acknowledge this shortcoming of school screening, and suggest that children found to have nits undergo an additional 5- to 10-minute examination to exclude the presence of live lice. In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues not for increased inspection time, but elimination of the school screenings altogether, with parents being educated and encouraged to inspect their own children at home. This attitude, coupled with the AAP's opposition to the no-nit policy, would essentially absolve school administrators of responsibility to directly manage pediculosis in their student body. Discovery of infested students =Immediate exclusion from school= Discovery of infested students typically occurs during a school day. Assuming the presence of live lice is the criteria used to infer infestation, an ethical dilemma is presented to school nurses and administrators. Should this student, now known to be infectious, be returned to class where transmission to other students could occur? Or alternatively, should the student be immediately removed from the group setting? Schools have very limited capacity to individually supervise students outside of the classroom, so removal from the classroom means requesting that the child's parents pick up their child. Parents often become upset when the school nurse telephones their place of employment to inform them of their child's infestation and to request they come and collect their child. Nonetheless, immediate exclusion policies are explicitly advocated by some nurses. A 1998 survey revealed that almost all (96%) American school nurses send home infested students upon discovery. Opponents to immediate exclusion policies point out that the discovery of infestation is merely recognition of what has been an infectious condition for a number of months. Given that context, they argue, one more day of group contact is unlikely to result in more transmission than has already occurred. This contrasts with more short-term and highly communicable viral diseases such as chickenpox, influenza, or measles where immediate exclusion might reasonably reduce disease spread within the school. The value of immediate exclusion for lice depends to some extent on the frequency of asymptomatic screening at the school. More frequent screening would tend to decrease the average time between infestation and discovery of that infestation. This would make the one day associated with immediate exclusion a more significant fraction of the total time the student was infectious. But even ardent supporters of asymptomatic screening do not advocate screenings more than once every three months. This suggests that the effect of immediate exclusion might be an exposure time reduction of as little as 1.6%, even under strict screening guidelines.Three months includes approximately 90 days, which in turn includes approximately 64 weekdays. One out of 64 days is 0.0156 or 1.6%. These changing attitudes on immediate exclusion appear to be affecting public policy. For example, in Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council states that infested children need not be sent home upon discovery. Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a head lice policy that does not immediately exclude infested children. =Communicability in school settings= Evaluating immediate exclusion policies is difficult, because the communicability of head lice in school settings has not been carefully studied. This has not, however, prevented authors from confidently asserting their opinion: Two studies have noted clustering of head louse infestation by classroom. However, the authors differ in their interpretation of this clustering. In 1997, Richard Speare and Petra Buettner noted prevalence ranges of 0% to 72.2% across classrooms in the same grade (3rd) and in the same Australian school. This led them to favor the idea that \\"opportunities for transmission are prominent within the classroom\\". Indeed, their data suggest that classrooms synchronize in terms of infestation status. In contrast, Janis Hootman suggests that school communicability is low. In 1998 she found that infestations within American classrooms were restricted to a minority of chronically infested students. Hootman concluded that the infested students have access to an infectious source that their classmates do not. Similarly, she found that clusters of pediculosis within classrooms were associated with social interactions outside school (e.g., sleepovers). This indicates that transmission can occur between classmates, but again, these transmission events may be occurring away from school grounds. Barring return to school After identifying and isolating an infested student, school policy typically requires some sort of verification that the student is no longer infectious before being readmitted to the school. Typically, this involves inspecting the child for evidence of continued infestation (see Criteria to infer infestation above). Schools commonly enforce either a \\"no-nit\\" policy or a \\"no-lice\\" policy. =The no-nit policy= The consensus has been changed more recently and the \\"\\"no-nit\\" policy is considered worse than the nits themselves to a child's education and family burden the missed days cause. The EPA, CDC, and NASN all agree \\"no-nit\\" policies should be done away with and that students should remain in school the entire day. even if lice is found, and parents should be notified so they can treat it at home.https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/managing- head-lice.pdf No-nit policies bar readmission of students found to have lice, eggs, or nits. This policy is popular with health authorities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A 1998 survey revealed that a majority (61%) of American school nurses prevent return of treated students to school if they are not (also) nit-free. A similar percentage (60%) felt that \\"forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea.\\" Data from a primarily American study during 1998‚Äì1999 revealed even higher prevalence‚Äîno-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation. James H. Price and colleagues estimate that infested students lose two to four days of school for treatment and nit removal. Based on their 1998 survey of American school nurses, they estimate that approximately 6 million U.S. children lose 12 to 24 million child-schooldays annually due to lice infestation under no-nit policies. Controversy surrounding no-nit policy Although the no-nit policy has the appearance of a simple and popular tool against pediculosis transmission, its implementation has been opposed by a number of health researchers and organizations. Opponents argue that enforcement of no-nit policies has not significantly reduced head lice incidence in school settings, and that the risks and disadvantages of the no-nit policies outweigh their associated benefits. As is the case in assessing school screening efforts (see Screening above), assessing the effectiveness of no-nit policies is complicated by the sparseness of head lice prevalence data. To the extent that no-nit policies increase the efficiency of school screening programs (see Benefits of nit-free population above), no-nit policies may lead to more rapid containment of head lice outbreaks. However, , the correlation between no-nit policies and head lice incidence has not been examined. The no nit policy involves a number of issues, such as the circumstances under which children will be inspected, the criteria to infer infestation, the procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery, and the criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school. These issues are controversial. In particular, a number of health researchers and organizations object to the required removal of nits. Opponents to the no-nit policy point out that nits, being empty eggshells, have no clinical importance. Time-consuming nit removal, therefore, has no direct effect on transmission. This has led to the perception that the no-nit policy serves only to ease the workload of school nurses. Proponents of the no-nit policy counter that only a consistently nit-free child can be reliably shown to be infestation-free. That is, the presence of nits serves as a proxy for infestation status. Proponents argue that such a proxy is necessary because lice screening is prone to false negative conclusions (i.e., failure to find lice present on actively infested children). Contributing to the controversial nature of school head lice policies is a lack of available data on their importance and efficacy. For example, , the transmissibility of head lice in school settings is largely unknown. Further, control-matched studies of the effect of specific school policies on head lice incidence are also lacking. Schools in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. Policies in the United Kingdom extend to legal action against parents of infested students although the NHS does not recommend exclusion from school. Attitudes in developing countries are often quite different. Many societies consider head louse infestation to be normal, if even remarked upon at all. Inherent conflict over no-nit policy Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and colleagues indict required nit removal policies as an attempt to minimize the effort expended by school nurses on differentiating active and extinct infestations. They further argue that this minimization comes at the expense of excessive efforts on the part of parents to remove signs of previous infestations (i.e., the nits), which have no clinical importance. The difficulty parents face in advocating more lax attitudes towards children with nits, is that the parents have no concomitant guarantee from school administrators that those admitted children will truly be lice-free. Indeed, admitting children with nits increases the difficulty in identifying actively infested students (see Criteria to infer infestation above). In contrast to diseases such as measles or influenza, pediculosis does not inherently prevent school attendance. The financial incentive for schools, therefore, is to minimize expenditures on lice control and screening programs because (absent a no-nit policy) they have little effect on attendance. This is a formula for maximizing lice infestation within the student body, not minimizing it. Thus, while the no-nit policy may be seen as off-loading school nurse responsibilities to parents, it is perhaps more correctly viewed as imposing parental priorities on school administrators. In the absence of such policies, school and parental priorities with respect to lice are inherently at odds. The parents wish to minimize lice transmission. In contrast, schools wish to maximize attendance, which is largely unaffected by lice transmission. Barring return of children until nits are removed has the effect of transforming the pediculosis \\"problem\\" for which schools have no inherent incentive to solve, into an attendance \\"problem\\" for which schools have a direct financial interest. Unfortunately, the solution advocated by many to this attendance \\"problem\\" is to simply remove the no-nit policy, leaving the inherent conflict between parents and school administrators unaddressed. =The no-lice policy= The no-lice policy bars readmission of students with crawling lice, but are indifferent to the presence of eggs and nits. These policies are advocated by a number of government agencies, but , no data on the overall prevalence of no-lice policies exists. In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council states that treated children can return with nits so long as they are lice-free. Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a policy that permits students to return to school with nits Although this has not stopped the Beverly Hills school district from reintroducing a no-nit policy. History In 1902, Lina Struthers was appointed on an experimental basis, as a member of the relatively recently recognized profession of professional nurses. Pioneers of the profession became the first public health policy and health communication experts, serving to promote public understanding of disease prevention, which became critical after a smallpox outbreak in New York City caused widespread public panic and school absenteeism. Within one month Struthers had reduced absenteeism by a factor of 10. Struthers recommended the best treatments of her time for head lice, which included kerosene and \\"precipitating ointment,\\" a mercury salt. Reminding the reader that these treatments weren't very reliable, she advocated shaving the head or, in the case of older girls with long hair who would generally refuse this, manually removing the nits as a second-line treatment. Lindane was approved in 1981 for the treatment of head lice. There were significant health risks associated with the drug; however, it remains an effective second-line treatment. The Over-the-Counter approval of Nix Permethrin 1% topical lotion in 1990 and subsequent marketing approval in 1996 for prophylaxis provided a new way to combat lice. Resistance has occurred with these treatments that may necessitate protracted courses of treatment with multiple drugs.

The company slowly expanded during the 1960s and 1970s. By 1983, Syms had taken the company public with an initial public offering and expanded the chain to include eleven retail locations. At its height, the chain had 48 locations in thirteen states.

Enlaces was started in 1992 by Chile's Ministry of Education. Test phase The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in Santiago, the capital of Chile. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the Araucan√≠a Region, (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program. When the government decided that this project was viable, it focused all of its efforts on the spread of this program to all the regions of the country. First phase From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, computers, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training. In 2003, in order to continue their efforts to connect the country, the Ministry of Education signed an agreement with local telecommunication companies to offer low-cost broadband connection for educational institutions. Sixty percent of the students in Chile have access to broadband internet because of this agreement. In 2007, the Enlaces Program had 3,372,943 students, and 95% of the students in the country have access to computer. Future plans In 2007, the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom. That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration. The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile. Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions. Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are electronic whiteboards for math, palm pilots or pocket PCs for physics, and projectors for teaching sciences. Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010. The science program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI (hypothesis, experimentation, instruction) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet. This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for chemistry, and animals for dissection for biology) that many schools in Chile face. =Adult Education= Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through adult education. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally. For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a word processor, how to use the internet, and how to create and use an email account.

The district is the only continuously intact commercial district remaining along East Jefferson Avenue, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Historic Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers Business District is one of a few early twentieth-century neighborhood commercial districts that is still surviving in Detroit.THE EASTSIDE‚ÄôS BIGGEST SUMMER STREET PARTY EXPANDS TO TWO DAYS -- JUNE 22 and 23 from Tell Us Detroit During the 1920s, this district along Jefferson was the center of the east-side neighborhood's commercial, social, and cultural life. The district is unique in that two big-band era ballrooms, the cultural fulcrums of the early 20th century social scene, still exist within the district: the Monticello and the Vanity Ballroom. Nomenclature The Jefferson East neighborhood of Detroit is bounded by Alter Road on the east, St. Jean Street on the west, Charlevoix Street on the north, and the Detroit River on the south.Jefferson East Business Association (JEBA) from ModelD Jefferson Avenue runs approximately through the center of the Jefferson East neighborhood, and is primarily commercial in nature for thirteen blocks from Dickerson Street to Alter Road. This section of Jefferson Avenue is also known as the Jefferson East Business District. Historically significant structures exist along Jefferson Avenue for eight blocks from Conner to Alter Road; this section of the Jefferson East Business District is designated as the Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers Historic Business District. History East Jefferson Avenue was originally an Indian trail running along the Detroit River. As French settlers established ribbon farms along the river in the 1700s, the trail morphed into what is now River Road, connecting the farms with Fort Detroit. The area that is now within this district was, at the time, a marshy section surrounding Fox Creek, and therefore was relatively sparsely settled. In the 1800s, the Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers area gradually became more agricultural, as the swamp was drained. In 1851, a plank road was built along Jefferson, from Detroit to Grosse Pointe, with a toll bridge over Fox Creek. Roadhouses were built along the road including, by 1876, a saloon, located on the south side of East Jefferson Avenue near Fox Creek, within what is now this historic district. Other roadhouses were established in the area during the later 1800s. In 1874, draining of the surrounding swamp began in earnest, spurred in part by prominent Detroit attorney William B. Moran, who owned much of the land. By the 1880s, Moran had built Edgewood Road (now Alter) to access his summer resort on the river. In 1891, a streetcar line was built through the district, connecting Detroit and Grosse Pointe. That same year, the land in the district began to be subdivided, and by 1893, a number of streets crossing Jefferson had been platted. However, by the early 1900s, only a handful of houses had been constructed. In 1907, the area was annexed to Detroit, and by 1910 a number of industrial concerns had been established in the Connor Creek area, just west of the district. The rise of industry ushered in a rapid influx of residents, and the Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers Historic Business District began to grow rapidly as a result. By 1913, a number of commercial buildings had been constructed in the district, including the 1912 W.J. Hiller Building (14350-56 E. Jefferson), one of the oldest buildings still existing in the district. Businesses included a tailor, hardware store, drug store, physicians, grocers, and dry goods. Also by 1913, the small frame wooden structure St. Columba church (1913-2003) was constructed on Manistique. 1915 brought an explosion of development in the Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers area, with a string of commercial buildings, constructed along Jefferson. Automobile-related businesses also were constructed in the district in the later 1910s, as well as religious buildings. New development continued in the surrounding neighborhoods into the 1920s, spurred by the Chrysler Motor Company's construction of a huge nearby factory. A number of apartments were built in the district to house the influx of workers. The Great Depression ended the construction boom in the district, but business began to revive later in the 1930s with the establishment of stores in the area. The Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers area continued to thrive through the 1940s and 1950s, but in 1954 the nearby Hudson Motors plant closed, starting a slow decline in economic fortunes. The loss of jobs was exacerbated by the loss of residents, as more people left Detroit for the nearby suburbs. The decline lasted through the 1970s, and into the 1980s. During the 1990s, there was reinvestment in the area, with new residential and retail construction growth. The district has recently seen a resurgence, with a Michigan Cool Cities grant,Michigan Cool Cities Pilot Program Executive Summary--Jefferson East Business Association five million dollars worth of streetscape improvements, and rehabilitation of a number of anchor buildings in the district, such as the Platte Warehouse at Jefferson and Ashland, and the Chalmers Building at Jefferson and Chalmers.Santiago Esparza, \\"Far east side revels in its revitalization,\\" The Detroit News, June 23, 2007 Description Jefferson streetscape in 2008, looking east from Newport The Jefferson‚ÄìChalmers Historic Business District contains 57 buildings bordering East Jefferson Avenue, running for eight blocks between Eastlawn Street and Alter Road, at the border between Detroit and Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan.

The Tongmenghui revolutionary organization led by Sun Yat-sen was the first to promote socialism in China.  Organizations  The Tongmenghui and its successor, the Kuomintang party were the first to develop socialist ideology in China.  History  One of the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, Minsheng, was defined as People's Livelihood by Sun Yat-sen. The concept may be understood as social welfare as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker Henry George (see Georgism) and British thinker Bertrand Russell; the land value tax in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal Chinese government can take care of these for its people. The Kuomintang was referred to having a socialist ideology. \\"Equalization of land rights\\" was a clause included by Sun in the original Tongmenhui. The Kuomintang's revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese socialism as part of its ideology. The Soviet Union trained Kuomintang revolutionaries in the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the \\"Red General\\". Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang, at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University Portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls and in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and other socialist leaders. The Kuomintang attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in Canton and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's volunteer corps. Sun initiated this anti-merchant policy and Chiang enforced it, Chiang led his army of Whampoa Military Academy graduates to defeat the merchant army. Chiang was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries. The Kuomintang were accused of leading a \\"Red Revolution\\" in Canton. The merchants were conservative and reactionary and their Volunteer Corp leader Chen Lianbao was a prominent comprador trader. The merchants were supported by the foreign, Western imperialists such as the British, who led an international flotilla to support them against Sun. Chiang seized the western supplied weapons from the merchants, and battled against them. A Kuomintang General executed several merchants, and the Kuomintang formed a Soviet inspired Revolutionary Committee. The Communist Party of Great Britain congratulated Sun for his war against foreign imperialists and capitalists. Even after Chiang turned on the Soviet Union and massacred the communists, he still continued anti-capitalist activities and promoting revolutionary thought, accusing the merchants of being reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries. The United States consulate and other westerners in Shanghai was concerned about the approach of \\"Red General\\" Chiang as his army was seizing control in the Northern Expedition. Chiang also confronted and dominated the merchants of Shanghai in 1927, seizing loans from them, with the threats of death or exile. Rich merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs were arrested by Chiang, who accused them of being \\"counterrevolutionary\\", and Chiang held them until they gave money to the Kuomintang. Chiang arrests targeted rich millionaires, accusing them of communism and counterrevolutionary activities. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending his agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese made items, fining them. Chiang also disregarded the Internationally protected International Settlement, putting cages on its borders, threatening to have the merchants placed in there. He terrorized the merchant community. The Kuomintang's alliance with the Green Gang allowed it to ignore the borders of the foreign concessions. The Kuomintang repeatedly attempted land reform in China. On 8 January 1933, Chiang Kai-Shek established the Chinese Institute of Land Economics, under the 1932 \\"Ten Principles for promoting Party Land Policy\\", to \\"Regulate land ownership rights\\", \\"Establish a system of equal land rights\\", \\"Advance land use\\", \\"Establish land governance organisations\\", to facilitate land redistribution. United States Ambassador Patrick Hurley declared that the difference between the Communists and Nationalists were no greater than those between the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States.Russel D. Buhite, Patrick J. Hurley and American Foreign Policy (Ithaca, NY: Cornell U Press, 1973), 160 ‚Äì 162. In 1948, a new currency was introduced, the Gold Yuan, purchaseable for gold or silver. Information was leaked and there was a wave of chaos from speculation. The Kuomintang again curbed the merchants of Shanghai, and Chiang sent his son Chiang Ching-kuo to restore economic order. Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods which he learned during his stay there to start a social revolution by targeting middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the proletariat. This however caused a hoarding frenzy. The value of the Yuan plunged and many became destitute. As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Ching-kuo began to pursue the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered Kuomintang agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by H. H. Kung and his family. H. H. Kung's wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong Mei- ling who was Ching-kuo's stepmother. H. H. Kung's son David was arrested, the Kung's responded by blackmailing the Chiangs, threatening to release information about them, eventually he was freed after negotiations, and Ching- kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants. General Ma Bufang, the Kuomintang Muslim Governor of Qinghai, was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick. An American scholar and government advisor, A. Doak Barnett, praised Ma Bufang's government as \\"one of the most efficient in China, and one of the most energetic. While most of China is bogged down, almost inevitably, by Civil War, Chinghai is attempting to carry out small-scale, but nevertheless ambitious, development and reconstruction schemes on its own initiative\\". General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists. His regime was dictatorial in its political system. Barnett admitted that the regime had \\"stern authoritarianism\\" and \\"little room for personal freedom\\".  Ideology  The Kuomintang also promotes government-owned corporations. The Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen, was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Henry George, who believed that the rents extracted from natural monopolies or the usage of land belonged to the public. Dr. Sun argued for Georgism and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy, which he termed \\"The Principle of Minsheng\\" in his Three Principles of the People and proclaiming: \\"The railroads, public utilities, canals, and forests should be nationalized, and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State. With this money in hand, the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs\\".Simei Qing \\"From Allies to Enemies\\", p. 19. Ma Hongkui, the Kuomintang Muslim Governor of Ningxia, promoted state owned monopoly companies. His government had a company, Fu Ning Company, which had a monopoly over commercial and industry in Ningxia. The Chinese Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed southern Xinjiang from 1934‚Äì1937. The General Ma Hushan was chief of the 36th Division. The Chinese Muslims operated state-owned carpet factories. Corporations such as CSBC Corporation, Taiwan, CPC Corporation, Taiwan and Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation are owned by the state in the Republic of China. The Kuomintang government under Sun and Chiang denounced feudalism as counterrevolutionary. They proudly proclaimed themselves to be revolutionary. Chiang called the warlords feudalists and called for feudalism and counterrevolutionaries to be stamped out by the Kuomintang. Chiang showed extreme rage when he was called a warlord, because of its negative, feudal connotations. The Blue Shirts were a fascist paramilitary organization within the Kuomintang modeled after Benito Mussolini's blackshirts, and were anti-communist and rigorously nationalist. The intended goal of the Blue shirts was to destroy the Communists, \\"suppress feudal influences\\" and \\"deal with foreign insults\\". In addition to being anti- communist, some Kuomintang members, like Chiang Kai-shek's right-hand man Dai Li were anti-American, and they wanted to expel American influence. Marxists also existed in the Kuomintang party. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists, claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang did not always agree with the Chinese Communist Party ideology.  Implementation  = Chiang Kai-shek = Contrary to the view that he was pro-capitalist, Chiang Kai-shek behaved in an antagonistic manner to the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for the use of the government, even while he was fighting the communists. Chiang crushed pro-communist worker and peasant organizations and the rich Shanghai capitalists at the same time. Chiang continued Sun's anti-capitalist ideology; Kuomintang media openly attacked the capitalists and capitalism, demanding government-controlled industry instead. Chiang blocked the capitalists from gaining any political power or voice in his regime. Once Chiang was done with his original rampage and \\"reign of terror\\" on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. Gangster connections allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, to force capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expenditures.  Support  Revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Sun, his attempts on social reformation and congratulated him for fighting foreign imperialism. Sun also returned the praise, calling him a \\"great man\\" and sent his congratulations on the revolution in Russia.  Influence  The Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng, also known as the Vietnamese Kuomintang, was based on the Kuomintang and one part of its ideology was socialism. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) was founded in 1948 by left-wing members who broke with the main Kuomintang during the Chinese Civil War. The RCCK is now one of nine registered political parties in the People's Republic of China.  Constitution of the Republic of China  The Three Principles of the People are officially the ideology of the Republic of China as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of China. M√≠nshƒìng, defined as People's Livelihood, is one of these principles.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). Page 685. McGraw-Hill. . In addition to those mechanisms, the skin not getting enough exposure to air also contributes to the formation of acne mechanica. It is often mistaken as a rash that forms on sweaty skin that is constantly being rubbed, but in reality, it is a breakout of acne mechanica. The term \\"acne\\" itself describes the occurrence in which hair follicles (also known as pores) in the skin get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, dirt and bacteria, or cosmetic products and create a pimple. Pimples can vary in type, size, and shape, but the sole basis of them occurring is the same - the oil gland in the pore becomes clogged and sometimes infected, which creates pus in order to fight the infection and subsequently causes the development of swollen, red lesions on the skin.  Signs and symptoms  The signs and symptoms at an early stage are harder to be seen. At first look, acne mechanica seems very similar to any other type of acne. However, it differs in how it is caused. A lot of acne has to do with hormones, the amount of oil production in the skin, and genetic predispositions. Acne mechanica specifically refers to the skin irritation that is formed by excess pressure, heat, and rubbing against the skin. When the skin is constantly rubbed, it initially becomes rough and then starts to develop acne-like bumps with continuing irritation like sweating or more friction. If the skin continues to be irritated for a longer period of time, a more serious acne lesion develops that grows in size and redness. They appear as small, red tender bumps called papules. There may be a combination of whiteheads and blackheads that also appear around the area affected, the difference being that whiteheads are closed and clogged pores whereas blackheads are also clogged but open pores. The symptoms may vary also depending on a person's skin type; overly oily or dry skin can cause a number of symptoms that heighten the possibility for acne mechanica to develop.  Cause  Repetitive rubbing of the skin, in instances such as backpack strings rubbing on your shoulders or helmet straps rubbing on your chin are actions that can irritate the skin and cause acne mechanica. Acne mechanica is a specific type of acne that is caused by friction, heat, and/or pressure on the skin. Especially occurs when the skin is not exposed to air. It is commonly found in athletes because sweaty, constantly rubbed skin by a tight uniform, for example, can result in a rash. What may look like a rash is actually acne mechanica. Another common area for acne mechanica to show up is on the sides of your face where you hold your cell phone, especially with the added bacteria it carries on it. There are some people who are more prone to develop acne mechanica. The biggest group of people affected by this type of acne are teenagers and young adults in their twenties who already experience issues with acne on their back, shoulders, and buttocks. Other people who have a type of acne commonly described as \\"sandpaper acne,\\" which is characterized as small but rough acne lesions that are not very visible but feel like sandpaper to the touch, also are more prone to developing acne mechanica.  Mechanism  Acne mechanica specifically is triggered by both mechanical and heat stress on the skin working together to cause this irritation. The skin that is exposed to these stressors initially develops a harder surface to protect itself, but if the skin is continually dealing with this pressure, it gets irritated and forms a rash. At this point, it gets qualified as acne mechanica. When you are in a hot climate or are working out and your body temperature rises, the heat causes the pores in your skin to open up. The dilation of the pores makes it easier for bacteria, oil, and dead skin cells to collect in the pores and clog them. Every pore in your body has a tiny hair follicle, and the blockage causes the hair follicle to become irritated and inflamed, which ends up forming pimples; specifically acne mechanica. White blood cells flood the area of inflammation, and once they die, they accumulate on the surface of the pore, causing what is known as a ‚Äúwhitehead‚Äù. When people pop pimples, pus comes out, which has the dead white blood cells in it that originally came to diffuse the inflammation. Depending on the continuation of the stressors, the inflammatory pimples (also known as papules and pustules) can develop into nodules and cysts, which are more severe forms of acne that are rooted deeper within the skin.  Diagnosis  Acne mechanica can be diagnosed by a dermatologist via a physical examination. In more extreme cases, a skin biopsy is performed to examine the pathology. Family and medical history are also looked at to see if the patient has a hereditary tendency to certain conditions that cause different types of acne, which may play a role in acne mechanica development. For example, if a patient's parents had acne, there is a very strong probability they will also have similar issues. The issues can range from things like overproducing dead skin cells or the pores having a higher tendency to clog.  Treatment  Acne mechanica has no direct cure, however, there are preventive measures that can be taken to minimize its breakouts. The most obvious solution to prevent extra rubbing or heat entrapment on the surface of the skin is to wear either loose- fitting clothes or wearing clothes made out of more breathable fabrics, especially during exercising, playing sports, or when performing physical activities such as hiking. Loose clothes will not rub as much and create the mechanical stress on the skin. Instead of wearing clothes made out of polyester and rayon, choosing cotton materials will help relieve the heat stress on the skin and not trap sweat in the pores. Taking showers immediately after any form of physical exercise will also help keep the skin as clean as possible. Keeping up with a skin care regimen so the skin is moisturized helps as well. Using skin care products specifically with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide help exfoliate the skin in a gentle manner and get rid of bacteria. Both of these chemicals in a facial cleanser may create a tingling sensation on people with extremely sensitive skin. Other topical ointments can be used once consulted with a dermatologist.  Prognosis  Long term effects of acne mechanica include potential scarring and skin discoloration at the area of the acne lesion if rubbing of the skin continues. It is not a lethal condition and the acne will clear up on its own once the heat and pressure stressors are avoided and if the skin is kept clean so the pores do not continue to become clogged.  Epidemiology  Acne mechanica is most prevalent among athletes, soldiers in warm climates, teenagers and young adults. The athletes and soldiers can get rashes from their equipment and uniforms constantly rubbing their skin while sweating, which turn into acne mechanica lesions. Men tend to be more prone to develop acne mechanica because they produce more oil (also known as sebum) in their glands, even though their glands are actually smaller than women's. This is also a reason why men's acne tends to remain a problem for longer once its developed. Acne in general is hereditary from parents to child, so genetics play a factor as well. People who already have acne and have a problematic skin type that tends to create clogged pores are more likely to develop acne mechanica as well.  Research Directions  Although not exactly having to do with acne mechanica and the heat or pressure stressors that cause it, there is still not a lot of research relating to different organ's health relating to acne appearing on different areas of the body and face. A correlation between the two could be explored in future studies.

A very small and light biplane intended to fly off platforms on Royal Navy Destroyers, it was unsuccessful, only a single prototype being built. Design and development Following Royal Navy experience in operating land planes from platforms on ships, in late 1916, the British Admiralty came up with the idea of a lightweight fighter aircraft, capable of flying off short platforms on the forecastle of Destroyers in order to provide large numbers of aircraft at sea capable of intercepting and destroying German Airships. It therefore instructed the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain, and the RNAS Experimental Flight at Eastchurch to each produce a design to meet this requirement.Bruce 1965, p.180. The Port Victoria aircraft, designed by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It was a very small single bay tractor biplane, of sesquiplane configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45 hp (34 kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder air- cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.Collyer 1991, p.52.Mason 1992, p.111. While the Port Victoria design was designed and built, the commander of the Experimental flight as Eastchurch, Harry Busteed took over command of the Port Victoria Marine Aircraft Experimental Department, taking the designer of the Eastchurch competitor and the part built prototype with him to the Isle of Grain, with the Eastchurch design gaining the Port Victoria designation P.V.8. The P.V.7 acquired the name Grain Kitten to distinguish it from the P.V.8, which was named the Eastchurch Kitten. The P.V.7 first flew on 22 June 1917, powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) ungeared Gnat engine, as the geared engine was unavailable. The P.V.7 proved to be tail heavy in the air and difficult to handle on the ground, with its sesquiplane layout and high lift wings being considered unsuitable for such a small aircraft. The Gnat engine proved to be extremely unreliable, with test flights being forced to remain within gliding distance of an airfield. When the P.V.8 first flew in September, it proved superior, although similarly hamstrung by the 35 hp Gnat. The P.V.7 was rebuilt with new wings of conventional aerofoil section, a modified tail and a new undercarriage to eliminate some of the problems found in testing. The low power and unreliability of the Gnat, however, prevented either aircraft being suitable for the intended use, and the P.V.7 was not flown after it was rebuilt.Collyer 1991, p.53.

These domains failed to show accurate contact information or provided false details. In the complaint, which was filed in March 2007, in the US District Court in Denver, the high-end retailers sought damages of at least $100,000 per name.Jesdanun, Anick. Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman claimed that the registrars were taking advantage of their special status with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), to secure misspelled domains during the five-day grace period, and paying only for the ones with valuable revenue. This practice, called domain tasting, resulted in cybersquatting on various trademarked names. Neiman Marcus had accused the registrar Dotster in 2006 of the same infringement. Mushkin, however, denied the accusations of \\"domain tasting,\\" explaining that Name.com and Spot Domain were merely registrars, caught in the crossfire.

The word was coined by employee Jared Ewy and the original likeness was made by Owen Borseth using various images from the internet. Rightside filed a trademark on the Bearglecorn in early 2016, citing its first use in 2013. Philanthropy = Name.Gives = In November 2017, Name.com launched a philanthropy program called Name.Gives, funded by their parent company Donuts, Inc. Each quarter, Name.com employees have the opportunity to apply for funds to be donated to a charity or community organization they support. Organizations in the Denver-metro area that have been awarded with financial contributions in the past include SafeHouse Denver, the Special Olympics Denver Swim Team, Metro Caring, Rangeview High School Track and Field, and the Northfield High School Solar Rollers. = Other community programs = The company has supported several non-profits, including a small literary magazine in South Africa, Amazwi, and a local environmental organization, Environment Colorado.

Henry Hatch (June 13, 1900 ‚Äì April 4, 1964) was the equipment manager for the University of Michigan varsity sports programs for 43 years from 1921 to 1964. For many years, he lived with his wife and daughter in a house on the grounds of Michigan Stadium and was considered a legendary figure in Michigan sports history. The Hatch-Falk Award is named in his honor, and he was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1992. Hatch is responsible for the tradition of retiring Michigan Wolverines football jerseys and is part of the lore of the Little Brown Jug. Michigan's equipment manager for 45 years Hatch was hired as Michigan's equipment manager under legendary coach Fielding H. Yost. He held the position for 45 years until his death in 1964. He served under seven head football coaches, including Yost, Harry Kipke, Fritz Crisler and Bennie Oosterbaan. In its obituary on Hatch, the Associated Press described him as follows: \\"A stocky, white-haired man, Hatch was familiar to thousands of Michigan football fans as the man scampering on and off the stadium gridiron on game errands.\\" During his time as Michigan's equipment manager, Hatch became a legendary figure on campus. He worked out of the equipment room at Yost Arena and lived with his wife and daughter in a house on the grounds of Michigan Stadium. In a book by Jim Brandstatter published in 2002 about the stadium's history, Hatch's daughter recalled calling Michigan Stadium home 1952-1964. The house was located just outside the stadium walls but inside the fence at the south end of the stadium. Even though the football team played games there only seven or eight days a year, Hatch and his family lived on the stadium grounds 365 days a year. They watched over the stadium at night and were responsible for locking and unlocking the gates each day. Hatch was reportedly beloved by Michigan athletes. All-American Albert Wistert told a story about Hatch's kindness to him. Wistert's older brothers, Francis \\"Whitey\\" and Alvin, had also played for Michigan, and had been All-Americans wearing the No. 11 jersey. The youngest Wistert said he never asked for the No. 11 jersey, but Hatch had saved it for him. When Wistert picked up his uniform in 1940, Hatch reached under the counter and pulled out the No. 11 jersey. Wistert later recalled, \\"I never needed a pep talk after that. Every time I put on that jersey, that was all I needed.\\" Hatch and the tradition of retiring jerseys Hatch also began the tradition of retiring jersey numbers at Michigan. The first jersey Hatch retired was the No. 47 jersey worn by Bennie Oosterbaan. After Oosterbaan graduated in the 1920s, Hatch said, \\"Nobody's ever going to make All-American three years running again. I'm not going to give Bennie's number out.\\" As Tom Harmon finished his playing career at Michigan, Hatch decided Harmon's No. 98 jersey would join Oosterbaan's as the second to be retired. One newspaper reported: \\"Ol' 98 will be folded carefully and laid away to rest in the Michigan Niche of Fame. That is the decree announced by Henry Hatch, Ann Arbor equipment manager.\\" And when Harmon completed his final game, the United Press reported: \\"The book was closed on number 98 today, and Equipment Manager Henry Hatch of Michigan university put it reverently away in a musty trunk beside number 47.\\" The other of the four original retired numbers (see main image above) are No. 87, which belongs to Ron Kramer and No. 11, which belongs to the Wistert brothers. Little Brown Jug As Michigan's equipment manager, Hatch played a role in the early history of the Little Brown Jug, one of the most famous trophies in college athletics. In 1903, the Michigan Wolverines traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the unbeaten Wolverines played the unbeaten Minnesota Golden Gophers. At the end of the game (a 6-6 tie), the crowd poured onto the field, and Michigan left its earthenware water jug on the field. Michigan asked to have it returned, but Minnesota refused, saying Michigan would have to win the jug back. Michigan reclaimed the jug several years later. In 1919, Minnesota beat Michigan on the Wolverines' home field in Ann Arbor. When Minnesota asked for the symbolic trophy at the end of the game, Michigan officials said they could not locate it. Eventually, Hatch came up with it. Hatch recalled, \\"When Minnesota made such a fuss about getting it back, I started looking around and found it behind a clump of shrubbery near the gym. I shined it up and shipped it on to Doc Cooke.\\" Minnesota fans have long doubted Hatch's story, raising their suspicions that Hatch did not find the jug in a clump of shrubbery, but more likely \\"in a trophy case inside the gymnasium, easily dusted off and proudly brought back to Minnesota.\\" In the decades that followed, one of Hatch's jobs was to serve as the custodian of the jug during the time it was in Ann Arbor and to print each year's game score on the side of the jug. In 1953, the NEA wire service distributed a photograph of Hatch placing the score on the jug on the 50th anniversary of the first Little Brown Jug match. Death and honors Hatch died at his Ann Arbor, Michigan home in April 1964 of a heart attack, the day after being released from the hospital for surgery on an intestinal ailment. He was survived by his wife, Wanda, and his daughter, Patricia Ann. In 1993, Hatch was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. As a further tribute to Hatch, the University of Michigan Club of Greater Detroit presents the \\"Hatch-Falk Award\\" each year to the university's senior manager. The award is named after Henry Hatch and his successor, Jon Falk, and provides a full tuition grant to the current Senior Manager. The Award refers to Hatch as the \\"legendary Equipment Manager in the early years of Michigan Athletics.\\" Hatch was awarded an honorary varsity letter from the M Club (as W. Henry Hatch) for outstanding service to the Athletic Department.

At the time, McFarland was part owner of the Skye label, along with Latin percussionist Cal Tjader (who was Wendy and Bonnie's godfather) and jazz guitarist G√°bor Szab√≥. Wendy and Bonnie grew up in Millbrae, California, in the San Francisco Bay suburbs. Their parents, Art and Jeane Flower, were professional musicians. In 1967, Wendy played and recorded with an early San Francisco psychedelic band called Crystal Fountain; Bonnie later joined the band as drummer. The following year, Tjader heard some of the Flower sisters' acoustic home demos and arranged a recording session with Skye. The sisters, who were teens at the time the album was recorded, composed all the songs. McFarland served as arranger on the sessions, crafting a post-psychedelic soft rock sound with Brazilian overtones. Musicians who performed on the album included guitarist Larry Carlton, drummer Jim Keltner, and keyboardist Mike Melvoin. The Skye label went bankrupt shortly after the album's release. In 1971, while planning for additional recording with the Flower sisters, McFarland was murdered in mysterious circumstances in a New York bar. In the early 1970s, Wendy and Bonnie provided background vocals on two Cal Tjader albums for Fantasy Records. Thereafter, the sisters pursued separate careers in music and entertainment, but did not record together again. Genesis was reissued on CD in 2001 by the Sundazed Records label. In 2008, it was reissued in expanded format, including demos, alternate mixes, and vintage live recordings, on 2-CD and 3-LP vinyl sets. Their recording \\"By the Sea\\" was sampled by the Welsh space rock band Super Furry Animals on a single \\"Hello Sunshine,\\" which is also the opening track on the band's 2003 album Phantom Power.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's magazine Big Comic Original from 1985 to 1988, with the individual chapters collected into eight tank≈çbon volumes. The series initially takes place in New York, but because its editor believed the magazine's demographic was men in their 40s, the setting changes to Europe at a certain point. Viz Media licensed Pineapple Army for English release in North America, but it was canceled after only ten issues. The manga is also licensed in France by Gl√©nat, in Spain by Planeta DeAgostini Comics, and in Sweden by Epix F√∂rlag. Plot summary The series stars Japanese- American , a former United States Marine who served in the Vietnam War. After leaving the marines he fought all over the world as a mercenary, before retiring in 1979. Now living in New York, he makes a living training others in combat. Goshi does not discriminate against those he trains, whether its Bengali militiamen, salarymen, or four little girls. Publication Written by Kazuya Kudo and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa, Pineapple Army was serialized in the magazine Big Comic Original from 1985 to 1988. It is Urasawa's first major work and he would go on to draw Yawara! simultaneous with it. The individual chapters were collected into eight tank≈çbon by Shogakukan between March 29, 1986 and July 30, 1988. A six-volume bunkoban edition was published between November 17, 1995 and March 16, 1996. In 1988, Viz Media began publishing Pineapple Army in English in a chapterly comic book format. These had new cover art drawn in a drastically different art style by an unknown artist. But the run was unsuccessful and cancelled after ten issues were released. Although, one graphic novel collecting them was also published with an afterword by James D. Hudnall. =Volume list= Reception Manga critic Jason Thompson stated that Pineapple Army was a modest success in Japan, but failed in America. He speculated that Viz's decision to commission new covers by an unknown artist drawn in a \\"Dave McKean-style\\" might have been misleading when the reader opened them and saw little girls throwing hand grenades. In 2012, Thompson said that Pineapple Army was his least favorite Urasawa work available in English. While the art is good, he felt the artist had not developed his own style yet and showed too much of his Katsuhiro Otomo influence. Thompson largely compared it to Golgo 13 (which Kudo previously wrote for) with its self-contained mercenary stories, but stated that the chapters are much shorter and thus feel rushed.

It is situated 46 miles north of Mandalay on the west bank of the River Irrawaddy, and 17 miles east of Shwebo by road. It marks the end of the third defile of the Irrawaddy. Kyaukmyaung is a pottery village where the majority of the 15,000 residents who live there participate in the San Oh, or pottery, industry in some way. Kyaukmyaung is home to the only four large scale glaze factories in upper Myanmar. The largest is Nweyein.Than, Yee Yee. \\"Product Innovation Under Different Market Environment: A Case Study of Kyaukmyaung Area, Shwebo Township.\\" Universities Research Journal: 289. History Ceramic traditions in this area were first started in the Ma-u and Ohn Bin villages in the 18th century when 5,000 Mon war captives were settled in the area by King Alaungpaya (1752‚Äì1760) after his conquest of Pegu. Earlier, the Peguans from the south had rebelled and deposed the King of Ava. Aung Zeya (later Alaungpaya), chief of Moksobo (later Shwebo), led his countrymen in a revolt against the Mon, and collected a fleet at Kyaukmyaung where he defeated the advancing Mon. =Second World War= When the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company was ordered to scuttle their rivercraft at both Mandalay and Kyaukmyaung by the retreating British colonial government. The river, about half a mile wide at this point, was crossed and bridgeheads established in January 1944 by the 19th Infantry Division (India) at both Kyaukmyaung and Thabeikkyin, when the Allied forces counter-attacked. In 1960 the village decided to relocate to their current location from Ohn Bin and Ma-u to Kyaukmyaung, which is approximately 6 miles away, because of a natural deposit of clay located at Kyaukmyaung. Pottery and ceramics Martaban jars for sale at a market at Mingun on the west bank of the Irrawaddy NweNyein village Kyaukmyaung is famous for the manufacture of large glazed earthenware pots sometimes known as Kyaukmyaung pots. The majority of this village's economy stems from sending floating these pots downstream. Kyaukmyaung pots are thrown with 40 pounds of clay, and can hold 150 Vis (200 liters) of liquid. Kyaukmyaung is home to four large scale pottery \\"villages\\" or complexes - Nwenyein, Shwegon, Shwedaik, and Malar. Nwenyein is the largest of the four and employs 52% of the population. Nwynyien employs people to do everything from harvesting the clay from the riverbed to bringing in firewood for the firing process. The factory is located about 0.75 kilometers away from the bank of the stream. The complex has four very large wood kilns, two mixing stations that grind dry clay and two rooms for throwing (one for the very large San Oh pots, and the other for the smaller everyday use objects). There are two rooms for glazing, and three to five rooms for greenware. =Clay body= Block of mixed earthenware clay Two kinds of clay are used, sourced from two specific places. One clay comes from the Irrawaddy riverbed, and is a red based earthenware clay that has a high copper content. The second is a yellow clay, which is cosmic and lime based, found at a deposit 2 kilometers away. The two types of clay are mixed together with ground dried clay bricks and then refined. After this process is complete the clay may be stored for up to two years, but is also ready to be used right away. =Throwing= Small pots thrown by women at NweNyein The throwing is done in two separate rooms, depending on the type of pot that is being made. Kyaukmyaung pots are thrown on a human operated wheel submerged in the ground. Throwing these very large pots often requires two or three men. One man keeps the wheel in motion by spinning it with his hands, and the other two work on throwing. This is a very laborious process because of the sheer size of these pots. A single pot is thrown with about 40 pounds of clay. Pots are thrown in two pieces and later combined. Clay is distributed to the wheel in a stretched out logs when the wheel is in motion. This varies from the traditionally western style of throwing, where the entirety of the clay being used for the section is placed on the wheel and centered afterward. This centering process is designed so that the height of these pots is dramatically increased. It also helps to reduce air bubbles from interfering with the throwing process. The bottom section of the pot is thrown first. After a pot has been thrown it is left to dry to the leather-hard phase on the wheel. To prevent distortion in the drying process, throwers will often tie twine made from straw around the pot so it retains its circular shape. This is especially important to the stacking process. The ceramicists then throw the top portion of the pot, which they throw upside down. They measure the needed circumference with twine made from straw. When the pot is finished they remove it with string, let it dry to leather hard, and then attach it to the bottom portion of the pot. They do so through the scratch and slip method, in which they rough up the edges of the two separate pieces of the pot that they would like to stick together. Then the ceramicists apply a finer more watered down version of the clay to the scratched area and fuse them together on the wheel where the bottom part of the pot has been drying. After this is complete, they use the wheel and clean up the extra slip and visible evidence of the fusion, and confirm that the pot is fully centered. After a little more drying, they remove the pot from the wheel and place it outside to dry. The pots are still bound in string so that they retain their shape. This drying process normally takes two full days in the dry season. After two days these pots are bone dry and ready to be fired. Only men throw the Kyaukmyaung pots because they are so big that they require longer arms to reach the bottom, and that requires significant strength. The more decorative and smaller types of pottery are thrown by women. They are generally thrown off the hump or a large block of clay that is centered and then used to throw three or four ceramic objects. Smaller bowls are made for plants or decorative water jars. These wheels are also man powered wheels and are spun by one woman kicking the wheel at a constant pace, and generally one woman operates this while the other does the throwing. =Glazes= Glazes being prepared at Nweynein Traditionally the glazes that are used are mostly slipware or glazes formed from the purest and smallest particles found in the clay body. Two main glazes are applied to the pots. The first of these is a yellow glaze that is formed by adding chalk to the natural clay body. The glaze is an off-white before the firing and after turns into a warm yellow. The second glaze is made similarly, but instead of adding chalk, the villagers use burned batteries, and some compound in the batter ash turns the glaze black when fired. Women applying chalk glaze In 1973 the glaze process started changing to meet more global standards. The most aggressive change was the use of glass powder based glazes instead of slip glazes. The glass powder is still sometimes mixed with the chalk and battery plate powder, but is often mixed with lead carbonate ore, carbon oxide and cobalt oxide to achieve many of the traditional glazes. In the 1990s Nwenyein started using various paints under the glass powder glaze for some of the decorative pottery. =Firing processes= The inside of a wood kiln at NweNyein Kyaungmyauk has four functional wood kilns. They are very large and insulated by bricks. They are overseen by the firing master, one of the most senior positions at the compound. When thrown and let dry to a bone dry stage, the pots are loaded into a massive kiln. The kilns can hold up to 80 large pots and around 20 smaller pots that are often fired inside of the larger pots. They prevent the pots from sticking together by using ash. When the pots are loaded into the kiln, wood gatherers bring in wood by the truckload for this firing. The wood comes from as far away as 60 kilometers, and is generally harder wood. The firing process differs from western firing because the fire master does not know the specific temperatures that they fire pots to. Instead, they measure how long to fire these pots for based on how many truckloads of wood they have to use and the duration. Although every wood kiln firing is different, they tend to fire for two days and use four truckloads of wood. =Economic importance= Pots ready to be sold Since the 1990s, the large domestic demand for glaze wear has dramatically decreased. This is largely due to the fact that these pots last a very long time. This factor, along with the high cost of production, has caused most of the small scale factories to go out of business. Leaving behind the four factories that make up Kyaungmyauk pottery village, each of these factories follow a similar structure of being led by a single entrepreneur who oversees all of the production and coordination with wholesale vendors and stores in Yangon and father down the river. The wages vary based upon the level of skill of the workers, but skilled positions such as throwers are paid four U.S. dollars a day and wood gatherers $3 a day. All workers are allowed to take out a $500 loan from the owner every year to help them with their finances. The Kyaukmyaung pots are sold for $18‚Äì$20 directly from the factory. The majority of the pots are floated downstream on giant boats. The pots in Yangon are often sold for anywhere between $40 and $50 US. The pots are sold to different retailers in Yangon and along the Irrawaddy river. They are very popular in Myanmar as they have many uses. However, the market saw a significant decrease after 1990, because urban demand for glazed pottery decreased. In 2008 and 2009 the market saw a large boom in the wake of Cyclone Nargis.The cyclone destroyed many of the existing water storage systems, and UNICEF focused on water sources and hygiene as a response strategy.http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/myanmar_43788.html As part of this, UNICEF contracted Kyaukmyaung to make the traditional pots to serve as temporary solutions to a lack of fresh water. This triggered a revival of the economy, as an increased demand allowed Kyaumyaung to sell the pots for more profit. =Uses= Kyaukmyaung pots are traditionally used for storing and fermenting food and drink items. The most common use is the fermentation of liquor. Other uses include storing and fermenting fish paste and chili paste. The smaller bowls are often used to store drinking water, grain, and rice. Tourism Kyaukmyaung is gathering fame as a tourist destination. More tour groups are stopping here as part of cruise ships on the Irrawaddy river cruises often stop here on their tours from Bagan to Mandalay. This has brought the town much tourism from Europe and America, and led to a creation of a shop where tourists can buy the ceramics.http://www.irrawaddyprincess2.com/ Irrawaddy dolphins A 2004 survey of the Irrawaddy dolphin counted 18 to 20 between Kyaukmyaung and Mingun. In December 2005 the Department of Fisheries designated the 72 km stretch of the Irrawaddy between these two points a protected area for the dolphins.

It is a novel-length version of Lowndes' short story \\"The Lodger\\", first published in McClure's Magazine in 1911. The book tells the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting, owners of a failing lodging in London, who see in Mr. Sleuth, their only guest in a long time, their chance to salvage their business. As new murders happen in the surrounding neighborhoods, the couple becomes suspicious of this new arrival. The Lodger, considered by most critics to be Lowndes' most famous book, is the first known fictional work based on the Jack the Ripper story. The novel has been considered an example on how to write a psychological suspense due to its focus on the effects the serial killer has on the main cast of characters, instead of on the murders themselves.  Plot  = Short story = Illustration of the lodger by Henry Raleigh, 1911 The story is told from the point of view of Ellen Bunting, a former maid, and her husband and former butler, Mr. Bunting, who together are trying to manage a lodging. Struck by bad luck at their first attempt, as an epidemy develops near where their first lodging is, they decide to try one more time, with the remaining of their savings. When they are close to giving up on this endeavour, Mr. Sleuth appears and decides to stay there. He pays a month upfront and asks not to be disturbed while conducting his experiments. Mrs. Bunting becomes increasingly suspicious of Mr. Sleuth, as he arrived at the same day a gruesome murder happened, and, while staying there, several more women are killed by a mysterious man. She notices that the man only leaves after it's dark and his experiments consists of burning his clothes. Despite her growing fear, she lets Mr. Sleuth stay, as they need the money. Mr. Bunting, having received some extra money after working as a waiter for a party, invites his daughter from a previous marriage, Daisy, to come visit them for a few days during her 18th birthday. That night, while going home, he finds Mr. Sleuth on his way to the lodging. After a brief conversation, he passes Mr. Sleuth to open the lodging's front door, and accidentally touches Mr. Sleuth's pocket. The butler becomes suspicious after realizing it was drenched in blood, and even more so when two more bodies are found nearby on the next morning. At the day of Daisy's birthday, both Mr. and Mrs. Bunting leave the house at the same time. When they meet each other and realize they left Daisy alone with Mr. Sleuth, they run back and, arriving there, the girl tells them about the conversation she had with the lodger, during which he asked if he could go to Madame Tussauds with Daisy and Ellen. While in the museum, they see the Head Commissioner of Police and other officers leaving. Believing he was betrayed by Mrs. Bunting, Mr. Sleuth threatens her and disappears, only for his body to be found five days later, having drowned in a river.  Inspiration  Although The Lodger is known for being one of the first novelizations of the murderer known as Jack the Ripper, the story was also based on another murderer, Dr. Neill Cream, also known as the Lambeth Poisoner. The crimes committed by Dr. Neill Cream happened around the same time as the ones by Jack the Ripper, and the appearance of Mr. Sleuth is based on that of the Lambeth Poisoner. Edmund Pearson described Cream as \\"roaming about the dark streets of London, grotesque in his high hat and sober professional clothes, but venomous as a puff-adder.\\"  Major themes  = Gender = For literature professor Elyssa Warkentin, having the main female character being the one person capable of solving the mystery behind the murders that eluded thousands of officers and detectives, is a \\"suggestion that the problem of male violence cannot be solved within the confines of male-dominated systems of knowledge\\". According to Warkentin, the novel gives agency to women in a situation of violence and misogyny. Although Warkentin sees in the The Lodger a progressive view of women, other scholars and writers see in Lowndes' stories a more conservative view. Virginia Macdonald, in the Twentieth century crime and mystery writers chapter about Lowndes, notices a pattern in Lowndes' stories of women who are turned from respectable to murderous due to vices or other psychological problems. For Mary Jean DeMarr, the main thematic impulse of The Lodger is Mrs. Bunting's \\"willful self-deception\\". In an analysis of three of Lowndes' works, \\"focusing primarily on [...] novels about murderesses\\", Ellen Turner comments on how Mr. Sleuth, the murderer, is feminised by the author, being described as \\"a strange, queer looking figure of a man\\". For Turner, this shows that murder is strongly \\"associated with the feminine\\" in Lowndes' works. = Self-protection = When Mr. Sleuth first appears, the Buntings see in him their salvation from financial ruin. After some time, Mrs. Bunting becomes suspicious of her lodger, as she realizes he could be the one behind the murders. Even though she knows this, Mrs. Bunting avoids talking to the police, as she is afraid her association with the murderer could lead to being ostracized by society. Not only that, throughout the novel she shows a constant fear of the police, who, for the Buntings, possess an almost unnatural power. Even though Mrs. Bunting is portrayed as a \\"respectable, nineteenth century woman of her class,\\" she is free of any ethical dilemma when she chooses to protect Mr. Sleuth from the police.  Literary significance and reception  The Lodger is considered to be both the first and the best fictional adaptation of the Jack the Ripper story. According to Lowndes in one of her memoirs, the book had sold over a million copies after a few decades of its publication. When originally releasing in the United States, writers Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein helped advertise it. Edmund Pearson, a contemporary who also wrote books based on \\"true crimes\\", called Lowndes' book \\"the best novel about murder written by any living author.\\" Anthony Hilfer called it \\"[t]he classic novel of guilty bystanders\\" in his book, The Crime Novel: A Deviant Genre. Lowndes was later praised for how the story focuses not on the murderer or their targets, but instead on the people affected by them, such as the Bunting family. The Lodger, which has spawned several adaptations throughout the years, is considered today to be one of Lowndes' most widely known works. But, despite the praise she received for the novel, very few academic studies were published about it until a more recent revival. Adaptations = Cinema and television = Ivor Novello as the lodger in Hitchcock's 1926 adaptation. The first adaptation of Belloc- Lowndes novel was a silent movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock, which was also Hitchcock's first movie released to the general public. It was released in the United Kingdom in 1926 with the title The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, and in the United States in the following year titled The Case of Jonathan Drew. While the plot is very similar to the novel, due to pressure from the studio, Hitchcock changed the script to have the Buntings' daughter, Daisy, as Mr. Sleuth's love interest, as well as having the lodger, played by Ivor Novello, be revealed as not the one responsible for the killings. In 1932, another movie based on the story, also starring Novello in the main role, was released. Directed by Maurice Elvey and titled The Phantom Fiend in the United States, it was considered a closer adaptation to the original than that of Hitchcock. In 1944 another movie was released, this time by John Brahm. This version differs from the original by having the lodger's victims as actresses instead of sex workers. Hugo Fregonese directed a 1953 adaptation of The Lodger called Man in the Attic. The novel was also adapted to the television. Armchair Mystery Theatre, a companion show of Armchair Theatre, had an episode in its third season called \\"The Lodger\\", which aired in 1965 in the United Kingdom. In 1967, Wolf Dietrich directed a TV movie in Germany called Der Mieter with Pinkas Braun as the murderer. = Other media = ;Radio * 1940 episode of Suspense radio series, starring Herbert Marshall * 1944 episode of Suspense radio series, starring Robert Montgomery * 1946 episode of Hollywood Star Time radio series, starring Vincent Price * 1947 episode of Mystery in the Air radio series, starring Peter Lorre and Agnes Moorehead * 1948 episode of Suspense radio series, starring Robert Montgomery * 2003, for BBC Radio 4, adapted by Stephen Sheridan and produced by David Blount ;Opera * The Lodger (1960) by Phyllis Tate References External links * Alfred Hitchcock Collectors‚Äô Guide: The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog at Brenton Film with details and links to all adaptations 1913 British novels Novels about Jack the Ripper British novels adapted into films Novels adapted into operas Novels adapted into radio programs Novels adapted into television shows Novels by Marie Belloc Lowndes ","title":"The Lodger (novel)"},{"id":"20671638","text":"Frances Newbold Noyes Hart (August 1890 ‚Äì October 25, 1943) was an American writer whose short stories were published in Scribner's magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, the Ladies' Home Journal.

Pemphigus foliaceus causes a characteristic inflammatory attack at the subcorneal layer of epidermis, which results in skin lesions that are scaly or crusted erosions with an erythematous (red) base.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). Page 558‚Äì562. McGraw-Hill. . Mucosal involvement is absent even with widespread disease. If there is an autoimmune IgG buildup in the epidermis, then nearly all of the antibodies are aimed against desmoglein 1. The effect of the antibodies and the immunological pathway is most likely one of three mechanisms: * Steric hindrance of the desmoglein 1: The antibody caps off the site for intracellular binding to another keratinocyte. * Activation of an endocytic pathway: The antibody activates a pathway which causes an internalization of desmogle√Øn 1, which in turn causes a loss of adhesion. * Disruption of function: In this case, the antibody blocks the desmoglein 1 from being formed into a desmosome. This in turn causes a loss of adhesion with acantholysis as a result. Cause The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases describes it like this: Normally, our immune system produces antibodies that attack viruses and harmful bacteria to keep us healthy. In people with pemphigus, however, the immune system mistakenly attacks the cells in the epidermis, or top layer of the skin, and the mucous membranes. The immune system produces antibodies against proteins in the skin known as desmogleins. These proteins form the glue that keeps skin cells attached and the skin intact. When desmogleins are attacked, skin cells separate from each other and fluid can collect between the layers of skin, forming blisters that do not heal. In some cases, these blisters can cover a large area of skin. Diagnosis Pemphigus foliaceus is diagnosed base on history, biopsy of the affected skin, and testing either a blood sample or a skin sample for the antibodies that cause pemphigus. Treatment Epidemiology Pemphigus is endemic in the rural areas of Brazil, especially along inland riverbeds.

The wars were a successful uprising of cooperative groups, such as the farmers of Appenzell or the craftsmen of the city of St. Gallen, against the traditional medieval power structure represented by the House of Habsburg and the Prince-Abbot of the Abbey of St. Gall. Background A Landsgemeinde in Appenzell, 2005. The direct representation of the Landsgemeinde conflicted with the autocratic government of the Abbey and the Habsburgs Appenzell (the name in means \\"cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot\\") had been under the personal control of the abbot of St. Gall. While the Prince-Abbot appointed agents or bailiffs, the communities in Appenzell were governed by a council appointed by the Landsgemeinde, in which every citizen could vote. The success of the Swiss Confederation, with similar Landsgemeinden, against the aristocratic Habsburgs encouraged the Appenzell citizens to consider throwing off the Abbot's agents. By about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both parties. Both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom. Outbreak of the war Following increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers and the abbot's agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man's clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a certain day, throughout the abbot's lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty. The treaty between St. Gallen and Appenzell marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen's support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the Canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the last century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen before heading toward Appenzell. In May 1403, the abbot's and the League's troops marched toward Trogen. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass to Speicher and outside the village of V√∂gelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of about 80 Appenzellers started the attack from a hill over the valley, with about 300 soldiers from Schwyz and 200 from Glarus moving around the flanks of the army. When the League's cavalry charged up the hill, they met 2000 Appenzellers and were forced to retreat. During the retreat, about 600 horsemen and many of the 5000 infantry were killed by the Appenzell army. The League signed a peace treaty with Appenzell at Arbon, but the peace was short lived. Independence for Appenzell A memorial on the site of the Battle of Stoss Pass in 1405 Along with independence, in the peace treaty Appenzell gained some of the abbot's land in the Rhine valley and around Lake Constance, which angered the abbot. Additionally, over the next two years, the city of St. Gallen and Appenzell drew closer. By 1405 the abbot had found another ally and was ready to retake his land. Frederick IV, Duke of Austria, provided the abbot with two Austrian armies to attack Appenzell. On 17 June 1405, the main army marched into Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell and there met the Appenzell army. Following a brutal battle, the Austrian army was forced to retreat. The story that the Austrians retreated when they saw a second Appenzeller army, which was actually the women of Appenzell who had come to help their husbands and brothers, only appears in later sources and is not considered accurate. Following the Appenzell victory at Stoss Pass, they formed an alliance with the city of St. Gallen, which was known as the ' (\\"alliance over the sea\\", referring to the nearby Lake Constance). The creation of the ' shook the foundation of Austrian power in the Lake Constance region. By 1406 they had taken more than 60 castles and destroyed 30. During the expansion, Appenzell had even captured the abbot of St Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance. However, while the ' expanded the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On September 11, 1406, an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the ' (\\"Order of St. George's Shield\\") to oppose the rebellious commoners of the '. The order besieged the ' city of in 1407. On January 13, 1408, ' troops marched against the Order and Austrian troops outside the city. The attack was a disaster for the ', when their troops were defeated and driven back from the walls. Following the defeat Appenzell was unable to hold the ' together. The city of St. Gallen and the canton of each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the ' was dissolved by King Rupert on April 4, 1408. As part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owned certain taxes. However, it wasn't until 1410 that the area was at peace. In 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an \\"Associate Member\\", and wouldn't become a full member until 1513. In the following years, Appenzell refused to pay the taxes that they owed the abbot. In 1421 the Confederation supported the abbot against Appenzell over the matter of these taxes, and an imperial ban was declared to try to force them to pay. When this was unsuccessful, in 1426 they were placed under an interdict and an army was sent into Appenzell to force them to pay. Frederick VII, Count of Toggenburg, supported by the Order of St. George's Shield marched into Appenzell. On 2 December 1428 they encountered and defeated the Appenzell army behind a heavy fortification (known as a Letzi) on the field between Gossau and Herisau. Following the battle, in 1429 Appenzell was forced to repay the owed taxes but was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell's last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement to closer relationships with the Confederation.

It provides a framework for describing open system concepts and defining a lexicon of terms, that can be agreed upon generally by all interested parties. This reference model is meant as environment model, complementary to the POSIX architecture for open systems. It offers an extensible framework that allows services, interfaces, protocols, and supporting data formats to be defined in terms of nonproprietary specifications that evolve through open (public), consensus-based forums.ACM Sigsoft (1993) 15th International Conference on Software Engineering, May 17-21, 1993. p.349 This reference model served in the 1990s as basic building block of several technical reference models and technical architecture. In 1996 this reference model was standardized in the ISO/IEC TR 14252 titled \\"Information technology -- Guide to the POSIX Open System Environment (OSE)\\".Wolfgang Kresse, Kian Fadaie (2004) ISO Standards for Geographic Information. p.72  History  The development of the open-system environment reference model started early 1990s by the NIST as refinement of the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard. POSIX is a standard for maintaining compatibility between operating systems, and addresses interoperation for communications, computing, and entertainment infrastructure. Its development started late 1980s by the POSIX Working Group 1003.0 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The NIST hosted workshops and conducts other support activities to assist users in addressing open systems requirements, preparing for the use of new technology, and identifying the international, national, industry and other open specifications that are available for building open systems frameworks, such as the government's applications portability profile for the open-system environment. NIST sponsors the semiannual Users' Forum on Application Portability Profile (APP) and Open System Environment (OSE) to exchange information and respond to NIST proposals regarding the evaluation and adoption of an integrated set of standards to support the APP and OSE. The quarterly Open Systems Environment Implementors' Workshop (OIW), co-sponsored by NIST and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society, provides a public international technical forum for the timely development of implementation agreements based on emerging OSE standards.STANDARDS FOR OPEN SYSTEMS: MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR FEDERAL USERS NIST Bulletin 1996. Accessed 13 Dec 2008.  OSE/RM topics  The open-system environment (OSE) forms an extensible framework that allows services, interfaces, protocols, and supporting data formats to be defined in terms of nonproprietary specifications that evolve through open (public), consensus- based forums. A selected suite of specifications that defines these interfaces, services, protocols, and data formats for a particular class or domain of applications is called a profile. Two types of elements are used in the model: entities consisting of the application software, application platform, and platform external environment; and interfaces including the application program interface and external environment interface. = APP service areas = APP Service Areas and the OSE-RM The Application Portability Profile (APP) is an OSE profile designed for use by the U.S. Government. It covers a broad range of application software domains of interest to many Federal agencies, but it does not include every domain within the U.S. Government‚Äôs application inventory. The individual standards and specifications in the APP define data formats, interfaces, protocols, or a mix of these elements. The services defined in the APP tend to fall into broad service areas. These service areas are: * Operating system services (OS) * Human/computer interface services (HCI) * Data management services (DM) * Data interchange services (DI) * Software engineering services (SWE) * Graphics services (GS) * Network services (NS) Each service area is defined in the following sections. The figure illustrates where each of these services areas relates to the OSE/RM. Assume that software engineering services are applicable in all areas. Each of the APP service areas addresses specific components around which interface, data format, or protocol specifications have been or will be defined. Security and management services are common to all of the service areas and pervade these areas in one or more forms. = Classes of interfaces = There are two classes of interfaces in the OSE reference model: the application program interface and the external environment interface: * Application programming interface (API) : The API is the interface between the application software and the application platform. Its primary function is to support portability of application software. An API is categorized in accordance with the types of service accessible via that API. There are four types of API services in the OSE/RM: ** Human/computer interface services ** Information interchange services ** Communication services ** Internal system services * External environment interface (EEI) : The EEI is the interface that supports information transfer between the application platform and the external environment, and between applications executing on the same platform. Consisting chiefly of protocols and supporting data formats, the EEI supports interoperability to a large extent. An EEI is categorized in accordance with the type of information transfer services provided. = OSE profile = A profile consists of a selected list of standards and other specifications that define a complement of services made available to applications in a specific domain. Examples of domains might include a workstation environment, an embedded process control environment, a distributed environment, a transaction processing environment, or an office automation environment, to name a few. Each of these environments has a different cross-section of service requirements that can be specified independently from the others. Each service, however, is defined in a standard form across all environments. An OSE profile is composed of a selected list of open (public), consensus-based standards and specifications that define services in the OSE/RM. Restricting a profile to a specific domain or group of domains that are of interest to an individual organization results in the definition of an organizational profile. = OSE reference model entities = The three classes of OSE reference model entities are described as follows: * Application software : Within the context of the OSE Reference Model, the application software includes data, documentation, and training, as well as programs. * Application platform : The application platform is composed of the collection of hardware and software components that provide the generic application and system services. * Platform external environment : The platform external environment consists of those system elements that are external to the application software and the application platform (e.g., services provided by other platforms or peripheral devices). = Types of information transfer services = There are three types of information transfer services. These are transfer services to and from: * Human users * External data stores * Other application platforms In its simplest form, the OSE/RM illustrates a straightforward user-supplier relationship: the application software is the user of services and the application platform/ external environment entities are the suppliers. The API and EEI define the services that are provided.  Applications  Detailed DoD technical reference model of the TAFIM, is based on the Open System Environment model. Department of Defense (1996). Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management. Vol. 2. April 1996 Basically, the open-system environment model is a basic building block of several technical reference models and technical architecture. A technical architecture identifies and describes the types of applications, platforms, and external entities; their interfaces; and their services; as well as the context within which the entities interoperate. A technical architecture is based on: * a Technical Reference Model (TRM); and * the selected standards that further describe the TRM elements (the profile). The technical architecture is the basis for selecting and implementing the infrastructure to establish the target architecture.Consolidated Definitions and References at acf.hhs.gov. Accessed 12 Dec 2008. A technical reference model can be defined as a taxonomy of services arranged according to a conceptual model, such as the Open System Environment model. The enumerated services are specific to those needed to support the technology computing style (e.g., distributed object computing) and the industry/business application needs (e.g., Human Services, financial).

The Iglesia de El Salvador is a church in Toledo, Spain completed in 1159. Although the church is small, it is an exceptional building, because it was the site of 4 successive constructions, one on other and so on. It's a 12th- century church built on an 11th-century Taifa mosque, which was an expansion of a 9th-century Umayyad mosque and in turn on a Visigothic religious building. Also these civilizations reused 2nd-century Roman elements. Have to say that is very-usually at the al-Andalus territory that Muslim liked to build on Visigothic buildings. The large number of Visigothic decorative reliefs forming friezes and Roman cornices embedded in the walls is surprising. The current church is still oriented south-east, in the direction of Mecca. It survived the conquest of Toledo by the Christian armies in 1085, to be turned into a church in 1159. One of the most characteristic elements of the church is a Visigothic pilaster, with intricate relief carvings.Roger Collins, Spain, An Oxford Archaeological Guide, ed. Oxford University Press, 1998 , p. 277 As a Christian church, from around 1180 to the late-15th century, it began to be used as a cemetery with anthropomorphic tombs, above which were placed more burials, in which some grave goods have been found.  History  A Visighotic relief The Iglesia de El Salvador is located in the city of Toledo, near the Churches of Santo Tom√© and Convento de Santa √örsula. It is one of the churches mentioned in the Lazarillo de Tormes, and here Joanna of Castile (\\"the Mad\\") and the dramatist Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla were baptized. The first (Umayyad) mosque can be considered the oldest in the city because of the brickwork and the remains, and the second in importance. There are some data that place this building as one of the main mosques in the city. It was rebuilt during the Taifa period (11th century) until its conversion to Christian worship in 1145. There is a Mozarabic tombstone of 1041, which attest to a renovation or expansion of the building. Some historians have suggested that when Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile took Toledo at 1085 allowed the Muslim population to continue using it as the main mosque of the city. In the twelfth century and at the request of his wife, Alfonso VII converted the mosque into a Christian church with the invocation of the Savior and, in fact, the Christian church appears since 1180 in Mozarabic documents. The current church is built on the mosque, so it is oriented southeast in direction toward Mecca. For which construction, different elements of the previous Visigothic building were reused, because of that a horseshoe arcade supported on Visigothic pilasters has been preserved with sculpted decoration of figurative themes, unusual in this type of remains. The Pilaster of El Salvador, shows in one of its faces various Visigothic miraculous scenes from the life of Jesus: the Cure of the Blind, the Resurrection of Lazarus, the Samaritan and the Hemorro√≠sa, as well as other themes of eucharistic hue that alluding to Christ as the salvation. Its crude treatment shows the abandonment in which the work had fallen on the stone. As a means of legitimizing the building, both the interior and the surroundings, it began to be used as a funerary space from then until the 15th century; also there are other two tombs from the 19th century. There are numerous remains of medieval tombs, embedded in architectures in the way of a pantheon. Although it conserves the shape of the minaret, that carries incrustations of borders, in 1159 it made several Christian modifications, and the construction in the end-15th century of the Gothic chapel of Santa Catalina. The tower corresponds to the minaret of the mosque, with a Baroque brick addition at the body of the bells. It is dedicated to St. Savior. The church suffered a fire in the 15th- century, which forced an important restoration. √Ålvarez de Toledo was commissioned to the restoration and he adds new chapels highlighting the chapel of Santa Catalina. In the Main Chapel there is a small altarpiece of the mid-16th century, made by Nicol√°s de Vergara the Elder and Bautista V√°zquez. In the nineteenth century the Napoleonic troops stole the silver lamps that lit the temple, and other valuable pieces. The parish was suppressed in 1842, giving its liturgical objects to the ecclesiastical vicarage and to other parishes and convents of Toledo and the towns. Description and remains In the remains under the church was found this arcade of the first mosque, composed of three columns with Roman and Visigothic capitals Remains of a Christian medieval cemetery The Visigothic pilaster, for some early Christian, is one of the oldest pieces in which are represented 4 scenes of the life of Christ, who despite the scraping of the faces by the Muslims, could be distinguished: Blind, Resurrection of Lazarus, Christ and the Samaritan woman in the well and Hemorro√≠sa Healing. The level of excavation has not gone deep into the Visigoth or Roman substrate. However, already surprised the great amount of Visigothic reliefs forming friezes and Roman cornices embedded in the walls. In 2004 the Consorcio group discovered the remains of the first (Umayyad) Mosque buried several meters under the church, the archaeologists have recovered and valued. The remains of the Umayyad arcade of horseshoe arches with a limestone in the keystone, characteristic of Caliphate art, next to the minaret whose brickwork resembles the first minaret of the Mosque of C√≥rdoba, show a dating to the first half of the 9th century. Later, as an inscription in the Chapel of Santa Catalina attests, in the 11th century, during the Taifa period a nave was built, it is believed that it was an extension of the space because it had become a main mosque. In 1950 this arcade of horseshoe arches that support on 6 reused Roman capitals and a Visigothic pilaster, was reconstructed on the original arches of the ends. In the 2000s the recovery of the tower's original wall, they removed the covering of a medieval and baroque reforms, it was discovered the original floor of the primitive 9th-century mosque, with its surrounding area containing a courtyard with cistern and its doors, as well as the verification in foundations and walls of the extension documented in the 11th century and consisting of addition of a whole nave whose base is in the current arches of horseshoe arches. In the courtyard, located at the head of the apse, is an arcade, composed of three columns with Roman and Visigoth capitals, which support four horseshoe arches, brick, framed by alfices and topped by a cornice of corbels, similar to the mosque of Cristo de la Luz. On the ground, on the late-Roman stratum, there two structures: a ma·∏°[a]rah and a closing wall from the 9th-10th centuries, similar to a musalla, or element to delimit a sacred space, or an area of respect around the mosque.

The novel is set in Chalatenango, El Salvador and follows the daily life of Guadalupe Guardado and the women of her family just prior to the Salvadoran Civil War. The book was banned by the government of El Salvador after its 1980 release for its descriptions of human rights violations by the Organizaci√≥n Democr√°tica Nacionalista, the government's paramilitary intelligence organization. Argueta spent over 20 years exiled in Costa Rica following arrests for his involvement in political activity against the government. One Day of Life was published in 1980, the year of the beginning of the Salvadoran Civil War. One Day of Life was nominated by Modern Library as the fifth-best Latin American book of the 20th century. The Salvadoran newspaper El Diario de Hoy expressed doubt in the nomination. Other critics expressed disapproval of Argueta's novel being selected higher than popular writers like Ernesto Sabato and Alejo Carpentier. Plot summary Guadalupe \\"Lupe\\" Guardado is a middle- aged Salvadoran woman who lives near Chalatenango, El Salvador. During the day she is required to do what she can to support her family, while her husband works for a wealthy landowner. Her husband Jos√© has become involved in rebellion against the economic conditions and became a leader in the Christian farmers organization. Fearing persecution for his opposition, Jos√© regularly stays \\"in the hills\\" after work and sees his family little. The Guardado's son Justino was killed by the \\"authorities\\" prior to the events in the novel, and their son-in-law Helio has \\"disappeared.\\" Guadalupe's granddaughter Adolfina relays the protest at a cathedral, as well as a massacre of students on a bus. At the end of the novel, the authorities bring a beaten man to Guadalupe and Adolfina who had said the name \\"Adolfina\\" after being severely beaten. Adolfina does not recognize the man, but Guadalupe recognizes her husband Jos√©. On his previous advice, she denies knowing him, and he is taken away.

Saint Leo of Catania, nicknamed the Thaumaturgus, also known as St Leo the Wonderworker in Sicily (May 703 or 709 ‚Äì 20 February 789), was the fifteenth bishop of Catania, famed also for his love and care toward the poor.

Retrieved: 2013-06-24. the day of his death in which he is venerated as a saint both by Roman Catholics and by the Orthodox Church. He lived in the lapse of time between the reigns of the Emperors Justinian II and Constantine IV. He struggled especially against the paganism and sorcery still prevalent in the Byzantine Sicily. He left the memory of prodigies and charitable deeds, an admirable apostolate that deserved him his Greek epithet. For the natives of Catania he was simply Leone \\" il Maraviglioso\\" (the Wonderworker or He who performs Miracles). Catania dedicated to him a peripheral suburb built around the homonymous Catholic Parish but even the name of the sole Eastern Orthodox church of the city, harboured in a temple that still maintains the primal name of Saint Michael the Lesser, restored recently and consecrated again to the purpose. He is, moreover, the patron saint of the Sicilian localities of Rometta, Longi and Sinagra. The hamlet of Saracena in Calabria celebrates him twice a year in spring and in late summer. Life Leo was born at Ravenna (then under the suzerainty of the Eastern Roman Empire) and at a very young age he became a Benedictine, he then moved to Reggio Calabria in Southern Italy where the local bishop Cyril nominated him to be an archdeacon. He stayed there until his episcopal election for the vacant Diocese of Catania. A local legend asserts that the Catanians, who needed a new Bishop, had a collective dream wherein an Angel suggested them to search for the selected person in the Calabrian city of Reggio where a man in odour of sanctity lived in an hermitage. That stranger would have become the right guide to fill suchlike post. At first Leo was reluctant as he considered himself not worthy for this ordeal so he did not accept and decided to refute politely such summary acclaim. Afterwards, when the umpteen solicitations from Catania became doubtless and heartfelt, he persuaded at last. In fact on 765 he was appointed to rule over that Community of Christians. In the coming epoch, in every regions of the Byzantine Empire (of whom Catania with the entire Sicily was a dominion) began the fierce and unrestrainable destruction of the sacred icons, the so-called \\"iconoclasm\\", which Leo openly opposed to. Owing to his firmness, the Byzantine Governor of Sicily ordered his arrest, forcing him to leave Catania and find refuge on the Tyrrhenian territories of the island. He wandered for many years through the woody Nebrodian heights, in the whereabouts between Longi and Sinagra, protected by the people that recognized him as a fervent opposer of the Imperial power. He reached, during this long peregrination a place called Rometta. Here, on the Monti Peloritani backing Messina, he lived in a cave he hollowed out all by himself with his very hands and fingernails. Shortly after, when his persecution seemed to calm down he was able to come back to Catania where he repossessed his bishopric to keep on fighting with more strength than ever against the iconoclast laws and the new and growing gurgles of heresy. He died in Catania on 20 February 789. A Catanian legend: the Thaumaturge and the Charmer According to a local account, among the candidates who were excluded from being vested with the episcopate, there was a character called Heliodorus. Catanian dignitary of noble birth, he probably denied his Christian belief because of envy and rage for a choice so sudden and unexplainable to him, bearing a malice towards the foreign-born nominee and his fellow-citizens. For this reason, he began devoting himself to the occult and magic with the sole aim to grow into Leo's worst adversary and noisome disturber to fascinate and lead astray with any sort of wizardries his occasional spectators in order to acquire easily compliant followers. On the other hand, Leo always tried peacefully to convince Heliodorus that his behavior and deviltries were thoroughly wrong. But in vain. They met each other for the last time on 778 AD and their final clash will have a large echo throughout Sicily, to rebound even to the Imperial court of Constantinople. During a Mass officiated by the Saint Prelate in the whilom mother-church of Catania, Heliodorus noisily rushed into the nave, slinking away along the pews to spellbind and confound the believers engrossed in the Sunday rite. In further versions of the same tale, many story-tellers want him to clamour inside the temple in the likeness of a black elephant or with the retinue of a trumpeting pachyderm. Leo was constrained to conclude the Liturgy and determined on ending those roaring witcheries he drew away from the altar and forced his way through the parishioners to face that \\"demonic jester\\". Deranged by sorrow, he drew the conclusion that all his mild approaches and patient argumentations would have not been efficient any more. So, he decided to dare that impious enchanter to show publicly and prove baldly he who professed the rightest creed. After ordering to heap up wood for a pyre in a furnace inside the close Achillean Thermal Baths, Leo suddenly enwrapped his Omophorion round the abashed miscreant dragging him towards the chosen place where the balefire was already crackling. Both were immediately enfolded by highest flames that transformed their lineations and clothes in embers. Only Leo will survive to this test of faith. He came out of the stake with undamaged vestments that kept shining about his unscathed body. The other unwilling contestant was fated to succumb instead. The only traces of his funeral pile were, as a matter of fact, a mass of smoking and glittering ashes. References =Sources= * Santi Correnti. La citt√† semprerifiorente. Catania, Greco, 1977.

This species is characterized by its whitish- pink color (no dark pigment), long tubular snout, long dorsal appendage, and tiny, bilaterally asymmetrical eyes. Systematics O. tamandua was originally described as Sternarchus tamandua by George Albert Boulenger in 1880; its species name is from the Tupi word tamandu√°, meaning \\"anteater\\", in reference to its long snout. In 1905, Eigenmann and Ward placed this species in the genus Sternarchorhamphus, though noting that it may represent a distinct genus. In 1913, Max M. Ellis placed this species into its own genus Orthosternarchus, from the Greek orthos (\\"straight\\"), sternon (\\"chest\\"), and archos (\\"rectum\\"), referring to the straight snout and the forward placement of the urogenital opening. Ellis saw O. tamandua as a close relative to Sternarchorhamphus, which has been corroborated by recent morphological and molecular analyses. The relationship between these two genera and the rest of the Apteronotidae is less clear, though they are generally regarded as basal within the family. Some authors consider them to be sister taxa to Platyurosternarchus and Sternarchorhynchus, which also have elongate heads. However, in those taxa the elongation is accomplished by lengthening of the jaws, whereas in Orthosternarchus and Sternarchorhamphus it is accomplished by the lengthening of the head while the jaws remain relatively short. This suggests that elongate head shape was independently evolved between the two groups. Distribution and habitat O. tamandua is a relatively rarely recorded species found in the Amazon River basin, and is most abundant in the Rio Negro and the Rio Purus. It inhabits both whitewater and blackwater rivers, usually occurring at depths of and occasionally shallower or deeper, but has not yet been recorded beyond down. It is absent from floodplain channels, river edges, and small lakes. A few specimens are known from the confluence of the Rio Solim√µes and the Rio Negro, and from Lake Prato, Anavilhanas. Description One of the gymnotiforms most specialized to living in deep river channels, O. tamandua resembles fishes adapted to caves in several respects. Their elongated, laterally compressed bodies are nearly unpigmented, appearing bright pink due to the blood underneath. The eyes are tiny and virtually non-functional, and are placed asymmetrically on the head. The asymmetry of the eyes is not correlated with size, sex or environment, but may be related to their degenerate state. The snout is distinctive, being a long, evenly tapering, nearly straight tube measuring four times as long as high. The mouth is relatively small. The dorsal throng (a whip-like appendage used for electroreception) is unusually long and thick, which led it to originally be described as a \\"very strongly developed adipose fin\\" by Boulenger. The throng originates close to the rear margin of the skull, which is much more anterior than in other apteronotids. O. tamandua has a long anal fin, a small caudal fin, and tapering pectoral fins; the dorsal and pelvic fins are absent. The caudal fin shows a great deal of variation due to regeneration after tail loss; in some cases the regenerated fin becomes merged with the anal fin. The fin rays number 9 in the caudal fin, 14-15 in the pectoral fins, and 207-256 in the anal fin. Almost the entire body, except for the dorsal midline, is densely covered with flimsily attached scales, being small and circular towards the front and larger and more rectangular towards the back. There are around 12 rows of scales above the lateral line and 40-42 rows below. The first 5-10 scales along the lateral line are modified into overlapping elongate tubes. The maximum known size is long and . Biology and ecology As in other apteronotids, O. tamandua generates a continuous weak electric field for electrolocation and communication. At 452-605 Hz, the electric organ discharge (EOD) of O. tamandua has a much lower frequency than most other apteronotids and approaches the frequencies of the sternopygid knifefishes. The EOD is also unusual in that the waveform is monophasic, with a head-negative spike followed by a positive baseline (the EOD of most apteronotids have both positive and negative spikes). The only other apteronotid known to have a monophasic EOD is the related Sternarchorhamphus muelleri. The monophasic waveform of these two genera is similar to the EOD of a larval Apteronotus, suggesting that it may be a paedomorphic or evolutionarily ancestral trait.

The Creek is also known as The Ponds and the Subiaco Creek respectively. It is followed by a walking track known as 'The Ponds Walk'. The Ponds Walk The Ponds Walk and Galaringi Reserve from Carlingford Bowling Club The Ponds Walk is a 7.7-kilometre walking track which follows The Ponds Creek from Eric Mobbs Memorial Park to Jim Crowgey Reserve lining the Subiaco Creek. The track passes through Carlingford, Dundas Valley, Telopea, Dundas, Ermington and Rydalmere. Leashed dogs are permitted on the walk. Subiaco Creek leg of The Ponds Walk Ecology The Ponds Creek is a tributary of Subiaco Creek, having its source in Carlingford and flowing through Dundas Valley. Flora and Fauna blossom in the Ponds, including Sydney exclusive species of birds and trees. It is also the home of turtles, ducks, rabbits and snakes. It has been deduced that the vegetation of the Ponds Subiaco Creek is Blue Gum High Forest and Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest, meaning protection and plan of action is required to maintain this rarity. It has been classified as critically endangered under the New South Wales government's Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. An additional source of Subiaco Creek is in the suburb of Ermington. The creek then flows westwards though Rydalmere before turning south for a short distance and draining into the Parramatta River. It is approximately long. Mushrooms growing along The Ponds Walk Bird life include the White-faced Heron, Wood Duck, Pacific Black Duck, Australian White Ibis, Laughing Kookaburra, Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo, Galah, Magpie, Noisy Mynah, Raven Rainbow Lorikeet and King Parrot. History The Ponds was the name given to a chain of freshwater ponds which formed the headwaters of the Ponds Creek. They were described in 1789 by Lieutenant-General Watkin Tench, who wrote \\"the Ponds, a name which I suppose it derived from several ponds of water\\". Autumn in The Ponds Walk Subiaco Creek flows through one of the earliest areas settled by European colonists in Australia. It was site of the fourth land grant in the colony of New South Wales which was made to Phillip Schaeffer. As a consequence, the creek was known as Schaffers Creek. Schaeffer created a property called 'The Vineyard'. This name is commemorated by Vineyard Creek to the west of Subiaco Creek. After a succession of owners the property was purchased by Hannibal Macarthur in 1813. Macarthur built a mansion called 'The Vineyard' on the land in 1836. This mansion later became a Benedictine convent and boarding school for girls. The nuns named the school 'Subiaco', after the Italian town of Subiaco in which Saint Benedict established his religious order. Geography Much of the length of Subiaco Creek has been contained within a network of reserves and parks. The art historian Bernard Smith recounts memories of picking \\"great bunches of wildflowers\\" along Subiaco Creek in his youth. Some sections of the creek near Cowells Lane Reserve have been placed in culverts and covered over.

He was formerly a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York from 2007 to 2018.  Background and education  Sullivan was born in Manhasset, New York. He graduated from Chaminade High School in 1982 and earned a Bachelor of Arts in government and English at the College of William & Mary in 1986. He received a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1990.  Legal career  After law school, Sullivan worked as a law clerk to Judge David M. Ebel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and as a litigation associate at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. From 1994 to 2005, Sullivan served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he successfully prosecuted the Maisonet heroin organization, which sold approximately $100,000 worth of heroin per day in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx and carried out numerous murders in aid of its racketeering activity. Among those prosecuted in that case was Bronx defense attorney Pat Stiso, who acted as house counsel to the RICO enterprise. Other notable cases included the investigation and indictment of Mario Villanueva Madrid, who as governor of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo accepted millions of dollars from Mexican drug cartels in exchange for providing safe passage for ton quantities of cocaine en route to the United States. Madrid was eventually extradited to the United States, where he pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy. In 2002, Sullivan became chief of the newly created International Narcotics Trafficking Unit (INT), which was responsible for investigating and prosecuting the world's largest and most powerful narcotics organizations. Among the noteworthy defendants prosecuted by that unit were Colombia kingpins Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, Diego Murillo Bejarano, and Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela; Afghan warlord Bashir Noorzai; Dutch ecstasy kingpin Henk Rommy; and the leadership of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Sullivan was named Prosecutor of the Year by the Federal Law Enforcement Association in 1998 and was awarded the Henry L. Stimson Medal from the New York City Bar Association in 2003. In 2005, Sullivan joined Marsh, Inc., a global risk and insurances firm, as deputy general counsel for litigation. He was named general counsel of Marsh in June 2006.

The breed was developed during the years from 1944 to 1982 in the Gorno-Altai Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic region of the Soviet Union, by cross- breeding the Don goat with local goats for a high wool yield.  Appearance  Females (nanny goats) weigh 41 to 44kg (90 to 97lb) while males (billy goats) weigh 65 to 70kg (143 to 155lb). Altai Mountain goats are black in color at a young age, and change to dark brown or grey as they mature. A distinctive feature of the Altai Mountain goat is the length and volume of the wool they grow, which is three to four times more than the local goats of the region.  Origin  The breed was first introduced in the Altai Republic region of the Altai Mountains. The breed was slowly developed between 1944 and 1982 by cross-breeding the Don goat with goats local to the region. The goal of developing the breed was to create a goat with a high wool production that could withstand the severe weather conditions of the harsh winters in Siberia.  Reproduction and care  The Altai Mountain goat was originally bred to increase the amount of wool available per goat. During the project's peak, the population grew almost 30 percent in a year. They are currently bred to increase the population. Due to their selective breeding for climate tolerance, Altai Mountain goats can be kept on pasture year-round.  South African project  In 1997, approximately 500 Altai Mountain goats were released in South Africa by Sentrachem, a South African agricultural chemical company. As a result, owning goat flocks became more profitable by producing a breed that had a high yield of both meat and cashmere. This helped spur agricultural production in South Africa and bolster the fiber and Cashmere wool industry. When cross-bred with the indigenous goats, the goats are expected to have a higher meat and cashmere yield (around 600g of brown cashmere), increasing profitability of goat herds.

It is hypothesized that antigens associated with the tumor trigger an immune response resulting in blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. While patients with malignant and benign tumors are both at risk, malignancy is associated with high mortality rates (near 90%). Current treatment focuses on general wound healing and administering corticosteroids, which has not demonstrated a high success rate. Recent research developments aim to treat the underlying tumor in order to alleviate the symptoms of PNP. Signs and symptoms While the presence of lesions is the denominator among patients with PNP, the characteristics of the lesions differ. The five clinical presentations of lesions associated with PNP include: * \\"Pemphigus- like\\": Flaccid blister (discrete), crusts over the raw exuding skin lesions * \\"Pemphigoid-like\\": Tense blister(s) on brick red erythema * \\"Erythema multiforme-like\\": Severe polymorphic skin and/or mucous membrane lesions * \\"Graft-vs.-host disease-like\\": Widespread lichenoid eruption with severe mucous membrane involvement * \\"Lichen planus-like\\": Small red flat-topped scaly papules It is most common that mucous membrane lesions of the oral cavity are presented first. They can involve the oropharynx, nasopharynx, tongue, and vermilion (red portion) of the lips. They are also known to develop in the conjunctiva of the eye, anogenital (perineum) region, and esophagus. Cutaneous lesions tend to follow the onset of mucosal lesions. The blisters often erupt in waves, usually affecting the upper trunk, head, neck, and proximal extremities. Pemphigoid-like lesions are seen more often on the extremities. Lichenoid lesions are more common among children, presenting on the trunk and limbs, ranging from small red scaly papules to extensive violet to brown papules extending to the face and neck. Within the spectrum of lichenoid presentations are wounds that have features of erythema multiforme and graft-vs.-host disease. Scaly lesions on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet have been noted to coincide with the lichenoid lesions. Lesions of varying morphology may present simultaneously and transform from one type to another as the disease progresses. Mechanism =Underlying cause= PNP is ultimately caused by the presence of a tumor. There is a strong association between the development of PNP and malignancy of the tumor. However, it is not uncommon for the tumor to be benign, as in the case of afflictions such as thymoma and Castleman's disease. Only one patient without a tumor has met the diagnostic criteria for PNP. However, they rapidly reached their demise and it is suggested they may have had an undiagnosed tumor. =Mechanism behind display of major symptoms= The underlying tumor causes circulating and tissue-bound antibodies to direct themselves against antigens in the plakin family, which are involved in the intracellular attachment structures in various levels of the skin/respiratory tract/membranes (keeping skin tissue together throughout the body). The number of target antigens varies on a case by case basis. The variability is likely what accounts for the different presentations of PNP. Through immunoprecipitation, target antigens have been found to include desmoglein-3, desmoglein-1, envoplakin, periplakin, desmoplakin 1, desmoplakin 2, and bullous pemphigoid antigen I. The precise mechanism for how tumors are able to induce autoantibodies toward the plakin proteins is unknown. Suggested theories include tumor production of plakin proteins which initiate an autoimmune response against them, and cross- reactivity of tumor antigens and epidermal antigens. Once the molecules that hold the various levels of the membranes together are attacked, they are unable to function properly, and the tissue breaks apart. This is manifested as the associated blistering and lesions of PNP. Diagnosis In order to diagnose paraneoplastic pemphigus, several tests may be performed. Initially, samples are obtained via skin biopsy for routine microscopy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing. The skin sample needs to be obtained from an unaffected area adjacent to a lesion. Testing in more detail follows depending on the results from the DIF. Prompt diagnosis of PNP is crucial due to the high mortality rate of the disease. Camisa and Helm revised the original criteria from Anhalt et al. into major and minor signs indicating PNP: Major: *Polymorphic mucocutaneous eruption *Concurrent internal tumor *Serum antibodies with a specific immunoprecipitation pattern Minor: *Histologic evidence of acantholysis (loss of intercellular connections leading to breaking apart of the skin; lesion) *Direct immunofluorescence showing intercellular and basement membrane staining *Indirect immunofluorescence staining with rat bladder epithelium =Microscopy= Microscopy of the skin sample obtained from the biopsy is used to detect the presence of cleavage within the dermis, epidermal acantholysis (breaking apart of the skin), dyskeratotic keratinocytes and vacuolar changes in the layers of the skin, interfacial dermatitis, and epidermal exocytosis. Presentation of these characteristics suggests PNP. =Direct immunofluorescence testing= The presence of Immunoglobulin G, A, or M in the epidermis is normal. Detection in other locations such as intercellular and areas below the epidermis (subepidermal), as well as along the dermoepidermal junction (area that joins the epidermis and dermis), suggests paraneoplastic pemphigus. =Follow-up tests for confirmation= Indirect immunofluorescence (IDIF) Patients with high concentration of antibodies show intercellular, intraepidermal antibodies as well as along the dermoepidermal junction. Patients with low concentration of antibodies only present with them inside the cells (intercellular). If the results are negative, perform the additional assays regardless. Cases have been confirmed that reported with initial negative DIF and IDIF tests. Assays Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and enzyme- link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Poot et al. 2013 determined that immunoprecipitation for antibodies against envoplakin and periplakin or alpha2-macroglobulin-like‚Äì1 is the most sensitive test. However, alpha2-macroglobulin-like-1 can also be detected in patients with toxic epidermal necrosis. =Similar diseases with overlapping symptoms= Bullous Pemphigoid, Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Drug Eruptions. Epidermolysis Bullosa, Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, Erythema Multiforme, Lichen Planus, pemphigus vulgaris, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. PNP is most commonly mistaken for pemphigus vulgaris, due to the extreme similarities of the lesions that develop. However, the difference lies in the specificity of the autoreactive antibodies in each case. Treatment =Wound healing= Initial treatment involves addressing any existing infections that may have occurred due to the broken state of the skin. Existing wounds are treated with warm compresses, non-adherent (non-stick) dressing, and topical antibiotic ointment. Immunosuppressive agents are administered in attempt to decrease blistering; this is not often effective. The first medication given aiming to heal the wounds are high dose corticosteroids. This is followed by steroid sparing agents which may reduce steroid intake and therefore lessen the side effects. Skin lesions are more likely to respond to this line of treatment than mucosal lesions. However, a high level of caution is advised in patients with a confirmed malignancy, where immunosuppression is vital and dictates treatment options. If the initial therapy fails to control the symptoms of PNP, and the condition of the patient deteriorates, a more aggressive approach may be necessary. =Medication= Prednisone Prednisone is an immunosuppressive agent which affects all of the organ systems. Effects on the cellular level include cell activation, replication, differentiation, and mobility. The overall goal is to decrease blistering (inhibition of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity) through decreasing the production of autoantibodies. In order to suppress the production of antibodies, higher doses must be administered. Lesser doses can be prescribed in order to achieve suppression of monocyte function. Azathioprine Azathioprine is a steroid-sparing agent used in combination with Prednisone. It functions by inhibiting RNA and DNA synthesis. Ciclosporin Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressive agent most often used in organ transplantation that has demonstrated to be effective with skin disorders. It functions by lessening production of autoantibodies and therefore diminishing the development of blisters and erosions. The mechanism of action is by inhibiting the production of T lymphocytes and lymphokines.  Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an immunomodulator used in combination with systemic steroids to remove bone marrow. This is followed by transplanting peripheral blood stem cells. Prognosis =Quality of life/ Life expectancy= If the lesions are mild, the patient will be subject to a good deal of pain. If the lesions are severe, the overall quality of life is devastating. The impaired skin barrier function commonly leads to localized infection, which sepsis and death may follow. The pain from the oral and pharyngeal ulcers interfere with eating, which can compromise nutritional health. The general prognosis for PNP is poor. It is more hopeful if the tumor is benign, but in the case of malignant tumors, the mortality rate is roughly 90%. The two most commonly associated types of tumors are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; nearly all of these patients die within two years of diagnosis. This is attributed to the effects of the tumor combined with the negative side effects of the medication administered to treat PNP. Roughly 1/3 of the deaths from PNP stem from pulmonary insufficiency which is brought about by the action of PNP on the respiratory mucosa. It manifests as dyspnea and progresses to bronchiolitis obliterans (non-reversible obstructive lung disease) via an unknown mechanism. =Risk Factors= As PNP is ultimately caused by the presence of a tumor, it is not contagious. There is no known way to predict who will become afflicted with it. Patients with cancer are therefore a group at risk. Although PNP has been known to affect all age groups, it is more likely to afflict middle-aged to older patients. Recent research The Development of ELISA testing for specific diagnosis of PNP was released in 2009. The research focuses on the specific determination of autoantibodies involved in the mechanism of PNP. Specifically, antibodies against envoplakin and periplakin were being investigated. Further use of ELISA testing on these antibodies confirmed the presence of anti-envoplakin and anti-periplakin autoantibodies in patients with PNP. Further research in 2013 outlined the various types of assays that could be used to determine which antibodies were involved in PNP. Demonstration of certain antibodies in the serum was named as the basis for diagnosis of PNP. This piece labeled PNP as a \\"multiorgan disease characterized by antibodies against plakins, desmogleins and the Œ±2-macroglobulin-like-1 (A2ML1) protein, in association with an underlying neoplasm\\". A study concluded in 2009, summarized in 2010, surrounded the surgical removal of the associated tumor as a means to treat PNP. While 7/22 of the subjects perished due to resulting infection from the body's inability to heal itself after surgery, the other 15 cases survived. This study outlined the importance of early detection and prompt treatment as of utmost important in the treatment of PNP. In 2011, a case study of a woman with ulcers on the back of her leg reported as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP. A study in 2013 outlined the effectiveness of plasma exchange in PNP patients with benign tumors. The University of Toronto has been working to develop a form of treatment that improves the patient's overall quality of life while remaining economically achievable. They believe they have achieved this through fixed-dose rituximab. It has proven to be effective among auto-immune diseases, but the correct administration process for treating PNP is yet to be defined. The results of the study demonstrated varying levels of remission.

In 1773 Captain Jok released two goats on Arapawa Island's East Bay, and on a subsequent trip in 1777 he gave another pair to a MƒÅori chief in nearby Ship Cove. A few decades later in 1839 a visitor to the whaling settlement on Arapawa Island wrote in his diary that it \\"swarmed\\" with goats. Living peacefully on the island for nearly two centuries, threatened only by the occasional hunter, in the 1970s the little goats on Arapawa Island came under the threat of eradication. It was only through the dedication of Betty Rowe, a resident of Arapawa Island, that the Arapawa goat breed survived a cull by the New Zealand Government's Forest Service. With their priority being the protection of the native fauna and flora on Arapawa Island's reserve, a regular cull of the goats by the Department of Conservation continues. By the dedication of Betty Rowe the goats of Arapawa Island were preserved when the New Zealand Department of Conservation wished to cull them entirely.

It is characterised by the easy and pain free detachment of anagen staged hairs from the scalp. This hair condition can be spontaneous or genetically inherited. Loose anagen syndrome is primarily described in fair-haired children who have easily dislodgeable hair.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . It is commonly present in younger children, generally between the ages of 2 to 8. It is especially observed in female children with light coloured hair. Females and males have differences in hair. There are knowledge gaps about loose anagen syndrome in males, and a 6 to 1 incidence ratio of females to males with loose anagen syndrome, respectively. Loose anagen syndrome may also be misdiagnosed in males, as males traditionally have short hair. Patients with loose anagen hair syndrome usually experience hair thinning around the whole scalp or at the occipital scalp, at the back of the head. Although this is a hair condition, there have only been reports of this condition also affecting the patient‚Äôs eyebrows. There are no noted impacts on any other hairs of the body such as eyebrows and eyelashes. It also does not have any impacts on nails, teeth or skin. Loose anagen syndrome is more predominantly seen in fairer skin and it is not as common in dark skin populations. Abdel-Raouf, El-Din, Awad, Ashraf, Mohammad, Hosan, Hasan, Moetaz, Tag and Mohammad have reported a population of dark skinned individuals with loose anagen syndrome. Each year there are approximately 2 to 2.5 cases per million people with loose anagen hair syndrome.  Causes  The main pathological cause of loose anagen syndrome is the absence or insufficient amount of the inner root sheath in the anagen staged hairs. This creates a gap in the linking between the inner root sheath and the hair cuticles. Both of these hair features stimulate hair growth but with this detachment in the linking, loose anagen hairs are not able to grow to a long length. The abnormalities caused by the inner root sheath creates disruption in the support and anchoring of the anagen hairs. Patients with loose anagen hair syndrome have mutations in the protein keratin K6HF, which is located in the middle of the hair shaft and inner root sheath, the companion layer. These mutations account for the phenotypical features of loose anagen syndrome. In the Huxley cells of the inner root sheath of abnormal anagen hairs, there is the formation of vacuoles and the build-up of fluid which is not usually seen. There are also dyskeratotic modifications in the Henle cells, as well as the cuticle cells in both the inner root sheath and hair shaft. The hair shaft has been reported as thin for some cases and normally structured for other loose anagen syndrome reports. The inner root sheath of normal anagen hairs usually do not have keratin in the Huxley cells, Henle cells and inner root sheath. They are usually organised in an orderly manner and densely compacted. Genetics is one of the causing factors of loose anagen syndrome. It has been studied that this hair condition is autosomal dominantly inherited.  Diagnosis  Patients with loose anagen syndrome do not report the same hair abnormalities. Loose anagen syndrome is usually diagnosed after taking into consideration the physical examination, clinical history and a microscopic examination of the hairs of the patient. Some patients visit a dermatologist for diagnosis and to distinguish between loose anagen hair syndrome and other conditions that it can be misdiagnosed for. A pull test is performed in order to diagnose a patient with loose anagen hair syndrome as one of the characteristics of this hair condition is hair that is easily removed from the scalp. A group of around 40-60 hairs, that are attached to the scalp, is pulled in a clement manner. The patient will be diagnosed with loose anagen syndrome if great amounts of hair is detached from the head. If at least 50% of the hairs removed is at the anagen hair stage, the outcome of the pull test is positive. The detachment of only 4-6 hairs is considered a normal outcome, as approximately 10% of the hairs on the scalp are at the telogen stage. The removed loose anagen hairs are not fragile and are of normal tensile strength. In an electron microscope image of a loose anagen hair, deformities such as grooves, curls and ridges are visible in the hair shaft, which is made from keratin. A cross-sectional examination of a loose anagen hair displays irregularity such as the shape of the hair being triangular rather than oval. The electron microscopy scanned image of the inner root sheath of a loose anagen hair would exhibit ultrastructural changes. These changes are visible in the Huxley layer, Henle layer and the cuticle of the loose anagen hair. An electron microscopy image of outer root sheath of an loose anagen hair would display malformations and weak linkage in the cells within the epithelium of the outer root sheath. This irregularity within the outer root sheath of a loose anagen hair is considered the most notable change when examining a loose anagen hair under an electron microscope. In a histopathological examination, the different layers of the loose anagen hair follicle will display a deficiency of clarity between the layers. This incoherence is also visible in a histological slide of the inner root sheath and of the outer root sheath. Biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis of loose anagen hair syndrome. A biopsy will display non-inflammatory, non-scarring alopecia. The texture of the hair varies with some reports stating that patients with loose anagen syndrome have hairs that are rough, brittle and sticky. This may be the result of the deformations of the hair shaft. These changes in texture limits the ability for adjacent loose anagen hairs to rest flat on the scalp. The patient can have thinning and loss of hair around the whole scalp, at the occipital scalp or around the scalp in odd, irregular patches. Loose anagen syndrome hairs at the occipital scalp can be knotted easily when there‚Äôs movement of those hairs against the pillow at night. There are 3 different types of loose anagen hair syndrome. Loose anagen syndrome type A is when the hair of the patient appears to be fine and thinly distributed. Patients with type A loose anagen syndrome experience a decrease in the density of their hairs. Patients diagnosed with type B loose anagen hair syndrome tend to have hair that is difficult to manage and has a disordered, unruly appearance. Type C loose anagen syndrome is when the hair sheds but the appearance of their hair appears to be normal. Loose anagen syndrome type A and B are more prevalent in children. Loose anagen hair syndrome type C is most frequently seen in adults. There is not specific treatment for each type of loose anagen syndrome. It is also unknown as to how each type is developed. = Differential diagnosis = Loose Anagen Syndrome can commonly be misdiagnosed for other skin and hair disorders such as short anagen syndrome, alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, trichotillomania and toxic ingestion. Similar symptoms and signs appear in these conditions, however there are different aspects that distinguish each one from another. Short anagen syndrome and loose anagen syndrome are similar as both conditions lead to the inability to grow long hair and patients rarely need to get their hair cut. A difference between these two hair disorders is that in loose anagen syndrome there are dystrophic hairs which are absent in patients with short anagen syndrome. Patients with loose anagen syndrome may experience the thinning of their hair which is also a factor of alopecia areata. In order to distinguish between these two conditions, if dots, hairs with tapered roots or vellus hairs are visible in a microscopic examination of the skin this will lead to the diagnosis of alopecia areta rather than loose anagen syndrome. Hair loss can lead to other symptoms and signs such as weight loss, behavioural changes, short temper, abdominal pain and problems with learning. These signs are also observed in children with toxic ingestion which is one of the differential diagnosis. A pull test is also used in the diagnosis of telogen effluvium. The hairs that are removed in a telogen effluvium pull test are telogen staged hairs instead of being at the anagen stage as seen in loose anagen hair syndrome. = Associated conditions = Loose anagen syndrome usually appears as an individual condition. Loose anagen syndrome can be present with other conditions related to genetics or developmental conditions. Examples of these conditions include; Coloboma, Noonan syndrome, Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, EEC (ectrodactyly- ectodermal dysplasia-clefting) syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, Trichotillomania, Nail-patella syndrome and Woolly hair. Loose anagen hair syndrome has also been associated with AIDS. Alopecia areata patients can also develop loose anagen syndrome.  Treatment  Minoxidil chemical structure Loose anagen syndrome usually does not need treatment as this hair condition tends to improve with age and is self-limited. Many patients affected by loose anagen hair syndrome encounter spontaneous recovery by adulthood. The thickness and length of the hair of loose anagen syndrome patients have a tendency to improve and becomes more enhanced, especially post puberty. For some patients, improvement is observed from the ages of 8 or 9. There is still a defect in the connection of the hair shaft and inner root sheath, however it is not as severe and the hairs are not as easily detached as it was for these patients when they were young children. Patients can seek assistance and treatment can be pursued. The aims of treatment is to reduce the trauma being enacted on loose anagen hairs and to reassure loose anagen hair syndrome patients that overtime there will be improvement in the cosmetics of their hair. Paediatricians, paediatric nurse practitioners and physician assistances are usually the first people to detect this hair condition in children. There are no surgical, physical or systemic medical treatment options for loose anagen syndrome. Patients with more severe cases of loose anagen hair syndrome can be treated with minoxidil, a topical medical treatment, as a first line treatment. Minoxidil can extend the duration of the hair in the anagen stage and restore the hair follicles for further growth or for the full period of the anagen phase. The hair of an individual without loose anagen hair syndrome is in the anagen hair phase for approximately 3 to 5 years. Minoxidil can be used as it enriches the cells of the hair by heightening the blood supply of local cutaneous. From this, there is intensified DNA synthesis occurring in both follicular keratinocytes and non-follicular, as well as an increase in cell multiplication. The degree of hair shedding is reduced with the use of minoxidil. 7 in 11 loose anagen hair syndrome patients find visible improvement after using minoxidil lotion. Treatment involving the maintenance of nutrients within the patient and biotin have not made any noted impacts to the improvement of loose anagen hair syndrome. = Management = For children, changes to their lifestyle and daily routine are altered and improved to reduce trauma to hair. This includes modifications in hair maintenance such as different washing, styling and combing techniques are adapted, as an attempt to minimise trauma to loose anagen syndrome hairs. Young girls are also recommended to avoid activities such as extreme braiding. Caring for hair gently will minimise the amount of loosely anchored hairs being removed from scalp.  History  The first published report on loose anagen syndrome was made in 1986 by Nodl and then by Zaun. Loose anagen syndrome was originally referred to as ‚Äòsyndrome of loosely attached hair in childhood‚Äô. The name ‚Äòloose anagen syndrome‚Äô was first adapted in 1989 by Price, Gummer, Hamm and Traupe in American literature. Early literature on loose anagen syndrome all reported identical findings. The genetic aspects and potential mechanisms for the cause of loose anagen syndrome was first discovered in 1992 by Baden, Kvedar and Magro. The ultrastructural changes in loose anagen hairs were examined by Mirmirani, Price and Uno.

This is in contrast to non scarring hair loss. It can be caused by a diverse group of rare disorders that destroy the hair follicle, replace it with scar tissue, and cause permanent hair loss. A variety of distributions are possible.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). Page 647. McGraw-Hill. . In some cases, hair loss is gradual, without symptoms, and is unnoticed for long periods. In other cases, hair loss is associated with severe itching, burning and pain and is rapidly progressive. The inflammation that destroys the follicle is below the skin surface and there is usually no \\"scar\\" seen on the scalp. Affected areas of the scalp may show little signs of inflammation, or have redness, scaling, increased or decreased pigmentation, pustules, or draining sinuses. Scarring hair loss occurs in otherwise healthy men and women of all ages and is seen worldwide. Signs and symptoms It is important to continue to watch for symptoms and signs of active disease during and after treatment to ensure that the disease is responding adequately and has not re- activated after therapy has been discontinued. Response to therapy may be indicated by the resolution of scalp symptoms such as itching, pain, tenderness, or burning, by improvement in the signs of scalp inflammation such as decreased redness, scaling or pustules, and by halting or slowing the progression of hair loss. A dermatologist can document and monitor a patient's cicatricial alopecia using these guidelines, and with the pull test. Photographs of the scalp may be useful in monitoring the course of the disease and response to treatment. Causes The cause of the various cicatricial alopecias is poorly understood. However, all cicatricial alopecias involve inflammation directed at the upper part of the hair follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous gland (oil gland) are located. If the stem cells and sebaceous gland are destroyed, there is then no possibility for regeneration of the hair follicle, and permanent hair loss results. Cicatricial alopecias are not contagious. In general, cicatricial alopecias are not associated with other illnesses, and usually occur in otherwise healthy men and women. Cicatricial alopecias affect both men and women, most commonly adults, although all ages may be affected. Epidemiologic studies have not been performed to determine the incidence of cicatricial alopecias. In general, they are not common. The majority of patients with cicatricial alopecia have no family history of a similar condition. The one exception is Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, which primarily affects women of African ancestry and may occur in several women in the same family. While it is possible to have more than one type of hair loss condition, non-scarring forms of hair loss do not turn into scarring forms of hair loss. Diagnosis A scalp biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia and is the necessary first step, as it can be hard to know the diagnosis for sure without a biopsy.Androgenic pattern presentation of scarring and inflammatory alopecia. Rashid, RM Thomas J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2010 Jan 6. Findings of the scalp biopsy, including the type of inflammation present, location and amount of inflammation, and other changes in the scalp, are necessary to diagnose the type of cicatricial alopecia, to determine the degree of activity, and to select appropriate therapy. Clinical evaluation of the scalp is also important. Symptoms of itching, burning, pain, or tenderness usually signal ongoing activity. Signs of scalp inflammation include redness, scaling, and pustules. However, in some cases there are few symptoms or signs and only the scalp biopsy demonstrates the active inflammation. The overall extent and pattern of hair loss is noted and sometimes photographed for future comparison. A hair \\"pull test\\" is performed to see if growing, or anagen, where hairs are pulled out easily. The pulled hairs are mounted on a slide and the hair bulbs are viewed with a light microscope to determine how many are growing hairs and how many are resting hairs. In addition, if pustules are present, cultures are taken to identify which microbes, if any, may be contributing to the inflammation. A thorough evaluation that includes all of these parameters is important in diagnosing a cicatricial alopecia and in identifying features in individual patients that will help the selection of therapy. New diagnostic techniques, such as trichoscopy may be used for non- invasive differential diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia. Diagnosis and treatment of cicatricial alopecias is often challenging. For this reason, it is helpful to be evaluated by a dermatologist with a special interest or expertise in scalp and hair disorders, and who is familiar with current diagnostic methods and therapies. =Classification = Cicatricial alopecias are classified as primary or secondary. This discussion is confined to the primary cicatricial alopecias in which the hair follicle is the target of the destructive inflammatory process. In secondary cicatricial alopecias, destruction of the hair follicle is incidental to a non-follicle-directed process or external injury, such as severe infections, burns, radiation, tumors, or traction. Primary cicatricial alopecias are further classified by the type of inflammatory cells that destroy the hair follicle during the active stage of the disease. The inflammation may predominantly involve lymphocytes or neutrophils. Cicatricial alopecias that predominantly involve lymphocytic inflammation include lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, central centrifugal alopecia, and pseudopelade (Brocq). Cicatricial alopecias that are due to predominantly neutrophilic inflammation include folliculitis decalvans, tufted folliculitis, and Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Sometimes the inflammation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic process to a lymphocytic process. A cicatricial alopecia with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate is folliculitis keloidalis. Treatment As mentioned above, primary cicatricial alopecias are classified by the predominant type of inflammatory cells that attack the hair follicles, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, or mixed inflammatory cells. Treatment strategies are different for each subtype and detailed treatment options are beyond the scope of this discussion. However, certain general principals are reviewed below. Treatment of the lymphocytic group of cicatricial alopecias (including lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, central centrifugal alopecia, and pseudopelade (Brocq) involves use of anti-inflammatory medications. The goal of treatment is to decrease or eliminate the lymphocytic inflammatory cells that are attacking and destroying the hair follicle. Oral medications may include hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or corticosteroids. Topical medications may include corticosteroids, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, or Derma-Smoothe/FS scalp oil. Triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, may be injected into inflamed, symptomatic areas of the scalp. Treatment of the neutrophilic group of cicatricial alopecias (folliculitis decalvans, tufted folliculitis) is directed at eliminating the predominant pathogenic microbes that are invariably involved in the inflammatory process. Oral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, and topical antibiotics may be used to supplement the oral antibiotics. In dissecting cellulitis, pathogenic microbes are not usually present. Isotretinoin in small doses may be helpful in treating dissecting cellulitis. Treatment of the mixed group of cicatricial alopecias (folliculitis keloidalis) may include antimicrobials, isotretinoin, and anti-inflammatory medications. Patients are recommended to discuss any treatment with a dermatologist, who also explains potential side effects, as well as laboratory tests that are needed before starting treatment and sometimes are monitored during treatment. The course of cicatricial alopecia is usually prolonged. Treatment is continued until the symptoms and signs of scalp inflammation are controlled, and progression of the condition has been slowed. In other words, itching, pain, tenderness, and burning have cleared, scalp redness, scaling, and/or pustules are no longer present, and the progression of the hair loss has been stopped or slowed. Treatment may then be stopped. Unfortunately, the cicatricial alopecias may reactivate after a quiet period and treatment may have to be repeated. Surgical treatment for cosmetic benefit is an option in some cases after the disease has been inactive for one to two or more years. Hair restoration surgery or scalp reduction may be considered in these instances. =Hair regrowth= Hair will not regrow once the follicle is destroyed. However, it may be possible to treat the inflammation in and around surrounding follicles before they are destroyed, and for this reason it is important to begin treatment as early as possible to halt the inflammatory process. Minoxidil solution (2% or 5%) applied twice daily to the scalp may be helpful to stimulate any small, remaining, unscarred follicles. The progression of hair loss is unpredictable. In some cases, progression is slow and there is always sufficient hair remaining to cover the affected scalp areas; in other cases, progression can be rapid and extensive. =Hair care= Hair care products and shampoos can generally be used with any frequency desired, as long as the products are gentle and non-irritating to the scalp. Hair pieces, wigs, hats, and scarves may be used freely.

The original theory was that the hot petrolatum would travel down to the hair root, burn the follicle, and after repetitive injury scarring would result. Later CCCA was realized to affect men and women without a history significant for use of such styling techniques. Consequently, the terms \\"follicular degeneration syndrome\\" per Sperling and Sau in 1992 and then CCCA per Olsent et al. in 2003 were evolved. Plausible contributing factors may include other African-American styling techniques such as relaxers, tight braids, heavy extensions, certain oils, gels or pomades. Presentation CCCA usually begins at the central (sagittal) midline of the scalp. It is symmetric and exhibits scarring as the name suggests. It involves solely the top of the scalp or may progress to Hamilton‚ÄìNorwood scale Type VI or VII. Early symptoms may include pruritus, dysesthesias and tenderness. On examination the skin is thin with few follicular ostia and later in the disease the scalp may appear shiny. Cause The mechanism of pathology of CCCA has only been postulated and not proven. However, one theory involves pressure exerted on the internal root sheath leading to damage, which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the end result of scarring. African Americans are found to be at increased risk either because of the curled hair shaft, distinct styling practices, moisturizing hair products, or chemical processing techniques (especially in the youth population). Some have hypothesized that CCCA represents an end stage of traction alopecia. However, this theory does not ring true as many patients lack a report of traction hairstyling.  Histopathologic features  Histopathologic features include a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate, concentric lamellar fibrosis (layers of fibroblasts in the papillary dermis), sebaceous gland loss and premature disintegration of the internal root sheath. Additionally, granulomatous inflammation secondary to follicular rupture has been noted.Sperling and Sau, 1992 Perifollicular erythema and follicular keratosis is usually absent.  Treatment  Treatments for CCCA remain investigational. Altering hair care practices has not been proven to assist in hair rejuvenation. High-dose topical steroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel), and anti-androgen/5alpha Reductase inhibitors have been used with unknown efficacy.Woolery-lloyd, Heather.

Qabb Ilyas is 15 kilometers from Zahleh and from the Lebanese capital Beirut. Its average elevations is above sea level. Its area is approximately 32 km¬≤. Qabb Ilyas is the third largest city in the Beqaa Valley, after Zahleh and Baalbek in terms of area size and geography. The majority of the residents are Sunni Muslims. Etymology According to the 19th-century Lebanese historian Haydar al-Shihabi, the town was originally called al-Muruj. Local tradition holds that the town's current name \\"Qabb Ilyas\\" is derived from Qabr Elias (\\"grave of Elias\\"), but was shortened over time to Qab Ilyas. Elias was an 8th-century muqaddam from Mount Lebanon, who was killed during a raid in the Beqaa Valley by the forces of the Abbasid governor of Damascus. History In the late 16th century, the Bedouin chieftain of the Beqaa Valley, Mansur ibn Furaykh, used Qabb Ilyas as one of his headquarters. He had a palatial home built in the village. Two years after his execution in Damascus by the Ottoman authorities in December 1593, the Druze sheikh Ali Jumblatt took over the Beqaa Valley during his rebellion against the governor of Damascus Eyalet. During this rebellion, Mansur's home was seized by the Druze Ma'ani emir, Fakhr ad-Din II, who refused to restore it to Mansur's brother Murad ibn Furaykh despite an imperial Ottoman decree. The sons of Mansur, Nasrallah and Muhammad, continued to struggle for control of the property during Fakhr ad-Din's exile as the Shia Harfushi sheikh Yunus al-Harfush took possession of the home.Abu Husayn, pp. 132-133. The Ma'an dynasty built a formidable fortress in Qabb Ilyas that later emirs of Lebanon commissioned during times of rebellion against the Ottomans. Sayyid-Ahmad Shihab occupied Qabb Ilyas in 1773 and robbed a group of Damascene merchants there, for which he was condemned and evicted from the area by his brother Emir Yusuf Shihab.Harris, p. 122. In the mid-1820s, the Ottoman wali of Damascus, Darwish Pasha, defeated Emir Bashir Shihab II and proceeded to demolish most of what remained of the Fakhr ad-Din Castle. He then assigned a Muslim from the Aleppo-based Araqtanji family to govern Qabb Ilyas.Mishaqah, p. 136. During the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, the Druze used Qabb Ilyas, which at the time was a religiously mixed village, as their local headquarters in the Beqaa Valley and it withstood a raid by fighters from the nearby Christian stronghold Zahle.Fawaz, p. 66. During French military intervention in the conflict, the French Army occupied Qabb Ilyas and maintained a military force there to guard the Beqaa Valley and southern Mount Lebanon.Fawaz, pp. 124-125. The Ottomans established an army garrison at Qabb Ilyas at the French withdrawal.Fawaz, p. 179. Archaeological remains Prince Fakhreddin II Castle Ruins The Fakhr ad-Din II Citadel in Qabb Ilyas is believed to have been one of the largest Citadel in the Beqaa Valley. It is also thought to have been built by the Druze prince Fakhr ad-Din II, who chose the location for its elevation and defensibility against potential assaults by the Mamalik military. The citadel was eventually destroyed by the Ottomans, but the ruins remain. Haidara Ruins The Haidara ruins are believed to date back to the Roman era. According to local legend, there was once a mirror on the face of the building that used to reflect sunlight down into the village, related to sun- worshiping Roman practices. Local government Qabb Ilyas is administered by an elected municipal council with six-year terms. It has administrative and financial independence, but remains under the control and supervision of the central government. Demographics It is estimated that Qabb Ilyas had a population of around 50,000 as of 2011.

The skin of these goats is considered to be of high quality because of its large size and its yielding of fine leather such as velour, suede, and chamois for manufacturing clothes, shoes, and gloves. Beetal goats have been widely used for improvement of local goats throughout the subcontinent. These goats are also adapted to stall feeding, thus are preferred for intensive goat farming.

Saunders. . It begins at a central point and spreads outward, leaving scarring, sores, and, due to the inflammation, hair loss in its wake. No permanent cure has been found for this condition, but there is promise in a regimen of dual therapy with rifampin 300 mg twice daily and clindamycin 300 mg twice daily. This new treatment can be used to control the condition, and tests have indicated that after 3 to 5 months long uninterrupted courses of treatment, many patients have seen limited to no recurrence.  Causes  There is no certainty about the cause of this disorder, but the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus has a central role and can be detected in the lesions of most patients. It is unclear if another primarily sterile process with secondary colonization by Staphylococcus aureus is present, or if Staphylococcus aureus starts the process by causing a strong immune reaction. Another possibility is that Staphylococcus aureus produces toxins that act as superantigens which directly activate the T-cells over the variable domain of T-cell receptors. Nonetheless Staphylococcus aureus can by found in almost all patients affected by this disorder, while it is detected in only 20‚Äì30% of non-affected people. As Staphylococcus aureus is not always found in people that suffer from folliculitis decalvans, other factors must be present. Through examinations in families it was found that there is a family connection to the occurrences, which leads to the conclusion that there is a genetic predisposition for it; for example, patients with folliculitis decalvans could have a hereditary different opening of the hair follicle that could facilitate the lodging of the bacteria. Immunologically, another possibility is that especially strong intercellular fixation protein ICAM-1 contributes to inflammation with its strong effect of attracting white blood cells such as granulocytes and lymphocytes. Diagnosis Management  Epidemiology  This disorder was first described by Charles-Eug√®ne Quinquaud in 1888. He isolated bacteria from the hair follicles of affected patients and introduced them in rats, mice and rabbits, with no result. In 1905 it was then differentiated from other scarring alopecias and the name Folliculitis decalvans, that remains current, was introduced. About 11% of the occurrences of scarring alopecias are of this type. Men are more commonly affected than women and its appearance is usually between the late teens and middle adult years. According to studies in the United States, African Americans are more frequently affected than White Americans.

The study looked at prenatal (before birth) and postnatal (after birth) surgery to repair this defect. The first major phase concluded that prenatal surgery had strong, long-term benefits and some risks. The name of the trial stands for Management of Myelomeningocele Study. It was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and was done by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of California, San Francisco, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.  Introduction  Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele, is a type of open neural tube defect that can occur with problems with the early development of a fetus. Most researchers believe that both genetic and environmental factors (such as diet) play a role. During the first 28 days of a pregnancy, the brain and spinal cord form in the developing fetus. The causes of human Spina bifida are not proven. The majority of babies with open spina bifida have a variety of medical problems including nerve damage and problems with motor function, this may include some amount of paralysis of the lower part of their body (this ranges from very mild to quite severe), loss of control of their bowels and bladder, and abnormalities of the brain. Closed spina bifida is probably more common than is currently recognised and includes a range of subtle abnormalities where the neural tube is closed. This is sometimes referred to as spina bifida occulta. Historically, spina bifida was not detected before birth. Maternal serum screening of elevated alpha-fetoprotein at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation, followed by amniocentesis allowed detection of a minority of cases. A better option is the assessment of Acetyl choline Esterase form amniotic fluid. Today, detection rate is 98% at the time of an anatomical screen ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation. For decades the standard treatment has been to close the spinal defect soon after the baby is born. This is called postnatal surgery. It can also be treated through an experimental operation performed while the baby is still in the mother's womb, called prenatal surgery. The benefits of prenatal surgery remain unproven. History 1980 - Fetal surgical techniques using animal models were first developed at the University of California, San Francisco by Dr. Michael R. Harrison, Dr. N. Scott Adzick and colleagues. 1994 - The surgical model that is most similar to simulating the human disease is the fetal lamb model of myelomeningocele (MMC) introduced by Meuli and Adzick in 1994. The MMC-like defect was surgically created at 75 days of gestation (term 145 to 150 days) by a lumbo-sacral laminectomy. Approximately 3 weeks after creation of the defect a reversed latissimus dorsi flap was used to cover the exposed neural placode and the animals were delivered by cesarean section just prior term. Human MMC-like lesions with similar neurological deficit were found in the control newborn lambs. In contrast, animals that underwent closure had near- normal neurological function and well-preserved cytoarchitecture of the covered spinal cord on histopathological examination. Despite mild paraparesis, they were able to stand, walk, perform demanding motor test and demonstrated no signs of incontinence. Furthermore, sensory function of the hind limbs was present clinically and confirmed electrophysiologically. Further studies.showed that this model when combined with a lumbar spinal cord myelotomy leads to the hindbrain herniation characteristic of the Chiari II malformation and that in utero surgery restores normal hindbrain anatomy. Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Dr. Joseph Bruner, attempted to close spina bifida in 4 human fetuses using a skin graft from the mother using specialized telescope called a laparoscope. Four cases were performed before stopping the procedure - two of the four fetuses died. 1998 - Dr. N. Scott Adzick and team at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia performed open fetal surgery for spina bifida in an early gestation fetus (22-week gestation fetus) with a successful outcome. Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Dr. Noel Tulipan, made an incision in the mother's uterus to obtain better exposure to fetuses of 28 to 30 weeks gestation. All 4 fetuses were born premature but with evidence of reversal of their chiari II malformation. Only 2 of the 4 required ventricular shunts after birth. Fetal surgery after 25 weeks has not shown benefit in subsequent studies Subsequently, 4 medical centers conducted 253 open spina bifida repairs prior to the MOMs trial. The outcomes were mixed and the only comparison groups were other children that had not undergone repair after birth in the past.\\"Fetal Surgery for Spina Bifida Video\\". Retrieved on 7 December 2011. In February 2003, the National Institutes of Health began the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS). Three centers (Vanderbilt University, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California at San Francisco) were chosen to participate in the study of 183 fetuses which were randomized, 91 for fetal repair and 92 for postnatal repair. The study took 8 years to complete at a cost of $22.5 million.Belluck, Pam. \\"Success of Spina Bifida Study Opens Fetal Surgery Door\\", \\"The New York Times\\", 9 February 2011. Retrieved on 7 December 2011. Of the 1,087 fetuses and mothers initially screened for the study, 183 met all the inclusion criteria. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia treated 77 patients, University of California at San Francisco treated 54 and Vanderbilt University treated 52. Prenatal surgery was done at the assigned center between 19 and 25 weeks of pregnancy. Deliveries for both groups were performed by C-section at the assigned MOMS Center at approximately 37 weeks of pregnancy. The infants in the postnatal surgery group had their spina bifida closed at the MOMS Center as soon as possible after delivery, usually within 48 hours. Medical information on the mothers and babies were gathered throughout the study and follow-up of their progress continued until the child reached at least two and a half years of age. Two outcomes were considered. The first, at 12 months, was death or need for a ventricular shunt. The second, measured at 30 months, was a composite score of standardized tests for mental and motor development. Outcomes of the Trial An interim analysis conducted in December 2010, made public in February 2011, and released in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2011, showed a statistically significant benefit to the surgery and closed the trial. The trial demonstrated that outcomes after prenatal spina bifida treatment are improved to the degree that the benefits of the surgery typically outweigh the maternal risks. Specifically, the study found that: * Babies that underwent fetal repair of spina bifida were half as likely to need a ventricular shunt. * Chiari malformation was less common in the fetal repair group. * Standardized test scores for motor skills were superior in the fetal surgery group, and twice as many children were walking independently at 30 months as compared to the postnatal surgery group. Based on these outcomes, fetal repair of spina bifida is now considered a standard of care at some fetal centers. However, prenatal repair is a complex and challenging procedure, requiring the most expert, comprehensive care for both mother and fetus. The surgical team's level of experience in all aspects of care surrounding the operation are of paramount importance. Therapy that is highly dependent on the provider is of limited benefit to the wider population.

P. Herbert, which aimed to highlight the perceived inadequacies and absurdities of contemporary divorce law. The book took a particularly lenient view of the need for divorces, which it characterised as \\"a relief from misfortune, not a crime\\",DiFonzo, p.35. The quote may originally be from E. S. P. Haynes and demonstrated how the current system created an environment which encouraged the participants to commit perjury and adultery. The book was a major element in the popular debate about the liberalisation of divorce law in the mid-1930s, and helped pave the way for the 1937 statutory reforms. Background In the 1920s and 1930s, English law did not allow for divorce by mutual consent, but rather required proof of adultery, or violence by one party; misconduct by both parties could lead to the divorce being refused. Divorce was seen as a remedy for the innocent against the guilty. So this had the weird consequence, castigated in the book, that if one spouse had committed adultery, they could be divorced, but if both had, they couldn't ‚Äì unless the court chose to exercise its discretion. That discretion was itself covered by peculiar rules of its own. To add a further hurdle, the law strictly prohibited \\"collusion\\" by the parties. This could extend to any sort of negotiation between them. An official‚Äîthe King's Proctor‚Äîwas charged with seeking out any evidence of the parties working together to secure a divorce. Many couples of the time chose to petition on the grounds of adultery, even when no adultery had been committed. In this situation, a popular solution was what was known as \\"hotel evidence\\": the man and an uninvolved woman would travel to a seaside resort for a weekend, and go around publicly and ostentatiously as husband and wife. In the morning, they would take great care to be observed by the chambermaid in bed together when she brought in their breakfast. The pair would return home, and when the case came to court the maid would be called on to give evidence as a witness to this fictitious \\"adultery\\". After the trial, there would then be a six-month waiting period until the decree nisi granted at the trial was made absolute, and any misconduct by the \\"innocent\\" party in this time‚Äîor any evidence of collusion coming to light‚Äîcould annul the divorce. In effect, to secure an amicable divorce, one or both of the couple would have to commit perjury several times over‚Äîand potentially be liable for criminal penalties in so doing. Whilst the courts would often turn a blind eye to it, this was by no means guaranteed, and a system which virtually mandated perjury was felt by many to be scandalous. Origins Divorce law reform had long been one of Herbert's \\"small causes\\", for which he agitated in the pages of Punch. His first attempt to bring this particular cause to a broader audience was a play, The White Witch (1924), concerning a couple in a divorce suit who both protest that they had not committed adultery. The play was a failure, and closed after six weeks; Herbert felt that the \\"fatal\\" problem had been that \\"nobody made love\\" in the play. Arnold Bennett wrote that he was \\"very disappointed indeed\\" by it, and E. V. Lucas wrote that he loathed \\"adultery discussions in public. The theatre ... should be jollier than that\\".Pound, pp.86‚Äì87 Herbert had written three novels, with varying degrees of success. The Secret Battle (1919), a critically acclaimed war novel, sold poorly on its original publication but was republished in 1930, and went through five subsequent editions.Pound, p.97 The House by the River (1920) was a little-noted crime novel, which began to introduce elements of comedy into a tragic storyline,.Pound, p.66 The Water Gipsies (1930), a story about canal life, was a broad success, which went on to sell a quarter of a million copies and attract comparison to the works of Charles Dickens.Pound, p.99 By 1932, he was contemplating a fourth novel to capitalise on this last success; his editor at Punch, E. V. Knox, encouraged him to put aside his theatrical work to focus on writing it.Pound, p.113 He chose to make another attempt at writing on the theme of divorce reform. During a sailing holiday around Brittany with Sir Edward Spears and his wife Mary Borden in late 1932, he filled a notebook with the outline of what was to become Holy Deadlock.Pound, pp.113‚Äì114 Before the novel was published, however, he took up the theme in one of his Misleading Cases, \\"Not a Crime\\".Uncommon Law, pp. 425‚Äì458 This was first published in Still More Misleading Cases (1933), and unusually does not seem to have been published in Punch beforehand.See publication notes, by David Langford In this, he presented an innocent couple, married in haste during the First World War, who wished to divorce. The reader was told that after a farcical series of events had spun the case out, the decree nisi was refused because the wife (the petitioner) had been unfaithful after the trial, at which point the husband announced that he was fed up with the whole business and, as a party who was actually innocent, would it be possible for him to divorce his wife rather than the other way around? This led to a certain quandary: \\"Either Mr. Pale has committed misconduct, in which case the couple cannot be divorced, or he has not committed misconduct, in which case he can be sent to prison for pretending that he has\\".Uncommon Law, p.453 In this case, Herbert was able to let his judge give the \\"right\\" answer to the dilemma: he declared that the marriage was dissolved upon the suit of both parties, with no guilt attaching to either, and gave a two-page conclusion in which he decried the law as \\"illogical, cruel, barbarous and disgusting\\".Uncommon Law, p. 458 Plot summary The novel's plot is very similar to that of \\"Not a Crime\\", expanded and presented with a tragic ending rather than the earlier deus ex machina. The protagonists are a faultless and honest young couple, with the everyman names of John Adam and Mary Eve, who married impetuously, are now amicably separated, and wish to divorce so that they can remarry; neither has committed adultery nor desired to. Because of the lack of legal provision, they are compelled to collude to present a fictional cause for divorce; Mary asks Adam to \\"act like a gentleman\\" and provide the pretext, as her fianc√©, Martin Seal, cannot be named as a co-respondent without risking his job (he works as an announcer for the BBC). After his first attempt to obtain the necessary evidence, the maid refuses to identify him in court and the case collapses; at the second attempt, his \\"partner\\" develops measles and has to be supported in the hotel for several weeks at great expense. A decree nisi is granted but, during the waiting period, Mary spends the night with Seal and is reported by an acquaintance to the King's Proctor, who reports that the divorce should not be granted. She fights the case, but the judge refuses to exercise any discretion in her favour, and declines to grant a divorce. By the end of the book, Mary and Adam are separated but remain legally married. Seal has lost his position after being named in the final court case, but can choose to live with Mary without excessive social stigma. However, John is a broken man, legally unable to marry his lover‚Äîand, as she is a school headmistress, socially unable to continue associating with her.A one-page synopsis is in Gallagher, p. 145 On the last page, he departs in the company of a prostitute, announcing that he intends to \\"behave like a gentleman‚Äîat last!\\" Reaction The book sold more than ninety thousand copies,Pound, p.116 and was selected by the Book of the Month Club in the United States. It was widely discussed at the time, and was a \\"sensation on both sides of the Atlantic\\".DiFonzo, p.35 It has been compared to Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust, which also described a wealthy couple colluding to obtain a divorce, although the two were very different in tone.Gallagher, p.144 Public reaction was widespread, with Herbert receiving a vast amount of correspondence, much of it under the belief that he himself was unhappily married. Rudyard Kipling summarised much of the reaction when he wrote that the book made him \\"...sick. I knew things were pretty heathen in that department... but I didn't realise they were worse than heathen\\". The novel has been noted as a major step in influencing public opinion to support a liberalisation of the divorce laws, though Herbert himself would claim that it merely \\"helped to create a more favourable attitude\\".Pound, p.117 From a legal standpoint, it has been seen as a \\"classically excellent\\" example of how to provide complex legal exposition through fiction, and at one point was used as a textbook;Gallagher, p. 146 a legal reviewer described it as \\"a singularly accurate presentation of the law [and] an admirable picture of divorce practice in England\\".University of Toronto Law Journal (1935), p.221 As well as the facts of the law, the novel detailed the practical intricacies which were routinely used to get around it, and highlighted the absurdity and human costs of the existing situation.Gallagher, p. 145 However, it focused almost entirely on the legal aspects; the broader social issues were not discussed, and the opponents of reform portrayed as \\"only self-righteous bigots and nice old clergymen incapable of reason\\". The lawyers were shown as disinterested and well- informed figures who would tirelessly pursue what they saw as their client's best interests,Gallagher, p. 145-6 whilst the protagonists themselves were \\"sacrificed ... to the sociology, but they do it with a good grace\\".Review in The Times, p.7, 6 April 1934 The political overtones of the \\"frankly polemical attack\\"Gallagher, p.135 were noted, and a shortly after publication a question was raised in the House of Commons by Frederick Macquisten, who felt that, as a result of the book, \\"His Majesty's judges and courts, and the legal code which they administer in matrimonial causes, are held up to public ridicule and contempt\\"; the Attorney-General declined to pursue the matter.Hansard, 13 June 1934, vol. 290 col. 1690 Later developments Herbert continued his campaign after the publication of the book, with significant success. In 1935, he was elected to the House of Commons as an Independent Member of Parliament for Oxford University, and in his maiden speech vowed to introduce a private bill to reform divorce law. This Bill was eventually introduced in 1936, and became law as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, a process described in his book The Ayes Have It. It was reported in 1939 that a film of the book was planned for the following year,The Times, p.12, 1 December 1938 but it never appeared. Herbert, who had written the treatment, believed that it was vetoed by the film censor because \\"that official has always been a Catholic\\".Pound, p. 121 Herbert would return to the theme of matrimonial law reform‚Äîin this case, the remarriage of divorcees‚Äîin his novel Made for Man (1957).

April 21, 1990 Escalona started with murals and sculptures in the alleyway Callej√≥n de Hamel, near University of Havana. For sculptures he used scrap objects like bathtubs, hand pumps, pin wheels etc., and for the murals he used different kind of available paint, including car enamel. Even though the first four years became difficult, he was inspired by local inhabitants and visitors to continue his work, and little by little, the street was transformed from a slum area to an enthusiastic Afro-Cuban centre. Today there are workshops for young Cuban children to learn painting. Every Sunday there are rumba performances, and every Friday Cuban music in the street.

He made his debut for the club on 13 September 1913 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers but went on to make just two more appearances for the club before being sold to Oldham Athletic at the end of the 1913‚Äì14 season for ¬£100. In his first season at Boundary Park he scored eight goals in 16 games as he helped Oldham to a second-place finish in Division One. However, Cashmore was later hampered by injuries and left the club, playing for non- league side Darlaston. Following the resumption of league football at the end of the First World War, Cashmore joined Southern Football League side Cardiff City, finishing his first season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. He remained with the club on their entry into The Football League the following year, forming a partnership with Jimmy Gill and playing in their first Football League match, a 5‚Äì2 win over Stockport County, as well as later becoming the first player to score a Football League goal at Ninian Park in the return fixture between the two teams on 4 September 1920.

It was part of a war of succession within Serbia, in which the Byzantines intervened on behalf of the deposed Grand Prince Tihomir of Serbia against his rebellious younger brother, Prince Nemanja, who emerged victorious and was crowned afterwards. Background Prince Nemanja of Ibar, Toplica, Rasina and Reke was the inferior of his lord and older brother, Grand Prince Tihomir of Serbia. When Nemanja had built monasteries without consulting Tihomir, the latter had Nemanja captured and chained, and his lands seized as well. But Nemanja's supporters within the clergy, who had welcomed his construction of churches and thus granted him their respect, conspired to have him released.Fine 1994, p. Nemanja was later freed, and regained rule in some of his previous lands. Next, he successfully overthrew Tihomir, who fled to the Byzantines with his brothers. Battle A Byzantine army was assembled for the Byzantine ally Tihomir, who came in from Skopje. The two armies collided at Pantina near Zveƒçan, present-day Kosovo. After a decisive battle, the Byzantine force was crushed and quickly began retreating. Tihomir drowned in the Sitnica river and Nemanja's remaining brothers were pardoned, recognising Stefan Nemanja as the supreme ruler of Serbia, crowned as \\"Ruler of All Serbia\\". Aftermath The battle was decisive in the fact that it ensured the unity of all Serbian princes and their ultimate loyalty to Stefan Nemanja. This later paved the way for the consolidation of Serbia and its eventual formation into a kingdom.

It takes its name from the massif of the Adamello, part of the Adamello-Presanella subsection of the Rhaetian Alps. It is raised mainly in the Val Camonica, the Val Saviore and the mountains of Brescia; some are found in neighbouring areas of the provinces of Bergamo to the west and Trento to the east. It was in the past known simply as the Capra Bionda or as the Must√†scia. History The breed appears to be of ancient origin. While it shares some characteristics with the Swiss Toggenburger, notably the \\"Swiss markings\\" (white facial stripes, white lower limbs and peri-anal area), it was already established well before the importation of Toggenburg billies to the area, documented from the years before and after the Second World War. A painting from about 1760 by the Milanese painter Francesco Londonio (1723‚Äì1786) shows a goat of Bionda dell'Adamello type, with typical coat and facial markings. The Bionda dell'Adamello is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. The herd-book was activated in 1997. At the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 3148 and as 2772. Use The milk yield per lactation of the Bionda dell'Adamello is for secondiparous, and for pluriparous, nannies. The milk averages 3.16% fat and 2.97% protein.

His regular position was as a forward. Early life Foggon was born in West Pelton, County Durham before moving to nearby Craghead where his father had taken up a job as a miner. Club career While playing for his school, Foggon was spotted by Newcastle United who invited him to train twice a week with the club's youth side before signing as an apprentice in 1967 under manager Joe Harvey. Having graduated from the junior and reserve sides at the club, he made his first-team debut just days before his 18th birthday, in a 0‚Äì0 draw at Arsenal. A schoolboy sprint champion, Foggon's moment of glory came in the second leg of the 1969 Fairs Cup Final in Budapest when his shot was pushed onto the crossbar by the Ujpest 'keeper, but the United man followed up to lash the ball into the net and make it 3‚Äì2 on the night, 6‚Äì2 on aggregate. He moved on to Cardiff City in August 1971 after falling out of favour following the signing of Malcolm Macdonald. However, after struggling to establish himself in the first-team and growing disillusioned with the standard of football in the reserve leagues at the club, he began to feel homesick and was unfit. The club received an offer for Foggon from Middlesbrough and Cardiff manager Jimmy Scoular gave him the option of accepting the offer which Foggon did. The fee for the transfer was ¬£10,000 and the deal also saw Johnny Vincent move to Cardiff. Foggon became a favourite of the Ayresome Park crowd and helped the Teessiders to promotion from Division Two in 1974. After brief stints with Rochester Lancers and Hartford Bicentennials in the United States, Foggon moved to Manchester United in 1976. That proved to be something of a disaster though and after just three league outings at Old Trafford he switched to Sunderland. Later moves took him to Southend United, Hartlepool United (loan), Consett. and Whitley Bay. He finished his career as one of only a few players who have played for all three of the North East's big three clubs. Life after football Remaining on South Tyneside, Foggon worked in the security business and the pub trade, in Spennymoor and South Shields.

Based on the 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, which also inspired the Walt Disney animated film, this version featured a now-forgotten new score by Alec Wilder and William Engvick. It was telecast once on NBC as a television special, and, as far as is known, never rebroadcast by NBC, or even restaged with a different cast as was Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella. Nor has it ever been issued on VHS or DVD. Other notable actors who appeared in the special included Walter Slezak (as Geppetto), Fran Allison (as the Blue Fairy), Martyn Green (as the Fox), Jerry Colonna (as a Ringmaster), and Stubby Kaye as a Town Crier, a role he repeated in Wilder and Engvick's 1958 television musical, Hansel and Gretel. Pinocchio was directed by noted Broadway choreographer Hanya Holm. This was the second of many versions of Pinocchio that have been written especially for television, the most recent being in 2008. The first television Pinocchio was a satirical version featured as an episode of The Spike Jones Show in 1954. Jones himself played the title role. The 1957 special was one of many children's fantasy musical specials to be shown on television between 1955 and 1959 in the wake of the enormously successful first two telecasts of the Mary Martin musical Peter Pan. One novel touch about the 1957 Pinocchio was that when the puppet finally became a real boy, pieces of wood began falling off of his body onto the floor. Although it has been erroneously claimed that the program no longer exists, it has apparently survived on kinescope.http://wilderworld.podomatic.com/entry/2007-10-13T21_52_42-07_00 And after languishing in obscurity for years, a cast album of the show has been issued on CD.https://www.amazon.com/Pinocchio-Sound-Track-Bonus- Tracks/dp/B001E1BOAY According to sources, however, Gordon B.

These districts are not specified by national Swedish law, but rather are created by individual municipalities, and thus the Swedish names of these districts vary greatly from municipality to municipality, including kommundelar, stadsdelar, stadsdelomr√•den, prim√§romr√•den, or stadsdelsn√§mndsomr√•den. The degree of administrative autonomy of these districts similarly varies greatly, but is normally very limited. I 2016 a new form of division of Sweden was introduced. This division is called Districts or Registration districts, in Swedish Distrikt. These are used for certain administrative purposes by some national authorities, such as land ownership and statistics. This is not the same as the urban districts which are divisions held by some municipalities. Stockholm =Overview= The city council (kommunfullm√§ktige) of Stockholm Municipality has divided the city into smaller subdivisions. The city uses the English term \\"district\\" (Swedish: stadsdelomr√•de) to describe these subdivisions. The districts were first created in 1997 to facilitate the efficiency of local government in Stockholm. The number of districts was reduced from 24 to 18 the following year, and reduced again to the current 14 in 2007. Since the establishment of these districts, certain administrative tasks, such as school administration were re-centralized. Each district has its own district administration, led by a district council, which is responsible for certain areas of municipal governance within their district, including pre-school education, park maintenance, local economic initiatives, elderly services, financial counseling, and refugee reception services. Individual district councils have no power over city planning or tax policy, both of which are retained by the central city council.City of Stockholm: \\"District Councils\\"City of Stockholm: \\"Stockholm by districts\\" The councilors that serve on these district councils are often part-time politicians, also holding other employment. They are preferably residents of the district whose council they serve upon. The central city council itself is responsible for setting the budget, goals, and responsibilities of the district councils. The city council also appoints the members of each district council, so the political makeup of the district council resembles that of the central city council, not necessarily that of the district. The member of the district council are not elected in any fashion by the residents of the district in question. Stockholm's 14 districts are sometimes divided into smaller parts for statistical purposes, however these smaller districts have no administrative function in the city's governance. Administrative districts in Stockholm Municipality =Districts= Stockholm has 14 districts as of the administrative changes made in 2007: * √Ñlvsj√∂ * Bromma * Enskede-√Örsta-Vant√∂r * Farsta * H√§gersten-Liljeholmen * H√§sselby-V√§llingby * Kungsholmen * Norrmalm * √ñstermalm * Rinkeby-Kista * Sk√§rholmen * Skarpn√§ck * S√∂dermalm * Sp√•nga-Tensta Gothenburg =Overview= Gothenburg Municipality (G√∂teborgs stad) is also divided into subdivisions which it refers to as \\"districts\\" in English, though as with Stockholm's districts, they are often referred to as boroughs in unofficial contexts. The Swedish term used by the city council is stadsdelsn√§mndsomr√•den (literally \\"city-part committee area\\"). These districts were created in 1990. Just like in Stockholm, these districts each have a local governing body which Gothenburg calls \\"district committees.\\" These committees serve a nearly identical function to Stockholm's district councils, including recreation, local economic issues and social services, and the lower levels of the education system, and like Stockholm's councils, these committees are appointed by the centralized city council.City of G√∂teborg: District Committees Gothenburg is divided into 21 districts, each with a district committee. These 21 districts can be further divided into 94 subdivisions (called prim√§romr√•den) which exist only for statistical and organizational purposes, and serve no administrative function. =Districts= The 21 districts of Gothenburg and the premi√§romr√•den enclosed within each:City of G√∂teborg: Prim√§romr√•den (Swedish) * Askim ** Askim ** Hov√•s ** Billdal * Backa ** Backa ** Brunnsbo ** Skogome ** Sk√§lltorp * Bergsj√∂n ** V√§stra Bergsj√∂n ** √ñstra Bergsj√∂n * Biskopsg√•rden ** Norra Biskopsg√•rden ** S√∂dra Biskopsg√•rden ** J√§ttesten ** Svartedalen ** L√§nsmansg√•rden * Centrum ** Guldheden ** Heden ** Johanneberg ** Kroksl√§tt ** Landala ** Stampen ** Vasastaden ** Lorensberg ** Inom Vallgraven * Fr√∂lunda ** J√§rnbrott ** Tofta ** Ruddalen ** Fr√∂lunda Torg * Gunnared ** L√∂vg√§rdet ** Rannebergen ** G√•rdstensbergen ** Angereds Centrum * H√§rlanda ** H√§rlanda ** K√•lltorp ** Torpa ** Bj√∂rkek√§rr * H√∂gsbo ** Kaver√∂s ** Flat√•s ** H√∂gsboh√∂jd ** H√∂gsbotorp ** H√∂gsbo * Kortedala ** Gamlestaden ** Utby ** S√∂dra Kortedala ** Norra Kortedala * K√§rra-R√∂dbo ** K√§rra ** R√∂dbo * Linn√©staden ** Masthugget ** √Ñngg√•rden ** Haga ** Annedal ** Olivedal * Lundby ** Sanneg√•rden ** Br√§mareg√•rden ** Kvilleb√§cken ** Sl√§ttadamm ** K√§rrdalen * L√§rjedalen ** Hammarkullen ** Hj√§llbo ** Eriksbo ** Agnesberg ** Linnarhult ** Gunnilse ** Bergum * Majorna ** Kungsladug√•rd ** Sanna ** Majorna ** Stigberget * Styrs√∂ ** Styrs√∂ * Torslanda ** Hjuvik ** Nolered ** Bj√∂rlanda ** Arendal * Tuve-S√§ve ** Tuve ** S√§ve * Tynnered ** Bratthammar ** Guldringen ** Skatteg√•rden ** √Ñng√•s ** √ñnnered ** Greveg√•rden ** N√§set ** Kanneb√§ck * √Ñlvsborg ** Fiskeb√§ck ** L√•ngedrag ** Hagen ** Grimmered * √ñrgryte ** Olskroken ** Redbergslid ** Bagareg√•rden ** Kalleb√§ck ** Sk√•r ** √ñver√•s ** K√§rralund ** Lunden Malm√∂ Malm√∂'s city districts. =Overview= Malm√∂ Municipality (Malm√∂ stad) is divided into five districts ().

Historical background Long before the coming of the Spaniards to Zamboanga, the place has no name. And this is how Putik got its name. At the time when the Spaniards occupied Zamboanga, they usually go around to see different places. One day, they met a tradesman who came from Luzon. The tradesman accompanied by the Spaniards went sight-seeing around the place. It was a rainy season that time and the soil seemed like clay, and so it was slippery. While they were walking, one of the Spaniards stumbled down. He suddenly stood up and asked the trader what was the name of the place. He answered ‚Äúputik‚Äù, he meant muddy. That knowing the tradesman does not know Spanish. From that time and until now, they call this place as PUTIK.

Design and construction The engineering design of the plant was by Ralph C. Roe and Allen Burns of the firm of Burns and Roe, and represented an improvement over the design of the Bremo Station in Virginia, which the two had designed while employed at Electric Management and Engineering Company. The architectural design was by Edwyn A. Bowd of Bowd and Munson. Construction began in 1937 and, due to material shortages caused by the outbreak of World War II, completed in two phases. The first phase, which consisted of the southern half of the building, was completed in 1939. The second phase was completed in 1946. In total, the project cost $4 million, all of it from ratepayers without the issuance of bonds or government funds.Cosention, Lawrence, \\"First Life of a landmark\\", Lansing City Pulse, published March 31, 2011 The tall Art Deco step-back structure sits on a polished black granite water table, with an intricate exterior design of multicolor brick. The design symbolizes the combustion of coal, and graduates from dark purple at the base through reds and orange in the middle, to light yellow at the top, alternating with bands of limestone, and with limestone parapets and trim. The Ottawa Street station was praised for its engineering and architecture in trade publications of the day, and immediately became the city's preeminent Art Deco landmark. Bowd subsequently designed a number of other prominent Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in the Lansing area, including the J.W. Knapp Company Building.Cosentino, Lawrence, \\"The belly of the phoenix\\" Lansing City Pulse (March 26, 2009) Operating History The Ottawa Street station provided electricity and steam to the downtown Lansing area from 1939 through 1989. The plant had a generating capacity of 81,500-kilowatts. By 1971, improvements at the Board of Water and Light's Eckert Station permitted the Ottawa Street Station to operate as a backup station for electric generation. It continued to provide steam service into the 1980s. In 1984, the Board of Water and Light's Eckert Station began providing steam service, initially as a backup to the Ottawa Street Station, but eventually as the primary steam service source. As equipment became obsolete, it was removed from the Ottawa Street Station, and ultimately it was decommissioned in 1992 for electric and steam. In 2001, a portion of the station was renovated to provide chilled water service for air conditioning.Mulcahy, Marty, \\"Big chill project revives Ottawa Street Station\\", The Building Tradesman (January 19, 2001) It continued to operate as a water chilling plant until September 2009, when the Board of Water and Light completed a new chilled water plant in downtown Lansing.Cosnentino, Lawrence, \\"The greatest show in town\\", Lansing City Pulse (September 9, 2009)Prater, Kathryn \\"BWL dedicates new chilled water plant\\" Lansing State Journal (September 16, 2009) Redevelopment Following decommissioning, the City of Lansing explored various options for redevelopment of the Ottawa Street Station.

William Henderson was appointed professor of general pathology at the University of Edinburgh and physician-in-ordinary to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He authored important articles on the clinical and pathological aspects of aortic and heart disease. He also contributed to the recognition as separate diseases of typhus and typhoid fever. Henderson was early advocate for homeopathy in Scotland and was at the centre of the controversy surrounding the introduction of homeopathy to Edinburgh in the early 1840s. This involved the Faculty of Medicine, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) and medical societies as well as prominent medical figures of the period including Sir John Forbes, Professor Sir James Simpson, Professor Sir Robert Christison and Professor James Syme. Many Scottish physicians were influenced by Henderson's teachings and they in turn were involved in the wider introduction of homeopathy in Britain. In his retirement Prof. Henderson was author to a reference work on the Bible that gave ample evidence of his extensive religious knowledge and deeply held convictions. He is buried, with his wife Williamina and other members of his family, against the north wall of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh.

They are located near the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern Great Barrier Reef, due east of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, and north of the state capital Brisbane. The island is the third island in the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands (with the first being Lady Elliot Island), and is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of islands and forms part of the Capricornia Cays National Park as well as of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. Most people only see the island by the more easily reached Lady Musgrave Island, which can be readily reached by fast catamaran from Bundaberg (4 hours north of Brisbane), the town of 1770, Queensland, or from Gladstone, both of which are located approximately five hours drive north of Brisbane. Fairfax Islands *East Fairfax *West Fairfax Geomorphology and landscape The eastern cay is composed of shingle and the western of sand and shingle. Interference with the vegetation of the eastern cay occurred as a result of phosphate mining and secondly during the period when the Australian Military Forces used the area as a bombing target. The cay is no longer used for either purposes. Vegetation is dominated by Pisonia grandis which is restricted to the centre of the island. Two brackish pools are located towards the eastern end of the island. The western cay features an elongated sand spit that supports vegetation on its western extremity. Vegetation is similar to that occurring on the larger sand cays of the Capricorn Group. A tin shed, erected by the Australian Navy when the eastern cay was used for bombing practice, is located in the centre of the island. The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef (Hopley 1982). The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day. Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5,000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plain on which today's reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6,000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays. Fairfax Islands area a Closed Ring Reefs and the two coral cays belong to two distinct types:Fairbridge, R. W. 1950b. Recent and Pleistocene coral reefs of Australia. J. Geol. 58: 330-401 *1. Vegetated sand cays:- Fairfax (West). *2. Shingle cays:- Fairfax (East). History =Discovery= In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group. During a second whaling voyage from England in Albion he discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast. Albion was 362 tons and registered in London, the ship was fitted with 10 guns, and had a crew of 26; she was built in Deptford, Britain, and owned by, Messrs. Champion; and used for general cargo. The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Royal Navy Lieutenant Phillip Parker King initially aboard Mermaid and later in Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Blackwood in which was accompanied by . The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. =Mining of guano in the 1890s= The mining of guano (bird droppings) occurred on Lady Musgrave Island, Fairfax and North West Island during the 1890s. This was an extension of a more substantial guano mining operation on Lady Elliot Island to the south. Some remains of these activities are still evident. A good description of part of the operations from 1899 can be found below > The Pacific Islands Company, having worked cut the guano deposits at Fairfax > Island, Bunker Group, is now transferring their plant to North-west Island > In the Capricorn Group, which will be \\"the head- quarters for some time to\\" > come (says the \\"Bundaberg Star\\" of yesterday).

It commonly occurs as one of two subtypes, cardiomyopathic neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD-M), or ichthyotic neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD-I) which is also known as Chanarin‚ÄìDorfman syndrome), which are characterized primarily by myopathy and ichthyosis, respectively. Normally, the ichthyosis that is present is typically non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma which appears as white scaling. It has been associated genetically with mutations in the CGI58 gene, (for NLSD-I), or the ATGL gene (for NLSD-M.)

Myopathy is defined as a disease of the muscle tissue. Ichthyosis is a skin related disease in which the skin becomes very scaly, thick, and dry. =Genetics= Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) occurs in one of two genetic and clinical subtypes. Both subtypes are autosomal recessive disorders, meaning that a mutant allele must be inherited from both parents in order to cause disease. Subtype I: Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy (NLSD-M), is caused by a mutation in the PNPLA2 gene, which reduces the normal expression orfunction of the ATGL protein. PNPLA2 is located on chromosome 11 ‚ÄúNeutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy.‚Äù Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. May 8, 2014. ATGL is an enzyme involved in catabolism of triglycerides (long-term fat storage) into fatty acids (short-term fat storage) within the body In the absence of fully functional ATGL, triglycerides accumulate in the bloodstream and bodily tissues. Interestingly, individuals with NLSD are not typically obese. It has been proposed that the assimilation, rather than degradation of triglycerides is the main factor in fat accumulation in adipose cells . In the absence of functional ATGL, triglycerides accumulate in the bloodstream and bodily tissues. Interestingly, individuals with NLSD are not typically obese.

Patients with NLSD-M display progressive skeletal myopathy and severe cardiomyopathy in ~40% of cases. The pathophysiology and mechanistic basis of myopathy arising from deficits is lipid metabolism is not yet known. Subtype II: Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Ichthyosis (NLSD-I), or Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, is caused by a mutation in the CGI-58 protein. CGI-58 is a coactivator of ATGL, and together these proteins sustain blood lipid levels between meals.Yamaguchi, Tomohiro; Osumi, Takashi (2009). \\"Chanarin‚ÄìDorfman syndrome: Deficiency in CGI-58, a lipid droplet-bound coactivator of lipase\\". Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids. 1791 (6): 519‚Äì523. doi:10.1016/j.bbalip.2008.10.012. ISSN 1388-1981. Disruption of CGI-58 gives rise to the symptoms of ichthyosis, a dermatological condition in which skin becomes very scaly, thick and dry. Ichthyosis is an inherited disorder, like NLSD, and has been found to be genetically linked in some situations with the PNPLA2 gene. Therefore, sometimes when there is a mutation in the PNPLA2 gene, the linked allele of CG-58 is mutated as well. This specific gene, however, does not produce ichthyosis on its own. Ichthyosis can be diagnosed individually in a patient and the genetic cause for unlinked icthyosis is different from the gene linked with PNPLA2. Keep in mind these disorders may occur individually within a patient as well. Pathophysiology The functional changes that occur with this disease are mostly metabolic. Accumulation of triglycerides in the body without an efficient mode for catabolism is thought to lead to the eventual symptoms of this disease. Upon digestion and absorption of fat by the small intestine, triglycerides are combined with vitamins and cholesterol to form chylomicrons. Chylomicrons travel from the intestine into the lymph system before entering the bloodstream. Enzymatic catalysis of chylomicrons by lipases in the bloodstream enables the uptake of lipids and fatty acids by cells. In individuals with NLSD, their triglycerides are not catabolized in the blood, and cells accumulate partially processed lipid droplets over time, which may lead to dysfunction in absorbing tissues. In affected individuals, muscle cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes appear to be prone to the excessive accumulation of triglycerides as lipid droplets. Excessive accumulation of lipids in tissues not designed for long term storage may underlie the clinical manifestations of weakened skeletal and cardiac muscle, fatty liver, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. Diagnosis Main physical signs include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), type 2 diabetes, abnormal levels of creatine kinase in blood, and increased weakness of proximal muscles due to fatty replacement of skeletal muscle fibers. Accurate diagnosis is complicated by symptomatic overlap with other disorders. One of the earliest symptoms to manifest clinically is peripheral limb weakness, which becomes progressively more severe over time.Zhang W, Wen B, Lu J, Zhao Y, Hong D, Zhao Z, Zhang C,i Luo Y, Qi X, Zhang Y, Song X, Zhao Y, Zhao C, Hu J, Yang H, Wang Z, Yan C, and Yuan Y.

Classically, NLSD is associated with myopathy and can, in some cases, be linked with icthyosis. Therefore, with these symptoms or diagnosis, it is likely that the patient could and would be diagnosed with NLSD.Vasiljevski ER, Summers MA, Little DG, Schindeler A.

Although lipid accumulation is most prominent in myocytes, hepatocytes, and granulocytes, other tissues displayed elevated deposits as well. For the purpose of diagnosis, MRIs have been used to identify large fat deposits within muscle tissue.Zhang W, Wen B, Lu J, Zhao Y, Hong D, Zhao Z, Zhang C,i Luo Y, Qi X, Zhang Y, Song X, Zhao Y, Zhao C, Hu J, Yang H, Wang Z, Yan C, and Yuan Y.

People can live with NLSD, but there can be complications due to the affects this disease has on other major parts of the body like the liver, the heart, and skeletal muscle. Whereas myopathy won‚Äôt necessarily show up until a patient is in the third decade of their life,Missaglia S, Coleman RA, Mordente A, and Tavian D.

Also, the earlier that NLSD can be detected and symptoms treated, the better quality of life the patient can have. Treatment Although there is no current treatment to correct the abnormal metabolic processes underlying this disease, there are approaches to ameliorate symptoms and decrease the effects of this disease. Because there is an increase of fat storage and a decrease in fat catabolism, low fat diets are recommended for slowing the progression of the disease, including the onset of type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. In addition, diets containing triglycerides composed of short chain fatty acids are more beneficial than TGAs containing long chain fatty acids. Ketone bodies can be rapidly transported, catabolized, and used by many tissues including the brain. Medium-chain fatty acids in an individual‚Äôs diet are rapidly used by the body, limiting storage and therefore alleviating lipid droplet accumulation. Foods with medium-chain fatty acids include dairy, fat and coconut oil. Supplements can also be taken to increase uptake of these fatty acids. Triaheptanoin, a triglyceride containing three seven-carbon chain fatty acids, has also been proposed as a possible dietary supplement.Lafor√™t, Pascal, and Christine Vianey-Saban. \\"Disorders of muscle lipid metabolism: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.\\" Neuromuscular Disorders 20.11 (2010): 693-700 Treatment for the ichthyosis is limited; moisturizers are commonly used to help manage dry, flaky, itchy skin. Epidemiology The rarity and likely under-diagnosis of neutral lipid storage disease prevents an accurate epidemiological estimate of its frequency in human populations.

Brilliant was built in 1932 on City Island, Bronx, by Henry B. Nevins Yard to a design by Olin Stephens of Sparkman & Stephens for Walter Barnum. Brilliant was built as an ocean racing yacht, and on her maiden voyage crossed the Atlantic Ocean in just over 15 days, 1 hour and 23 minutes, a record for a sailing yacht of her size. Brilliant ran from Nantucket Lightship to Bishop Rock Light, England. According to the Sparkman & Stephens blog, Brilliant was designed to a \\"rigorous\\" standard. During World War II, the schooner was acquired by the U.S. Coast Guard and used to patrol the New England coast for enemy submarines. During this time, two machine guns were mounted on Brilliants deck. After the war, Brilliant was purchased by the accomplished sailor Briggs Cunningham, who attempted to increase her speed by outfitting her with a larger rig. The new rig consisted of taller masts, a self-tacking forestaysail, but maintained the gaff rig. During this time, Cunningham also invented what became known as the cunningham, a tie-down for the tack (the lower, forward corner of the mainsail) that allows the sail to maintain a more efficient shape. This makes Brilliant the first boat to have the device, now standard on racing boats of all sizes. Despite his modifications, Cunningham was unable to significantly improve the Brilliants speed and he donated her to Mystic Seaport in 1953. The seaport once again changed her rig. They maintained the larger rig that Cunningham installed but changed the gaff mainsail to a Bermuda/Marconi rigged main. This is said to have happened to make sailing her easier under her new mission. Mystic Seaport now uses her as an offshore classroom and features her as part of their collection of watercraft. This use was a requirement of Cunningham's gift to Mystic Seaport.

It entered into force on 5 May 2013.OP-ICESCR, Article 18. Genesis In 1966, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Covenant obliged its parties to recognise and progressively implement economic, social, and cultural rights, including labour rights and right to health, right to education, and right to an adequate standard of living, but did not include any mechanism by which these obligations could be legally enforced. Work on an individual complaints mechanism began in 1990, with a view to developing an Optional Protocol similar to those of other UN human rights instruments. Development was encouraged by the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, which recommended the Commission on Human Rights and CESCR to \\"continue examination of optional protocols\\" to the ICESCR. CESCR presented the first draft Optional Protocol in 1997. In 2002, the Committee established an open-ended working group to continue development. In 2006, the Human Rights Council gave the open-ended working group the task of formally negotiating a draft text. Negotiations were completed in April 2008, and the resulting Optional Protocol was formally adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008. It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009. Summary The Optional Protocol establishes an individual complaints mechanism for the Covenant similar to those of the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

From the test report: MISTY PICTURE was the fourth test in the MISTY CASTLE series of large-scale High Explosive (HE) tests sponsored by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). The test was run on 14 May 1987. The explosive consisted of 4685 tons of an Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (ANFO) mixture loaded in bulk into a 44-foot radius fiberglass hemisphere. This is equivalent to 3900 tons of TNT. Detonation of this charge provided an airblast and ground motion environment which was used by numerous agencies to collect basic explosive environmental data and to test a variety of systems and equipment in a simulated nuclear environment. The resulting overpressure from the detonation simulated the approximate equivalent airblast of an 8 kiloton nuclear device. Objective Construction of the fiberglass dome to be filled with explosives for the Misty Picture test From the introduction to the test report: > MISTY PICTURE was sponsored by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA), with Field > Command. DNA (FCDNA) being tasked with executing the event. The primary > objective of the test is to provide an airblast and ground shock environment > for DoD-sponsored experiments.

Event description The test was conducted at the Permanent High Explosive Test Site (PHETS) on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), approximately south of the Northern Range boundary. Ground Zero (GZ) was approximately south- southeast from the GZ used for the very similar June 1985 Minor Scale event.

She was the sister ship to MS Giulio Cesare that was launched in the same year. These two ships were built to the same design, with similar specifications. After the Augustus was sold to Hong Kong, she sailed under five names. The ship was later sold to Manila Hotel and renamed MS Philippines, functioning as a static hotel. As reported by both Maritimematters, and ssmaritime, the MS Philippines, was sold for scrap in September 2011. As of December 2011, she was beached in Alang for scrapping. Concept and construction After the end of World War II, the Italian Line lost many of their fleet including their two super liners, SS Rex and SS Conte di Savoia, so they planned to build two 27,000 GRT ocean liners for post war service to replace them. Giulio Cesare and Augustus were impression of power and beauty with fat and round bows, curved superstructures, modern masts, enormous funnel, and graceful sterns. Her external beauty restrained to the most canvassing standards with pleasingly sculptured bridge wings, an evocative nape at the aft funnel base, and even a trademark ventilator aft of the funnel that earned nicknamed the \\"robot\\" for its extraordinary shape. These two ships were one of the Italian post war ships. The ship had twin 12-cylinder Fiat diesel engines, generating 24,000 base horsepower (bhp) that drove her twin screws at a service speed of 21 knots. Both ships were designed to sail on the Italy-South America route, run with three classes. Both ships' interior were designed to have full air conditioning and swimming pools for each of three classes to make the ships looked like a luxurious hotel and to be the symbol of modern technology. Service history =Italian Line service= The Augustus was launched on November 9, 1950 at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico, San Marco shipyard near Trieste, by Francesca De Gasperi (the wife of the Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi). On March 4, 1952, she sailed from Genoa to South America on her maiden voyage. She was put in a normal route from Genoa, calling at Naples, Cannes, Barcelona (or Lisbon), Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo, to Buenos Aires. Following the loss of the SS Andrea Doria in 1956, she was put into the North Atlantic service in February 1957 before returning to her usual Genoa-South America route in 1960 after the new SS Leonardo da Vinci was in service on the North Atlantic route. She and her sister were converted to two classes, which the cabin class was removed. Like her sister, the ship was given a refit; however, these two ships were given a similar addition, which made them still look the same as each other. =Interior and exterior of Augustus= The Augustus had the following nine passenger decks (arrange from beneath the top of the house): Sun Deck, Lido Deck, Boat Deck, Promenade Deck, Upper Deck, Foyer Deck, A Deck, B Deck, and C Deck. Sun Deck, which started off from the wheelhouse, chartroom, radio room, following along either side of aft, encircling the funnel casing, kennels, and the \\"robot\\" ventilator, was first class's facility. Lido Deck started off from a narrow full-wrap around promenade and officers' quarters, culminating aft with a bar, the first class pool, and changing rooms. Boat Deck started off forward with another narrow promenade, opening into wider expansion beneath a canopy of lifeboats and davits along either side. Inwardly, this level started off with the first class Belvedere Observation Lounge that was equipped with a panorama of windows overlooking the ship's bow. A reading room was continuing aft on the starboard side. This space's amidships was the first class writing room. The forward staircase's highest level was just aft with its burled panels and magnificent modern glass railings. Also, there was an elevator, linking the first class decks in this part of the ship. The deluxe suite facility started along port and aft passageways, to a small gymnasium, playroom, solarium, and message room on the starboard side. The aft part of Boat Deck, which had its own pool, lido and bar, was cabin class's facility. Promenade Deck started forward with a first class observation area, then number three-like encompassing, continuing aft through narrow links to the glass-enveloped first class promenade. Inwardly, it started with the phenomenal social hall with its curved panorama of windows and an aft bulkhead that held sculptures and reliefs in bronze by Mascherini. In this sheered salon, the ceiling accommodated an oval recess in which the lighting was designed in a zodiac fashion. This room was converted into an auditorium in 1964. The only part of this social hall to be carried over into the auditorium was an oval ceiling recess constellation-like lighting arrangement. The forward staircase lobby continued aft with foyer starting off on either side to the passageways and promenades which brought aft to the first class ballroom. The staircase itself, was decorated with Mascherini's sculptures. =Hong Kong and Philippines service= The Augustus was retired from service in January 1976. On January 15, 1976, she was laid up in Naples. She was sold to Hong Kong and was renamed Great Sea. After a little use, she was renamed Ocean King in 1980. And in 1983, she was renamed Philippines. At that time, she served as an accommodation ship in Manila. She was renamed President in 1985. However, she was laid up in Kaohsiung, and in 1987, she was renamed Asian Princess and in 1997, she was moved to Subic Bay, where she was converted into cruising. However, the ship has failed in making money in this venture. Then she was moved and place at anchorage off Manila. She was dry-docked at Subic Bay in mid-1998, and in February 1999, she returned to Manila, where she was refitted for use as a floating hotel and restaurant venue as originally planned. The ship was berthed at Pier 15 South Harbour Manila on October 2, 1999 after she was acquired by the Manila Hotel. On the October 12, 1999 in a gala ceremony attended by President Estrada, the ship was renamed MS Philippines. She was opened to the public, and in early 2000, the ship was opened as a hotel but due to the political disruption, the hotel was eventually closed. Shortly after, she was reopened for an onshore hotel. However, she was laid up for sale; Italian buyers expressed interest in purchasing her but no sale was ever closed, and the vessel was sold for scrapping. During the months of January 2012 through October 2012, the \\"Philippines\\" was cut up by scrappers in Alang, India, and now there is nothing left recognizable of the former \\"Augustus\\" The Philippines laid up in 240px  References  Passenger ships of Italy Ocean liners 1950 ships Ships built by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico Ships built in Trieste Cultural depictions of Augustus ","title":"MS Augustus (1950)"},{"id":"20673454","text":"Helen Keaney (also sometimes credited as Helen Rosenthal) is an American actress, comedian, and hostess on HSN (Home Shopping Network).HSN: Helen Keaney She was a cast member of \\"3 Blonde Moms\\"http://www.3blondemoms.com/page2.html Previously she did national television commercials for various products including Clorox, Tylenol, Gateway, Degree Deodorant, Dr. Scholl's, Starkist, Thermacare and Verizon.

Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal.2d 453, 150 P.2d 436 (1944), was a decision of the Supreme Court of California involving an injury caused by an exploding bottle of Coca-Cola. It was an important case in the development of the common law of product liability in the United States, not so much for the actual majority opinion, but for the concurring opinion of California Supreme Court justice Roger Traynor. Background Plaintiff Gladys Escola was a waitress in a restaurant. She was putting away glass bottles of Coca-Cola when one of the bottles spontaneously exploded in her hand. She suffered a deep five-inch cut, which severed the blood vessels, nerves, and muscles of the thumb and palm of the hand. The top portion of the bottle, with the cap, remained in her hand, and the lower portion fell to the floor but did not break. The broken bottle was not produced at the trial, as the pieces had been thrown away by an employee of the restaurant shortly after the accident. Escola, however, described the broken pieces, and a diagram of the bottle was made showing the location of the \\"fracture line,\\" where the bottle broke in two. One of Coca-Cola's delivery drivers was called as a witness by plaintiff, and he testified that he had seen other bottles of Coca-Cola in the past explode and had found broken bottles in the warehouse when he took the cases out but that he did not know what made them blow up. Escola was represented at trial by legendary litigator Melvin Belli, then in the early stage of his career. He later acknowledged in his own autobiography that he did not then fully comprehend that her case would become a far-reaching landmark case. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, following the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Majority opinion Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson affirmed the judgment of the lower court. He held that even though the instrument causing the injury was not under the exclusive control of the defendant at the time of the accident, the defendant had control at the time the alleged negligent act took place (the filling of the defective bottle). > Upon an examination of the record, the evidence appears sufficient to > support a reasonable inference that the bottle here involved was not damaged > by any extraneous force after delivery to the restaurant by defendant. It > follows, therefore, that the bottle was in some manner defective at the time > defendant relinquished control, because sound and properly prepared bottles > of carbonated liquids do not ordinarily explode when carefully handled. > [Escola, 24 Cal.2d at 459] Furthermore, even though the defendant produced evidence to rebut the inference of negligence that arises upon application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur by discussing its safety testing procedures, Gibson ruled that the question was properly submitted to the jury and did not modify the jury's verdict. Concurring opinion Justice Roger Traynor concurred in the judgment but argued that instead of deciding the case on grounds of negligence, a rule of strict liability should be imposed on manufacturers whose products cause injury to consumers. Basing his reasoning heavily on earlier cases (especially MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.), Traynor argued that public policy demanded \\"that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market.\\" He felt that manufacturers were better prepared to handle the costs of injury than individual consumers, and he noted that California state law already applied a rule of strict liability to makers of foodstuffs that cause illness or injury. Traynor also felt that the majority's reasoning approached a rule of strict liability even though the decision was ostensibly based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur: > In leaving it to the jury to decide whether the inference has been > dispelled, regardless of the evidence against it, the negligence rule > approaches the rule of strict liability. It is needlessly circuitous to make > negligence the basis of recovery and impose what is in reality liability > without negligence. If public policy demands that a manufacturer of goods be > responsible for their quality regardless of negligence there is no reason > not to fix that responsibility openly. 24 Cal.2d at 463. Traynor also wrote that the nature of the modern system of the mass production and distribution of goods made it difficult or impossible for consumers to inspect and verify that the products they were purchasing were safe or to demonstrate that the manufacturer had been negligent. That made strict liability a more practical standard. Legacy Today, Escola is widely recognized as a landmark case in American law and is mandatory reading for first-year students in most American law schools. The reason is that in 1963, Traynor wrote a majority opinion, Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, 59 Cal. 2d 57 (1963), in which the Court at last adopted the rule he had suggested 19 years earlier. In Greenman, Traynor wrote: \\"We need not recanvass the reasons for imposing strict liability on the manufacturer. They have been fully articulated in the cases cited.\\" Of course, among those cases was his own concurrence in Escola. Because Traynor incorporated by reference his own discussion in Escola, the two cases are usually assigned and discussed together.

It is contained within sections of Baldwin, Clarke, Mobile, Monroe, and Washington counties.South Alabama Regional Planning Commission Environment and ecology The Mobile‚ÄìTensaw delta is ecologically important and includes a wide variety of habitats, including mesic flood plains, cypress-gum swamps, tidal brackish water marshes, bottomland forests and submersed grass beds. As one of the most biologically diverse regions in both Alabama and the United States, it is home to 126 species of fish, 46 mammals, 69 reptiles, 30 amphibians, and at least 300 species of bird, including more than 110 which nest in the region. The delta's considerable biodiversity has led to it being described as an \\"American Amazon\\" by naturalist E. O. Wilson.https://eowilsonfoundation.org/celebrating-mobile-delta-biodiversity/ Natural history The delta lies in a river valley which began forming several million years ago. Many separate inland streams joined as they flowed southward across land which was once covered by the Gulf of Mexico. By the end of the last major ice age (approximately 18,000 years ago), when the sea level was much lower and Alabama's coastline was about south of its present location, the waterways of the delta valley extended much farther than their current-day southern termination at the head of Mobile Bay. As the ice age ended and global temperatures increased, sea levels began to rise again to their present-day level.\\"Mobile‚ÄìTensa Delta\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama History Humans inhabited the delta region at least as far back as 5,000 years ago. During the Mississippian periodically time, people of the Pensacola culture built earthen mounds along Bottle Creek and the Tensaw River. During the late prehistoric period, other peoples moved into the area, including the Taensas (Tensaw), the Creek, and the Choctaw. In the 16th century, the area was visited by Spanish forces. French explorers arrived in the last years of the 17th century, eventually settling colonial Mobile in 1702 at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River. During the Creek War, Red Stick Creeks attacked Fort Mims near the confluence of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers in August 1813, where they killed most of the mixed-blood Tensaw and Lower Town Creeks, intermarried whites, slaves, and nearly 275 militia. The schooner Clotilda arrived in the Delta on July 7, 1860, carrying 103 enslaved West Africans captured in Dahomey, and was scuttled to prevent being prosecuted under the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. It was the last slave ship to enter the United States via the Atlantic slave trade. After the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment, many of the descendants of the Clotilda would establish the neighborhood of Africatown in Mobile. The last important battle of the American Civil War took place at the fortified town of Blakeley, located on the edge of the delta. A railroad line to connect Mobile to Montgomery, now part of the CSX system, opened across the delta in 1872.The Louisville and Nashville Railroad 1850-1963, Kincaid A. Herr, 2009 paperback ed., p. 58. In the mid-1920s, the Causeway was built across the lowest part of the delta, connecting the western and eastern shores of Mobile Bay.

The work is one aspect of the major wave of Utopian (and dystopian) literature that characterized the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the English-speaking world, that literature is best known in its AmericanJean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1974.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976. and BritishMatthew Beaumont, Utopian Ltd.: Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England 1870-1900, Leiden, Brill Academic Publishers, 2005. expressions; but The Great Romance illustrates how that wave of utopian fiction reached into the remoter regions of the Anglophone domain. An 1882 article in the Christchurch newspaper The StarThe Star, 5 January 1882 p.3 identifies the author as \\"Mr Henry Honor, a gentleman resident in Ashburton\\". A review of both parts of the book appeared in the Dunedin Otago Daily Times in 1882.Dunedin Otago Daily Times, 18 February 1882 p.1 Literary connections In The Great Romance, the protagonist endures a long sleep and awakes in the future. He meets and falls in love with a young woman named Edith, a descendant of an important figure in his earlier life, who then serves as a guide for the protagonist in the new world he confronts. These elements unite The Great Romance with Bellamy's famous book. A third novel of the period, John Macnie's The Diothas, may have served as a conduit for the common features shared by the Inhabitant's and Bellamy's fictions; all three share these commonalities, and Macnie's book has a New Zealand connection that Bellamy's lacks. Yet it is also possible that Bellamy drew upon The Great Romance directly rather than through any intermediary work: editor Dominic Alessio has argued that Bellamy's later short story \\"To Whom This May Come\\"Edward Bellamy, \\"To Whom This May Come,\\" in: The Blindman's World and Other Stories, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1898; pp. 389-415. shows a \\"pervasive\\" influence of the Inhabitant's work on the shared theme of telepathic communication.  Synopsis  The book's opening scene portrays the protagonist, John Hope, awakening from a sleep of 193 years. Hope had been a prominent mid-twentieth-century scientist, who had developed new power sources that enabled air travel and, eventually, space exploration. In the year 1950, Hope had taken a \\"sleeping draught\\" that put him into a long suspended animation, as part of a planned experiment. When he wakes in the year 2143, he is met by Alfred and Edith Weir, descendants of John Malcolm Weir, the chemist who had prepared the sleeping draft Hope had taken in 1950. Hope is shocked to find that the Weirs and their contemporaries have telepathic abilities. The development of telepathy as a general human talent has led to a vastly improved society. People can no longer conceal malevolent motives and plans, a fact that has inaugurated a new moral order. Those who have been unable or unwilling to adapt to this new social and ethical climate have left civilized society for more primitive lands, where the telepathic power is not dominant. Hope joins with Alfred Weir and another scientist, Charles Moxton, in a plan to fly a specially-equipped craft to the planet Venus. Moxton has developed his paranormal abilities to include telekinesis. The later chapters of the book describe their flight to Venus, and what they find on that planet. The Great Romance makes a special effort to attempt a realistic forecast of what space travel would be like, in terms of the absence of breathable atmosphere and gravity in space, and comparable factors. In these aspects, the book reflects the likely influence of Percy Greg's 1880 novel Across the Zodiac. New editions The original edition of The Great Romance is one of the rarest books extant, with single copies of Parts 1 and 2 existing in New Zealand libraries. After a century of neglect, the book has been reprinted by editor Dominic Alessio, first in Science Fiction Studies in 1993 (Part 1) and then in a separate volume in 2008 (Parts 1 and 2).The Inhabitant, The Great Romance, Dominic Alessio, ed., Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 2008.

This meant that the rest of Canada's HR associations had to either accept the HRPA's three-tiered model themselves or retain the nationally recognized CHRP designation under a different name.http://www.hria.ca/changes-chrp-designation-and-hr-industry- across-canada Established in 1994, the Chartered Professionals in Human Resources Canada is a collaborative effort of human resources associations in nationally, formerly known as Canadian Council of Human Resources Associations (CCHRA).

He is one of the earliest writers to have written in both Arabic and a Latin language (Catalan). He became a vizier in Hafsid Tunis where he died in 1423 during the reign of Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II.  Life  Turmeda wrote that he studied and lived in Lleida. When approximately 35, he traveled to Sicily and stayed there for five months, after which he sailed to Tunis during the reign of Abu al-Abbas Ahmad II (r. 1370‚Äî1394), where he stayed with some Christian clergymen and traders for four months, during which time he asked to be connected to a Muslim who knows the \\"language of the Chrisitians\\", and was introduced to the court physician Yusuf, and announced to him that the reason he came to this land was because he intended to convert to Islam. Yusuf then introduced him to the Hafsid ruler, who inquired about his motives and authorized him to convert and offered him a salaried position. Works *Llibre dels bons amonestaments Turmeda dates it to April 1398, eleven years after his settlement in Tunis. It consists of 428 poems arranged in three rhyming stanzas followed by a rhyme-free one. Its preface says it was \\"composed in Tunis by monk Anselm Turmeda, also called Abdal√†\\". The work was very popular in Catalonia, being called franselm (from \\"fra [i.e. friar] Anselm\\"). *Disputa de l'ase Written in 1417 in Catalan, no part survived in its original language. Current Catalan editions are available based on a medieval French translation. The Inquisition put it on the Index of prohibited books in 1583, contributing to its disappearance. Both for political and religious reasons, it did not square with the orthodoxy of Catholic Spain in the 16th century. It presents a dispute among a donkey and a friar, arguing about the supremacy of men over animals, each one defending their genre. Finally, men win because Christ was incarnated in a man. The work is, however, very critical towards mankind, in all the aspects: religious, moral, political, etc. *Llibre de tres This book wants to instruct in an amusing way. *Tuhfat al-Arib fi al-Radd 'ala ahl al-Salib [English: The Gift to the Intelligent for Refuting the Arguments of the Christians] (1420) The best known of his Arabic books, it is a polemical work against Christianity and affirming the prophethood of the messenger of Allah Muhammad.

The site is in the present-day Rural Municipality of Alonsa. Trading post The first trading post at or near the Manitoba House site was operated for one season, 1797-98,by a Hudson's Bay Company servant, John Best, somewhere near the Lake Manitoba Narrows. The name in the post journal, Doubtful Post, was likely chosen because of a lack of confidence in the survival of the post [Hudson's Bay Company Archives, B.53/a/1]. This post was indeed abandoned after this season, and the Company had no permanent presence in the district for many years. Manitoba House, which was intended to serve a large area, between Riding Mountain and Lake Winnipeg, was established on the west side of Lake Manitoba, about 15 miles south of the Narrows, in the 1820s. Treaty 2 was signed on August 21, 1871, at Manitoba House. A number of notable individuals served at Manitoba House, including Isaac Cowie, as fur trader, and Archibald McDonald, as clerk. Settlement The Metis settlement adjacent to the trading post was referred to as simply the Manitoba House Settlement until 1889 when the name Kinosota was suggested by John Norquay for the local post office. The settlement consists of a number of long narrow lots strung out along the shore of Lake Manitoba. St. Bede's Anglican parish, located in Kinosota, was formed in 1842 by Reverend Abraham Cowley, and is one of the oldest Anglican parishes in Manitoba.

The property contains twelve historically significant structures dating from 1818 to the 1880s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1977, due to its association with Joseph Wheeler. History The plantation at Pond Spring was first established by the John P. Hickman family in 1818. They were among the earliest settlers of Lawrence County. By 1820 Hickman's family had grown to 11 members and he owned 56 slaves. Benjamin Sherrod, a planter from Halifax County, North Carolina with more than 300 slaves, bought Pond Spring and its from Hickman in 1827. In the 1830s his son, Felix Sherrod, greatly expanded the larger of the two log dogtrot cabins on the property into what today is known as the Sherrod House. It is a vernacular interpretation of the Federal style. The smaller dogtrot came to be used as housing for slaves. Upon Felix's death the plantation was inherited by his son, also named Benjamin. Benjamin Sherrod married Daniella Jones from the nearby Caledonia plantation in 1859, but he died prematurely in 1861. Daniella Sherrod met Joseph Wheeler, a general in the Confederate States Army from Augusta, Georgia, during his visit to the area in 1863. They married following the American Civil War and lived in New Orleans for the next four years. They returned to Lawrence County in the early 1870s and built a new home, adjacent to the older Sherrod House. Beginning in 1880, Wheeler served multiple terms as a United States Representative from Alabama until he retired from politics in 1900. In 1898, Wheeler volunteered for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and received an appointment to major general of volunteers by President William McKinley. He assumed command of the cavalry division, which included Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Wheeler next served in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in 1899. He commanded the First Brigade in Arthur MacArthur's Second Division during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War until January 1900. During this period, Wheeler was mustered out of the volunteer service and commissioned a brigadier general in the regular army, both on June 16, 1900. He retired on September 10, 1900 and moved to New York City, where he died in 1906. His daughter, Annie, lived on the plantation until her death in 1955. It remained in the Wheeler family until 1993, when it was donated by them to the state of Alabama and the Alabama Historical Commission.  Visiting  The property is managed by the Alabama Historical Commission. AHC has completed restoring the Wheeler House, which is now open to the public.

Its species name labiatus comes from the Latin labium, meaning \\"lip\\", referring to a distinctive three-lobed structure on its lower lips. S. labiatus is only known from the Tef√© River, at a depth of , and from the lower Rio Negro, in the Amazon River basin. They have been captured from both whitewater and blackwater habitats. S. labiatus has a laterally compressed, knife-shaped body with a nearly straight dorsal profile and a long anal fin. The head is laterally compressed, with a curved dorsal profile and small eyes that are covered by a thin membrane. The mouth is terminal, with a three-lobed rigid structure consisting of a pair of smooth, hard, bulbous swellings along the lower lip and a medial spur that projects down and forward. The lower jaw is longer than deep, bearing two rows of conical teeth numbering 17 plus 4 replacements each. There are upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates with 5-6 and 8-9 teeth respectively. There is no sexual dimorphism in the cranium or the three-lobed structure. The pectoral fins are broad and pointed, with 12-14 rays. The anal fin rays number 156-168. The tail is compressed and moderately long, with a small lanceolate caudal fin containing 15-16 rays. The coloration is dark brown, becoming darker on the back and head. Brown chromatophores are lightly speckled on the pterygiophores (supporting bones) of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are hyaline with dark tips, the anal fin is hyaline with a scattering of light brown chromatophores and a slightly darkened margin, and the caudal fin is very dark brown to black. S. labiatus grows to about . The structure on the lower lip of S. labiatus has been speculated to function in electroreception for locating prey. Like other apteronotids, these fish generate a continuous weak electric field for the purposes of electrolocation and communication. The electric organ discharge (EOD) of S. labiatus has a fundamental frequency of 1160-1587 Hz and two phases; there is no known sexual dimorphism in waveform or frequency. Reproduction is believed to occur after the onset of the rising water period in October.

The detailed design for the road was developed in 1932 by the National Park Service Branch of Engineering and Branch of Plans and Design for maximum scenic impact, using the National Park Service Rustic style. Most of the road was constructed with almost entirely manual labor by labor from the Works Progress Administration, Public Works Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps, and represents one of the most significant Depression-era public projects. Extensive drilling and blasting was required, and three tunnels were bored. Work was suspended by the Second World War from 1942 to 1948, and was finally completed in 1950.

He was the second Jewish justice of the court, after Henry A. Lyons, but was the first elected by direct vote of the people. Biography In 1816, Heydenfeldt was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He read law in the offices of William F. De Saussure, a son of the noted Chancellor Henry William de Saussure. In 1837, at 21 years of age, Heydenfeldt moved to Russell County and Tallapoosa County, Alabama. There, he was admitted to the state bar, practiced law, and in 1841 served as a judge.Heydenfeldt v. Townes, 27 Ala. 56 (1855)(\\"The order appointing an administrator, made in November 1841, is signed by S. Heydenfeldt as judge\\"). In 1850, he moved to California and was admitted to the bar. In 1851, his brother, Elcan Heydenfeldt, served as President pro tempore of the California State Senate, and Solomon unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination to the United States Senate. In October 1851, he ran against Whig Party candidate, Tod Robinson, to fill the seat of Serranus Clinton Hastings, and won a six year term. Heydenfeldt's notable opinions include Irwin v. Phillips,Irwin v. Phillips, 5 Cal. 140 (1855). which established the doctrine of prior appropriation in western water law jurisprudence. In March 1852, he returned to Alabama to visit his family, and his absence from the state led to a court opinion on whether his seat was \\"vacant\\".People v. Wells, 2 Cal. 198 (1852). On January 6, 1857, he stepped down from the bench, and joined Vermont-born brothers Oscar L. Shafter and James McMillan Shafter in forming the law firm of Shafter, Shafter, Park and Heydenfeldt, along with Trevor Park, in San Francisco. While in private practice, Heydenfeldt argued before the California Supreme Court in Ex Parte Newman (1858),Ex Parte Newman, 9 Cal. 502 (1858). where he successfully defended a Jewish man's right to work on Sunday. In 1862, during the Civil War, he refused on principle to take a test oath for lawyers of loyalty to the Union cause (as did Virginia-born James D. Thornton), which led to his semi-retirement from the Bar. Civic activities Heydenfeldt helped found the first free kindergarten in San Francisco, along with New York professor Felix Adler. Personal life He married twice: first, in Alabama, to Catherine Heydenfeldt, who died July 3, 1887, and then, in California, to Elisabeth A. Heydenfeldt, who survived him.In re Heydenfeldt, 106 Cal. 434 (1895). He had ten children.

Demographics India census, Muttuchira had a population of 14303 with 7022 males and 7281 females. It is a calm and quiet farming village with rubber & coconut plantations and paddy fields with hilly and narrow plain landscape where Christians and Hindus live in religious harmony. Occupations of the most people are either farming or service. In ancient records, Muttuchira was recorded as Nayappilli. Muttuchira got its name from a small check dam(chira) constructed in earlier times to irrigate paddy fields. It currently has amenities like Hospital(muttuchira holy ghost mission hospital), Bank, ATM, Village office, Post office, Churches(holy ghost church), Temples (Kunnasheri Kave, Trikke),Govt Poly technic, Nursing school, Girls high School,Boys High School, LP & UP schools, Govt. Ayurveda dispensary and market. Kaduthuruthy Railway Halt is in the village. The village is part of Kaduthuruthy Gram Panchayat and Kaduthuruthy Assembly constituency.Saint Alphonsa of India was brought up in this village. The majority population are Syro-Malabar Catholics and some protestant Christians, but many Hindus also live in Muttuchira harmoniously. Holy Ghost Forane church, Muttuchira Muttuchira Pally is one of the oldest churches in India. There is an ancient Pahlavi inscribed granite bas relief Cross found in Muttuchira. According to the local tradition, The Church at Muttuchira was founded in AD 510. It was probably located near the ancient open air rock cross at Kurisum-moodu, a little east of the present church dedicated to Mar Sleeba (syriac:sliba meaning Holy Cross). It is probable that a new Church was built in the present Church compound on the Eastern side in AD 1528 by Mar Denha and Mar Abo ( Mar Jacob Abuna) as narrated on the Muttuchita inscriptions. This Church was dedicated to Ruha D Kudisha- Holy Spirit. The Pahlavi inscribed granite Cross was transferred to this Church from the ancient Mar Sliba Church. Later, this sliba which was placed in the altar was covered by building a wooden raredos rathaal in front of it. In AD 1854-58 period, another Church was built in front the old Church dedicated to Ruha D Kudisha which is the main Church at Muttuchira today. In AD 1923, the old Rooha D Kudhisha Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane Church, Muttuchira on the eastern side of the present Church was renovated to rededicate it to Saint Francis of Assissi. During the renovations, the ancient Pahlavi inscribed Granite Sliva was rediscovered behind the wooden raredos- rathaal of the old church fixed to the eastern wall of the Madbaha. It was again neglected and transferred to the new Ruha D' Qudisha Church in a very unimportant place- back side of the wall of the facade in a corner, probably because of the interests of the Archaeological Department of the then Government of Travancore. Now, this invaluable monument of Saint Thomas Christians of Malabar has been placed in a side altar of the main Church. Muttuchira inscriptions Muttuchira inscriptions are early Malayalam inscriptions- Vattezhuthu- Nanam Monum- on a granite tablet found in Muttuchira. The 'Muttuchira inscriptions' are inscriptions narrating about the installation of the free standing Cross and the Pahlavi inscribed bas relief cross-The 'Muttuchira Sliba'. The inscriptions are on a rectangular granite slab in two sections divided by a vertical line in between. According to Mr T K Joseph, this inscription must be of AD 1581 or later. This tablet has been the subject of extensive research by many scholars. This granite slab was found on the western wall of the ground floor room of the two storey building attached to the northern side of the old Church of the Holy Ghost. The upper story was used as the Priest's Home and the ground floor was used as the sacristy. Muttuchira Sliba, the Pahlavi inscribed Cross is an invaluable monument of the Christian community that was the symbol of veneration of the ancient Christian settlement of Muttuchira. Muttuchira inscription tablet is another landmark monument which narrates installation of the Mar Thoma Sliva in the altar and the open air Rock Cross of Muttuchira Church is historically important.

The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages. Gwynedd is located in the north of Wales. Distinctive achievements in Gwynedd during this period include further development of Medieval Welsh literature, for instance in the poetry of those of the Beirdd y Tywysogion (Welsh for Poets of the Princes) associated with the court of Gwynedd, the reformation of bardic schools, and the continued development of Cyfraith Hywel (The Law of Hywel, or Welsh law); all three of which further contributed to the development of a Welsh national identity in the face of Anglo-Norman encroachment of Wales and the threat of conquest by the Crown of England. Gwynedd's traditional territory included Anglesey (Ynys M√¥n) and all of north Wales between the River Dyfi in the south and River Dee (Welsh Dyfrdwy) in the northeast.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, foundations of pgs 50‚Äì51, 54‚Äì55 The Irish Sea lies to the north and west, and lands formerly part of the Powys border the south-east. Gwynedd's strength was due in part to the region's mountainous geography which made it difficult for foreign invaders to campaign in the country and impose their will effectively.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Recovers Gwynedd, Norman invasion, Battle of Anglesey Sound, pgs 21‚Äì22, 36, 39, 40, later years 76‚Äì77 Gwynedd emerged from the Early Middle Ages having suffered from increasing Viking raids and various occupations by rival Welsh princes, causing political and social upheaval. With the historic Aberffraw family displaced, by the mid 11th century Gwynedd was united with the rest of Wales by the conquest of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, followed by the Norman invasions between 1067 and 1100. After the restoration of the Aberffraw family in Gwynedd, a series of successful rulers such as Gruffudd ap Cynan and Owain Gwynedd in the late 11th and 12th centuries, and Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in the 13th century, led to the emergence of the Principality of Wales, based on Gwynedd. The emergence of the principality in the 13th century showed that all the elements necessary for the growth of Welsh statehood were in place, and that Wales was independent de facto, according to historian Dr John Davies.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, emerging defacto statehood pg 148 As part of the Principality of Wales, Gwynedd retained Welsh laws and customs and home rule until the Edwardian Conquest of Wales of 1282. Settlements, architecture, and economy When Gruffudd ap Cynan died in 1137 he left a more stable realm than had existed in Gwynedd for more than 100 years.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Gruffyd's legacy pg 79, 80 No foreign army was able to cross the Conwy into upper Gwynedd. The stability in upper Gwynedd provided by Gruffudd and his son Owain Gwynedd, between 1101 and 1170, allowed Gwynedd's inhabitants to plan for the future without fear that home and harvest would \\"go to the flames\\" from invaders. Settlements in Gwynedd became more permanent, with buildings of stone replacing timber structures. Stone churches in particular were built across Gwynedd, with so many limewashed that \\"Gwynedd was bespangled with them as is the firmament with stars\\". Gruffudd had built stone churches at his princely manors, and Lloyd suggests that his example led to the rebuilding of churches in stone in Penmon, Aberdaron, and Towyn in the Norman fashion. By the 13th century, Gwynedd was the cornerstone of the Principality of Wales (that is Pura Wallia), which came to encompass three- quarters of the area of modern Wales: \\"from Anglesey to Machen, from the outskirts of Chester to the outskirts of Cydweli\\".Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Aberffraw stability and effects on population, town- dwellers, decline in slavery, page 151Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Aberffraw stability pg 219, 220 By 1271, Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd could claim a growing population of about 200,000: a little less than three-quarters of the total Welsh population.The emergence of the principality of Wales Drawing of a falconer from Peniarth 28 manuscript. Wales exported hawks. Population increase was common throughout Europe in the 13th century, but in Wales it was more pronounced. By Llywelyn II's reign as much as 10 per cent of the population were town-dwellers. Additionally, \\"unfree slaves... had long disappeared\\" from within Pura Wallia due in large part form the social upheavals of the 11th century,\\" argued Davies. The increase in free men allowed the prince to call on and field a far more substantial and professional army. The increase in population in Gwynedd, and in the Principality of Wales as a whole, allowed a greater diversification of the economy. The Meirionnydd tax rolls evidence the thirty-seven various professions present in Meirionnydd immediately before the Edwardian Conquest of 1282. Of these professions, there were eight goldsmiths, four professional bards (poets), 26 shoemakers, a doctor in Cynwyd and an hotel keeper in Maentwrog, and 28 priests, two of whom were university graduates. Also present were a significant number of fishermen, administrators and clerics, professional men and craftsmen. With the average temperature of Wales a degree or two higher than it is today, more Welsh lands were arable: \\"a crucial bonus for a country like Wales\\", wrote historian Dr John Davies.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, agriculture pg 150 Important for Gwynedd and Pura Wallia were more developed trade routes, which allowed the introduction of the windmill, the fulling-mill, and the horse collar (which doubled the useful power of the horse). Gwynedd exported cattle, skins, cheese, timber, horses, wax, dogs, hawks, and fleeces, and also flannel (with the growth of fulling mills). Flannel was second only to cattle among the principality's exports. In exchange, the principality imported salt, wine, wheat, and other luxuries from London and Paris. But most importantly for its defence, Gwynedd also imported iron and specialised weaponry. England exploited Welsh dependence on foreign imports to wear down Gwynedd and the Principality of Wales in times of conflict between the two countries. Poetry, literature, and music John Martin The more stable social and political environment provided by the Aberffraw administration allowed the natural development of Welsh culture, particularly in literature. Tradition originating from The History of Gruffudd ap Cynan attributes Gruffudd I as reforming the orders of bards and musicians. Welsh literature of the High Middle Ages demonstrated \\"vigour and a sense of commitment\\" as new ideas reached Wales, even in \\"the wake of the invaders\\", according to historian John Davies.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Aberffraw primacy pg 220 Additionally, contacts with continental Europe \\"sharpened Welsh pride\\", argues Davies.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Aberffraw primacy pg 116, patron of bards 117, Aberfraw relations with English crown pg 128, 135 In Welsh the poets of this period are known as Beirdd y Tywysogion (Poets of the Princes) or Y Gogynfeirdd (The Less Early Poets). The main source for the poetry of the 12th and 13th centuries is the Hendregadredd manuscript, an anthology of court poetry brought together at the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey from about 1282 until 1350. The bards of this period were schooled professionals and members of a guild of poets, a kind of bardic guild whose rights and responsibilities were enshrined in native Welsh law. Members of this guild worked within a developed literary culture and with prescribed literary and oral syntax. Bardic families were common‚Äîthe poet Meilyr Brydydd had a poet son and at least two poet grandsons‚Äîbut it was also usual for the craft of poetry to be taught formally in bardic schools, which might only be run by the pencerdd (chief poet). According to Welsh law, the prince retained the skills of several bards at court, the chief of which were the pencerdd and the bardd teulu. The pencerdd, the head bard, was the top of his profession and a special chair was set aside for him in the princely court in an honoured position next to the heir, the edling. When the pencerdd performed he was expected to sing twice: once in honour of God, and once in honour of the prince. The bardd teulu was part of the prince's teulu, or household guard, and was responsible for singing for the military retinue before going into battle, and also for successful military campaigns. The bardd teulu also composed for and sang to the princess, often privately at her leisure. A private performance by a bard was a sign of high status and prestige. The cl√™r were itinerant poet-musicians, considered the lowest tier of the poetic tradition, and often disparaged by the court poets as mere \\"minstrels\\". The poetry praises the military prowess of the prince in a language that is deliberately antiquarian and obscure, echoing the earlier praise poetry tradition of Taliesin. There are also some religious poems and poetry in praise of women. With the death of the last native prince of Wales in 1282 the tradition gradually disappears. In fact, the elegy by Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch (fl. 1277‚Äì83) on the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd is one of the most notable poems of the era. Other prominent poets of this period associated with the court of Gwynedd include: *Meilyr Brydydd, fl. ca. 1100‚Äì1137; the earliest of the Gogynfeirdd *Llywarch ap Llywelyn, fl. 1174/5-1220,Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest Hywel's succession and overthrow by Cristen and Dafydd, pg 134 Dafydd takes Gwynedd by 1074, pg 135, Gwynedd between 1175‚Äì1188, pg 145 (c. 1195) sang of Llywelyn the Great's victory over Dafydd ab Owain *Bleddyn Fardd, fl. ca. 1258‚Äì1284 *Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr; fl. ca. 1155‚Äì1200 *Dafydd Benfras, fl. ca. 1220‚Äì58 A rather different poet of this period was Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (d. 1170), known as the Poet-Prince. As the son and heir of Prince Owain Gwynedd, he was not a professional poet. The Welsh Church in Gwynedd St. David, the patron saint of Wales. =Celtic Christian traditions= Prior to the Norman invasions between 1067‚Äì1101, Christians of Gwynedd shared many of the spiritual traditions and ecclesiastical institutions found throughout Wales and other Celtic nations, customs inherited from the Celtic Christianity of the Early Middle Ages.Lloyd, J. E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Subjection of the Welsh Church, pgs 64‚Äì74Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Celtic Church, 72‚Äì79 Welsh Church pg 118Davies, John, The Celts, pg 126‚Äì155 However, Welsh ecclesiastics questioned to what degree the Papacy could impose Canon law upon them, especially with regard to the marriage of priests, the role of women both in the Church and in society, and the status of \\"illegitimate\\" children in society, with canon law conflicting with native Welsh law and customs. Welsh bishops also denied that the Archbishop of Canterbury held authority over them. Professor John Davies argued that there were dangers inherent in Welsh bishops submitting to an ecclesiastical authority \\"that would, by necessity, be heavily under the influence ... of an English king\\". Penmon Cross is an example of Celtic Christian traditions in Gwynedd. By the 11th century, the Welsh Church consisted of three dioceses which were tied closely together by a strong sense of community and a shared sentiment in religious practice, but were independent of each other and whose boundaries were somewhat indeterminate.Following the Norman invasions (1067‚Äì1100), a fourth diocese of St Asaph was carved out of the Bangor diocese, in order to compete against Bangor, which remained under the patronage of the native princely family. Central to this organisational approach was the rural nature of Welsh settlements which favoured localised and autonomous monastic communities called clasau (sing. clas). Clasau were administered by an abod (abbot) and contained a number of small timber-built churches and dormitory huts.The Normans disliked Welsh timber-built churches, and this was one of their critiques of the Welsh Church to justify the Norman invasion of Wales. The Normans considered timber-built structures unworthy to house places of worship, preferring stone built churches. Welsh monasticism highly valued asceticism, and the most celebrated Welsh ascetic was the 6th century St. David, who developed a monastic rule which emphasised hard work, encouraged vegetarianism, and promoted temperance. Women, who held a higher status in Welsh law and custom than elsewhere in Europe, could hold quasi-sacerdotal (semi-priestly) roles in the Welsh Church, noted Davies. As celibacy was not an important aspect of the Welsh Church, many priests married and had children; some monasteries were single or extended family endeavours, and some ecclesiastical offices became hereditary. For many Welsh people, monasticism was a familial way of life spent in devotion to Christ. As marriage was viewed as a secular social contract and governed by well-established Welsh law, divorce was recognised by the Welsh Church. The Diocese of Bangor was the episcopal see for all of Upper and Lower Gwynedd. =Latin Christianity= Post-Norman Invasion Gruffydd I of Gwynedd promoted the primacy of the episcopal see of Bangor in Gwynedd, and funded the building of Bangor Cathedral during the episcopate of David the Scot, Bishop of Bangor, between 1120‚Äì1139. Gruffydd's remains were interred in a tomb in the presbytery of Bangor Cathedral. Government and law Principal administrative divisions of medieval Gwynedd (traditional territorial extent) Aberffraw's traditional sphere of influence in north Wales included the Isle of Anglesey as their early seat of authority, and Gwynedd Uwch Conwy (Gwynedd above the Conway, or Upper Gwynedd), and the Perfeddwlad (\\"the Middle Country\\"), also known as Gwynedd Is Conwy (Gwynedd below the Conwy, or Lower Gwynedd). Additional lands were acquired through vassalage or conquest, and by regaining lands lost to Marcher lords, particularly those of Ceredigion, Powys Fadog, and Powys Wenwynwyn. However these areas were always considered additions to Gwynedd, never as part of Gwynedd itself. The extent of the kingdom varied with the strength of the current ruler. The kingdom was administered under Welsh custom through 13 cantrefi (hundreds, plural of cantref), each containing, in theory, one hundred settlements or trefi. Most cantrefi were divided further into cymydau (English: commotes). Gwynedd at war According to Sir John Edward Lloyd, the challenges of campaigning in Gwynedd and Wales as a whole were exposed during the Norman invasions between 1081 and 1101. If a defender could bar any road, control any river crossing or mountain pass, and control the coastline around Wales, then the risks of extended campaigning in Wales were too great. With control of the Menai, an army could regroup on Anglesey; without control of the Menai an army could be stranded there, and any occupying force on Anglesey could deny the vast harvest of that island to the Welsh. And the Welsh throughout Wales could lead retaliatory strikes from mountain strongholds or remote forested glens.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Gruffydd ap Cynan; Battle of Mynydd Carn, Norman Invasion, pg 104‚Äì108, reconstructing Gwynedd pg 116, The Welsh were revered for the skills of their bowmen; and they learned from the Normans. During the generations of warfare and close contact with the Normans, Gruffydd I and other Welsh leaders learned the arts of knighthood and adapted them for Wales. By Gruffydd's death in 1137, Gwynedd could field hundreds of heavy well-armed cavalry as well as their traditional bowmen and infantry. In the end Wales was defeated militarily by the improved ability of the English navy to blockade or seize areas essential for agricultural production, such as Anglesey. Lack of food would force the disbandment of any large Welsh force besieged in the mountains. Following the occupation, Welsh soldiers were conscripted to serve in the English army. During the revolt of Owain Glynd≈µr the Welsh adapted the new skills they had learnt to guerilla tactics and lightning raids. Owain reputedly used the mountains to such advantage that many of the exasperated English soldiery suspected him of being a magician able to control the natural elements.

Puthuppadi Grama Panchayat covers an area of 64.75 sq km and is spread over the villages of Engapuzha and Puthuppadi. The panchayat is bounded on the north by Thamarassery, Koorachund, Pozhuthana (Wayanad), Vythiri (Wayanad) panchayats, on the east by Vythiri (Wayanad) and Kodancheri panchayats, on the south by Thamarassery and Kodancheri panchayats and on the west by Thamarassery panchayat. Puthuppadi Panchayat is a beautiful agricultural village located near the Wayanad Pass, which is a natural fort that separates the districts of Kozhikode and Wayanad. Puthuppadi Panchayat is located 40 km northeast of Kozhikode town, adjoining Wayanad district. Many rivers and streams originating from the Western Ghats flow through this panchayath. The Kozhikode-Mysore National Highway, NH 766, passes through the heart of the panchayat. History It is said that the name Puthuppadi was derived from the word Paadi, meaning small shelter, that was made by the old estate owners and landlords to house their workers brought from other places. Until the enactment of the Kerala Panchayat Act 1960, on January 1 1962, Puthuppadi Panchayat was part of the Thamarassery Panchayat which functioned under the Madras Village Act. The governing body was constituted on 12 February 1962 under the leadership of Special Officer C. Raghavan. On December 18 1963, P. P. Sayeed became the first President of the Panchayat. The panchayat office, which had to operate alternately in many places without its own headquarters, was made permanent with the construction of a building on the land donated by the first president PP Sayeed. Administration Puthuppadi comes under Thiruvambady (State Assembly Constituency) and Wayanad Lok Sabha Constituency. Engapuzha is the main town in Puthuppadi. Here have some famous places. Landmarks # Markaz Knowledge City, Kaithappoyil # Vanaparvam, Kakkavayal # Wayanad Churam # Thusharagiri Waterfalls #LISSAH College, Manalvayal # St George Orthodox Church Puthuppady. It was built before 1950. Malabar's biggest Orthodox church # Assemblies of God Pentecostal church, Mylellampara Tourism Puthuppadi is one of the beautiful villages in the State of Kerala. The closest tourism destination to Puthuppadi is Lakkidi. Other nearby tourist destinations include Thusharagiri waterfalls, Kalpetta, Muthanga, and Wayanad. Education During the first half of the twentieth century, migration became widespread and large-scale cultivation began. Thus, the early cultural institutions must have been the places of worship established here belonging to different religions. Attempts to establish a high school and a library in Puthuppadi began in the 1970s. As a result, Puthuppadi Govt. High School was started in 1974 and Deepti Library in 1976. However, schools have been functioning here since 1949. The primary school in the village was the Elementary School started by the Malabar District Board in Kaithapoyil in 1949. This school is now known as Puthuppadi GMUP School. The second school is St. Anthony's School, which was started in 1950 under the auspices of Kannoth Catholic Church with Government approval. In 1955, it became the first UP school. The third is the NALP School which was started in 1951 in Manamel Estate in Engapuzha. It became NAUP in 1959 and MGM High School in 1983. In view of the absence of a high school in the panchayat, the land purchased under the leadership of K. P. Marcos in the name of St. Ostathios was later handed over to the Government and Puthuppadi Govt. High School was sanctioned in 1974 after paying a bond of Rs. 25,000. It is one of the high academic schools in Kozhikode district. The school has long been ranked second in government schools in terms of pass percentage. The children of this Panchayat still depend on educational institutions in Kozhikode town for higher education. Culture Although there is no accurate information about the life of the people before the twentieth century, the evidence found at Ambalakandi, Chaliyakkadavu, Kunjukulam, Kurumarukandi and Kakkavayal, as well as the ruins of many ruined temples, indicate that highly civilized people had lived here. Traditional arts and crafts are becoming unpopular today. Everyone, regardless of caste or creed, participates in temple festivals and church festivals. Duffmuttu, Kolkali and Udukupattu are active in some places. Before independence, Puthuppadi did not have much to say in the field of education. It is said that some temples were held at Engapuzha, 26th Mile and Kannoth. In the early days, there was little effort to cultivate the habit of reading or to establish cultural centers in the vicinity of the plantation for a living. However, the people here have always been keen on maintaining a high cultural awareness and the progressive thinking, contribution and tolerance that is part of it. Deepti is the first club in the panchayat with its own building and about 500 members. Sports The panchayat has contributed national level talents in the field of sports. Arjuna Award winning Indian volleyball player Sally Joseph, handball Indian team member Sheeba Mathew, T. M. Abdurahman winning medals in high jump and athletics at national competitions, Lousy Kurian who have won medals at national competitions, cross country national Rosly Abraham, and Kho Kho national player K. P. David are all contributions of Puthuppadi Transportation Although the rugged cliffs and rocks succumbed to the will of the ancestors for their livelihood, the transportable roads and vehicular facilities at that time were simply a mirage. However, recognizing the strength of team spirit and the important role that roads play in the development of the country, they had built many local roads by the time the panchayat was formed. This was followed by the construction of more roads. The Kozhikode-Mysore-Kollegal National Highway,NH 766, which passes through the center of the panchayat, plays a vital role in the road map of Kerala. Thus, the Panchayat has a well-developed network of roads that connects the Panchayat with other places in the district as well as in the state. Buses, both Government-owned (KSRTC) and private-owned, offer services to various destinations. The nearest railway station is Kozhikode Railway Station (CLT) which is at a distance of 40 kilometers. The nearest airport is Calicut International Airport, which is at a distance of 53 kilometers. Ecology Puthuppadi Panchayath, which is in the third position in Koduvally Block Panchayat in terms of area, is fully covered by the hilly landscape. The landscape of the panchayath includes hundreds of small and large hills, numerous streams and rivers originating from the Western Ghats and paddy fields. Red soil is the main soil type. Black sandstone, Sandstone and Gravel are also found. The fertile soil is suitable for the cultivation of coconut, paddy, spices and rubber. The climate in the panchayat is generally favorable. The heat is very low and it also gets more rain in the middle of the year. Demographics , Puthuppadi has a population of 42083 with a population density of 649.93.

Leading among the caves in the area is the Harlansburg Cave, Pennsylvania's longest cave, which has been reported to extend from Harlansburg (eleven miles away) to Rose Point. Smaller caves such as the Rose Point Cave also exist in the area, parallel to the Harlansburg Cave; all these caves are believed to have been formed by stream water forced underground during wetter times of the year, causing their passages to be maze-like rather than linear. History Rose Point Reformed Presbyterian Church The first settler in the Rose Point vicinity were Abraham Wigle and Samuel Stickle of Westmoreland County, who arrived in 1804. Wigle was the first of many to harness the power of the Slippery Rock Creek, building a gristmill and a sawmill on its banks in about 1825; although Wigle's mill was destroyed by water, another mill (later abandoned) was built shortly before 1850, and the still-preserved McConnells Mill is just 2 miles (3 km) downstream. Various businesses were established in the community, including a hotel, blacksmiths' and cobblers' shops, and multiple stores. Two churches were established in the community: one Reformed Presbyterian (which still exists), and one Roman Catholic. Slippery Rock Township's natural resources were exploited in Rose Point, with iron furnaces being built to use locally-produced iron ore, coal, and limestone. Of these two, the Willie Roy or Wilroy Furnace, built in 1854, has been recognized as a Pennsylvania state historic location.Wilroy Furnace, OurHistoricPlaces, 2008. Accessed 2008-12-12.

The son of a metal foundry worker, he was born in Paris, France. In his younger years, he served an apprenticeship in jewelry making, perfecting the techniques of casting, engraving, and embossing semi- precious and simulated stones into gold and silver metals. In his decades of creating fine jewelry, Goossens mixed the genuine stones with the fakes, a blend of the artificial gems with the semi-precious for clients including Coco Chanel, Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Madame Gr√®s, Christian Dior and others. Design Aesthetic Goossens's designs were heavily influenced by paintings and artifacts in Paris museums, with inspiration most often taken from Maltese, Byzantium, and Renaissance works. Over the years, he traveled extensively, frequently bringing back stones including sapphires, amethysts, rubies, coral, and chalcedony. Concerning rock crystal, after restoring a cross belonging to Madame Chanel, the stone became his favorite material. It is a clear and colorless variety of quartz. Goossens became the first to set it into pieces of jewelry; he felt that its delicate and inexpensive attributes were well suited to costume jewelry. He also utilized bronze, shells, pearls, colored and, as mentioned, natural rock crystal in necklace, brooch, bracelet and earring designs. Work with the Maison Chanel Starting in 1954 with his creation of the Byzantine style, Goossens worked with Coco Chanel to design jewelry to accompany her fashion designs, mostly through presentations where she would guide his inspiration. Chanel herself loved to blend the rich with the poor, and Goossens's creations were entirely in keeping with that approach. Notable work during his tenure at Chanel includes silver and gold plated pins set with emeralds, moon earth pendants, and crystal Byzantine crosses. Goossens would create original pieces for Chanel herself made of real gold and genuine stones, which in turn were copied as imitations designed for fashion shows and presentations. These models ultimately served as the basis for Chanel's costume jewelry designs. Goossens continued his work with the Maison Chanel after its founder's passing, and collaborated with her successor Karl Lagerfeld throughout the 1980s and 1990s to create costume jewelry for the Maison Chanel's ready-to-wear and couture collections. Chanel bought Goossens's workshop in 2005. Goossen's workshop north of Paris is still operating to this day, employing about 50 people to handcraft his designs. The Goossens boutique is located in Paris on the avenue George V. Some of his works are part of the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs collections. He died at the age of 88.

The village's landscape can be divided into six plains, slopes, valleys, plains, rivers and streams. Parappur Panchayath was established in the year 1956, the year of Kerala's birth. Kadalundipuzha Panchayat, which originates from Sahyadri and flows through Karuvarakundu basement and many panchayats in Malappuram district, divides it into two. The first president was TE Muhammad Haji. Elections were not held at that time. The delegates were elected through a hands-on vote at the Block Foundation.  History  Kottakkal East Kovilakam which belonged to the Zamorin of Calicut was the landlord of most of the land holdings in the area. The landlords who owned the land in Iringalloor belonged to the Kolpuram Keezhathukunnam Panicker family, which had its roots in Kozhikode. The legendary Land Reforms Act, implemented in the 1970s, brought the veil to feudalism in other parts of Kerala as well. The old Juma Masjid, such as Ililipilakkal, Vettam, Palani, Kuzhipuram West Palli, Kuzhipuram East Mosque, Veenalukkal Juma Masjid and Vadakkum Muri Mosque are around 200 to 400 years old. The Sree Kurumba Temple at Veenalukkal, the Sree Subramanya Temple, the Iringalloor Sree Ayyappan Kavu Temple, the Katiyakavu Sreebhagavati Temple and the Ashramamangalam Shiva Temple are some of the ancient temples. Established in the East of the 20th Century, Parappur, a leading educational center, was established in 1901 in East Kund, becoming the East AMLP School. The eleventh state congress of the historic Congress was held in 1939 under the leadership of EMS Namboodiripad, who was the then KPCC President Mohammed Abdurahiman Sahib. The first educational institute to be established in the Parappur Panchayath was the Callakkattil School which was established in 1901 and the only Teachers' School which was established in 1903 in the East.. Geography The village has an area of 15.11 km2 (4,473 sq mi) and is bordered by Vengara, Ooragam and Othukkungal villages to the north and Othukkungal village to the east, Edarikkod and Kottakkal villages to the south and the Edarikkod and Vengara towards the west.it is under the Vengara legislative assembly seat. Kadalundi River flows through many regions in the Parappur village. Some times during the extreme monsoon seasons the river tends to overflow and makes its way to the village settlements and the paddy fields causing disturbances to the local life. Demographics India census, Parappur had a population of 36270 with 16975 males and 19295 females. Culture Parappur village is a predominantly Muslim populated area. Hindus are exist in comparatively smaller numbers. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Some of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala.  Economy  The movement of many migrant workers from the village to the GCC states continues to the present day, although in smaller numbers after the 2008 international financial crisis began to affect the GCC region. Transportation Parappur village connects to other parts of India through Kottakkal town. National highway No.66 passes through Tanur and the northern stretch connects to Goa and Mumbai.

Given a polynomial ring R = k[X1, ... Xn] where k is some field, an Artinian ideal is an ideal I in R for which the Krull dimension of the quotient ring R/I is 0. Also, less precisely, one can think of an Artinian ideal as one that has at least each indeterminate in R raised to a power greater than 0 as a generator. If an ideal is not Artinian, one can take the Artinian closure of it as follows. First, take the least common multiple of the generators of the ideal. Second, add to the generating set of the ideal each indeterminate of the LCM with its power increased by 1 if the power is not 0 to begin with. An example is below. Examples Let R = k[x,y,z], and let I = (x^2,y^5,z^4), \\\\; J = (x^3, y^2, z^6, x^2yz^4, yz^3) and \\\\displaystyle{K = (x^3, y^4, x^2z^7)}.

This highway links Birmingham with its southern suburbs of Homewood, Mountain Brook, and Vestavia Hills. It has spurred suburban growth towards the south of Birmingham. This section also provides the route for U.S. Route 31 (US 31) to the south (the Montgomery Highway) and US 280 to the southeast. The resultant cut exposes geological strata spanning millions of years (150 million years of geological time within of exposure), including the red ore seam that spurred Birmingham's development. A new species of Lower Silurian (middle Llandovery epoch) phacopsid trilobite, Acaste birminghamensis, was first collected from exposures on Red Mountain. Named for the city, the new species was published in May 1972. The cut was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1987. Proposed tunnel One of the original ideas proposed for linking Birmingham to its southern neighbors was the Red Mountain Tunnel project. This was seriously considered by the city and state highway engineers. Two alternate routes were proposed, one starting at 18th Street and the other from 22nd Street. Eventually the tunnel idea was abandoned due to its high cost and extended amount of time it would have taken. The Red Mountain Expressway Cut was built instead.

It inhabits coral reefs and can be found at depths from . This species can reach a total length of . It can be found in the aquarium as well as ocean trade. The Fairy Wrasse fishes, genus Cirrhilabrus, have many species that are found all over the Info- Pacific. The fairy wrasses are known for their bright neon colors.1 The Orangeback Fairy Wrasses are like many wrasses in that they live in harems of many females in a group with only one male. The male is the dominant fish with the stronger colors and traits. There have been no small males that have been recorded so it is believed that all Orangeback Fairy Wrasses‚Äô begin as females and then some females transform into males.1 The Cirrhilabrus species eats mainly Zooplankton, they have pair of teeth in the front and a set of teeth wrapped around the side which is used to break down their food.2 Orangeback Fairy wrasses are found in shallow waters mainly ranging from 10‚Äì75 feet but also can be found deeper.2 When the Fairy wrasses are found in deeper depths however, their fluorescence allows them to see wavelengths that wouldn't otherwise be available. All Fairy Wrasses have great ability to see red fluorescence which is extremely unique as most fish have poor sensitivity within this area.4 There is much still not known about Orangeback Fairy Wrasses as most of the species have not been found in the open ocean.1 However, we do know that the males and females vary significantly from how they act to their sensitivities to different colors and wavelengths.

In a book on the topic, Tits and Richard Weiss classify them all. An earlier theorem, proved independently by Tits and Weiss, 51 (3), (1979) 267‚Äì269 . showed that a Moufang polygon must be a generalized 3-gon, 4-gon, 6-gon, or 8-gon, so the purpose of the aforementioned book was to analyze these four cases. Definitions *A generalized n-gon is a bipartite graph of diameter n and girth 2n. *A graph is called thick if all vertices have valence at least 3. *A root of a generalized n-gon is a path of length n. *An apartment of a generalized n-gon is a cycle of length 2n. *The root subgroup of a root is the subgroup of automorphisms of a graph that fix all vertices adjacent to one of the inner vertices of the root. *A Moufang n-gon is a thick generalized n-gon (with n>2) such that the root subgroup of any root acts transitively on the apartments containing the root.  Moufang 3-gons  A Moufang 3-gon can be identified with the incidence graph of a Moufang projective plane. In this identification, the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building. Real forms of Lie groups give rise to examples which are the three main types of Moufang 3-gons. There are four real division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions, of dimensions 1,2,4 and 8, respectively. The projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a Moufang 3-gon. These projective planes correspond to the building attached to SL3(R), SL3(C), a real form of A5 and to a real form of E6, respectively. In the first diagram the circled nodes represent 1-spaces and 2-spaces in a three-dimensional vector space. In the second diagram the circled nodes represent 1-space and 2-spaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the quaternions, which in turn represent certain 2-spaces and 4-spaces in a 6-dimensional complex vector space, as expressed by the circled nodes in the A5 diagram. The fourth case ‚Äî a form of E6 ‚Äî is exceptional, and its analogue for Moufang 4-gons is a major feature of Weiss‚Äôs book. Going from the real numbers to an arbitrary field, Moufang 3-gons can be divided into three cases as above. The split case in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. The third case involves ‚Äòalternative‚Äô division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of Richard Bruck and Erwin Kleinfeld shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras. This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.  Moufang 4-gons  Moufang 4-gons are also called Moufang quadrangles. The classification of Moufang 4-gons was the hardest of all, and when Tits and Weiss started to write it up, a hitherto unnoticed type came into being, arising from groups of type F4. They can be divided into three classes: * (i) Those arising from classical groups. * (ii) Those arising from ‚Äúmixed groups‚Äù (in which there are two imperfect fields of characteristic 2, K and L, with K2 ‚äÇ L ‚äÇ K). * (iii) Those arising from quadrangular algebras. There is some overlap here, in the sense that some classical groups arising from pseudo-quadratic spaces can be obtained from quadrangular algebras (which Weiss calls special), but there are other, non-special ones. The most important of these arise from algebraic groups of types E6, E7, and E8. They are k-forms of algebraic groups belonging to the following diagrams: E6 E7 E8. The E6 one exists over the real numbers, though the E7 and E8 ones do not. Weiss calls the quadrangular algebras in all these cases Weiss regular, but not special. There is a further type that he calls defective arising from groups of type F4. These are the most exotic of all‚Äîthey involve purely inseparable field extensions in characteristic 2‚Äîand Weiss only discovered them during the joint work with Tits on the classification of Moufang 4-gons by investigating a strange lacuna that should not have existed but did. The classification of Moufang 4-gons by Tits and Weiss is related to their intriguing monograph in two ways. One is that the use of quadrangular algebras short-cuts some of the methods known before. The other is that the concept is an analogue to the octonion algebras, and quadratic Jordan division algebras of degree 3, that give rise to Moufang 3-gons and 6-gons. In fact all the exceptional Moufang planes, quadrangles, and hexagons that do not arise from \\"mixed groups\\" (of characteristic 2 for quadrangles or characteristic 3 for hexagons) come from octonions, quadrangular algebras, or Jordan algebras.  Moufang 6-gons  Moufang 6-gons are also called Moufang hexagons. A classification of Moufang 6-gons was stated by Tits,J. Tits, Classification of buildings of spherical type and Moufang polygons: a survey, in Coll. Internaz. Teorie Combinatorie, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17, Rome 1976, pp. 229‚Äì246. though the details remained unproven until the joint work with Weiss on Moufang Polygons.  Moufang 8-gons  Moufang 8-gons are also called Moufang octagons. They were classified by Tits, where he showed that they all arise from Ree groups of type ¬≤F‚ÇÑ. Quadrangular algebras A potential use for quadrangular algebras is to analyze two open questions. One is the Kneser-Tits conjectureJ. Tits, Groupes de Whitehead de groupes alg√©briques simples sur un corps, S√©minaire Bourbaki, 1976‚Äì77, no. 505; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 677, Springer-Verlag, 1977. that concerns the full group of linear transformations of a building (e.g. GLn) factored out by the subgroup generated by root groups (e.g. SLn). The conjecture is proved for all Moufang buildings except the 6-gons and 4-gons of type E8, in which case the group of linear transformations is conjectured to be equal to the subgroup generated by root groups. For the E8 hexagons this can be rephrased as a question on quadratic Jordan algebras, and for the E8 quadrangles it can now be rephrased in terms of quadrangular algebras. Another open question about the E8 quadrangle concerns fields that are complete with respect to a discrete valuation: is there, in such cases, an affine building that yields the quadrangle as its structure at infinity?

It was still left empty in 1685 by peasants, more than two centuries after the dynasty's fall, thinking it may one day return and bring prosperity back to Kamakura. (also called , , or ) was a title equivalent to sh≈çgun assumed by Ashikaga Motouji after his nomination to Kant≈ç kanrei, or deputy sh≈çgun for the Kamakura-fu, in 1349.Kokushi Daijiten (1983:542) Motouji transferred his original title to the Uesugi family, which had previously held the hereditary title of , and would thereafter provide the Kant≈ç kanrei. The Ashikaga had been forced to move to Kyoto, abandoning Kamakura and the Kant≈ç region, because of the continuing difficulties they had keeping the Emperor and the loyalists under control (see the article Nanboku-ch≈ç period). Motouji had been sent by his father, sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji, precisely because the latter understood the importance of controlling the Kant≈ç region and wanted to have an Ashikaga ruler there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness. The sh≈çgun's idea never really worked and actually backfired. After Motouji, all the kub≈ç wanted power over the whole country. The Kant≈ç kub≈ç era is therefore essentially a struggle for the shogunate between the Kamakura and the Kyoto branches of the Ashikaga clan.Matsuo (1997:119-120) In the end, Kamakura had to be retaken by force by troops from Kyoto. The five kub≈ç recorded by history, all of Motouji's bloodline, were in order Motouji himself, Ujimitsu, Mitsukane, Mochiuji and Shigeuji.Note that Shigeuji is an unusual reading of the characters ÊàêÊ∞è, that would be normally be read Nariuji. The reading Nariuji is common in print and over the Internet. Authoritative texts like the Kokushi Daijiten invariably use Shigeuji. Birth of the Kant≈ç kub≈ç The Kamakura-fu at the time of its maximum expansionIn the first weeks of 1336,Gregorian date obtained directly from the original Neng≈ç using Nengocalc : (Kenmu era, 1st month) two years after the fall of Kamakura, the first of the Ashikaga shoguns Ashikaga Takauji left the city for Kyoto in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada. He left behind his 4-year-old son Yoshiakira as his representative in the trust of three guardians: Hosokawa Kiyouji, Uesugi Noriaki, and Shiba Ienaga.Jansen (1995:119-120) Because the three were related to him through blood or marriage, he believed they would keep Kant≈ç loyal to him. This action formally divided the country in two, giving the east and the west separate administrations with similar rights to power. Not only did both had Ashikaga rulers, but Kamakura, which until very recently had been the seat of a shogunate, was still capital of the Kant≈ç, and independentist feelings were strong among Kamakura samurai. In 1349 Takauji called Yoshiakira to Kyoto replacing him with one of his sons, Motouji, to whom he gave the title of Kant≈ç kanrei, or Kant≈ç deputy. At first the territory under his rule, known as Kamakura-fu, included the eight Kant≈ç provinces (the ), plus Kai and Izu.Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, Kamakura-fu Later, Kant≈ç Kub≈ç Ashikaga Ujimitsu was given by the shogunate as a reward for his military support the two huge provinces of Mutsu and Dewa. The sh≈çgun's deputy in the Kant≈ç region had the vital task to keep it under control. Structurally, his government was a small- scale version of Kyoto's shogunate and had full judiciary and executive powers. Because the kanrei was the son of the sh≈çgun, ruled the Kant≈ç and controlled the military there, the area was usually called Kamakura Bakufu (Kamakura Shogunate), and Motouji or Kamakura/Kant≈ç Gosho, an equivalent title. When later the habit of calling kub≈ç the sh≈çgun spread from Kyoto to the Kant≈ç, the ruler of Kamakura came to be called Kamakura Kub≈ç. The Kanrei title was passed on to the Uesugi hereditary shitsuji. The first time the title appears in writing is in a 1382 entry of a document called , under second Kub≈ç Ujimitsu. This term had been first adopted by Ashikaga Takauji himself, and its use therefore implied equality to the sh≈çgun.Sansom (147-148) In fact, sometimes the Kanto Kub≈ç was called Kant≈ç sh≈çgun.  Instability of the Kant≈ç region  This inherently unstable double-headed power structure was made even more problematic by the continuous display of independence of the Kant≈ç region. Kamakura had just been conquered and its desire of independence was still strong. Also, many of the Ashikaga in Kamakura had been supporters of the sh≈çgun's dead brother Ashikaga Tadayoshi and resented Takauji's rule. Consequently, after Motouji's death, Kamakura made clear it didn't want to be ruled by Kyoto. The intentions of the Kant≈ç Ashikaga were made crystal clear by their confiscation of the Ashikaga-no-sh≈ç: the family piece of land in Shimotsuke Province that had given the name to the clan.Hall (1990:177) Second kub≈ç Ujimitsu and his descendants tried to expand their influence, causing a series of incidents. By the time of third sh≈çgun Yoshimitsu, the Kamakura branch of the Ashikaga clan was regarded with suspicion. Tension continued to mount until it came to a head between sixth sh≈çgun Yoshinori and fourth kub≈ç Mochiuji. Mochiuji had hoped to succeed Ashikaga Yoshimochi as sh≈çgun and was disappointed by seeing Yoshinori rob him of the post. To express his displeasure, he refused to use the new sh≈çgun's era name (neng≈ç).Hall (1990:232-233) In 1439 Yoshinori sent his army to the Kant≈ç, and Mochiuji was defeated and forced to kill himself. In 1449 Kyoto made one last effort to make the system work. Shigeuji, last descendant of Motouji, was nominated Kant≈ç kub≈ç and sent to Kamakura. The relationship between him and the Uesugi was strained from the beginning and culminated with Shigeuji's killing of Uesugi Noritada, a murder that made the Kant≈ç province fall into chaos. (See also the article Ky≈çtoku Incident.) In 1455 Shigeuji was deposed by Kyoto forces and had to escape to Koga in Shim≈çsa Province, from where he directed a rebellion against the shogunate. This was the end of the Kant≈ç kub≈ç. The title would survive, but effective power would be in the hands of the Uesugi. Because he no longer was Kant≈ç kub≈ç, Shigeuji now called himself Koga kub≈ç. In 1457, eighth sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent his younger brother Masatomo with an army to pacify Kant≈ç, but Masatomo was unable to even enter Kamakura. This was the beginning of an era in which the Kant≈ç and Kamakura were devastated by a series of civil wars called the Sengoku period. The 5th Kant≈ç kubo under the Later H≈çj≈ç clan was Ashikaga Yoshiuji, his daughter, Ashikaga Ujinohime succeeded Yoshiuji after his death. Ujinohime was the last Koga Kubo after Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered the Later H≈çj≈ç clan, she was moved to K≈çnosu Palace in 1590.  The Kant≈ç kub≈ç's residence in Kamakura  The stele that marks the spot in Kamakura where the kub≈ç's mansion used to stand At the location of the former Kant≈ç kub≈ç residence in Kamakura stands a black memorial stele, whose inscription reads: > \\"After Minamoto no Yoritomo founded his shogunate, Ashikaga YoshikaneHead of > the Ashikaga clan. made this place his residence. His descendants also > resided here for well over 200 years thereafter. After Ashikaga Takauji > became sh≈çgun and moved to Kyoto, his son and second sh≈çgun Yoshiakira > decided to also live there.

The nearby Asaina Pass guaranteed an easy escape in a siege. According to the Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book published in 1685, more than two centuries later after Shigeuji's escape, the spot where the kub≈ç's mansion had been was left empty by local peasants in the hope he may return.

The well which provides the holy water (theertham) to the temple also has some special features. The holy water from this well which never dry or overflow is believed that the water is from the holy river Ganges. The water in the well never gets sunlight. There is a way to this underground well from inside the temple for collecting the holy water by the priest. Higher than this temple the famous Mekkotta Bhagavathi Temple situates on the top of the hill. One will feel how beauty and solitude provides mental relaxation when staying here for worship. The vast area around this temple provides the scope for forestation. The peak of the hill and the river which flows round the hill is a really beautiful sight. The beauty, elegance and the peacefulness of this area have the scope of developing into a shooting location and a tourist center. The armory and training center of Parappanadu Kingdom was situated in the place where Mekkotta Bhagavathy Temple now exists. The remains like tunnels and trenches seen around Mekkotta Temple are evidence for this.

Distribution The eight-lined wrasse has an Indo-West Pacific distribution and is found from the Comoros and the Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean to Hawaii and Ducie Island, extending north to Yaeyama Islands in Japan and south to New Caledonia, in the Pacific Ocean. Habitat and biology The eight-lined wrasse is a benthopelagic species which is found among rubble or live corals of seaward reefs, where it prefers areas where there are caves and crevices containing abundant invertebrate growth, They are found down to depths of at least . It is a carnivorous fish which preys mostly on benthic crustaceans, as well as small molluscs, sea urchins, fish eggs, and crab larvae. This is a solitary, diurnal species which takes shelter in cavities where it creates a mucus cocoon in which to sleep during the night, it is thought that this cocoon helps protect it from nocturnal predators by masking the scent of the sleeping fish. Human usage The eight-lined wrasse is found in the aquarium[ trade, although they have not been bred in captivity, but is not commonly traded. Species description was first formally described by the American physiologist and histologist Oliver Peebles Jenkins (1850-1935) with the type locality being given as Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii.

This species appears in the aquarium trade due to its vibrant colors. A special feature about this species is how much they change from juvenile to adult form, in color, behaviour, and diet.  Description  Similar in appearance to its cousin, Coris gaimard, the queen coris can measure between the range of 20 cm when young, but can grow up to approximately 60 cm. Its coloration usually varies within three different color patterns, generally it tends to be reddish to lavender in vibrant, striking color. Its general color ranges. When adults is blue-greenish with dark edges and dark blue spots, covering its body mainly towards the tail, and a red-orange line on its posterior margin towards the tail. Towards the rostrum, adult queen coris also display vibrant, light blue organic lines. The fish has nine dorsal spines, twelve dorsal soft rays, and three anal spines. When young Coris formosa are orange and brown in the bottom, with long white spots on dorsal part of body, one can say it resembles a Clown Fish's color. However, the vibrant, blue features develop in adulthood.. It is hypothesized that their variation on color depends on the depth at which they are found, but it mainly has a marked variation between juvenile and adulthood. Color is a crucial feature for Coris formosa because it is for social display purposes, used to attract potential mating partners and combative relationships between males. The fish have small protruding teeth for feeding mostly on hard-shelled organisms.  Distribution and Habitat  Adults of this species are inhabitants of neritic oceanic coral reefs and can be found at depths from ,meaning they are found in tropical waters within 24 ¬∞C to 27 ¬∞C in temperature. While juveniles are commonly found in tide pools adults can be found usually on rocky and coral areas, sometimes in weeds. The species is distributed along the Western Indian Ocean, Southern Red Sea, South Africa and east to Sri Lanka.  Diet  Queen coris feed on hard-shell prey, such as crustaceans (shrimps, crabs and amphipods) and echinoderms (sea urchin and small molluscs). As their teeth develop in adulthood, these fish are very efficient in predating hard shells, and can become very aggressive and destructive. The young ones feed mainly on other smaller organisms, such as krill until they become able to prey on hard- shelled organisms.  Reproduction  Similar to most fish, queen coris is oviparous, which means it produces its offspring from various eggs. It is a protogynous fish meaning it is semi-hermaphrodite. A semi-hermaphrodite can change gender from female to male. In this case, a female's reproductive parts develop before its male reproductive parts, and in most cases populations are mainly female. However, when a male is needed, then one of the females will turn into a male for reproduction purposes. Queen coris display polygamy or distinct pairing during breeding; Consequently, males are dominant and usually are in charge of a large female harem or various harems, especially during reproduction. This situation can occur even though they are a solitary species. It is hypothesized that males pursue females by swimming along them and fluttering their fins.  Behaviour  Queen coris are a very aggressive species because they are very dominant, especially males during mating season. Aggression in fish is mostly due to territorial purposes and the Queen Coris is no exception. It can be a big threat to small fish, and it is a very effective invertebrate hunter. In aquariums, it has a habit of rearranging sand and rocks, and it tends to dig itself down in sandy substrate. The digging may serve for various purposes, such as breeding as they may lay eggs and protect them under the sand. Another reason for the digging could be in foraging for food, considering that most of the queen coris‚Äô prey is buried in the sand. They may also be digging in soft substrate either to sleep or to build some sort of cave as a home. It is a solitary fish and is extremely destructive in captivity, especially when it grows particularly large. It requires a lot of space for swimming and when in captivity, it tends to hide under the sand at first while they acclimatize. When adult Queen Coris‚Äô are too large, they tend to hide in small cracks between corals or rocks.  Conservation  It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and can also be found in the aquarium trade. The species lay in the category of least concern, their major threats is aquarium trade. However the trade does not sufficiently attempt to harm the fish and consequently, they are currently in a very low risk of extinction.> References queen coris Fish of the Indian Ocean queen coris ","title":"Queen coris"},{"id":"20675112","text":"Koduvayur-II is a village in the Palakkad district, state of Kerala, India.

Description The canary wrasse is a small fish that can reach a maximum length of 12 cm. It has a thin, elongate body with a terminal mouth. Body coloration is bright yellow with a few variations according to age. Juvenile and immature female have two black spots rimmed with white or light yellow on the dorsal fin (the first one at the start of the fin (head side) and the second in the middle of its dorsal fin) and a third one between the caudal peduncle and the start of the caudal fin. Mature females or young males only show the two black spots on the dorsal fin. Mature males display only the first black spot on the front of the dorsal fin, a lighter-colored spot just behind the eye and irregular greenish to pinkish lines on the face. Distribution and habitat The canary wrasse is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the central Indo-Pacific, in an area bordered by the Christmas Islands and Indonesia, Japan, New South Wales and the Rowley Shoals, and the Tonga Islands and Solomon Islands. This wrasse occurs on outside reef slopes, in rubble and sandy areas from surface down to a depth of 30 meters. Biology The canary wrasse lives in small groups. It is a benthic predator that feeds mainly on small marine invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs, worms and echinoderms captured on or in the substrate. Like most wrasse, the canary wrasse is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals start life as females with the capability of turning male later on. Conservation status The species is targeted but not thought to be threatened by the aquarium trade.

A West Point graduate, he fought in the United States Army during the Seminole Wars, in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and he served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Early life and career Thomas J. McKean was born in 1810 in the borough of Burlington located in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. He entered the United States Military Academy in West Point in 1827, and graduated four years later, standing 19th out of 33 cadets. McKean was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1831.Eicher, p. 379. His service in the U.S. Army consisted of several stints of garrison duty over the next three years,Warner, p. 301. during which he was promoted to second lieutenant on September 15, 1833. McKean resigned from the U.S. Army the following year on March 31. After resigning in 1834, McKean took up work as a civil engineer. He then participated in the Seminole Wars in 1837-38, serving as adjutant of the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers, with the rank of first lieutenant.Eicher, p. 379. Date of rank November 1, 1837. McKean resigned on March 31, 1838, and returned to Pennsylvania and the profession of an engineer. In 1840 he relocated to Marion in the Iowa Territory, and in 1844 he was part of the constitutional convention aimed at creating the state of Iowa. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, McKean volunteered for service, and enlisted as a private in the 15th U.S. Infantry on April 12, 1847. He was quickly promoted to sergeant major on May 10, and fought in the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, in which he was wounded. That June, McKean was appointed to the rank of brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons, but he chose to decline the commission. After hostilities ended, he was discharged on August 7, 1848. Historian Ezra J. Warner noted McKean's unusual situation of having been trained at West Point and served in other duties as an officer, but was as an enlisted man in combat while in Mexico.Warner, p. 301. \\"He had the curious distinction of serving throughout the Mexican War as an enlisted man, failing to obtain a commission despite his age and experience.\\" Following the war he returned to his civilian life in Iowa, a U.S. state since 1846. Civil War service McKean and his staff during the American Civil War When the American Civil War began in 1861, McKean chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. On June 1 he was appointed the paymaster of the Union Army, and then led the cavalry of the Department of the Gulf beginning on September 18. McKean was briefly in charge of prisoner of war camps in Missouri, and was appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army on November 21.Eicher, p. 379. Supervised POW camps in Missouri beginning on November 9 and lasting into December 1861. McKean commanded at Jefferson City, Missouri, from December to March 1862. He was then given divisional command in the Army of the Tennessee on April 10. He fought in the Battle of Corinth in Mississippi on October 3-4, and then led his division until December 9. McKean then commanded numerous districts across Union-held departments throughout 1863, 1864, and until July 10, 1865.Warner, p. 301. Ezra J. Warner believed McKean's age (nearly 51 at the start of the war) was the principal reason he held very few field commands. McKean was appointed to the rank of brevet major general on March 13 for his war service, and was mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24. Postbellum After the American Civil War ended in 1865, McKean returned home to Iowa. He was elected Marion's mayor that year, and took up farming close to the city until 1869. He served as a delegate to the Republican convention in Chicago, Illinois, in 1868. McKean was offered the position of pension agent of the eastern Iowa district in early 1870, but he declined it. That April he died in Marion, Iowa, and was buried in the city's Oak Shade Cemetery.Eicher, p. 380.

It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. Description left The harlequin tuskfish grows to length of . It is a brightly colored marine fish with shades of blue, green, and orange. It has sharp blue teeth. The specimens found in Australia generally have brighter coloration. Diet The harlequin tuskfish is a carnivore, eating mostly benthic invertebrates such as echinoderms, crustaceans, molluscs, and worms. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the western Pacific Ocean in two separate areas. One is from the Ryukyus to Taiwan and the other is from Queensland, Australia, to New Caledonia. This species inhabits reefs at depths from . Recently, this fish has been observed to be a tool user in the sense that it will carry small clams to a home base where it will fling it against a hard surface such as a rock multiple times until it breaks open, allowing the fish to eat the soft parts. This behavior was observed multiple times and filmed in the making of BBC's TV series Blue Planet II, qualifying this fish as a tool using animal. In the Aquarium The Harlequin Tusk is a moderately difficult fish to maintain in captivity. Juveniles can be shy and easily bullied by aggressive tankmates, while adults will be quite aggressive. At a minimum, they should be kept in a 120-gallon tank for a single specimen. They will accept frozen and meaty foods such as brine shrimp, mysis, and shellfish. It is a semi-aggressive fish and ideal tankmates would include angels, tangs, and small triggerfish. However, it will not tolerate its own kind, so there should be only one specimen per tank. They are not reef-safe. Although they will typically not nip at corals or sessile invertebrates, they will attack and consume crabs, hermit crabs, snails, and shrimp.https://liveaquaria.com/product/380/?pcatid=380 A reef temperature of 78F-80F is ideal for maintaining the Harlequin Tusk.

Synopsis  The book contains accessible popular expositions on the mathematical theory of infinity, and a number of related topics. These include G√∂del's incompleteness theorems and their relationship to concepts of artificial intelligence and the human mind, as well as the conceivability of some unconventional cosmological models. The material is approached from a variety of viewpoints, some more conventionally mathematical and others being nearly mystical. There is a brief account of the author's personal contact with Kurt G√∂del. An appendix contains one of the few popular expositions on set theory research on what are known as \\"strong axioms of infinity.\\" Reception Dave Langford reviewed Infinity and the Mind for White Dwarf #41, and stated that \\"a must for anyone who enjoyed Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach or the works of Martin Gardner.\\" Infinity and the Mind was reviewed by the New Yorker, which asserted that \\"Rudy Rucker's Infinity and the Mind is a terrific study with real mathematical depth.\\" Martin Gardner described the book as \\"Informal, amusing, witty, profound... In an extraordinary burst of creative energy, Rudy Rucker has managed to bring together every aspect of mathematical infinity.... A dizzying glimpse into that boundless region of blinding light where the mysteries of transcendence shatter the clarity of logic, set theory, proof theory, and contemporary physics.\\"  Marketing  The dust jacket of the original (Birkh√§user) edition had a picture of a star over a mountain and appeared to be a religious or mystical work. Subsequent paperback reprintings had covers suggesting that the publishers wished to appeal to a \\"new age\\" market.

It was released in Japan on November 6, 2003 and later in Europe on March 26, 2004. Plot Glass Rose primarily takes place in a remote Japanese mansion in 1929. The player assumes the role of an amateur reporter named Takashi Kagetani. While exploring an abandoned mansion with his friend Emi in the year 2003, he is knocked unconscious by a supernatural force and awakens seventy years in the past, where the mansion has been restored to its former glory. In order to return to his own time, Takashi is forced to explore the mansion and interact with its denizens, the Yoshinodou family. Takashi also finds that the time warp has left him with the ability to briefly glimpse into a person's mind while conversing with them. By employing this ability, he can investigate into a series of murders in the Yoshinodou household. Gameplay The game mainly uses a point and click system. Players do not control Takashi's movements directly, instead using a cursor to select points of interest in the game's environment. This control scheme is also used in some scenes that are similar to quick time events. A large portion of the game involves talking to other characters in the Yoshinodou household. While engaging a conversation, the player can use the cursor to highlight words in the text onscreen, which allows Takashi to further inquire about certain topics of discussion. Reception The game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens for a total of 29 out of 40.

Among Bob Ong's works, it is notable for being the first one to be a self- contained straightforward narrative rather than a collection of anecdotes. Bob Ong later came up with another book written as a straightforward narrative, MacArthur, but it is a very different work because it does not have Bob Ong's signature humorous tone. The story is about a little crab named \\"Tong\\" searching for a banana heart to cure his father from sickness. While he begins his journey he finds he and his friends also fight the evil animals in the forest. Alamat ng Gubat is notable for its allegorical references to Philippine society. Main characters * Tong - the main protagonist of the story. Tong is a small crab (talanka) who went to look for a banana blossom (heart of a banana) in the forest to cure his sickly father, Haring Talangka (translates to King Crab in English). He is engaged to a fish named Dalagang bukid. Tong is pinkish red and is the youngest in the pack of their crab family. Tong also has a brother called Katang who planned to take revenge on him at the middle of the story. His name is derived from the Visayan nursery rhyme Tong Tong Tong Pakitong-kitong, which is about crabs. * Pagong - a tortoise who is helping Tong in his adventure. He amazes Tong with his collection of turtle eggs. * Aso - a wild dog . He is a lost dog living in a forest (which he likes). He also helps Tong to find the banana heart, the whole forest will likely die. Aso has a spot on his left eye and is a little confused with everything he says. He also likes playing. * Kuneho - is mostly described as a Filipino version of Rabbit. He also joins Tong in his adventure in finding the banana heart. Kuneho is a little demanding on everything he says and is a little of always angry. He is tall and gray. * Buwaya - a crocodile who at the end, eats Tong's friends and Tong left behind. He announces Tong his \\"best friend\\". But Tong doesn't agree. Buwaya joins an evil gang in the forest which includes Leon, the gang leader, daga, and Maya, a small bird, who is also buwaya's sidekick and whose main job is to clean buwaya's teeth. * Daga - a rat living in the woods of Saging Republic. He is the tiny sidekick of Leon, Leon influenced Daga to Roar like lions and now, Daga is a part of the gang of evil animals in the forest. * Leon - a lion and is the leader and the founder of the evil packed gang. He influenced Tong's brother, Katang, in joining the evil gang of animals in the forest. Now, his gang is an obstacle to Tong's journey in finding the banana heart and saving his beloved father. * Maya - a sparrow which has his own mystery in the book : Good or Evil. Still, even at the end of the book, no one knows what side is he. He is Buwaya's sidekick but since his job is to clean Buwaya's teeth, he always ends up being eaten by the reptile although he manages to escape just in time. * Katang - the brother of Tong and decided to join the gang because of Tong. He is planning revenge for Tong because of Tong tricking him that getting defecated on an Adarna bird was good for his asthma. Now he has stolen Tong's is now part of the gang.

The disqualified boxer automatically loses the bout to the opponent. If both are disqualified, (termed a double disqualification) the result is usually declared a no contest regardless of round. Most disqualifications happen for repeated intentional fouling such as headbutting, low blows, rabbit punches, biting and the like. Typically, a referee will first verbally warn offenders or direct a point deduction first before disqualifying a boxer. However, contestants may be disqualified without warning for particularly egregious conduct such as kicking a downed opponent, hair pulling, or using loaded gloves. Secondly, violation of other rules by a fighter's corner, such as cornermen entering the ring or striking the opponent can result in disqualification even though such behavior is not strictly under the fighter's control. A boxer may also be disqualified if the referee deems that he or she is not fighting, or holding excessively. Disqualification occurs solely at the referee's discretion and no fouled contestant is automatically entitled to such a result.  Examples  A famous DQ in boxing occurred in the 1997 HolyfieldTyson II match, when Mike Tyson was disqualified in the 3rd round for repeatedly biting Evander Holyfield's ear.

He died in Bogot√° on 19 October 1894 while he was serving in Congress as senator. Carlos Holgu√≠n Mallarino was part of the prominent Holgu√≠n, Mallarino and Caro Families. Both his uncle Manuel Mar√≠a Mallarino and his brother, Jorge Holgu√≠n, were Presidents of Colombia, as was his brother-in-law Miguel Antonio Caro, who succeeded him in office.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 217, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 Early life Holgu√≠n completed his first years of education in the city of Cali, Valle. He then traveled to Bogot√°, where he studied jurisprudence and obtained a degree in law at the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom√© before his 20th birthday. His adoptive grandfather, an Englishman called Paterson Saunders, had taught him Latin, Greek, English, French and Italian. Holgu√≠n later became a great orator, debater, and writer. He was also a renowned journalist and professor of literature and history.  Military career  Holgu√≠n enlisted in the army and participated in several military actions like the uprising against President Jos√© Mar√≠a Melo, the war against Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, and the conservative revolt against Aquileo Parra in 1875.

At 23, he was elected as state senator representing the district of buenaventura and thereafter as President of the Cauca State Senate. Later he was elected several times to National Congress, representing the States of Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Tolima and Bol√≠var. Holgu√≠n was appointed also to several ministerial positions such as Minister of Foreign Relations, Interior and War. In 1881, while in Rome, Holgu√≠n was commissioned by President Rafael N√∫√±ez to establish diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Spain. By that time, Colombia was the only Latin American nation that did not have diplomatic relations with Spain.

From 1918 until 2006 the two states were united under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Serbia and Montenegro. There is controversy regarding the national identity of Montenegro due to recent political developments in the region. There is a debate on the ethnic identification of Montenegrins (whether they are Serbs or not), and the name of the national language (Montenegrin versus Serbian). Despite this, the countries have mostly friendly relations.

Serbs and Montenegrins composed 35% of the ethnic composition of Yugoslav Partisans in World War II.Ramet 1996, p. 153.

While often associated with graffiti art, Hambleton considered himself a conceptual artist who made both public art and gallery works. Early life Hambleton was born on June 23, 1952 in Tofino, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. He received an Advanced Diploma from the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver in 1975. Concomitantly Hambleton founded and became a co-director of Pumps Centre for Alternative Art, a gallery, performance and video space in Vancouver where he had is first solo exhibition in 1976 Art career =Street art= Hambleton's early public art included his Image Mass Murder art. From 1976 to 1978 Hambleton painted a police \\"chalk\\" outline around bodies of volunteer \\"homicide victims.\\" He then splashed some red paint on the outline, leaving behind a realistic looking crime scene. These \\"crime scenes\\" were done on the streets of 15 major cities across the United States and Canada. Like Hambleton's future \\"Shadowman\\" paintings, the Image Mass Murder \\"crime scenes\\" would often have the effect of startling or shocking passersby. =Shadowman paintings= In 1979 Hambleton moved permanently to the Lower East Side of New York. It was in New York that Hambleton gained notoriety for his \\"Shadowman\\" paintings of the early 1980s. Each painting resembles a life-sized silhouetted image of some mysterious person, a \\"splashy shadow figure.\\" These \\"shadow paintings\\" were splashed and brushed with black paint on hundreds of buildings and other structures across New York City. Locations were believed to be calculated for maximum impact upon unsuspecting pedestrians. Very often, a \\"Shadowman\\" could be found in a dark alley or lurking just around a street corner. Hambleton later expanded the scope of his project and painted these \\"shadowmen\\" in other cities, including Paris, London and Rome,Mallory Curley, A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia (2010), p. 208 and in 1984 he painted 17 life-size figures on the East side of the Berlin Wall, returning a year later to paint more figures on the West side of the wall. In 1983, during Malcolm McLaren's fashion design partnership with Vivienne Westwood, they collaborated with Hambleton to create a \\"Shadowman\\" jersey skirt. =Gallery works= After his public art, Hambleton produced a variation of his \\"shadow\\" work, showing his \\"Shadowman\\" as a sort of \\"rodeo man\\", or rugged \\"Marlboro Man\\", often riding a bucking horse. This series was painted on canvas and other materials, where they could be displayed as works of art. Inspired by the Marlboro (cigarette) magazine advertisements, which in some ways exploited the image of a uniquely \\"American hero\\" to sell its product, Hambleton appropriated and modified the image to create a new series of work. In the early nineties, Hambleton began to withdraw from the art scene. Many of his friends and collaborators, including Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, had died. Hambleton \\"became increasingly weary of the art business\\" and its impact on his artistic freedoms. In 2007, friend John Woodward helped revive his career through his first solo exhibition in over twenty years featuring the \\"Beautiful Paintings\\" at Woodward Gallery in NYC. With strong use of color, the \\"Beautiful Paintings\\" are very different from his \\"shadow\\" work. Hambleton stated that this work was a reaction against the abundance of figurative painting displayed in galleries at the time, to which he chose not include figurative work of his own. Hambleton said that he also intentionally sought out a different mood, \\"with a different sensibility,\\" from his previous work. Exhibitions During his career, Hambleton's works have been shown internationally, including paintings on canvas and paper of his \\"shadow\\" work. He was included in the Venice Biennale in 1984 and 1988. In 2009 from September 15, the works of Hambleton were displayed in an exhibition pertaining to 40-year career entitled, \\"Richard Hambleton - New York.\\" Thirty five pieces of Hambleton's work, spanning from the early 1980s to the present were exhibited, showing his \\"Shadowman\\" and \\"Marlboro Man\\" works on canvas (and other materials), presented side-by-side with his \\"Beautiful Paintings.\\" The exhibition toured to multiple venues that included the Moscow Museum of Modern Art. At the 2010 annual AIDS charity amfAR dinner party, held during the Cannes Film Festival, two of Hambleton's painting were auctioned for a combined $920,000.00, to help raise funds for AIDS research. Media mentions \\"Shadowman\\", a film about Hambleton by director Oren Jacoby, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21 2017. The film covers his meteoric rise to success in the New York art scene, as well as his widely reported struggle with drug addiction.https://www.filmjournal.com/features/offer-you-cant-refuse- godfather-reunion-caps-busy-tribeca-film-festival Death Hambleton died on October 29, 2017 of cancer at the age of 65.Haden-Guest, A., ‚ÄúRichard Hambleton: The Life and Death of a Downtown Art Star‚Äù, The Daily Beast, Nov 4, 2017.

It arises in the Nallamalla Hills, an offshoot of the Eastern Ghats. Its main headwaters lie some 6 kilometers from the village of Ardhaveedu, Prakasam District at an altitude of 425 m. above MSL.Google Earth Numerous mountain streams join it as it descends down the thickly forested hills through a series of curves and tight bends. It follows a north-easterly direction and enters the plains near Cumbum, after flowing through a town named after it. Gundlakamma is the largest of all the rivers that originate from the Nallamalla Hills. A 15th-century dam built by the Gajapati kings straddles the river on its entry into the plains. It is an earthen dam that plugs the river flows through. Called the Cumbum Dam, it is high, has a drainage area of and a capacity of . The river then flows past the town of Markapur and towards the Coromandel Coast through Addanki town. It finally enters the Bay of Bengal, some 19 km east of Ongole after having covered a distance of 225 km. Dams Apart from the ancient dam at Cumbum mentioned above, a modern dam called Gundlakamma Reservoir Project too has been constructed across the river at Mallavaram, Prakasam District. Some high, this dam has a capacity of and can irrigate of land. It will also provide drinking water for the 250,000 people living in Ongole and its surrounding hamlets. The lower part of the river basin is irrigated by Krishna river water through Nagarjuna Sagar right bank canal. Veligonda Project is under construction to connect the river basin with the adjacent Krishna River basin by a 20 km long tunnel from the Srisailam reservoir. Construction of a 40 Tmcft capacity storage reservoir is also part of this project. Once this project is completed, the reliability of water supply to all the irrigation projects in the river basin would enhance vastly. Bridges The Guntur-Guntakal railway track of the South Central Railway crosses the river over the embankment at Cumbum as well as at two other places before it. The Vijayawada-Chennai mainline of the same railway crosses the river a few kilometres before its mouth(Karavadi Village). Near the same place, National Highway 5 also spans the river at Vellampalli village. This is a seasonal river. Floods Though a tamed river generally, the heavy monsoonal rains in 2001 caused the river to burst its banks and flood areas along its course.

The Serbian foreign ministry responded by saying that Erdoƒüan's remarks \\"cannot be received as friendly,\\" and that the town of Prizren, where the speech was made, \\"is probably the least appropriate place for such statements\\" due to it being the initial burial place of Serbia's medieval emperor Du≈°an the Mighty.

However, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu said during an interview on the TRT channel that Erdoƒüan's words have been misunderstood. \\"Remarks which have been cut out from the whole speech were taken to grounds we don‚Äôt want. We also aim to have good relations with Serbia. Turkey maintains an equal distance to all Balkan countries,\\" Davutoƒülu stressed. =Post 2013 relations= Relations between two countries recovered quickly after 2013 speech with significant increase in number of flights travelers between Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport and Istanbul airports and entrance of Turkish companies such as Halkbank at Serbian market. In March 2016 in interview for the N 1 television, CNN International's regional broadcast partner and affiliate, Turkish ambassador in Belgrade Mehmet Kemal Bozaj stated that diplomacy of two countries have excellent cooperation regardless of different positions over the question of 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence while also stating that Turkey support Belgrade‚ÄìPristina negotiations. On the margins of 2016 Conference on Global Sustainable Transport in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan Minister of Mining and Energy of Serbia, Aleksandar Antiƒá stated that good relations between Serbia and Turkey contribute to the stability of the entire region. Minister also stated that reconstruction of A4 motorway will have direct positive effect on Turkey since the highway is used by Turkish citizens (especially truck drivers) who are traveling between their country and Central and Western Europe. During his meeting with his Turkish counterpart Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu in Ankara in October 2016, Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá stated that bilateral relations are crucial for the region and that Serbia proved to be Turkish friend during 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt when Belgrade explicitly at that same first night express opposition to any attempt of violent takeover and express support for the democratically elected government of Turkey. He also invited Turkish President and Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu to visit Belgrade. In December 2016 National Assembly of Serbia Deputy Speaker Vladimir Marinkoviƒá attended the opening of the renovated building of the Embassy of Turkey in Belgrade and on that occasion he stated that political relations between the two countries are very good. He expressed full support of all state institutions of Serbia to Turkey in the process of overcoming post 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt situation, and that Serbia want to see stable Turkey which is of great importance for the whole region.

She was hanged on 22 October 1894 at the age of 30. Needle was convicted for the murder of Louis Juncken, brother of her fianc√© Otto Juncken, on 15 May 1894. Although Needle collected substantial sums of insurance money, her exact motive for murdering her family has not been determined. Several times she stated her innocence, but she was eventually hanged. Early life Needle was born Martha Charles on the 9th of April 1863 in Morgan, South Australia; her father died when she was quite young. In 1870 her mother, Mary Charles, married Daniel Foran and had two more children. They were poor and lived in a small two room house in North Adelaide. Needle claimed that she was often beaten with a stick or rope by her step mother and, aged 13, she was indecently assaulted by her stepfather, Daniel Foran. Needle left home started work as a housekeeper at the age of 13, and married Henry Needle in 1882 at the age of 18. The marriage was happy and the couple had three children, Mabel, Elsie and May, before the family moved to the Melbourne suburb of Richmond in 1885. After the move the relationship between Needle and her husband deteriorated; Needle was an attractive woman and enjoyed the company of men, Henry Needle was a shy, jealous man who often beat her. The killings On 23 February 1885, little Mabel Needle died after a short illness. Martha stated that she \\"seemed to fade\\". Martha later collected 100 pounds (2010: $40,000) life insurance on Mabel's death. Henry, who was insured for 200 pounds, died of a mysterious illness on October 4, 1889, followed by Elsie in 1890 and May later that year. Doctors were baffled. Martha spent almost all the insurance money on an elaborate family grave which she visited regularly. Louis Juncken, a friend from Adelaide, operated a saddlery business with his brother Otto at 137 Bridge Road, Richmond and in 1891 Needle sub-let the attached house and took in lodgers. Needle began an affair with Otto in 1893 but Louis and his other brother Herman disapproved and attempted to prevent their engagement. The following year Louis became ill and died of suspected typhoid. In June 1894 Herman travelled to Melbourne from Adelaide to handle his late brother's affairs, he ate a meal prepared by Needle and suddenly became ill. He recovered but became ill again the next day after eating breakfast. Two days later Herman had fully recovered but while eating lunch, prepared by Needle, he was seized by painful violent cramps. Doctor Boyd treated Herman for suspected poisoning and took a sample of Herman's vomit and sent it to the Government laboratory for analysis. The analyst reported that the sample contained arsenic. Arrest, trial and execution Doctor Boyd informed the police of his suspicions and a trap was set, the police asked Herman to ask Needle to make lunch. After being served a cup of tea, Herman literally \\"blew the whistle\\", summoning detectives who arrived as Needle was struggling with Herman to upset the teacup, which was found to contain enough arsenic to kill five people. Needle was charged with attempted murder. The body of Louis Juncken, interred in Lyndoch, South Australia was exhumed and samples sent to Melbourne. The bodies of Henry Needle and the three girls, interred in Kew, were also exhumed. All five bodies were found to contain fatal levels of arsenic and Needle was charged with the murder of Louis Juncken. The trial lasted three days; Needle pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty and sentenced to death. During her time in gaol Needle received continued visits from her friends. In her final letter to friend, Mrs Owen, she writes \\"Try not to grieve too much for me.\\" She was executed at 8.00am on 22 October 1894. When asked for her last words, she replied, \\"I have nothing to say.\\" During the Great Depression the Brighton City Council built bluestone walls to protect local beaches from erosion. The stones were taken from the outer walls of the Old Melbourne Gaol and included the headstones, with initials and date of execution, of all those executed and buried on the grounds. Although most were placed with the engravings facing inwards, Needle's stone was faced outwards, and the initials MN and the date are still clearly visible in the Green Point wall. Over time, sand drifts buried her headstone until its precise location was rediscovered near Wellington Street. Needle was the third of four women hanged at the Old Melbourne Gaol, where her death mask can be seen. The others were Elizabeth Scott (1863), Frances Knorr (1894) and Emma Williams (1895). Execution of nephew On 15 July 1920, Alexander Newland Lee, the son of Needle's elder sister Ellen, was hanged at Adelaide Gaol for the April 1 murder of his wife Muriel. Muriel had been poisoned with strychnine.

Early life and education  Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, MacLennan is the daughter of a Canadian father and an American mother. She earned a degree from Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario.  Professional career  MacLennan originally had planned to pursue a career in print journalism but switched to broadcasting after a college internship at CJOH-TV in Ottawa, Ontario. MacLennan co-anchored Canada AM on CTV from 1985 to 1987. In 1986, MacLennan was struck by a policeman on a motorcycle in Toronto and developed a blood clot on the brain. After doctors failed in their efforts to dissolve the blood clot with drugs, they operated on her at substantial risk to her. She eventually made a full recovery. In March 1987, MacLennan left CTV to join WBBM-TV in Chicago as a reporter and late afternoon co-anchor. In April 1989, MacLennan became WBBM-TV's 10 p.m. co-anchor, replacing Walter Jacobson in the anchor chair alongside Bill Kurtis. Jacobson had been the station's 10 p.m. co-anchor since 1973. In 1995, Kurtis stepped down as WBBM's 10 p.m. co-anchor, and Lester Holt was promoted to replace Kurtis alongside MacLennan. In 1996, MacLennan appeared on the pilot episode of Early Edition as a newscaster. In February 2000, MacLennan was demoted as WBBM's 10 p.m. co- anchor as both she and Holt were demoted in favor of a solo anchor experiment involving Carol Marin. After station bosses pulled the plug on Marin as solo anchor in October 2000, WBBM then made MacLennan an interim 10 p.m. co-anchor, alongside David Kerley. However, in December 2000, WBBM hired Tracy Townsend as a 10 p.m. co-anchor alongside Kerley, and MacLennan shifted to being a solo 11 a.m. news anchor (replacing Jay Levine and Mary Ann Childers) and a 4:30 p.m. co-anchor alongside Vince Gerasole.

Services Junee is served by two daily NSW TrainLink XPT services in each direction operating between Sydney and Melbourne, and a twice weekly NSW TrainLink Xplorer between Griffith and Sydney split from Canberrra services at Goulburn.  History  The station c.1882 Junee station opened on 6 July 1878 when the Main South line was extended from Bethungra. It served as the terminus until the line was extended to Bomen on 3 September 1878. It was renamed Junee Junction on 28 February 1881 when the Hay line opened as far as Narrandera, before resuming its original name in April 1940.Junee Station NSWrail.netJunee Railway Precinct NSW Environment & Heritage A timber station building was constructed, and in 1881 the branch line to Narrandera from Junee Junction was opened. Over the next few years, many new branchlines were opened in the south west areas, and Junee henceforth became a major rail centre of the region and of New South Wales, with railway workshops having been moved to the town from Wagga. Junee developed rapidly during the 1880s as a result of its status as an important rail town. The arrival of the railway in Junee took place during the first main phase of railway building (1854‚Äì88) in the colony. The original station building burned down in January 1882. Plans for a new building (the present station) were approved on 21 February 1883 and the station was opened by MLA Joseph Palmer Abbott on 5 March 1885; the station (including refreshment rooms) cost ¬£3,434. The station building was constructed under the direction of John Whitton, Chief Engineer of the New South Wales Government Railways.NTA, 1976 In January 1947 a 42 road, fully covered roundhouse was completed.

Italianate building in the Ritz style, built in 1883 under the direction of John Whitton, Chief Engineer of the N.S.W.G.R. Symmetrically designed, the single storey low central section has its roof concealed by a parapet and is flanked either side by square pavilions having mansard curved roofs. Walls are face brick* and stucco with cast iron entrance verandah and platform canopy. Tuckpointed Flemish bond. The Junee station building is an interesting building architecturally for its Victorian Free Classical style incorporates French Second Empire characteristics in the form of mansard roofs. The single storey building is constructed of face brick, with stucco decoration. It is symmetrical with a low, parapet roof; round or segmented pediments are centrally located on the parapet on the street and platform sides. The cornice beneath the parapet has paired brackets. At each end of the station there is a square pavilion with a mansard roof and a facet bay to the street side. An iron entrance verandah runs between the two pavilions on the street facade. There is stucco decoration to window surrounds, including label moulds. A long, iron verandah runs along the platform and the posts have decorative brackets; there is decorative iron work in the ends of the verandah roof. The station's chimneys are rendered. Simple stuccoed quoins are found on the building's corners. At one end of the station there is a small building of similar style and construction. The railway station is a key element in the streetscape of this part of Junee. Together with the large hotels and other buildings nearby, the station plays an important role in creating the historic qualities of central Junee. The Station complex (in a 1944 photograph) included a garden room developed in the spaces between railway structures and buildings. Junee's was formally structured, with a central fountain and pond, circular path around it, perimeter paths, lawn and formal arrangement of flower beds cut into the lawn.Longworth, 2012, 7 = Locomotive Depot / Roundhouse = As built, the roundhouse and turntable arrangement at Junee consisted of a forty-two road roundhouse laid out in a radial pattern, from a central turntable. (This is a typical arrangement for roads laid out in a roundhouse). In addition, two roads allowed for arrival and departure of locomotives from the roundhouse roads. The extant roundhouse building at Junee is circular in form, providing cover over 42 roads (1-42), with the remaining two roads, (the access/egress roads) being uncovered. It is of interest to note that each \\"half\\" of the roundhouse (i.e. the sector on either side of the arrival and departure roads) are of slightly different dimensions, to suit differing sizes in motive power. The inspection pits within each \\"half\\" are of different lengths to suit the different motive power. Principal Dimensions Length of side wall (i.e. from front doorway to rear wall of roundhouse) : 67 feet (west-side shed) and 82 feet (east-side shed). Approx. outside diameter of circle scribed by roundhouse : 400 feet The principal construction features include a peaked roof formed by interior roof trusses with a ventilating ridge mounted on the peak of the roof. The roof is actually two symmetrically sloped roof sections. As built, smoke chutes above each shed road (forty-two in total) were provided, extending through the roof, mounted in the sloping roof section closest to the outer wall of the building. These were used for venting smoke to atmosphere from within the building. With the arrival of the diesel- electric locomotives, some of these chutes were removed or modified. Principal construction materials are brick with roof trusses supported on concrete columns. Timber beams and trusses with steel bracing and straps are also used in construction. Flooring is concrete. Windows / translucent sheeting is provided in sections of the rear or outer wall to assist with natural lighting. Inspection pits and steps are provided on each road. (Some of the original construction materials and features have had minor changes and improvements during the 80 year life of the building). Other equipment associated with the locomotive roundhouse and depot includes a 100-foot diameter electrically operated turntable (the only one in the state), a machine shop, a store and amenities building, and a number of administrative buildings. = Moveable Heritage = The moveable heritage at Junee is considered significant such that it has its own heritage listing separate to that of the station complex. The listing includes: On the platforms: * all station signage, the blue timber platform benches with incised \\"Junee\\" lettering, the double-sided Timetic electric clock suspended under platform canopy, the gooseneck platform lamp posts, the bell and chain under the canopy, the wall-mounted carriage lamps, the cast iron stormwater grates, the original and early door and window hardware (locks, handles, sash locks and lifts etc.), the Semaphore signal in yard, the three Countrylink luggage trolleys, large circular concrete planter pots In the platform building and offices: * the fitted timber waiting room benches, original and early light fittings, switches, chains and timber mounting blocks, cast iron and concrete door thresholds and boot scrapers, timber surrounds and cast iron grates, the bevelled mirror with moulded timber frame, large four-panel Victorian timber doors in storage, steel trolley in storage, timber pigeonhole shelving, timber desk with turned legs and drawers, square timber desk with turned legs, possibly cedar, large desk with drawers, s, open timber desk shelving, luggage scales, red Ajax safe Junee Railway Refreshment Room, 1950 In the Refreshment Rooms: * the large wall mirrors, framed prints, cupboards and cabinets, curved timber bar and cabinetry, galvanised bucket, signal lamps, \\"Safety Notices\\" cabinet, framed prints, illuminated sign \\"Counter meal services\\", Bakelite speaker on wall, cast iron urn and plinth, cast iron stove /range - J Ward Ltd Sydney - in kitchen, blackboards in storage, fitted timber racking in kitchen, circular coat hooks in storage, wardrobe / cabinet s, timber screen panel doors in storage, timber pigeonhole cabinet, and a cast iron piece of machinery of unknown function = Condition = The building was in constant government service for more than 45 years, followed by 9 years of service as a railway heritage collection centre and private railway operator's maintenance depot. Consequently, some sections of the structure show signs of minor wear and tear. Apart from some minor deterioration and alterations carried out as the form of motive power changed, and the local heritage group occupied the premises, the building and other equipment is in reasonably good condition, both internally and externally. Externally, the building retains its typical railway appearance. Even though its original purpose (the servicing of steam locomotives) has been altered to suit newer motive power, with a subsequent change to work methods and equipment, the integrity of the roundhouse has been retained. Internally, the building retains a high degree of integrity due to the retention of original construction features and details.  Heritage listing  Junee railway station was one of the principal locomotive servicing and maintenance depots for steam locomotives (later diesel-electric locomotives and diesel rail cars) in use in the far southern region of the state, including those locomotives in use on the mainline and branchlines in the area. Those branchlines included the Junee-Narrandera area and all branches radiating from there, and the numerous branches which junction with the main southern line between Wagga Wagga and Albury. The 42-road roundhouse was completed in the late 1940s period. Junee roundhouse was the largest complete roundhouse building in the state, and the locomotive depot serviced, repaired and maintained the largest steam motive power in use in the state for more than 25 years. The depot remained in government service for approximately 46 years. Many major components of important railway centres and work precincts have been demolished or otherwise removed or substantially modified and as a consequence, their past use can no longer be shown. In the 1940s, through to the 1950s period (arguably the pinnacle of steam locomotive operations in the state), the railway precinct at Junee consisted of a large railway station, a relatively large and important shunting yard, a Train Control Centre, two large signal boxes, junction arrangements for the Junee- Narrandera-Hay-Griffith branchline and a relatively modern locomotive depot. The depot comprised a roundhouse, large elevated coal bunker (for fuelling steam locomotives), boiler wash-out plant, ash handling arrangements, large and modern machine shop and a substantial amount of equipment essential for the rapid and efficient servicing and repair of the steam locomotives working in the district. In recent years, the large marshalling yard, although essentially intact is used for stowing train loads, rather than the original function of re-marshalling trains. In addition, a number of the significant items of equipment installed at the locomotive depot have been removed or demolished, mostly associated with the removal of steam locomotives from service and the then increasing use of diesel-electric locomotives. The roundhouse and some of the other items associated with the depot remain in situ and are in remarkably good condition. Deleted items include the coal bunker, de-ashing arrangement, hot water boiler wash-out plant and a number of small buildings. The roundhouse at Junee represents a good example of a once busy and extremely large and significant locomotive servicing centre. The extant building, which represents the Junee locomotive depot precinct is assessed as having state significance. Junee railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The historic value of the locomotive roundhouse and turntable at Junee should be considered in a statewide context. The items are historically significant because they represent part of a fine example of an important locomotive depot, the principal repair, locomotive service and maintenance facility for the far southern region of the state. The depot, its servicing facilities and the men who worked there were responsible for provision of reliable mainline and branch line locomotives operating on the main southern line and on the lengthy branchlines. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Junee roundhouse is (was) part of a statewide network of locomotive servicing centres which comprises buildings of this style (i.e. roundhouses), buildings incorporating straight engine sheds or open areas where locomotives were repaired or stabled. Most of these centres have been removed from railway service, but this roundhouse and the other equipment shows the link between trains, local industry, engineering capacity, handling of mainline and branchline passenger and goods services and local employment. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A railway precinct such as Junee, complete with passenger station, locomotive depot and equipment, marshalling yard and other railway facilities immediately gives the appearance of intense activities in all weathers. Much of the evidence of the past activities at Junee has been deleted, but there are a number of representative and significant structures extant. The item is aesthetically significant because the original fabric and architectural features of the 1940s built roundhouse are intact. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Railway stations, signal boxes, shunting yards and locomotive depots represent a place of work in both railway employment terms and state employment terms. The \\"railways\\" were for many years, the largest employer in NSW, with staff in all corners of the state in numerous positions. The railways were (and still are) a 24-hour / day, seven day / week operation and staff were employed to maintain that position. The roundhouse, turntable and other structures which comprise Junee locomotive depot are socially significant because they are excellent representations of a source of much employment in the southern highlands region of the state. The wages for these employees added to the local prosperity. In addition, the success of local business resulted from their ability and opportunity to supply the local railway establishments with goods and services. Large and busy railway facilities in town usually meant success and prosperity for the locality. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Junee locomotive depot with the roundhouse, turntable and other railway buildings represent a past era. The precinct illustrates an era where large scale transport of passengers and goods by rail was commonplace. The roundhouse and other equipment were essential for these intense rail activities, involving passenger and goods, in an age when trains were the principal means of transport for the population. The items are technically and research significant because the roundhouse and its equipment are the remnants of a past era, located in an area of the state where railway played so much a part in development and essential transport, both interstate and intrastate. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Steam locomotives were the principal form of railway motive power in New South Wales for approximately 110 years (1855-1965). As such, steam locomotive servicing facilities incorporating engine sheds or roundhouse were established at approximately 150 sites in the state. It is also estimated that 120 straight engine sheds and 25 roundhouses were also built, all there buildings being part of statewide locomotive servicing arrangements. By the year 2002, only four engine sheds remain in the state, and nine roundhouses (or part roundhouses) are extant. The Junee roundhouse is assessed as being a rare and endangered example of the state's historical and cultural environment. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The basic shape and form of railway roundhouses are similar - a circular or part circular building containing railway tracks arranges radially (fan shaped) around a centrally placed turntable. There were differences in design of roundhouse buildings, mainly associated with roof shape, numbers of roads enclosed, location of windows and construction materials. Demolition and removal of many roundhouses (16) and most engine sheds has resulted in the loss of many features of these railway buildings. Junee roundhouse represents a class of industrial building which has almost disappeared from the state.

Cootamundra railway station is located on the Main South line in New South Wales, Australia. It serves the town of Cootamundra. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Cootamundra station opened on 1 November 1877 when the Main South line was extended from Harden-Murrumburrah. It served as the terminus until the line was extended to Bethungra on 15 April 1878.Cootamundra Station NSWrail.netCootamundra Railway Precinct NSW Environment & Heritage On 1 June 1886, Cootamundra became a junction station when the Tumut & Kunama line opened as far as Gundagai. On 1 September 1893, the Lake Cargelligo line opened as far as Temora. In 1901, an island platform was built, this has since closed but remains in situ. In 1943, the line through Cootamundra was duplicated with the largest overhead signal gantry in the Southern Hemisphere was erected. It has since been relocated and now stands preserved in the station surrounds. The Lachlan Valley Railway has a base immediately south of the depot.  Description  The station building is a type 5, first-class brick station originally dating from 1884 with alterations in 1904‚Äì05, 1915 and 1943. The platforms are faced in brick. A refreshment room sits on the up platform, dating from 1890 with 1904 additions. The branch platform has an additional awning at the Sydney end, which is considered particularly fine. The complex also include a fibrous cement clad flat roofed signal box (1942), railway barracks (1932) and a type 3 gatekeeper's residence located in Cowcumba Street. The level crossing, steel pedestrian footbridge at south end, turntable, triangle junction and the station's trees, signs and lights are also heritage-listed. Services Cootamundra is served by two daily NSW TrainLink XPT services in each direction operating between Sydney and Melbourne, and a twice weekly NSW TrainLink Xplorer between Griffith and Sydney split from Canberrra services at Goulburn. NSW TrainLink also operate road coach services from Cootamundra to Mildura, Tumbarumba, Queanbeyan, Bathurst, Dubbo and Condobolin.  Heritage listing  Cootamundra is a major railway complex with a variety of buildings and an unusually designed first class station building not seen elsewhere. It is of significance both in the townscape and in the development of railways. The railway yard extending for almost the length of the town along its eastern boundary is a major element in the development of the town and the station buildings are at the terminus of one of the main streets in the town. The station building and its major platform awning are of particular significance with very fine detail in both the building and the cast iron columns and brackets of the canopy. The station building has been substantially altered over its history and is an excellent example of the development of a major facility and the homogenous way in which buildings can grow. Of particular interest is the marking of the station entry with a tower over the entry vestibule. Another important feature of the site is the particularly fine awning to the branch platform with extensive use of cast iron panels and columns. This is one of the finest such awnings in the State. The other elements of the site contribute to the understanding of it and illustrate how a major railway centre operated and was developed. The site also contains a number of mature trees that provide a pleasant setting for the complex. Cootamundra railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.

Life Born into a Swabian family of craftsmen, Kistler attended the Lehrerseminar (Teacher seminar) in Lauingen (Swabia) from 1864 to 1867. Subsequently, he firstly worked as a teacher at various places in Middle Swabia. However, when he was no longer content with this way of making a living, he, instead, concentrated merely on making and composing music. From 1876 to 1878, he was a student at the K√∂nigliche Musikschule (Royal Music School) in Munich in the subjects organ and composition; one of his teachers was Josef Rheinberger. Afterwards, in 1883, he took over the position of a teacher for Music theory at the F√ºrstliches Konservatorium (Baronial Academy of Music) at Sondershausen. In 1876, he got to know Richard Wagner at Bayreuth, whose work exerted a deep influence on Kistler. From 1884 on, he worked at Bad Kissingen in Lower Franconia, where he founded an own music school. From 1880 on, he published the music journal ‚ÄûMusikalische Tagesfragen. Organ f√ºr Musiker, Musikfreunde und Freunde der Wahrheit‚Äú (‚ÄûCurrent questions on music. An organ for musicians, friends of music and friends of truth‚Äú). The journal existed for a period of 12 years, with periods of interruptions due to Kistler's health problems in between. Kistler composed operas (for instance ‚ÄûBaldurs Tod‚Äú, ‚ÄûDie Kleinst√§dter‚Äú, ‚ÄûKunihild‚Äú, ‚ÄûDer Schmied von Kochel‚Äú und ‚ÄûEulenspiegel‚Äú), secular and clerical choral works, songs, and pieces for organ and piano. In 1904, Kistler published his harmonics ‚ÄûDer einfache Kontrapunkt und die einfache Fuge‚Äú (‚ÄûThe Simple Counterpoint and the Simple Fugue‚Äú). In his lifetime, Kistler became very well known through his work and by writing more than 200 works. He was placed on a par with Richard Strauss and, in a certain way, was in competition with him. When Kistler premiered his opera ‚ÄûEulenspiegel‚Äú at W√ºrzburg in 1889, Richard Strauss, though, regarded the libretto of the opera to be ‚Äûclumsy‚Äú and ‚Äûamusing‚Äú. Instead, he used the opera as an opportunity to write his own Symphonic poem ‚ÄûTill Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks‚Äú a few years later, which had far more success. Richard Wagner described his friend Cyrill Kistler as his only dignified successor. Kistler's former teacher Josef Rheinberger dedicated his work ‚ÄûDe profundis‚Äú, which he had written on April 22, 1881, to his former student Kistler with the handwritten dedication on it: ‚ÄûHerrn Cyrill Kistler zu freundl.

It serves the town of Harden. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The station c.1889 Harden station opened on 12 March 1877 as Murrumburrah when the Main South line was extended from Binalong. It served as the terminus until the line was extended to Cootamundra on 1 November 1877. It was renamed North Murrumburrah on 5 September 1878 and finally Harden on 1 September 1880. In 1914, the platform was converted to an island platform as part of the duplication of the line.Harden Station NSWrail.netHarden Railway Precinct NSW Environment & Heritage In 1885, Harden became a junction station with the opening of the Blayney-Demondrille line as far as Young, ultimately reaching Blayney in 1888. Although it branched off the Main South line six kilometres south of the station at Demondrille, Harden was the terminus for many services and became an important railway town gaining a locomotive depot that lasted until the late 1960s. A CPH railmotor connected with the Riverina Express and South Mail until replaced by a road coach in November 1983.\\"The New Timetable Reviewed\\" Railway Digest April 1984 page 107 Until the closure of the Blayney-Demondrille line in August 2009, Harden was a popular destination for Lachlan Valley Railway steam locomotive hauled trains from Cowra with an operational turntable maintained. Services Harden is served by two daily NSW TrainLink XPT services in each direction operating between Sydney and Melbourne, and a twice weekly NSW TrainLink Xplorer between Griffith and Sydney split from Canberrra services at Goulburn. NSW TrainLink also operate a road coach service from Queanbeyan to Cootamundra via Harden station. This station is a request stop for the Melbourne XPT & the Sydney- bound Griffith Xplorer, so these services stop only if passengers booked to board/alight here.  Description  The station consists of a second-class brick station building of a type 3 design and brick platforms, dating from 1877 with alterations in 1881 and 1919, two-storey refreshment rooms dating from 1884, a signal box with a hip roof dating from 1912, and the stationmaster's residence located at 51 Whitton Street. Remains of the former engine shed, turntable and coal stage support are included in the station's heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Harden is a good example of a substantial station building and refreshment room complex that was designed for single line operation and converted to double track operation by adding a rear platform to the original street frontage and providing a subway to gain access to the station. The station has undergone a number of alterations, retains its early form and exhibits clearly the changes that have taken place. The signal boxes are excellent examples of large boxes from a major depot, most the facilities of which have now been removed. They demonstrate two varying style of construction. The remains of the former engine depot are reminders when Harden was a major engine servicing and changing station from the 1880s until replaced by Demondrille in 1922. Harden railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare.

He is scheduled to be released from FCI Sandstone on October 26, 2026. On May 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to eight charges of fraud, which included one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, one count of money laundering, one count of securities fraud, and five counts of wire fraud in a scheme to sell more than $950 million in fictitious promissory notes. Civil charges, filed in December 2008 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are pending. The 2011 documentary Unraveled states that \\"Drier stole over $740 million from 4 clients, 4 individuals, and 13 hedge funds\\". He is the sole equity partner of the dissolved law firm Dreier, LLP. After being suspended from the New York Bar on December 23, 2008, the New York Supreme Court formally disbarred Dreier on October 8, 2009, effective nunc pro tunc to May 11, 2009. He had been admitted on May 5, 1976. Early life, education, and career milestones Marc Dreier grew up on the south shore of Long Island in an affluent area known as the Five Towns. His father, a Jewish war refugee from Poland, owned a chain of movie theaters. Dreier presided over the Lawrence High School student council, and graduated \\"most likely to succeed\\". He graduated from Yale University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts and earned a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1975. He began his career as a \\"shining star\\" in the late 1970s at Rosenman & Colin, Freund, Lewis & Cohen, then a 90-lawyer litigation firm, and was well regarded. \\"He was a very smart, hard-working guy....Funny, personable ‚Äì part of the social mix\\", but what most distinguished him was his ability to think on his feet. \\"He's very quick. Very smart.\\" In the early 1980s, Dreier was named a partner at Rosenman. In 1987, he married a Rosenman associate named Elisa Peters. He and his wife separated in 2000, around the time that Dreier broke with a partner and started his own firm. His wife filed for divorce in January 2002. Dreier has since stated that only he was to blame, saying, \\"I wasn‚Äôt attentive enough to my family.\\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/11/marc-dreier200911 In 1989, he joined the New York office of Fulbright & Jaworski. Dreier would become co- head of litigation in New York, but when Dreier left Fulbright in March 1995, there were only ten New York litigators. He then worked for Duker & Barrett for less than two years. Its founding partner, William Duker, would later plead guilty to four counts of fraud called \\"one of the most serious cases of legal fraud\\" ever prosecuted. In 1996, he teamed with a Florida lawyer named Neil Baritz, who had a small corporate and securities practice, to found a firm called Dreier & Baritz. Though he was able to found the firm, a precursor to Dreier LLP, he struggled to distinguish his practice. From 1999 to 2002, Dreier, Baritz, & Federman was formed with offices in New York and Boca Raton with most associates in Oklahoma. Dreier ran the new firm's already leased Park Avenue office. He favored plaintiff class-action lawsuits, which brought in large revenue. Federman had problems with Dreier's spending, managerial style, and secrecy, which culminated in a lawsuit. Dreier, pushing to impress, acquired expensive trappings, buying a house in Westhampton. He bought first a place in Quogue, then the house next door. He purchased the $18 million yacht Seascape, which included a crew of 10 and a Jacuzzi, and docked it in New York City and St. Martin. Dreier owned a waterfront home in the Hamptons, a Manhattan triplex, and a penthouse on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California, which he leased out. He drove a Mercedes 500 in New York and an Aston Martin in California. He was a member of the Harmonie Club and maintained a high profile at charity events. Dreier LLP In 2006, Dreier founded his own firm with offices in five cities, promising lavish compensation. The headquarters at 499 Park Avenue had $30 million to $40 million worth of art, including works by Picasso and a Warhol depiction of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Dreier operated like a corporation and not like a partnership. Marc Dreier was the sole equity partner owner, controlled all of the firm's finances, and handled all administrative functions. There was no executive committee and no partners meetings. All deals were structured so that only he knew all the specifics and had access to all accounts. Dreier convinced lawyers that such an arrangement was best by emphasizing that it would allow them to concentrate on law while he worried about running the firm. He hired lawyers on three-year contracts, fixing their salaries and paying bonuses based on the fees each lawyer brought in. According to court filings, some lawyers received more than $50,000 in salary every two weeks. In 2007, Dreier expanded to Los Angeles and brought in Hollywood superstar lawyer Stanton \\"Larry\\" Stein, whose clients included Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen and Hilary Duff. The expansion boosted Dreier LLP's revenue from $60 million in 2006 to $90 million in 2007. Despite the burgeoning volume of business, the office actually operated at a net loss of approximately one million dollars a month. On January 27, 2009, Paul S. Anik, a partner at Dreier Stein Kahan Browne Woods George, LLP died from a sudden stress-related heart attack at 54. On September 28, 2008, New York Magazine stated that 20 attorneys of the firm and its affiliates were selected for inclusion in \\"New York Super Lawyers, 2008 Edition\\" by Law & Politics, the legal publisher and independent researcher of multiple nationwide surveys. In 2007, 16 attorneys were named. Dreier's two children were on his payroll, and he spent $10 million of the firm's money at New York's Gagosian Gallery in 2008. In March 2009, the law firm Fox Rothschild acquired Pastore Osterberg, a firm in Stamford, Connecticut that was founded by Dreier attorneys in late 2008. Joe Pastore and Eric Osterberg joined along with seven other Dreier attorneys. The practice focused on litigation, telecommunications, technology, securities, and intellectual property. =Traub Bonacquist & Fox= In September 2006, Dreier acquired a well-known bankruptcy law firm Traub, Bonacquist & Fox. Founding member and managing partner Paul Traub participated in several of the largest retail bankruptcies in previous years, including Kmart, FAO Schwarz Inc., KB Toys Inc., Stage Stores, Office Max, and eToys.com. During his legal career, Traub has had his own ethical controversies, especially conflict of interest issues which continue to shadow him. Alt URL Traub became a Dreier partner, earning in the range of $1 million or more, and was co-chair, with Norman Kinel, of the bankruptcy practice. On December 5, 2007, Traub sent a letter to clients announcing that he and other bankruptcy lawyers had resigned from the firm, but would continue to practice together as their former partnership, Traub, Bonacquist & Fox LLP. \\"In light of recent developments, of which we were unaware until yesterday, we have resigned from Dreier LLP, effective immediately\\", the letter states. In February 2009, Epstein, Becker & Green, a firm specializing in government contracts, brought the seven-member Traub/Dreier bankruptcy team into their New York office, which included Paul Traub, Steven E. Fox, Wendy G. Marcari, and Maura I. Russell. Associates included Brett J. Nizzo, Anthony B. Stumbo, and Bradford Tobin. The firm has 400 attorneys based in eleven US cities. , Harold F. Bonacquist, a passive partner, is a political attach√© at the United States Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. =Sheldon Solow= From 1998 to 2006, Dreier handled much litigation for Sheldon Solow, a billionaire real estate dealmaker. The most recent case was the unsuccessful eviction of Bank of America Securities LLC from his flagship Manhattan building, 9 West 57th St., on the dubious grounds that one of the bank's brokers had been accused of illegal trading. In 2000, Solow decided to litigate for ownership of a $10 million oceanfront house in East Hampton. Peter Morton, co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain, had signed a contract to purchase the home from Dr. Gary Feldstein. Solow tried to break their contract and buy the place himself. Years of litigation ensued. Dreier filed suits in state courts in Manhattan and Suffolk County, in federal court in both the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, in bankruptcy court in Florida, and in several corresponding appellate courts. \\"He had a certain glibness, this certainty that he could get away with that which other lawyers couldn't\\", says Feldstein's lawyer, Kevin Smith, whom Dreier named as a defendant in one of the suits. \\"He was like Gatsby without the charm.\\" In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, citing their \\"extensive history of persistent, repetitive, and vexatious litigation\\", ordered Solow and Dreier to pay double costs to Morton and Feldstein. The litigation cost Solow an estimated $6 million in legal fees, much of it going to Dreier. In February 2004, advertisements labeled \\"legal notices\\" ran in The New York Times and the New York Post. The bogus ads, a costly embarrassment, informed \\"all unsecured creditors\\" in developer Peter Kalikow's 1994 Chapter 11 reorganization that they \\"might have additional rights of recovery\\" because of Kalikow's failure \\"to make truthful disclosure\\". More than 50 calls and 18 faxes came in to the Evergence Capital Advisors, Inc., by creditors. Evergence was a defunct Florida corporation run by Kosta Kovachev, a Belgrade-born, one- time Morgan Stanley broker facing SEC charges for his participation in a $20 million Ponzi scheme, for which he ultimately paid the SEC $358,148 in penalties and interest. The Evergence phone and fax numbers went directly to telephone lines at 499 Park Ave. ‚Äì the offices of Dreier, LLP. It was Dreier who had purchased the newspaper ads, using Evergence and Kovachev as a front. After Manhattan federal bankruptcy court Judge Burton Lifland, who oversaw Kalikow's bankruptcy and presided in the Madoff Investment Scandal bankruptcy, ordered Dreier to disclose his client's identity, it became clear that Solow had hired Dreier to place the ads. Lifland ordered Dreier and Solow to pay about $300,000 in sanctions to Kalikow. In November 2008, Dreier claimed that Solow was looking to raise $500 million by selling short-term, high-interest notes, which were supported by an audit report that Dreier had forged. The report had been used to try to dupe a hedge fund, Whippoorwill Associates, into buying bogus Solow Realty promissory notes. On October 15, fund managers, who had bought $115 million of the notes in 2006 or 2007, demanded a meeting at Solow's offices when they weren't repaid on schedule. Dreier arranged it, with Kovachev posing as Solow's CEO. In October 2008, Dreier sent a Connecticut hedge fund's managing director documents that he said were Solow's audited financial statements, and the fund bought a forged $25 million note for $13.5 million. Dreier sent a New York hedge fund the same documents he'd given the Connecticut fund, but portfolio managers wanted more information. Dreier forwarded four e-mails that purported to be from other funds that had purchased Solow notes, as well as a Dreier LLP opinion letter vouching for the notes. A portfolio manager subsequently asked to speak directly to someone at Solow Realty. Dreier scheduled a conference call for October 23, and provided a telephone number located in the conference room at Dreier LLP's offices in Stamford, Connecticut. Kovachev got on the phone and, pretending to be Solow CEO Steven Cherniak, answered questions about the notes and Solow's finances. The next day the hedge fund bought about $100 million in notes. Both the Connecticut and New York funds were dubious and brought their doubts to Solow Realty and its audit firm. In November, one hedge fund manager told Dreier that he'd called Solow Realty and copied him on an e-mail to Solow about the notes. Solow's attorneys subsequently contacted federal authorities, that Dreier might be engaged in financial fraud. =Client list= More than 200 creditors have filed a total of more than $450 million in claims.

Ex-law partner Bruce F. Bronster is seeking $767,000 and entertainment attorney Lisa Bonner is claiming $448,365. More than 800 pages of clients were named as \\"creditors holding unsecured non-priority claims\\" and were filed in a New York court. Some of these clients include Bill Cosby, Tim Burton, Justin Timberlake, the music groups the Virgins, the Dead Trees and the Black Angels, production company Monkey Dog Music, Harry Connick, Jr., Elvis Costello, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, 50 Cent, Echo & the Bunnymen and companies representing the Doors, the B-52's, and the Ramones. Sports figures include baseball players Andy Pettitte and Sammy Sosa, tennis star Maria Sharapova, and hockey player Kevin Weekes. Sports teams Manchester United F.C., the New York Mets, and the Major League Baseball Players Association were also among the clients. In March 2008, Dreier sued client Judith Regan, claiming she owed the firm fees in connection with her $100 million defamation and breach of contract suit against her former employer, News Corp.'s HarperCollins Publishers LLC. On December 9, 2008, Regan claimed Dreier tried to extort a settlement from her and improperly disclosed her $10.75 million settlement with HarperCollins. Criminal fraud case =Sentence and guilty plea= On July 13, 2009, Dreier was sentenced to 20 years and ordered to begin his term immediately. Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected the prosecutors' request of a maximum responding, \\"he is not Mr. (Bernard) Madoff from any analysis, and that's why I can't understand why the government is asking for 145 years\\". Dreier addressed the court, his family, his clients, and the lawyers who worked for him: \\"I'm sorry, deeply sorry, for the harm and the sadness that I have caused to so many people.\\" The U.S. Probation Department had recommended a sentence of 25 years. In a letter to the court, Dreier wrote: \\"I recall only that I was desperate for some measure of the success that I felt had eluded me. I lost my perspective and my moral grounding, and really, in a sense, I just lost my mind.\\" At his plea hearing on May 11, 2009, Dreier read a statement, \\"I engineered a scheme to issue and sell fictitious promissory notes purportedly issued by companies in the United States and Canada\\", and subsequently pleaded guilty of swindling $380M USD from various hedge funds by selling worthless financial instruments without any plea agreement with the government. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has also filed a separate civil suit against him for stealing funds from an escrow account belonging to one of the firm's bankruptcy clients. An amended indictment on March 17, 2009 added an eighth count of money laundering to the charges and $700 million in forfeitures. From 2004 to December 2008, Dreier \\"sold to funds and others approximately $700 million worth of Fake Developer Notes and Fake Pension Plan Notes\\". The case number is: S1 09Cr085. The eight-count indictment states his deception began in 2004, that Dreier gave the purchasers of his notes false financial statements, arranged meetings for investors with people who impersonated officials from purported issuers of the notes, sold fake promissory notes purportedly issued by a Canadian pension plan, and embezzled more than $400 million from his client escrow account. Dreier may also be facing criminal charges in Canada for impersonating an in-house lawyer at the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in connection with an attempted sale of financial instruments worth $44.7 million USD, for which he was arrested. He was released on bail, only to be arrested again by U.S. authorities upon returning to New York. =Free on bail= At his plea hearing on May 11, 2009, Judge Rakoff said, \\"He has disgraced the honorable profession of law... There are 100 good reasons why Mr. Dreier should be jailed. By his own admission here today, he has shown that he is to be ranked with those who have committed some of the most egregious frauds in history.\\" Ultimately, the judge ruled that Dreier remain free on bail pending his sentencing hearing on July 13, 2009. Dreier had been initially released on bail on February 13, 2009. On February 5, 2009 U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan had written in a brief that a total of 10 conditions set for the release Marc Dreier \\"will be sufficient to reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court as required\\". He issued a formal bail order on February 9, 2009 that Dreier be freed on $10 million bond, under 24-hour house arrest with armed guards and electronic monitoring. Judge Rakoff noted prosecutors had demonstrated, for the limited purposes of bail, that Dreier \\"is not only a master of deceit and a doyen of dishonesty, but the kind of person who, under stress, may resort to desperate measures\\" and his motive to flee was \\"palpable\\". The bail package proposed by Dreier's lawyers \\"goes far to minimize this risk\\". The bond would be co-signed by his son and mother, holding them responsible if Dreier were to flee. He also ordered that all means of communication, other than a land-line telephone needed for electronic monitoring, be removed from Dreier's apartment and that no visitors would be allowed without approval from the government. In a letter to the magistrate judge opposing bail, assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan R. Streeter had said, Dreier is \\"exceptionally deceptive, brazen, creative and resourceful in achieving his criminal goals\\". On January 22, 2009, U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Eaton had modified his earlier ruling and set bond at $20 million, requiring Dreier to secure bail with $10 million in cash or property and include at least four co-signers, who would be required to pay the money if Dreier fled. Dreier also would have to submit to electronic monitoring and see a psychiatrist twice a week. He had asked to be freed on a $10 million bond and be subject to electronic monitoring. He said his mother and his 19-year-old son, Spencer, would co-sign the bond. Dreier was subsequently placed under house arrest and one of the court-appointed security guards monitoring him was a retired F.B.I. agent. Eaton told Shargel, \\"These are really extraordinary facts. His behavior was reckless, clever, improvising. Frankly, it suggests a mental disorder\\". =Kosta S. Kovachev= Kosta S. Kovachev was the son of two doctors who emigrated from Serbia in 1964 and set up practices in New York City. He was born in Belgrade, was educated at Columbia University and Harvard Business School, and joined Morgan Stanley in 1987. He left there after five years for a succession of smaller, obscure firms, then voluntarily gave up his broker's license in 2002. In 2006, he lost his broker's license from the National Association of Securities Dealers after being implicated in a $28 million Ponzi scheme. He refused to cooperate with investigators, and eventually paid more than $350,000 penalties and interest to settle the matter, while admitting no wrongdoing. Dreier was Kovachev's lawyer during that case. Kovachev had no real address (since the address on his driver's license was a defunct post office box in Florida) and no formal job. His cellphone bills went to the Harvard Club. Twice divorced, he had a grown son in the US Navy from his first marriage, and five other children from a second marriage. He had known Dreier for at least a decade by 2008. While not an employee of Dreier L.L.P., Kovachev had an electronic pass to the 499 Park Avenue office, including its computers and offices. On December 4, 2008, while Dreier was in a Canadian jail attempting to move cash out of the law firm's accounts, Kovachev appeared at the law firm to pick up three paintings. There were only two paintings, and Kovachev took them and left. On March 31, 2010, at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan, Kosta S. Kovachev, 58, was sentenced to 46 months in prison and a fine of $215,000 (the amount Dreier paid him for the impersonations). On November 2, 2009, he pleaded guilty to committing securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as a wire fraud charge, and admitted to impersonating an accountant for Solow Realty & Development at Dreier's request in a meeting with investors at their Manhattan offices; and then, impersonating Solow's then-Chief Executive, Steven Cherniak at Dreier's request in a separate phone call with investors. Kovachev was arrested in December of 2008. He was made to forfeit his services payment from Dreier for the caper: $215,000. Sentencing of upwards of five years was scheduled for March 5, 2010, along with more than $100 million in restitution. On April 22, 2009, Kovachev was arraigned on new charges: conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud, adding a forfeiture allegation seeking to obtain money placed by Kovachev in four different bank accounts. Kovachev waived indictment and entered a plea of not guilty. In April of 2010 Kovachev was sentenced to 3 years and 10 months in prison. Kovachev was paid $115,000 from the Dreier firm's operating account, and $100,000 from its attorney trust account. The Case Number, dated December 18, 2008 is: USA v. Kosta S. Kovachev, 08 MAG 2792. =Robert Miller= On November 9, 2009 Robert Miller, 52, of Englewood, New Jersey pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as securities fraud, at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis in Manhattan. He agreed to forfeit the compensation of $100,000 from Dreier in November 2008 for impersonating both a person at a Canadian pension plan, and, a few days later, a representative of an Icelandic hedge fund by telephone, to sell about $44.7 million in fictitious promissory notes. US District Judge Kimba Wood sentenced Miller to two years' probation. From 1983 to 1986, he was a staff attorney in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Enforcement Division, and from 1987 to 2008, he was an analyst and money manager. Between 1999 and 2008, he and Dreier managed an investment fund together. SEC civil charge On December 8, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dreier with fraud in connection with an elaborate scheme that raised at least $113 million from the sale of bogus promissory notes. The complaint charges that since at least October 2008, Dreier had been marketing illegitimate promissory notes, including bogus notes of a New York‚Äìbased real estate development company, to hedge funds, and other private investment funds. He had closed at least three sales, convincing purchasers that the notes were genuine. Dreier distributed fake financial statements and audit opinion letters of a reputable accounting firm and recruited assistance to represent legitimate companies involved in the transactions, including false e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. Dreier directed that two purchasers of the bogus notes wire payment to his law firm's escrow account. At least one purchaser discovered the fraud and received the return of its investment. There is an unaccounting of approximately $100 million in known proceeds from the sale of the bogus notes. Dreier had been offering fictitious promissory notes in the name of former client, Solow Realty, a New York real estate development company. Since at least October 2008, Dreier had approached at least three different investment funds with an offer to sell, at a deep discount, various short-term, unsecured promissory notes, ostensibly issued by Solow. Two of the investment funds agreed to purchase the notes (one fund purchased notes in two separate transactions) and forwarded the payments of approximately $113 million to an account in the name of \\"Dreier LLP Attorney Trust Account\\". A third fund was offered the notes, but declined to participate. All of the offers were accompanied by documents that Dreier subsequently admitted he knew were fabricated. Dreier offered the notes for sale even though he knew Solow had never issued them, had not authorized Dreier to market them, and knew nothing of their existence. Dreier had provided the hedge funds with fabricated documents including a \\"form\\" note and related agreements, \\"audited financial statements\\", and purported audit letters, which bore the forged signature of Solow's auditor, but which were printed on purported stationery of Solow's auditing firm. Dreier never told the representatives from the hedge funds that the entire marketing and sales plan was fictitious. On December 8, 2008, the SEC filed declarations from firm controller John Provenzano and Dreier lawyer Norman N. Kinel. Provenzano detailed how millions of dollars were missing from client accounts. He stated that he was aware since he took his position in August 2005 of the disbursement of between $30 million and $40 million in Dreier accounts to pay for works of art. Dreier LLP maintained eight escrow accounts where client funds were commingled and eight other accounts for individual clients. Kinel e-mailed Dreier on December 1 requesting disbursal of $38.5 million out of an escrow account on behalf of 360networks (USA) Inc., a client that had emerged from bankruptcy in 2002. Dreier had remained counsel for the official committee of unsecured creditors in connection with 360's Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Kinel asked for the money for distribution to unsecured creditors, but only $19 million remained in the accounts. Provenzano recounted that in phone conversations with other firm partners, Joel A. Chernov and Steven R. Gursky on December 3 and 4. Dreier said that, had he not been in custody, he would have been able to return to New York and sell some of his art so the money could be returned. On both days, Provenzano was asked by Dreier, who was incarcerated in Canada on a charge of impersonation, related to his dealings with the hedge funds, to transfer $8 million and then $10 million from the escrow accounts into Dreier's own accounts, but Provenzano refused. The case is SEC v. Dreier, 08-cv-10617 U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Assets The assets of Dreier LLP and its affiliates were frozen by court order. A Statement of Financial Affairs, filed on February 16, 2009, with the Southern District of New York U.S. Bankruptcy Court, disclosed that Dreier LLP had $59 million in assets and $42 million in liabilities, some $30 million of which is owed to creditors holding secured claims. In 2008, salaries for contract partners ranged as high as $1 million or more. Dreier, the firm's sole equity partner, received more than $6.5 million per year, and $375,000 was paid to his 19-year-old son, Spencer, over the course of two years. The figures were based upon an unaudited copy of the firm's books and records. A 10-page list of property filed with the Court some of which includes: 5 bank/investment accounts; Boats: \\"Seascape\\", 2005 Hessen Motor Yacht, 2008 Novorunia Equator Yacht Tender, Yamaha Waverunners (4); Cars: 2007 Aston Martin, DB9 Volante, 2006 BMW 650i convertible, 2000 Mercedes Benz S500 Sedan, 1997 Mercedes Benz SL500 Roadster; More than 100 works of Art: \\"Chair with Book on Red Carpet\\", David Hockney; \\"First Painting with Bottle\\", Roy Lichtenstein; \\"Blue Jackie\\", \\"White Jackie\\", \\"Jackie Profile Looking Down\\", Andy Warhol; \\"Portrait of a Girl\\", Pablo Picasso; \\"Grand Masque\\", Henri Matisse; \\"Big Thief\\", Tom Otterness, and a 2006 high-definition, Salma Hayek video by Soho photographer Robert Wilson; Real Estate: New York City condominium 151 E. 58th street; Hamptons homes: East Quogue (2), Sag Harbor; Anguilla, West Indies condominium (2). After his arrest, Dreier attempted to transfer the two properties in the Hamptons, worth a total of US$12.5 million, to his son, Spencer. Spencer asked the caretaker of the properties to file papers claiming that the father had signed over interest in the properties back in October, as a reward for agreeing to spend the summer with him. The caretaker declined to do so. =Chapter 11 bankruptcy= Mark Pomerantz of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was named court-appointed receiver for Dreier LLP. On December 16, 2008, Pomerantz filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on behalf of the firm, declaring that \\"no effective management\\" exists at the firm in the wake of Dreier's arrest. Dreier was the sole equity partner of the firm. The firm owed malpractice insurance carrier Chubb Group of Insurance Companies more than $213,000 in unpaid bills by December 31, 2008, otherwise the $10 million insurance policy would expire and leave Dreier's 240 or so lawyers without coverage. On March 26, 2009, Pomerantz disclosed he had recovered more than $100 million in assets, including $39 million in art; an $18 million, yacht; homes in Manhattan; three properties in the Hamptons; parcels in Anguilla owned by Dreier or his family members; and five cars. The yacht, Seascape, liquidation price reduced from $13.5 million to $12.5 million, was bought through the sale of fake notes. Dreier held stock certificates in an office safe, and stakes in a company called People Capital, as well as a startup bio- diesel firm in Argentina. He also controlled an investment vehicle called Armada Partners. However, \\"large amounts\\" were not collectible. Pomerantz's firm will be billing $1.4 million for its services. On March 26, 2009, an auction held at the law office sold most of the firm's furnishings and accoutrements at rock bottom prices, with the exception for Dreier's furniture and paintings. On June 17, 2009, his two neighboring oceanfront homes in Southampton/East Quogue, New York were scheduled to be auctioned for possibly up to $12.5 million. On July 21, 2009, his 34th floor, four-bedroom, five- bathroom Manhattan apartment, with massive outdoor terrace, was sold at auction for $8.2 million, about $2 million less than the $10.43 million he paid in 2007. =Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy= Sheila Gowan, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of the law firm, filed a Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy petition for Dreier on January 26, 2009. Wachovia Bank National Association and the bankruptcy estate of 360networks Inc also joined Gowan in the involuntary petition as creditors. The three said they were owed about $88.5 million. Fortress Investment Group LLC, a private-equity and hedge-fund manager, lost $125.7 million buying phony promissory notes supposedly issued by Solow Realty & Development Co.. Elliott Management Corp., a hedge-fund firm, lost $101.1 million. Eton Park Capital Management LP lost $84.4 million; Perella Weinberg Partners, $46 million; Concordia Advisors LLC, $22.3 million; Novator, $20 million; and Meyer Ventures LLC, $13.4 million. Dreier owed more than $40-million to various creditors, including many of the firm's own lawyers. Chapter 7 Trustee Salvatore LaMonica, who was in charge of Dreier's bankruptcy case in the personal liquidation proceeding initiated by several creditors, went to bankruptcy court, seeking permission to hire an auctioneer to sell off Dreier's three properties: The Upper East Side apartment, and the two neighboring properties in the Hamptons. Unraveled, which includes interviews with Dreier and his son while Dreier awaited sentencing, was shown in the UK on BBC 4 on September 5, 2012 under the title \\"The $750 Million Thief\\", as a 1-hour 20 minute documentary in BBC-TV's series \\"Storyville\\".

He was born in Essendon, Victoria, the grandson of William Dowsley, a farmer from St Arnaud, Victoria, and Emily Dowsley n√©e Donnelly. Harcourt Dowsley's parents were Allan Harcourt Dowsley and Kathleen Olive Dowsley n√©e Gaetz. A brother, William Allan Dowsley, predeceased him in March 2014. Dowsley made his first- class debut in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937/38 when he opened the batting and made scores of 46 and 72 not out. Tasmania would be Dowsley's opponent in all of his five first-class matches, the first three coming before his VFL stint and the other two after. An Old Melburnian, Dowsley played his football as a full-forward and kicked four goals on debut in the 1941 VFL season, against St Kilda at Junction Oval. He kept his spot in the side for the next couple of games, kicking a further three goals, before joining the RAAF with whom he would serve in the World War II Pacific campaign. When Dowsley returned from war he turned his attention to cricket and in 1946 played two first-class matches to finish his career with 336 runs at 56.00, including three half centuries. He also took two wickets at 37.00 with his right-arm fast-medium bowling. He died in October 2014, aged 95.
