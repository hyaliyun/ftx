It is a part of the Spiš- Gemer Karst, which in turn is a part of the Slovak Ore Mountains, a major subdivision of the Western Carpathians. It is located between the towns of Spišská Nová Ves in the north and Dobšiná in the south. It is particularly known for its gorges and waterfalls. It is very popular with hikers as it has a number of unusual routes through gorges and waterfalls. There are numerous sections where fixed ladders are used to climb. The area is protected by Slovak Paradise National Park (Národný park Slovenský raj). Characteristics Slovak Paradise is a plain with high plateaus (800–1000 m AMSL). The highest mountain is Ondrejisko at 1,270 m. The area is mainly built of karst limestone (Geravy, Glac, Pelc and Skala plains) and dolomite (Tri kopce). The karst plateaus show phenomena such as sinkholes and limestone pavements (lapies). The climate is moderately cold. Typical features are canyons, gorges, and ravines (Sokol, Suchá Belá, Piecky and Kyseľ), which form picturesque rocky scenes with waterfalls, and which were created mainly by the Hnilec and Hornád rivers and their tributaries. Eighty percent of the area is covered with spruce forests combined with yew trees. There are more than 200 caves and underground abysses. Among the caves, Dobšiná Ice Cave and Medvedia jaskyňa (Bear Cave) are the best known ones. There were many settlements of woodcutters, colliers and smelters in Slovak Paradise once, which were turned into tourist centers; for example, Dobšinská Maša, Dedinky, Mlynky, and Stratená. Fauna Notable and rare animals include the brown bear (Ursus arctos), golden eagle, common kestrel and the black stork. Quite common are red deer and wild boars, wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and the otter (Lutra lutra). Flora The area is covered with Norway spruce (Picea abies), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), fir, larch, and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Important endemic plants in the area are the Carpathian harebell (Campanula carpatica), Pulsatilla slavica, Hesperis silvestris, Liguria sibirica, and Saxifraga paniculate. Other plants found in this area are the mountain tassel flower (Soldanella montana), martagon lily (Lilium martagon), and variegated monk's hood (Aconitum variegatum).

Eye- gouging is prohibited in modern sports. It is a serious offence in rugby football codes where it occurs rarely. It is prohibited in combat sports, but some self-defense systems teach it. Training in eye-gouging can involve extensive grappling training to establish control, the eye-gouging itself being practiced with the opponent wearing eye protection such as swimming goggles.

The Mizorans practice eugenics; all of them are blonde \\"Aryans,\\" who disdain people of darker skin. (In modern terms their society is deliberately racist. That term is perhaps applicable to the book as well.) In its ancient history, the land was ruled by a military general elected president (a version of Ulysses Grant). When the general ran for a third term (as Grant was urged to do in 1880), the society of Mizora descended into chaos. Eventually a new all-female social order arose in Mizora. The last men were \\"eliminated\\" -- though it is not clear whether they were overtly killed or left to die out. It is said that men are more forgotten than hated. The novel also refers to political repression in contemporary Russia, and the suppression of the Polish revolt of 1863. The first-person narrator, Vera Zarovitch, is a young political fugitive who has fallen foul of the Czarist regime and been sentenced to exile in Siberia. She escapes northward into the Arctic, where her kayak is swept over a vast waterfall to Mizora. She spends fifteen years there, learning the ways of the culture; at the end of that time she longs to return to her husband and child, and teach her own society what she has learned. Although Vera ultimately manages to return to her own society, her husband and son are dead, and a Mizoran friend also dies. Vera is left only with the hope that future generations will be better off, \\"through the promises of universal education and the deeply questionable practice of eugenics\\". As a utopian novel, the book devotes some time to the futuristic technology such as \\"videophones.\\" The Mizorans can make rain by discharging electricity into the air. Though Mizora has no domestic animals, its women eat chemically-prepared artificial meat -- an innovation that is only under development in the early twenty-first century. Lane plays with the customs and conventions of her own society, as utopian writers normally do. In Mizora, a narrow waist is considered a \\"disgusting deformity\\" -- reversing the preference of Lane's own time for tightly-corseted women. Lane's book anticipates some of the features of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's famous Herland by three decades. It was closely followed by other feminist utopian works, Mrs. George Corbett's New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future (1889), and Unveiling a Parallel (1893) by collaborators Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant. Simultaneously, some male utopian writers published works that involve feminist issues and questions of gender roles; Charles Bellamy's An Experiment in Marriage (1889) and Linn Boyd Porter's Speaking of Ellen (1890) are examples. Mizora also belongs to the curious class of hollow Earth literature.Peter Fitting, Subterranean Worlds: A Critical Anthology, Middletown, CT, Wesleyan University Press, 2004; p. 157. The second edition of Mizora appeared in 1975, and it was re-released in 1999 by the University of Nebraska Press. Little is known of the author; Mrs. Lane did not want her husband to find out she was writing about the world being better off without men.

Such systems are therefore also known as infinite-dimensional systems. Typical examples are systems described by partial differential equations or by delay differential equations.  Linear time-invariant distributed parameter systems  = Abstract evolution equations =  Discrete-time  With U, X and Y Hilbert spaces and A, ∈ L(X), B, ∈ L(U, X), C, ∈ L(X, Y) and D, ∈ L(U, Y) the following difference equations determine a discrete-time linear time- invariant system: :x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k), :y(k)=Cx(k)+Du(k), with x, (the state) a sequence with values in X, u, (the input or control) a sequence with values in U and y, (the output) a sequence with values in Y.  Continuous- time  The continuous-time case is similar to the discrete-time case but now one considers differential equations instead of difference equations: :dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t), , :y(t)=Cx(t)+Du(t), . An added complication now however is that to include interesting physical examples such as partial differential equations and delay differential equations into this abstract framework, one is forced to consider unbounded operators. Usually A is assumed to generate a strongly continuous semigroup on the state space X. Assuming B, C and D to be bounded operators then already allows for the inclusion of many interesting physical examples,Curtain and Zwart but the inclusion of many other interesting physical examples forces unboundedness of B and C as well. = Example: a partial differential equation = The partial differential equation with t>0 and xiin[0,1] given by :frac{partial}{partial t}w(t,xi)=-frac{partial}{partialxi}w(t,xi)+u(t), :w(0,xi)=w_0(xi), :w(t,0)=0, :y(t)=int_0^1 w(t,xi),dxi, fits into the abstract evolution equation framework described above as follows. The input space U and the output space Y are both chosen to be the set of complex numbers. The state space X is chosen to be L2(0, 1). The operator A is defined as :Ax=-x',~~~D(A)=left{xin X: xtext{ absolutely continuous }, x'in L^2(0,1)text{ and }x(0)=0right}. It can be shownCurtain and Zwart Example 2.2.4 that A generates a strongly continuous semigroup on X. The bounded operators B, C and D are defined as :Bu=u,~~~Cx=int_0^1 x(xi),dxi,~~~D=0. = Example: a delay differential equation = The delay differential equation :dot{w}(t)=w(t)+w(t-tau)+u(t), :y(t)=w(t), fits into the abstract evolution equation framework described above as follows. The input space U and the output space Y are both chosen to be the set of complex numbers. The state space X is chosen to be the product of the complex numbers with L2(−τ, 0). The operator A is defined as :Abegin{pmatrix}rfend{pmatrix}=begin{pmatrix}r+f(-tau)f'end{pmatrix},~~~D(A)=left{begin{pmatrix}rfend{pmatrix}in X: ftext{ absolutely continuous }, f'in L^2([-tau,0])text{ and }r=f(0)right}. It can be shownCurtain and Zwart Theorem 2.4.6 that A generates a strongly continuous semigroup on X. The bounded operators B, C and D are defined as :Bu=begin{pmatrix}u0end{pmatrix},~~~Cbegin{pmatrix}rfend{pmatrix}=r,~~~D=0. = Transfer functions = As in the finite-dimensional case the transfer function is defined through the Laplace transform (continuous-time) or Z-transform (discrete-time). Whereas in the finite-dimensional case the transfer function is a proper rational function, the infinite-dimensionality of the state space leads to irrational functions (which are however still holomorphic).  Discrete-time  In discrete-time the transfer function is given in terms of the state space parameters by D+sum_{k=0}^infty CA^kBz^k and it is holomorphic in a disc centered at the origin.This is the mathematical convention, engineers seem to prefer transfer functions to be holomorphic at infinity; this is achieved by replacing z by 1/z In case 1/z belongs to the resolvent set of A (which is the case on a possibly smaller disc centered at the origin) the transfer function equals D+Cz(I-zA)^{-1}B. An interesting fact is that any function that is holomorphic in zero is the transfer function of some discrete-time system.  Continuous-time  If A generates a strongly continuous semigroup and B, C and D are bounded operators, thenCurtain and Zwart Lemma 4.3.6 the transfer function is given in terms of the state space parameters by D+C(sI-A)^{-1}B for s with real part larger than the exponential growth bound of the semigroup generated by A. In more general situations this formula as it stands may not even make sense, but an appropriate generalization of this formula still holds.Staffans Theorem 4.6.7 To obtain an easy expression for the transfer function it is often better to take the Laplace transform in the given differential equation than to use the state space formulas as illustrated below on the examples given above.  Transfer function for the partial differential equation example  Setting the initial condition w_0 equal to zero and denoting Laplace transforms with respect to t by capital letters we obtain from the partial differential equation given above :sW(s,xi)=-frac{d}{dxi}W(s,xi)+U(s), :W(s,0)=0, :Y(s)=int_0^1 W(s,xi),dxi. This is an inhomogeneous linear differential equation with xi as the variable, s as a parameter and initial condition zero. The solution is W(s,xi)=U(s)(1-e^{-sxi})/s. Substituting this in the equation for Y and integrating gives Y(s)=U(s)(e^{-s}+s-1)/s^2 so that the transfer function is (e^{-s}+s-1)/s^2.  Transfer function for the delay differential equation example  Proceeding similarly as for the partial differential equation example, the transfer function for the delay equation example isCurtain and Zwart Example 4.3.13 1/(s-1-e^{-s}). = Controllability = In the infinite-dimensional case there are several non- equivalent definitions of controllability which for the finite-dimensional case collapse to the one usual notion of controllability. The three most important controllability concepts are: *Exact controllability, *Approximate controllability, *Null controllability.  Controllability in discrete-time  An important role is played by the maps Phi_n which map the set of all U valued sequences into X and are given by Phi_n u=sum_{k=0}^n A^kBu_k. The interpretation is that Phi_nu is the state that is reached by applying the input sequence u when the initial condition is zero. The system is called *exactly controllable in time n if the range of Phi_n equals X, *approximately controllable in time n if the range of Phi_n is dense in X, *null controllable in time n if the range of Phi_n includes the range of An.  Controllability in continuous-time  In controllability of continuous- time systems the map Phi_t given by int_0^t {rm e}^{As}Bu(s),ds plays the role that Phi_n plays in discrete-time. However, the space of control functions on which this operator acts now influences the definition. The usual choice is L2(0, ∞;U), the space of (equivalence classes of) U-valued square integrable functions on the interval (0, ∞), but other choices such as L1(0, ∞;U) are possible. The different controllability notions can be defined once the domain of Phi_t is chosen. The system is calledTucsnak Definition 11.1.1 *exactly controllable in time t if the range of Phi_t equals X, *approximately controllable in time t if the range of Phi_t is dense in X, *null controllable in time t if the range of Phi_t includes the range of {rm e}^{At}. = Observability = As in the finite-dimensional case, observability is the dual notion of controllability. In the infinite- dimensional case there are several different notions of observability which in the finite-dimensional case coincide. The three most important ones are: *Exact observability (also known as continuous observability), *Approximate observability, *Final state observability.  Observability in discrete-time  An important role is played by the maps Psi_n which map X into the space of all Y valued sequences and are given by (Psi_nx)_k=CA^kx if k ≤ n and zero if k > n. The interpretation is that Psi_nx is the truncated output with initial condition x and control zero. The system is called *exactly observable in time n if there exists a kn > 0 such that Psi_nxgeq k_nx for all x ∈ X, *approximately observable in time n if Psi_n is injective, *final state observable in time n if there exists a kn > 0 such that Psi_nxgeq k_nA^nx for all x ∈ X.  Observability in continuous-time  In observability of continuous-time systems the map Psi_t given by (Psi_t)(s)=C{rm e}^{As}x for s∈[0,t] and zero for s>t plays the role that Psi_n plays in discrete-time. However, the space of functions to which this operator maps now influences the definition. The usual choice is L2(0, ∞, Y), the space of (equivalence classes of) Y-valued square integrable functions on the interval (0,∞), but other choices such as L1(0, ∞, Y) are possible. The different observability notions can be defined once the co-domain of Psi_t is chosen. The system is calledTucsnak Definition 6.1.1 *exactly observable in time t if there exists a kt > 0 such that Psi_txgeq k_tx for all x ∈ X, *approximately observable in time t if Psi_t is injective, *final state observable in time t if there exists a kt > 0 such that Psi_txgeq k_t{rm e}^{At}x for all x ∈ X. = Duality between controllability and observability = As in the finite-dimensional case, controllability and observability are dual concepts (at least when for the domain of Phi and the co-domain of Psi the usual L2 choice is made). The correspondence under duality of the different concepts is:Tucsnak Theorem 11.2.1 *Exact controllability ↔ Exact observability, *Approximate controllability ↔ Approximate observability, *Null controllability ↔ Final state observability.

It is commonly used as a fuel within the steel works, but it can be used in boilers and power plants equipped to burn it. It may be combined with natural gas or coke oven gas before combustion or a flame support with richer gas or oil is provided to sustain combustion. Particulate matter is removed so that it can be burned more cleanly. Blast furnace gas is sometimes flared without generating heat or electricity. Blast furnace gas is generated at higher pressure and at about in a modern blast furnace. This pressure is utilized to operate a generator (Top- gas-pressure Recovery Turbine - i.e. TRT in short), which can generate electrical energy up to 35 kWh/t of pig iron without burning any fuel. Dry type TRTs can generate more power than wet type TRT. Auto ignition point of blast furnace gas is approximate and it has LEL (Lower Explosive Limit) of 27% & UEL (Upper Explosive Limit) of 75% in an air-gas mixture at normal temperature and pressure.

Mankiewicz. It stars Rex Harrison, Susan Hayward, Cliff Robertson, Capucine, Edie Adams, and Maggie Smith. The film was based on the play Mr. Fox of Venice by Frederick Knott, the novel The Evil of the Day by Thomas Sterling, and loosely on the 1606 play Volpone by Ben Jonson. Plot Susan Hayward as Mrs. Sheridan Struggling actor William McFly (Cliff Robertson) is hired by wealthy Cecil Fox (Rex Harrison) to play his personal secretary for a practical joke. Pretending to be on his deathbed, Fox invites three former lovers to his Venetian palazzo for a final visit: penniless Princess Dominique (Capucine), fading movie star Merle McGill (Edie Adams), and Texas millionairess Mrs. Lone Star Crockett Sheridan (Susan Hayward). Accompanying Mrs. Sheridan is her nurse, Sarah Watkins (Maggie Smith). By chance, each of the women brings Fox a timepiece as a present. The three women warily size each other up. Mrs. Sheridan boldly announces that the others might as well go home, as she is Fox's common-law wife, and they can expect to inherit nothing. However, when Sarah returns from a late-night date with McFly, she finds her employer dead of an overdose of sleeping pills, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Rizzi (Adolfo Celi) investigates. Sarah knows that the pills Mrs. Sheridan had been taking are harmless fakes. McFly has already revealed to Sarah that Fox is perpetrating a charade, and that the final joke is to be the reading of the will, empowering McFly to choose the heir. She therefore suspects him not only of being the murderer, but also plotting to kill Fox. When she confronts McFly, he locks her in her room, telling her it is for her own safety. She manages to escape via a dumbwaiter and warns Fox. However, his displeased reaction puzzles her. He sends her back to her room. The next morning, Fox is found dead. McFly reveals that Fox was the killer of Sarah's employer. He was broke and wanted Mrs. Sheridan's fortune. Once McFly had figured it out (and more importantly, told Sarah), Fox realized it was all up and committed suicide. Sarah asks McFly to write her name down in the will as the heir of Fox's worthless estate as a souvenir, with Rizzi signing as a witness. After McFly complies, an amused Rizzi compliments him on his \\"generosity\\"—while Fox may have been deeply in debt, Mrs. Sheridan's estate is so vast, Sarah will still emerge an extremely wealthy woman. She informs McFly that she will marry him and hand over the money once he resumes his law studies and becomes a lawyer.

(, also spelt U Gaung; 3 February 1822 – 30 June 1908) was a chief minister during the reigns of King Mindon and Thibaw, as well as a colonial civil servant. He attempted to westernise the Burmese kingdom's existing bureaucracy into a more democratic system. Because of such attempts to do so, he was accused by many to have allowed Britain to win the Third Anglo-Burmese War.

As was customary tradition, he was destined to follow the footsteps of his father. However, he escaped conscription by ordaining as a Buddhist monk and was given the Dharma name Āloka (). He moved to Amarapura and lived at Bagaya Monastery, the monastery of the Bagaya Sayadaw, then the Supreme Patriarch of the Konbaung dynasty. He was also schooled at a college led by U Yanwe, who eventually became the chief minister of King Mindon with the title Pakan Mingyi. He disrobed and returned to the laity at the age of 25. U Kaung's residence at Fort Dufferin (former Mandalay Palace) in 1903. Joining service After the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1853, he joined the court service of King Mindon (who had deposed his half brother, King Pagan), who renamed him U Kaung (, lit. \\"good\\", considered more favorable than his birth name Chin) and appointed him the Clerk of the Royal Treasury (). In 1871, he was appointed minister of third rank () at the Hluttaw, the national governing body and was responsible for the country's police and customs stations, where he earned his moniker Kinwun (lit. 'minister of the patrol stations'). In 1871, he led the first Burmese diplomatic group to Europe and successfully asserted Burmese sovereignty. In preparation for the trip, he rose to the rank of Wungyi, the chief minister. There, he was received by Queen Victoria and invested Prince of Wales (later to be King Edward VII) and William Ewart Gladstone gold salwe of 21 and 18 strings respectively. he and his embassy, consisting of Shwe O (later the Kyaukmyaung Atwinwun) and Shwe Bin and Maung Mye (later the Debayin Wundauk). By 1872, he had risen to the rank of regional governor of Minhla District. Burmese Embassy to France 1873 or 1874 Before King Mindon's death in 1878, U Kaung was made Commander-in-Chief. After King Mindon's death, Kinwun Mingyi lost much of his influence. He ordered the Burmese troops during the Third Anglo-Burmese War to not attack invading British. U Kaung's role in the initial collapse of Burmese resistance later gave rise to the popular mnemonic U Kaung lein htouk, minzet pyouk (\\"U Kaung's treachery, end of dynasty\\", ), corresponding to Burmese Era 1247 or 1885 AD in Burmese numerology.Correspondences: U=1, Ka=2, La=4, Hta=7 British rule Under British colonial rule, Kinwon Mingyi served as a civil servant in the British administration. In 1888, he was awarded the Companions of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) and in 1897, he became one of the first two indigenous Burmese to be appointed to the Legislative Council of Burma. During his civil service, he penned many famous books and poems in Burmese literature. Among them were the Attathamkhepa Wunnana Dhammathat () and the Digest of Buddhist Law. His personal library was acquired by the Bernard Free Library in Rangoon. U Kaung was twice married. His first marriage was to the Princess of Singyan, one of the lesser queens of Pagan Min. His second was to Shwe May, the daughter of the myothugyi (hereditary chief) of Ahlone, a town in Monywa Township. He did not have any biological children, but he adopted two sons of his brother-in-law (of his second wife). He died of paralysis at his residence in Fort Dufferin in Mandalay on 30 June 1908.

Wright also played many first-class cricket games for the Marylebone Cricket Club. His Test match career was limited to three appearances for England against South Africa in 1895-96. Wright was an opening batsman and wicket-keeper. Wright was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge. In total Wright went on four overseas tours, all of which were captained by Lord Hawke. These were to the United States and Canada in 1891 and 1894, to India in 1892-93, and then on the South African tour in which Wright played his Tests. He is also notable for two other occurrences: *In 1890 he was the first captain to declare an innings closed. In a game against Kent at the Bat and Ball Ground in Gravesend, Wright declared Nottinghamshire's second innings closed on 157 for 5 to set Kent a target of 231 to win. However, the tactic did not come off as the game was drawn with Kent on 98 for 9 and Nottinghamshire requiring one more wicket to win. *In 1893 Wright became the fourth batsman to be given out handled the ball after he picked up a ball that had become lodged in his pads and returned it to a fielder. Wright retired from the game after losing his eye in a shooting accident and later became a long-standing member of the Nottinghamshire Cricket Club's committee. See also *Declaration and forfeiture *Handled the ball Note *1 Cricinfo's page on Wright erroneously states that he was the second batsman to be given out handled the ball rather than the fourth. The first three cases were: J Grundy for the MCC against Kent in 1857, George \\"Farmer\\" Bennett for Kent against Sussex in 1872 and William Scotton for Smokers against Non smokers in 1886-7.

Cary was born in Hammersmith, London, to Lucius Cary, 15th Viscount of Falkland, and Caroline Butler. His father is an elected hereditary peer, and Cary is next in line to be Viscount of Falkland, the senior viscountcy of Scotland (created in 1620 by Scottish King James VI). Cary grew up in Chelsea, London, where his neighbours were actors André Morell and Joan Greenwood. He knew from the age of twelve that he wanted to work in the film industry. He was initially educated at Westminster School, but was expelled before his A-levels, and sent instead to Loretto in Scotland. He left with unremarkable grades and, after a brief stint as a runner in a New York theatre, joined the army on a whim: \\"I had a bet with a friend who didn't think I could do it, but I loved it. Having been a total pain in the neck about authority at school, I took a perverse enjoyment in being given instructions and carrying them out.\\" He graduated from Sandhurst Military Academy in 1985 and was commissioned as an officer into the Scots Guards. He was posted to Northern Ireland during the height of the Troubles. He saw active service during the Gulf War, in which he was attached to a company of United States Marines. He left the military shortly after the war, and went to Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter. After a decade of little success, he achieved a spot in the writers' room for the first series of Lie to Me in 2009. He later became a writer and producer for Homeland, and has also worked on The Riches and In Plain Sight. In 2013, he became engaged to American actress Jennifer Marsala, a cast member in Homeland. The marriage took place in Somerset on 31 December 2013. He has a son, Lucius (born in Los Angeles on 6 February 1995), from his first marriage to Linda Purl, as well as a son, Sebastien (born 2004), from a short-lived relationship. He appeared in the BBC program The Gift on 10 February 2015, in which he met a fellow ex-soldier who wished to thank him for saving his life.

The book tells the story of Ahmet Celal, a retired Turkish officer and an intellectual, who leaves Istanbul after its occupation by the British army in 1918 and heads for the rustic village of one of his soldiers in central Anatolia. In this anti-pastoralist account, he finds that he is not welcomed by the peasants, although he once idealised them. Instead, he is sharply critical of the villagers' religious fundamentalism and their lack of patriotism toward the nationalist cause, even as the Turkish Army under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is getting closer to realising its goal of achieving total independence. As he spends time in the village, he becomes more and more isolated by the local inhabitants and loses his personal war. The novel expresses a commonly ignored side to the National Movement of those days, opposing the general air of optimism which is said to have been dominant in the struggle for independence and shows the instability of Turkish unity in 1918. 1932 novels Turkish novels Novels set in Turkey Fiction set in 1918 ","title":"Yaban"},{"id":"3523446","text":"Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, Wales.

It is based on the novel The Season Ticket by Jonathan Tulloch. Other actors in the film include Roy Hudd, Charlie Hardwick, Tim Healy, Kerry Ann Christiansen and Kevin Whately. There is also a cameo appearance by footballer Alan Shearer, whose car the boys steal. Title The title is a Geordie dialect expression. \\"Pure\\" simply means very, and \\"Belter\\" or \\"Belta\\" means great or good. Despite it being based in Newcastle Upon-Tyne and following Newcastle United F.C, the actual dialect phrase \\"Pure Belter\\" has been altered to \\"Purely Belter\\" to make it grammatically more conventional for a mainstream audience. The phrase is spoken several times in the film, first by Sewell when he and Gerry go skinny dipping after stealing Shearer's car and later when they dream of the freedom they will have when they get money. There is an ironic tinge to the film; despite it being all about Newcastle United, the two actors playing Gerry and Sewell are actually from Sunderland and are massive Sunderland A.F.C fans. Plot The events take place over a year, the film being divided into four sections named after the four seasons. Sewell and Gerry, football-mad teenagers from broken families in Gateshead, break into Newcastle United's St James' Park stadium and steal the \\"sacred\\" turf from the penalty spot. After this success, they dream of earning money to get season tickets, with aid from their guardian angel, the Angel of the North. For the two tickets they plan to buy, they will need nearly a thousand pounds. After attempts to make money from collecting scrap and baby sitting, they eventually graduate to more criminal activities, including shoplifting and housebreaking. Gerry keeps the money they accumulate in a tin box at home. Sewell, who lives with his permanently befuddled grandfather (Roy Hudd), adopts a dog who follows him after wandering away from his owner, a local thug. He also dreams of Gemma, a girl who is engaged to Zak, a muscular ice-hockey player for the \\"Whitley Bay Warriors\\". At home, Gerry lives with his sickly mother (Charlie Hardwick) and his sister Clare (Tracy Whitwell) who has a baby called \\"Sheara\\". They are separated from their violent father Billy (Tim Healy) who has been sexually abusing Gerry's other sister Bridget, who has run away from home. When Billy finds where they live and badly beats Gerry's mother, the family have to move to a secret location. Gerry is bribed by a social worker to attend school for two weeks after which he will get two free football tickets. At the school he is bullied by his teacher (Kevin Whately). Gerry and Sewell attempt to rob his house in revenge, but are nearly caught. When Gerry gets the tickets he is horrified to discover that they are for a Sunderland match. After failing to sell them, the two friends watch the match at the Stadium of Light. Billy finds the family's new flat and steals all the money Gerry has accumulated. At an empty fairground, Gerry spots his sister Bridget (Kerry Ann Christiansen), who is now a drug addict sleeping rough, but she disappears when he leaves to get some food. After Gemma breaks up with Zak the ice-hockey player, she becomes Sewell's girlfriend. The lads' shoplifting is shown on the TV show Crimestoppers. The thug who originally owned the dog sees the show and spots the animal with Sewell. He finds and attacks him. The seemingly weak and mild- mannered Sewell floors him with a single blow on the neck. At the Newcastle United Training ground at the Riverside pavilion (Chester-le-street), they briefly meet Alan Shearer and ask him to give them season tickets, but he just laughs. They steal a sports car, which turns out to be Shearer's. Looking at his CDs, Sewell is appalled by his musical tastes - (Gabrielle and Celine Dion). Eventually they leave the car and go skinny dipping. Sewell is delighted when Gemma reveals she is pregnant, but horrified when she goes back to her former fiancé. Sewell attacks him during an ice-hockey match and knocks him out, but is beaten up by his team mates. Gerry's mother becomes ill and is hospitalised. Gerry finds Billy, who ignores his pleas for support. Having lost all their earnings, Sewell and Gerry decide on one last major crime - a bank robbery. The crime goes disastrously wrong and the lads end up under arrest. However, Gerry learns that Billy has been killed in a road accident. The friends are sentenced to 200 hours of community service. One old lady they work for allows them to watch Newcastle play from the balcony of her towerblock, which overlooks the stadium.

The Samma dynasty has left its mark in Sindh with noted structures including the necropolis of and royalties in Thatta.Population Census of Pakistan, 1972: Jacobabad Background Uch Sharif The Sindh is a fertile valley with a sub-tropical climate watered by the Indus river, the location of some of the oldest civilizations in the world, with settlements dating back to 7000 BCE. Always a prize possession, it has been controlled by many different empires, alternating with periods of independence. Before the Samma dynasty took control, the Sindh was ruled by the Soomra, first as nominal vassals of the Fatimid Caliphate of Cairo, later as vassals of the Turkic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, which reached its greatest extent under Muhammad bin Tughluq ( 1300–1351). The Sammahs, gained control of Thatta in the southern Sindh from the Sumras around 1335, and expanded their territory northward to Bhakkar and beyond. In 1361-62, Firuz Shah Tughlaq of Delhi Sultanate, invaded Sindh and again brought Sammas under his suzerainty. Throughout the period of the Samma dynasty, Turkic groups were pushing down from the northwest, including those led by Timur (Tamerlane) who sacked Delhi in 1398. Sindh remained under control of Khizr Khan, founder of Sayyid dynasty, who was an who was an appointed governor of Sindh and Multan provinces by Timur on his behalf. Sammas remained under Sayyid dynasty till 1451. Later Sammas were finally defeated by the Arghun dynasty, who had been displaced from Kandahar in Afghanistan by Babur, in 1519–1520. Beginnings Information about the early years of the Samma dynasty is very sketchy. We know from Ibn Battuta that in 1333 the Sammas were in rebellion, led by the Sammah chief founder of the dynasty, Jam feruzuddin Unar. The Sammas overthrew the Soomras soon after 1335 and the last Soomra ruler took shelter with the governor of Gujarat, under the protection of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the sultan of Delhi. Mohammad bin Tughlaq made an expedition against Sindh in 1351 and died at Sondha, possibly in an attempt to restore the Soomras. With this, the Sammas became independent. The next sultan, Firuz Shah Tughlaq attacked Sindh in 1365 and 1367, unsuccessfully, but with reinforcements from Delhi he later obtained Banbhiniyo's surrender. The Samma dynasty overtook the Sumra dynasty and ruled Sindh during 1365–1521. Around that time, the Sindhi Swarankar community returned from Kutch to their home towns in Sindh, and some settled empty land on the banks of Sindhu River near Dadu, Sindh. By the end of year 1500, nearly the entire Sindhi Swarankar community had returned to Sindh. This period marks the beginning of Sufistic thought and teachings in Sindh. For a period the Sammas were therefore subject to Delhi again. Later, as the Sultanate of Delhi collapsed they became fully independent.Directions in the History and Archaeology of Sindh by M. H. Panhwar During most of period of Samma rule, the Sindh was politically and economically tied to the Gujarat Sultanate, with occasional periods of friction. Coins struck by the Samma dynasty show the titles \\"Sultan\\" and \\"Shah\\" as well as \\"Jam\\", the Jadeja rulers of western Gujarat also part of Samma tribe and directly descended from Jam Ferouzuddin unar, the first Samma sultan of Sindh. Sandhai Muslims are Samma of Sindh,Even the Chudasama Rajputs of Gujarat are also part of Samma tribe, who are still Hindu, and distributed in Junagadh District and Bhal Region of Gujarat.People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham & A Mohideen page 1174-75 Popular Prakashan History The Samma dynasty took the title \\"Jam\\", the equivalent of \\"King\\" or \\"Sultan\\", because they claimed to be descended from Jamshid.[History of Delhi Sultanate by M.H. Syed (p240), 2005 ] The main sources of information on the Samma dynasty are Nizammud-din, Abu-'l-Fazl, Firishta and Mir Ma'sum, all lacking in detail, and with conflicting information. A plausible reconstruction of the chronology is given in the History of Delhi Sultanate by M. H. Syed, at right. =Jam Unar= Jam Feruzuddin Unar was the founder of Samma dynasty mentioned by Ibn Battuta, the famous traveller from North Africa (Ibn Battuta visited Sindh in 1333, and saw Samma's rebellion against Delhi government). Jam Feruz Unar, the Samma chief, taking advantage of the strained relation between the Soomra and the Sultanate of Delhi, defeated the last Soomra ruler, son of Dodo, and established Samma rule. =Jam Salahuddin= Jám Saláhuddìn bin Jám Tamáchí was the successor of his father Jám Tamáchí. He put down revolts in some parts of the country, by sending forces in those directions and punished the ringleaders. Some of these unruly bands fled to Kachh, to which place Jám Saláhuddín pursued them, and in every engagement that took place he defeated them and ultimately subjugated them. He died after a reign of 11 years. =Jam Ali Sher= Jám Alí Sher bin Jám Tamáchí ruled the country very discreetly. Tamáchí's other sons Sikandar and Karn, and Fateh Khán son of Sikandar, who had brought ruin on the last Jám, were now conspiring against Jám Alísher. They were therefore looking for an opportunity to fall upon him while he was out enjoying the moonlight as usual. They spent their time in the forests in the vicinity of the town. One Friday night, on the 13th of the lunar month, they took a band of cut-throats with them, and with naked swords attacked Jám Alísher who had come out in a boat to enjoy the moonlight on the quiet surface of the river and was returning home. They killed him, and red-handed they ran to the city, where the people had no help for it but to place one of them, Karan, on the vacant throne. The reign of Jám Alí Sher lasted for seven years. =Jam Fateh Khan bin Jam Sikandar= Jám Karan was succeeded by his nephew Jám Fateh Khán bin Sikandar. He ruled quietly for some time and gave satisfaction to the people in general. About this time, Mirza Pir Muhammad one of Amir Timur’s grandsons came to Multan and conquered that town and Uch. As he made a long stay there, most of the horses with him died of a disease and his horsemen were obliged to move about as foot-soldiers. When Amir Timur heard of this, he sent 30,000 horses from his own stables to his grandson to enable him to extend his conquests. Pir Muhammad, being thus equipped, attacked those of the zamindars who had threatened to do him harm and destroyed their household property. He then sent a messenger to Bakhar calling the chief men of the place to come and pay respects to him. But these men fearing his vengeance left the place in a body and went to Jesalmer. Only one solitary person, Sayyed Abulghais, one of the pious Sayyeds of the place, went to visit the Mirzá. He interceded for his town-people in the name of his great grandfather, the Prophet, and the Mirzá accepted his intercession. Mirzá Pír Muhammad soon went to Delhi, which place he took and where he was crowned as king. Multan remained in the hands of Langáhs, and Sind in those of the Sammah rulers as before. =Jam Taghlak= Jám Taghlak was fond of hunting and left his brothers to administer the affairs of state at Sehwán and Bakhar. In his reign some Balóch raised the standard of revolt in the outskirts of Bakhar, but Jám Taghlak marched in the direction and punished their ring-leaders and appointed an outpost in each parganah to prevent any future rebellion of the kind. He died after a reign of 28 years. =Jam Sikandar= Jám Sikandar bin Jám Taghlak was a minor when he succeeded his father to the throne. The governors of Sehwán and Bakhar shook off their yoke, and prepared to take offensive steps. Jám Sikandar was obliged to march out from Tattá to Bakhar. When he came as far as Nasarpúr, a man by name Mubárak, who during the last Jám's reign had made himself celebrated for acts of bravery, proclaimed himself king under the name of Jám Mubárak. But as the people were not in league with him, he was driven away within 3 days and information sent to Jám Sikandar, who made peace with his opponents and hastened to Tattá. After a year and a half, he died. =Jam Nizamuddin I= After Jam Salahuddin's death, the nobles of the state put his son Jám Nizámuddín I bin Jám Saláhuddín on the throne. Jam Nizamuddin ruled for only a few months. His first act of kindness was the release of his cousins Sikandar, Karn and Baháuddín and Ámar, who had been placed in captivity by the advice of the ministers. He appointed every one of them as an officer to discharge administrative duties in different places, while he himself remained in the capital, superintending the work done by them and other officials in different quarters of the country. Before long, however, his cousins, very ungratefully made a conspiracy among themselves and stealthily coming to the capital attempted to seize him. But Jám Saláhuddín learning their intention in time, left the place at the dead of night with a handful of men and made his escape to Gujrat. In the morning, men were sent after him, but before any information could be brought about him, the people summoned Alísher, son of Jám Tamáchí, who was living in obscurity, and raised him to the throne. Meanwhile, Jám Nizámuddín also died in his flight and his cousins too being disappointed in every thing, lived roving lives. =Jam Sanjar= On Ráinah's death, Sanjar (Radhan) Sadr al-Din became the Jám of Sind. He is said to have been a very handsome person, and on that account was constantly attended by a large number of persons, who took pleasure in remaining in his company. It is believed that before his coming to the throne, a pious fakír had been very fond of him; that one day Sanjar informed him that he had a very strong desire to become the king of Tattá though it should be for not more than 8 days; and that the fakír had given him his blessings, telling him that he would be the king of the place for 8 years. Jám Sanjar ruled the country very wisely. Under no ruler before this had the people of Sind enjoyed such ease of mind. He was very fond of the company of the learned and the pious. Every Friday he used to distribute charities and had fixed periodical allowances for those who deserved the same. He increased the pay of responsible officers. One Kází Maarúf, who had been appointed by the late rulers to be the Kází of Bakhar, was in the habit of receiving bribes from the plaintiffs as well as from the defendants. When this fact came to the notice of Jám Sanjar, he sent for the Kází and asked him about it. The Kází admitted the whole thing. “Yes” said he “I do demand something from the plaintiffs as well as the defendants, and I am anxious to get something from the witnesses too, but before the case closes, they go away and I am disappointed in that.” Jám Sanjar could not help laughing at this. The Kází continued “I work in the court for the whole day and my wife and children die of hunger at home, because I get very little pay.” Jám Sanjar increased his pay and issued general orders for the increase of every government post of importance. =Jam Nizamuddin II= Jám Nizámuddín II (866–914AH, 1461–1508AD) was the most famous Sultan of the Samma or Jamot dynasty,The Hindu - The world's largest necropolis which ruled in Sindh and parts of Punjab and Balochistan (region) from 1351-1551 CE. He was known by the nickname of Jám Nindó. His capital was at Thatta in modern Pakistan. The Samma Sultanate reached the height of its power during the reign of Jam Nizamuddin II, who is still recalled as a hero, and his rule as a golden age. Shortly after his accession, he went with a large force to Bhakkar, where he spent about a year, during which time he extirpated the freebooters and robbers who annoyed the people in that part of the country. After that, for a period of forty-eight years he reigned at Tatta with absolute power. In the last part of Jám Nindó's reign, after 1490 CE, a Mughul army under Shah Beg Arghun came from Kandahar and fell upon many villages of Chundooha and Sideejuh, invading the town of Ágrí, Ohándukah, Sibi Sindichah and Kót Máchián. Jám Nindó sent a large army under his Vazier Darya Khan[1], which, arriving at the village known by the name of Duruh-i-Kureeb, also known as Joolow Geer or Halúkhar near Sibi, defeated the Mughuls in a pitched battle. Sháh Beg Arghun's brother Abú Muhammad Mirzá was killed in the battle, and the Mughuls fled back to Kandahár, never to return during the reign of Jám Nizámuddín[2]. Jam Nizamuddin's death was followed by a war of succession between the cousins Jam Feroz and Jam Salahuddin. =Jam Feruzudin= Coin during the rule of Jam Feraz Jam Feruz bin Jam Nizam was the last ruler of the Samma dynasty of Sindh. Jám Feróz succeeded his father Jám Nizámuddín at a minor age. Jám Feróz was a young man, and as from the commencement the management of the state affairs was in the hands of his guardian he spent his time in his harem and seldom went out. But he was fearful of his ministers. As a precautionary measure he enlisted in his service Kíbak Arghún and a large number of men belonging to the tribes of Mughuls, who had during his reign, left Sháhbeg Arghún and came to Tattá. Jám Feróz gave them the quarter of the town, called Mughal-Wárah to live in. He secretly flattered himself for his policy in securing the services of intrepid men to check Daryá Khán, but he never for a minute imagined what ruin these very men were destined to bring on him. For, it was through some of these men that Sháhbeg Arghún was induced to invade and conquer Sind in 926 AH (1519 AD) at the Battle of Fatehpur (1519), which resulted in the displacement of the Sammah dynasty of rulers by that of Arghún. Legacy Tombs at Makli The rise of Thatta as an important commercial and cultural centre was directly related to Jam Ninda's patronage and policies. At the time the Portuguese took control of the trading centre of Hormuz in 1514 CE, trade from the Sindh accounted for nearly 10% of their customs revenue, and they described Thatta as one of the richest cities in the world. Thatta's prosperity was based partly on its own high-quality cotton and silk textile industry, partly on export of goods from further inland in the Punjab and northern India. However, the trade declined when the Mughals took over. Later, due to silting of the main Indus channel, Thatta no longer functioned as a port.[The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama by Claude Markovits, 2000 ] The Samma civilization contributed significantly to the evolution of the Indo- Islamic architectural style. Thatta is famous for its necropolis, which covers 10 square km on the Makli Hill. It assumed its quasi-sacred character during Jam Ninda's rule. Every year thousands perform pilgrimage to this site to commemorate the saints buried here. The graves testify to a long period when Thatta was a thriving center of trade, religion and scholarly pursuits.Archnet.org: Thattah See also * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties *Sandhai Muslims References Sources *This article incorporates text from the work A History of Sind by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, a publication now in the public domain. *Islamic culture - Page 429, by Islamic Culture Board *The History and Culture of the Indian People - Page 224, by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bhāratīya Itihāsa Samiti *Searchlights on Baloches and Balochistan, by Mir Khuda Bakhsh Marri *The Delhi Sultanate, by Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Asoke Kumar Majumdar, A.

They claimed their descent and name from Ilkhanid-Mongol Arghun Khan.The Travels of Marco Polo - Complete (Mobi Classics) By Marco Polo, Rustichello of Pisa, Henry Yule (Translator) Arghun rule can be divided into two branches: the Arghun branch of Dhu'l-Nun Beg Arghun that ruled until 1554, and the Tarkhan branch of Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan that ruled until 1591. Arghun governors of Kandahar In the late 15th century the Timurid sultan of Herat, Husayn Bayqarah, appointed Dhu'l-Nun Beg Arghun as governor of Kandahar. Dhu'l-Nun Beg soon began to ignore the authority of the central government in Herat and in around 1479 he began expanding in the direction of Baluchistan, taking over Pishin, Shal and Mustang. In 1485 his sons Shah Beg Arghun and Muhammad Mukim Khan also seized Sibi from the Samma dynasty of Sindh, although this gain was only temporary. In 1497 Dhu'l-Nun Beg threw his support behind the revolt of Husayn Bayqarah's son Badi' al-Zaman against his father. Dhu'l-Nun Beg, who married off his daughter to Badi' al-Zaman, subsequently gained a prominent position in the latter's government when the Timurid succeeded Husayn Bayqarah in Herat in 1506.Babur, Vol. II p. 40 Unfortunately for them, the Uzbeks under Muhammad Shaybani invaded Khorasan shortly after Badi' al-Zaman's ascension. In 1507 Dhu'l-Nun Beg was killed in battle against the Uzbeks and succeeded by his sons Shah Beg and Mukim. Wars with Babur The Arghuns ultimately lost control of their portion of Afghanistan to the Timurid prince Babur, who had been expelled from Transoxiana by the Uzbeks and had made his way south to Husayn Bayqarah's kingdom. In 1501/1502 Mukim had peacefully gained the submission of Kabul, which was in chaos after the death of its ruler Ulugh Beg II.Babur, Vol I, p. 126 This was contested by Babur, who besieged and took the city in 1504; Mukim fell back to Kandahar.Bosworth, \\"Kabul\\" p. 357M After Dhu'l-Nun Beg's death Babur decided that as long as Shah Beg and Mukim remained in Kandahar they would remain a threat to them. In 1507 or 1508 he attacked them, but the brothers saved their position by agreeing to submit to the Uzbek Muhammad Shaybani. In the following years Babur spent his time fighting against the Uzbeks in an attempt to regain Samarkand, giving Shah Beg and Mukim a degree of respite. Shah Beg Arghun, however, seems to have realized that in the long term it would be impossible to hold Kandahar against Babur. In 1520, in the hopes of establishing a new power base, he invaded Sindh, where the Samma dynasty was struggling under Jam Feroz. Shah Beg defeated Jam Feroz's army and proceeded to sack Thatta. The two sides agreed to a peace, where Shah Beg gained the upper half of Sindh (Thatta) while the Sammas retained the lower half (Bukkur). Jam Feroz almost immediately broke this agreement, but was defeated by Shah Beg and forced to flee to Gujarat. This marked the end of Samma rule in Sindh, as Shah Beg gained control of the whole region. Arghun dynasty of Sindh =Arghun branch= In 1522 Babur took Kandahar after a drawn-out siege and annexed it.Bosworth, \\"Kandahar,\\" p. 536 Following this, Shah Beg Arghun made Bukkur (Lower Sindh) his official capital. He died in 1524 and his son Shah Husayn succeeded him. Shah Husayn had the Khutba read in Babur's name and attacked Multan, probably at Babur's insistence. Multan, which was ruled by the Langah, fell in 1528 after an extended siege and Shah Husayn appointed a governor of the city. Shortly after Shah Husayn departed Multan for Thatta, however, the governor was thrown out of the city. The rebels administered Multan for a time independently, but soon afterward submitted to the Mughal Empire, which had been founded by Babur after his capture of Delhi in 1526.Davies, pp. 627-8 In 1540 Shah Husayn had to deal with the arrival of Babur's successor Humayun, who had been expelled from medieval India by Sher Shah Suri. Humayun implored Shah Husayn to provide assistance in fighting against Sher Shah Suri, but was unable to convince him to do so. Sometime after this Humayun later attempted to wrest Sindh from Shah Husayn, but the latter was able to force a stalemate. The Mughal Emperor eventually agreed to leave Sindh and made his way to Kandahar in 1543.Davies, p. 628 Shah Husayn became increasingly incapable of ruling as he approached the end of his life. Because of this, the nobles of Sindh decided to elect Mirza Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan, who was a member of a senior branch of the Arghuns, as their ruler in 1554. Shah Husayn was set aside and died childless in 1556. =Tarkhan branch= During the civil war between Shah Husayn and Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan, the latter had sent a request for the help to the Portuguese at Bassein. A 700-man force under the command of Pedro Barreto Rolim sailed up to Thatta in 1555, only to find that Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan had already won the conflict and there was no need for their assistance. Furious at the governor of Thatta's refusal to pay them, the Portuguese sacked the defenseless city and killed several thousand people.\\"Report of the Western Circle\\" Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan was soon forced to deal with a rival claimant, Sultan Mahmud Kokaltash reverently referred to as Sultan Mahmud Koka. He was eventually compelled to make peace with Sultan Mahmud; the two agreed that Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan would keep lower Sindh, with his capital at Thatta, while Sultan Mahmud would rule upper Sindh from Bakhar. In 1567 Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan died and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Baqi. During the latter's reign upper Sindh was annexed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1573. Mirza Muhammad Baqi committed suicide in 1585, and was succeeded by his son Mirza Jani Beg. In 1591 Akbar sent an army to conquer lower Sindh. Jani Beg put up a resistance but was defeated by the Mughal forces and his principality was annexed. In 1599 he died of delirium tremens.

He is considered one of the forerunners of New Queer Cinema.Glbtq.com Life and career =Early life= Harrington was born on September 17, 1926 in Los Angeles, the son of Isabel (Dorum) and Raymond Stephen Harrington.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QGL4-D6HP He grew up in Beaumont, California. His first cinematic endeavors were amateur films he made while still a teenager. He attended Occidental College and the University of Southern California, then graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a film studies degree. =Career beginnings= He began his career as a film critic, writing a book on Josef von Sternberg in 1948. He directed several avant-garde short films in the 1940s and '50s, including Fragment of Seeking, Picnic, and The Wormwood Star (a film study of the artwork of Marjorie Cameron). Cameron also co-starred in his subsequent film Night Tide (1961) with Dennis Hopper. Harrington worked with Kenneth Anger, serving as a cinematographer on Anger's Puce Moment and acting in Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954) (he played Cesare, the somnambulist). Harrington had links to Thelema shared with his close associates Kenneth Anger and Marjorie Cameron who frequently acted in his films.Obituary for Curtis Harrington in Fortean Times One of Harrington's mentors was avant-garde film pioneer Maya Deren, an initiated voodoo priestess. Roger Corman assigned Harrington to direct two American films and use Russian science fiction film footage in both; the result was Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965) and Queen of Blood (1966), which then led to further films such as Games. He also directed Whoever Slew Auntie Roo? (1971) with Shelley Winters, What's the Matter with Helen? (1971) with Winters and Debbie Reynolds, and Killer Bees (1974) with Gloria Swanson in one of her last film roles. Harrington made two made-for-television movies based on screenplays by Robert Bloch: The Cat Creature (1973) and The Dead Don't Die (1975) . =Later films= Harrington had a cameo role in Orson Welles's unfinished The Other Side of the Wind (1970-1976). Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Harrington directed episodes of popular television series such as Baretta, Dynasty, Wonder Woman, The Twilight Zone and Charlie's Angels. Harrington was the driving force in rediscovering the original James Whale production of The Old Dark House (1932, Universal Pictures). Even though the rights had been sold to Columbia Pictures for a remake, he got George Eastman House to restore the negative. On the Kino International DVD, there is a filmed interview of Harrington's explaining why and how this came about (the contract stipulated that they were allowed to save the film only, not release it, essentially to prove that there was no profit motive). Harrington was an advisor on Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters, about the last days of director James Whale, because Harrington had known Whale at the end of his life. Harrington also has a cameo in this film. Harrington's final film, the short Usher, is a remake of Fall of the House of Usher, an unreleased film he did while in high school. His casting of Nikolas and Zeena Schreck in his updated version of Edgar Allan Poe's ”The Fall of the House of Usher” is in keeping with the magical thread that runs through the filmmaker's career. Financing of the film was partly accomplished through the Shrecks' brokering of the sale of Harrington's signed copy of Crowley's The Book of Thoth. Death Harrington died on May 6, 2007, of complications from a stroke he suffered in 2005. He is interred in the Cathedral Mausoleum at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.Wilson, Scott.

He was born in the Netherlands and died near Veracruz after being wounded on the Isla de Sacrificios. Nikolaas or Klaas was engaged in the Dutch merchant service from about 1655 until 1659, and then bought a vessel with his savings. With a band of reckless men whom he had enlisted, he became a terror to the commerce of the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire. Later he had several ships in his employment and obtained such notoriety that some governments were willing to employ him against their enemies.  As a privateer  In 1666 a French minister sent Van Hoorn a commission, empowering him to pursue and capture Spanish vessels. As he was uniformly successful, he amassed enormous sums. After the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, it was expected that he would cease ravaging the American coast - but the French government, while openly disowning their champion, secretly connived at his misdeeds. He made the mistake of pillaging a French ship, but after an unsuccessful attempt to take him was made in 1663, he no longer attacked the French flag. Learning that several Spanish galleons were waiting in the harbour of Puerto Rico for a convoy, he entered the harbour and offered his services to the governor. He put forward his recent quarrel with the French, and declared that his only chance of safety was in the protection of Charles II of Spain. The governor allowed the galleons to leave port under the protection of Van Hoorn, but, as soon as they were outside the Antilles, they were attacked by the flotilla of the buccaneer, who gained over 2,000,000 livres by the adventure.  As a pirate  At end of 1682, the Saint Nicholas, commanded by Nicolas Van Hoorn, arrived in the Caribbean Sea. This vessel, armed (in part) by the commander of Dover Castle, had left England the previous year, intending to trade with the Spaniards in Cadiz then in America. Nicolas Porcio, who was one of the holders of Asiento - a royal licence granting monopoly over the draft of the slaves for the Spanish colonies - had apparently promised to obtain for Van Hoorn the permission to sell him Africans in Spanish America. Said promise could not be fulfilled and Van Hoorn sought alternate employ. Van Hoorn was then transformed into a true pirate. He plundered the coast of Western Africa expecting to be supplied with slaves, as the depositions of four of his men reveal. These depositions, taken in front of Reginald Wilson, the naval officer of Port Royal, were transmitted by the governor of Jamaica, Sir Thomas Lynch, to the secretary of the committee for the Trade and the Plantations, William Blathwayt, with his letter of 4 March 1683. Indeed, before the arrival of Van Hoorn in America, the English colonial authorities had been informed of his piracies in Africa, and - more seriously - the fact that the Saint Nicholas had openly broken with its British ship-owners to act on Van Hoorn's own account. Thus, cruising against the forbans of the Antilles on order of the Governor Lynch, Jamaican captain George Johnson fell on Van Hoorn, in December 1682, but could not demand any account nor explanation. The president of the Royal Audience of Santo Domingo indeed prohibited Johnson from any contact with Van Hoorn. The reason was simple: the president retained the Saint Nicholas, for a flight made from Cadiz by his captain, for whom what remained in African slaves was confiscated. All this made Van Hoorn determined to gain the French part of the Hispaniola Island, to take a commission from its governor Pouançey and to assemble the famous forwarding of Vera Cruz. Van Hoorn was engaged with Laurens de Graaf and Michel de Grammont in the capture of Veracruz in 1683. After the sacking of Veracruz, the two retreated to Isla de Sacrificios with prisoners where they planned to wait for ransom payments. Impatient that payments did not arrive immediately, Van Hoorn ordered the execution of a dozen prisoners and had their heads sent to Veracruz as a warning. De Graaf was furious; the two argued and then fought a duel. Van Hoorn received a minor wound and was returned to his ship in shackles. The wound soon turned gangrenous and Van Hoorn died shortly thereafter. Notes References *P.R.O. Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series: America and West Indies, 1681-1685: no. 1163.

The idea of the series was that the ghosts of the murdered would tell the story of their murders. George Kelting was the storyteller and acted as the ghost, wearing white make-up and having a towel draped over his head. Due to the technical limitations of the time the visual effects were not impressive—the camera showed only George Kelting's head.

The name Bar-le-duc refers to the geographical origin of the preparation in the French town of Bar-le-duc. Since the jelly's first documented reference in 1344, the culinary name \\"Lorraine jelly\\" is occasionally used, as the city of Bar-le-duc lies within the boundaries of the former province of Lorraine. Commonly served as an accompaniment to game, spread on bread, or with foie gras, it is considered a culinary luxury, sharing an elite status akin to Beluga caviar and is colloquially referred to as Bar caviar. The typical product is a jam, with the berries remaining intact in a thin syrup. About 200 currants go into one 85 gram jar (approximately 3 ounces), which costs approximately €15 a jar in Bar-le-Duc and $40 in the US (). The spread has been enjoyed by notables such as Alfred Hitchcock, Ernest Hemingway, Victor Hugo, and Mary, Queen of Scots.  Examples  the House of Dutriez in the town of Bar-le-Duc provides one of the very few hand-made preparations still on the market, la confiture de Groseilles de Bar le Duc (Currant Preserve). The traditionally hand-made product involves épépineurs or épépineuses (seed extractors) de-seeding the currants with goose quills to flick out the tiny seeds without disturbing the flesh of the small fruit. Sometimes sweetened jellies, consisting of mashed and sieved currants of a significantly lower cost and quality, appear on the market under the same name. When Rex Stout's fictional detective Nero Wolfe deals with the distraught daughter of his bootblack in Kill Now—Pay Later, he suspects hunger, as much as the shock of her father's death, is responsible for her emotional instability, and tells his cook, \\"Tea with honey, Fritz. Toast, pot cheese, and Bar-le-Duc. For Miss Vassos\\", strengthening Wolfe's reputation as a gourmet and establishing the high regard in which he held her father.

Geography  It is located 937 km southwest from the city of Buenos Aires, on the north bank of the Río Negro (\\"Black River\\"), near the Atlantic Ocean, and opposite Viedma, capital of the province of Río Negro. The city is the capital of the Patagones Partido, the only administrative division of Buenos Aires Province that lies within Patagonia.  History  An old corner of the town The town was founded in 1779 by Francisco de Viedma, an explorer leading a Spanish expedition commissioned with colonizing Patagonia's shores. In the 19th century, Carmen de Patagones had a fort, and after the May Revolution of 1810, it became a prison for royalists (Spaniards and pro-Spanish locals against the independence movement). Later, during the Cisplatine War (1825-1828), the town became a naval base, since the main Argentine safe harbour, the estuary of the Río de la Plata, had been blocked by Brazilian ships. The Brazilian troops attempted to take Carmen de Patagones, but they were repelled by armed residents on 7 March 1827; this date is still commemorated with a festival in the city. The city maintains two imperial Brazilian flags captured during the battle in the central cathedral on the site of the original fort where the battle took place. The town and its twin city, Viedma, became the focus of attention in 1986, when President Raúl Alfonsín announced the Patagonia Project, which envisaged the transfer of the nation's capital to a new federal district encompassing the two towns at the mouth of the Río Negro. Approved by the Congress in 1987, the plan was rescinded when Alfonsín's successor, President Carlos Menem, disbanded Entecap, the commission overseeing the project, in 1989.

In 1970 there were only three formal schools with 900 students in the whole country. Oman's national educational program expanded rapidly during the 1970s and the 1980s. In 2006–2007 about 560,000 students attended 1053 public schools. The number of students in private schools is about 65,000. There are also extensive programmes to combat adult illiteracy. Sultan Qaboos University, the only national university near Muscat, was founded in 1986, and in 2006 it had 13,500 students. The Human Development Report found the literacy rate to be 93.0% in adults, up from 54.7% in 1990. For the same period, the youth literacy rate increased from 85.6 to 97.3%. Public expenditure on education was reported to be 4.6% of GDP and 26.1% of total government spending. Pre- school education Pre school education is provided to children less than 10 years old. It is offered by the private sector and some public organizations. Supervision is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs. Nursery enrollment is very limited and estimated to be only 1%. Kindergarten is available mostly in large cities and enrollment is estimated to be 15%. Attendance usually extends from 8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the teacher being free to organize this period as she deems appropriate between school learning and artistic and leisure activities. The Ministry of Education is in the process of finalizing the advanced curriculum for the kindergarten level, based on self-learning as a method and centered on the Omani child and on his/her environment, cultural heritage and civilization. Basic education In 1997, the ministry began development work on a Basic Education programme to gradually replace the three level General Education system. The aim of the reform is to create a unified system covering the first ten years of schooling. Basic Education is organized into two cycles: the first cycle covers grades 1 to 4 and the second cycle covers grades 5 to 10. These two cycle are followed by two years of post-Basic Education system (secondary education). The first schools started to introduce the new system in the academic year 1998/1999. Secondary education Lasts for three years or you can graduate at any time. Oman retains a number of grammar schools of international renown and a majority of which are private educational establishments offering Classics beyond Latin and Greek to include the ancient literary studies of Sanskrit, Hebrew and Arabic. Notable ones include Al Sahwa Schools, The American International School of Muscat, Pakistan School Muscat, Pakistan School Salalah, Indian School Muscat, American British Academy, the British School Muscat, the Indian School Al Ghubra and The Sultan's School. Higher education The Omani higher education system is relatively young, as the first public university in Oman, Sultan Qaboos University was founded in 1986. Prior to the establishment of SQU, the government sent some students to pursue higher education studies in neighboring Arab countries like UAE, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt. Also some students were awarded scholarships to study in the UK and America. SQU is self-administered and has nine colleges. The colleges of Arts and Social Sciences, Commerce and Economics, Education, Law, and Nursing offer bachelor's and some master's degrees. Starting from September 2008, SQU began introducing PhD studies in its colleges of Agriculture and Marine Sciences, Medicine and Health Sciences, Engineering, and Science. A bachelor's degree takes about five years, as the first is spent studying English, and the second studying relevant science subjects; the last three years are dedicated to core degree units. A medicine degree takes seven years. The public university is normally visited by Omanis only. Expatriates go - as a general rule - to private universities or study abroad. Oman's Ministry of Higher Education administers the six Colleges of Applied Sciences. These were formerly colleges of education, but in 2005 Royal Decree No. 62/2007 was issued to transform them to better cater to the current labor market in fields such as international business administration, communication, design, engineering, and IT. They are located in Ibri, Nizwa, Salalah, Sohar, Sur, and Rustaq. The College of Applied Sciences in Rustaq is the only one that still offers an education degree. The Ministry also has a department that sanctions private colleges and universities. Oman Tourism College (OTC) was established in 2001, by the Government of Oman i.e. the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Tourism. Oman's Ministry of Manpower operates the Higher College of Technology in Muscat and six colleges of technology in Al-Mussana, Ibra, Ibri, Nizwa, Salalah, and Shinas. The Ministry of Health runs a number of health institutes to prepare assisting medical staff like nurses, paramedics and pharmacists. The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs sanctions the College of Sharia Sciences. The Central Bank of Oman sanctions the College of Banking and Financial Studies. As the number of students finishing secondary school goes up each year (44,000 were expected to finish in 2008), SQU and other public colleges have become unable to cope with the demand. Since private colleges were very limited in the mid nineties, more and more students sought higher education in countries like the UAE, Jordan and Egypt. The government became aware of the trend and decided to encourage the private sector in Oman to form universities and colleges. The first private college was established in 1994. Since this date, a number of private colleges and universities have been started in Oman. Most of them focus on popular studies such as business administration and computer sciences. They are usually affiliated with European, Australian or American institutions. The language of instruction is mainly English. A’Sharqiya University, in Ibra, opened its doors in the fall of 2010. In the year 2003, Oman's Ministry of Higher Education approved the merger of five private run colleges in order to form the Muscat University. However, the plan to merge Fire Safety Engineering College, Majan College, Modern College of Business & Science, Middle East College and Mazoon College for Management and Applied Sciences failed (source: Oman Observer 18.7.2005). Currently, there is some talk that the plan to form Muscat University may be revived. As part of the eOman initiative, applications for 2006/2007 higher education (public and private) places have been merged under one unified online system (Higher Education Admissions Center). Each higher education institute publishes the minimum entry requirement for each of its degrees and the student selects his or her choices in order of preference. When the Ministry of Education publishes secondary school results in mid July, these results are fed automatically into the system and offers are made in early August. Prior to the new system, the students had to submit their papers to the different institutes by themselves after the publication of results. The process was very inconvenient for the students and the admission departments as there was very little time and students had to travel a lot.

For there, surrounded by countryside, was a manor house built in stone - quite different from the many wattle and daub buildings that were normally found. And so the area was named \\"Stanhus\\" in the book. Today, that name has little changed: from Stanhus to Stonehouse. William De Ow owned the manor. On site, there were two mills - where still industry continues to this day - and a vineyard. There is a possibility that the Romans, who introduced the grape into England, had planted the vineyard. That old manor saw some life over the many years it stood, a symbol for the town. One of its masters, John Maltravers, was found guilty of involvement in the brutal murder of Edward II of England in Berkeley Castle in 1327. He had to flee abroad where he remained for many years.

History Not much is known of their early lives. Duke was born in Kent in 1563. The other three came from Yorkshire (Hogg from Cleveland) but their dates of birth are unknown. They all arrived in the mid-1580s at the English College at Rheims to study for the priesthood. Duke arrived in Rheims on 3 March 1583 and was ordained to minor orders there on 23 September 1583. He was subsequently was sent to Rome and entered the English College there on 22 August 1584.\\"The Durham Martyrs\\", The Catholic Parish of The Durham Martyrs He was ordained to the priesthood in the Lateran Basilica on 3 September 1589. Leaving the city for England, he set out on 15 September and on 15 October reached Rheims. Holiday arrived on 6 September 1584, Hill on 15 May 1587, and Hogg on 15 October 1587. The three were together ordained subdeacons at Soissons on 18 March 1589, by Bishop Jérôme Hennequin, deacons 27 May and priests 23 September at Laon by Bishop Valentine Douglas, O.S.B.. Hill, Holiday, Hogg and Duke were all sent on the English mission on 22 March 1590 but aroused suspicion by keeping together as a band and were arrested in County Durham soon after landing in the North of England. Given the 1585 Act making it a capital offence to be a Catholic priest in England the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was inevitable. The trial was at Durham and the sentence was carried out there. According to legend, \\"After the execution, it was noticed that a small stream near the site had completely dried up, and so the area is known as 'Dryburn' to this day.\\"\\"Northern Saints and Martyrs\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle With the priests were executed four common criminals felons, who declared that they, too, died Catholics. In the crowd were a good number of Catholics and reportedly when the priests' heads were as customary cut off and held up, only the officers and a Protestant minister or two would say \\"God save the Queen\\". It is also said that two Protestant spectators, Robert Maire and his wife Grace Maire, were converted to the Catholic faith. Unusually the record of the event has survived in the registers of St Oswald's parish, Durham.

Several albums have gone Gold and Platinum, while she has won major international music awards. Biography Born in Cape Verde, Suzanna Lubrano and her parents moved to the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands when she was four. She started to sing when she was still a young child, but picked up singing professionally when she was eighteen. She made her debut as a professional singer in the popular Cape Verdean band Rabelados. Together with Rabelados she recorded a very successful CD album. In the meantime Suzanna had already started a solo career, resulting in three solo CDs: her debut Sem bó nes mund, the successful follow up Fofó – including the megahit Ohi Li Oh La – and Tudo pa bo. On Tudo pa bo (Everything for you) Suzanna is not only working with Jorge do Rosario, Dabs Lopes and Beto Dias, as she has done on her previous albums, but also started a cooperation with Ronald Rubinel, who had previously asked Suzanna to participate on his Jeux de Dames and Zouk me Love CDs. In 2004 she released the song Silêncio on a single CD. This song was not only released in Cape Verdean Creole, but also in English and Dutch. The song was written for a sad occasion: a 13-year-old Cape Verdean boy from the Dutch port city of Rotterdam murdered on the street in broad day light while playing in the snow with his friends. In summer 2007, Suzanna's new single Gone was released, the first single from her upcoming album Saida, released in 2008. The Saida album contains 19 songs: Zouk Love/Kizomba tracks, written in cooperation with Ronald Rubinel (Edith Lefel) and Jacob Desvarieux (Kassav'), acoustic songs, written together with Marcos Fernandez, Kim Alves and others, and a couple of R&B; tracks in English, written in cooperation with producer Marcus \\"DL\\" Sisklind, Ryan Toby, Dre Robinson and others. The Saida album is released by Mass Appeal Entertainment. Most of the songs are recorded at the Blue Jay Recording Studio, owned by Kevin Richardson, formerly of the Backstreet Boys and Saida's producer Marcus \\"DL\\" Siskind. In May 2009, Suzanna Lubrano released her fifth soloalbum, Festa Mascarado. It is a predominantly Zouk and Zouk R&B; album, with sidesteps to Bachata and Batuku. On Festa Mascarado Suzanna has collaborations with Ronald Rubinel, Marcus Fernandez, Rafael Payan, Nellson Klasszik, Adalberto Lopes, Denis Graca and others. The album also includes a rap of the late Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes. In June 2010, Suzanna Lubrano released her first DVD, \\"Live at Off-Corso\\", featuring Dutch saxophone player Candy Dulfer as a special guest. \\"Live at Off-Corso\\" originally was a TV concert which has been televised in numerous countries, including Brazil, Portugal and many others. In December 2011, Suzanna Lubrano launched her new single Ca Bu Para, and in April 2012 the song Tardi di Mas, produced by Giorgio Tuinfort. In 2011 and 2013 Suzanna Lubrano released compilation albums, including a number of new songs. In 2015, Suzanna released the ´Vitoria´ album, including duets with Machel Montano (Trinidad), Iyanya (Nigeria) and Vinicius D´black (Brazil. Achievements and other highlights In December 2003 Suzanna won the prestigious Kora All African Music Award for both Best West African Female and Best African Female at an event watched by 600 million TV viewers worldwide. She was the first and until now only Cape Verdean artist to win this prestigious award, as well as the first and until now only Netherlands based artist. She was personally congratulated by both the Capeverdean President and Prime Minister, the mayor of her home city in the Netherlands, Rotterdam, as well as the Dutch Minister of Development Cooperation. Suzanna Lubrano is a Capeverdean diplomatic passport holder and the Godmother of a new Boeing of TACV Cape Verdean Airlines. Other awards include a Cabo Music Award for best singer and best duo. In June 2010, Suzanna won the Museke Online African Music Award for best African Artist based in the Diaspora. In March 2011 she was the most awarded female solo artist at the first Cabo Verde Music Awards winning two awards for \\"Festa Mascarado\\" Throughout the years, Suzanna Lubrano has received Gold and Platinum albums in Africa for various releases. Suzanna Lubrano's \\"Live at Off-Corso TV Concert\\" has been transmitted by many national TV networks in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In 2012, Suzanna Lubrano was nominated again for the Kora Awards (Best West-African Female Artist), in 2015 for the African Entertainment Awards, and in 2016 for African Album of the Year and Best West-African Female Artist at the Kora All Africa Music Awards.

It is found in the open fields and grasslands of tropical Asia and is popular as a cage bird due to the colourful plumage of the males in their breeding season. It breeds in the Indian Subcontinent in the monsoon season. The species name of amandava and the common name of avadavat are derived from the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India, from where these birds were exported into the pet trade in former times. Description Female with red rump visibleThis small finch is easily identified by the rounded black tail and the bill that is seasonally red. The rump is red and the breeding male is red on most of the upper parts except for a black eye-stripe, lower belly and wings. There are white spots on the red body and wing feathers. The non-breeding male is duller but has the red-rump while the female is duller with less of the white spotting on the feathers. Evolution and systematics The red avadavat were earlier included in the genus Estrilda by Jean Delacour. This placement was followed for a while but morphological, behavioural, biochemical and DNA studies now support their separation in the genus Amandava. The Estrildinae are thought to have evolved somewhere in the Indian plate and moving into the African and Pacific regions and it has been estimated that the red munia diverged from the green munia about 9 million years ago. Habitat and distribution Red avadavats are found mainly on flat plains, in places with tall grasses or crops, often near water. The species has four named subspecies. The nominate subspecies is called amandava and is found in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan; the Burmese form is called flavidiventris (also found in parts of China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam); the population further east in Java is called punicea and in Cambodia, decouxi. Introduced populations exist in southern Spain, Brunei, Fiji, Egypt, Malaysia, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore and Hawaii. Behaviour and ecology left This finch is usually seen in small flocks, flying with rapid wingbeats and descending into grass clumps where they are hard to observe. Pairs stay together during the breeding season. These birds produce a distinctive low single note pseep call that is often given in flight. The song is a series of low notes. Birds of a flock will preen each other, ruffling their head feathers in invitation. They feed mainly on grass seeds but will also take insects such as termites when they are available. They build a globular nest made of grass blades. The usual clutch is about five or six white eggs. The beak begins to turn red in May and darkens during November and December. The beak then turns rapidly to black in April and the cycle continues. These seasonal cycles are linked to seasonal changes in daylength. Two ectoparasitic species of bird lice (an ischnoceran, Brueelia amandavae, and an amblyceran, Myrsidea amandava) have been identified living on them and a paramyxovirus has been isolated from birds kept in Japan.

Elbows can be thrown sideways similarly to a hook, upwards similarly to an uppercut, downwards with the point of the elbow, diagonally or in direct movement and in several other ways, like during a jump. Elbowing is a disallowed practice in most combat sports. However, Lethwei, Muay Thai, Pradal serey and several mixed martial arts (MMA) organizations do allow elbowing, or allow elbowing in a specific manner. The mixed martial arts organizations disallowing it usually do so because elbowing the head increases the risk of lacerations in a fight. While elbows are mostly disallowed in most modern combat sports, they are common in traditional martial arts. There are few traditional martial arts that don't use elbows though it depends on which martial art it is, if the elbows are primary or secondary weapons and also in which manner, what tactics and how often they are used. Some well known and respected traditional martial arts that use elbows are Karate, Hung Ga, Bajiquan, Wing Chun, Silat, Lethwei and Muay boran. In Muay Thai, elbow strikes are most often used while in close range but are also employed while jumping toward the opponent,(Montho Nang tan) similar to Muay Thai's flying knee. The hardness of the elbow allows for hitting with considerable force, and experienced fighters can easily knock out, cut, or injure their opponent with a well-placed strike. Elbows are generally most effective when used in combination with punches or kicks to allow the fighter to close the distance. Elbows are also used in mixed martial arts as part of the ground-and-pound fighting tactic. Participants often use elbow strikes in conjunction with punches while in the full guard, half guard, side mount, or full mount in order to knock out or overwhelm the opponent. In ice hockey, elbowing an opposing player is considered a rules infraction, resulting in a two-minute penalty for the offending player, leaving his team short handed. In basketball, elbowing a player, or \\"throwing 'bows,\\" counts as a foul. Injuries An improper elbow strike, or an elbow strike without proper conditioning can partially paralyze the striker's hand. The ulnar nerve runs posterior to the elbow (posterior to medial epicondyle of the humerus and innervates the medial portion of the arm). For example, after an improper strike, or if the striker is not properly conditioned, the user may not be able to use the 4th and 5th digit temporarily. There may be a chance for permanent damage to the ulnar nerve with an elbow strike. Conditioning This can be done in several ways, the easiest way is to practice elbow strikes on something like a punching bag/Muay Thai pad/flash pad, after a few weeks of this regularly one will develop thicker, tougher skin on the elbow resulting in it being harder to cut or tear your skin while delivering elbow strikes. These activities will also make the surrounding tissue harder to bruise due to buildup of scar tissue in the striking point of the elbow from elbow strikes. It is not recommended to strike solid objects for conditioning as micro- fractures in bone or other tissue tend to be a risk factor for repetitive strains or even more acute problems. 12-6 elbow A \\"12-6 elbow\\" is a strike that is brought from a high position (\\"12 o'clock\\") and travels vertically toward the floor (\\"6 o'clock\\"), dropping the point of the elbow directly on the target. This type of elbow is illegal in all MMA organizations that use the Unified Rules. References =Main reference= * Løvstad, Jakob. The Mixed Martial Arts Primer. www.idi.ntnu.no.

The War of the Ring was Games Workshop's annual summer campaign for 2005. The campaign was named after the eponymous War of the Ring in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and was the first to feature The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game as its wargaming system. The campaign allowed registered participants to play miniature wargames using special \\"regional rules\\" for any one of thirteen regions of Middle-earth, and to submit the results to the campaign website. The results were then added up on the website, contributing to the overall result of the campaign. The campaign was launched on 1 June 2005 and lasted 14 weeks (or 92 days). There were 3007 registered participants, and 27239 games were submitted. Although based in the United Kingdom, the campaign was open to all countries and was promoted in Games Workshop hobby centres worldwide. The campaign also received coverage in the monthly magazine White Dwarf and the fortnightly Battle Games in Middle-earth, and Games Workshop released the special \\"Gimli on Dead Uruk- hai\\" miniature to promote the event. Campaign =Structure= The campaign system was designed by Mathew Ward.Cavatore, p 98 Based on the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, the only two sides were \\"Good\\" and \\"Evil\\", who contested thirteen regions set in Middle-earth: Eriador, Angmar, Iron Hills, Mirkwood, Misty Mountains, Dunland & Isengard, Lothlórien & Fangorn, Rohan, Rhûn, Gondor, Mordor, Harad and the Fellowship Path.Cavatore, p 99 Each day, registered participants could submit the results of a tabletop battle- game played using special \\"regional rules\\" for any one of these regions. The website's \\"War Room\\" was updated each weekday at 10:00 GMT, and showed where each side was leading. At the end of each week, the wins would be tallied and \\"Victory Points\\" would be awarded to each side to determine who was winning over all. There was also an internet forum for each side on the website, where participants could discuss strategies for swinging the regions in their side's favour. These were moderated by Steve Hammatt, who was at the time forum moderator on the main Games Workshop website. Hammatt assisted the running of the campaign both by making announcements and answering player's questions, and by passing on player feedback to the campaign organisers. There were also two \\"player created strategy groups\\" formed mid-campaign, the Alliance of Light and the Dark Council, who received particular mention and thanks from Games Workshop in White Dwarf. Games Workshop also introduced the \\"Wrath of Umbar\\" Roadshow, with custom-built corsair models and gaming boards being brought to various cities in the United Kingdom. =Progress of the campaign= The map of Middle-earth used for recording battles in the \\"War Room\\" The campaign started with what was later called \\"a solid series of victories for Good\\", insofar as Harad was the only region to remain under Evil control at the end of the first week. It was worried that the campaign was going to be a walkover, but the Evil side clawed their way back and took many of Good's most strongly held regions. Rohan, a \\"seemingly impregnable\\" stronghold for the Good side, had \\"an interesting few weeks where everyone piled in their results\\": over 600 games were entered in Week 8 alone causing it to swing unexpectedly to the Evil side.Cavatore, p 98-99 In particular, the Dark Council directed the forces of Evil and was noted at the time for \\"playing like professionals\\". (Compressed article) The number of miniature wargames played in a single week peaked at the end of Week 9, with both sides submitting approximately 1400 victories each. At the end of Week 11, Evil came to within two points of the Good side. In Week 14, the last events of the Wrath of Umbar Roadshow were run in Sheffield, Liverpool, Shrewsbury, Croydon and Ipswich; while the week was also characterised by \\"spectacular results\\" for Good in Mordor and Morannon. The outcome was a narrow overall victory of 145 Victory Points for Good and 142 for Evil. =Results= At the end of the campaign, there were 3007 registered participants, while results from a total of 27239 battle games played were submitted. Gondor was the most popular region for input, with 10327 games recorded. The highest peak of any region in a single week was an attempt to take Rohan from Evil in Week 9, with the results of over 650 tabletop games submitted. There was also an unprecedented rush for Good to retake Mordor in the final week, with Mordor and the Fellowship Path attracting the most games in that period. When the Campaign formally ended on 8 September, there were 27239 games recorded in total. The Iron Hills had remained an undefeated stronghold for Good, with 67% of games there being Good victories. Evil's strongest bastion was in Angmar, with 59% of games being Evil victories. Good had emerged the victor with 145 Victory Points (Evil had 142). Aftermath The campaign received a positive response, both in participation and comments by mail. Alessio Cavatore, one of the designers of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game and a contributor to White Dwarf, described the campaign as a \\"fantastic rollercoaster\\", with a \\"perfect ending\\" in a \\"highly climatic , breathtaking, neck-and-neck result!\\" Later in 2005, Games Workshop ran a similar, smaller War of the Ring campaign based in Canada. However, this was nowhere near the scale of its UK counterpart (with only 100 games recorded in Gondor, for example) and was ignored by many who viewed it as a \\"watered-down\\" version of the original. In December, Alessio Cavatore hinted that Games Workshop might eventually run another online campaign for The Lord of the Rings: There has been no official sequel event to date. However, the Dark Council went on to run an unofficial \\"Campaign of LoTRs\\" with Cheeseweb; while a campaign was run by The Last Alliance website and another was in development on The One Ring. The Dark Council itself was ultimately closed in summer 2007 after a long period inactivity.

He was eventually expelled from the Senate by Cato the Elder. Early career and the Second Macedonian War A member of the patrician gens Quinctia, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was the brother of Titus Quinctius Flamininus. He was elected Curule aedile in 201 BC,Broughton, pg. 320 and in 199 BC, he served as Praetor urbanus.Broughton, pg. 327 In the following year (198 BC), his praetorial imperium was prorogued by the Senate, initially to take on the task of allocating land in Italy for veterans who had served in Hispania.Brennan, T. Corey, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic, Volume 1 (2000), pg. 208 However, his brother Titus ensured that he was given a propraetoral command in charge of a fleet around Greece, and made responsible for securing the Italian coastal regions during the Second Macedonian War.Broughton, pg. 332; Smith, pg. 161Livy (33.17.2) refers to Flamininus as a legatus Flamininus initially sailed to Corcyra, and having the fleet handed over to him by his predecessor Lucius Apustius near the island of Zama, he travelled slowly from Cape Maleas to Piraeus, to join the ships which had been stationed there for the protection of Athens.Smith, pgs. 161-162 Soon after he was joined by the allied fleets of Attalus I of Pergamon and Rhodes, and Flamininus used them in besieging Eretria, which was occupied by Macedonian forces. He eventually took the town during a night-time assault, during which the citizens surrendered. Flamininus came away with a large collection of art works as his share of the booty after the fall of Eretria.Smith, pg. 162 Word of his victory quickly spread, and Carystus surrendered to him without Flamininus having to lift a finger against it. Having secured possession of the two principal towns of the island of Euboea, Flamininus set sail for Cenchreae, and began to prepare for the siege of Corinth. Although he was able to take Cenchreae, he was beaten back when he tried to overrun the Corinthian defences. After receiving instructions from his brother, the proconsul in charge of the war, Flamininus sent ambassadors to the Achaean League, asking for their support in the war. Most of the city-states came over to the Roman side, joining Flamininus in the siege of Corinth. When the Achaean forces joined his legions, the troops under his command managed to equal the number of defenders in the city, who included a large number of Italians who had deserted the Romans during the Second Punic War. In the end Flamininus was unable to break through their defences, and he was forced to abandon the siege. He returned to his fleet and set sail for Corcyra, where he stationed himself during the winter. In 197 BC, he was appointed as Legate under his brother's command, with the continued command of the Roman fleet, a position he continued to hold until 194 BC.Broughton, pgs. 334 and 345 His first act was to accompany his brother to a conference with the Tyrant Nabis at Argos. Just prior to the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus learned of the decision of Acarnania to join up with Philip V of Macedon, and so he set sail to blockade the city of Leucas. After a brief resistance, the Romans stormed the town, and massacred a large number of Acarnanians, who were determined not to surrender. It was only after news of the Roman victory at Cynoscephalae that the rest of Acarnania submitted to Flamininus. In 195 BC, Flamininus again supported his brother by providing a squadron of 40 ships to accompany his brother's campaign against Nabis of Sparta. Flamininus captured a number of coastal towns by force, whilst some others voluntarily opened their gates to him, before he started to blockade Gythium by sea, while his brother eventually arrived to begin the landward siege. Eventually the town was betrayed to the Romans by Gorgopas. Consulship In 193 BC, Flamininus was back in Italy, where he stood for election for the consulship of 192 BC. His principal opponent was Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, whose candidature was supported by the hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus. However, as Flamininus was supported by his brother Titus, who had just celebrated a triumph for their victory over Philip of Macedon, Titus was able to use his auctoritas to help his brother win the election, while his colleague was Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus.Pelikan Pittenger, Miriam Ruth, Contested Triumphs: Politics, Pageantry, and Performance in Livy's Republican Rome (2008), pg. 189 He was placed in charge of the holding of the Comitia elections, and was granted Cisalpine Gaul as his consular province, while Italy was assigned to both consuls.Polo, Francisco Pina, The Consul at Rome: The Civil Functions of the Consuls in the Roman Republic (2011), pgs. 199-200 On his way north, he was involved in fighting against the Ligures.Broughton, pg. 350 In the vicinity of Pisa he defeated them in battle, reportedly killing around 9,000 of the enemy, as the rest retreated to their fortified camp, which Flamininus proceeded to besiege. During the night the Ligures made their escape, and Flamininus took the empty camp the following morning. He then advanced into the territory of the Boii, which he proceeded to ravage. Towards the end of his consulship, the Senate decided that elections should be held as soon as possible. They therefore directed Flamininus to temporarily relinquish command of his legions in the north and return to Rome. Obeying the directive, on his way to the city he issued an edict calling for the elections.Polo, Francisco Pina, The Consul at Rome: The Civil Functions of the Consuls in the Roman Republic (2011), pg. 88 When the elections were over, Flamininus returned north to continue harassing the Boii, who soon submitted to him. Upon his return to Rome at the end of his consulship, the Senate ordered him to levy a new army, in order that the incoming consuls could have a force ready should a war begin against Antiochus III the Great. For the following year, he was appointed a legate under the new consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, who fought in Greece with the outbreak of the Roman–Syrian War.Broughton, pg. 355 He was eventually replaced by Cato the Elder and Lucius Valerius Flaccus.Grainger, John D., The Roman War of Antiochos the Great (2002), pg. 237 Expulsion from the Senate and death In 184 BC Flamininus was expelled from the Senate by the Censor, Cato the Elder, reportedly for unbecoming conduct during his consulship. In a speech before the Senate, Cato accused Flamininus of a number of charges. According to Livy, who says he had access to a speech by Cato on the matter, Flamininus had been jokingly enticed by his young male lover and prostitute, Phillipus the Carthaginian, to make up for dragging Phillipus away from Rome and missing the Gladiatorial games, upon which Flamininus had a Celt seeking asylum called in and ran him through personally with his gladius. In another version endorsed by later writers, the lover is female.Bauman, Richard, Human Rights in Ancient Rome (2002), pg. 52 Everitt goes on to explain, on page 448, \\"There are variations on this story, one being that the boy was a girl, another that the man killed was a condemned criminal rather than a distinguished Celt, a third that the prostitute requested the execution and, finally, that the deed was done by the lictor, not the consul himself. However in his account of the affair, Livy (39.42) claims to have read the speech Cato made about the affair, and there is no reason to doubt him. Cato's version is likely to be the nearest to the truth.\\"Everitt, Anthony (2012). The Rise of Rome: The Making of the World's Greatest Empire. Published by Random House. Regardless of the theatrical accusations, the reality was that Flamininus' removal from the Senate was a part of a larger struggle between the oligarchic party of the Scipios and their opponents, led by Cato. Determined to curtail the influence of Scipio Africanus and prevent the rise of an oligarchic system within the Republic, Cato had decided to make an example of certain prominent members of the oligarchical party, the most prominent of whom was Lucius Quinctius Flamininus.Homo, Léon Pol, Roman Political Institutions: From City to State (1929), pg. 109 Even with his expulsion from the Senate, Flamininus remained popular with the people of Rome. Initially, once news of his removal had circulated, a contio (public meeting) was held to discuss the matter, where Cato gave a speech defending his actions in expelling Flamininus. Flamininus refused Cato's offer to vindicate himself by means of a sponsio.Bauman, Richard, Human Rights in Ancient Rome (2002), pgs. 52-53 On one occasion, when he attended the theatre, Flamininus sat as far away as possible from the seats reserved for the senators. The people proceeded to loudly protest this indignity to a former consul, and they only quieted down when he agreed to move and take a seat among the senators of consular rank.Slater, William J., Roman Theater and Society: E.

Monument to the bishops and vicars Apostolic in front of the cathedral at Quilon-Tangasseri The Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon is the first Catholic diocese in India in the city of Kollam and under the Ecclesiastical Province of Trivandrum. The diocese, which covers an area of 1,950 km². (753 square miles), and contains a population of 4,879,553 - 235,922 (4.8%) of which are Catholic. It was first erected on 9 August 1329, and was re-erected on 1 September 1886. , Paul Antony Mullassery is the bishop of the Diocese of Quilon. History =Early history= According to tradition, St. Thomas the Apostle established seven churches along the southern part of west coast of India, and Quilon (pronounced Koy- lon) is the second in the list of the above seven churches. John of Monte Corvino, a member of the Societas Peregrinantium Pro Christo on his way to China, landed in Quilon in 1291 and ministered the Christian community. The Venetian traveller Marco Polo who visited India in 1292 testified to the presence of a Christian community in Quilon. =Erection of the diocese its first bishop= Since the latter half of the 13th century, Quilon became the chief centre of missionary expeditions. Franciscan and Dominican Missionaries in the 13th and 14th centuries visited Quilon and their letters confirm the existence of a vibrant Christian community in Quilon. In 1329 Pope John XXII, from the Holy See then in Avignon (France), erected Quilon as the first Diocese in the whole of Indies as suffragan to the Archdiocese of Sultany in Persia through the decree \\"Romanus Pontifex\\" dated 9 August 1329 By a separate bull, \\"Venerabili Fratri Jordano\\", the same Pope, on 21 August 1329 appointed the French or Catalan Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani as the first Bishop of Quilon. (Copies of the Orders and the related letters issued by Pope John XXII to Bishop Jordanus Catalani and to the diocese of Quilon are documented and preserved in the diocesan archives. Also reprinted in the Indian Church History Classics, Vol.I, The Nazranies, South Asia Research Assistance Services, Ed. Prof. George Menachery, Ollur, 1998.) The ancient diocese of Quilon had extensive jurisdiction over modern nations of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka. Jordanus Catalani arrived in Surat in 1320. After his ministry in Gujarat he reached Quilon in 1323. He not only revived Christianity but also brought hundreds to the Christian fold. He might have come again to Quilon as the bishop in 1330 to build the church at Quilon, known as St. George of the Latins. George happened to be the patron saint of the Catalans, besides being popular among other Christian communities on the Malabar coast. His book \\"Mirabilia Descripta\\" is a rare work on plants, animals and the people of India and of other countries in Asia and this is an authoritative work on India dating 700 years back. This book is considered to be a landmark chronicle of its time written around 1327. The first Latin Bishop of Quilon was received with great jubilation by the faithful of Quilon. He brought a message of good wishes from the Pope to the local rulers. As the first Latin bishop in India, he was also entrusted with the duty of spiritual nourishment of the Christian community in Calicut, Mangalore, Thane and Baruch (Gujarat). According to Portuguese sources, written more than two centuries later, he was martyred by Muslims in Bombay in 1336, as much as the four Franciscan friars that he had to bury, fifteen years before, in the very same place (one of them, Thomas of Tolentino, was beatified). In the year 1348 John De Marignoli, the Papal Legate to China on his way back to Rome sojourned here for 14 months. With the martyrdom of the first Latin Bishop, the See of Quilon remained vacant. There was a 'historic gap' with regard to ecclesiastical administration in India till the Portuguese landed here in 1498 AD. It follows from the Friar Jordanus tradition that Catholicism – not just Christianity – is deep rooted in Quilon. It is now settled that Latin Catholicism was brought to Kerala in the early 14th century by this Catalan or Occitan speaking Dominican. It is now evident that while Bishop Jordanus introduced Latin Catholicism, the Portuguese popularized it. In the 1340s, an Italian friar called Marignolli called on Kollam and still found a Catholic church that he mentions as Saint George of the Latins, probably built by Jordanus (Saint George was popular among the Malabar Syrian Christians, but also happens to be the Patron Saint of Catalonia). The fact that Quilon is the founding seat of the Catholic Church in India is often found obscured in the midst of history. =Franciscan missionary activity= John De Marignolli (Giovanni de' Marignolli) of St. Lorenzo in Florence, joined the Franciscan order and was consecrated bishop in 1338 AD. He was chosen as legate to China by Pope Benedict XII (1334–1342). He preached in China and on his way back from China, he landed at Quilon and lived there for over a year, preaching in St. George's Church, which was founded by Jordanus. In 1338 during the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XII (1334–1342) the great Khan of Peking in China sent a great delegation of ambassadors to the Pope at Avignon and were given a royal reception by the Pope. They requested the Pope to send a legate who would be wise, capable and virtuous to care for their souls. Responding to their request the Pope chose John De Marignolli as his legate to China and he accompanied the ambassadors of Great Khan on their homeward journey. Marignolli departed with a great number of friars and precious gifts for Khan, princes and sovereigns. They departed in March 1339 and after a long and perilous journey reached their destination, Khanbalique in 1342 and were received by the Great Khan, who was the last of the Mongol dynasty in China. After three years of mission Marignolli decided to return to Europe. On his departure on 26 December 1345 he set out for Quilon where he arrived on 23 March 1346. The Christians of Quilon warmly welcomed him. He lived there for over a year, and preached in St. George's Church, founded by Jordanus. He concentrated himself in the Latin Church of St. George founded by Bishop Jordanus. He preached in this Church and adorned the Church with paintings. He could not do much of missionary activity here since he became sick with dysentery during his stay at Quilon. When he recovered he visited Cape Comorin the extremity of Indian Peninsula where he erected a marble pillar mounted by a cross in full view of Ceylon. It seems that he was an ambitious man and was desirous that the good people of Quilon should never forget him and that was the intention of the erection of the marble pillar. The column, which was to endure till the world's end soon crumbled under the corroding influence of the elements and the inscriptions, were destroyed. Later a wrong tradition developed, attributing this column to St. Thomas. Marignolli set for Sumatra and Ceylon in July 1347. In September 1348 he came back to India. He left India in 1350 AD. =Portuguese control= The Portuguese missionaries made Quilon one of their most important centers of evangelization. St. Francis Xavier laboured here for several years. He established a Seminary in Quilon and his letters to Rome give testimony of a dynamic Christian community in Quilon. The history of Quilon Diocese from 16th century to 20th century was linked to the battle of European empires for the control of Malabar Coast. The Portuguese who arrived in Quilon in 1503 revived and strengthened the Christian community. They built several churches and monasteries and established new centers of Christianity. Quilon remained a territory under the Franciscans until 1533 AD when the Diocese of Goa was established and Quilon became part of the new Diocese. However, in the year 1557 AD, when Cochin was erected as a suffragan Diocese of the Archdiocese of Goa, Quilon became part of Cochin Diocese. The Portuguese tenure in Quilon has contributed much to its growth and development. Their primary concern was the abolition of the caste system. They made education available to all communities. They started presses, which were a set-up that made available books in cheaper cost, and thus people began to read and acquire knowledge. It is a little known fact that one of the oldest presses in India was established at Tangasseri. The press was attached to the San Salvador Seminary of the diocese established by a Jesuit Priest, Fr. Jao de Faria. The first book in Kerala \\"Doctrina Christa\\" was published from Quilon on 20 October 1578. The Harvard University library possesses a surviving copy of this book. It was printed in the neo-Tamil script of the time in Kerala. The one printed at Quilon, Doctrina Christs en Lingua Malabar Tamil is a translation of St. Francis Xavier's work in Portuguese, translated by Fr. Henrique and Father Manual de San Pedro. The second page of the book mentions that it was printed on 20 October 1578 at the press of the 'Saviour.' Till today that place of the press is known in Tangasseri (near the Bishop's House) as 'Achukuddom Parambu' (Press Place). =Suppression and reestablishment= In 1661 the Portuguese who tasted defeat from the Dutch, left Quilon. The Dutch who took control over Quilon, destroyed catholic churches and persecuted Catholics. The Christians of Quilon went through a dark period till 1741. The Dutch, defeated by Marthandavarma, the King of Travancore, had to leave Quilon. Yet another dark period for the Church in Quilon was in 1808 when Velu Thampi Dalava unleashed a fierce persecution on Christians. The Christian community of Quilon after remaining a long period without bishops became a part of the diocese of Goa in 1534, when Goa was made an Episcopal see, suffragan to Funchal in the Madeiras. When Goa was raised to an archbishopric on 4 February 1557, Cochin was made suffragan diocese to the Arch-diocese of Goa and Quilon became part of the Cochin diocese. Pope Gregory XVI created the Vicariate of Malabar by his bull Multa Praeclare of 24 April 1838 and suppressed the diocese of Cochin; and attached that territory along with Quilon to the Vicariate of Malabar (Verapoly). Later the Vicariate of Malabar was divided into three vicariates, Verapoly, Mangalore and Quilon by the Holy See on 12 May 1845. The apostolic vicariate of Quilon was extended from Arabian Sea to the 'Sahyan' Mountains and from Cape Comorin to Pamba River, which was provisionally entrusted to the Belgian discalced Carmelite missionaries. The separation of Quilon, as a new Vicariate Apostolic, suffragan to Verapoly was decreed and was provisionally executed on 12 May 1845, entrusting it to the Belgian Carmelite Missionaries, and finally confirmed as a separate Vicariate Apostolic on 15 March 1853. On 24 April 1838 the Holy See established the Vicariate of Malabar with headquarters at Verapoly and Quilon became part of the new vicariate. The separation of Quilon, as a new Vicariate Apostolic, suffragan to Verapoly was decreed and was provisionally executed on 12 May 1845, entrusting it to the Belgian Carmelite Missionaries, and finally confirmed as a separate Vicariate Apostolic on 15 March 1853. With the establishment of the Hierarchy in India, Quilon again became a Diocese on 1 September 1886 with jurisdiction over the territory from Cape Comerin to Pampa River, in the north. This arrangement was effected in 1853, and on the establishment of the hierarchy in 1886 it was finally elevated into an episcopal see, suffragan to Verapoly.

In 12 September 1730, a royal party led by Giridhar Bhandari, a minister of the maharajah of Marwar, arrived at the village with the intention of felling some Khejri trees that were sacred to the villagers. The trees were to be burned to produce lime for the construction of a new palace. A local woman called Amrita Devi Bishnoi protested against the tree-felling because such acts were prohibited by the Bishnoi's religion. The feudal party said that they would only cease if she paid them a bribe, which she refused to do because she saw that as ignominious and an insult to her faith. She said that she would rather give away her life to save the trees. She and her two daughters (Asu, Ratni and Bhagu) were then killed by the party. News of the deaths spread and summons to a meeting were sent to 84Bishnoi villages. The meeting determined that one Bishnoi volunteer would sacrifice their life for every tree that was cut down. Older people began hugging the trees that were intended to be cut and many were killed. These efforts failed to have the desired impact and Bhandari claimed that the Bishnois were sacrificing ageing people whom they no longer saw as useful to society. In response to this, young men, women and children began to follow the example of the old. The development shocked the tree-felling party. The group left for Jodhpur with their mission unfulfilled and the Maharaja Abhai Singh of Marwar subsequently ordered that no more trees should be felled. 363 Bishnois died in the incident.

In contrast to the piezoelectric effect, the piezoresistive effect causes a change only in electrical resistance, not in electric potential.  History  The change of electrical resistance in metal devices due to an applied mechanical load was first discovered in 1856 by Lord Kelvin. With single crystal silicon becoming the material of choice for the design of analog and digital circuits, the large piezoresistive effect in silicon and germanium was first discovered in 1954 (Smith 1954).  Mechanism  In conducting and semi-conducting materials, changes in inter-atomic spacing resulting from strain affect the bandgaps, making it easier (or harder depending on the material and strain) for electrons to be raised into the conduction band. This results in a change in resistivity of the material. Within a certain range of strain this relationship is linear, so that the piezoresistive coefficient : rho_sigma = frac{left(frac{partialrho}{rho}right)}{varepsilon} where :∂ρ = Change in resistivity :ρ = Original resistivity :ε = Strain is constant. = Piezoresistivity in metals = Usually the resistance change in metals is mostly due to the change of geometry resulting from applied mechanical stress. However, even though the piezoresistive effect is small in those cases it is often not negligible. In cases where it is, it can be calculated using the simple resistance equation derived from Ohm's law; :R = rhofrac{ell}{A} , where :ell Conductor length [m] :A Cross-sectional area of the current flow [m²] Some metals display piezoresistivity that is much larger than the resistance change due to geometry. In platinum alloys, for instance, piezoresistivity is more than a factor of two larger, combining with the geometry effects to give a strain gauge sensitivity of up to more than three times as large than due to geometry effects alone. Pure nickel's piezoresistivity is -13 times larger, completely dwarfing and even reversing the sign of the geometry-induced resistance change. = Piezoresistive effect in bulk semiconductors = The piezoresistive effect of semiconductor materials can be several orders of magnitudes larger than the geometrical effect and is present in materials like germanium, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon carbide, and single crystal silicon. Hence, semiconductor strain gauges with a very high coefficient of sensitivity can be built. For precision measurements they are more difficult to handle than metal strain gauges, because semiconductor strain gauges are generally sensitive to environmental conditions (esp. temperature). For silicon, gauge factors can be two orders of magnitudes larger than those observed in most metals (Smith 1954). The resistance of n-conducting silicon mainly changes due to a shift of the three different conducting valley pairs. The shifting causes a redistribution of the carriers between valleys with different mobilities. This results in varying mobilities dependent on the direction of current flow. A minor effect is due to the effective mass change related to changing shapes of the valleys. In p-conducting silicon the phenomena are more complex and also result in mass changes and hole transfer. = Giant piezoresistance in metal- silicon hybrid structures = A giant piezoresistive effect – where the piezoresistive coefficient exceeds the bulk value – was reported for a microfabricated silicon-aluminium hybrid structure.A.

Since silicon is today the material of choice for integrated digital and analog circuits the use of piezoresistive silicon devices has been of great interest. It enables the easy integration of stress sensors with Bipolar and CMOS circuits. This has enabled a wide range of products using the piezoresistive effect. Many commercial devices such as pressure sensors and acceleration sensors employ the piezoresistive effect in silicon. But due to its magnitude the piezoresistive effect in silicon has also attracted the attention of research and development for all other devices using single crystal silicon. Semiconductor Hall sensors, for example, were capable of achieving their current precision only after employing methods which eliminate signal contributions due to applied mechanical stress. = Piezoresistors = Piezoresistors are resistors made from a piezoresistive material and are usually used for measurement of mechanical stress. They are the simplest form of piezoresistive devices.  Fabrication  Piezoresistors can be fabricated using wide variety of piezoresistive materials. The simplest form of piezoresistive silicon sensors are diffused resistors. Piezoresistors consist of a simple two contact diffused n- or p-wells within a p- or n-substrate. As the typical square resistances of these devices are in the range of several hundred ohms, additional p+ or n+ plus diffusions are a potential method to facilitate ohmic contacts to the device. Image:Piezoresistor.jpg Schematic cross-section of the basic elements of a silicon n-well piezoresistor.  Physics of operation  For typical stress values in the MPa range the stress dependent voltage drop along the resistor Vr, can be considered to be linear. A piezoresistor aligned with the x-axis as shown in the figure may be described by : V_r = R_0 I[1 + pi _L sigma _{xx} + pi _T (sigma _{yy} + sigma _{zz} )] where R_0, I, pi _T, pi _L, and sigma _{ij} denote the stress free resistance, the applied current, the transverse and longitudinal piezoresistive coefficients, and the three tensile stress components, respectively. The piezoresistive coefficients vary significantly with the sensor orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes and with the doping profile. Despite the fairly large stress sensitivity of simple resistors, they are preferably used in more complex configurations eliminating certain cross sensitivities and drawbacks. Piezoresistors have the disadvantage of being highly sensitive to temperature changes while featuring comparatively small relative stress dependent signal amplitude changes. = Other piezoresistive devices = In silicon the piezoresistive effect is used in piezoresistors, transducers, piezo-FETS, solid state accelerometers and bipolar transistors.

Pulpit Rock is a coastal feature at Portland Bill, the southern tip of the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. Representing an open bible leaning on a pulpit, Pulpit Rock was formed in the 1870s after a natural arch was cut away by quarrymen at Bill Quarry. As a quarrying relic, the rock is similar to that of Nicodemus Knob, another quarrying landmark on the island. Pulpit Rock has become a popular tourist attraction on the island and is often photographed. Despite the danger, for many decades it has been a popular place for tombstoning. Pulpit Rock is also a popular point for wrasse anglers. The British record Ballan wrasse was caught there in 1998 by Pete Hegg. The geological succession up from sea level is: Portland Cherty Series (up to the level of the neighbouring quarried platform), then Portland Freestone (the oolitic limestone quarried inland of Pulpit Rock), then a cap of thin-bedded limestones which are part of the basal Purbeck Formation.

Kneeing is a disallowed practice in many combat sports, especially to the head of a downed opponent. Styles such as Muay Thai and several mixed martial arts organizations allow kneeing depending on the positioning of the fighters.  Straight  The straight knee (also known as a front knee) is a typical knee strike, and involves thrusting the front of the knee into the head or body of an opponent. The straight knee can be applied from a stand-up position both when the combatants are separated, or when they are clinching. A particularly effective clinching position for throwing front knee is the double collar tie, where the head of the opponent is controlled. On the ground, front knees can be effective from a few top positions such as the Side control and north-south position. Typical targets for the front knee include the head, hips, ribs, solar plexus, stomach and thighs. In Muay Thai, a double collar tie with a front knee to the face was traditionally called Hak Kor Aiyara. The groin is widely considered the key target for knee strikes and clinch knee attacks in a street fight according to karate, tae kwon do, muay thai, and many other martial arts.  Curved  The curved knee (also sometimes called a side knee or roundhouse knee) is similar to the front knee except that it does not use a forward thrusting motion, but is instead rotated from the outside. Whereas the front knee needs some space in between the combatants to be performed, the curved knee can be executed from a minimal distance, such as in a close clinch. This technique is often employed when an opponent is attempting to protect from a straight knee. Typical targets include floating ribs, hips, and the side of the abdomen.  Flying  180 px A flying knee (known as hanuman thayarn in Muay Thai, and sometimes called a jumping knee) is a knee strike very similar to a front knee, except that it is performed in stand-up fighting by jumping, and often by rushing towards the opponent. A more reckless application of the flying knee strike can be applied by rotating the body so that the side of the knee strikes the opponent, used more as an offensive pushing attack rather than a concussive KO attack. Generally, flying knee strikes can be effectively applied when the opponent is off-balanced, recovering from previous strikes, or as a counter to a strike by the opponent. It can also be used as a follow-up maneuver after delivering a particularly incapacitating strike. One example took place at a UFC event, where Jorge Masvidal knocked Ben Askren unconscious in 5 seconds with a flying knee when Askren shot in for a takedown. A famous flying knee strike in pop culture is the \\"Knee of Justice\\" used by Captain Falcon in the Super Smash Bros. series. = Use in combat sports = Provided that it makes impact with the head, a flying knee offers substantial momentum and knockout power. This spectacular strike is a crowd-pleaser in fighting sports such as K-1 (kickboxing) and MMA. In one UFC bout, James Irvin knocked out Terry Martin with a flying knee; Martin was unresponsive for three minutes and left on a stretcher.Gross, Josh.

Japanese professional wrestling, in keeping with its martial arts roots, has many wrestlers utilizing knees in matches. Tomomi Tsuruta also used a jumping knee as one of his finishing moves. Takashi Sugiura and Jun Akiyama are known for their effective knee strikes. José Aldo landed a double flying knee at WEC 41 against Cub Swanson, in one of his first international MMA fights, scoring a knockout win just eight seconds into the first round of the fight.

First Affirmative Constructive (1AC) :a. Cross-examination of First Affirmative by Second Negative 2. First Negative Constructive (1NC) :a. Cross-examination of First Negative by First Affirmative 3. Second Affirmative Constructive (2AC) :a. Cross-examination of Second Affirmative by First Negative 4. Second Negative Constructive (2NC) :a. Cross-examination of Second Negative by Second Affirmative 5. First Negative Rebuttal (1NR) 6. First Affirmative Rebuttal (1AR) 7. Second Negative Rebuttal (2NR) 8. Second Affirmative Rebuttal (2AR) In high school, all four constructive speeches are generally eight minutes long and all four rebuttal speeches are four or five minutes in length depending on the region; in college they are nine and six minutes long respectively. All cross-examination periods are three minutes long in high school and in college. History Traditionally, rebuttals were half the length of constructive speeches, 8–4 min in high school and 10–5 min in college. The now-prevailing speech time of 8–5 min in high school and 9-5 in college was introduced in the 1990s. Some states, such as Missouri, Massachusetts and Colorado, still use the 8–4 min format at the high school level. 1AC The First Affirmative Constructive (1AC) is the first speech given in a round, presented by the affirmative team. jpo solvency, as well as a plan text, the textual expression of the affirmative policy optihl 1NC The First Negative Constructive (1NC) is the first speech given by the negative team and the second speech in the round. It is given by the first negative speaker. The 1NC will generally present all of the major arguments which the negative plans to present in the round. Off-case arguments made include topicality, disadvantages, counter plans, and kritiks. The negative generally also goes on case, contesting the advantage scenarios presented by the affirmative in the 1AC, also often contesting solvency and/or inherency. 2AC The Second Affirmative Constructive (2AC) is the second speech given by the affirmative team, the third speech in the round, given by the second affirmative speaker. The 2AC must answer all of the arguments read in the 1NC. If there is time remaining, the 2AC sometimes also includes add-ons, or additional advantage scenarios. If negative arguments are not addressed, they are considered conceded. 2NC The Second Negative Constructive (2NC) is the second speech given by the negative team, the fourth speech in the round, given by the second negative speaker. It is the first part of the negative block and thus will only cover part of the 2AC. Often the 2NC will bring up new arguments, to require the 1AR to cover more arguments in their 5 minutes (6 minutes in college). However, some judges consider it abusive to add new off-case arguments, as the affirmative only has five minutes to respond. It is not inappropriate to ask the judge's view on allowing new arguments in the 2NC; after all it is a constructive speech. 1NR The First Negative Rebuttal (1NR) is the third speech given by the negative team, the fifth speech in the round, given by the first negative speaker. Because it is the second part of the negative block, it usually takes arguments not covered by the 2NC. The 1NR can also take arguments which the 2NC did not finish answering or which the 2NC realizes that it accidentally dropped during the cross-examination. The 1NR undoubtedly has the most preparation time of any speech given in the debate. It can often start prepping during the 2AC, and always has whatever prep time is taken for the 2NC, the 2NC, and the cross- examination of the 2NC to prepare (after cross-examining the 2AC). This amounts to a minimum of 11 minutes in high school and 12 minutes in college even if no preparation time is taken for the 2NC (rare). Theoretically, the 1NR could spend a few minutes preparing and then give the speech (subvocally) twice before having to speak. As a result, the 1NR will often answer the 2AC arguments which are more preparation intensive (arguments to which the negative does not already have prescripted blocks). Although the 1N is the first speaker to be done with speeches in the round, a good 1N will continue to flow the rest of the speeches to protect the 2NR and retain a more accurate flow to have more information for future rounds. 1AR The First Affirmative Rebuttal (1AR) is the first rebuttal speech given by the affirmative, the sixth speech in the round. The 1AR must respond to the entirety of the negative block. The ratio of negative block time to 1AR time is 5:00 in high school and 5:2 in college. A 1AR may make strategic concessions or undercover certain positions to gain a time trade off to compensate for this apparent inequity. The 1AR is also in many ways a shadow speech for the 2AR and the community consensus between what constitutes shadow coverage and what leaves legitimate room for 2AR extrapolation is still contested. Almost all judges will allow the 1AR to read new pieces of evidence and make new arguments, especially in response to new arguments during the negative block. 2NR The Second Negative Rebuttal (2NR) is the fourth and last speech given by the negative team. It is the seventh speech in the debate, given by the second negative speaker. The 2NR will often take the remainder of the negative's preparation time. The 2NR will usually only go for some of the arguments presented in the 1NC although community norms prevent it for going for 1NC arguments which were not extended in the negative block. Especially in rounds with experienced debaters, the 2NR will usually try to win the round with as few arguments as possible enabling it to effectively cover all relevant 1AR arguments while gaining a substantial time trade off. However, sometimes the 2NR will go for multiple positions, allowing it to win the round in multiple worlds, if it believes it can effectively pressure the 2AR. This is risky because the 2AR, in that situation, will most likely go for the arguments which the 2NR covered the least. The 2NR also has to \\"close doors\\" for the 2AR by predicting the areas in which the 2AR will attempt new extrapolation. The 2NR can caution the judge to reject new 2AR arguments but this is less effective than preempting such arguments with \\"even if\\" statements. 2AR The Second Affirmative Rebuttal (2AR) is the second rebuttal speech given by the affirmative, and the eighth and final speech in the round. The 2AR generally only answers the arguments made by the 2NR, going to other flows only when the affirmative believes the negative has made a strategic blunder on that piece of paper. In general, the 2AR may not make new arguments that were not in the 1AR. However, because the negative does not go for arguments that the 1AR had to answer, the 2AR is almost always bigger than the portion of the 1AR it represents. Some arguments are never new, like certain forms of extrapolation from 1AR arguments and impact calculus (although many judges prefer it earlier in the round). The 2AR will almost never present new pieces of evidence but often will refer to pieces of evidence read earlier in the round by their citation, especially if the affirmative wants the judge to read that piece of evidence after the round. Cross-Examination Periods Following each constructive speech, there is a three-minute cross-examination period in which the opposing team questions the team which just spoke. Usually, the cross-examination is conducted by the opponent who will not speak next of the speaker who just spoke, but some cross-examinations are open, that is: either partner may ask or answer questions. However, it is often frowned upon when a partner who is not the previous speaker answers cross-examination questions Preparation Time In addition to speeches, policy debates may allow for a certain amount of preparation time, or \\"prep time\\", during a debate round. NSDA rules call for five minutes of total prep time that can be used, although in practice high school debate tournaments often give eight minutes of prep time. College debates typically have 10 minutes of preparation time. The preparation time is used at each team's preference; they can use different amounts of preparation time before any of their speeches, or even none at all. Alternative Use Time Some tournaments have neither cross- examination time nor preparation time. Rather, each team is given 16 minutes of alternative use time. Alternative use time can always be used as prep time but after a constructive speech it also doubles as cross-examination time. Thus, if the 2AC needs six minutes to get ready after the 1NC, the first affirmative speaker would get to cross-examine the first negative speaker for those six minutes while the second affirmative speaker is preparing. Alternative use time may not be used for cross-examination after rebuttal speeches. References *Seeland, Lisa. (2000). Practical Refutation and an Effective First Affirmative Rebuttal. Rostrum.

The majority of profiles are sexually explicit and include nude photographs and graphic language and are by patrons that are looking to hook up. Some profiles, however, are specifically not designated as primarily sexually-oriented and explicitly state they are not cruising for sex. History Manhunt was officially launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts on April 1, 2001 by Jonathan Crutchley and Larry Basile after their original Boston-based gay telephone dating service declined when more of their clients began to use the Web to find partners. Within a year, about 10,000 men from the greater Boston area had created profiles on the site. Initially a free service, Manhunt emailed its customers in April 2002 and told them that those who wanted to enjoy all the perks of the site would have to pay $10 per month, and those who declined to pay would be able to use a more bare-bones version of the site. About 2,000 customers immediately signed up for the paid membership. In December 2006, an independent tracking agency ranked Manhunt as the largest LGBT-targeted site online, surpassing long-time leader Gay.com. In April 2008, Crutchley revealed to Bay Windows that Manhunt has more subscribers outside the U.S. than in the U.S. In mid-2008, Manhunt made video chat available to members after popular request. In August 2008, Manhunt launched OnTheHUNT, a companion video-hosting site dedicated to filming actual Manhunt members having sex. To distinguish itself from competitors, OnTheHUNT boasted unlimited video lengths and used its own members as models instead of gay-for-pay actors. In early 2009, Manhunt released its first major upgrade in 7 years. The upgrade modernized the site's look and feel and included many sought-after features, like the addition of penis size and sex position preferences to members' profiles. On November 13, 2013, Manhunt announced—via its corporate moniker Online Buddies, Inc.—the acquisition of Jack'd, one of the leading location-based gay dating apps. Jack'd had over 2 million active accounts and about 1 million daily unique users when the acquisition deal was signed. Manhunt plans to keep Jack'd a separate product from Manhunt. Public health Manhunt partners with hundreds of community health organizations worldwide under its \\"Manhunt Cares\\" initiative. Using approved health profiles, community health partners run ads alongside members' personal postings. Many of these are partner notification profiles that serve as anonymous intermediaries that allow members to inform each other when they may have come in contact with an STD. In August 2006, a community health advocate at the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts told the Boston Herald, \\"In comparison to lots of other sites, [Manhunt]'s light- years ahead.\\" Nevertheless, Manhunt still provides a chat room titled \\"Bareback\\" for its members interested in unsafe sex. It also features advertising from porn websites that promote bareback sex, and it promotes bareback porn via its Manhunt Blog. In May 2005, Manhunt's general manager told New York Magazine: > It all boils down to personal choice. We believe that people have the right > to PNP or not to PNP, to use condoms or not use condoms. What we hope is > that people will back up their choices with responsible behavior. We > provided an empty site and our customers have filled it. But the majority of > them don't PNP or bareback. Controversies In December 2005, a Richmond, Virginia school board chairman resigned after his \\"explicit\\" Manhunt profile was discovered by a Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter. At a public school board meeting, the chairman told the crowd he \\"displayed an inappropriate lack of judgment.\\" In November 2005 and April 2006, police in Washington, D.C. made two arrests for theft crimes related to victims they had met on Manhunt. In August 2008, Manhunt's co-founder Jonathan Crutchley resigned from the company's board after it was revealed that he made a $2,300 contribution to John McCain's presidential campaign in March 2008. In February 2009, Crutchley was appointed Chairman of Manhunt's Philanthropy Committee.

The citation contains all relevant reference information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically cited in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The body is a section or portion of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly--cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tagline, the debater's summary of the evidence, is read first, followed by the body and citation. As pieces of evidence accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often accrue, sometimes making it difficult to discern which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters begin and end outside of the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to \\"mark\\" the card to show where one has done the reading during a speech. For that reason, highlighting or underlying once only throughout a year's worth of active debating in tournaments is much preferred practice over re-clipping over the same cards. To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read--either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections--is known as \\"cross- reading\\" or \\"clipping cards\\", which is generally considered extra-debating the source cited rather than debating one's interlocutor. Although many judges overtly disfavor the practice, it is easy to enforce, especially if judges endeavor to coach less experienced debaters. As cards are read in a round, it is uncommon for an opponent to collect and examine the cards while a debater is speaking. This uncommon practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate much faster than conversational speed but also because the non- underlined portion of cards is not read in-round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. before cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence are shared after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced. After a round, judges often \\"call for cards\\" to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves. Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably National Catholic Forensic League nationals, and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes \\"doing work for debaters that should have been done during the round\\". Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school. Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of citation references for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published online. Many teams may use other media to present \\"evidence\\" such as music, pictures, poetry, dance, etc. Using other media to present evidence is considered a performance argument and the team may defend or claim advantages from the presentation itself and not only the substance.

It is the third and final sequel to that company's The Mummy's Hand of 1940. The film is the sequel to The Mummy's Ghost (1944). The film is the fifth entry in Universal Pictures' original Mummy franchise. It marks Lon Chaney, Jr.'s final appearance as Kharis, the Egyptian mummy. The action of this film, which continues the story of Kharis and his beloved Princess Ananka, is supposed to take place in the same swampy location that was the setting of The Mummy's Ghost. But while the earlier movie was explicitly set in rural Massachusetts, this film strongly implies that the swamp is in Louisiana, with references to Cajuns and bayous. Furthermore, if one follows the continuity of the \\"Kharis\\" series, this film would have to take place in the late 1990s.  Plot  The Southern Engineering Company is trying to drain the local swamp for the public good. However, the efforts are being hampered by the superstitions of the workers, who believe the area to be haunted by the mummy and his bride. Two representatives of the Scripps Museum, Dr. James Halsey (Dennis Moore) and Dr. Ilzor Zandaab (Peter Coe), arrive on the scene and present their credentials to the head of the project, Pat Walsh (Addison Richards). They have come to search for the missing mummies, buried in the swamp years earlier. Their conversation is interrupted by the news that a workman has been murdered in the swamps. Evidence at the scene convinces Halsey that the murderer has found the mummy of Kharis. Later that evening, Zandaab sneaks into the swamp and meets Ragheb (Martin Kosleck). Ragheb is a disciple of the Arkam sect, and Zandaab is secretly a High Priest. The follower killed the worker that unearthed Kharis, and has taken the immobile monster to a deserted monastery. Zandaab explains the legend of Kharis and Ananka to Ragheb as he brews the tana leaves, giving instructions on their use. The old sacristan of the monastery (William Farnum) intrudes on their ritual, and is promptly executed by a risen Kharis. Meanwhile, the mummy of Ananka (Virginia Christine) rises from the swamp after being partially uncovered by a bulldozer during the excavation. She immerses herself in a pond and the mud is washed away, revealing an attractive young woman. Cajun Joe (Kurt Katch) finds the girl wandering listlessly in the swamps, calling out the name \\"Kharis\\". He takes her to Tante Berthe (Ann Codee), the owner of the local pub, who aids the girl. Later, Kharis finds her there and murders Berthe, as Ananka flees into the night. Ananka is soon found lying unconscious beside the road by Halsey and Betty Walsh (Kay Harding), the niece of Pat Walsh. While in their care, and although apparently suffering from amnesia, the girl displays an incredible knowledge of ancient Egypt. Her stay at Halsey's camp is again interrupted by the appearance of Kharis, and the kindly physician, Dr. Cooper (Holmes Herbert), is killed. She again takes flight, and Halsey and the others go in search of her. Fleeing the monster after he attacks and kills Cajun Joe, she comes to Betty's tent seeking refuge. However, Kharis is not far behind. He enters the tent and whisks away his Princess, leaving the horrified Betty unhurt. Betty asks Ragheb for his help in finding Dr. Halsey. The treacherous disciple has other ideas, and takes her to the monastery instead. Zandaab, having already administered the tana fluid to the young Ananka, is angered to find Ragheb making advances on Betty. He orders her death, but Ragheb kills him instead. Halsey arrives, tracking them from the camp after finding Betty's tent destroyed. A struggle ensues between Ragheb and Halsey, until Kharis intervenes. The creature, sensing Ragheb's betrayal, advances on his former ally. Locking himself inside a cell-like room, Ragheb is powerless to do anything but watch as Kharis literally brings down the walls on the two of them. Halsey, Betty and the rest find the mummified remains of Ananka in the adjoining room.

High School Tournaments Most high school debaters debate in local tournaments in their city, state or nearby states. Hundreds of such tournaments are held at high schools throughout the US each weekend during the debate season. =Structure= Tournaments at the high school level often include individual, or speech events, in addition to debate. Many debaters choose to compete in both speech and debate events. These events vary based on the tournament and its sponsoring agency. A typical tournament is spread over two days, and usually occurs on the weekend (Friday-Saturday) Day one is usually reserved for speech events and preliminary debate rounds. The number of preliminary rounds varies from tournament to tournament, ranging from only three rounds up to eight at the largest of tournaments. The preliminaries of speech are often concluded during this time. In some cases the events alternate with one round of speech, then one round of debate and so on. Day two is usually reserved with the \\"out-rounds\\" of the tournament, in which those that qualified (based on pre-elimination records) will compete in elimination rounds. =Breaking into Out-Rounds= Also known as \\"clearing\\", debaters are scored based upon win-loss record, speaking ability, and the win- loss record of the teams they opposed. To first decide who qualifies, win-loss record is used, then moving down the list to break ties. The winners are seeded into a bracket that is either \\"power-protected\\" or \\"power-matched\\". For example, in a power-protect tournament, the highest seed will debate the lowest seed, and in a power-matched tournament, the high seed will debate the high seed. At most tournaments the out-rounds will start at the octo-final level, although at large tournaments out-rounds may begin at the double or even triple octo-final level and some very small local tournaments could break to Quarterfinals, or in extremely small tournaments Semifinals. These rounds are commonly adjudicated with a panel of three or more judges. The siding of the debate is often based on a coin flip, unless the two opposing teams had debated one another earlier in the tournament. =Sweepstakes= Each school will fill an entry with speakers and debaters to qualify for the sweepstakes award, in which the collective achievements of the teams are compared to decide which school will win that tournament. Points are awarded for debaters and speakers who break into out-rounds, with the higher points awarded for finalists. During the tabulation of the tournament, a winner is decided and awarded during the Awards Ceremony at the conclusion of the tournament. =National Circuit= A small subset of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments in what is called the 'national circuit.' Major national circuit tournaments include the Glenbrooks at Glenbrook North and Glenbrook South High Schools in the North Shore area of Chicago, the Barkley Forum for High Schools at Emory University, the Greenhill Fall Classic at Greenhill in Texas, the Berkeley Invitational at Berkeley in Northern California, and the St. Mark's Heart of Texas Invitational at St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas, however there are seven major tournaments and about forty smaller national circuit tournaments. Colleges and university with policy debate programs at the collegiate level also often host tournaments for this circuit. Another elite form is the TOC (Tournament of Champions), in which qualification is required by winning bids from at least two large-scale, participating tournaments by advancing to a certain stage depending on the size of the tournament. About 70 teams of two from around the country qualify for the TOC every year. =High School Championship= *The high school debate tournament generally considered to be the national circuit championship is the Tournament of Champions held at the University of Kentucky. *For non-national circuit debaters the national championship is generally considered to be the national tournament of their sponsoring organization, either ** the National Urban Debate Championship Tournament of the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues **the National Speech and Debate Tournament of the National Forensic League or **the Grand National Tournament of the National Catholic Forensic League or the NCFCA. *The largest high school debate tournament by entry is the Glenbrooks. *Students in urban debate programs participate in tournaments sponsored by local urban debate leagues or by the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues, which annually hosts a national championship in Chicago. *The National Debate Coaches' Association hosts an annual tournament at the end of the year, with a qualification process based on points achieved at various tournaments. This tournament is generally viewed as a precursor national tournament to the TOC, because the same teams generally qualify to both tournaments. College Tournaments Inter-Collegiate policy debate has a scheduled list of tournaments through the season at both a regional and national scale. The season spans from September to the end of March and at times into the beginning of April. Colleges and universities host tournaments most weekends during this span of time. =Structure= Tournaments are hosted over a three-day period of time, in most instances. This can either be Friday- Sunday, or more often Saturday-Monday. The number of rounds per tournament ranges from 6-8 usually, although small regional tournaments may have fewer. The first two days of competition are when the preliminary rounds occur, possibly beginning the first out-round the second night. The final day of competition is reserved for out-rounds. =Breaking into Out-Rounds= The same system is used for determining who participates in elimination rounds at the college level, as at the high school level. It is common for tournaments to break to double octa-finals. The deliberation time for the judges in these elimination rounds is often lengthy, hence the need for a full day for the elimination rounds to be completed. =College National Championships= There is no single unified national championship in college debate; the National Debate Tournament (NDT), the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) and the American Debate Association (ADA) all host national tournaments. There are also Junior Varsity and Novice national championship tournaments, as well as a national title for community colleges. The NDT is one of the most prestigious college tournaments. CSTV a college sports network makes a documentary of the NDTs every year and showcases the top teams and some of the highlights from the tournament.

It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 March 2007. The centre has 16 outdoor courts, covering all the Grand Slam surfaces, six indoor courts, a gymnasium and sports science and medical facilities. It also houses the administration of the LTA, which was previously based at the Queen's Club in West Kensington. The National Tennis Centre was built in response to a 1999 review by the LTA of the reasons for its sustained failure to produce world class tennis players (the only British players of either sex to make the world top fifty in the 1990s were Tim Henman, who did not come up through the LTA system, and Greg Rusedski, who learned to play in Canada). It was inspired by the national tennis centres in the more successful tennis nations of France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and the United States and serves as a focus for high performance players and coaches. Previously the LTA's elite training facilities were at Queen's Club, but they were deemed inadequate for the purpose and Queen's is better known as a social club for wealthy Londoners rather than as a centre of sporting excellence. The LTA sold Queen's Club back to the club members. The south-west London location was chosen because it is close to the All England Club, home of the Wimbledon Championships, and many leading British players live in the area. The National Tennis Centre was designed by Hopkins Architects, the designers of Portcullis House. The Sport Canopy won a British Construction Industry Awards in 2011. The Centre has been criticised for not producing world class tennis players and financial waste. The centre closed in September 2014. Under the new model overseen by the LTA's chief executive, Michael Downey, the NTC was to remain the administrative headquarters of the organisation, but the elite players were only to use the 22 courts for occasional training camps.

It was the recipient of the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 1973 Tony Award for Best Play. Plot synopsis The setting is 1972 at the Coach's home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. On the twentieth anniversary of their victory in the Pennsylvania state championship game, four members of the starting lineup of a Catholic high school basketball team have gathered to celebrate. This reunion may be their last chance to reminisce with each other, due to Coach's illness. The fifth member of the starting lineup, Martin (who made the game-winning shot), has refused to attend the reunion. He bears a grudge against the Coach for reasons that do not become clear until late in the play. George Sitkowski has become Scranton's mayor, but he has proven inept and unpopular, and he is likely to lose his re-election bid. The fact that his challenger is Jewish is particularly galling to him. Phil Romano has become a millionaire in the strip-mining business, using his close ties to Mayor Sitkowski to obtain mining permits. Though Romano helps George financially, he is carrying on an affair with George's wife. James Daley is a local junior high school principal; his brother Tom is an unsuccessful, embittered, cynical alcoholic and ne'er-do-well writer. None of the men's lives have turned out as any of them had hoped; on some level, all still look to the Coach for guidance. The Coach has always been the embodiment of old-school Catholicism (Senator Joseph McCarthy and Father Charles Coughlin are heroes of his). He was also the one person in their lives who's sure of everything, and his absolute certainty and confidence gave them a sense of security. While the Coach thought he was teaching his players how to be men, they instead became emotional adolescents who still need him to tell them how to live their lives. But the Coach's pep talks, which had always inspired them, are beginning to sound hollow. Only now do they realize that the Coach was a bigot, a bully, and a bit of a fraud.

Highlights of the production were released on February 25, 2011.First Look at THAT CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON on Broadway! The revival met with a lukewarm reception from the critics. Reception At the time of its premiere, That Championship Season was a critical success. Those who liked the play complimented its humor, dialogue, and characters. Reviewing the Broadway production, Clive Barnes of the New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Miller has a perfect ear and instinct for the rough and tumble profanity of locker-room humor. The coarsely elegant gibes go along with Mr. Miller’s indictment of a society, which opens with an ironic playing of the National Anthem and then lacerates the sickness of small-town America full of bigotry, double-dealing, racism and hate.\\" Film adaptations Miller wrote and directed the film adaptation of the play that was released in 1982. Robert Mitchum starred as the Coach, replacing William Holden, who had died before filming began. Bruce Dern, Stacy Keach, Martin Sheen, and Paul Sorvino completed the cast. In 1999, Miller wrote another screenplay for television that was directed by Paul Sorvino, who also played the Coach. This version also starred Vincent D'Onofrio, Terry Kinney, Tony Shalhoub, and Gary Sinise, and the latter was a co-producer.

Stock issues are sometime referred to as on-case arguments or simply on-case or case arguments as opposed off-case arguments. Logicality Three issues must first be present in the affirmative case and are the main ideas or values to vote on for taking any action (in policy debate or in everyday life). They ask: What are we doing now (inherency stock issue)? What could we be doing differently (solvency stock issue)? What are the results of what we are doing now versus what we could be doing (significance stock issue)? The last stock issue, topicality, is procedural and unique to debate as it concerns how germane the plan (specifically, plan as stated) is to the given resolution. Components The stock issues are: *Significance: This answers the \\"why\\" of debate. All advantages and disadvantages to the status quo (resulting from inherency) and of the plan (resulting from solvency) are evaluated under significance. A common equivocation is to confuse \\"significance\\" with the word \\"significantly\\" that appears in many resolutions. Significance is derived from judicious weighing between advantages and disadvantages, whereas significant policy changes are judged by how much the policy itself changed independently of how good or bad the effects or Solvency are. Policy debate does not assume determinism, but every effect or consequence has to be argued with evidence that those effects or consequences can or do occur. *Harms: Harms are a way of elucidating the problems or shortcomings of the status quo. Since they prove the \\"so, no\\" of continuing with the status quo, harms are closely related to, but not the same as, Significance. *Inherency: The actual situation and causes of the status quo. A case is \\"not inherent\\" when the status quo is already implementing the plan or solving the harms. Clearly, a solution that is new or different from the status quo is not warranted in such a case. Three common types of inherency are: :*Structural inherency: Laws or other barriers to the implementation of the plan or causes of harms :*Attitudinal inherency: Beliefs or attitudes which prevent the implementation of the plan or causing harms :*Existential inherency: The harms exist and res ipsa loquitur, the status quo must not be able to solve the problem. It just is. *Topicality: The Affirmative case must affirm the resolution, since that is the job of the Affirmative in a debate round. The Affirmative case often is shown to be within the bounds of the resolution as defined by appropriate definitions, or functional implementation or resolution instrumentality through the Affirmative plan. When the resolution seems vague, the most likely or best likely intent, and even the deeper beneficial meaning of the resolution, is often considered and upheld. In practice, most debate strategies and debate club practice regions do not consider Topicality to be a \\"stock issue\\" per se; instead, it is a high-level debate brought up by the Negative that does not excuse the Affirmative plan or case approach from defects that are not found prima facie in the resolution. A straightforward Topicality in-round debate is different from a counter- resolution brought up by the Negative, different from a Negative counterplan, and different from the rare Affirmative counterplan. Topicality is an intrinsic, unstated Affirmative burden in the Affirmative's first speech. A Negative counterplan does not have to be topical, or it can be even more topical and more supportive of the resolution than the Affirmative's plan. There are no constraints on Negative counter-resolutions that aim to have better Solvency than the Affirmative if both sides agree on the status quo harms; any constraints would have to be debated. *Solvency: The advantages of the plan itself are presented in Solvency. Who or what does the plan benefit, and why is that good or valuable? Here the harms are often demonstrated to be solved by the plan, or the link to new advantages are shown. Without solvency, a plan is useless. Thus, the Affirmative almost always loses a debate without Solvency, no matter how well the debate speech described problems of the status quo. Depending on the allowance by judges to the cleverness of debate arguments, not all Affirmative strategies need to present a policy plan. They can, as the Affirmative case, affirm the resolution as a policy at the doctrinal, protocol, constitutional, treaty, or such supportive level and present partial plans, typically parts of the status quo, merely as examples. These types of Affirmative presentations are sometimes referred to as \\"d'accord with the resolution\\" or \\"agreement with the resolution\\" without specifying any particular plan to pursue. The affirmative case without a plan asks that the Negative plan must deter better the status quo harms or be better than the obvious Significance and Solvency already provided by the resolution. In that way, ratification of the resolution has binding effects, once affirmed, that scopes the feasibility of and judgment on the value of specific plans. For example, if the Federal government is already solving the problem, then plans that want to reach horizontal or reciprocal federalism solvency at the interstate level are considered redundant. *Justification: Do the case and the plan justify the resolution? This issue usually hinges on whether the topic at hand is one that the United States Federal Government should be involved in, or if the harms would be better addressed by the states (for domestic topics) or the United Nations or some other country or non- governmental organization (for foreign topics). Even though a plan could be straightforwardly topical as to the resolution's policy agency, the action of the policy (the plan) has to justify the resolution by some standard, such as necessary and sufficient, for example. While logically these issues are distinguishable, in practice they might not be addressed individually or in any particular order. Other Components Other components have been advocated by advanced debaters and can be found during some tournament rounds of intercollegiate policy debate. These types of arguments or, sometimes, components of policy debate, can be linked to stock issues by good debaters. *Typicality: Is the Affirmative case or plan good enough for the resolution? If too generic, many other plans that could fall under the resolution could be run by the Negative, making Affirmative's Significance arguments nonunique or not significant enough. If too specific or complex, the atypicality of the Affirmative side is an extraordinary exception supporting the resolution which, while being straightforward, is difficult to support readily. Typicality is often used as an argument by either side to avoid clash on Topicality. The debate world's pet term for atypical plans is squirrelly: squirrelly cases, squirrelly arguments, squirrelly variety of policy debate. *Specificity: Is the resolution and the Affirmative case correctly, neatly, or clearly specifying what is to be debated? A vague resolution is difficult for the Affirmative to support and, hence, difficult for the Negative to challenge, the problem of the \\"moving target\\" or \\"patch of fog\\" resolution or plan. For example, if the Affirmative claims that not going with the resolution will end in evil and the devil will appear, the Affirmative has not yet met the stock issue burden of specifying anything in particular unique or significant or inherent or justifiable about arguing for or against the supposedly anti-devil resolution; that would be a fight to the death rather than a debate. Another example. The Negative can argue that the wording in the resolution is imprecise and that there is better diction for the meaning as stated. If say, the resolution is to \\"significantly enhance the prospects of\\" some social-economic class, the unintended consequence of such a resolution allows for Affirmative plans to include prostitution, anarchy, human trafficking, and such vices. The Negative has to straightforwardly argue what the better diction is, for example, that the resolution is to \\"significantly enhance the economic standard of living of\\" some social-economic group of persons. *Grounds: Is the format, stock issue outline, or allowances within the debate round fair to both sides? Grounds is often argued by both sides that certain types of arguments unfairly overscope, overly limit, or overburdens one side's pool of arguments in favor of the other side. Many frowned upon experimental arguments lose debate grounds and are not encouraged by debate coaches and judges, because they detract from the educational value of the activity. Policy debate is organized, attentive, and formalized to a fair degree, with etiquette and usual expectations of good demeanor in speech. Arguments that diminish the value of debating are argued at the Grounds level of debate. For example, because the Affirmative usually runs a case and has to demonstrate stock issue burdens have been cleared, running a values-versus- virtue debate on the Negative to shift the debate's qualitative format and tone to Lincoln-Douglas steals ground from policy debate. Subversion is a high-level Grounds debate, often brought up by the Affirmative. The Affirmative is granted \\"good faith\\" in supporting the resolution at the beginning of the debate round. A Negative position that undermines that good faith without direct argumentation is considered subversive. Some examples: kritik is a subversion, homophobia and misogyny against sources cited is subversion, punditry creep or discursiveness is a subversion, provisional plans and tentative counterplans that need too many moving parts in place in order to work by not assuming fiat are also subversive, omniscience and speculative politicking is subversive. Negative subversion is difficult for the Affirmative to counter, in which the Negative can validly argue that changing the status quo is subversive, has dire unknown consequences, a form of Negative Inherency that seeks to preserve the underlying value of the resolution without the stated resolution itself, such as in clandestine operations by C.I.A. For example, inadvertently removing certain treaties outside of the resolution is not good for the resolution. *Nonpolicy solutions: Are there nonpolicy actions that can be taken within the scope of the resolution? For example, it can be argued that changing out the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a significant workflow solution within the status quo policy that also supports the resolution. The area of leadership studies claims efficient solutions, limited to the few, to institutional problems incurred by the many. These are considered \\"emergency measures\\" that have already been planned for or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, are categorized as \\"ordinary ado\\". Usually, the substock issue burden granted to these types of argument is \\"reasonably feasible\\", where at least the reasonableness part of the solution as a duty has already been accounted for by the status quo. Another example. \\"Technically\\", prayer is not a policy solution but a cultural tradition. A policy that allows for or disallows prayer can be debated, but the prayers themselves are not subject to policy inspection nor oversight. Prayer is a valid support of the resolution, such as practiced by some state courts as a \\"call to action\\". The nonpolicy call to action is a Model U.N.-style of debate such as \\"urging\\", \\"recommending\\", \\"condoning\\", or some policy position that is important to the policy itself but does not substitute for policy. Arguments from supersystem or transcendental arguments are above-and-beyond policy, such as arguments for regime change. Such arguments rank regime higher than policy, because regimes follow many policies concurrently. In another example, an exciting debate round narrows the policy under consideration between process legalism and virtue ethics that affects many policies concurrently, capturing, supporting, or eschewing the resolution. In a different example, revolution is a quirky argument that has seen some support in academic policy debate circles, where it is argued that all important policies have broken down and the only realistic solution is revolution, the \\"moment of change\\" argument. Interest arguments clarify interests or values, to change policy debate itself affecting both the resolution and the types of policy plans that can be considered by Affirmative and Negative sides. For example, an Affirmative running an \\"environment case\\" on a \\"climate change\\" topic will clash with a Negative case that gives evidence to support the argument that scientists have been the lackeys of politicians and that statistical evidence for climate change are the effects to policy causation rather than scientific discovery activities that are poorly understood by the layman as if discovery activities are done independent of policies, which they are not. *Idempotency: Is the plan or resolution redundant to the status quo? Idempotency gives clear case argument against redundancy. If something is done once or is already initiated, there is no countervailing need to redo certain steps in or repeat certain portions of the policy plan, the argument from incremental idempotency. Segmented idempotency argues that there exists unnecessary steps or components of the policy plan, whether proposed or existing in the status quo. Affirmative Idempotency grants stock issue burden clearance or good faith that the Affirmative is assumed to not be redundant to the resolution itself but is a specimen of the species, or to the status quo but is a qualified implementation of the non-status quo resolution. On the theory side of in- round debate, Argumentation Idempotency is known as to \\"lump and dump\\", which is to take many arguments at once and debate their merits in one strong, succinct argument. Negative Idempotency, if argued well, can capture Affirmative Uniqueness with a lower burden of proof but greater stylistic flair for the speaker. *Intrisic, or Integrity: Argument from intrinsic values is a type of Inherency argument, whereas argument from Integrity is a Justification argument; it has rarely been argued the other way around, that intrinsic values belong to Justification and integrity belongs to Inherency, because that is the presumption of the status quo, and the Negative tends to clash with the Affirmative rather than supporting the status quo. These types of Inherency-versus-Justification debates sometime clash, that is, give good opposition or direct differentiation between them. Are the values assumed by the resolution intrinsic to the interests of the policy plan? Are the values assumed by the policy plan intrinsic to the goals of the resolution? And vice- versa. Likewise, is the integrity of the resolution-as-policy preserved or enhanced by the plan? Is the plan's integrity necessary to affirm the resolution? Intrinsic-integrity tend to differ from argument-for instrumentality but not much from argument-from instrumentality. Instrumentality is the deciding factor of which policy plan or position, in implementation as an instrument of a value, upholds the better set of values overall: the status quo, the Affirmative supporting the resolution, or the Negative undermining the Affirmative. Instrumentality evaluates feasibility and best-fit at the same time within a values debate judgment about policy interests rather that straight weighing of advantages and disadvantages of stock issue burdens. It is rare but does occur in debate rounds that the stock issues approach is not the best way to evaluate advantages and disadvantages because stock issues overly focus on harms and there is a cost or risk burden when participating in certain policies that would be dangerous to the implementing agency or benefits recipient group. The difference is not what one can do as a plan or should do as a resolution but what is best to do, rightly understood, as policy debate. For example, in order to affirm the resolution, the Affirmative can challenge that debate against the resolution must not censure the Press, for national security reasons. On the other hand, with direct clash, the Negative could counter that any topical debate must not avoid censuring the Press sometimes, for protected free speech reasons different from propaganda. Another example. One could advocate the position that the Pentagon is under threat from prayerful worship. Because the Pentagon are agents of war or representatives of time-consuming war studies maintenance and exercises, passive prayerful worship captures Significance by nullifying disruptions endemic in militaristic policy solutions. The underlying values between the two positions are at odds with one another. *Nullification: Does the plan sustain the resolution? The Nullification argument is also known as \\"plan eats resolution\\", in which some part or instance or iteration of the plan nullifies the resolution entirely, having shifted away from the resolution. This type of argument allows for only partial Inherency and partial Topicality, challenging total Significance. Resolution decompletedness is the argument, typically argued by the Negative by inflating Significance. For example, if the resolution desires \\"significant increase in the use of\\" some policy element and the plan, under some weird condition, has taken away all need for any use, then the resolution becomes moot because the plan is too successful. Case topics such as nuclear weapons tend to run into this issue, in which \\"significant use of\\" anti-nuclear deterrence does not achieve the same solvency as deproliferation but the opposite, heightening threat awareness linked to civil unrest.

In 1952, it was reorganized into the Tokyo National Research Institute for Cultural Properties with the establishment of departments of Fine Arts, Performing Arts, Conservation Sciences, and General Affairs. A department of Restoration Techniques was added in 1973 and an archive set up in 1977. The Division of International Cooperation for Conservation was established in 1993 and then converted into the Japan Center for International Exchange in Conservation in 1995, expanding the Institute to its present scale. Also in 1995, a graduate course was established in cooperation with Tokyo University of the Arts(東京芸術大学, Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku).

He was one of the founders of the Bukharim neighborhood in Jerusalem. He was also the patriarch of the Moussaieff clan, which includes such notable personalities as Shlomo Moussaieff of London, Dorrit Moussaieff of Iceland, and Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson. Early life Moussaieeff was born in the city of Bukhara in 1852, in what is today Uzbekistan. As a child, he studied under Rabbi David Chafin and Joshua Shushan. Joining him in his studies were Yosef Kohjinoff, Rafael Potihaloff, Moshe Cheh Yizhakoff, Avraham Aminoff Talmudi, and Aba Shimon Gaon. He was a learned man, with the honorary title of rabbi. As a merchant he engaged in the tea trade and real estate, and is said to have started one of the first banks in Bukhara. In 1888, motivated by religious convictions, he made aliyah to the Holy Land and was one of several Bukharan Jews responsible for founding the new Jerusalem neighborhood of Rehovot HaBukharim (later shortened to Bukharim) in 1891. He himself built a complex of apartments for use by 25 poor families, which included four synagogues. Today the Moussaieff complex of synagogues, which now numbers eight synagogues, is in continuous use. In the prayer book which he authored, Hukat Olam, Moussaieff described his motivation in moving to Jerusalem and his religious conviction: > \\"I, Shlomo Moussaieff, native of Bukhara.. My spirit moved me to leave the > land of my birth, in which I grew up, and to ascend to the Holy Land, the > land in which our ancestors dwelled in happiness, the land whose memory > passes before us ten times each day in our prayers...We do not have any > festive occasion without a memorial to Jerusalem....There is no doubt that I > am required to thank God for all the good he has done for me. He has brought > me across the sea three times. He has kept me alive, and has brought me to > the place of my desire for the good life and peace to see the pleasantness > of God and to visit his sanctuary. If the temple was standing, I would bring > a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Now because of our sins there is no temple and > no priest to bring the sacrifice. Therefore I had the idea to help the many > and publish these prayer books for the weekdays and Sabbath and holidays. > Prayer is a substitute for sacrifice. Prayer to God is what connects Israel > to their Father in Heaven, although the Israelite nation has been vanquished > in exile for more than eighteen hundred years\\". From the late 19th century until World War I, the Bukharim neighborhood was one of the most affluent sections of the city, populated by Bukharan Jewish merchants and religious scholars supported primarily by various trading activities such as cotton, gemstones, and tea in Central Asia and Russia. After World War I and the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, however, the neighborhood fell into decline as overseas sources of income were cut off and residents were left with just their homes in Jerusalem, forcing them to subdivide and rent out rooms to bring in income. The Revolution also brought a flood of impoverished Russian Jewish refugees to the neighborhood. Later Jews from Persia and Iran joined the mix, and overcrowding became rife. From being lauded as one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Bukharim earned the opposite sobriquet, of being the poorest neighborhood of Jerusalem. Today Bukharim's original glory can still be seen in a few restored houses, but many buildings are dilapidated or in ruins. Many houses have been demolished in favor of new construction. The population profile has also changed: today most residents are Haredi. Other interests As a religious scholar, Moussaieff was also a collector of rare religious texts and manuscripts of Maimonides and Rabbi Haim Vital. This collection is currently housed in a special collection in the Bar-Ilan University library. Personal The family name, Moussaieff, was taken from Shlomo Moussaieff's ancestor, Moshe or Musa, the son of Yakov, who was born in 1771 and died in 1843. Moshe was the grandfather of Shlomo Moussaieff. Moussaieff's father was named Yakov who was born in 1812 and died in Jerusalem in 1892. Yakov Moussaieff's wife, Sarah, died in Bukhara in 1889. Shlomo Moussaieff married Esther Gaonoff, who traced her ancestry to Yosef Maimon, originally of Tetuan, Morocco, who arrived in Bukhara in the late 18th century and revived Rabbinic learning there. Maman married Hannah, the daughter of Mullah Jan Tajah of Sharisabz. Their daughter, Miriam, married Mullah Pinhas Hakatan (d. 1875), a renowned Rabbi, called by the missionary and traveler, Joseph Wolff, \\"the most learned of the Jews of Bukhara\\" and \\"a young man of extraordinary talents\\". Malka, the daughter of Pinhas Hakatan, married Avraham Haim Gaon. According to legend, Avraham Haim Gaon traveled from Bukhara to Jerusalem on a lion's back as recounted by his grandson, Raphael Gaon: > Avraham Haim Gaon decided to travel to Jerusalem. He prepared himself and > others for the long trip and they set off traveling via Afghanistan. In > Afghanistan, they hired a guide who instructed them to travel by way of the > Indian desert and from there to Jerusalem. The group traveled for a week. > When the Sabbath was about to begin, Avraham Haim Gaon suggested to the > group that they stop traveling until after the Sabbath. The members of the > group, however, consulted with the guide who told them that the area they > were in was inhabited by dangerous animals and they must leave immediately > for safer ground. Avraham Haim Gaon decided to stay while the others, due to > fear, left. He made the kiddush, ate as was customary, slept well, and rose > and prayed. When the Sabbath was over, he noticed a lion approaching and > very much afraid, he took hold of his equipment. But then the lion crawled > between his legs and carried him.\\" Avraham Haim Gaon was the father of > Esther Gaonoff and of the renowned Rabbi Aba Shimon Gaon. He died in 1910 in > Jerusalem. Moussaieff and his wife had seven children: Yehuda, Sam, Henri,Father of Jacques, grandfather of Jeffrey Masson. Maurice, Rehavia (who was named after the neighborhood Moussaieff helped found, Rehovot HaBukharim, Sarah, and Bat Sheva. Moussaieff's sons mostly moved abroad, to France, England and then to the United States. They primarily engaged in trade in pearls and precious stones from India, South East Asia, and South America. His son Sam (Shlomo), a self made millionaire, bought the Aleppo Codex and brought it to Israel. Death Moussaieff was devoutly religious and committed to living in the Land of Israel. On his deathbed, he stipulated in his oral will that only those of his sons who lived in the Land of Israel would receive his inheritance. Much of his property in the Bukharim quarter was declared a \\"religious endowment\\" (hekdesh in Hebrew and waqf in Arabic), which could not be sold for perpetuity. Till this day, proceeds from rentals of his property are received by the direct male descendants of Moussaieff who live in Israel. Moussaieff died at the age of 70 in 1922. He and several of his sons are buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

Situated in the southwestern part of Łódź Voivodeship (since 1999), From 1975–1998, it was part of Kalisz Voivodeship. The town is situated along the Prosna river. The biggest attraction is the Church and Monastery popauliński of 1676 in its limits, located on the Prosna, the church of St. Nicholas. Spirit of the façade with two towers and chapels on the sides, forming a kind of transept. Inside the church, deserves special attention, nine baroque altars and choir stalls from 1682, with paintings on zapieckach. The choir is a portrait of Bernard Wierusz - the first owner and founder of the church Wieruszów. In 1673, Augustine's father died here Kordecki, a heroic defender of Jasna Góra during the Swedish invasion, and in 1973, during the celebration of the 300th anniversary of his death diagonal, the church was graced by the presence of Cardinal Karol Wojtyła - the future Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. Until World War II, the town had a significant Jewish population of more than 2000. When the Germans occupied the town in September 1939, they immediately killed several Jews and kidnapped others. Over the next two years, they kidnapped Jews for forced labor, required them to live in a ghetto in the poorest part of town, turning over their former residences to Poles, and sent both men and women to work camps near Poznan. In August 1942, the remaining Jews were rounded up and held in a local monastery for several days. Several Jews were murdered there. Others were sent to the Lodz ghetto, and the remainder, perhaps 800-900, were taken by train to the killing camp at Chelmno where they were immediately gassed. After that, local Poles were forced to move into the houses vacated by Jewish townspeople. After the war, a few Jewish survivors returned to Wieruszów but left after several Jews were murdered by Polish nationalists in the vicinity. The number of survivors is unknown.

It is a soil-dwelling bacterium endemic in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly in Thailand and northern Australia. It infects humans and animals and causes the disease melioidosis. It is also capable of infecting plants. B. pseudomallei measures 2–5 μm in length and 0.4–0.8 μm in diameter and is capable of self-propulsion using flagella. The bacteria can grow in a number of artificial nutrient environments, especially betaine- and arginine- containing ones. In vitro, optimal proliferation temperature is reported around 40 °C in neutral or slightly acidic environments (pH 6.8–7.0). The majority of strains are capable of oxidation, not fermentation, of sugars without gas formation (most importantly, glucose and galactose; older cultures are reported to also metabolize maltose and starch). Bacteria produce both exo- and endotoxins. The role of the toxins identified in the process of melioidosis symptom development has not been fully elucidated.  Identification  B. pseudomallei is not fastidious and grows on a large variety of culture media (blood agar, MacConkey agar, EMB, etc.). Ashdown's medium (or Burkholderia cepacia medium) may be used for selective isolation. Cultures typically become positive in 24 to 48 hours (this rapid growth rate differentiates the organism from B. mallei, which typically takes a minimum of 72 hours to grow). Colonies are wrinkled, have a metallic appearance, and possess an earthy odour. On Gram staining, the organism is a Gram-negative rod with a characteristic \\"safety pin\\" appearance (bipolar staining). On sensitivity testing, the organism appears highly resistant (it is innately resistant to many antibiotics including colistin and gentamicin) and that again differentiates it from B. mallei, which is in contrast, exquisitely sensitive to many antibiotics. For environmental specimens only, differentiation from the nonpathogenic B. thailandensis using an arabinose test is necessary (B. thailandensis is never isolated from clinical specimens). The laboratory identification of B. pseudomallei has been described in the literature. The classic textbook description of B. pseudomallei in clinical samples is of an intracellular, bipolar-staining, Gram-negative rod, but this is of little value in identifying the organism from clinical samples. Some suggest the Wayson stain is useful for this purpose, but this has been shown not to be the case. Laboratory identification of B. pseudomallei can be difficult, especially in Western countries where it is rarely seen. The large, wrinkled colonies look like environmental contaminants, so are often discarded as being of no clinical significance. Colony morphology is very variable and a single strain may display multiple colony types, so inexperienced laboratory staff may mistakenly believe the growth is not pure. The organism grows more slowly than other bacteria that may be present in clinical specimens, and in specimens from nonsterile sites, is easily overgrown. Nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be cultured in selective media (e.g., Ashdown's or B. cepacia medium). For heavily contaminated samples, such as faeces, a modified version of Ashdown's that includes norfloxacin, amoxicillin, and polymyxin B has been proposed. In blood culture, the BacT/ALERT MB system (normally used for culturing mycobacteria) by bioMérieux has been shown to have superior yields compared to conventional blood culture media. Even when the isolate is recognised to be significant, commonly used identification systems may misidentify the organism as Chromobacterium violaceum or other nonfermenting, Gram-negative bacilli such as Burkholderia cepacia or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Again, because the disease is rarely seen in Western countries, identification of B. pseudomallei in cultures may not actually trigger alarms in physicians unfamiliar with the disease. Routine biochemical methods for identification of bacteria vary widely in their identification of this organism: the API 20NE system accurately identifies B. pseudomallei in 99% of cases, as does the automated Vitek 1 system, but the automated Vitek 2 system only identifies 19% of isolates. The pattern of resistance to antimicrobials is distinctive, and helps to differentiate the organism from P. aeruginosa. The majority of B. pseudomallei isolates are intrinsically resistant to all aminoglycosides (via an efflux pump mechanism), but sensitive to co-amoxiclav: this pattern of resistance almost never occurs in P. aeruginosa and is helpful in identification. Unfortunately, the majority of strains in Sarawak, Borneo, are susceptible to aminoglycosides and macrolides, which means the conventional recommendations for isolation and identification do not apply there. Molecular methods (PCR) of diagnosis are possible, but not routinely available for clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation has also been described, but has not been clinically validated, and it is not commercially available. In Thailand, a latex agglutination assay is widely used, while a rapid immunofluorescence technique is also available in a small number of centres.  Disinfection  B. pseudomallei is susceptible to numerous disinfectants, including benzalkonium chloride, iodine, mercuric chloride, potassium permanganate, 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70% ethanol, 2% glutaraldehyde, and to a lesser extent, phenolic preparations. B. pseudomallei is effectively killed by the commercial disinfectants, Perasafe and Virkon. The microorganism can also be destroyed by heating to above 74 °C for 10 min or by ultraviolet irradiation.  Medical importance  B. pseudomallei infection in humans is called melioidosis; its mortality is 20 to 50% even with treatment.  Antibiotic treatment and sensitivity testing  The antibiotic of choice is ceftazidime. While various antibiotics are active in vitro (e.g., chloramphenicol, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole), they have been proven to be inferior in vivo for the treatment of acute melioidosis. Disc diffusion tests are unreliable when looking for co-trimoxazole resistance in B. pseudomallei (they greatly overestimate resistance) and Etests or agar dilution tests should be used in preference. The actions of co-trimoxazole and doxycycline are antagonistic, which suggests these two drugs ought not to be used together. The organism is intrinsically resistant to gentamicin and colistin, and this fact is helpful in the identification of the organism. Kanamycin is used to kill B. pseudomallei in the laboratory, but the concentrations used are much higher than those achievable in humans.  Pathogenicity mechanisms and virulence factors  B. pseudomallei is an opportunistic pathogen. An environmental organism, it has no requirement to pass through an animal host to replicate. From the point of view of the bacterium, human infection is a developmental \\"dead end\\". Strains which cause disease in humans differ from those causing disease in other animals, by possessing certain genomic islands. It may have the ability to cause disease in humans because of DNA it has acquired from other microorganisms. Its mutation rate is also high, and the organism continues to evolve even after infecting a host. B. pseudomallei is able to invade cells (it is an intracellular pathogen). It is able to polymerise actin, and to spread from cell to cell, causing cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated giant cells. It possesses a uniquely fusogenic type VI secretion system that is required for cell-cell spread and virulence in mammalian hosts. The bacterium also expresses a toxin called lethal factor 1. B. pseudomallei is one of the first Proteobacteria to be identified as containing an active type VI secretion system. It is also the only organism identified that contains up to six different type VI secretion systems. B. pseudomallei is intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents by virtue of its efflux pump mechanism. This mediates resistance to aminoglycosides (AmrAB-OprA), tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides (BpeAB-OprB). Vaccine candidates No vaccine is currently available, but a number of vaccine candidates have been suggested. Aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) gene deletion mutants are auxotrophic for diaminopimelate (DAP) in rich media and auxotrophic for DAP, lysine, methionine and threonine in minimal media. The Δasd bacterium (bacterium with the asd gene removed) protects against inhalational melioidosis in mice.

The hamlet of Stacey Bank is located to the east. The reservoir has a capacity of 4,250.9 million litres (1,123.1 million gallons) and has a surface area of 47 hectares (116 acres) with a maximum depth of 27 metres (88 ft). The dam wall is approximately 400 metres (1,312 ft) wide with a height of 28 metres (92 ft).  Construction  Damflask reservoir was built as one of a group of reservoirs in the Bradfield area (the others being Strines, Agden and Dale Dike reservoirs) to supply both fresh drinking water and a guaranteed supply of running water to the population and industries respectively of Sheffield. It was completed in 1896 with the dam walls being constructed from local stone, and its original purpose was primarily as a compensation reservoir to ensure a continuous flow of water to the River Loxley downstream. It takes its name from Damflask village which was washed away in the Great Sheffield flood of 11 March 1864; the village stood near the site of the current dam wall and had a public house (Barrell Inn), corn mill, paper mill, wire mill, blacksmith's shop and a few dwellings. The village was never rebuilt after the flood because plans were already in hand to construct Damflask Reservoir. Damflask Reservoir seen from the dam wall with the hill of Ughill Heights in the background.  Ownership and use  Damflask Reservoir was built by the Sheffield Waterworks Company, and is owned today by Yorkshire Water which is part of the Kelda Group; they have opened the facility to various recreational groups. Two rowing clubs Sheffield University Rowing Club and Sheffield Hallam University Rowing Club) are all active on the reservoir as is the Sheffield Viking Sailing Club. It is also open to anglers all the year round who fish mainly for Bream, Pike, Roach and European perch. The woodlands around the reservoir have always been popular with walkers although they were restricted to permitted paths and rights of way for many years. However, in August 2002 Yorkshire Water opened all the area under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, allowing access to previously restricted areas. A £60,000 project was completed by Yorkshire Water at the start of 2015 to allow better access for disabled people to the circular walking route around the reservoir. This includes widening of access points to allow wheelchair entry, tactile paving and improved information boards.Sheffield Star (accessed 6 April 2015) Gives details of disabled access.

At this conference, governments from around the world agreed on a comprehensive plan to achieve global legal equality, known as the Beijing Platform for Action.  Background  UN charter logo The founding United Nations charter (1945) included a provision for equality between men and women (chapter III, article 8). Subsequently, from 1945 to 1975 various female officials within the United Nations and leaders of women's movements on the global stage attempted to turn these principles into action. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution (resolution 3010) that 1975 should be International Women's Year. In December 1975, the UN General Assembly passed a further resolution (resolution 31/136) that 1976–1985 should be the \\"Decade of Women\\". = First World Conference on Women, Mexico City, 1975 = In conjunction with International Women's Year, the first world conference on women was held in Mexico City in 1975. It resulted in the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace. = Second World Conference on Women, Copenhagen, 1980 = The second world conference on women was held in Copenhagen in 1980. The conference agreed that the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was an important milestone. The Copenhagen conference also acknowledged the gap between rights being secured for women and women's ability to exercise those rights. It was also agreed that it was action on the three areas of: equal access to education; employment opportunities; and adequate health care services are essential to achieve the goals set out in Mexico. = Third World Conference on Women, Nairobi, 1985 = The third world conference on women was held in Nairobi in 1985. The Nairobi conference set out areas by which progress in women's equality could be measured: constitutional and legal measures; equality in social participation; equality in political participation; and decision-making. The conference also acknowledged that women need to participate in all areas of human activity, not just those areas that relate to gender. = Preceding the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 1995 = Delegates had prepared a Declaration and Platform for Action aimed at achieving greater equality and opportunity for women.  Attendees  Chilean politicians attending the conference. Beijing International Convention Center, where the conference was held The conference was attended by representatives of 189 governments, UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union and League of Arab States, as well as activists and organizations from across the world. There were 17,000 participants, with a further 30,000 activists attending a parallel Forum. Gertrude Mongella of Tanzania was the secretary- general of the conference. Aung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the conference. A full list of the statements made by attendees can be found on the UN website.  Speeches  a speech during the conference. Hillary Rodham Clinton, at the time the First Lady of the United States, gave the speech Women's Rights Are Human Rights at the conference on 5 September 1995. That speech is considered to be influential in the women's rights movement, and in 2013 Clinton led a review of how women's rights have changed since her 1995 speech. The 1995 speech was listed as No. 35 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). > \\"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, it is that > human rights are women's rights.... And women's rights are human rights. Let > us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely. And the > right to be heard.

Sexuality is an integral, deeply ingrained part of > every human being's life and should not be subject to debate or coercion. > Anyone who is truly committed to women's human rights must recognize that > every woman has the right to determine her sexuality free of discrimination > and oppression. I urge you to make this a conference for all women, > regardless of their sexual orientation, and to recognize in the Platform for > Action that lesbian rights are women's rights and that women's rights are > universal, inalienable, and indivisible human rights.\\" --Beverly Palesa > Ditsie Many other speeches were also given at the conference, on behalf of governments, the United Nations and inter-governmental organizations, and non- governmental organizations.  The Beijing Platform for Action  The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is widely known as the most progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights. The framework covers 12 areas of concern: # Women and the environment # Women in power and decision making # The girl child # Women and the economy # Women and poverty # Violence against women # Human rights of women # Education and training of women # Institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women # Women and health # Women and the media # Women and armed conflict = Beijing Platform for Action = A summary of the Beijing Platform for Action is given below: = Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women = A major result of the conference was the Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women, signed at the NGO Forum in the Indigenous Women's Tent. This document seeks, in part, to reconcile the tension felt by Indigenous women activists and Indigenous movements dominated by men. It was a significant step forward towards Indigenous women's rights and a significant victory for Indigenous feminism practice. The 50-point declaration provides the rationale and a clear call to action for governments navigating Indigenous issues across the globe. The demands in the document are \\"that all governments and international non- governmental and governmental organizations recognize the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, and enshrine the historical, political, social, cultural, economic, and religious rights of the Indigenous peoples in their constitutions and legal systems.\\" From that premise, the declaration goes on to specify areas for action including self-determination; development, education and health; human rights violations and violence against Indigenous women; intellectual and cultural heritage; and political participation. The document addresses the unique problems Indigenous women suffer in addition to those suffered by Indigenous men, which include erosion of culture (and gender roles therein), loss of traditional land, and compromised identity and status in the spaces they inhabit. As its bases, the declaration cites the \\"UN Declaration of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples, the Draft Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous peoples, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, and the Copenhagen Social Summit Declaration.\\"  Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture  Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture was a project founded by artist and project director Nancy Cusick and gave women artists the opportunity to participate in the dialogue at the World Conference of Women. Women artists from around the world used their chosen media as a vehicle to produce work that evoked the universal issues paramount to women, their lives, and their position within the framework of society. Co-sponsored by the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA), Global Focus presented an art exhibition, a video festival, slide presentations, performance pieces, and workshops that showed the artistic accomplishments and creativity of women. Most of the 880 artworks, produced by women artists from 27 countries, were displayed at the World Trade Center in Beijing, China. A smaller group of works were also exhibited in Hairou, China. These artworks formed a visual landscape of powerful images that immortalized the women’s issues and themes which encompassed the conference—Equality, Development, and Peace. Following the exhibition of the Global Focus artworks in Beijing, China, the corpus of works traveled to various international locations. Immediately after the close of the Beijing exhibit, a selection of 53 American paintings were displayed at the Elite Gallery in Moscow from October to November 1995. Subsequently, in November 1995, a selection of 200 works adorned the walls of the art gallery at the United States Department of Health and Human Services in Washington D.C. Simultaneously, another group of artworks from the collection were exhibited at the United State Information Agency also in Washington D.C. On March 20, 1996, the first public showing of the collection in the United States opened at NMWA in Washington D.C. with a day-long celebration revisiting and reflecting upon the experiences in Beijing. This exhibition, titled \\"Look at the World Through Women’s Eyes\\", was on display through April 21, 1996. On September 28, 1996, the collection was exhibited at George Washington University in Washington D.C. during the National Women’s Satellite Conference hosted by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. From April to June 1997, a selection of 300 works from the collection were exhibited at the Peace Museum in Detroit. The last public display of the Global Focus exhibit was shown during the 20th Anniversary Celebration of the 1977 Spirit of Houston Conference in Washington D.C. After this final showing, the large group of artworks ended its journey, and the entire collection was presented by the project co-directors Nancy Cusick and Mal Johnson to the archives of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Commemoration Fourth World Conference on Women Commemorative Park in Huairou District, Beijing On 28 September 2004, the Fourth World Conference on Women Commemorative Park was officially opened in Huairou District, where the NGO forum was held. In 2014 UN Women began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women with the Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture It! campaign, also called the Beijing+20 campaign. In 2019, UN Women launched the Generation Equality Campaign and Generation Equality Forum to \\"tackle the unfinished business of empowering women through a new groundbreaking, multi- generational campaign, Generation Equality: Realizing women’s rights for an equal future.\\" Also called Beijing +25, the campaign and forum are being organized in collaboration with members of civil society, and are meant to serve as the planning events, along with the 64th Session of the UN's Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), in the lead up to a UN General Assembly high-level meeting in New York on September 23, 2020. In 2019, at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, governments agreed to present their commitments and planned activities to bring about gender equality by 2030 at a one-day session during the 74th session in 2020. The demands of the Generation Equality Campaign include \\"equal pay, equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work, an end to sexual harassment and all forms of violence against women and girls, health-care services that respond to their needs, and their equal participation in political life and decision-making in all areas of life.\\" The Generation Equality Forum is being convened by UN Women, and co- chaired by Mexico and France. The Forum will begin in Mexico City, May 7–8, 2020 and will conclude in Paris, France from 7-10 of July, 2020. Discussions and reviews of progress on the Beijing Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) will also take place at the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, in New York, on March 9-20, 2020. On 1 October 2020, the High-Level Meeting on the 25th Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women was held, where China proposed another Global Leaders' Meeting on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in 2025.

She is a recipient of the National Prize for Literature.  Life  Diamela Eltit graduated from college from Universidad Católica de Chile and pursued graduate studies in Literature at the Universidad de Chile in Santiago. In 1977, she began a teaching career in public high schools in Santiago, including Instituto Nacional and Liceo Carmela Carvajal. In 1984, she started teaching at universities in Chile, where she is currently professor at the Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana and abroad. She has been held visiting professorships at the University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, Washington University in Saint Louis, and University of Pittsburgh, University of Virginia. Since 2007, New York University, she has been a Distinguished Global Visiting Professor and teaches at the Creative Writing Program in Spanish. Eltit was the 2014-2015 Simon Bolivar Chair at the Center of Latin American Studies at Cambridge. In 2013 Princeton University acquired her archive, which includes manuscripts, letters, and photographs. In 1973, after the military coup in Chile, she started publishing her writings. When democracy returned in 1990 she became a cultural attaché at the Chilean Embassy in Mexico until 1994. She was a representative of the Council of Chilean Universities to the Book National Council. She writes opinions por El Desconcierto, both in Santiago. In 1979, Eltit created together with the poet Raúl Zurita, the visual artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo and the sociologist Fernando Balcells the Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA), a vanguard group part of the so-called Escena de Avanzada. CADA struggled for reformulating artistic circuits under the Pinochet dictatorship. In 1980, Eltit published her first book, Una milla de cruces sobre el pavimento, a volume of essays. Her first novel, Lumpérica, appeared in 1983 in Ediciones del Ornitorrinco, a small editorial from Santiago. The text dedicated to Eltit in the internet cultural portal Memoria Chilena, explains that 1980s was complicated for the Chilean intellectuals that had to elaborate strategies to publish and circulate their work in a cultural environment where censorship existed. In this context, women publications were a significant contribution because they generated renewed spaces of thinking on political issues and subjects as sexuality, authoritarianism, domestic life and gender identity. Eltit was part of this new generation and not only articulated an original literary project —a theoretical, esthetic, social and political proposal with a new reading space as perspective—, but also developed a visual work as a member of CADA\\". Several of Eltit’s novels have been staged by different theater groups and translated into other languages. In 2012 the Spanish editorial house Periférica reached an agreement with Diamela Eltit to republish all her novels. Three of Eltit novels were chosen as part of the list selected in 2007 by 81 Latin American and Spanish writers and critics for the Colombian journal Semana of the 100 best novels in Spanish language in the last 25 years: Lumpérica (Nº58), El cuarto mundo (Nº67) y Los vigilantes (Nº100). In 2016 the journal Babelia, in Spain, selected one of Eltit's novels as one of the best 25 of century XXI. Eltit's work has been the object of many studies. Casa de las Américas, in La Habana, dedicated to Eltit her Semana de Autor in 2002, and in 2006, the Universidad Católica de Chile organized the Coloquio Internacional de Escritores y Críticos: Homenaje a Diamela Eltit, which resulted in the book Diamela Eltit: redes locales, redes globales (Iberoamericana, 2009) Eltit has two daughters and a son. She is married to Jorge Arrate, lawyer and economist. Her husband is the former President of the Socialist Party. In 2009 he was a presidential candidate representing a coalition between the Communist Party and socialist, humanist and Christian left groups.

It is based on the manga of the same title by Tsutomu Takahashi and serves as a prequel to a Japanese television drama of the same name, and starring the same actress, Yumiko Shaku. Although the film is a prequel to the series, the film was made while the series was still in production, sometime between the first and second seasons. The film had a clear effect on the direction of the second season, as evidenced in the look and style of Mina/Izuko's second season costuming—more similar to the darker, edgier look she sports in the film,Sky High, Season 2 as opposed to the softer, colourful, kimono-like outfit of the first season.Sky High, Season 1 - ASky High, Season 1 - B The film reveals how the somewhat meek Mina became the heroic Izuko, as seen in the series (and the film’s action climax). Plot A serial killer is on the loose who just so happens to also be removing the hearts of his victims and taking them with him. His victims however, are not merely random humans as thought by the police. They are in fact, the past and present guardians of the gateway of the afterlife. On the day he is to be married, Detective Kanzaki, who happens to be on the case, discovers that his fiancé Mina has been murdered with her heart also missing. He also learns that the killers are Kudo, a geneticist, and his evil secretary Rei. The two are trying to obtain six hearts from the guardians so that they may call forth a horde of demons from the Gate of Rage and have their every desire granted. Only problem is, once they open the gate the entire world will be covered in darkness. Meanwhile, in the afterlife, Mina encounters Izuko, the Guardian of the Gate. Izuko gives her three options: Mina can choose to ascend to heaven and be reborn, she can choose to forever walk the earth as a ghost or she can choose to curse one of the living to death and as a result be cursed to descend to hell. Mina has 12 days to make her choice.  Multiple Genres  A big budget feature film prequel to a television series, Sky High is not an easy film to classify, as it comfortably fits into multiple genres. It is typically classified in the action or martial arts category, however it is very much a crime thriller about a cop (Kanzaki), whose fiancé (Mina) is only the latest victim in a series of macabre serial killings of young women. He uses his forensic skills as a detective to slowly uncover the identity of the killer—unknowingly aided by the ghost of Mina, who is desperately trying to figure out the identity of her own killer. The killer is revealed to be a woman (Rei) who is a fallen Guardian, risen from the dead; defeating her will require delving into fantasy and legend. Sky High is also a romance about love and loss as Mina faces a greater destiny ... becoming the new Guardian of the Gate and defending it against evil (the role her character plays in the television series). Production The film opened in Japanese theaters in late 2003. Its premiere followed in the footsteps of the popular Sky High television series, starring the same actress (Yumiko Shaku) in the lead role of Izuko—or specifically, the \\"new\\" Izuko, as the film is considered a prequel to the TV series, revealing how Mina Saeki (Shaku) came to replace the previous Guardian and take her position as the Izuko we see in the series. Although the film makes much greater use of action, martial arts, and big budget special effects than the series is capable, both follow the same continuity. TV-Asahi, the Japanese television network behind the TV series is also the theatrical film's primary production company. The movie is helmed by popular action director Ryuhei Kitamura, best known for his Versus series of films, as well as other popular draws such as Azumi and Godzilla: Final Wars. Kitamura also directed several episodes of the TV series, and following the film's box office success, Sky High 2 (or Season 2) was quickly put into production by the network for January 2004, utilizing many elements from the film, including its darker, edgier look, and improved sets and effects. The film's screenplay was written by Isao Kiriyama, based on the manga Sky High by Tsutomu Takahashi. The closing theme for the movie is \\"Horizon\\" by Hyde (L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps).

Since its independence from France in 1960, Chad has been swamped by the civil war between the Arab-Muslims of the north and the Sub-Saharan-Christians of the south. As a result, leadership and presidency in Chad drifted back and forth between the Christian southerners and Muslim northerners. When one side was in power, the other side usually started a revolutionary war to counter it. France, the former colonial power, and Chad's northern neighbour Libya have both become involved at various times throughout the civil war. By the mid-1990s the civil war had somewhat stabilised, and in 1996 Idriss Déby, a northerner, was confirmed president in Chad's first democratic election. In 1998 an armed rebellion began in the north, led by President Déby's former defence chief, Youssouf Togoimi. A Libyan peace deal in 2002 failed to put an end to the fighting. In 2003, conflict in the neighbouring Darfur region in Sudan leaked across the border into Chad. Refugees from Sudan were joined by Chadian civilians who were trying to escape rebel violence and eventually filled the camps. It was clear that Chad's rebels received weapons and assistance from the government of Sudan. At the same time, Sudan's rebels got help from Chad's government. In February 2008, three rebel groups joined forces and launched an attack on Chad's capital, N'Djamena. After launching an assault that failed to seize the presidential palace, the attack was decisively repulsed. France sent in troops to shore up the government. Many of the rebels were former allies of President Idriss Déby. They accused him of corruption towards members of his own tribe.  Causes  The battle at the start of December 2005 in the Chadian capital N'djamena came as no surprise. For the years prior to the eruption, the Sudanese government was trying to overthrow the Chadian president, Idriss Déby, using Chadian rebels as middle men. The three armed groups involved in attacks in 2008 were armed by Sudanese security forces intent on cutting off the support that Déby was giving to the rebels in Darfur, especially the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), which had been on the offensive in Darfur. The war in Chad was a result of four distinct forces. For one, the war appeared to be a continuation of the conflicts of Darfur and Chad, which include the competition for power and land. Secondly, there was an internal Chadian conflict. Déby reverted to a one-man military rule after a hopeful broadening of the base of his regime in the late 1990s which was coupled by the growth of civil politics in N'djamena. Déby relied heavily on a close-knit group of kinsmen and on claiming the allotted government finances for his own agenda, distributing aid in return for civilian loyalty. Third is Khartoum's (capital of Sudan) strategy for managing security within its border, which include treating the weak surrounding states as merely extensions of its internal limits. The Sudan security helped bring Déby to power in 1990 as part of their responsibility that also saw it engage militarily in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Central African Republic (CAR) over the military decade. In the same way that Khartoum used a combination of extortion and retribution to control its provincial elites in Darfur, it used the same tools to influence its trans-border limits. Furthermore, the regional competition for dominance through an immense area of central Africa has rarely been governed by state authority. This isolated area includes Chad, CAR, and northern DRC, as well as the areas of Tripoli and Sudan, with Kinshasa, Kigali, Kampala, and even Asmara are competing for influence across this area, as well as Khartoum. = Outcome = The implementation of the reforms promised in an August 2007 agreement with opposition parties was slow and uneven. Throughout the country, government forces continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain civilians and suspected rebels, often on the basis of ethnicity, and subject them to cruel and unusual punishment. Chad's prison conditions are among the harshest on the African continent. Weak institutions of justice contributed to a culture of exemption. The government has not investigated or prosecuted serious abuses against civilians, such as killings and rapes by government security forces and rebels following clashes at Am Dam in May 2009. More than 250,000 Sudanese refugees and 168,000 Chadian displaced people live in camps and elsewhere in eastern Chad. In April 2010, approximately 5,000 new Sudanese refugees arrived from West Darfur, following renewed fighting there between the Sudanese rebel group Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudanese government forces.  Belligerents  The conflict involved Chadian government forces and several Chadian rebel groups. These include the United Front for Democratic Change, United Forces for Development and Democracy, Gathering of Forces for Change and the National Accord of Chad. The conflict has also involved the Janjaweed, while Sudan allegedly supported the rebels, while Libya mediated in the conflict, as well as diplomats from other countries. Major Battles =SCUD Raid on Guéréda= Chadian rebels attacked Guéréda, 120 kilometers north of Adré, on 7 December 2005, leaving ten dead and five wounded. The attack (attributed to the Platform for Change, Unity and Democracy, SCUD, a group of Chadian military deserters) marked the beginning of a campaign of rebel incursions from Darfur and prompted the Chadian government to condemn Khartoum for backing the rebels.Human Rights Watch, “Darfur Bleeds: Recent Cross-Border Violence in Chad,” February 2006. =RDL Raid on Adré= On 18 December 2005, the Rassemblement pour la Démocratie et la Liberté (Rally for Democracy and Freedom, RDL), a Chadian rebel group based in Darfur, attacked the border town of Adré, Chad. Adré is the strategic key to Chad’s defense against attacks launched from Sudan. Chadian president Idriss Déby, prompted by defections from the Chadian army to Chadian rebel groups between October and December 2005, had begun reinforcing Adré, as well as Abéché, the capital of eastern Ouaddaï province, even before the 18 December 2005 attack. =First Battle of N’Djaména= In April 2006 Chadian rebel leader Mahamat Nour Abdelkarim, having brought together several Chadian rebel movements under the banner of the Front Uni pour le Changement (United Front for Change, FUC), laid siege to N’Djamena. On 13 April 2006, 1,200 to 1,500 FUC rebels in 56 pickup trucks dashed hundreds of kilometers across Chad from bases in Darfur and the Central African Republic to fight pitched gun battles with Chadian security forces on the streets of the capital city. The fighting in Ndjaména lasted from 5 am to 11 am and included armored personnel carriers, technicals (4-wheel drive vehicles mounted with heavy weapons) and tanks, and was concentrated in the southeastern suburbs and at the Palais des Quinze, Chad’s parliament, which rebel troops unfamiliar with the layout of the capital city mistook for the presidential palace. With considerable assistance from the French military, the takeover attempt was thwarted, with hundreds killed. Two mass graves are located in the southeastern suburbs of N’Djaména at a remote spot in Djari-Kawas, where government forces ambushed a rebel column. One mass grave was reported to contain 102 bodies, though reports conflict as to whether the dead were all rebel soldiers or a mix of rebels and civilians. The second mass grave at Djari-Kawas is said to contain 45 bodies that were buried there once they were released from the morgue at the central hospital. On 14 April 2006 Chad unilaterally severed relations with Sudan. Though the two countries renewed their pledge to expel rebels from their territories in July and restored diplomatic relations in August, the April attack continued to cast a pall over bilateral relations.Human Rights Watch, \\"They Came Here to Kill US: Militia Attacks and Ethnic Targeting of Civilians in Eastern Chad,\\" January 2007. =Second Battle of N’Djaména= Chadian rebels led by Mahamat Nouri fought government forces in pitched street battles in N’Djaména on the morning of 2 February 2008. By the afternoon of the next day, rebel forces withdrew from the capital, short on ammunition and unhinged by the possibility that one member of the coalition, Timan Erdimi, had sought a separate accommodation with the government. =Battle of Am Dam= The Battle of Am Dam took place in and around the eastern Chadian town of Am Dam on 7 and 8 May 2009 when Chadian Army forces attacked a column of advancing Union of Forces for the Resistance (UFR) rebels.  Peace process  =Withdrawal of the United Nations= In January 2009, the government of Chad requested that the United Nations begin the process of withdrawing the peacekeeping mission in eastern Chad. The Chad government cited the UN mission's slow deployment, uneven record of success, and improvements in the security situation as reasons for its decision. In May 2009, the UN revised the mission's mandate and authorized its gradual drawdown and closure by the end of the year, and effectively shifted full responsibility for the protection of civilians, including displaced populations and refugees from Darfur, to the Chadian security forces. =Harmony between Chad and Sudan= An agreement for the restoration of harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed 15 January 2010, marked the end of a five-year war. The fix in relations led to the Chadian rebels from Sudan returning home, the opening of the border between the two countries after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border. President Idriss Déby visited Khartoum, in February for the first time in six years; and in July, Chad, a state party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), hosted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, earning the doubtful claim of being the first ICC member state to harbor a suspect from the court. Following the UN decision to draw down the mission by the end of 2010, representatives of UN agencies formed a working group with the Chadian government to improve security for humanitarian groups in eastern Chad. The plan includes consolidation of the Chadian Integrated Security Detachment (DIS), a component of MINURCAT consisting of Chadian police forces trained by the UN, which provide security in and around the refugee camps. However, the plans do not clearly address the security concerns of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), or the local population.

The music of Haydamaky is inspired by various ethnic music from around the world, especially from various regions of Ukraine, such as Polesia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia. Other influences include the Romanian folklore, punk music sound of Shane MacGowan and by the reggae of such bands like Burning Spear and Black Uhuru. The name refers to haidamakas, 18th century Ukrainian paramilitary and rebels.  History  The Haydamaky began their career in 1991, shortly after Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union. Then the band was known as Aktus, and played mostly local gigs in the underground Kyiv music scene. Without a fertile, popular local music scene, Aktus turned to the sounds of reggae, ska, and punk music for a fresh alternative. Members of the band were also attracted to the political impact that these genres had on their society. The idea was that through music significant social change could be possible. This gave a greater purpose to the performance of such musical styles. The discovery of these musical genres later became the key to their own realization of a specifically Ukrainian musical style. Haydamaky's hope is to forge an inherently Ukrainian popular music style, which looks back to its own heritage and traditions as a source for inspiration. With the addition of sopilka-vocalist Oleksandr Yarmola and accordionists Ivan Lenyo, both known and respected in folk circles, the band increasingly incorporated elements of Ukrainian folk music into their compositions. During the early 1990s Aktus has engaged in constant touring of Europe. Unlike most popular Ukrainian music groups who propagate Soviet style Estrada, Aktus sought to introduce elements of Ukrainian folk music through a cross-cultural mix including Reggae and Ska. EMI international records of London discovered the group in Kyiv in early 2001. Akta signed immediately to their label. At that time the band realized it was time to establish a stronger tie to their own culture. They changed their name to Haydamaky, in honor of the eighteenth-century Haydamak rebellion against the Polish szlachta. During the last years the band has participated in various festivals such as: * TFF Rudolstadt – 2003 (Germany) * \\"Litoměřický kořen\\" – 2002, 2003 (Czech Republic) * \\"Viljandi Folk\\" – 2003 (Estonia) * \\"Sziget\\" festival – 2009 in Budapest (Hungary) * \\"Pohoda\\" festival – 2001, 2002 in Trenčín * \\"Huntenpop\\" – 2008 (Netherlands) * \\"Tilburg Mundial\\" – 2007 (Netherlands) * \\"Amsterdamm Roots\\" – 2007 (Netherlands) * \\"Volt Festival\\" – 2010 (Hungary), just to name a few. Haydamaky have recently performed at many club venues across Europe, including as a special guest at a concert of Asian Dub Foundation in Bratislava, Slovakia. Other club appearances this year were held in Germany, Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Moscow. In April 2004 the band released their second album \\"Bohuslav\\". This time the group searched even deeper into Ukrainian folk music for material, ideas, and textures. The ensemble has invited violinist Vasyl Hekker, perhaps the foremost authority on authentic Ukrainian folk violin style, to collaborate on the project. Banduryst-Guitarist Jurij Fedynskyj, of New York City has relocated to Kyiv to join the ensemble. Also Ukrainian freestyle banduryst Roman Hrynkiv participated. And the band invited two young ladies from authentic Ukrainian choir \\"Bozhychi\\": Natalia Serbina and Masha Firsova, to do the back – vocals on the most of songs of the album. The \\"Bohuslav\\" promo is just on. In June Haydamaky are off on a huge concert tour, which starts by their concert in \\"Mazepa Fest\\" (Poltava, Ukraine) and will continue through the summer in Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania. In October 2006 at the WOMEX World Music Expo held in Seville Spain, Haydamaky's release of their CD entitled Ukraine Calling released by Eastblok Music earlier that year broke into the top twenty of the World Music Charts Europe. Less than a year and a half later the follow-up CD Kobzar once again on EMI/Eastblok Music, made headway on in the World Music Charts Europe when it made to seventh place in March 2008. In 2008 albom \\"Voo Voo i Haydamaky\\" recorded in collaboration with Polish veteran rock band Voo Voo gained \\"golden\\" status in Poland. Since then the group are constantly touring. In 2012 Haydamaky are recording a new album.

In doing so he had to defy Aurangzeb, a Mughal emperor. Mehrangarh museum  Early life  Durgadas was the son of Askaran Rathore, a Rajput minister of Jaswant Singh, the ruler of Marwar. He was a distant relative of the royal family, being a descendant of Karana, a son of Rao Ranmal.  Support for Ajit Singh  Jaswant Singh was campaigning in Afghanistan when he died in December 1678, leaving no heir. Aurangzeb took the opportunity to intervene by imposing Muslim rule over Marwar. This formed a part of the Mughal strategy to destroy Hinduism and his flooding of the area with troops was successful in denying any opposition. Soon after Jaswant Singh's death two of his ranis (queens) each gave birth to male children. One of these sons died soon after his birth, leaving the other – Ajit Singh – as sole heir. This news reached Aurangzeb by February 1679 but he chose not to recognise the child as the legitimate heir. He imposed jizya, a tax on non-Muslims, and soon after sold the kingdom to another chieftain, Indra Singh. Aurangzeb had moved his base from Delhi to Ajmer to oversee the subjugation but in April 1679 returned to his capital, leaving administrative and military support in Marwar for the unpopular new ruler. Prominent grandees of Marwar, including Durgadas, went to Delhi to plead the recognition of Ajit Singh as heir. Aurangzeb refused their request, although he did offer to bestow a title and a grant when the child attained the age of majority. Aurangzeb required that the child be raised in the imperial harem and that the ranis live there also. According to one contemporary source, Aurangzeb also offered to give Ajit Singh the throne of Jodhpur in the future if it was agreed that the child was raised in the Muslim faith. The attitude of Aurangzeb was not acceptable to the Rathore delegation, who resolved upon rescuing Ajit Singh and the ranis from Delhi. They were aware that many of them were likely to die in the process and this proved to be the case: as they retreated from the city on 25 June 1679 they were pursued by Mughal guards and fought several desperate and deadly rearguard actions in order to protect Durgadas, who had the ranis and child with him. The pursuit continued till the evening, when the Mughals finally tired. The infant Ajit Singh was taken to safety in Balunda, where the wife of one of the delegation kept the child for almost a year. Later, he was moved to the safety of the Aravalli Hills near Abu Sirohi, a remote town on the southern fringes of Marwar. There Ajit Singh grew up in anonymity.  Opposition to the Mughals  Aurangzeb reacted to these events by deposing the incompetent puppet ruler of Marwar, Indra Singh, and placing it under direct Mughal rule. His forces moved in to occupy the region and \\"anarchy and slaughter were let loose on the doomed state; all the great towns in the plain were pillaged; the temples were thrown down.\\" He also substituted the son of a milkman for Ajit Singh, raised the child as if he was the rightful heir to Jaswant Singh and denounced the real heir as an imposter. During the period that followed, when the Mughals controlled Marwar, Durgadas was among those who carried out a relentless struggle against the occupying forces. The capabilities of the Mughal forces were over-extended when Aurangzeb decided to attempt the over-running of Mewar also, and this provided opportunities for Rajputs of various communities, including the Rathores and the Sisodias, to use guerrilla tactics. The Rajput successes were, however, limited in Marwar: the campaign in Mewar was abandoned by the Mughals but Marwar remained in a state of war for nearly three decades. The cause of the Mughal withdrawal from Mewar had been a rebellion by a son of Aurangzeb, Akbar, who had proved to be incompetent when placed in charge of various forces in Mewar and Marwar. He eventually rebelled against his father and allied himself with the Rajputs. In June 1681 Durgadas assisted Akbar as the rebellion collapsed in disarray, aiding his flight to the court of the recently installed Maratha king Sambhaji. The rebellion diverted resources and Aurangzeb was forced to make peace in Mewar when on the cusp of winning his campaign. Durgadas was absent from Marwar during the period 1681–1687, during which time he was in the Deccan. He returned to join with the young Ajit Singh, who now came out of hiding, in taking command of Rathore forces opposing Aurangzeb. There was a change from the earlier guerrilla tactics to a more direct opposition but still they were unable to wrest control of Marwar from the Mughals, although they caused much disruption. Akbar, who was to die in exile in 1704, had left his children in the custody of the Rathores following his failed rebellion. Aurangzeb had become anxious to have them with him and negotiated with Durgadas to this end. He gained custody of his granddaughter in 1694 and of his grandson in 1698. Aurangzeb was particularly grateful to find that Durgadas had arranged for his granddaughter to be schooled in the Muslim faith but he did not restore Marwar to Rathore rule; the agreement was limited to him pardoning and giving the lesser title of jagir to Ajit Singh and appointing Durgadas as a commandant in charge of an imperial force of 3000 men in Gujarat. Despite the outcome of the negotiations, the relationship between Aurangzeb on the one hand and Ajit Singh and Durgadas on the other remained tense. They viewed each other with mutual suspicion and, in 1702, Aurangzeb ordered the governor of Gujarat to neutralise Durgadas by either arrest or murder. Durgadas became aware of this and fled to Marwar, where he tried to raise a rebel group once more. Despite his reputation and the veneration in which he was held by his countrymen, he was not particularly successful in doing so: they were tired and poorly funded after so many years of war, and the now-adult Ajit Singh had become independent of mind and jealous of the reputation and influence possessed by Durgadas. Durgadas took advantage of the disturbances following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 to seize Jodhpur and eventually evict the occupying Mughal force. Ajit Singh was proclaimed Maharaja of Jodhpur and went on to rebuild all the temples that had been desecrated by the occupying Muslims.  Death  Durgadas after completing his duties successfully and fulfilled the promise which he had given to Jaswant Singh, left Jodhpur and live in Sadri, Udaipur, Rampura, Bhanpura for some time and then left to worship Mahakaal at Ujjain. Canopy of Durgadas at Chakratirth, Ujjain On 22 November 1718, on the banks of the Shipra at Ujjain, Durgadas died at the age of 81 years, his canopy in red stone is still at the Chakratirtha, Ujjain, which is pilgrimage for all freedom fighters and Rajputs.

It has spawned a franchise of collectible card games, miniature wargames, video games, novels, comic books, and a film of the same title based on the game world. Mutant Chronicles was developed by the Swedish company Target Games as a successor of their earlier Mutant RPG series. The rights to the game are now owned by Paradox Entertainment. In 2015, Cabinet Holdings acquired Paradox Entertainment Inc. and all subsidiaries and their properties, including Mutant Chronicles.  Story  The game takes place in a distant future where the Earth has long since been depleted of natural resources and abandoned. Humanity has spread to the worlds of Venus, Mars, Mercury, Luna (the first settlement following the exodus from Earth), and the Asteroid belt. Since the exodus from Earth the traditional nation-states of the world have merged into five huge megacorporations: Bauhaus, styled after the culture of continental Europe, the American-influenced Capitol, the Japanese-themed Mishima, the British-inspired Imperial, and the ultra-secretive, ambiguous, high-tech wielding Cybertronic, all of whom use private military forces to fight for resources. Luna (the Moon) itself is considered to be neutral ground and is home to the massive city-state known as Luna City. The other major power of this universe is the Brotherhood, a fanatical religious organization formed to meet the threat of the Dark Legion, an ancient evil comprising five \\"Dark Apostles\\" and their horde of hideous mutants and undead. The Dark Legion is the corporeal presentation of the Dark Symmetry and minions of the Dark Apostles. The Dark Legion commands the most powerful armies of the solar system, including Legionnaires, resurrected corpses of fallen Megacorp heroes and footsoldiers alike; Necromutants, hideously modified humanoids; Centurions, the lethal lieutenants of the Dark Legion; and Nepharites, fearsome, towering behemoths of unimaginable power. The reign of the Dark Legion began as mankind set foot on Nero, a fictional tenth planet beyond the orbit of Pluto, where they discovered a citadel. As they entered, the Imperial Conquistadors – a group of interplanetary explorers – accidentally broke the First Seal Of Repulsion, a thin ring of salt spread around the citadel. Inside, a mysterious iron plate was found, and as it was touched, the Dark Legion was brought to our dimension, and along with it, the Dark Symmetry. The Dark Symmetry prevents computers, \\"thinking engines\\", and other electronic devices from functioning reliably, if at all, initially caused complete chaos, and then a forced adaptation of the technology used by mankind. The Dark Symmetry also begins to spread plagues, lies, illusions and war on the human population through Dark Apostles known as Demnogonis, Semai, Muawihje, Algeroth and Ilian, The Dark Mistress and most powerful wielder of The Dark Symmetry. Thus the first Corporate wars began. Only through the Brotherhood and its first Cardinal, Nathaniel Durand were the corporations pulled under one banner, driving the Dark Legion and Dark Symmetry back to the void where it came from. This however cost Nathaniel Durand his life as he fought and defeated Algeroth, the field commander of all of the Dark Legion and the master of Dark Technology. Dark Legion resurfaces as a millennium passes, old edicts to keep the evil at bay are broken and Megacorps begin the 2nd Corporate wars. Yet again Nero is explored and Dark Symmetry is unleashed. It was also during the period of 1000-year peace that Cybertronic surfaced and was the first to break one of the edicts; Humans must not create or use machines that think like man.  Editions  Target Games published the two first editions of the game (in 1993 and 1997 respectively). Mutant Chronicles was part of the first wave of foreign-language RPGs translated into English, following Metropolis' Kult (1993), and preceding Chaosium's version of Nephilim (1994). Between 2006 and 2009, a Swedish game company, COG Games, held the license rights to publish a new edition of the role-playing game. In September 2009, COG's failure to deliver any results resulted in their license being revoked. In 2013, British game company Modiphius announced that it would be releasing the official 3rd edition of the role-playing game. The core rulebook was released digitally in September 2015, preceding the hardback release in December 2015.  Spin-offs  *Doomtrooper, a collectible card game where the players commands warriors, magic and resources against their opponents. *Dark Eden, a second collectible card game designed by Bryan Winter based on the tribes remaining on planet Earth. Genesis, an expansion set, was never released. *Warzone, a miniature wargame much like Warhammer 40,000. A Warzone real-time strategy video game was in the process of being made but never published. *The Doom Troopers video game was released for the Super NES and Genesis systems. *A trilogy of three novels set in this universe were published by Penguin Books to boost the franchise and widen the perspective of the role-players. *The Siege of the Citadel board game, where players fight their way through a citadel filled with monsters from the Dark Legion. *Fury of the Clansmen and Blood Berets are two-player board games where players (or teams of players) could recreate battles between Imperial troops and the Dark Legion. *Acclaim Comics published a set of five Golgotha comics in 1996. Issue #5 was a source book with minimal info about some of the characters from the comics. Each of the comics came packaged with one of four promotional cards for the Doomtrooper CCG.

With this upgrade the new seating capacity is now at 13,500, making it the largest stadium in Division III. On October 3, 2015, a record crowd of 15,287 was recorded for a game. That mark was shattered on October 8, 2016 when the Warhawks defeated the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh 17–14 in front of a crowd of 17,535 fans. That not only broke the previous Perkins Stadium record, but also broke the NCAA Division III record for attendance. On September 23, 2017, the NCAA record was broken by a St. Thomas vs. Saint John's contest that was hosted at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The first creation came in 1461 when the soldier Sir John Wenlock was summoned to Parliament as Lord Wenlock. However, he was childless and on his death in 1471 the title became extinct. The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1831 when Sir Robert Lawley, 6th Baronet, was created Baron Wenlock, of Wenlock in the County of Shropshire. He had earlier represented Newcastle-under-Lyme in the House of Commons. However, he was not childless but on his death in 1834 the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, the seventh Baronet. He was a former Member of Parliament for Warwickshire. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baronet. In 1820 he had inherited the Escrick estate in Yorkshire from his uncle Richard Thompson and had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Thompson in lieu of Lawley. He also represented Wenlock and the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1839, twelve years before he succeeded in the baronetcy, the barony created for his elder brother was revived when he was made Baron Wenlock, of Wenlock in the County of Shropshire. His son, the second Baron, was Member of Parliament for Pontefract and served as Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire. His eldest son, the third Baron, notably served as Governor of Madras. His fourth brother, the sixth Baron (who succeeded his elder brother in 1931, who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother in 1918), served as Governor of Western Australia, of the Transvaal Republic and of Madras. His only son and heir Hon. Richard Edward Lawley died at an early age and on Lord Wenlock's death in 1932 both titles became extinct. The Lawley Baronetcy, of Spoonhill in the County of Shropshire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 16 August 1641 for Thomas Lawley, who represented Wenlock in Parliament. His son, the second Baronet, was Member of Parliament for both Wenlock and Shropshire. His eldest son, the third Baronet, also represented Wenlock in the House of Commons. The fifth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Warwickshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Wenlock in 1831. The fourth and sixth Baronets served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1743 and 1797 respectively. The seventh Baronet was High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1839.

In its original form it stands for Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. The protocol was originally developed as a memory aid for rescuers performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the most widely known use of the initialism is in the care of the unconscious or unresponsive patient, although it is also used as a reminder of the priorities for assessment and treatment of patients in many acute medical and trauma situations, from first-aid to hospital medical treatment. Airway, breathing, and circulation are all vital for life, and each is required, in that order, for the next to be effective. Since its development, the mnemonic has been extended and modified to fit the different areas in which it is used, with different versions changing the meaning of letters (such as from the original 'Circulation' to 'Compressions') or adding other letters (such as an optional \\"D\\" step for Disability or Defibrillation). In 2010, the American Heart Association and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation changed the recommended order of CPR interventions for most cases of cardiac arrest to chest compressions, airway, and breathing, or CAB. Medical use At all levels of care, the ABC protocol exists to remind the person delivering treatment of the importance of airway, breathing, and circulation to the maintenance of a patient's life. These three issues are paramount in any treatment, in that the loss (or loss of control of) any one of these items will rapidly lead to the patient's death. The three objectives are so important to successful patient care that they form the foundation of training for not only first aid providers but also participants in many advanced medical training programs. Hypoxia, the result of insufficient oxygen in the blood, is a potentially deadly condition and one of the leading causes of cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is the ultimate cause of clinical death for all animals (although with advanced intervention, such as cardiopulmonary bypass a cardiac arrest may not necessarily lead to death), and it is linked to an absence of circulation in the body, for any one of a number of reasons. For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body. Airway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's airway is blocked, breathing will not be possible, and oxygen cannot reach the lungs and be transported around the body in the blood, which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing. =CPR= The basic application of the ABC principle is in first aid, and is used in cases of unconscious patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the airway (using a technique such as \\"head tilt - chin lift\\"), then check for normal breathing. These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not. In the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started. Previously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers. Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important. However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.  Airway  = Unconscious patients = In the unconscious patient, the priority is airway management, to avoid a preventable cause of hypoxia. Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the pharynx by the tongue, a foreign body, or vomit. At a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using various techniques, with the most widely taught and used being the \\"head tilt — chin lift\\", although other methods such as the \\"modified jaw thrust\\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected, although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons. Higher level practitioners such as emergency medical service personnel may use more advanced techniques, from oropharyngeal airways to intubation, as deemed necessary. =Conscious patients= In the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and cyanosis.  Breathing  =Unconscious patients= In the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing, primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts. Normal breathing rates are between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, and if a patient is breathing below the minimum rate, then in current ILCOR basic life support protocols, CPR should be considered, although professional rescuers may have their own protocols to follow, such as artificial respiration. Rescuers are often warned against mistaking agonal breathing, which is a series of noisy gasps occurring in around 40% of cardiac arrest victims, for normal breathing. If a patient is breathing, then the rescuer will continue with the treatment indicated for an unconscious but breathing patient, which may include interventions such as the recovery position and summoning an ambulance. =Conscious or breathing patients= In a conscious patient, or where a pulse and breathing are clearly present, the care provider will initially be looking to diagnose immediately life- threatening conditions such as severe asthma, pulmonary oedema or haemothorax. Depending on skill level of the rescuer, this may involve steps such as: * Checking for general respiratory distress, such as use of accessory muscles to breathe, abdominal breathing, position of the patient, sweating, or cyanosis * Checking the respiratory rate, depth and rhythm - Normal breathing is between 12 and 20 in a healthy patient, with a regular pattern and depth. If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with Cheyne-Stokes respiration) * Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity. Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as pneumothorax or haemothorax * Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or stridor (which indicates airway obstruction) * Checking for surgical emphysema which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a pneumothorax * Auscultation and percussion of the chest by using a stethoscope to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities * Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing  Circulation  Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body. =Non- breathing patients= Circulation is the original meaning of the \\"C\\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a carotid pulse, before taking any further treatment steps. In modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating. For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation. In order to simplify the teaching of this to some groups, especially at a basic first aid level, the C for Circulation is changed for meaning CPR or Compressions. It should be remembered, however, that health care professionals will often still include a pulse check in their ABC check, and may involve additional steps such as an immediate ECG when cardiac arrest is suspected, in order to assess heart rhythm. =Breathing patients= In patients who are breathing, there is the opportunity to undertake further diagnosis and, depending on the skill level of the attending rescuer, a number of assessment options are available, including: * Observation of color and temperature of hands and fingers where cold, blue, pink, pale, or mottled extremities can be indicative of poor circulation * Capillary refill is an assessment of the effective working of the capillaries, and involves applying cutaneous pressure to an area of skin to force blood from the area, and counting the time until return of blood. This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead * Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses * Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock * Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals * Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure) * ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including myocardial infarctions  Variations  Nearly all first aid organisations use \\"ABC\\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG' (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment). =ABCD= There are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC). This may stand for different things, depending on what the trainer is trying to teach, and at what level. The D can stand for: * Defibrillation — The definitive treatment step for cardiac arrest * Disability, deformity, or Dysfunction — Disabilities or deformities caused by the injury, not pre- existing conditions * Deadly Bleeding * (Differential) Diagnosis * Decompression =ABCDE= Additionally, some protocols call for an 'E' step to patient assessment. All protocols that use 'E' steps diverge from looking after basic life support at that point, and begin looking for underlying causes. In some protocols, there can be up to 3 E's used. E can stand for: * Expose and Examine — Predominantly for ambulance-level practitioners, where it is important to remove clothing and other obstructions in order to assess wounds. * Environment — only after assessing ABCD does the responder deal with environmentally related symptoms or conditions, such as cold and lightning. * Escaping Air — Checking for air escaping, such as through a sucking chest wound, which could lead to a collapsed lung. * Elimination * Evaluate — Is the patient \\"time-critical\\" and/or does the rescuer need further assistance. =ABCDEF= An 'F' in the protocol can stand for: * Fundus — relating to pregnancy, it is a reminder for crews to check if a female is pregnant, and if she is, how far progressed she is (the position of the fundus in relation to the bellybutton gives a ready reckoning guide). * Family (in France) — indicates that rescuers must also deal with the witnesses and the family, who may be able to give precious information about the accident or the health of the patient, or may present a problem for the rescuer. * Fluids — A check for obvious fluids (blood, cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) etc.) * Fluid resuscitation * Final Steps — Consulting the nearest definitive care facility =ABCDEFG= A 'G' in the protocol can stand for * Go Quickly! — A reminder to ensure all assessments and on-scene treatments are completed with speed, in order to get the patient to hospital within the Golden Hour * Glucose — The professional rescuer may choose to perform a blood glucose test, and this can form the 'G' or alternately, the 'DEFG' can stand for \\"Don't Ever Forget Glucose\\" * Girl Check — Is also used as a reminder that all women of child-bearing age need to be tested for potential pregnancy, as this may guide treatment. =AcBC= Some trainers and protocols use an additional (small) 'c' in between the A and B, standing for 'cervical spine' or 'consider C-spine'. This is a reminder to be aware of potential neck injuries to a patient, as opening the airway may cause further damage unless a special technique is used. =CABC= The military frequently use a CABC approach, where the first C stands for \\"catastrophic haemorrhage\\". Violent trauma cases indicate that major blood loss will kill a casualty before an airway obstruction, so measures to prevent hypovolemic shock should occur first.The military's use of advanced medical techniques in emergency care on the battlefield This is often accomplished by immediately applying a tourniquet to the affected limb. =DR ABC= One of the most widely used adaptations is the addition of \\"DR\\" in front of \\"ABC\\", which stands for Danger and Response. This refers to the guiding principle in first aid to protect yourself before attempting to help others, and then ascertaining that the patient is unresponsive before attempting to treat them, using systems such as AVPU or the Glasgow Coma Score. As the original initialism was devised for in-hospital use, this was not part of the original protocol.Committee on CPR of the Division of Medical Sciences, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, JAMA 1966;198:372-379 and 138-145. In some areas, the related SR ABC is used, with the S to mean Safety. =DRsABC= A modification to DRABC is that when there is no response from the patient, the rescuer is told to send (or shout) for help and to send some signal to your location' (website no longer in operation) =DRSABCD= Incorporates the additional S for shout and D for defibrillation.Morley, J and Sprenger C (2012), First Aid Handbook, Highfield =MARCH= An expansion on CABC that accounts for the significantly increased risk of hypothermia by a patient due to hypovolemia and the body's subsequent cold weather-like reaction. *Massive Haemorrhage *Airway *Respiratory *Circulation *Head injury/Hypothermia History The 'ABC' method of remembering the correct protocol for CPR is almost as old as the procedure itself, and is an important part of the history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Throughout history, a variety of differing methods of resuscitation had been attempted and documented, although most yielded very poor outcomes. In 1957, Peter Safar wrote the book ABC of Resuscitation, which established the basis for mass training of CPR. This new concept was distributed in a 1962 training video called \\"The Pulse of Life\\" created by James Jude, Guy Knickerbocker and Peter Safar. Jude and Knickerbocker, along with William Kouwenhouen developed the method of external chest compressions, while Safar worked with James Elam to prove the effectiveness of artificial respiration. Their combined findings were presented at annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960, in Ocean City, and gained rapid and widespread acceptance over the following decade, helped by the video and speaking tour the men undertook. The ABC system for CPR training was later adopted by the American Heart Association, which promulgated standards for CPR in 1973. As of 2010, the American Heart Association chose to focus CPR on reducing interruptions to compressions, and has changed the order in its guidelines to Circulation, Airway, Breathing (CAB).

In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (–Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (–Cornouaille) and Léon. Originally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the French Revolution. It was restored by the Concordat of 1801, as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, Saint-Pol- de-Léon and Tréguier in Brittany, France. Traditionally, it formed part of Lower Brittany. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin. History =Diocese of Quimper: early history= Two versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperlé; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.Duchesne, Fasti II, p. 372. Both mention a St. Chorentius as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history. Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by St. Martin of Tours in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \\"très difficile\\".Duchesne, p. 374. External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of Saint-Guénolé (Winwaloe) (ca. 460–532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.Latouche, pp. 2-39. Charles Samaran, \\"Robert Latouche (1881-1973),\\" Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes 132 (1974), p. 393. The city of Quimper was the capital of the County of Cornouaille.Besse, p. 267. The Diocese of Quimper was represented at church councils as early as the mid- fifth century. The earliest historical reference dates from 453. An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.C. Munier, Concilia Galliae (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137. Duchesne, II, p. 247. Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-Léon Cathedral St.-Paul-Aurelian, Saint-Pol There is evidence that Christianity was preached in Léon twenty years before the evangelization of Cornouaille, but ancient Breton chronology is very uncertain. The legend of St. Paul Aurelian, written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the See of Léon had been founded in the Merovingian epoch. The hermit Saint Ronan, a native of Ireland, often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by Saint Patrick, was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around Léon. Paul Aurelian, a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of Brittany and on the Island of Batz, was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de Léon, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of Léon was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a Diocese of Léon as far back as the middle of the ninth century. Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper The cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When Alexander VI granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian. The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ex officio, and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268. There were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Trémeur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.Besse, VIII, p. 268. The abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperlé (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalaoüen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).Pouille of 1648, pp. 8-9 (436-437). Besse, pp. 270-275. Other churches The Cathedral of St. Pol de Léon, which is now in the Diocese of Quimper, was built between the 13th and 16th centuries. A list of the Bishops of Saint-Pol de Léon is given at pp. 6-11. The Church of Notre Dame de Creisker, in the same town, restored in the fourteenth century, has a belfry which the Bretons claim to be the handsomest in the world. Formerly Quimperlé had an important Benedictine abbey, Sainte Croix, founded in 1029 and where the Benedictines of St. Maur took up their residence in 1665. Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the National Constituent Assembly and by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Monastic vows were abolished. Brest, one of the great fortified harbours of France, is now in the diocese. =Diocese of Quimper: 17th and 18th centuries= In 1608 Counter-Reformation preacher Michel Le Nobletz conducted his first mission on the island of Ouessant. \\"Apostle of Brittany\\" Father Julian Maunoir worked as a missionary to the Breton people for 43 years. Albert Le Grand wrote the \\"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\\" (1636) and published a Breton dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some to be the founder of Breton philology. There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university. The Jesuits were established in the Collège de Quimper in 1620 where they flourished until the Society of Jesus was expelled from France in 1763.Besse, p. 269. Other notable persons whose origins were in the Diocese of Quimper are: the classical scholar Jean Hardouin (1646–1729), the critic Élie Catherine Fréron (1719–71), and the physician René Laennec (1781–1826), inventor of the stethoscope. In 1772, the city of Quimper contained about 10,000 persons, and in the city there were five parishes. The entire diocese contained some 180 parishes.Ritzler, VI, p. 184, note 1. Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes. =The Revolution= During the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finistère', which was made a suffragan of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English) Retrieved: 2016-09-02. The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the department. This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'. The Constituent Assembly chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Expilly was presented to King Louis XVI who ratified his election. He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.Morice et al., pp. 140-141 Expilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by Charles- Maurice de Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted Jean-Baptiste Gobel, a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March. He then proceeded to Quimper for his installation. He faced great difficulties both from the flight of many of his clergy in the face of the Terror, and from the seizure of large areas of the countryside by the Chouans, who were loyal to the monarchy. He had himself elected president of the departmental Directory, but his increasingly moderate stance brought him under suspicion from the Jacobins. He was denounced and arrested, and guillotined at Brest on 22 May 1794. His successor, Yves Audrin, was executed by the Chouans on 19/20 November 1800. In accordance with the Concordat of 1801, Pope Pius VII restored the Diocese of Quimper in 1802. The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'départmentes', did not go unnoticed. Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored. Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-Léon, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the Diocese of Vannes, and parts of the former Diocese of Dol; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.Paul Peyron, in: Société bibliographique (France) (1907), L'épiscopat français..., p. 491. Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours. When Rennes became an archbishopric in 1859, however, Quimper was assigned to that Metropolitanate, as it had been during the days of the Revolution.

It was created in 1909 from the purchase by Watford Borough Council of part of the estate of the Earls of Essex around Cassiobury House which was subsequently demolished in 1927.Lost Heritage It comprises over and extends from the A412 Rickmansworth Road in the east to the Grand Union Canal in the west, and lies to the south of the Watford suburb of Cassiobury, which was also created from the estate. The western part is a 25.1 hectare Local Nature Reserve managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. The park hosts the free, weekly timed parkrun 5km event every Saturday morning at 9am, starting at the Rickmansworth Road entrance to the park. History =14th to 19th century= Lord Essex's Cassiobury Park, by Kip and Knyff St Albans Abbey claimed rights to the manor of Cashio (then called \\"Albanestou\\"), which included Watford, dating from a grant by King Offa in AD 793. When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539, Watford was divided from Cashio and Henry assumed the lordship of the manor of Cassiobury. In 1546 he granted the manor to Sir Richard Morrison, who started building Cassiobury House with the extensive grounds (which were much larger than they are today, reaching as far as North Watford and southwards almost to Moor Park). The Tudor mansion was completed by his son, Sir Charles Morrison, and boasted 56 rooms, a long gallery, stables, a dairy and a brewhouse. A map by John Cary showing the grounds of the park in 1800 Clock surround built for Cassiobury House, c.1678 In 1627 the estate passed into the Capel family through marriage. Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, commissioned Hugh May to rebuild the Tudor house, c.1677–80,John Bold, May, Hugh, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. Retrieved 3 September 2014 with sumptuous interiors created in collaboration with the wood carver Grinling Gibbons and the painter Antonio Verrio.John Evelyn visited Cassiobury on 16 April 1680 and dedicated an insightful passage to the merits and disadvantages of the house and grounds. John Evelyn, Diary and correspondence, Vol. 2, Henry Colburn publisher, London 1850, pp. 140–141. The park and gardens were laid out by Moses Cooke who devised woodland walks and avenues, and provided \\"an excellent collection of the choicest fruits\\". Later, the gardeners George London and Charles Bridgeman also worked at Cassiobury. Between 1672 and 1720 an avenue of 296 lime trees was planted, linking the gardens to Whippendell Wood; remnants can still be seen today. A chromolithograph of Cassiobury, published around 1880 In the late eighteenth century, parts of the Grand Union Canal passing through the property were widened and landscaped on the insistence of William Capell, 4th Earl of Essex, who sat on the board of the canal company. C. 1799–1805, the 5th Earl of Essex commissioned James Wyatt to remodel the house in the Gothic style, and Humphry Repton to overhaul the park. Later, a number of lodges and other buildings were constructed by Wyatt's nephew, Jeffry Wyatville; of these, only Cassiobury Lodge in Gade Avenue survives.Cf. the contemporary image of Cassiobury Lodge on flickr. At this time the park comprised , the Home Park and the Upper Park being separated by the River Gade. The Upper Park became the West Herts Golf Course. In 1841 a fire destroyed the orangery, which was filled with newly collected plants and fine orange trees, some of which had been presented to the 6th Earl by Louis XVIII. Herds of deer roamed the park. Parties were a regular feature at the weekends. The public were allowed to ride and walk through the grounds, but had to apply for a ticket in advance. =20th century= George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex married an American heiress, helping to maintain the estate. The parties and entertainments at Cassiobury House continued into the new century: in 1902 it was visited by the young Winston Churchill and King Edward VII. But at about this time the Essex family planned to let the house and live in London. The upkeep was becoming increasingly expensive. In 1909, of parkland were sold, most to Watford Borough Council for housing and the public park. After the 7th Earl's death (1916), his widow and her son, the 8th Earl, sold up in 1922 to pay death duties, and the house was demolished for its materials in 1927. More land for the public park was purchased by Watford Borough Council in 1930. Cassiobury Park Avenue, typical suburbabia built on former parkland Construction of the residential Cassiobury Estate began. The land was made subject to restrictive covenants stipulating that only good quality detached or semi-detached houses would be allowed. Most activity was in the 1930s, though building still continues, mostly of \\"infill\\" housing on former back gardens. The park is bounded by Parkside Drive and Coningsby Drive on the north, and Cassiobury Park Avenue on the south. On Thursday 8 June 1922, at 2.30 p.m. at 20 Hanover Square, \\"By direction of the Right Honourable Adèle, Countess Dowager of Essex\\", \\"Cassiobury Park estate including the historical family mansion, Little Cassiobury, and the West Herts Golf Links, embracing in all an Area of about \\" was auctioned by Humbert & Flint, in conjunction with Knight, Frank & Rutley. Having remained unoccupied and unsold, the house itself was demolished in 1927. Only the stable block remains: this has been converted to Cassiobury Court, an old people's home, still extant in Richmond Drive. The grand staircase (said to be designed by Gibbons but since attributed to Edmund Pearce) was removed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Other materials from the house were used to restore Monmouth House in Watford High Street. Posters advertised \\"To lovers of the antique, architects, builders, etc., 300 tons of old oak: 100 very fine old oak beams and 10,000 Tudor period bricks\\". \\"English country house in New York\\" in Country Life on Tuesday, 21 July 2009, by Arabella Youens says that salvaged material from the old mansion was used to build a new Cassiobury House in the US:- ::\\"When Cassiobury House in Hertfordshire, home to the Earls of Essex for more than 250 years, was dismantled in 1927 much of the masonry was used in the construction of a new house of the same name in Bedford, New York.\\" In 1967, even the quaint, castellated entrance gates on the Rickmansworth Road were demolished to make way for a new traffic system. Little Cassiobury (Grade II* listed), the Cassiobury Estate dower house, still exists in Hempstead Road, Watford. It was sold separately from the rest of the estate. While it was in private ownership it was extended and renovated, in 1937, by the Portmeirion architect Clough Williams-Ellis. Soon after that it was compulsorily purchased by Hertfordshire County Council, who built Watford College (latterly West Herts College) on part of the site. Herts County Council used Little Cassiobury as an education office for most of the 20th century. Etymology The name \\"Caegesho\\" referred to a larger area of land granted by Offa to the Abbey of St Albans in 793. \\"Caeg\\" (Old English ') may have been a man's name, while Old English ho means \\"a spur of land\\". It was spelled \\"Caissou\\" or \\"Chaissou\\" in the 11th century and gradually evolved into \\"Cassio\\". The suffix \\"\\" occurs in many English place names. It comes from the Old English word for a fortified place, ', whose dative, byrig, means \\"by the fort\\", or \\"by the manor\\". Lay out Amateur football Much of the park is covered by mown grass and scattered trees. There are notable specimens of American oaks such as the pin oak Quercus palustris Muenchh. and the scarlet oak Q. coccinea Muenchh. The cedar of Lebanon Cedrus libani A. Richard is a prominent feature, though some of the older and unsafe specimens have been removed. Many more recent plantings of exotics have been made, such as swamp cypress Taxodium distichum (L.) Richards and various Asian rowans Sorbus spp. The park slopes generally downhill from east to west, into the alluvial valley of the River Gade. The broadly meandering river and its bridges add much charm; the canal takes a more direct route. The direction of flow is north to south. The Gade is a tributary of the Colne, which ultimately flows into the Thames at Staines. A stream near the River Gade The valley is partly wooded. Some of the woodland is rather wet and gloomy, but very beautiful; alder Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. is frequent beside the streams. Here also may be found the remains of beds and ditches for growing watercress Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum (L.) Hayek. These are largely silted up and overgrown, but the original springs are still flowing. Beyond the river and canal the ground rises quite steeply to the West Herts Golf Course, beyond which lies Whippendell Wood. The whole area is freely accessible and surprisingly unspoilt, given its proximity to London, about 20 miles away. Man-made structures in the park include a complex of paddling- pools and an adjacent miniature railway near the Gade, tennis-courts, a bowling green, a system of all-weather asphalt paths, and a number of shelters. The Watford Miniature Railway has a gauge of 10\\" and runs for 1010 yards around part of the park. Steam and Diesel locomotives are used on passenger trains. Fauna and flora The Grand Union Canal The \\"Carved Bridge\\" with the River Gade flowing under The bird-life of the formal areas is typical of parkland in southern England. Nuthatches like the old timber; spotted flycatchers the more open ground; and redwings and fieldfares the more open ground yet. Common and black-headed, and sometimes lesser black-backed and herring, gulls form loose flocks on the lower reaches towards the Gade. The canal, the river and its associated streams provide more interest for the bird-watcher. Teal (Anas crecca), water rail (Rallus aquaticus), grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) are regular visitors or resident. Especially in freezing weather, the disused cress-beds can yield waders: most often snipe (Gallinago gallinago), but also redshank (Tringa totanus) and green sandpiper (Tringa ochropus) and, more rarely, jack snipe (Lymnocryptes minimus) and dunlin (Calidris alpina). Water pipit (Anthus spinoletta) may also be found here in winter, and in January 1965, on some cress-ditches which have now been filled in, up to four spotted crakes (Porzana porzana) were present. The valley is a good place to see willow tit (Parus montanus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). The alders attract flocks of siskin (Carduelis spinus) and redpoll (C. flammea). Lesser spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) is frequent.Hertfordshire Bird Report. Some of the old ditches and surrounding woodland have been made into a local nature reserve. Marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) grows here, and there is a fairly large bed of great reed-mace (Typha latifolia). An obvious feature of the riverside flora are three species of balsams: small balsam (Impatiens parviflora), jewel-weed (I. capensis), and policeman's helmet (I. glandulifera). These are said to be escapes from the canal-wharves, where they arrived with consignments of imported timber. Filming location Cassiobury Park has been used as a filming location in a number of cinema films and television programmes due to its proximity to several major film studios such as Elstree Studios. In 1997 Whippendell Wood served as a Star Wars filming location when it provided the backdrop of a forest on the planet Naboo which featured in the scene in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, in which Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) first meet Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best).

He was most recently the manager of Brønshøj Boldklub. Biography Madsen started his career at BK Avarta in the secondary Danish 1st Division league, where he won the 1994 Danish 1st Division Revelation of the Year award. He was introduced to the top-flight Danish Superliga championship, when he was brought to newly promoted club Akademisk Boldklub (AB) in June 1996. Under manager Christian Andersen, AB finished fifth in the 1997–98 Superliga season, with Madsen on the left flank, combining well with teammate Peter Knudsen in central midfield. In June 1998, Madsen and Peter Knudsen were both brought to Italian club AS Bari in a combined transfer deal worth DKK 15 million. When they were forced to compete for the same spot in the Bari starting line-up, Peter Knudsen quickly returned to AB, while Madsen stayed three years at Bari. He started out well for the club, but was eventually benched by manager Eugenio Fascetti. Bari was relegated after the 2001 season, and as his Bari contract ran out in June 2001, Madsen left the club. He moved to German club VfL Wolfsburg on a free transfer. In the opening weeks of the German Bundesliga championship season, Madsen suffered a back injury, and struggled the remaining season to re-enter the starting line-up under manager Wolfgang Wolf without success. Following three league games for Wolfsburg, Madsen moved back to Denmark to play for Superliga club Farum BK under his former AB manager Christian Andersen in September 2002. Following one season at Farum, Madsen did not get his contract prolonged, and decided to take a job in the sales department of SAV Danmark in July 2003. After a month away from football, he started playing for amateur club HIK in the Danish 2nd Division in August 2003. He helped the club win promotion for the 1st Division, which saw the club turn professional, before he moved to league rivals Lyngby BK in November 2005. Due to an injured knee, he was forced to end his career in February 2007. Shortly after the news of his career stop, it was announced that he was to be associated with the newly founded Birkerød Sports College as a football coach, beginning in the summer of 2007. However, he chose to be new head coach at HIK. He only kept this job for a few months, because in June 2007 he was announced new sporting director at BK Fremad Amager. When his new club fired Jakob Friis-Hansen in May 2008 he became caretaker manager. After the season, he became manager of FC Amager. He had the job at Amager until March 2009, when the club went bankrupt. In June 2009 he was named the new manager of Vanløse IF. On 6 October 2011, he announced that he would not renew his contract with Vanløse, when it ended on 31 December 2011. In January 2012 he became assistant manager of Brønshøj Boldklub. He succeeded Erik Rasmussen as manager of Greve Fodbold on 1 January 2013. In January 2018 he became new manager of Akademisk Boldklub. He left in May 2019 to become manager of AB's local rivals Brønshøj Boldklub. Following a poor start to the 2020-21-season he left Brønshøj in October 2020.

He has been accompanied by some of the masters of Iranian traditional music such as Jalil Shahnaz, Hossein Alizadeh, Jalal Zolfonoun, Parviz Meshkatian and Faramarz Payvar. He has also worked with his son Hafez, a composer. Nazeri was the first musician to include Rumi's poetry within Persian music, thus establishing a tradition of Sufi music within both Persian classical music and Kurdish music. The Christian Science Monitor has called him \\"Iran's Pavarotti\\". In 2014, he performed a Kurdish song at his concert in Kermanshah titled \\"I am from Kermanshah, I don’t speak Farsi\\", prompting condemnation from Iranian authorities, and accusations of Kurdish nationalism.  Career  Shahram Nazeri has been established as a significant artist in Iran since the 1970s. His first albums which were in the form of mutual albums with Mohammad- Reza Shajarian, were published by the Chavoush institute by the end of the late 1970s. The content of these albums were filled with liberalism and patriotic ideas. Nazeri has released over forty recordings to date. His 1980s album The One Hundred-Petalled Rose (in Persian: Gol-e Sadbarg) has held the record for the highest selling album of Persian classical music and Sufi music in history. His musical talents were first nurtured by his mother at a very young age. Throughout his childhood, he was under the tutelage of the most renowned masters of Persian music including Abdollah Davami, Nourali Boroumand, and Mahmood Karimi. At eleven, he performed on the national Iranian television live for the first time. By age 29, he had gained a loyal fan base. He has continued to perform in Iran and abroad over the course of the last two decades.

She was the third and best-known actress to have portrayed the popular role. She also is known for her three roles on television's The Edge of Night and for having played Sylvia Hill Suker, R. N. on As the World Turns. Alexander originally was interested in being a concert pianist, but turned her attention to acting. She majored in theater at Northwestern University. Alexander is best remembered for playing three different characters on The Edge of Night in the 1950s and 1960s. Those characters were named, Gail Armstrong (1958–1959), a commercial artist; Laura Hathaway Hillyer (1966–1967), a socialite, married to Orin Hillyer; and lastly, her long-lost identical twin sister, Julie (Hathaway) Jamison Hubbard Hillyer (1967–1968). She later appeared as gun moll Gloria Saxon on the short-lived series, From These Roots. When The Edge of Night was casting its lead female role Sara Lane in 1956, Millette was offered the role, but declined. She did not want to commit to the role which was to be a longtime commitment. She was later to play three very diverse roles (including one of the first dual roles on daytime television) which she enjoyed. She also played on As the World Turns from 1964 to 1966 in the role of nurse, Sylvia Hill Suker. Alexander assumed the role of Dr. Sara McIntyre #3 on the serial The Guiding Light from January 1969 until January 1983, playing the adoptive mother of character T.J. Werner, a role portrayed by T.J. Hargrave (1974–1978) and later by Kevin Bacon (1980–1981), Christopher Marcantel (1981) and finally by Nigel Reed (1981–1982). Her character was married to Lee Gantry, Dr. Joe Werner, Dean Blackford and Adam Thorpe (father of infamous Roger Thorpe). The role had been created by actress Patricia Roe. Her character was written out of the storyline offscreen when Alexander left the show of her own accord. The move coincided with Alexander's wish to pursue the piano full-time professionally, with her piano duo partner Frank Daykin. The piano duo Alexander and Daykin has performed in Paris' Salle Gaveau and New York's Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall (three times) to critical acclaim. They have recorded two CDs for Connoisseur Society: Bach's \\"Die Kunst der Fuge\\" (winner of American Record Guide 10 Best New Releases of 1996), and \\"Paris Originals\\" (20th- century French masterworks for four hands). The New York Times said: \\"They make music as one.\\" And the Toronto Citizen, in a review of the Bach CD hailed them as \\"surely one of the finest piano duos in the world today.\\" Alexander's children are Adam, William, and Jennifer, and she also has several grandchildren. She was the daughter-in-law of Oscar Hammerstein II before she divorced her husband. Alexander is the founder of Chamber Music Central, a summer chamber music camp for children in Fairfield County, Connecticut.

Social Security Death Index [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2009. while teaching music at public schools in Smithtown, New York. He asked his second grade class what they wanted for Christmas, and noticed that almost all of the students had at least one front tooth missing as they answered in a lisp. Gardner wrote the song in 30 minutes. In a 1995 interview, Gardner said, \\"I was amazed at the way that silly little song was picked up by the whole country.\\"\\"Donald Yetter Gardner, 91, Songwriter\\". The New York Times.

The song was published in 1948 after an employee of Witmark music company heard Gardner sing it at a music teachers conference. The song was introduced in 1948 by singing group The Satisfiers on Perry Como's radio show,\\"Angels We Have Heard: The Christmas Song Stories\\". James Richliano. 2002. and originally recorded by Spike Jones & His City Slickers on December 6, 1947, with lead vocal by George Rock. That version (released by RCA Victor) reached the top of the pop charts in 1948, and again in 1949. The song has also been recorded by numerous other singers and performers, including Ray Stevens, George Strait, Danny Kaye with The Andrews Sisters, Urbie Green, The Platters, Dread Zeppelin, The Kelly Family, Nat King Cole (reportedly Gardner's favorite version), The Chipmunks, the Hampton String Quartet, The Three Stooges and Count von Count of Sesame Street. In the versions by Spike, The Chipmunks (Theodore on lead vocals), and Ray Stevens, the song ends with the performer shouting the words \\"Happy New Year!!!\\" Homer and Jethro parodied the song as \\"All I Want for Christmas Is My Upper Plate\\", on their 1968 album Cool Crazy Christmas. Drag performer and singer RuPaul parodied the song on his Christmas album Ho Ho Ho.

A slow ballad based on piano and guitar, it describes a heroin-addicted couple living in Dublin's Ballymun flats; the towers have since become associated with the song. Though a lot of time was dedicated to the lyrics, the music was improvised with co-producer Daniel Lanois during a recording session for the album. The group explored American music for The Joshua Tree, and as such, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" demonstrates folk rock and acoustic blues influences. The song was praised by critics, many of them calling it one of the record's best tracks. It has since been included in the regular set lists of four U2 concert tours, in two different arrangements and with several possible thematic interpretations. Background \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was written by U2 in the context of the heroin addiction epidemic in Dublin of the 1980s, much like \\"Bad\\" (and to some extent \\"Wire\\") had been from their 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire. Bassist Adam Clayton has referred to the song as \\"Bad Part II\\".McCormick (2006), p. 182 Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott's decline and death from addiction also resonated with Clayton at the time. One of the seven towers in Ballymun Flats Until their 2014 album Songs of Innocence, U2 had written relatively few songs directly related to their growing up in Dublin, often giving higher priority to works about The Troubles in Northern Ireland or to international concerns.Rafter (2001), pp. 222–223 When they have written about Dublin, allusions to it have often been disguised.Cogan (2008), p. 90 But \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was one of those with specific Dublin connections: This lyric was a reference to the Ballymun flats, a group of seven local authority, high-rise residential tower blocks built in the Ballymun neighborhood of Dublin during the 1960s. Paul Hewson (later known as U2's lead vocalist Bono) had grown up on Cedarwood Road in the adjacent Glasnevin neighborhood, in a house across fields behind the towers, near his friends and future artists Fionán Hanvey (later known as Gavin Friday) and Derek Rowan (later known as Guggi).Flanagan (1995), pp. 151, 257 Bono had played in the towers' foundations as they were being built, then traveled in their elevators for the novel experience. Over time, poor maintenance, lack of facilities for children, transient tenancies, and other factors caused social conditions and communal ties to break down in the flats. The place began to stink of urine and vomit, and glue sniffers and used needles were common sights, as were appearances of the Garda Síochána. Guggi later lived in the towers during years that he was struggling personally with drugs. It was through his exposure to people without hope in the flats that Bono began to develop his social consciousness. Bono may have used Ballymun as the inspiration (without any explicit lyrical references to it) for the 1980 U2 song \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\", and later likened living in the area to some of the scenes portrayed in the 1992 Mike Newell film Into the West. Driving by there in 1987, Bono said, \\"See the seven tall buildings there? They're 'the seven towers.' They have the highest suicide rate in Ireland. After they discovered everywhere else in the world that you don't put people living on top of each other, we built them here.\\" Writing and recording The song's title phrase originated from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going, and the brother responding, \\"It's like running to stand still.\\" Bono had not heard the phrase before, and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction and the effects of the drug on the body were like; a writer later described the title as a \\"perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction.\\" Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts, a man and a woman, who lived in the Ballymun towers. Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit, the man became a heroin smuggler, operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday. Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions, as well as poor choices, and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives. The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly, but instead limns the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in. In doing so, the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman. A character monologue from Wim Wenders' 1984 film Paris, Texas, was also a significant influence on Bono's writing of the song.Flanagan (1995), p. 352 Although the lyrics of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" were worked on a great deal, the musical composition was essentially improvised by the band during the recording process. Guitarist the Edge began playing some piano chords during a session for another song. Producer Daniel Lanois joined in on guitar, and the rest of the group followed. This initial improvised version incorporated all the elements of the final song structure, and the sound and feel of the group playing in a room together without overdubs contributed to the track's effectiveness.Hutchinson (2003), p. 76 Lou Reed's \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" and Elton John's \\"Candle in the Wind\\", both of which had served as end snippets for \\"Bad\\" on the Unforgettable Fire Tour, were loose inspirations. The influence of Reed's works can be felt throughout the song, as can Van Morrison to an extent. Indeed, in a published tribute following Reed's 2013 death, Bono offered \\"Running to Stand Still\\" as \\"red-handed proof\\" of the influence that Reed and the Velvet Underground had had upon U2. The Edge overdubbed the song's slide acoustic guitar, which was \\"amplified through a blaster\\", while working on guitar compositions in a lounge next to the main studio of Windmill Lane Studios. Lanois walked into the room and, impressed by the sound of the Edge's playing, wanted to record it on the spot rather than in the studio. Lanois brought the Edge headphones and plugged his guitar directly into the microphone input of the mixing console to record it. The producer said: \\"The blaster was amplifying his slide guitar in a lovely way. He had honed in on this sound and sort of altered the EQs and controls so that it was pleasant to him\\". Composition and interpretation Much of The Joshua Tree showed the band's fascination with American culture, politics, and musical forms, and while the lyrics of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" were Irish-based, the musical arrangement for it began with touches of acoustic blues and country blues that represented an idiomatic stretch for the group. Although producer Brian Eno was known for introducing European textural music into U2's sound, he also had a strong fondness for folk and gospel music. Indeed, writers have seen echoes of Bruce Springsteen's stark acoustic 1982 album Nebraska in the song's sound. \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is a soft, piano-based ballad played in a key of D major at a tempo of 92 beats per minute. See piano part and leadsheet, some of which are available in preview mode. The song follows a traditional verse- chorus form. In the introduction and conclusion is a mournful slide acoustic guitar in Eno and Lanois' production that Rolling Stone called both grim and dreamy. Most of the piano part alternates between the D and G chords, an example of the Edge's longtime practice of composing around two-chord progressions. The part gives the song an elegiac feel.Jobling (2014), p. 162 Accompanying the piano for much of the song is Lanois' soft playing of a so- called electric \\"scrape guitar\\", which he contributed to add texture. Soft, echoing drums from Larry Mullen, Jr., enter after the second chorus. A harmonica part from Bono takes the song to its faded conclusion. Bono's vocal range in the song runs from A3 to D6. In the song, the woman's addiction and misdirected desire for transcendence are reflected in lines such as \\"She runs through the streets / With her eyes painted red\\" and \\"She will suffer the needle chill\\". Bono's lyrics evoke helplessness and frustration in the lines \\"You've got to cry without weeping, talk without speaking, scream without raising your voice\\". The title phrase is not used until the last line of the song. This compositional technique relies upon delayed gratification and is heard in a few other popular songs, such as the Cure's \\"Just Like Heaven\\" and George Michael's \\"One More Try\\".Edwards (2006), p. 137 In the liner notes to the 20th anniversary reissue of The Joshua Tree, writer Bill Flanagan stated, \\"'Running to Stand Still' is for anyone who feels trapped in an impossible circumstance by overwhelming responsibility.\\" Uncut magazine writer Andrew Mueller noted that the theme was effective in depicting \\"the drug as another bogus escape, another fraudulent promise that there's ever any evading the truth.\\" Reception \\"Running to Stand Still\\" earned critical praise upon The Joshua Tree's release, which itself received very favourable reviews and went on to become the group's best-selling album. Rolling Stone wrote, \\"After the first few times through [it], you notice the remarkable music... It sounds like a lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when that realization hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power.\\" In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that \\"A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams.\\" The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best. The 1991 Trouser Press Record Guide, however, said that the song \\"has mood but no presence\\".Robbins (1991), p. 708 \\"Running to Stand Still\\" became a Dublin anthem of sorts, immortalizing the Ballymun towers.Graham (2004), p. 33 It has been considered by pop music writer Brent Mann as one of the more powerful songs written about drug addiction, joining the likes of Jefferson Airplane's 1967 \\"White Rabbit\\", Neil Young's 1972 \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\", Martika's 1989 \\"Toy Soldiers\\", and Third Eye Blind's 1997 \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\".Mann (2005), p. 98 Irish music writer Niall Stokes considers \\"Running to Stand Still\\" to be one of the most important songs on The Joshua Tree, not only on its own merits as a \\"mature and compelling... haunting, challenging piece of pop poetry\\", but also because its moral ambiguity and lack of condemnation of its characters presaged the chaotic direction the band would take a few years later with Achtung Baby and the Zoo TV Tour.Stokes (2005), p. 70 Rolling Stones 2003 list of \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" – which placed The Joshua Tree at 26th – said that while the album is remembered for the Edge's trademark guitar sounds and the group's spiritual quests, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" remains one of its most moving songs. This latter sentiment was echoed by the Irish Independent. Live performances Throughout its live history, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" has nearly always followed \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", matching the order in which they appear on the album. It was first played live on the Joshua Tree Tour, with the Edge playing keyboards and Bono playing guitar, usually acoustic. During the 27 May 1987 show at Rome's Stadio Flaminio – the opener of that tour's second leg, and the first in Europe – 35,000 people sang along to the song's \\"Ha la la la de day\\" refrain, bringing a side-of-stage Brian Eno to tears.McCormick (2006), p. 190 One performance of the song was captured on the 1988 filmed documentary of the tour, Rattle and Hum, but was not included on the accompanying album. A different tour performance was included on both the DVD and album Live from Paris, released in 2007. On the Lovetown Tour, during one Dublin show that was broadcast worldwide, the song segued into a verse of Ewan MacColl's classic ode to industrial bleakness, \\"Dirty Old Town\\"; this show was released in 2004 as Live from the Point Depot. During the Zoo TV Tour, the song's performance was significantly altered. In these shows, the Edge played guitar on his Fender Stratocaster with the band on the main stage, while Bono sang the song on the B-stage with a headset microphone. Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric, after which he would sing \\"Hallelujah\\" over and over while reaching up into a pillar of white light.Brothers (1999), p. 260 Writer Robyn Brothers sees the addition of the \\"Hallelujah\\" coda as indicating that while organized religion may act in the role of a sedative, a notion akin to other Zoo TV themes, the role of personal faith may still have a \\"desiring, affirming, and 'deterritorializing' force.\\" At the culmination of the \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" to \\"Running to Stand Still\\" sequence, red and yellow smoke flares ignited at either end of the stage (an idea of U2's security chief, who was a U.S. Vietnam veteran),Flanagan (1995), pp. 290, 444 as the coda segued into \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". This arrangement and performance of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was included in the 1994 concert film Zoo TV: Live from Sydney. The Edge on piano and Bono on guitar as \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is performed in 2005 on the Vertigo Tour \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was not played on the PopMart Tour or Elevation Tour, but it returned to U2 concerts on the 2005 Vertigo Tour, with the original combination of the Edge on keyboards and Bono on guitar. During most of its performance on the Vertigo Tour, it once again followed \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" and culminated with a video clip of several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights being read. (After July 2005, it was replaced in that role and in the set list by \\"Miss Sarajevo\\".) During the 19 June 2005 show on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's birthday, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" included snippets of \\"Walk On\\", a song originally written for her. Author Steve Stockman felt that in this tour's uses, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was one of the band's songs from the 1980s that had lost its original meaning and was no longer about drug- dealing in the Ballymun towers. Rather, it was now being used to develop the show's theme that a belief in faith and in human potential could overcome the bleakest and most desperate situations; in this, it fit within the Vertigo Tour's emphasis on coexistence and the ONE Campaign.Stockman (2005), pp. 238–239 This assessment agreed to by an eFestivals review, and author John Jobling has called the new interpretation an \\"anti-persecution paean\\" that was used to remove the sting of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" being used to criticize American behavior during the Iraq War.Jobling (2014), p. 305 In contrast, USA Todays veteran rock writer Edna Gundersen found the song's performance still established a \\"devastating\\" mood and the New York Daily News said that the group \\"thinned 'Running To Stand Still' to give it a new mourning\\". Two other U.S. reviewers remarked that the song was lesser known to audiences, with Variety saying its inclusion helped the band connect with the past while avoiding cliché. One tour performance of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was included on the Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago DVD, during which Bono dedicated the Hallelujah coda to members of the American and British militaries fighting overseas. The song was not performed during the U2 360° Tour, with The Vancouver Sun bemoaning the absence of this \\"stone-cold classic of the U2 canon\\". Legacy Future music video director Dave Meyers wrote a movie script to the song while a film student at Loyola Marymount University. The 2004 first-season episode \\"Running to Stand Still\\" of the U.S. television series Desperate Housewives was named after the song. It featured the Lynette Scavo character resorting to taking her children's ADD medication in order to cope with the overwhelming demands of her domestic life.Wilson (2006), p. 132 A fifth-season episode of the U.S. television series One Tree Hill, itself named after a U2 song, was called \\"Running to Stand Still\\". By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in the process of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8 billion regeneration scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan.Davenport (2008), pp. 52–53 Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which \\"Running to Stand Still\\" was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time.Connolly (2006), p. 2 But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. She thus wrote, \\"regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out.\\" In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: \\"It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying.\\" She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, \\"Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin.\\" The Ballymun area was still so associated with \\"Running to Stand Still\\" and the drug problem of the time, that local backers of the regeneration went to pains to point out the recent progress. A Bono remark that it was dangerous to walk in Ballymun at night found a good deal of publicity. A fansite listing U2-related Dublin area sights in 2004 mentioned Ballymun's connection to the song, cautioning, \\"do not go here on foot – this is a bad area\\". U2's official website noted that the area was much changed now; Bono himself said \\"he's very proud to come from the Ballymun area\\"; the fansite subsequently modified its listing and said an on-foot visit to Ballymun was warranted.

The nature of the clinch during fighting depends on the rules involved in the different sports. Muay Thai puts much emphasis on strikes from the clinch, while Judo focuses on throws. The rule common to all these forms is the allowance for the grappling necessary to form a clinch. Other combat sports like Boxing or Taekwondo only allow clinching for a short time or do not allow it at all. If clinching is disallowed, the clinching fighter will be issued a warning, or the referee will restart the fight from a distance. throwing is the primary focus in Judo. = Grappling techniques = The clinch is a powerful tool for grapplers to advance into a dominant position in ground fighting, or is used for scoring points or winning a match such as a grand amplitude throw in Amateur Wrestling or an ippon in Judo. The type of techniques employed are heavily dependent on whether or not the participants are wearing clothing heavy enough to be grabbed and used to gain leverage or unbalance them to set up throws. In competitive environments examples of such clothing would be the Judogi, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gi or the Kurtka. In competition where such clothing is being worn (almost exclusively referred to as a gi) there is a strong emphasis on grip fighting where the fighters will attempt to gain a dominant hold on the opponent's gi to unbalance and throw them. Examples of such competition would be Judo, Sambo or some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitions although in BJJ there is frequently a division for both gi and no-gi competition. In no-gi competition getting double underhooks is generally considered advantageous, as the position can be used to perform throws or takedowns. Being behind the opponent in such a position is known as getting the back, and is generally considered even more advantageous, since it is harder for the opponent to defend from that position. A typical example of a technique that can be performed from this position is the suplex. Delivering knee and elbow strikes in the clinch is an important part of Muay Thai and Lethwei training. = Hand and arm positions = While clinching, the position of a fighter's arms is vitally important. The fighter always tries to keep his arms on the inside of his opponent's, allowing him to press his elbows together building a tighter grip. The fighter attempts to always hold his hands in a \\"cupping\\" position. = Striking techniques = A multitude of striking techniques exist that can be used effectively from the clinch. Punching, elbows in the clinch, also sometimes referred to as \\"dirty boxing\\" is an important aspect of Muay Thai, Wing Chun, Lethwei and mixed martial arts. Elbows and short looping punches such as hooks and uppercuts can be used effectively from the single collar tie position. Although disallowed in many combat sports, in Lethwei, the use of headbutt is encouraged and can also be effectively used from the clinch. The short distance in the clinch nullifies kicking to some extent, but some kicks are still effective. In Wing Chun, simultaneous grabs/traps at the elbows, wrists or behind the neck often open up a strike. In Muay Thai, the double collar tie is used to control an opponent while kneeing to the head or midsection, and stomps are used in some mixed martial arts competitions to kick the feet of the opponent. = Submission techniques = There are very few submission holds that can be applied effectively from the clinch, without engaging in ground fighting. The most well known submission hold is the guillotine choke, which can be attempted from a single or double collar tie. Height is advantageous in applying the guillotine choke from the clinch, since sufficient leverage is needed. Other possible but more rare submissions from the clinch are the arm triangle, rear naked choke, and Ezekiel choke.

Koshkin imagined the T-34 tank after BT tanks tested during the Spanish Civil War proved to be under-armored and prone to catching fire. Koshkin claimed that he named the tank “T-34” because he began to imagine designs for the tank in 1934. After the Soviet Army rejected his prototype, Koshkin began privately assembling a testable prototype that he would work on in the evening, after long days designing BT tank improvements. He died from pneumonia he contracted during T-34 winter tests on September 26, 1940. Mikhail Koshkin was posthumously awarded the State Stalin Prize in 1942 and the Order of the Red Star.

The purpose of DriveSpace is to increase the amount of data the user could store on disks by transparently compressing and decompressing data on-the-fly. It is primarily intended for use with hard drives, but use for floppy disks is also supported.  Overview  In the most common usage scenario, the user would have one hard drive in the computer, with all the space allocated to one partition (usually as drive C:). The software would compress the entire partition contents into one large file in the root directory. On booting the system, the driver would allocate this large file as drive C:, enabling files to be accessed as normal. Microsoft's decision to add disk compression to MS-DOS 6.0 was influenced by the fact that the competing DR DOS had earlier started to include disk compression software since version 6.0 in 1991. Instead of developing its own product from scratch, Microsoft licensed the technology for the DoubleDisk product developed by Vertisoft and adapted it to become DoubleSpace. For instance, the loading of the driver controlling the compression/decompression (DBLSPACE.BIN) became more deeply integrated into the operating system (being loaded through the undocumented pre-load API even before the CONFIG.SYS file). Microsoft had originally sought to license the technology from Stac Electronics, which had a similar product called Stacker, but these negotiations had failed. Microsoft was later successfully sued for patent infringement by Stac Electronics for violating some of its compression patents. During the court case Stac Electronics claimed that Microsoft had refused to pay any money when it attempted to license Stacker, offering only the possibility for Stac Electronics to develop enhancement products.  Consumption and compatibility  A few computer programs, particularly games, were incompatible with DoubleSpace because they effectively bypassed the DoubleSpace driver. DoubleSpace also consumed a significant amount of conventional memory, making it difficult to run memory-intensive programs.  Bugs and data loss  Shortly after its release, reports of data loss emerged. A company called Blossom Software claimed to have found a bug that could lead to data corruption. The bug occurred when writing files to heavily fragmented disks and was demonstrated by a program called BUST.EXE. The company sold a program called DoubleCheck that could be used to check for the fragmentation condition that could lead to the error. Microsoft's position was that the error only occurred under unlikely conditions, but fixed the problem in MS-DOS 6.2. The fragmentation condition was related to the way DoubleSpace compresses individual clusters (of size, say, 8K), and fits them on the disk, occupying fewer sectors (size 512 bytes) than the fixed number required without DoubleSpace (16 sectors in this example). This created the possibility of a kind of internal fragmentation issue, where DoubleSpace would be unable to find enough consecutive sectors for storing a compressed cluster even if plenty of space was available. Other potential causes of data loss included the corruption of DoubleSpace's memory areas by other programs, DoubleSpace's memory areas were not protected, because MS-DOS ran in real mode. Microsoft attempted to remedy this in the MS-DOS 6.2 version of DoubleSpace (via a feature called DoubleGuard that would check for such corruption). The fact that the compressed contents of a compressed drive was stored in a single file implied the possibility of a user accidentally deleting all his/her data by deleting just that file. This could happen if the user inadvertently got access to the host drive, containing this file. The host drive was usually mapped to the letter H: by the compression driver. However, if the compression driver had failed to load the user might see it as drive C: Turning off the computer before DoubleSpace could finish updating its data structures could also result in data loss. This problem was compounded by Microsoft making write caching enabled by default in the SMARTDRV disk cache software that came with MS-DOS 6.0. Because of this change, after exiting an application, the MS- DOS prompt might appear before all data had been written to the disk. However, due to the lack of a controlled shutdown procedure (as found in modern operating systems), many users saw the appearance of the MS-DOS prompt as an indication that it was safe to switch off the computer, which was typically the case prior to MS-DOS 6.0. Microsoft addressed this issue in MS-DOS 6.2 where the write caching was still enabled by default, but where the cache would be flushed before allowing the command prompt to reappear. Add-ons AddStor, Inc. offered an add-on product called Double Tools for DoubleSpace. It contained a number of tools to enhance the functions of the version of DoubleSpace that came with MS-DOS 6.0. This included various diagnostic features, the ability to have compressed removable media auto-mounted as they were used, as well as support for background defragmentation of DoubleSpace compressed drives. To defragment files in the background, it was possible to let DoubleTools replace the low-level DoubleSpace driver (DBLSPACE.BIN) with one supplied by DoubleTools. Replacing the driver also enabled other enhanced functionality of the product, such as the use of 32-bit code paths when it detected an Intel 80386 or higher CPU, caching capabilities and - in addition to its supporting the use of the Upper Memory Area - also permitted the use of Extended Memory for some of its buffers (reducing the driver's total footprint in conventional and upper memory, albeit at the cost of somewhat reduced speed). Another function was the ability to split a compressed volume over multiple floppy disks, being able to see the entire volume with only the first disk inserted (and being prompted to change discs as necessary). It was also possible to share a compressed volume with a remote computer. Double Tools also had the capability to put a special utility on compressed floppy disks that made it possible to access the compressed data even on computers that didn't have DoubleSpace (or Double Tools). Vertisoft, the company who developed the DoubleDisk program that Microsoft subsequently licensed and turned into DoubleSpace, developed and sold a DoubleSpace add-on program called SpaceManager, which contained a number of usability enhancements. It also offered improved compression ratios. Other products, like later versions of Stacker from Stac Electronics, were capable of converting existing DoubleSpace compressed drives into their own format.  Later versions  DriveSpace running on Windows 3.1, Portuguese version. Left and right charts show disk usage before and after compacting, respectively. = MS-DOS 6.2 = MS-DOS 6.2 featured a new and improved version of DoubleSpace. The ability to remove DoubleSpace was added. The program SCANDISK introduced in this release was able to scan the non-compressed and compressed drives, including checks of the internal DoubleSpace structures. Security features (known as DoubleGuard) were added to prevent memory corruption from leading to data loss. The memory footprint of the DoubleSpace driver was reduced compared to the version shipped in MS-DOS 6.0. A fix was made to the fragmentation issue discussed above. = MS-DOS 6.21 = Following a successful lawsuit by Stac Electronics regarding demonstrated patent infringement, Microsoft released MS-DOS 6.21 without DoubleSpace. A court injunction also prevented any further distribution of the previous versions of MS-DOS that included DoubleSpace. = MS-DOS 6.22 = MS-DOS 6.22 contained a reimplemented version of the disk compression software, but this time released under the name DriveSpace. The software was essentially identical to the MS-DOS 6.2 version of DoubleSpace from a user point of view, and was compatible with previous versions. = DriveSpace in Windows 95 = Windows 95 had full support of DoubleSpace/DriveSpace via a native 32-bit driver for accessing the compressed drives, along with a graphical version of the software tools. MS-DOS DriveSpace users could upgrade to Windows 95 without any troubles. Furthermore, the Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 pack contained version 3 of DriveSpace. This version introduced new compression formats (HiPack and UltraPack) with different performance characteristics for even greater compression ratios along with a tool that could recompress the files on the disk using the different formats, depending on how frequently the files were used. One could upgrade from DriveSpace 2 to DriveSpace 3, but there was no downgrade path back to DriveSpace 2. One could, however, decompress a DriveSpace 3 drive. The DOS device driver of DriveSpace 3 had a memory footprint of around 150 KB because of all these new features. This caused difficulty for users rebooting into the MS-DOS mode of Windows 95 for running games, because of the reduced amount of conventional memory that was available. DriveSpace 3 also shipped with Windows 95 OSR2 but many features were disabled unless Plus! was also installed. DriveSpace could also not be used with FAT32, making it of little use on PCs with large hard drives. = DriveSpace in Windows 98 = Windows 98 shipped with DriveSpace 3 as part of the operating system. Functionality was the same as in Windows 95 with Plus!. =DriveSpace in Windows ME= Because of the removal of real mode support, FAT32 going mainstream and the decreasing popularity of DriveSpace, DriveSpace in Windows ME had only limited support. DriveSpace no longer supported hard disk compression, but still supported reading and writing compressed removable media, although the only DriveSpace operation supported beside that was deleting and reallocating compressed drives. It is possible to restore full function of DriveSpace 3 (unofficially) in Windows ME, copying the executable file from a Windows 98 installation and using it to replace the executable included with Windows ME. After that, one could compress new drives as they could do on Windows 98.  Support outside Microsoft  DMSDOS, a Linux kernel driver, was developed in the late 1990s to support both the reading and writing of DoubleSpace/DriveSpace disks. However, reading and especially writing to compressed filesystems is reliable only in specific versions of the 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2 versions of the kernel. While DR-DOS supported its own disk compression technology (originally based on SuperStor, later on Stacker), Novell DOS 7 in 1993 and higher introduced an emulation of the undocumented pre-load API in order to provide seamless support for DoubleSpace as well. Since the DR-DOS drivers were DPMS-enabled whereas the MS-DOS ones were not, this did not offer any advantages for DR-DOS users, but allowed easier coexistence or migration due to the possibility of shared use of already existing compressed volumes in multi-boot scenarios. DR-DOS 7.02 and higher also added support for DriveSpace in 1998.

Lewis. It stars Frank Lovejoy as a career Marine battalion commander who is recalled from work at an American embassy, Richard Carlson as a veteran captain and communications specialist of World War II called up from the Marine Corps Reserves, Russ Tamblyn as a seventeen-year-old private who hides his true age to serve with the unit overseas and outdo his older brother, also a Marine, and Nedrick Young (credited as Ned Young). Also appearing in the film is Peter Julien Ortiz, a highly decorated Marine who served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and appeared in various films after retiring from the military. Plot A Marine battalion is assembled from various sources and sent to Korea. The film depicts the formation and training of the battalion, the amphibious landing at the Battle of Inchon, the advance through North Korea, and the Winter Chinese Communist Offensive sends the Marines into a fighting withdrawal to the staging area at Hŭngnam Harbor \\"...with rifles, grenades, bayonets, our bare fists if we have to\\" (quoting the battalion commander). The battalion includes many familiar faces, including Karl Malden. Baby-faced Pt. McDiarmid (18 year old Russ Tamblyn) goes looking for his older brother and is shown a row of dead Marines. One of them, he discovers, is his brother. The battalion commander (Lovejoy) is supposed to send him home per a regulation covering the last survivor of a family. The Chinese Communist offensive puts this on hold for the moment, and he is nearly killed during the withdrawal in a snowstorm until saved by a joint American-British force. Upon seeing the British Royal Marines a southern-accented GI asks Corbett (Frank Lovejoy) \\"Who are they? And why are they all done up?\\"(meaning dressed up), to which Corbett (Frank Lovejoy) responds stoically, \\"They're marines! British royal marines!\\". Near the end of the film Corbett (Frank Lovejoy) tells them they're going to have to fall back in the face of human wave attacks by the communist forces, to which a private asks him \\"You mean retreat!?\\", Corbett (Lovejoy) responds by saying \\"Retreat hell!

Ortiz Production With the U.S. Marine Corps's fight for life at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir against the Chinese Communist Forces offensive in the winter of 1950 being anxiously followed in the news of the day, Warner Brothers submitted a proposal on 7 December 1950 to the Marines to make a film about the events. The Marines approved the request, with former Marine Milton Sperling producing and co- writing the film for his United States Pictures division of Warners.Suid. Guts and Glory, p. 138. The Marine Corps worked closely with Sperling on the script giving it their approval in August 1951 and agreeing to six weeks of filming at Camp Pendleton where the film crew bulldozed a road and sprinkled the area with gypsum to simulate snow. The Marines also created accurate Korean villages for the film. Commandant of the Marine Corps Lemuel Shepherd estimated the value of the Marine cooperation at US$1,000,000.Suid. Guts and Glory, p. 139. The Hollywood Production Code Office originally refused to approve the title because of its ban on the word \\"hell\\", but changed their mind after requests from the Marine Corps. The film was also intended to showcase the diverse background of the Americans. Richard Carlson was a Norwegian-American from Minnesota, and so his character was given the last name \\"Hansen\\" (the most common surname in Norway), and Nedrick Young's character is given the name \\"Sergeant Novak\\", with Novak being a name of Slovak origins and Frank Lovejoy having the Anglo name Corbett. While the film uses fictional characters, it faithfully follows the true story of the First Marine Battalion's battles at Inchon and Seoul and is therefore ranked as one of the most realistic movies ever made about the Korean War.Korean War Filmography: 91 English Language Features through 2000 By Robert J. Lentz pg. 298-300 The film also features the efforts of the U.S. Navy and Royal Marines. Director Joseph H. Lewis had been hired by Warner Brothers after the success of his film Gun Crazy but had not been given any assignment until this film. During World War II, Lewis directed US Army training films about the M1 Garand rifle that were shown well into the 1960s. Reception Variety called it a \\"top-notch war drama\\" for the way it balanced tense action with a more human face of the war, anticipating film-making trends that would become more common twenty years later.The Frozen Hours: A Novel of the Korean War By Jeff Shaara pg. 507 (Afterword) The film did fairly well at the box office, but was proportionately boosted due to the fact that the film was heavily promoted in some locales where a number of drive in theaters showed it as their only option for several consecutive months. This was the case at a series of locally owned drive in theaters in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. As a result of this in the Wisconsin counties of Polk County, Barron County, Price County, Clark County, Marinette County, Oconto County, Shawano County, Waupaca County, Dodge County and Taylor County it was the only movie one could see in a drive in for multiple consecutive months. This was also the case in the Indiana counties of Kosciusko County, Whitley County, Huntington County, Adams County, Morgan County, Jackson County and Greene County. This was also the case in Ogle County, Illinois and Bureau County, Illinois. These same theaters showed Retreat Hell! as their only feature for several months until they switched over to showing One Minute to Zero as their only option for another several months beginning in July of the same year. These same drive in theaters would only do this again on one more occasion, which would be for the movie Tarzan and the Lost Safari which was released in 1957.Movies Under the Stars: A History of the Drive-in Theatre Industry, 1933-1983 by David Bruce Reddick, University Microfilms, 1989 pp. 27-28 An oral history interview with Donald H.

The district's headquarters is the town of Barkhan. It was granted the status of a separate district on 31 December 1991, prior to which it was a tehsil within Loralai District.  History  The early history of District Barkhan is obscure, but it is said that this area remained under Muslim rulers and conquerors of Kandahar and India. Baro Khan the founder of Barozai family of Pannis was a great fighter who came to Barkhan with his tribal people after he was defeated. As such, this valley was named as Bar Khan, but with the passage of time it was called Barkhan.https://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=827&Itemid;=1113 The Khetran country was one of the sub-districts of Sewistan and of the Hind Province of Tatta. In Akbar's time it was called Janjah. Khetran is an a Baloch tribe. Mir Girazo Khan Mazarani Baloch was first sardar of the Khetrans. He was succeeded by his son Bakhtiar Khan, who was succeeded by Mir Haji Khan, whose rule is memorable among the Khetrans for a defeat which he inflicted on the Zhob Kakars. Mir Haji Khan was succeeded by a few nominal chiefs. Mir Haji Khan was a strong man, and the Khetrans prospered under him. He also took revenge on the defeat of the Khetrans from Marris by destroying the fort at Mawand of Karam Khan Bijrani Marri. Haji Khan died, leaving three sons: Umar Khan, Nawab Khan and Balu Khan. Yet he was succeeded by his brother Sayed Khan, who was elected by the Khetrans. He too died, leaving three sons: Dost Muhammad, Sorni Khan and Kadir Bakhsh. Syed Khan was succeeded by his brother Balul Khan. Babul Khan was however opposed by Nawab Khan and Kadir Bakhsh. Kadir Bakhsh went to the Marris and gave his stepmother in marriage to Gazan, the Marri Chief and led Marris Lashkar against the Khetrans, who lost many lives and property during the fights. Sir Rober Sandeman (then Deputy Commissioner, D.G. Khan), however, intervened and made peace between Kadir Bakhsh and Babul Khan. = British Raj = Due to prolonged war among Khetrans, Lunis and Marris, in 1880, the Khetrans submitted a petition to the British authorities at D.G Khan, offering to pay revenue and to be taken under British protection. The Khetrans' country remained under the political control of the British authorities of D.G Khan from 1878 to 1883. In 1883, Sardar Baloch Khan met Mr Bruce, the Political Agent of Thaal Chotiali, with a Jirga of his tribesmen. This settled the dispute between the Khetrans, Luni and Marris. In 1884, the Khetrans came under the authority of the Agent to the Governor General in Balochistan. The Leghari Barkhan circle, comprising two valleys, Barkhan and Vitakari, was transferred from Punjab control to Balochistan control in 1884. This district was brought under the direct administration of Balochistan in 1887, when work on the construction of D.G Khan - Pishin Road was started and a Tehsildar was posted at Barkhan. In 1889, Barkhan tehsil was transferred to the Zhob Agency with headquarters at Loralai. This tehsil however was transferred again to Thal Chotaili Agency in 1892. In October 1903, the Thal Chotaili and Zhob Agencies were remodeled and three new agencies were created: Sibi, Loralai and Zhob. The Barkhan Tehsil was transferred to the Loralai Agency.  Geography  Barkhan is the eighth- smallest district of Balochistan and has an area of 3,410 square kilometers. Barkhan District lies between 69°3'-70° 4' East longitude and 29°37'-30°21' North latitude, consisting of one tehsil and eight union councils. The location of Barkhan is 541 km (aerial distance) south-west (220 degrees bearing) of Pakistan's capital city Islamabad and 245 km east (97 degrees bearing) from Quetta City, the provincial capital of Balochistan. = Topography = The landscape of Barkhan consists of plains, valleys and mountains varying in ground elevation ranging from 841 to 2,031 meters above Mean Sea Level (MSL). The district consists of one main valley, called Barkhan, and several smaller valleys, which are separated from the main valley by low ranges of hills running in a southwest direction. The Barkhan valley is enclosed on the north side by scattered low hills, which divide the drainage water of the valley from the waters flowing into the Rakhni stream in the southwest, and on the west and northwest side by the great Jandran range. The valley ends in the Vitakari valley. To the east of the Sukha range is the Kharcha valley, which is bounded by the Phulai range on the east. The hills in the district belong to the Suleman range; the principal hills are known as Kala Pahar in the north, Karwada, Bibar, Jandra and Mar or Mukhmar in the west, Andari and Sukha in the south, Phulai and Khawaj in the east, and Mazara, Tagha, Dig and Deka in the centre and Rakhni areas. The ranges mostly consist of earth sand and stones; some portions are rocky and not easily accessible. The Jandran range is mostly rocky. In the south runs the Han stream with its tributaries. The Han stream runs in a southwest direction and carries the drainage of the Han pass and the southeastern slopes of the Jandran range. At Dhamani (Barkhan Tehsil) the stream becomes perennial up to its junction with the Kah River in Dera Ghazi Khan district. Dhaula stream, its tributary, brings water from the hills situated to the south of the Bagha valley and irrigates a number of villages in the Barkhan valley and joins Han in Vitakari. Rakhni and Han join Kah Stream which then passes into the district of Dera Ghazi Khan. A third important stream is Bala Dhaka. This stream lies in Berg-Sham Mauza of the Barkhan Tehsil. The stream is a tributary of the Narechi River (Duki Tehsil). Water in this stream comes down from the southwestern slopes of hills located north of the Han pass. The stream irrigates a very small area of Mauza Berg-Sham, and then its water passes in the Duki Tehsil. = Archaeological sites = During geological mapping and bio-stratigraphic research activity in Barkhan District, the geologists of the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) discovered the first dinosaur fossils in Pakistan. = Khetranisaurus = District Barkhan made headlines when million years old fossils of a dinosaurs was found in the area of Vatakari. Etymology; Khetrani, honoring the Khetran tribe of Barkhan district; saurus means reptiles. The species specific epithet barkhani, honoring the Barkhan which is the host District of dinosaurs. Khetranisaurus barkhani based on long, mid-transversely greater width than mid-ventrodorsal height and no chevron ridges (may be eroded) of anterior caudals; perpendicular ventral and lateral surfaces, a ventral groove of elongated oval/hexagonal shape bounded by wall between the chevron facets depressions, a transverse ventral median ridge formed due to chevron facets depressions and disconnected by oval groove, and a small resistant tubera is found on the ventral margin of anterior articular rim of anterior/midcaudals just on the front of oval groove; no chevron ridges, a faint ventral groove of elongated oval shape of posterior caudals; the ratio of mid-dorsal width to midventral width of mid and posterior caudals is slightly less than 1; and lateral surfaces on ventral view are not observed in mid and posterior caudals due to midventral greater width than mid-dorsal width. = Climate = Barkhan has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with very hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation mainly falls in two distinct periods: light to moderate rain in the late winter and early spring from February to April, and heavier rain in the monsoon from June to September.  Demography  The predominant language is Balochi, which accounts for % of the population. There is also a sizeable community of speakers of the Indo-Aryan language Khetrani. There are four main tribes in Barkhan District: the Khetran, Marri tribe, Hasni tribe and Buzdar tribe. The Khetrans have a chief (called Tumandar) of the tribe, while, each sub-clan/section is represented by a headman (called Wadera).  Government and politics  Barkhan started functioning as a district on 31 December 1991. Previously, it was a tehsil of district Loralai. The main motivation for granting Barkhan the status of a district was to provide basic facilities at a grassroots level and to give people easy access to public offices. District Barkhan comprises only one Tehsil, Barkhan itself. Local Government Administration Organogram (Administrative Setup)Local Government organogram of Barkhan Local government organogram (political) The Balochistan Local Government Ordinance (BLGO) of 1980 was intended to involve local populations in the development of their areas; it was replaced by BLGO 2001, which introduced the concept of district government. Under BLGO 2001, Barkhan District had one tehsil and eight union councils. The district was administered by a single line of administration that covered both the rural as well as the urban areas. The system continued for two tenures and was again modified through the approval of BLGA 2010. The present system, under the Local Government Act 2010, is similar to BLGO 1980 in that it emphasizes a rural-urban division, but no elections were held under the latest system. = District Council = District setup There are eight union councils' representatives in the District Council of Barkhan, one from each union council. Special seats are allocated to the representatives of workers/peasants, women and minorities as discussed above. All the elected chairmen of the Municipal Committees are also members of the District Council. The District Council is concerned with rural development activities and functions pertaining to, public health, education, agricultural development and economic welfare, articles of food and drink, drainage, livestock and dairy development, culture and public safety. The District Council can generate revenue by levying fees and various taxes as given in part II of second schedule of BLGA 2010. = Federal and government offices and services = Federal and Provincial Government Departments in Barkhan A number of Federal and Provincial Government departments provide services at the district level. Except for FBS, Civil Defense and Passport and immigration, all other major departments are functional at the district level, and some departments have offices even at the tehsil level. (DC office, Election Commission of Pakistan, 2010)  Education and educational institutions  According to Pakistan District Education Ranking, a report by Alif Ailaan, district Barkhan is ranked at number 100 nationally with a score of 50.24. The learning score of Barakhan is 54.58 and gender parity of 62.75. The national rank according to readiness is 100, with a readiness score of 22.66 and primary ratio of 9.7. The school infrastructure score is 20.53, ranking Barkhan district nationally at 153. Functional toilets are a major issues in schools of Barkhan with a score of 2.65. Issues reported in TaleemDo! App usually relate to poor building walls, putting students lives at risk or in some places no building walls at all. Basic facilities are missing and there are also many complaints about lack of quality teachers. In the case of rural females, only 6% had ever-attended any school and only 3% graduated from primary or higher levels. The primary net attendance ratio of school-going age children was 39%, with girls lower than boys (36% versus 41%). This indicates that 61% children were still out of school and will either join late, or probably will never enroll. The total enrollment for middle classes up to December 2009 was 1,085, and total enrollment in secondary classes was only 595. One of the major reasons for low enrollment in secondary levels is non-availability of schools. Against 572 primary schools in the district, there are only 17 middle and 14 high schools. Primary school completion is relatively better (65%). There are 572 primary schools (407 male and 165 female), 17 middle schools (12 male and 5 female), 14 high schools (12 male and 2 female), 1 girls' inter college and 1 boys' degree 4 college.

The coal deposits are not large. In some places, very minute quantities of coal were found, but the work was abandoned as there was no prospect of commercial benefits. As recently as 2001, a British oil exploration company conducted a survey and found oil reserves in Vitakari, Gadobra and some other areas.

A study among Danish kids from 11 to 18 years showed that 90% knew who he was and his fan club has almost 1000 members. In Denmark, a country of only about five and a half million inhabitants, that is a very significant size for a fanclub. Jürgensen is mostly a writer for the youth but as he has said himself some of his books should be considered to be for adults. He has written in almost any genre but his most preferred genres are fantasy, science fiction and horror or a combination of those three. But he has also written crime-books, books about love and realistic novels. Humor is an ongoing feature, a thing he focuses a lot on. One of his idols, Stephen King, once said his biggest wish was that someone would die of terror after reading his book. To that Jürgensen has remarked that his biggest wish is that someone will laugh so hard from reading his book that people in the bus will turn around and look at him. He grew up in Brønshøj near Copenhagen (today he's living in Rødovre), he was doing okay in school with the exception being Danish. He drifted around after taking his exam in 1978 and tried unsuccessfully to send manuscripts to various publishers. But during the summer of 1981 Kristian Tellerup from the publishing company Tellerup answered to one of his scripts, Love at First Hiccup, a youth-novel about love and of course a lot humor. It was published the same autumn and was an enormous success and has since been reprinted 20 times. It was later put to the screen in 1999 and became a big success in Denmark. Since then he has written more than 50 novels and made three feature films, for example an adaptation of his Kærlighed ved første hik, starring Robert Hansen and Sofie Lassen-Kahlke. Dennis Jürgensen is quite shy of the media and doesn't often appear on TV, radio etc. However, on 22 August 2014 he was guest on the radio programme Syvkabalen on national radio Radio24Syv, where he openly elaborated on his work as an author and motivations.http://arkiv.radio24syv.dk/video/10178758/syvkabalen- uge-34-2014-1http://arkiv.radio24syv.dk/video/10178925/syvkabalen- uge-34-2014-2  Bibliography  These are the Danish titles of the books that have been printed. *Kærlighed ved første hik (1981) *Er du blød mand (1982) *Balladen om den forsvundne mumie (1982) *Brædder til Draculas kiste (1983) *Djævelens hule (1983) *Bøvsedragens hemmelighed (1984) *Jord i hovedet (1984) *Grønne øjne (1985) *Blodspor i Transsylvanien (1986) *Flyskræk (1986) *Gargoylens gåde (1986) *Stormesteren (1987) *Bøvl med bandagerne (1988) *Knusumkranium (Krøniker fra kvæhl 1) (1988) *Vampyrtroldene (Krøniker fra kvæhl 2) (1988) *Æzurvin slår til (Krøniker fra kvæhl 3) (1988) *Midnatstimen (1989) *Dystopia (1989) *Heksens ansigt (Krøniker fra kvæhl 4) (1990) *Lusingandos fælde (Krøniker fra kvæhl 5) (1990) *Jeg, en nørd (1990) *Snevampyren (1991) *Sorte Ragn rider igen (1991) *Kadavermarch (1991) *Tingen i cellen (1992) *Mirakler udføres (1992) *Benny og Brian med ketchup og sennep (1993) *Monstret i kælderen (1993) *Relief (1993) *Måske (1994) *Ikke en fjer bedre (1995) *Sidste time (1995) *Mørkeleg (1996) *Benny og Brian møder den sorte julemand (1996) *De hængte mænds hus (1997) *Et grimm’t eventyr (1997) *Uhyret i brønden (1998) *Gylperen (1999) *Hår(d) (1999) *Maskiner sanser ikke hud (Machines don't Sense Skin) (2000) *De kom fra blodsumpen 2 (with Patrick Leis) (They Came from the Blood Swamp 2) (2001) *Evighedens port (Drømmetjenerne 1) (Gate of Eternity, The Dream Waiters 1) (2002) *Mandators Kappe (Drømmetjenerne 2) (The Cape of Mandators, The Dream Waiters 2) (2004) *Ondskabens Dimension (Drømmetjenerne 3) (The Dimension of Evil, The Dream Waiters 3) (2005) *Den Gyldne By (Drømmetjenerne 4) (The Golden City, The Dream Waiters 4) (2006) *Kadaverjagt (Hunting Corpses) (2006) *Sagen om de japanske dræbergardiner (Spøgelseslinien 1) (The case of the Japanese Killer Curtains, Ghost Hotline 1) (2003) *Sagen om det blodige vampyrtrick (Spøgelseslinien 2) (The case of the Bloody Vampire Trick, Ghost Hotline 2) (2004) *Sagen om Ugledrengens afklippede klo (Spøgelseslinien 3) (The case of the Owl Boy's Cut Off Hook, Ghost Hotline 3) (2007) *Dæmonen i hælene (Daemon by the Heels) (2007) *Sagen om det galoperende maleri (Spøgelseslinien 4) (The case of the Galloping Painting, Ghost Hotline 4) (2008) *Sagen om den brændende klovn (Spøgelseslinien 5) (The case of the Burning Clown, Ghost Hotline 5) (2008) *Tunnelmanden (The Tunnel Man) (2010) *Kælderkrigerne (The Cellar Warriors) (2010) *Løbende Tjener (Running Waiter) (2014) Books about Dennis Jürgensen *Drager, damer & dæmoner - en guide til Dennis Jürgensens univers, M.

The ship, originally ordered in 1913 by the Russian navy under the name Maraviev Amurskyy, was launched in April 1914 at the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland). However, due to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the incomplete ship was confiscated by Germany and renamed SMS Pillau for the East Prussian port of Pillau (now Baltiysk, Russia). The Pillau was commissioned into the German Navy in December 1914. She was armed with a main battery of eight 15 cm SK L/45 (5.9-inch) guns and had a top speed of . One sister ship was built, . Pillau spent the majority of her career in II Scouting Group, and saw service in both the Baltic and North Seas. In August 1915, she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga against the Russian Navy, and on 31 May - 1 June 1916, she saw significant action at the Battle of Jutland. She was hit by a large-caliber shell once in the engagement, but suffered only moderate damage. She assisted the badly damaged battlecruiser reach port on 2 June after the conclusion of the battle. She also took part in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, though was not damaged in the engagement. Pillau was assigned to the planned, final operation of the High Seas Fleet in the closing weeks of the war, but a large scale mutiny forced it to be canceled. After the end of the war, Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war prize in 1920. Renamed Bari, she was commissioned in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in January 1924. She was modified and rebuilt several times over the next two decades. In the early years of World War II, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in several engagements in the Mediterranean. In 1943, she was slated to become an anti-aircraft defense ship, but while awaiting conversion, she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944, and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948. Design Pillau was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two propellers. They were designed to give . These were powered by six coal-fired Yarrow water-tube boilers, and four oil-fired Yarrow boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of .

The ship was armed with eight SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were side by side aft. She also carried four SK L/55 anti-aircraft guns, though these were replaced with a pair of two SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes mounted on the deck. She could also carry 120 mines. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to thick armor plate. Service history Pillau was ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy from the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig. She was laid down in 1913, and was launched on 11 April 1914, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was requisitioned by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and renamed Pillau. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 December 1914. Following her commissioning, Pillau was assigned to II Scouting Group. Her first major operation was the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. A significant detachment from the High Seas Fleet, including eight dreadnoughts and three battlecruisers, went into the Baltic to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces. On 13 August, Russian submarines fired three torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed. Pillau participated in the second attack on 16 August, led by the dreadnoughts and . The minesweepers cleared the Russian minefields by the 20th, allowing the German squadron to enter the Gulf. The Russians had by this time withdrawn to Moon Sound, and the threat of Russian submarines and mines in the Gulf prompted the Germans to retreat. The major units of the High Seas Fleet were back in the North Sea before the end of August. =Battle of Jutland= Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 30–31 May 1916 In May 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, planned to lure a portion of the British fleet away from its bases and destroy it with the entire High Seas Fleet. Pillau remained in II Scouting Group, attached to I Scouting Group, for the operation. The squadron left the Jade roadstead at 02:00 on 31 May, bound for the waters of the Skagerrak. The main body of the fleet followed an hour and a half later. Shortly before 15:30, the opposing cruiser screens engaged; was the first German cruiser to encounter the British. Pillau and steamed to assist, and at 16:12 they began firing on and at a range of . As the British ships turned away, the German shells fell short, and at 16:17, Pillau and Frankfurt checked their fire. About fifteen minutes later, the three cruisers engaged a seaplane launched by the seaplane tender . They failed to score any hits, but the aircraft was forced off after which its engine broke down and it was forced to land. The three cruisers then returned to their stations ahead of the German battlecruisers. Shortly before 17:00, the British 5th Battle Squadron had arrived on the scene, and at 16:50 they spotted Pillau, Elbing, and Frankfurt. Eight minutes later, the powerful battleships and opened fire at Pillau at a range of . Several salvos fell close to the German cruisers, prompting them to lay a cloud of smoke and turn away at high speed. About an hour later, the German battlecruisers were attacked by the destroyers and , but Pillau, Frankfurt, and the battlecruisers' secondary guns drove them off. At around 18:30, Pillau and the rest of II Scouting Group encountered the cruiser ; they opened fire and scored several hits on the ship. As both sides' cruisers disengaged, Rear Admiral Horace Hood's three battlecruisers intervened. His flagship scored a hit on Wiesbaden that exploded in her engine room and disabled the ship. Pillau was also hit by a shell from . The shell exploded below the ship's chart house; most of the blast went overboard, but the starboard air supply shaft vented part of the explosion into the second boiler room. All six of the ship's coal-fired boilers were temporarily disabled, though she could still make on her four oil-fired boilers, allowing her to escape under cover of heavy fog. By 20:30, three of the six boilers were back in operation, allowing her to steam at . At around 21:20, II Scouting Group again encountered the British battlecruisers. As they turned away, Pillau briefly came under fire from the battlecruisers, though to no effect. and both fired salvos at the ship before turning their attention to the battlecruiser ; Pillaus official record states that the British shooting was very inaccurate. Pillau and Frankfurt spotted the cruiser and several destroyers shortly before 23:00. They each fired a torpedo at the British cruiser before turning back toward the German line without using their searchlights or guns to avoid drawing the British toward the German battleships. By 04:00 on 1 June, the German fleet had evaded the British fleet and reached Horns Reef. At 09:30, Pillau was detached from the fleet to assist the crippled battlecruiser , which was having trouble navigating back to port. Pillau steamed ahead of Seydlitz to guide her back to Wilhelmshaven, but shortly after 10:00, the battlecruiser ran aground off Sylt. After freeing Seydlitz at 10:30, the voyage back resumed, with a division of minesweepers steaming ahead testing the depth to prevent another grounding. Seydlitz continued to take on water and sink lower in the water; she turned around and steamed in reverse in an attempt to improve the situation. Pillau also attempted to tow the battlecruiser, but was unable because the line repeatedly snapped. A pair of pumping steamers arrived in the evening, and slow progress was made through the night, with Pillau still guiding the voyage. The ships reached the outer Jade lightship at 08:30 and anchored twenty minutes later. In the course of the engagement, Pillau had fired 113 rounds of 15 cm ammunition and four 8.8 cm shells. She also launched one torpedo. Her crew suffered four men killed and twenty-three wounded. =Later service= In July 1917, a series of mutinies occurred on several ships of the fleet, including Pillau. While the ship was in harbor in Wilhelmshaven on the 20th, a group of 137 men left the ship to protest a cancellation of their leave. After a couple of hours in the town, the men returned to the ship and began to complete the tasks they had been ordered to do that morning as a show of good will. Pillaus commander did not take the event seriously, and ordered a limited punishment for the crewmen who had staged the protest. By late 1917, Pillau had been assigned to IV Scouting Group, along with and . In late October 1917, IV Scouting Group steamed to Pillau, arriving on the 30th. They were tasked with replacing the heavy units of the fleet that had just completed Operation Albion, the conquest of the islands in the Gulf of Riga, along with the battleships of the I Battle Squadron. The risk of mines that had come loose in a recent storm, however, prompted the naval command to cancel the mission, and Pillau and the rest of IV Scouting Group was ordered to return to the North Sea on 31 October. Upon returning the North Sea, Pillau returned to II Scouting Group. On 17 November, the four cruisers of II Scouting Group, supported by the battleships and , covered a minesweeping operation in the North Sea. They were attacked by British cruisers, supported by battlecruisers and battleships, in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. , II Scouting Group flagship, was damaged in the engagement, but the four cruisers managed to pull away from the British, drawing them toward the German dreadnoughts. They in turn forced the British to break off the attack; neither side had significant success in the operation. Pillau emerged from the battle unscathed. On 23-24 April 1918, the ship participated in an abortive fleet operation to attack British convoys to Norway. I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group, along with the Second Torpedo-Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway, with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support. The Germans failed to locate the convoy, which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port. As a result, Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port. In October 1918, Pillau and the rest of II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy. Pillau, , , and Königsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while Karlsruhe, Nürnberg, and were to bombard targets in Flanders, to draw out the British Grand Fleet. Admirals Scheer and Franz von Hipper intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. =Italian service= Ex-Pillau as the Italian Bari in Venice between the wars. Pillau briefly served in the newly reorganized Reichsmarine following the end of the war. She was stricken on 5 November 1919 and surrendered to the Allies in the French port of Cherbourg on 20 July 1920. She was ceded to Italy as a war prize under the name \\"U\\". She was renamed Bari and commissioned into the Regia Marina on 21 January 1924, initially classed as a scout. The 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced with /40 guns. In August 1925, Bari ran aground off Palermo, Sicily; she was refloated on 20 September. On 19 July 1929, Bari was reclassified as a cruiser. Bari joined the other two ex-German cruisers, and and the ex-German destroyer as the Scout Division of the 1st Squadron, based in La Spezia. Bari was modified slightly in the early 1930s, with a temporary extension to the bridge and her forward funnel was shortened to match the others. In 1933–1934, she was refitted for colonial service and converted to oil-firing. The six coal-fired boilers were removed to allow for additional oil bunker space, and the forward funnel was removed and the remaining two were cut down. This reduced her power to and a top speed of . Her cruising range was increased considerably, from at to at that speed. Since the boilers that ventilated into the forward funnel were removed, the funnel was also removed. After returning to service in September, Bari was sent on a deployment to the Red Sea, based in Italian East Africa. She remained there until May 1938, when she was relieved by the new sloop , allowing her to return to Italy. During her deployment to the Red Sea, she was joined by Taranto in 1935. World War II By the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, her armament had been increased by six guns and six machine guns. She was activated for combat duty in 1940, when she became the flagship of the Forza Navale Speciale (Special Naval Force) during the Greco- Italian War. She supported the invasion of the island of Cephalonia and later shelled Greek positions in mainland Greece. Following the German intervention in April 1941 and Greece's defeat, Bari was tasked with escorting convoys from Italy to occupied Greek ports. In the meantime, Italy had entered the wider World War in June 1940. In 1942, Italy planned to invade the island of Malta, and Bari and Taranto were to lead the landing force, but the operation was called off. In November that year, she served as the flagship of the amphibious force that landed at Bastia in Corsica. She took part in anti- partisan bombardments off the Montenegrin coast later that year. That year, she was based in Livorno, where she was placed in reserve in January 1943. In early 1943, she was slated for conversion to an anti-aircraft ship. She was to be rearmed with six /50 guns, eight guns, and eight new model 20 mm /65 or /70 machine guns. The work would have required significant resources, and work had not yet begun by 28 June, when American bombers badly damaged Bari at Livorno and she sank in shallow water two days later. At the Italian armistice in September 1943, she was further damaged to render her useless to the German occupiers. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944. She was officially removed from the navy list on 27 February 1947, and raised on 13 January 1948 for scrapping.

Plot John Davidson, a convicted thief in Dartmoor prison (played by an uncredited Cyril Delevanti) hides the location of stolen Bank of England printing plates inside three music boxes (each of which plays a subtly different version of \\"The Swagman\\"). The boxes are sold at a local auction house. When Dr Watson's friend Julian 'Stinky' Emery, an avid collector, pays Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson a visit and tells them about a strange robbery in his house the previous night, in which someone stole a music box, similar to the one that he had bought at the auction house for a measly two pounds. Later that night, Stink is murdered and the other music box is stolen, and Holmes and Watson realize that someone is willing to kill to obtain the three music boxes. When Holmes and Watson go to the house of the people who bought the second music box, they find it stolen as well. Sherlock Holmes is able to buy the third music box, and ask Scotland Yard to track down the suspects. Later it is found out that the Inspector who had been tracking the suspects has been murdered. Holmes and Watson soon crack the code of the music box and discovered the numbers on the keys correlates to a letter in the alphabet, unfortunately they are only partial able to de code the whole message because the suspects have the other two music boxes. When Holmes he discovers his flat has been ransacked in a attempt to find the third music box, he notice a cigarette with a distinct type of tobacco. Holmes tracks down the lady (Hilda Courtney) who bought the tobacco and confronts her. While Holmes is confronting her he is ambushed and tied up and led to a warehouse. Back at Holmes and Watson flat Hilda Courtney steals the music box from Dr. Watson. Holmes escapes from the warehouse nearly escaping death and returns to the flat where Watson tell Holmes that the music box has been stolen. While talking to Holmes, Watson cracks the code for the location of the five pound engraving plate, when he tells Holmes about a quote from Dr. Samual Johnson. Hilda Courtney and her gang decipher the code leading them to go to the house of Dr. Samuel Johnson. While Courtney is stealing the plates, hidden in a book shelf Holmes ambushes them and Scotland Yard arrest Courtney and her constituents before they can get away and returns the plates back to the Bank of England.

(May 16, 1931 – December 8, 2005) was a Pulitzer Prize winning American composer.  Biography  Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, Martino began as a clarinettist, playing jazz for fun and profit. He attended Syracuse University, where he studied composition with Ernst Bacon, who encouraged him in that direction. He then attended Princeton University as a graduate student, where he worked with composers Roger Sessions and Milton Babbitt. He also studied with Luigi Dallapiccola in Italy as a Fulbright Scholar.Villamil, p. 270 He became a lecturer and teacher himself, working with students at Yale University, the New England Conservatory of Music (where he became chair of the composition department), Brandeis University, and Harvard University. He won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1974 for his chamber work Notturno. In 1991, the journal Perspectives of New Music published a 292-page tribute to Martino.http://www.perspectivesofnewmusic.org/v29n2l4.htm Martino died in Antigua in 2005. A memorial concert was held at the New England Conservatory on May 8, 2007. A recording of the concert was released by Navona Records in 2009.  Music  Most of Martino's mature works (including pseudo-tonal works such as Paradiso Choruses and Seven Pious Pieces) were composed using the twelve-tone method; his sound world more closely resembled the lyrical Dallapiccola's than his other teachers'. The pianist Easley Blackwood commissioned Martino's sonata Pianississimo, explicitly requesting that it be one of the most difficult pieces ever written. The resulting work is indeed of epic difficulty, but has been recorded several times. (Blackwood declined to perform it.) Martino presented Milton Babbitt with at least two musical birthday cards: B,a,b,b,i,t,t on his 50th birthday and Triple Concerto on his 60th.  Musical compositions  Many of the instrumental pieces have extensive doublings, such as flute/piccolo/alto flute.

It is closely related to B. pseudomallei, and by multilocus sequence typing it is a subspecies of B. pseudomallei. B. mallei evolved from B. pseudomallei by selective reduction and deletions from the B. pseudomallei genome. Unlike B. pseudomallei and other genus members, B. mallei is nonmotile; its shape is coccobacillary measuring some 1.5-3.0 μm in length and 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter with rounded ends. Discovery and early history Wilhelm Schütz and Friedrich Löffler first isolated B. mallei in 1882. It was isolated from an infected liver and spleen of a horse. This bacterium is also one of the first to be identified containing a type VI secretion system which is important for its pathogenicity. In 1885, the German Botanist and Bacteriologist, Wilhelm Zopf (1846-1909) gave the pathogen its binomial name, after analyzing samples of the bacterium. He further refined his observations with the pathogen in 1886. Family Burkholderiaceae Most organisms within the Burkholderiaceae live in soil; however, B. mallei does not. Because B. mallei is an obligate mammalian pathogen, it must infect a host mammal to live and to be transmitted from one host to another. =Genus Burkholderia= B. mallei is very closely related to B. pseudomallei, being 99% identical in conserved genes when compared to B. pseudomallei. B. malllei has about 1.4 Mb less DNA than B. pseudomallei. B. mallei may have actually evolved from a strain of B. pseudomallei after the latter had infected an animal. The bacterium would have lost the genes that were not necessary for living in an animal host. This suggestion has found support from studies that compare strains of B. mallei to B. pseudomallei and indicate that their two respective genomes are very similar. The genes that allowed the bacterium to survive in a soil environment, like genes that gave B. mallei the capacity to protect against bactericidals, antibiotics, and antifungals, were likely deleted. Thus, the reason that B. mallei is not found outside of a host is because it lacks the genes necessary for survival in the soil. Genome comparisons also seem to indicate that the B. mallei is still evolving and adapting to an intracellular lifestyle. Genome The genome of B. mallei was sequenced in the United States by The Institute of Genomic Research. The size of the genome is smaller than that of B. pseudomallei. The B. mallei sequence revealed a chromosome of 3.5 mega base pairs (Mb) and a 2.3 Mb \\"megaplasmid”. Many insertion sequences and phase-variable genes were also found. The genome for B. mallei is made up of two circular chromosomes. Chromosome 1 is where genes relating to metabolism, capsule formation, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis are located. B. mallei has a polysaccharide capsule which indicates its potential as a pathogen. Chromosome 2 is where most of the information regarding secretion systems and virulence-associated genes are located. Multilocus sequence typing has revealed that B. mallei most likely evolved from a B. pseudomallei clone reduction. About 1000 B. pseudomellei genes are absent or varying in the B. mallei genome. B. mallei’s genome also has a large amount of insertion sequences. Taxonomy B. mallei was first called \\"Bacillus mallei\\" and was in the genus Pseudomonas until the early 1990s. It has also been referred to as \\"farcy\\". It is now part of the genus Burkholderia. Typing No standardised system exists for differentiating between B. mallei and B. pseudomallei. The methods that have been used to differentiate and identify one strain from the other include ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, and multilocus sequence typing. Comparing the DNA of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei must be done at the 23S rDNA level, however, since no identifiable difference is found between the two species at the 16S rDNA level. Growth in culture Both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei can be cultured in a laboratory; nutrient agar can be used to grow the bacteria. When grown in culture, B. mallei grows in smooth, grey, translucent colonies. In a period of 18 hours at 37 °C, a B. mallei colony can grow to about 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter. B. mallei culture growth on MacConkey agar is variable. Many microbiologists are unfamiliar with B. mallei and as a result it has frequently been misidentified as a Pseudomonas species or as a contaminant in a culture. Antibiotic resistance and susceptibility The bacterium is susceptible to numerous disinfectants including benzalkonium chloride, iodine, mercuric chloride, potassium permanganate, 1% sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol. The micro-organism can also be destroyed by heating or ultraviolet light. Antibiotics such as streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline, doxycycline, carbapenems, ceftazidime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole have been reported to be effective against the bacteria in vitro. B. mallei, like B. pseudomallei, is also resistant to a number of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and beta-lactams. No vaccine is currently available for humans or animals to protect against B. mallei infection. An animal model that will predict immune responses necessary to create immunity to the bacterium is needed before a vaccine can be developed. Mice are fairly close to humans in their susceptibility to B. mallei and would be the ideal choice of animal for creating a model for the vaccine. Pathogenicity B. mallei is responsible for causing glanders disease, which historically mostly affected animals, such as horses, mules, and donkeys, and rarely humans. Horses are considered the natural host for B. mallei infection and are highly susceptible to it. B. mallei infects and gains access to the cell of its host through lysis of the entry vacuole. B. mallei has bacterial protein-dependent, actin-based motility once inside the cell. It is also able to initiate host cell fusion that results in multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). The consequence of MNGCs has yet to be determined, but it may allow the bacteria to spread to different cells, evade responses by the infected host’s immune system, or allow the bacteria to remain in the host longer. B. mallei is able to survive inside host cells through its capabilities in disrupting the bacteria-killing functions of the cell. It leaves the vacuoles early, which allows for efficient replication of the bacteria inside the cell. Leaving the cell early also keeps the bacteria from being destroyed by lysosomal defensins and other pathogen-killing agents. MNGCs may help protect the bacteria from immune responses. B. mallei’s ability to live within the host cell makes developing a vaccine against it difficult and complex. The vaccine would need to create a cell-mediated immune response, as well as a humoral response to the bacteria in to be effective in protecting against B. mallei. In regards to a vaccine against B. mallei, the closeness of B. mallei to B. pseudomallei may make it possible that a vaccine developed for either type would be effective against the other. =Symptoms of B. mallei infection= Horses chronically infected with B. mallei with glanders disease typically experience mucus-containing nasal discharge, lung lesions, and nodules around the liver or spleen. Acute infection in horses results in a high fever, loss of fat or muscle, erosion of the surface of the nasal septum, hemorrhaging or mucus discharge. The bacterium mostly affects the lungs and airways. Human infection with B. mallei is rare, although it occasionally occurs among laboratory workers dealing with the bacteria or those who are frequently near infected animals. The bacteria usually infect a person through their eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts in the skin. Once people are infected, they develop a fever and rigors. Eventually, they get pneumonia, pustules, and abscesses, which prove fatal within a week to 10 days if left untreated by antibiotics. The way someone is infected by the bacteria also affects the type of symptoms that will result. If the bacteria enter through the skin, a local skin infection can result, while inhaling B. mallei can cause septicemic or pulmonary, muscular, hepatic, or splenous infections. B. mallei infection has a fatality rate of 95% if left untreated, and a 50% fatality rate in individuals treated with antibiotics. =Cellular response to infection= In the first days of B. mallei infection, neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells go to the spleen in great quantities. The early cellular response to B. mallei infection involves Gr-1+ (antigen) cells, and implies their importance to immunity against this bacterial infection. T cells (nitric oxide) are actually more involved in combating B. mallei in the later stages of its infection of a host. Lipopolysaccharide isolated from B. mallei demonstrated significantly lower biological activity as compared to the LPS from Escherichia coli, in agreement with the lower degree of acylation of its lipid A: the major forms of B. mallei lipid A were penta- and tetraacylated, whereas classical lipid A from E. coli was hexaacylated. In addition, lipid A from B. mallei contains 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinose residue in almost half of the molecules, which would partially neutralize the negative charge of the phosphate groups necessary for the interaction with the positively charged amino acids of TLR4. At the same time, lipid A acyl chains in B. mallei were on the average longer (14–16 carbon atoms) than those in E. coli (14 carbon atoms), yet LPS from B. mallei appeared to be a weaker activator. B. mallei may employ LPS with low biological activity to evade proper recognition by the TLR4/MD-2 complex of innate immune system, dampening the host immune response and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination. Global presence B. mallei has been eradicated in the United States and most Western countries, but still affects animals in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central America, and South America. Many Western countries were able to eliminate the disease through glanders control programs and laws requiring notification of cases of infection to health departments and the destruction of any animal affected with B. mallei. Potential as a biological weapon B. mallei and B. pseudomallei have a history of being on a list of potential biological warfare agents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies B. mallei as a category B critical biological agent. As a result, research regarding B. mallei may only be done in biosafety level 3 facilities in the US and internationally. Though it is so highly infective and a potential biological weapon, little research has been conducted on this bacterium. B. mallei and B. pseudomallei under the policy of Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern would be subject to oversight to ensure the responsible investigation of these agents. Incidence in the United States In March 2000, one of the first cases since the 1940s of glanders in the United States occurred in a young microbiologist working for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. The researcher had type 1 diabetes and had been working with B. mallei for about two years, but he did not always wear gloves while conducting his research. The researcher experienced enlargement of the lymph nodes and a fever which lasted for 10 days even with antibiotic treatment. In the following weeks, the researcher experienced fatigue, rigors, night sweats, and loss of weight. The next month, his symptoms seemed to disappear after treatment with clarithromycin, but after the medication was stopped, the symptoms reappeared. After conducting multiple tests on cultures from the researcher’s blood and a biopsied portion of a liver abscess, the bacterium was identified as B. mallei. Once it was established what infected the researcher, another course of antibiotics was given (imipenem and doxycycline) with 6 months of treatment. After a year, the researcher made a full recovery. This incident also showed how a cut or skin abrasion is not absolutely necessary to contract the disease, as the researcher had no recollection of any cut or accident while working in the laboratory. The case was significant as it showed the difficulty that microbiology laboratories have in identifying bioweapon agents and the potential consequences if measures are not taken to prepare for an actual biological attack. History as a weapon of biological warfare B. mallei was intentionally used to infect animals and humans during World War I. The Germans used B. mallei to infect animals that were being sent from neutral countries to the Allies with glanders. The Germans' plans for biological warfare started in 1915 on the East Coast of the United States; they intended to infect and kill the livestock that were being sent to the Allies and facilitate the transfer of the disease to humans. The East Coast was where many animals were being assembled for shipment to the Allies fighting in Europe. The Germans also targeted Romania, Norway, and Spain's animal supplies with cultures of glanders. The German biological sabotage eventually spread to Argentina, where agents would rely on bacterial cultures from Spain to infect the cattle, horses, and mules that Argentina was supplying to the Allies. The German use of microbes as weapons is one of the only documented attacks of intentionally using biological weapons against neutral countries. The Japanese used B. mallei in their biological warfare research units. The most notable and notorious unit, Unit 731, used the bacterium to conduct experiments on live human subjects. However, the Japanese did not end up creating a biological weapon out of B. mallei. They did actually use B. mallei to test its effectiveness in contaminating water supplies, and the results of these tests were successful. The Russians' biological weapons program also took an interest in B. mallei and conducted field tests with it. Some of the researchers from the program were actually infected and killed by it during the course of their research. It has been suggested that the Russians eventually used B. mallei during their war in Afghanistan against the mujahideen.

It consists of a hardware unit with remote control, along with software for a Windows PC. Out of the box, it is capable of playing video and audio, displaying pictures, and \\"tuning in\\" to Internet radio stations. Alternative software is also available to extend its capabilities. It can be used as a front-end for various PVR projects. The MediaMVP is popular with some PVR enthusiasts because it is inexpensive and relatively easy to modify. Capabilities The MediaMVP can stream audio and video content from a host PC running Windows. It can display photos stored on the host PC. It can stream Internet radio via the host PC as well. It can display live TV with full PVR features with SageTV PVR software for Windows or Linux. The capabilities listed below refer to the official software and firmware supplied by Hauppauge. =Video= The MediaMVP supports the MPEG (MPEG-1 and MPEG-2) video format (and only that format). However, depending on the MediaMVP host software running on the host computer, the host software may be able to seamlessly transcode other video file formats before sending them to the MediaMVP in the MPEG format. The maximum un-transcoded playable video size is SDTV (480i). HDTV mpeg streams (e.g. 720p) need to be transcoded in real-time on the computer to SD format. Note: transcoding video can tax some slower computers. With a hardware MPEG decoder as part of its PowerPC processor, it renders moving video images more smoothly than many software PVR implementations. =Audio= Supported audio file formats include MP3 and WMA. Playlist formats supported include M3U, PLS, ASX and B4S. See also Internet radio below. =Photos= Supported image file formats include JPG and GIF. Slideshows are supported. Listening to music (including streaming Internet radio) during slideshows is supported as well. =Internet radio= Supports streaming Internet radio stations via the host PC. =Other capabilities= Can schedule recording of television broadcasts when using a Hauppauge WinTV TV tuner card with the Hauppauge WinTV recording software. Hardware The MediaMVP hardware consists of a small set-top box and an infrared remote control. It can be oriented either horizontally or vertically (using a supplied base). It's normally operated via the supplied remote control. Behind the unit's red translucent front panel is a single red LED. The LED is used as a power indicator, and also flashes when the unit's remote control is used. Typical (wired) units consume less than 5W. The power supply for the original MediaMVP consists of 6VDC, 1.66A Coaxial DC Power Connector. The outer sleeve is the negative terminal and the inner tip is the positive terminal. =Connectivity= The rear of the MediaMVP unit has a plug for 6 VDC power, an Ethernet port, and in the US edition, S-Video out, composite video out, and stereo audio out, while the European edition has instead a single \\"SCART out\\" connector, offering additional RGB output possibilities, and bundles a SCART lead with 2 extra stereo audio cables with female RCA connectors coming out of one of the plugs. Model 1016, the \\"wMVP\\", has Wireless G connectivity. however, this connection method can be inadequate for viewing digital television recordings depending on signal strength and reliability. A modified version of the unit is rebranded as Helius Media Stream and is fitted with a standard channel 3/4 RF modulator. This box is a better choice for TVs that lack separate RCA audio/video inputs. =Processor, RAM and firmware= The MediaMVP uses the IBM STB02500, a PowerPC 405 CPU integrated with functionality especially suited for use in set-top boxes, like MPEG2 decoder. The unit has 16MB of SDRAM. It runs on Linux-based firmware. Hauppauge has delivered enhancements and new functionality to the MediaMVP from time to time by releasing updated firmware. Firmware updates are delivered to the device when it is powered up. Hacks There are several hardware hacks of the MediaMVP box. Among others, there are hacks for adding S/PDIF optical output, a RS-232 serial port, and additional RAM. See the mvpmc hardware howto for more details on various modifications, as well as this thread at the SHSPVR forums. =Serial port= The serial port hack allows a serial console to be attached to the MediaMVP. This is useful for debugging modifications to the Linux-based firmware. Using the serial port hack and modifications to the unit's Linux-based firmware, it is possible to add a small external display (e.g. a LCD or a VFD display) to show status information (song title, for example). =Alternative software and firmware= *MediaMVP Media Center (mvpmc) - includes clients for MythTV, ReplayTV, Hauppauge, VLC, SqueezeCenter (aka SlimServer), VNC, UPnP, NFS and SMB.

She was awarded the 2006 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Biography Alegría was born in Estelí, Nicaragua, to a Nicaraguan father, Daniel Alegría, and a Salvadoran mother, Ana María Vides. When Claribel was nine months old, her father was sent into exile for protesting human rights violations occurring during the United States occupation of Nicaragua; as a result, Claribel grew up in Santa Ana, a city in western El Salvador, where her mother came from. Claribel Alegría considered herself to be Nicaraguan-Salvadorean. Although she was too young to read or write, she began composing poetry at the age of six and dictated them to her mother, who would write them down. Alegría consistently cited Rainer Maria Rilke's \\"Letters to a Young Poet\\" as the impetus for becoming a poet. At the age of seventeen, she published her first poems in Repertorio Americano, a Central American cultural supplement. Soon after, Mexican educator José Vasconcelos arranged for Alegría to attend finishing school in Hammond, Louisiana. In 1943, she moved to the United States and in 1948 received a B.A. in Philosophy and Letters from George Washington University. Alegría was committed to nonviolent resistance. She had a close association with the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which overthrew Anastasio Somoza Debayle and took control of the Nicaraguan government in 1979. Alegría returned to Nicaragua in 1985 to aid in the reconstruction of Nicaragua. Alegría later lived in Managua, Nicaragua. She died on 25 January 2018, aged 93.Muere la poeta nicaragüense Sofía Claribel Alegría Career Alegría's literary work reflects the style of the popular literary current in Central America during the 1950s and 1960s, \\"la generacion comprometida\\" (the committed generation). Like many other poets of her generation who are critical of their societies, she made claims for rights using a language which is often counter-literary. Alegría published many books of poetry: Casting Off (2003), Sorrow (1999), Umbrales (1996), and La Mujer del Río (1989). She also published novels and children's stories, as well as testimonios (often in collaboration with her husband, DJ \\"Bud\\" Flakoll), such as They Won't Take Me Alive.

It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest. The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom. Back pain is a common medical condition, generally benign in origin. Structure The central feature of the human back is the vertebral column, specifically the length from the top of the thoracic vertebrae to the bottom of the lumbar vertebrae, which houses the spinal cord in its spinal canal, and which generally has some curvature that gives shape to the back. The ribcage extends from the spine at the top of the back (with the top of the ribcage corresponding to the T1 vertebra), more than halfway down the length of the back, leaving an area with less protection between the bottom of the ribcage and the hips. The width of the back at the top is defined by the scapula, the broad, flat bones of the shoulders. Gray204.pngView of the bones of the thorax and shoulders from behind. Back Muscles.jpgPosterior view of muscles connecting the upper extremity to the vertebral column. A Trapezius B Teres Major C Teres Minor D Latissimus Dorsi E Levator Scapulae F Rhomboid Major Gray798-back crop.pngDistribution of cutaneous nerves, dorsal aspect. Dorsal and lateral cutaneous branches labeled at center right. =Muscles= The muscles of the back can be divided into three distinct groups; a superficial group, an intermediate group and a deep group.  Superficial group  The superficial group, also known as the appendicular group, is primarily associated with movement of the appendicular skeleton. It is composed of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor and levator scapulae. It is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves, reflecting its embryological origin outside the back.  Intermediate group  The intermediate group is also known as respiratory group as it may serve a respiratory function. It is composed of serratus posterior superior and serratus posterior inferior. Like the superficial group, it is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves.  Deep group  The deep group, also known as the intrinsic group due to its embryological origin in the back, can be further subdivided into four groups: * Spinotransversales - composed of splenius capitis and splenius cervicis. * Erector spinae - composed of iliocostalis, longissismus and spinalis * Transversospinales - composed of semispinalis, multifidus and rotatores * Segmental muscles - composed of levatores costarum, interspinales and intertransversarii The deep group is innervated by the posterior rami of spinal nerves. =Organs near the back= The lungs are within the ribcage, and extend to the back of the ribcage making it possible for them to be listened into through the back. The kidneys are situated beneath the muscles in the area below the end of the ribcage, loosely connected to the peritoneum. A strike to the lower back can damage the kidneys of the person being hit. =Surface of the back= The skin of the human back is thicker and has fewer nerve endings than the skin on any other part of the torso. With some notable exceptions (see, e.g. George \\"The Animal\\" Steele), it tends to have less hair than the chest on men. The upper-middle back is also the one area of the body which a typical human under normal conditions might be unable to physically touch. The skin of the back is innervated by the dorsal cutaneous branches, as well as the lateral abdominal cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves. =Movement= The intricate anatomy of the back provides support for the head and trunk of the body, strength in the trunk of the body, as well as a great deal of flexibility and movement. The upper back has the most structural support, with the ribs attached firmly to each level of the thoracic spine and very limited movement. The lower back (lumbar vertebrae) allows for flexibility and movement in back bending (extension) and forward bending (flexion). It does not permit twisting. Clinical significance =Back pain= The back comprises interconnecting nerves, bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, all of which can be a source of pain. Back pain is the second most common type of pain in adults (the most common being headaches). By far the most common cause of back pain is muscle strain. The back muscles can usually heal themselves within a couple of weeks, but the pain can be intense and debilitating. Other common sources of back pain include disc problems, such as degenerative disc disease or a lumbar disc herniation, many types of fractures, such as spondylolisthesis or an osteoporotic fracture, or osteoarthritis. Society and culture Painting of a woman's back by Edgar Degas. scar tissue on the back of Gordon, an oft- whipped slave. Extensive back tattoo. The curvature of the female back is a frequent theme in paintings, because the sensibilities of many cultures permit the back to be shown nude - implying full nudity without actually displaying it. Indeed, the practice of showing explicitness on the lower back has been performed for centuries. Certain articles of clothing, such as the haltertop and the backless dress, are designed to expose the back in this manner. The lower back is typically exposed frequently by many types of shirts in woman's fashion, and even the more conservative shirts and blouses will reveal the lower back. This happens for a variety of reasons- the lower waist area is a pivot point for the body and lengthens and arches as a person sits or bends. Secondly, woman's fashion typically favors tops that are waist length, allowing the back to be left bare during slight movement, bending or sitting. The back also serves as the largest canvas for body art on the human body. Because of its size and the relative lack of hair, the back presents an ideal canvas on the human body for lower back tattoos, mostly among young women. Indeed, some individuals have tattoos that cover the entirety of the back. Others have smaller tattoos at significant locations, such as the shoulder blade or the bottom of the back. Many English idioms mention the back, usually highlighting it as an area of vulnerability; one must \\"watch one's back\\", or one may end up \\"with one's back up against the wall\\"; worse yet, someone may \\"stab one in the back\\", but hopefully a friend \\"has got one's back\\". The back is also a symbol of strength and hard work, with those seeking physical labor looking for \\"strong backs\\", and workers being implored to \\"put their back into it\\". Historically, flagellation of a person across the back with a whip was both a common form of punishment of criminals, and a common means of forcing slaves to work. As well, self-flagellation, as in self punishment, may include the use of whipping oneself. This is one method of mortification, the practice of inflicting physical suffering on oneself with the religious belief that it will serve as penance for one's own sins or those of others. While more moderate forms of mortification are widely practiced—particularly in the Catholic Church—self flagellation is not encouraged by mainstream religions or religious leaders. A well-known instrument used for flagellations is the infamous Cat 'o Nine Tails, a nine-corded whip with one handle enabling a much more effective whipping than would be possible with only one lashing at a time.

Although originally intended as a high speed personal aircraft, the Cavalier was also exported for use as a fighter and close air support aircraft to third-world air forces. Development Cavalier 2000 In 1957, newspaper publisher David Lindsay (1922–2009) founded Trans Florida Aviation Inc. His intention was to transform surplus military P-51s into executive business aircraft. These aircraft were initially called the Trans-Florida Executive Mustang, soon renamed the Trans Florida Aviation Cavalier Mustang. The first of the Executive Mustangs was built in 1958 and for the next few years, only a handful of airframes were built and sold. To construct the Executive Mustang, Trans Florida purchased military surplus P-51s. The airframes were completely disassembled, the military equipment stripped out, and then rebuilt with a second seat, new avionics, plush leather interiors, luggage bays, and civilian paint schemes. By 1961, the aircraft were renamed Cavalier 2000, referring to the range. Five different Cavalier models were eventually offered: the Cavalier 750, 1200, 1500, 2000, and 2500, differing in fuel capacity, with the name indicating the approximate range of the aircraft. Over the course of the next decade, nearly 20 of these aircraft would be constructed. Several FAA approved modifications to the Cavalier design would be made during that time, including canopy frame mounted cockpit fresh air vents, wingtip fuel tanks, fuselage baggage door, 60 gallon ammo/gun bay fuel tanks, and a taller vertical stabilizer.Lowe 2009, pp. 167–169. Between 1964 and 1965, Trans Florida completed an IRAN inspection of over 30 F-51Ds of the Dominican Air Force (FAD) in Sarasota. In 1967 the company was renamed Cavalier Aircraft Corporation. Military Cavaliers =Cavalier F-51D= Cavalier Mustang, formerly of the Bolivian Air Force In 1967, a decade after creating their first civilian P-51 conversion, Trans Florida was contracted by the United States Department of Defense to create military specification F-51Ds for export. These military aircraft incorporated most of the improved features of the civilian Cavaliers but were optimized as ground attack fighters. These aircraft were called Cavalier F-51D Mustangs; nine single control (F-51D) and two dual-control (TF-51D) aircraft were built.Lowe 2009, p. 179. The aircraft were given new 67-XXXXX and 68-XXXXX serial numbers. Nine (including the two TF-51s) were given to Bolivia, under a program called Peace Condor and two, with tip tanks, were sold to the United States Army for use as chase aircraft, one of which is preserved at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. =Cavalier Mustang II= In 1967, Cavalier developed an outgrowth of the F-51D designed for close air support and counter-insurgency operations, calling this aircraft the Cavalier Mustang II. The Mustang II had improved avionics, structural improvements to the wing to allow more external weapons carriage on four additional hardpoints, and an improved Rolls-Royce Merlin V-1650-724A engine.Johnsen 1996, p. 74. Two batches of Mustang IIs were constructed: the first group was built for El Salvador in 1968 and the second group was constructed for export to Indonesia in 1972 and 1973. The five Mustang IIs (including one TF-51D) built for El Salvador featured wingtip fuel tanks to increase combat range. Five Mustang IIs and one TF-51D were built for Indonesia in 1972, but they did not have tip tanks due to a U.S. State Department restriction on their combat radius.Lowe 2009, p. 216. =Cavalier Turbo Mustang III/ Enforcer= Piper PA48 Enforcer in the Research & Development Gallery at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force In 1968, Cavalier mated a Rolls-Royce Dart 510 turboprop to a Mustang II airframe. This privately funded prototype was also intended for the same CAS/COIN mission that the Mustang II was built for. The Turbo Mustang III had radically increased performance, along with an associated increase in payload and decrease in cost of maintenance due to the turbine engine. Despite numerous sales pitches to the United States Air Force, neither the U.S. military nor any foreign operators purchased the Turbo Mustang III. Seeking a company with mass production capability, the Turbo Mustang prototype, now called \\"The Enforcer,\\" was sold by Lindsay to Piper Aircraft in 1971.Wagner and O'Leary 1997, p. 92. Cavalier Aircraft Corp. was closed in 1971 so the founder/owner, David Lindsay, could help develop the Piper PA-48 Enforcer. Lindsay set up a new company, Field Services Inc., to complete a Cavalier Mustang II contract for Indonesia. Many of the civil Mustang conversions, as well as many re- imported former military Cavaliers, have been restored into P-51Ds and fly on the U.S. and European air show circuits today.Lowe 2009, p. 178.

It covers an area of approximately and is surrounded by St Pancras and Islington Cemetery, the East Finchley public allotments, and the residential streets Creighton Avenue and Barrenger Road. It is the site of the discoveries which first led to the recognition that glaciation had once reached southern England. It was declared a local nature reserve in 2013, and is also a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade 1. History Southern entrance to Coldfall Wood The London Borough of Haringey contains four ancient woods: Highgate Wood, Queen's Wood, Coldfall Wood, and Bluebell Wood. All are shown on John Rocque's 1754 Map of Middlesex. Until the early 20th century Coldfall Wood was more than twice its current size, reaching south to the properties bordering Fortis Green.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 map of 1894, Republished as London Sheet 11: Muswell Hill 1894, The Godfrey Edition, Gateshead: Alan Godfrey Maps, 1985, The southern section was felled and partially excavated for gravel, before being used for residential development and the sites of Tollington and William Grimshaw schools (later Fortismere School). Tollington first rented and felled part of the wood for a sports field in the 1920s and subsequently moved to a new building on the site. William Grimshaw was built later to the north. Coldfall Wood was purchased in 1930 by Hornsey Council and the remaining section is now owned and managed by its successor, the London Borough of Haringey. It is bounded to the north by St Pancras and Islington Cemetery and Muswell Hill Sports Ground (formerly Finchley Common). Its western boundary is the boundary line between the London Boroughs of Barnet and Haringey. This western boundary and its northern boundaries are demarcated by the remains of an ancient woodbank with a ditch on the outer side. This would have prevented grazing animals from the surrounding Finchley Common and Horseshoe Farm (as they then were) from entering the wood and destroying the young coppice. Coldfall Wood has been examined in some detail by Silvertown (1978), who used historical sources to show that the woodlands are likely to be of primary origin (i.e. continuously present since prehistoric times).. In March 2011, the Friends of Coldfall Wood launched an online interactive map that included historical maps of the area overlaid on a modern streetmap, showing how the wood has dwindled in size since 1864. Flora The absence of foliage on this blasted oak lets light through to the woodland floor. Like the other local ancient woodlands in the area, the wood is dominated by oak standards, but the understorey is much less diverse and consists of almost pure stands of multi-stemmed, overgrown hornbeam coppice. Beech, hazel, mountain ash and wild service tree are all rare, though there are some fine specimens of the last species. Hornbeam understorey Little light penetrates to the woodland floor in the most wooded places and large areas of the wood are devoid of either shrub, field or ground layers of vegetation. Consequently, parts of the wood can present a dark and gloomy appearance in the summer months. Nevertheless, in the few glade areas, caused by the collapse of an occasional canopy tree, or by more recent coppicing, the flora is of considerable interest. Pill sedge hangs on in its only known Haringey site, and tiny populations of cow-wheat, slender St John's wort, wood anemone, and heath speedwell manage to survive, though they seldom flower. An area of approximately one acre was cut in the north-western corner of the wood in December 1990 with the assistance of the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, the Friends of Coldfall Wood, and the Haringey Branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The felled hornbeam poles were cut, stacked on site, and allowed to decay in situ to provide deadwood habitat for the benefit of invertebrates and fungi. Brushwood was used to construct a dead hedge around the coppice. This has protected the area from trampling, both by dogs and humans, and will hopefully provide a nesting habitat for wrens and other woodland birds. Regrowth from the cut hornbeam stools has been encouraging with a maximum growth of two metres being recorded by the end of 1991. The vegetational succession following the coppice is being carefully monitored by means of permanent quadrats. In the first year after coppicing, more than seventy species of flowering plant have been recorded here – a gratifying increase from the original flora of a mere six species. The newcomers include heath groundsel, which is unknown elsewhere in the Borough, suggesting the possibility that its seed may have lain dormant in the soil since the last coppice was cut before the Second World War. Ring counts of the coppice poles suggest that this was done about sixty years ago. The majority of new plants, however, will have colonised from outside and many of the arrivals are widespread ruderal species typical of disturbed open habitats, such as mugwort, sow-thistles and willowherbs. Rosebay willowherb dominates much of the area. A hundred years ago this was a rare plant in southern England and it was recorded from Coldfall Wood as early as 1901 (Kent 1975). The appearance of Sumatran fleabane was not entirely unexpected, for it has spread rapidly throughout Haringey since first being recorded from the Borough in 1985 (Wurzell 1988). It is also present in North Wood. There can be few other ancient woods in Britain that include this subtropical species in their flora. Geology The wood lies on the northern margin of the glacial ridge that forms Muswell Hill. The surviving section of the wood lies on London Clay overlain by head. To the immediate west and south this is overlain by gravels of a former course of the Thames, capped by glacial till of Anglian age.Sheet 256 North London, 1:50,000 Geology Series, Keyworth: British Geological Survey, 2006, It was here in 1835 that N. T. Wetherell discovered a strange mixture of rocks and fossils normally found in the north of England that led to the subsequent recognition of glacial deposits in southern England.Walker, H. (1874),The Glacial Drifts of Muswell Hill & Finchley, reprinted 1993, London: Jack Whitehead Improvements Coldfall Wood was selected as one of six \\"Flagship Woods\\" in the whole of London, to be included as part of the \\"Capital Woodlands Project\\" application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) which was prepared by a range of partners, including the Greater London Authority, the Forestry Commission, and several London Boroughs including Haringey. The bid was taken forward by Trees for Cities. The improvement programme consisted of the following projects, completed over a three-year period. # Coppicing commenced in November 2006, and resulted in an increase of ferns and flowering plants from 48 to 156 species a year later. # Four new bridges were added. # Two new reed beds were created. # Sloping tarmac paths were added to improve access through the various entry gates, as well as welcome boards, notice boards, and interpretation panels.

Cuny (November 14, 1944 – April 15, 1995) was an American humanitarian whose work spanned disaster relief, refugee emergency management, recovery from war and civil conflict as well as disaster and emergency preparedness, mitigation and peacebuilding. He was first and foremost a practitioner, but also a prolific author, an educator and a field-based researcher. He has been described as “a great American – a sort of universal Schindler, a man with lists of millions of people in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe whose lives he succored or saved.” Another tribute to Cuny claimed that he “was one of the world’s most accomplished disaster relief experts, both a pioneer and an iconoclast in the field of international humanitarian aid.”  Early life  Frederick Charles Cuny was born in New Haven, Connecticut. The family moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana, and later to Dallas, Texas when Cuny was eight, where he grew up during the early stages of the Viet Nam War. He dreamed of becoming a Marine combat pilot and obtained a pilot license while still in high school. He enrolled in the military cadet program at Texas A&M; University, left before graduating, and later transferred to Texas College of Arts and Industries in Kingsville. While at Kingsville, he became interested in humanitarian work after visiting low- income neighborhoods in Mexico and witnessing the plight of immigrant farm workers living in South Texas. He later attended the University of Houston where he studied urban planning and received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1967. After graduation, he worked in the small town of Eagle Pass, Texas on the Mexican border in a project funded under President Johnson's War on Poverty. There he developed solutions to long-standing infrastructure and public health problems.Cuny, Gene (1995), Fred Cuny, the Lone Ranger of Relief Aid. Tribute to Fred Cuny. p. 1. Essential to Cuny's success was his approach to grassroots participation, which later became a defining feature of his approach to humanitarian aid projects.Anderson, pp. 66-68. After Eagle Pass, ‘Fred,’ (as he was called by all who knew him) worked with the Carter and Burgess Engineering firm in Fort Worth, Texas, where he was assigned to the massive construction project of the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.Cuny, Gene. p. 2. Perhaps because of this experience, Cuny was often referred to as an engineer, though he had little formal engineering training. Nevertheless, his understanding of many engineering principles, his approach to planning by identifying specific problems and devising simple, practical solutions to them lent credibility to the assumption that he was an engineer.Anderson. p. 63. Having people defer to his assumed expertise became the norm for Cuny. He was almost universally described as ‘larger than life’ in every sense of the phrase. At 6 foot 3 inches tall in his Texas cowboy boots, Cuny was seldom lacking in self-confidence.  Work in humanitarian assistance  In 1969, Cuny experienced his first international humanitarian crisis when he traveled to Biafra, the region attempting to secede from Nigeria. “Biafra was where we first came to grips with dealing with famines, and the different ways of dealing with them—either food aid or market interventions.”Fred Cuny quoted in Shawcross. p. 17. Cuny observed the Nigerian government using food aid as a weapon of war, as well as the need for a more rational approach to humanitarian assistance. After Biafra, Cuny established Intertect, a small private company dedicated to providing technical assistance, mainly to voluntary agencies (now referred to as Non-Governmental Organizations or NGOs), the US Government, and United Nations organizations. He worked as a freelance consultant, a role he played the rest of his life. From his earliest endeavors, Cuny partnered with Jean (Jinx) Parker, who became the bedrock for Cuny's Dallas office, contributing to his writings and operations and providing a home base for Cuny's far flung initiatives. In 1970, one of the most destructive cyclones in history struck East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), killing some 300,000 people and leaving millions more homeless. The disaster was compounded several weeks later when civil war displaced 10 million East Pakistanis. Cuny was hired by the British NGO, Oxfam, to serve as an advisor in East Pakistan. He later described this assignment as life changing because it was there that he was first fully immersed in the vast, often dysfunctional machinery of the international disaster relief system, an array of international organizations, governmental agencies and NGOs.Anderson. p. 71. During these early years, Cuny made a series of observations about humanitarian operations. He noticed how often bureaucracies prioritized their political agenda and that agencies routinely were unrealistic about what they could achieve. He encountered corrupt local governments misusing aid, lack of coordination, poorly designed projects, incompetence among many volunteer workers and noticed that debilitating social and political systems often grew up around aid distribution. He saw that aid was almost always too late—in part because many large aid agencies were ponderous and hide-bound by past habits—and that it was often “junk aid,” food or material sent because it was available, not necessarily what was needed. He assumed initiatives should build on the interests and perceived needs of the affected population instead of assuming that material aid should be imported. These observations contributed to his determination to change the system. Cuny was typically unconstrained in his criticism of the humanitarian community status quo, including US government agencies, UN organizations and NGOs. But since Intertect, his consulting company, was wholly dependent on outside contracts, these entities often included the same people upon whom his livelihood depended.Anderson. p. 30, 31. It might appear that Cuny's career evolved from an initial focus on natural disasters, displaced persons emergencies and technical issues related to shelter and that it later turned to more complex emergencies, especially those related to conflict and the protection of civilians. In reality, his interests and observations covered all aspects simultaneously but the specific clients and disasters he was hired to address required narrower foci. Even though Cuny's career was not segmented by disaster type, the following subsections group general categories of emergencies as examples of some of his most important accomplishments. = Natural Disasters = Cuny was involved in various capacities in dozens of natural disasters. Typical projects included comprehensive needs assessments after disasters, analysis of emergency relief capabilities, pilot projects of housing reconstruction approaches and other reconstruction strategies. Because of Cuny's work in East Pakistan in 1970-71 for Oxfam, the NGO called upon him again after the earthquake near Managua, Nicaragua in 1972. Oxfam asked him to plan a camp for the earthquake survivors. This was his first use of shelter units forming a cluster around a common space to encourage community interaction, mutual support and security, as opposed to the military model of tents in a grid of straight rows.Anderson. p. 77, 79. Appreciating Cuny's work, Oxfam immediately requested Cuny's assistance with reconstruction after the Guatemala earthquake in 1976, one of the most destructive in the history of the Western Hemisphere at the time. The most heavily affected area covered 11,500 square miles (30,000 square kilometers). Approximately 258,000 houses were destroyed, leaving 1.2 million people homeless. Oxfam, and its partner NGO, World Neighbors, asked Cuny to conceptualize a strategy for housing reconstruction. His response was a novel approach called “Programa Kuchuba’l.” In it, Cuny incorporated a high degree of citizen participation at all levels and included an educational component for both the general public and local builders, with the goal of ‘building back better.’ Cuny respected traditional construction techniques but modified them to decrease structural vulnerabilities to future earthquakes. Instead of rushing in construction materials from outside the region, he recognized that using local materials and labor could strengthen regional markets and employment opportunities. He brought to his work a continuous modeling of creative strategies for maximizing the impact of project funds. Cuny's design and distribution of simple cartoon-like explanations of how to build safer houses using locally available materials increased the acceptance of the improved construction techniques. These field-tested illustrations could be understood by non- readers, were frequently complemented with text in the local indigenous languages and used again in Haiti and elsewhere.The Oxfam/World Neighbors Housing Reconstruction Program: Guatemala 1976—1977. Dallas: Intertect and Oxfam America. 1977. When the 1986 El Salvador earthquake left over 200,000 people homeless the United States Agency for International Development Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID OFDA) hired Cuny. He devised a unique ‘big-picture’ approach to recovery, unprecedented in the US Government's approach to disaster recovery. It centered on the El Salvador government purchasing under-utilized land and building multi-family housing for disaster survivors who had been renters and squatters, a population usually overlooked by external aid organizations. Sophisticated financing and self-help construction resulted in home ownership while the collective ‘sweat equity’ increased community ties. It holistically addressed the spectrum from emergency shelter to permanent housing in a compressed timeframe, treating all survivors as stakeholders, regardless of their pre-earthquake home ownership status. USAID OFDA subsequently requested Cuny's help after the 1988 Armenian earthquake. He surprised the US disaster chief, Julia Taft, by insisting that a higher priority for the plastic sheeting USAID had brought to provide temporary shelter for people be used instead for stabling animals, the primary asset people had left.Shawcross. p. 19. Alternative, more effective, solutions for human shelter were then developed. This was one example of the priority Cuny placed on restoring the livelihoods of disaster survivors. = Disaster Preparedness, Prevention and Mitigation = Cuny recognized that there were millions of low-income families worldwide living in houses vulnerable to disasters in disaster-prone regions. With the support of the USAID OFDA, Cuny and several Intertect colleagues assessed the risks to low income residents in disaster-prone regions, developed recommendations to retrofit existing vulnerable housing, designed country-specific approaches to future disaster- resistant housing construction and prepared training materials on these topics for local builders. These projects were implemented in Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Dominica in the Caribbean and in the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu in the South Pacific and in India.See Cuny et al at The Frederick C. Cuny/INTERTECT Collection, The OAKTrust Digital Repository, for each of the following documents: (1982) Improvement of Rural Housing in Haiti to Withstand Hurricanes; (October 1981) Improvement of Vernacular Housing in Jamaica to Withstand Hurricanes and Earthquakes; (1982) Como Mejorar Las Viviendas Tradicionales en la Republica Dominicana (How to Improve Traditional Housing in the Dominican Republic; Vulnerability Analysis of Traditional Housing in Dominica; How to Strengthen a Solomon Island House; (1982) Improvement of Low- Cost Housing in Fiji to Withstand Hurricanes and Earthquakes; Improvement of Housing in Tuvalu to Withstand Hurricanes; Vernacular Housing in Seismic Zones of India. Joint Indo-US Program to Improve Low-Strength Masonry Housing. Simultaneously, Cuny was the prime mover behind the implementation of three international conferences on earthen buildings in seismic areas that were held in Ankara, Turkey, Lima, Peru and Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. These conferences brought together seismic engineers, researchers and disaster response shelter specialists who built an international network to promote safe earthen and unreinforced masonry construction. The conference proceedings became a collection of best practices on how to use these techniques in earthquake-prone areas and spawned a now-robust attention to local building practices to build earthquake resistance into low-income housing. = Refugees and Displaced Populations = Cuny began developing guidelines for the design and management of camps for refugees or other displaced populations in 1970. His 1973 report on the Nicaragua camp plan and execution clearly reflects his training and skills in urban planning. He saw the camp holistically, as an integration of systems, including its layout, circulation, administration, sanitation, housing, water, lighting, recreation, organization of refugees, food distribution, waste disposal, storage and access to camp. This comprehensive overview formed the basis for his more detailed and pioneering guidelines on refugee camp planning.Cuny, Frederick C. (1973). A Report on the Coyotepe Refugee Camp in Masaya, Nicaragua Dallas, Intertect. In 1979, Cuny was contracted to advise on the Kampuchean refugee camp design and management in Thailand. He was able to implement the ‘community unit layout’ of camps, which integrated a sanitation/latrine solution as well as access to water into the design concept, aspects that proved fundamental to achieving public health as well as social benefits. He pioneered a series of writings and guidelines that revolutionized the thinking about how to best design refugee camps, how to keep them small and how to ensure the protection of refugees. Cuny's emphasis on social cohesion and dignity in his monographs about the layout of living areas in camps was eventually incorporated into the core principles of camp management among NGOs and the UN.Cuny, Frederick C. (1987). Camp Planning: Principles and Examples. Madison, University of Wisconsin Disaster Management Center. Retrieved Nov. 29, 2019. Cuny was also involved in several other refugee and displaced person operations, including Ethiopian refugees in Somalia in 1980; Palestinian refugees in Lebanon in 1982; Mozambican refugees in Zimbabwe in 1987; displaced persons in Sri Lanka from 1983 to 1988; and Ethiopian refugees in Sudan from 1984 to 1990. = Famine = One of Cuny's earliest insights into humanitarian assistance was in Biafra in 1969, when food aid acted as a magnet to pull people from the countryside into the towns and out of the towns to the airport. Aid agencies distributed food at the airport to maximize their own efficiency, but this destabilized the population, requiring them to leave their community to obtain the life-saving aid. This destabilizing practice of distributing aid continues to this day.Shawcross. p. 19. Cuny worked on numerous food crises and in each tried to see the longer-term picture. UN, government and NGO disaster agencies typically have mandates and capabilities to operate in only a few domains of a crisis, such as food distribution, water supply or health. During the 1984-85 famine in Ethiopia, Cuny demonstrated to aid agencies the importance of simultaneously working across multiple sectors and domains to address root causes and solve inter-sectoral problems.Cuny, Frederick C. (1986). A Season of Migration in the East, Dallas, Intertect. Retrieved Jan. 13, 2020. He conducted assessments of famine victims who had fled to Sudan from areas of Ethiopia that were affected by protracted drought, war and famine. They settled in camps around Showak and in the UN Food and Agriculture Organization camps in eastern Sudan bordering the famine areas of Ethiopia (Tigray and Eritrea). During this period, he recognized that many of the refugees wanted and needed to return to Ethiopia to work their land, despite the prospect of government persecution. Controversially, Cuny arranged to provide food and support to many, primarily men, who chose to voluntarily repatriate ahead of the rest of their population in spite of opposition from US government and UN representatives.Cuny, Frederic C. Famine and Counter-Famine Operations. Dallas, Texas, Intertect. Retrieved December 29, 2019. In 1986, Cuny led an inter-agency assessment of food needs inside Ethiopia that included the typical review of backup supplies and food availability. However, he extended the assessment to examine dependency problems, longer-term approaches to promoting dignified livelihoods and alternative food distribution methods. A year later, this led to Cuny's involvement in an ongoing innovative venture in which large quantities of cash were taken across the border from North Sudan into EthiopiaThe ‘Internal Purchase’ program, which involved the procurement of food from traditional areas of surplus production, was started in 1983. In 1990 OFDA significantly increased the money available to support the program, for which Cuny was instrumental in its implementation. See: Borton, John. The Changing Role of NGOs in the Provision of Relief and Rehabilitation Assistance, Working Paper No. 76. London, Overseas Development Institute, p. 39.

The complexities of changing currencies through third parties and the risks associated with carrying so much cash was novel for USAID.Cuny. Famine and Counter-Famine Operations.See the following reference for a detailed description of how the Director of the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, Andrew Natsios, authorized Cuny to smuggle $2.5 million worth of Ethiopian currency into Ethiopia to purchase food available in the local markets to support famine victims.

Retrieved Jan. 2, 2020. In two of his publications, Famine and Counter-Famine Operations and Famine, Conflict and Response: A Basic Guide, Cuny articulated innovative mechanisms to monetize food assistance and to use established commercial channels to distribute food during emergency operations. Relying on existing logistical networks and markets increased the speed and cost-effectiveness of food assistance during famine, while strengthening the local economy.Cuny, Frederick C., with Richard B. Hill (1999). Famine, Conflict and Response: A Basic Guide. A Kumarian Press Book. As the Soviet Union was beginning to collapse in 1990, there were concerns among the international community that the breakup might lead to a possible food shortage in the new republics that might, in turn, lead to a famine. In 1992, Cuny led assessment missions to several parts of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and was instrumental in developing the policies and approaches that the US Government later employed in assisting the states affected by the breakup. The dissolution of the FSU continued to lead to crisis in the region. Cuny and the Intertect team later provided assessment and planning in Mongolia, and in areas of Georgia, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan and Chechnya that were then at war. Cuny reported that food distribution was in a precarious state, but still functioning and he advised against staging a food relief program.Interview with Andrew Natsios. The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project Foreign Assistance Series, Initial interview date: April 24, 2018. p. 30. Retrieved Jan. 2, 2020. This experience in Russia was Cuny's introduction to the region. It contributed to his interest and subsequent involvement in his final humanitarian mission. = State Failure and Conflict = Most of the places where Cuny worked would today be classified as ‘fragile states:’ countries that often experience natural disasters, famine, civil conflict and/or population displacements simultaneously. As such, Cuny's analyses gradually evolved to focus on countries recovering from systemic crises. A notable example occurred just after a ceasefire agreement in Iraq between the US and Saddam Hussein's government in 1991, when the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq misjudged the moment as an opportunity to break away from the central government. However, the Iraqi army quickly suppressed the rebellion, causing hundreds of thousands of Kurds to seek refuge in the mountains on the Iraqi-Turkey border. The situation quickly became untenable, with many people dying daily in this inhospitable, late winter environment. The US military was called to provide humanitarian assistance but identified the problem as one of meeting the Kurds’ needs high in the mountains. Cuny was brought in to advise the US State Department and the military on how to do this. Rather than trying to support the massive population in such an unsustainable environment, Cuny proposed setting up safe zones in Northern Iraq and convincing the Kurds to return to the communities they had abandoned. But first, Cuny needed to convince two key decision-makers of his idea: the then US ambassador to Turkey, Morton Abramowitz, and the head of US military operations in Northern Iraq, Major. General Jay Garner. The concept required establishing a military coalition and humanitarian vanguard presence in Zakho in Northern Iraq in the midst of Saddam Hussein's troops and a series of warnings to the Iraqi military to withdraw. It was basically a bluff that relied on the Iraqi army's failure to foresee the consequences of establishing these safe zones.Kwiatkowski, Karen (April 14, 2003). Jay Garner's Missing Link. LewRockwell.com, Reviewed Dec. 29, 2019.Working with Cuny in this operation was a formative experience for several senior military officials, including Garner – later briefly the head of post-conflict and reconstruction planning in Iraq following the second Gulf War; Jim Jones, who became Marine Corp Commandant, US Supreme Commander Europe, and later National Security Advisor under President Obama; and John Abizaid, who became head of Central Command and Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The bluff worked. The operation was credited with saving thousands of lives, returning the Kurds to their homes in time for spring wheat harvest and planting, thereby increasing their food security during and after this crisis.Anderson. pp. 108 – 120.See the following reference for a detailed description of how the Director of the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, Andrew Natsios, supported Cuny’s approach to assisting the Kurds.

Ambassador Marc Grossman, Deputy Chief of Mission in the US Embassy in Turkey at the time, recounted his involvement with what was known as ‘Operation Provide Comfort,’ “Once we had established that safe zone in the north, just as Fred Cuny had predicted, 500,000 people went home. It was astonishing because plan B had been to set up nine or 10 massive refugee camps all along a valley in northern Iraq. Many people said that if that were the outcome, these would be the next Palestinians. Instead the Kurds went home.”Grossman, Marc (Jan. 30, 2006). Interview with Ambassador Marc Grossman.

In response to a developing famine in 1992, Cuny went to Somalia to help the US government set up a food supply program. He became increasingly supportive of the novel idea of using military assets to support aid distribution. He developed a set of recommendations for military involvement, highlighting the need for it to keep a safe distance from Somalia's political hot spots and especially to avoid operating within the capital, Mogadishu, as there would be negative consequences. The ‘Cuny Plan’ was endorsed by former Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, who gave it wide circulation in Washington, including at the Pentagon and at the State Department. The Plan was ignored and Cuny was left out of further planning, though the military deployed to Mogadishu and other cities. Cuny's predictions of military and political disaster proved prescient, the low point being the ‘Black Hawk Down’ incident in October 1993, in which 18 American servicemen were killed. Coming on the heels of successful work with the military in averting a humanitarian disaster in Kurdistan, Cuny saw his inability to convince the military of the risks of their operation in Mogadishu as a major professional blow.Anderson. pp. 121 – 127. = Protection = Although the focus of Cuny's career in disaster management seemed to evolve from applied engineering to human rights, in fact, human rights were always central to his understanding of any emergency. He became increasingly frustrated at the international humanitarian community's shortcomings in preventing the persecution and death of civilians. This community managed to house and feed countless people but was too often unable to keep them safe. Although UN agencies and the Red Cross had implemented legal ‘protection’ using diplomatic pressure for decades, Cuny felt there was a lack of action taken on the ground – especially when hostile parties ignored the Geneva Conventions and similar legal guidelines.Stein, Barry N., Frederick C. Cuny (Oct. 12, 1992). Refugee Repatriation During Conflict A New Conventional Wisdom. The Center for the Study of Societies in Crisis. p. 11. Retrieved Dec. 31, 2019. Cuny contrasted diplomacy with what he called ‘practical protection.’ He and his colleague Diane Paul articulated many ideas about how external agencies can promote practical protection, such as providing secure access to sanitation facilities and adequate community lighting. A key element involved placing relief operations in strategic locations that could facilitate daily contact with aid recipients and provide a watchful eye for potential threats. Another strategy included providing external agency staff presence among the threatened population as potential witnesses and strong deterrents to human rights violations.Bagshaw, Simon, and Diane Paul (Nov. 2004).

Thereafter, the threat of violence figured prominently in his thinking as he responded to myriad emergencies. The larger political or military realities that might endanger those receiving assistance were always reflected in his strategies, be it in locating latrines for Ethiopian refugee women in the Sudan or in providing water for Sarajevo citizens out of the line of sniper fire. His clarity of understanding and his innovative and practical approaches to relief confirmed the need to situate assistance activities within a protection framework, broadly understood.\\"Frohardt, Mark, Diane Paul, and Larry Minear (1999).

One of Cuny's successes in protection intervention occurred in Kuwait. In anticipation of the end of the first Gulf War, Cuny was a member of an advance USAID OFDA team based in Kuwait that planned to go into Iraq at the war's conclusion. However, the team discovered that the Kuwaiti authorities were targeting Palestinian refugee workers inside Kuwait under the allegation that these workers had expressed support for the occupying Iraqi forces. After the ‘liberation’ of Kuwait, the OFDA team's assignment was to help provide protection to the Palestinian population from bloody reprisals by Kuwaitis. Although there are reports of many Palestinians being murdered after the Kuwaiti sheikhs returned to power, Cuny and the OFDA team's intervention are credited with saving a great many Palestinian lives.Andrew Natsios’ comments in: 2007 Humanitarian Health Conference.

Retrieved Dec. 31, 2019. Early in the 1990s, Cuny met George Soros, a Hungarian refugee, financier and philanthropist. Soros was eager to use his considerable resources, channeled through his Open Society Fund, to bring western-style democracy to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Soros and Cuny agreed on an approach to support the encircled city of Sarajevo during the siege by Serbian forces who were committing ethnic cleansing in the surrounding countryside. The siege had cut off Sarajevo's main supply of drinking water. Hundreds of residents were killed by Serb snipers while drawing water from the Miljacka River or from outdoor wells. One of Cuny's and his team's most remarkable achievements was to restore the city's water supply system, thus enabling much of Sarajevo's population to obtain water at home without exposing themselves to sniper fire. His complex operation entailed custom-building several water filtration components in Houston, Texas. Each component was the size of a semi-trailer and filled a massive C-130 transport airplane. All the components were flown into Sarajevo and moved to secure locations for assembly. When the filtration system started working in the summer of 1994, sniper casualties fell precipitously, and 250,000 residents gained access to running water.Anderson. pp. 129-144. Cuny also arranged to fly in planeloads of reinforced plastic pipes, fittings and regulators so local residents could tap into the city's functioning gas lines and restore home cooking and heating. Once these supplies were released by Serbian authorities, Sarajevo residents began digging trenches through the streets for the pipe to be laid, linking thousands of homes to the lines.Anderson, p. 135. He also brought in a team that orchestrated a collaboration between Bosnian and Serb engineers to resolve a critical disruption of natural gas into the city. A final example of Cuny's commitment to protection involved his mission to Chechnya in 1995. Central to Cuny's objectives was the protection of some 20,000 civilians trapped in Grozny, the Chechen capital, the center of which had been bombed into a Dresden-like landscape. Cuny had hoped to find willing partners to go to Chechnya to create an ongoing international presence meant to deter Russian aggression against the civilians. Tragically, Cuny was unsuccessful when he tried to get the US government to endorse this tactic in March 1995.  Approach to his work, insights and innovations  Think outside the box. (People frequently used this phrase to define Cuny’s approach.) Cuny's insights led to many pioneering innovations in humanitarian assistance. He had an uncanny ability to solve disaster problems with new ideas and unique solutions. He frequently challenged the conventional wisdom of the multibillion-dollar humanitarian assistance community, which (often with the best of intentions) approached new disasters by repeating practices that were inappropriate for the situation and too often driven by political concerns. Across the fields of disaster preparedness, response and reconstruction, Cuny's comprehensive knowledge included not only an understanding of substantial aspects of all sectors of humanitarian assistance, but also of the political, economic and social contexts that allowed or limited what could be accomplished. He came to see disasters as a manifestation of the affected society's basic problems in these areas – and that disaster assistance done properly could positively impact the original problems. He looked at the interaction between systems and used this knowledge to identify root causes of problems and to articulate solutions. Many decision-makers were influenced by his comprehensive analyses and strategic planning skills. Instead of non- profit status, Cuny established Intertect as a private company to avoid having any limitations placed on his actions by a board of directors. He was concerned that a board might not allow him sufficient latitude for innovation, for transcending bureaucratic constraints and/or for deciding the level of risk he deemed acceptable. Even his model of for-profit consulting in humanitarian assistance was pioneering. During the early stages of reconstruction, Cuny often saw the big picture and anticipated how to plan a community's recovery to maximize the use of aid. He was an early proponent of using reconstruction activities and investments after crises as a ‘window of opportunity’ for economic development. Cuny viewed disaster responses as opportunities to galvanize communities, to potentially strengthening their relationships with their own governments (where appropriate) and increase civic activism. He recognized that building wealth among poorer populations was critical to disaster resilience and could facilitate positive long-term social change. He also witnessed that disasters could lead to negative social change – especially in war. Some of the principles that guided Cuny's approach to crises were to • keep solutions practical, typically using low-cost, local resources • probe the root causes of the disaster or conflict, not only its manifestations, and question conventional solutions • recognize that aid is often manipulated for tactical advantage by governments and local factions • monitor and evaluate what works and what doesn't In many ways, Cuny was a paradox. Many people who came to know and work with Cuny were endeared to his charm, charisma and camaraderie. Cuny was once described as having “an unassuming and energetic commitment to people in acute need.\\" However, where his admirers saw compassion, bravery and brilliance, his critics complained of arrogance and hubris. Again paradoxically, Cuny was extremely critical of United Nations organizations and governments, especially of the US Government. It bothered him to observe that these entities would often refrain from implementing their own mandates in the face of crises or that they would place politics above human suffering. Nonetheless, various UN organizations and the US Government itself were often his most important clients and individuals within these entities were often among his strongest supporters, or even patrons.See African Relief Efforts Hit for Lack of ‘Pros,’ by Jonathan C. Randal in The Washington Post, July 14, 1985, as an example of Cuny’s open critique in highly visible media of his UN and US government clients. In his youth, Cuny sought a career in the military. But beginning with Biafra and ending in Chechnya, he dedicated his career and his life to protecting civilians caught in the maw of war. He connected what seemed to be two disparate inclinations by increasingly seeking to use military assets as a potent partner in humanitarian assistance and protection strategies. Cuny possessed visions of greatness. As an adult, he once listed several of his life's goals. They variously included: sailing around the world, being “a man recognized and listened to by his peers, [and] a player standing at the vortex of great events.”Anderson. p. 103. Nonetheless, in spite of some of his loftier goals, Cuny's Dallas-based home and lifestyle were humble, even spartan. However, he did indulge his twin passions for flying his Piper Comanche airplane and his glider. His occasional vacations usually involved being aloft.  Institution Building  Cuny valued evidence-based research that demonstrated effective approaches to disaster/emergency management and wanted to be able to pursue field-based practical research topics. To that end, he created a non-profit entity, first called Intertect Institute, later the Center for the Study of Societies in Crisis and posthumously renamed The Cuny Center. Cuny assembled a comprehensive, unique library of literature on all aspects of disaster/refugee emergency management. In addition to hundreds of books and other publications, it included a large quantity of monographs, reports, and other unpublished documents not found in bookstores or in most libraries. The collection now resides at Texas A&M; University, in the Oaktrust Digital Library, and is called The Frederick C. Cuny/INTERTECT Collection.Frederick C. Cuny/INTERTECT Collection A large portion of the collection has been digitized through a grant from USAID OFDA. As early as the 1970s, Cuny recognized that a fundamental obstacle to the international community's ability to provide successful humanitarian assistance was the practice of staffing relief operations with well-intended but inexperienced people. He witnessed that the same mistakes made in one disaster would be repeated in the next. Cuny became convinced that the field of disaster management needed to be professionalized and capacitated. This led him to conceptualize and co-found the University of Wisconsin Disaster Management Center (DMC). In 1982, Cuny and the University convened two dozen global experts to map out the DMC's agenda and training topics. The Disaster Management Center was the first institution to offer access to training for humanitarian workers in the field through correspondence courses (instead of through prohibitively expensive travel to remote training sites). In 1985, with the support of Don Krumm at the US State Department's Refugee Programs, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) invited the DMC to develop the first technical training for their staff and implementing partners in refugee emergency management. Cuny was a key developer of the center's training materials and often presented at multi-week training events. Many who were influenced by Cuny first encountered him in training workshops. He was a spellbinding trainer whose hour-long lectures were filled with personal anecdotes, technical acumen and clear guidelines. He aggregated the text from many of his lectures in what is basically an anthology, entitled Emergency Relief Operations for Refugees: An Overview.Cuny Frederick C. (1988) Emergency Relief Operations for Refugees: An Overview. Retrieved Nov. 29, 2019.Anderson. p. 85. The model that was developed for UNHCR (custom developed training materials integrated into intensive workshops) was later adopted by many other UN agencies and NGOs and implemented through the DMC.Cuny, Frederick C.

In 1994, Morton Abramowitz, as the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Cuny conceptualized the creation of a permanent organization whose mission was to assess the plight of threatened populations then to mobilize the political will necessary to ensure a meaningful response. The organization was named the International Crisis Group (ICG) and Cuny was destined to become its first director of foreign operations. Cuny was killed before he was able to assume this role, but ICG has since been active in many of the global hot spots for over two decades.Adesnik, David (2011). 100 Years of Impact: Essays on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Washington, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Published on May 23, 2011. pp. 76-77. Retrieved Jan. 3, 2020.  Publications  Cuny was a prolific writer of influential books, monographs, papers and essays. The book, Disasters and Development, first published in 1983 by Oxford University Press, was his signature publication and inspired a generation of aid workers to think more methodically about what was needed in different types of natural disasters. It provided a framework for relief workers to design programs that best addressed priority needs, factoring in local capabilities and reducing vulnerability to hazards in the long term. This seminal book is still considered a landmark reference decades later, as relevant and readable today as ever.Cuny, Frederick C. (1983). Disasters and Development. One of the ironies of Cuny's legacy is the contrast between his reputation as a ‘cowboy,’ meant to refer to his free-willed, think-outside-the-box, making it up as he went along approach in crises, and the fact that many of the guidelines that his critics adopted were written by Cuny, such as his Assessment Manual for Refugee Emergencies for the Bureau for Refugee Programs, of the U.S. Department of State.(August 1985). Assessment Manual for Refugee Emergencies. Bureau of Refugee Programs, US Department of State. This manual informed the USAID OFDA's set of guidelines, still in use as the Field Operations Guide, which in turn helped frame the better known Sphere Handbook: Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response produced more recently by NGOs. Similarly, his early guidelines on refugee camp planning significantly influenced UNHCR's Emergency Handbook. He wrote a series of training modules for the University of Wisconsin Disaster Management Center, including Aim and Scope of Disaster Management, Principles of Management, Disaster and Needs Assessment, Camp Planning: Principles and Examples, Logistics, Displaced Persons in Civil Conflict as well as Logistics of People Movement. Famine, Conflict and Response: A Basic Guide, which Cuny authored with his colleague, Richard Hill, elaborated on many of his technical guidelines. Cuny recognized the reality of refugees who return home absent any formal arrangements. He dubbed this a phenomenon of ‘spontaneous return’ and documented examples of it as one of the neglected realities of refugee histories. Barry Stein, a professor at Michigan State University, also collaborated with Cuny on a series of books and papers about the factors facilitating the appropriate, well-timed repatriation of refugees back to their homes, including Refugee Repatriation During Conflict: A New Conventional Wisdom: Papers from the Conference in Addis Ababa,Stein, Barry N.; Cuny, Frederick C.; Reed, Pat (1995). Refugee Repatriation During Conflict: A New Conventional Wisdom: Papers from the Conference in Addis Ababa The Center for the Study of Societies in Crisis. as well as Repatriation During Conflict in Africa and Asia and Repatriation Under Conflict in Central America.  Disappearance  In late 1994, human rights activists became alarmed by the armed conflict in Chechnya. George Soros’s Open Society Institute asked Cuny to undertake an assessment in Chechnya to identify possible avenues of providing assistance to the besieged population. An assault by Russian troops launched on New Year's Eve transformed the Chechen capital of Grozny into a slaughterhouse. Cuny arrived five weeks laterFrontline website (1997). Frontline The Lost American. Retrieved Feb 4, 2020. to search for a way to reduce the conflict and provide assistance to the local population.Anderson. p. 179. Tens of thousands of Chechens had already fled Grozny. However, many (mainly elderly Russians) were left behind and were at grave risk of bombardment by the Russians. Cuny believed he could work with the Russian military and with Chechen rebels to evacuate the trapped population and avert a humanitarian nightmare. He hoped to use the evacuation of civilians as an excuse to broker a cease-fire.Frontline website (1997). Cuny returned to the United States in March 1995 and went public with a denouncement of Russia's brutal campaign. He wrote an article that appeared in late March in the New York Review of Books titled Killing Chechnya that was quite critical of the Russian military operation. High level US Government supporters of Cuny arranged for him to testify to officials in Washington. His briefings were passionate as he explained his plan to broker a cease-fire that could stop the killing.Frontline website (1997). Cuny's objective in those briefings was to get someone in the US Government administration to intercede with the Russians so that he could help evacuate the tens of thousands civilians trapped in the battlefield. However, no one came forward to take on that role.Anderson. p. 260. The war in Chechnya grew even more treacherous. Cuny returned to his base of operations in Ingushetia and on March 31, 1995, he traveled toward the deadliest region of Chechnya in a Russian ambulance with two Russian doctors and an interpreter. On April 4, Cuny and his three colleagues were captured by Chechens. His driver was released, and returned to Ingushetia with a message from Cuny saying that he was \\"okay\\" and expected to be released soon. This was the last Cuny was ever heard from. By mid-April, an alarm went out over their missing status and searches were organized by the Open Society Institute, the US Embassy in Moscow, the FBI, the CIA, the Russian FSB (the former KGB) and the Chechen military.Frontline website (1997). President Bill Clinton asked Boris Yeltsin, Russia's then-prime minister, to assist with the search. After several months of searching for Cuny, his son, Craig Cuny, and his brother, Chris Cuny, felt they had the information they needed to explain Cuny's disappearance. They received reports, believed to be reliable, that Cuny, the Russian interpreter and the two Russian doctors had all been executed near the village of Stary Atchkoi, a village controlled by the local Chechen intelligence chief.Katz, Jesse (Aug. 18, 1995). Lone Ranger of Relief Aid Feared Slain in Chechnya: Disappearance: Hip-shooting humanitarian worker Fred Cuny may have run out of luck in a lawless land. Los Angeles Times. Who ordered the execution has been debated extensively. There are various plausible theories. One is that the Chechen intelligence chief in Stary Atchkoi had Cuny and his team killed in order to take the money they were carrying. A second theory was that the Russian FSB had arranged the killing in retaliation for Cuny's outspoken criticism of Russia's brutal handling of the war.See Elizabeth Kvitashvili interview in which she describes the efforts of the US Embassy to persuade Cuny not to go to Chechnya in March 1995 and of Cuny’s lack of knowing that rumors had spread that his sponsor, the Soros Foundation, was a front for the CIA. The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project, Dec 5, 2016. Retrieved Jan. 8, 2020. William Burns - the American diplomat who coordinated the U.S. Embassy's search for Cuny - concluded that: \\"Cuny was likely caught in between two intelligence services - the Chechen who pulled the trigger and the Russians responsible for setting the trap.\\" A third theory was that the Chechen President, Dzhokhar Dudayev, had ordered their killing because Cuny may have come upon secret information about Chechnya's possible possession of nuclear war heads. [If Chechnya had these war heads, they would have been stored at a former ICBM installation on the edge of the village of Bamut, within just a few kilometers of where Cuny's convoy was initially apprehended and where Cuny's passport was later reportedly found by the Russian government.] The bodies of Fred Cuny, his interpreter and the two doctors have never been found.Frontline website (1997).  Marriage and children  Fred Cuny married Beth Roush Fernandez in 1966. At the time, Beth had a three-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and the two had a son together in 1967. The couple divorced after two years, with Cuny gaining custody of his son, Craig. Cuny moved to Dallas with his son and never remarried.Anderson. pp. 60-63.  Legacy, Awards and Tributes  Many efforts have been made to capture and characterize the enigma of Fred Cuny, to identify his motives and ambitions and to shed light on his accomplishments. Before Cuny's disappearance, when Morton Abramowitz was the president of the Carnegie Endowment, he told Samantha Power (later to become US Ambassador to the United Nations) that Cuny “is a practical man. He doesn’t just tell us ‘something must be done.’ He tells us what should be done and how we should to it. I’ve never known anybody like him.” In an obituary honoring Cuny published in Disasters Journal, Ian Davis (a collaborator in professionalizing the field of emergency management) wrote: “Many of us working in the same field are aware that many of our best ideas are ‘second-hand Cuny’...His cruel murder leaves a yawning gap in the leadership of international disaster management and refugee planning which will not be easily filled.”Davis, Ian (1996). pp. 75-78. Frontline, produced by WGBH and PBS, conducted a number of on-camera interviews to tell Cuny’s story in the 55-minute documentary The Lost American. It ran on PBS television stations on October 14, 1997. Narrated by the actor Harrison Ford, the show dwelt largely on Cuny’s final mission to Chechnya and on his personal life.Frontline show (1997). Subsequently, a 374-page book, The Man Who Tried to Save the World, by Scott Anderson, was published in 1999. It focused on telling the story of Cuny mainly as it related to his disappearance rather than on documenting the gamut of Cuny's achievements. One of the better summations of Cuny's achievements was by the author William Shawcross in his book-length review of global humanitarian aid, Deliver us From Evil: peacekeepers, warlords and the world of endless conflict, published in 2000. He dedicated a lengthy prologue to Cuny titled The World’s Texan. Shawcross, who knew Cuny from Cambodia and Sarajevo, reflected that Cuny “was an American original. He was not a quiet American; he was a loquacious one. His life and his work epitomized the story of humanitarian endeavor.” In 2015, Cuny's niece, Caroline Cuny, with Bryan Campbell, produced Looking for Trouble, a 22-minute documentary dedicated to the memory of Fred Cuny. The video showcases Cuny's search for solutions in war-wrecked Sarajevo and focuses on his creative water filtration and supply system. In May 2017, the Center for Strategic and International Studies hosted an event with a panel of speakers to commemorate Cuny's insights, titling the event Disaster to Development: Building Greater Resilience. A video of this panel discussion is available online. Cuny was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1995 but disappeared before he could officially receive his award.MacArthur Fellows Program, Frederick C.

A key prerequisite concept is that of a statistical ensemble (an idealization comprising the state space of possible states of a system, each labeled with a probability) that emphasizes properties of a large system as a whole at the expense of knowledge about parameters of separate particles. When an ensemble describes a system of particles with similar properties, their number is called the particle number and usually denoted by N. Classical statistics In classical mechanics, all particles (fundamental and composite particles, atoms, molecules, electrons, etc.) in the system are considered distinguishable. This means that individual particles in a system can be tracked. As a consequence, changing the position of any two particles in the system leads to a completely different configuration of the entire system. Furthermore, there is no restriction on placing more than one particle in any given state accessible to the system. These characteristics of classical positions are called Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (or M–B statistics). Quantum statistics Quantum occupancy nomograms. The fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical mechanics is that particles of a particular type are indistinguishable from one another. This means that in an assembly consisting of similar particles, interchanging any two particles does not lead to a new configuration of the system (in the language of quantum mechanics: the wave function of the system is invariant up to a phase with respect to the interchange of the constituent particles). In the case of a system consisting of particles of different kinds (for example, electrons and protons), the wave function of the system is invariant up to a phase separately for both assemblies of particles. The applicable definition of a particle does not require it to be elementary or even \\"microscopic\\", but it requires that all its degrees of freedom (or internal states) that are relevant to the physical problem considered shall be known. All quantum particles, such as leptons and baryons, in the universe have three translational motion degrees of freedom (represented with the wave function) and one discrete degree of freedom, known as spin. Progressively more \\"complex\\" particles obtain progressively more internal freedoms (such as various quantum numbers in an atom), and when the number of internal states, that \\"identical\\" particles in an ensemble can occupy, dwarfs their count (the particle number), then effects of quantum statistics become negligible. That's why quantum statistics is useful when one considers, say, helium liquid or ammonia gas (its molecules have a large, but conceivable number of internal states), but is useless applied to systems constructed of macromolecules. While this difference between classical and quantum descriptions of systems is fundamental to all of quantum statistics, quantum particles are divided into two further classes on the basis of the symmetry of the system. The spin–statistics theorem binds two particular kinds of combinatorial symmetry with two particular kinds of spin symmetry, namely bosons and fermions.

In all probability he is to be equated with the first-century Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus. Family background Knowledge of Curtius Rufus’ life is a collection of isolated sources. No continuous history of the type written by Plutarch and other biographers exists. The author of a continuous history of Alexander has none of his own. Much can be inferred from the incidental sources that do exist. =The self-made man of mystery= Curtius Rufus is a curtailed name formed according to the Roman naming conventions. The Romans had a 3-name system, but for ordinary use they curtailed it to one or two elements. The three names must not be thought to apply to any but free Roman citizens. Due to the almost continuous expansion of the territory of Rome from the early Republic, the non-free and freedman populations were mainly of foreign extraction. One name sufficed for them, although freedmen might take the name of their patrons. Curtius Rufus omits the praenomen, or first name. If the magistrate is to be identified with the historian, it must be Quintus, under the Republic spelled Quinctus, “the Fifth.” As the Romans used the same name in different generations, it may originally have had a numerical significance, but after dozens of Quinti it was perhaps just a name, abbreviated to an ignored Q. The indispensable portion of the name was the nomen, “name,” the name of the gens, “clan.” All males of the gens Curtia were named Curtius, and all females Curtia. This convention presented somewhat of a problem in distinguishing multiple Curtii, but the third name, the cognomen, offered a solution. It might have nothing to do with any convention. It could be trivial. Rufus means “red.” Over several hundred years of this system the cognomen often became an extension of the nomen for distinguishing lines within the gens. An important man would name the line, such as the Curtii Rufi. These conventions must influence the interpretation of certain remarks made by Tacitus and Tiberius regarding Curtius Rufus’ family background. A man with the name and associations possessed by Curtius Rufus is not likely to have been a commoner, or of humble birth. However, there was a circumstance of which both men were aware, but refused discussion; that is, it fell under the category of taboo. Of it Tacitus says: \\"Of the birth of Curtius Rufus, whom some affirm to have been the son of a gladiator, I would not publish a falsehood, while I shrink from telling the truth.\\"Tacitus, Annales 11.21 He does not say that Curtius was the son of a gladiator, but repeats that as slander, while affirming that he will not tell the truth. As he is not known for his irony or his hypocrisy, the most straightforward interpretation is exactly as he phrased it. The slander denies that the future consul was of the Curtii, a major accusation, since the Curtii were nobles from one of the earliest families at Rome. The implication is that Quintus did not share his family's consular rank because his biological father was not a Curtius. There are only two circumstances that could account for such a story: either Quintus was not the son of his name father, or he was not the son of either father or mother; i.e., not consanguineous to the Curtii. In the first case the suppressed information must be a salacious story about Quintus’ mother, which was probably the falsehood. In the second case, Quintus could have been adopted. The taboo element might have been the fact that his biological father was the gladiator, and therefore had been a slave, although not all gladiators were slaves. When confronted with the same story, Tiberius remarked “Curtius Rufus seems to me to be his own ancestor” (ex se natus). This remark, says Tacitus, “threw a veil over the discredit of his origin.” It is typically translated as “self-made man,” Tiberius may have meant to designate him as novus homo, a “new man”, the first member of a line to attain consular rank. He would not be that, however, for at least five years more. Tiberius may have meant that he intended to elevate Quintus. The Julio-Claudians were unfavorably impressed by legitimate pedigree, as, according to the Pax Romana instituted by Augustus, powerful nobles were a threat to peace and security, and so were suppressed. =Roman colonial from Provence= Provence in southern France today has the same name modified that it had in the Roman Empire, Provincia, “the Province.” During the Republic it was Gallia Transalpina, “Gaul over the Alps,” which the Romans colonized with settlements that became the nuclei of today's cities of southern France. In 35 BC the land on the Rhône just to the north of Marseille was of strategic interest to Octavian Caesar, the future Augustus. The river dividing around islands was easy to ford. Hannibal’s army had crossed there. Gaius Octavius took the location away from the Celtic tribe that held it, settling a colony of Roman soldiers, the veterans of Legio II. They were sworn to his personal command. He had just recently ejected Lepidus from the Second Triumvirate, acquiring without further dispute Spain, Gaul, and Italy. He still faced Mark Antony, who held the eastern provinces. Antony did not have the will to persist to victory. After his abandonment of his own fleet at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC he died hunted in Egypt by Octavian, who became official sole imperator (“commander”) in 27 BCE. Legio II was disbanded and immediately recruited into Legio II Augusta. Meanwhile, in 35 BC Legio II was one of two legions that had been recruited entirely in Sabina, a valley remaining to the Sabines under that name. They were Italic troops par excellence. The Sabines had contributed to the early population of Rome. The Roman Curtii in legend came from the Sabine Curtii. It would be surprising if none had joined Legio II. In 35 BCE, Legio II expelled the native Celtic population, the Cavares, from their village, Aurosia, and planted a colony there, Colonia Firma Julia Arausio Secundanorum. The land was redivided into lots by centuriation and distributed to its new owners. This location became in the Middle Ages the city of Orange, as well as a number of formerly smaller communities in the region. In 77, Vespasian for whatever reasons, ordered a survey done and a restoration made as closely as possible to the original grant. The result was a re-publication of the adjusted plots in public cadasters of stone. The word refers to either the plots or the register, which draws a map and lists the plots. Three of these, the Orange Cadastres, were found in fragments in the Orange area, lettered A, B, and C. They have been assembled to give, with lacunae, the lands plots of the restoration of 77. Cadastre B is of known date. A and C, of similar style, probably have the same date. Cadastre C is of interest in the biography of Quintus Curtius Rufus. In essence it says that, to the 97 2/3 non-taxable Jugera of the colony are added 15 ¾ taxable new Jugera comprising the Insulae Furianae, “Furian Islands.” The men to pay the taxes are “the heirs of Firmus Secundus”—that is, the descendants of Legio II. The phrase of interest is Q(uinto) Curtio Rufo II vir(o) et invent(ore), “Quintus Curtius Rufus being duumvir and discoverer.” André Piganiol’s exegesis of the text is as follows. The land must have been tax-free because it was granted to Immunes. This status was probably a problem for the municipality, which should have depended on revenue from land taxes. Q. Curtius as II vir for duovir, an early form of duumvir, found a way to generate some revenue by annexing the “islands” and charging the community for them. Since the main islands in the river must already have been accounted for, the Furian Islands probably refer to islands in the wetlands. As the duumvirate would never have been given to a man not of the community, this Q. Curtius must have been one of the heredes firmi secundi. Because the date of the cadastre is 77, he might be presumed to have been the son of the historian. Salviat modifies the argument as follows. Since the cadastres represent a restoration, they would be documenting a previous land distribution. The improvement of Cadastre C therefore might have been initiated at any time between Augustus and Vespasian. It would probably not be Vespasian's time, as it would have conflicted with the emperor's authority. There is no need to resort to a hypothetical son of Q. Curtius when he would do just as well himself. A second problem is that duumviri performed pre-determined functions or carried out locally the orders of the emperor. A duumvir would not have had the authority to make additions to the colony on his own. Salviat's answer is that Curtius was already an imperial officer, most likely Legate of Lower Germany, and was empowered to improve land, as he was doing by trying to establish a silver mine among the Germanics. His interest in Orange derived from the fact that he was from there and had already served as duumvir. He must have preempted one of the magistracies in order to assist his home town. Such an action implies the emperor's approval, whether standing or by direction.. The story told by Salviat, based on the evidence, is that of a local youth leaving home to see the world (perhaps via the big city at Marseilles) and coming back an imperial magistrate empowered to improve communities. He manages to levy taxes without violating the original grants. Those grants, however, were somewhat larger than today's city of Orange. The total area included such cites as Avignon, Nyons and Nîmes. They became known for their gladiatorial displays, but there is no evidence of any connection of those with Curtius. Cadastres A and B cover the territory to the east and west of Orange. Cadastre C must either overlap on those or be to the north. Salviat argues that it is on the extreme northern border, and the Fossa Augusta or “Augustan Canal” is not an irrigation ditch but is a major diversion of the Rhone intended to relieve the current at a confluence and provide a length over which boats could be towed. He picks therefore Valence as the best location of Cadastre C and Curtius’ home town. Encounter with the numen of Africa The first mention of Curtius away from home, and of his earliest position in the cursus honorum, is his \\"attachment\\" (haeserat) to \\"him who held Africa\\" (obtinenti Africam) as comes, literally a \\"companion,\\" meaning a staff member. The attachment refers to his tenure of a position, for which no doubt he had applied. Pliny the Younger explains that he was tenuis, \\"lean;\\" that is, \\"poor,\\" and obscurus, as are most young people beginning a career. The English translation of Curtius' employer is not very precise: \\"he attended the governor of Africa into that province.\\" The Latin is given in The officer is not stated in Pliny, nor is there any implication that Curtius followed him \\"into\\" that province, presumably from Rome. Tacitus states the position of Curtius' employer as quaestor, a financial officer, not the governor. Quaestor was not a military rank per se, although no doubt legions had them attached to the staff. There is no indication that Curtius had joined the army. Tacitus calls him a sectator quaestoris, where sectator, meaning at root \\"follower,\\" must be the same as Pliny's comes. Curtius is said to have \\"grown up\\" (adolevit), implying that he was a youth. There is no indication that he had been to Rome yet. Apparently he had found his way from Marseilles to Africa, where running out of money (tenuis) he found a position on the quaestor's staff. The quaestor would have worked for the governor. Who the quaestor was is not stated. Curtius' position on his staff is compatible with his later efforts to improve the revenue of his home town and of Lower Germany. While he was in Africa, Curtius seems to have had a supernatural experience, according to him, of which he made no secret; in fact, it may have helped his career in the superstitious Roman social milieu. In a letter to Lucius Licinius Sura concerning whether phantasmata are real objects, with their own \\"figure\\" (probably form) and a \\"divinity\\" (numen) or are \\"empty and vain\\" fictions of a terrified imagination; i.e., hallucinations, Pliny selects the former option because of \\"those things that I heard happened to Curtius Rufus\\". Curtius was at leisure in a portico when he became frightened by the preter-human figure of a woman, which the Tacitean version calls a species, \\"appearance.\\" Tacitus also supplies the information that the town was Adrumetum, today's Sousse in Tunisia, far from Alexandria. Pliny's account says that she said she was \\"Africa, harbinger of future things.\\" She said that he would return to the province as consul (Tacitus). For the time being he would go to Rome to win honors (Pliny), then come back with the supreme authority, only to die. Career through the praetorship Between Curtius' position as a young comes to the quaestor of the Province of Africa and his achievement of consular rank is a large gap. Tacitus says that he \\"departed\\" (digressus) to Rome, no doubt with high hopes for his future, \\"where through the lavish expenditure of his friends (largitione amicorum) and his own vigorous ability (acri ingenio) he obtained the quaestorship (quaesturam ... adsequitur).\\" Interpretation of the passage is important for its meaning. He was \\"departing\\" Africa for the city, not returning to it. When he got there, after an unspecified time he succeeded to the quaestura. The latter is a rank rather than a specific office. There were no doubt many thousands of quaestores in and around Rome. Tacitus gives no hint of which Curtius was, or where located, or how long he held it. There is no mention of being in the army; unless he were not in it, he could not stay in Rome, except in the Praetorian Guard, the \\"police.\\" Moreover, he is suddenly endowed with rich friends he did not have before, friends who were willing to supply the fortune required for the cursus. That one of them might have been Lucius Aelius Sejanus, chief of the Praetorian Guard, close friend, confidant, and agent of Tiberius, is likely. Sejanus had demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice himself to protect the emperor by covering him with his body during an unexpected rockfall. For many years he was the de facto chief of the imperial administration, but he had other talents as well. He had a literary circle of friends that included all the talented authors of Rome. Curtius might have imbibed some of that interest in writing by association. Although the circumstantial evidence points in that direction, there is no further statement by any surviving written work. Whatever quaestor he was, Curtius performed impressively, according to Tiberius. After an unspecified time he stood for Praetor, the next office below Consul. Tacitus says that he competed with \\"noble\\" (nobilis) candidates, but the emperor's vote was for him. The electoral body was probably the usual, the Centuriate Assembly, which, like all other institutions of government under the empire, received its direction from the emperor. The latter chose this time to make his statement about Curtius being a self-made man. This emperor in this story seems to appear as a public figure, which may indicate that the date of his vote for Curtius is before 26, when he retired to Capri on a permanent basis, leaving the government up to his trusted friend, Sejanus. If that is the case, and the apt candidate, Curtius, was being groomed for consular rank at the minimum age of 25, then he can have been born no later than the year 1. There were far fewer praetors at Rome than quaestors, but Tacitus still does not say which he was, or where located. The praetura he mentions is a rank. Tacitus' account (a single sentence) is all too brief for the regard in which Curtius was held. There are no achievements, no friends, no family mentioned. The most credible theory is that, if Curtius was an intimate of Sejanus, he must have shared to some degree in his disgrace. The missing years Sejanus did well at Rome in the absence of Tiberius. He commanded the same power and respect as though he were a Julio-Claudian. His troubles began when he aspired to become one. His path was to be the beautiful Livilla, Claudius' sister, then married to Tiberius' son, Drusus Julius Caesar. It was her second marriage, but not, apparently, a happy one. Whether by Sejanus' manipulation, as was later charged, or by unplanned emotion, she took Sejanus as a lover clandestinely. The two men argued violently in 23 on an unknown topic, Drusus striking Sejanus. Shortly thereafter Drusus died, from natural causes, for all anyone knew. The emperor suspected nothing. In 25 Sejanus requested permission to marry Livilla, which would have made him heir to the imperium, but was turned down. Tiberius' mother, the aged matriarch, Julia Augusta, died in 29. She had served as a restraint on the behavior of the family. In the first few chapters of the mainly missing Book V, Tacitus says: \\"An imperious mother and an amiable wife, she was a match for the diplomacy of her husband ...,\\" where the husband was Augustus. After she was gone, Sejanus with Livilla's assistance began to attack all potential opposition to their reign through a series of purge trials. Says Tacitus, \\"This at all events was the beginning of an unmitigated and grinding depotism.\\" Sejanus was acting with the power of consular authority. While the elimination of possible rivals was a politically sound course of action, and brought Tiberius' approval of a marriage in 31, through lack of a better successor, it was in terms of diplomacy and government a disaster. The other Julio-Claudians and most of Rome now hated Sejanus as a vicious tyrant, but blinded by love and ambition he failed to make that perception. Faced with the prospect of Sejanus as emperor, Livilla's own mother, Antonia Minor, went to Tiberius with accusations and proof that Sejanus and Livilla were poisoners who had murdered Tiberius' son. She could not be ignored. Moving swiftly by correspondence Tiberius ordered the arrest and execution of Sejanus. Livilla was given to the custody of her mother, who imprisoned her in a room and starved her to death. The Senate and the Praetorian Guard now moved to arrest and try for treason every friend of Sejanus and every family member, including his ex-wife and her small children. The youngest, a girl, went to the executioner begging that whatever she had done she would not do it again. She was raped before being strangled. The fury of the people seemed to know no bounds. Tiberius refused to return to Rome but ended his days in Capri in 37, at age 77. The empire was left without direction. There was no suitable successor to Tiberius. He willed the imperium to the joint rule of Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus. Caligula's first move was to alter Tiberius' will. Then he assassinated his co-emperor. Leaning heavily on the advice of the Guard he was for several months a good and popular emperor. After a near-fatal episode of either illness or poisoning his behavior became deranged, which is often accounted for by authors both modern and ancient as a result of brain damage. In 41 he was assassinated by a general governmental conspiracy, which agreed that his reign could not continue. On that same night, probably the one mentioned by Quintus Curtius Rufus, the Senate debated the abolition of the principate. The Praetorian Guard intervened to propose the election of Claudius, Livilla's brother, which was accepted with gratitude. These certainly were not the times when a popular new emperor could propose in person the success of a new man who had seen a vision. In the entire remaining historical record is not one word of Curtius Rufus, though he had been praetor (like Sejanus). Perhaps the answer to the puzzle was in the missing portion of Book V of the Annales. He managed to escape the purges of Sejanus' friends, which he surely would not have done if he had been an active supporter of Sejanus and a close friend of the family. Perhaps the numen of Africa saved him one more time. He could not become proconsul of Africa if he were executed. In any case nothing further is heard of Curtius for over a decade. If he was in fact the historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, this would have been the time when he researched his book. Since his major sources were most likely at the Library of Alexandria, he may have escaped to there. Being in the Province of Egypt, it would not have counted as Africa in the prophecy. Roman Africa was ruled from the old site of Carthage. A second possibility is that he returned to Valence to be duumvir there. He might have been to both places, but there is a total lack of evidence. It seems least likely that he would have found peace and security, or freedom of expression, in the late reign of Tiberius or that of Caligula. Military career Rufus was awarded a triumph by Claudius in 47 for opening up silver mines in the territory of the Mattiaci. This triumph, seemingly earned without military engagement, led to a sarcastic letter from the legions which begged Claudius to award triumphs immediately after command of an army was conferred.Tacitus, Annals 11.20 Later life Tacitus notes that during a long old age of \\"surly sycophancy to those above him, of arrogance to those beneath him, and of moroseness among his equals\\", having attained the consulship in 43 (suffect for Claudius) and his triumph in 47, he received the province of Africa, where he eventually died, in accordance with the earlier prediction.Tacitus, Annals 11.21 Pliny also notes in his letter to Sura that he was struck down with illness upon reaching Africa after the same female figure met him upon the docks. Recounting the prophecy, he is said to have given up hope of survival, even though none of his companions were despairing. See also *The Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus.

Lowery, who started the campaign 27 points behind his opponent but finished 10 points ahead, proved to be very popular as congressman. He was reelected five times with little difficulty. Lowery focused his efforts in Congress on improving San Diego. He was a major opponent of off-shore oil drilling, a major supporter of the reclamation of waste water and the Otay Mesa border crossing. Although there was no finding of wrongdoing by any government agency of Lowery's activities, he received substantial bad press in connection with the House banking scandal, and yet again, from his friendship with Don Dixon, a major player in the Savings and Loan scandal.

In the 1940s, he co-founded the Liberal Party along with Prince Norindeth, and was elected to parliament in 1951 and served under various ministry portfolios in the 1950s and 1960s.Preston et al. (2007), p. 305 In the 1960s Colonel Fernandez served as Secretary of State for National Security. In 1975, because of the cutting of US aid, the republican government's leaders wanted to stop the war unconditionally. However, Fernandez refused to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge if the government ordered FANK to lay down their arms during the negotiation; for this reason, he resigned as army chief. Fernandez and Lon Nol left the country before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975. All the republicans wanted to stop the Civil War in Cambodia. Several others officials such as Long Boret, Lon Non and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak remained in office until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975. Did they mistakenly think that they would be spared through the intercession of Norodom Sihanouk? On the contrary, the reality was they were executed by the Khmer Rouge. In 1998, General Fernandez returned to Cambodia to meet his former soldiers. He wrote a book about his life as the Commander-in-Chief of the Khmer National Armed Force. He left the country to become a roving ambassador. He died in France in 2006 due to complications from diabetes.

Background Led by José Gervasio Artigas, the region known as the Eastern Bank, in the Río de la Plata Basin, revolted against Spanish rule in 1811, against the backdrop of the 1810 May Revolution in Buenos Aires as well as the regional rebellions that followed in response to Buenos Aires' pretense of primacy over other regions of the viceroyalty. In the same context, the Portuguese Empire, then headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, took measures to solidify its hold on Rio Grande do Sul and to annex the region of the former Eastern Jesuit Missions. From 1814 on, the Eastern Province joined forces with the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios in a loose confederation called the Federal League, which resisted Buenos Aires' authority. After a series of banditry incidents in territory claimed by the Portuguese Empire, the Rio Grande do Sul, Portugal invaded the Eastern Bank in 1816. Artigas was finally defeated by the Luso-Brazilian troops in 1820 at the Battle of Tacuarembó.Doratioto (2002) The Portuguese Empire (formally the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves since 1815) then formally annexed the Eastern Bank, under the name Cisplatina, with support from local elites. With the annexation, the Portuguese Empire now enjoyed strategic access to Río de la Plata and control of the estuary's main port, Montevideo. After Brazilian independence, in 1822, the Cisplatina became part of Brazil. It sent delegates to the 1823 Constitutional Convention and, under the 1824 Constitution, enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy, more so than other provinces of the Empire.  Conflict  Oath of the 33 Orientales to the Uruguayan Republic. While initially welcoming Portuguese intervention in the rogue Eastern province, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata eventually urged the local populace to rise up against Brazilian authority, giving them political and material support with a view to reestablishing sovereignty over the region. Rebels led by Fructuoso Rivera and Juan Antonio Lavalleja carried on resistance against Brazilian rule. In 1825, a Congress of delegates from all over the Eastern Bank met in La Florida and declared independence from Brazil, while reaffirming its allegiance to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. In response, Brazil declared war on the United Provinces. The two navies which confronted each other in the River Plate and the South Atlantic were in many ways opposites. Brazil was a major naval power with 96 warships, large and small, an extensive coastal trade and a large international trade carried on mostly in British, French and American ships. The United Provinces of the Río de la Plata had similar international trading links but had few naval pretensions. Its navy consisted of only half a dozen warships and a few gunboats for port defence. Both navies were short of indigenous sailors and relied heavily on British - and, to a lesser extent - American and French officers and men, the most notable of which were the Argentine commander, the Irish born Admiral William Brown, and the commander of the Brazilian inshore squadron, the English Commodore James Norton.Brian Vale, \\"A War Betwixt Englishmen Brazil Against Argentina on the River Plate 1825–1830\\", I. B. Tauris, 2000, pp 13-28 The strategy of the two nations reflected their respective positions. The Brazilians immediately imposed a blockade on the River Plate and the trade of Buenos Aires, while the Argentines vainly attempted to defy the blockade using Brown's squadron while unleashing a swarm of privateers to attack Brazilian seaborne commerce in the South Atlantic from their bases at Ensenada and more distant Carmen de Patagones.Brian Vale, \\"A War Betwixt Englishmen Brazil Against Argentina on the River Plate 1825–1830\\", I. B. Tauris, 2000, pp 69-116 The Argentines gained some notable successes - most notably by defeating the Brazilian flotilla on the Uruguay River at the Battle of Juncal and by beating off a Brazilian attack on Carmen de Patagones. But by 1828, the superior numbers of Brazil's blockading squadrons had effectively destroyed Brown's naval force at the Monte Santiago and was successfully strangling the trade of Buenos Aires and the government revenue it generated.Brian Vale, \\"A War Betwixt Englishmen Brazil Against Argentina on the River Plate 1825–1830\\", I. B. Tauris, 2000, pp 135-206 On land, the Argentine army initially crossed the River Plate and established its headquarters near the Uruguayan town of Durazno. General Carlos María de Alvear invaded Brazilian territory and a series of skirmishes followed. Pedro I of Brazil planned a counteroffensive by late 1826, and managed to gather a small army mainly composed of Southern Brazil volunteers and European mercenaries. The recruiting effort was hampered by local rebellions throughout Brazil, which forced the Emperor to relinquish direct command of his Army, return to Rio de Janeiro and bestow command of the troops on Felisberto Caldeira Brant, Marquis of Barbacena. The Brazilian counteroffensive was eventually stopped at the inconclusive Battle of Ituzaingó. While Brazilian troops were prevented from marching on to Buenos Aires, Argentine troops no longer managed to operate in Brazilian territory. Ituzaingó was the only battle of some magnitude in the whole war. A series of smaller clashes ensued, including the Battle of Sarandí, and the naval Battles of Juncal and Monte Santiago. Scarcity of volunteers severely hampered the Brazilian response, and by 1828 the war effort had become extremely burdensome and increasingly unpopular in Brazil. That year, Rivera reconquered the territory of the former Eastern Jesuit Missions.

Latin America's Wars: the age of the caudillo, 1791–1899, Brassey's, 2003. the severe economic consequences imposed by the Brazilian blockade of Buenos Aires,The economic effects of the blockade and the lack of manpower for a full-scale Brazilian land offensive against Argentine forces. There was also increasing public pressure in Brazil to end the war. All of this motivated the interest on both sides for a peaceful solution. Given the high cost of the war for both sides and the threat it posed to trade between the United Provinces and the United Kingdom, the latter pressed the two belligerent parties to engage in peace negotiations in Rio de Janeiro. Under British and French mediation, the United Provinces of Río de la Plata and the Empire of Brazil signed the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which acknowledged the independence of the Cisplatina under the name Eastern Republic of Uruguay. The treaty also granted Brazil sovereignty over the eastern section of the former Eastern Jesuit Missions and, most importantly, guaranteed free navigation of the Río de la Plata, a central national security issue for the Brazilians. In Brazil, the loss of Cisplatina added to growing discontent with Emperor Pedro I. Although it was far from the main reason, it was a factor that led to his abdication in 1831. Legacy Although the war was not a war of independence, as none of the belligerents fought to establish an independent nation, it has a similar recognition within Uruguay. The Thirty-Three Orientals are acknowledged as national heroes, who freed Uruguay from Brazilian presence. The landing of the Thirty-Three Orientals is also known as the \\"Liberation crusade\\".Uruguay educa The war has a similar reception within Argentina, considered as a brave fight against an enemy of superior forces. The Argentine Navy has named many ships after people, events and ships involved in the war.

At the 2001 Census, the population of Northop was 2,983, increasing to 3,049 at the 2011 census. The community includes Sychdyn. The village is home to two pubs, a cricket club, and a golf course. At the centre of the village stands the church of St Eurgain and St Peter, towering 98 feet above the village. Northop College based in Northop, offering horticultural courses for students of all ages, in areas such as Animal Care, floristry, Horse Care, Horticulture and agricultural machinery. Glyndŵr University has a campus based in Northop; this is the University’s home for land-based and rural education, and a centre for courses on animal studies and biodiversity.  English name origin  The name seems to be derived from North Hope, to distinguish it from the nearby village of Hope, which has also been known as East Hoped. Another source claims the name originates from North and Thorpe, the latter word meaning village or town in the Saxon language. Written in ancient records as Northorpe, the name Northop was in use after the surrender of Chester to Egbert of Wessex, circa AD 828, when Flintshire was brought under Saxon rule.  St Eurgain and St Peter's Church  St Eurgain and St Peter There has been evidence of a church in Northop since the 6th century. It is said that Eurgain, a niece of Saint Asaph, passed through Northop and founded the church here on a Celtic mound, upon which it still stands. The Welsh placename for Northop, Llaneurgain translates as \\"The holy enclosure of Eurgain\\". Records indicate that there was a stone church erected here during the 12th century, with the tower being completed to its 98-foot height in 1571. The present building was extensively rebuilt during 1840, with further alterations being carried out in 1877. The churchyard of St Eurgain and St Peter still houses the old grammar school for Northop, constructed during the 16th century. St Eurgain and St Peter's church is the seat of the Parish of Northop, which comprises the districts of Northop, Northop Hall, Sychdyn, Halkyn, Rhosesmor, and Flint Mountain. Formerly it also included Connah's Quay. It is a member of the diocese of St Asaph, Church in Wales. The church is a Grade I listed building. Present The village shop also incorporates a one-counter post office. There are two pubs, one at either end of the High Street: the Red Lion; and The Boot, the last remaining coaching inn in the village that served the Chester-Holyhead stagecoach route.hairdresser and an MOT garage. Northop previously had a larger number of shops and services, but due to retail developments in neighbouring towns these have disappeared, including: butchers; fish and chip shop;tea shop; cobblers; Smithy; and a working men's club. Northop is also an electoral ward, coterminous with the community. It elects one county councillor to Flintshire County Council. Northop Silver Band In 1892 a group of young men met at Soughton (Sychdyn) and committed themselves to playing for a year with the newly formed silver band. Within two years they had relocated to nearby Northop. A bass drum, which was in use until fairly recently, has the mark 'Northop 1894' as proof of this fact. Very little is known of the early years as there are no written records but it is known that the bands' first contest success was in 1921 at Flint. The band at that time rehearsed at the Boot Inn which now supplies refreshments after practices. As a result of its success and professional attitude, the band has been fortunate enough to play at some of the most prestigious venues in the country including, the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, St. David's Hall, in Cardiff and the Royal Albert Hall in London. The 1980s saw the band become 'internationals' with a visit to Menden in Germany where, again, they performed with great professionalism. Recently band members joined forces with Parc and Dare Band from South Wales in a return visit to Germany to play at a Police Festival in Hamburg.

One of the early slogans was, \\"Anywhere we are US is.\\" \\"US\\" referred to \\"[us] black people\\" in opposition to their perceived oppressors (\\"them\\"). Foundation (1965) After the assassination of Malcolm X in February 1965 and the Watts riots the following August, the Black Congress was founded as a community-rebuilding effort in Watts. Two BC members, Maulana Karenga and Hakim Jamal, began a discussion group focused on black nationalist ideas, called the \\"circle of seven.\\" Hakim Jamal, cousin of Malcolm X, created a magazine entitled US. It was a pun on the phrase \\"us and them\\" and the standard abbreviation of \\"United States\\" and/or \\"United Slaves\\", referring to \\"Us Black People\\" as a nation.http://unitedblackamerica.com/black-history-maulana-karenga/ This promoted the idea of black cultural unity as a distinct national identity.Scott Brown, Fighting for US: Maulana Karenga, the US organization, and Black cultural nationalism, NYU Press, 2003, p. 38 Jamal and Karenga founded the US Organization. They published a magazine Message to the Grassroot in 1966, in which Karenga was listed as chairman and Jamal as founder of the new group. =Aims= Its aim was to promote African-American cultural unity. Haiba Karenga and Dorothy Jamal, the wives of the two founders, ran the organization's \\"US School of Afroamerican Culture\\", to educate children with the group's ideals. However, their husbands soon differed about how to achieve the group's aims. Jamal argued that the ideas of Malcolm X should be the main ideological model for the group, while Karenga wished to root black Americans in African culture. Karenga became the main active force in the group, organizing projects such as teaching Swahili and promoting traditional African rituals. Jamal believed that these had no relevance to modern African-American life, so he left \\"US\\" to establish the rival Malcolm X Foundation, based in Compton, California. Karenga became the driving force behind \\"US.\\" The group's ideals revolve around what Karenga called \\"the seven principles of Afrian Heritage\\" which he summarized as \\"communitarian philosophy\\": Unity (Umoja), Self-Determination (Kujichagulia), Collective Work and Responsibility (Ujima), Cooperative Economics (Ujamaa), Purpose (Nia), Creativity (Kuumba), and Faith (Imani). Creation of Kwanzaa (1966) Karenga's ideas culminated in the invention of the Kwanzaa festival in 1966, designed as the first specifically African-American holiday. It was to be celebrated over the Christmas/New Year period. Karenga said his goal was to \\"give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.\\" The holiday celebration is centered on rituals honoring the seven principles.Kwanzaa celebrates culture, principles For Karenga, a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of the holiday also underscored an essential premise that \\"you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose and direction.\\" Rivalry with the Black Panthers (1969) The Black Panthers and US had different aims and tactics but often found themselves competing for potential recruits. The Federal Bureau of Investigation intensified this antipathy as part of its COINTELPRO operations, sending forged letters to each group which purported to be from the other group, so that each would believe that the other was publicly humiliating them.Gentry, Curt, J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets. W. W. Norton & Company (2001) p. 622 This rivalry came to a head in 1969, when the two groups supported different candidates to head the Afro- American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.Brown, Elaine. A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story. (New York: Doubleday, 1992) p. 184 According to Louis Tackwood, a former informant with the Los Angeles Police Department's Criminal Conspiracies Section and author of The Glass House Tapes, Ronald Karenga was knowingly provided financial and material support by LAPD, with Tackwood as liaison, for US operations against the Black Panthers. = Gun battle at UCLA = On January 17, 1969, a gun battle between the groups on the UCLA campus ended in the deaths of two Black Panthers: John Huggins and Alprentice \\"Bunchy\\" Carter. This led to a series of retaliatory shootings that lasted for months. Later in 1969, two other Black Panther members were killed and one other was wounded by US members. A Memorandum of the Los Angeles field office of the FBI dated May 26, 1970, confirmed that the surge of conflict that left four Panthers dead suited their objectives and more would be encouraged: :\\"It is intended that US, Inc. will be discreetly and appropriately advised of the time and locations of BPP activities in order that the two organizations might be brought together and thus grant nature the opportunity to take her due course.\\" The Panthers referred to the US organization as the \\"United Slaves\\", a name never actually used by members of US but which is often mistaken for the group's official name.Floyd W. Hayes III and Judson L. Jeffries. \\"Us Does Not Stand for United Slaves!\\" in Black Power in the Belly of the Beast, edited by Judson L. Jeffries.

He was sentenced to 1-to-10 years in prison. Re-establishment (1971–present) In 1971, the women of the organization continued organizing while Karenga was imprisoned. After his release in 1975 Karenga re-established the organization under a new structure and it continues to operate.

He is listed among one of the ten principal disciples and was foremost in expanding on and explaining brief statements of the Buddha. In Thai Buddhism, he is also known as Phra Sangkajai and often portrayed as extremely portly.  Accounts  = Meeting the Buddha = In the Pāli tradition, Kātyāyana was born as Nalaka (), born of a brahmin family in the city of Ujjayini (, modern-day Ujjain). His father was a brahmin advisor to King Candapajjota, ruler of the state of Avanti. His name is explained by the golden hue of his skin (his parents called him Kañcanamānava, meaning the 'young man with golden colored skin'), and the name of the gotra. He received a classical brahmin education, which included study of the Vedas. He studied assiduously under his uncle and sage Asita, who had made a prediction about Prince Siddharta's future. In texts of several traditions, Asita's nephew is sometimes called Nālaka, but sometimes also Nārada, both of which are identified with Kātyāyana in those texts. After his father died, Kātyāyana became an advisor to the same king. At the king's request, Kātyāyana left with a group of seven friends to visit the Buddha to invite him to come to Avanti. The eight friends gained enlightenment while listening to him preach, and were ordained by the Buddha. As a monk, Kātyāyana became known by his gotra name. Nāgārjuna cites a text which he calls the Kātyāyanavavāda (\\"Advice to Kātyāyana\\") in his Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (15.7). This text appears to have been a Sanskrit parallel of the Pāli Kaccānagotta Sutta. = Soreyya = There is a famous incident given in Verse 43 of the Dhammapada commentary in which a man named Soreyya was traveling with a friend and happened to see Kātyāyana adjusting his robes. Upon seeing his golden complexion, Soreyya began to fantasize that Kātyāyana should become his wife or that his wife's complexion should be like that of Kātyāyana. Due to the nature of this thought, he transformed into a woman. He married a wealthy man from Taxila and bore him two sons. Soreyya later approached Kātyāyana and explained the situation, apologizing for his misconduct in thought. Kātyāyana accepted his apology, upon which Soreyya regained his male form. = Vassakāra = Another story relates the incident of a man named Vassakāra, minister of King Ajātaśatru. Upon seeing Kātyāyana descend from a mountain, the minister stated that he looked like a monkey. The Buddha advised the minister that he should ask Kātyāyana for forgiveness, lest he would be reborn as a monkey in the Veṇuvana forest. Vassakāra was certain that he would be reborn as a monkey, though, and as a precaution, he supplied that area with fruit and other trees. After death, he was reborn as the Buddha had predicted. = Past lives = In the lifetime of Padumuttara Buddha, Kātyāyana made the resolve to attain greatness after hearing the praise of another monk that shared his name. In this life, he was a vidyādhara and offered the Buddha three kanikāra flowers. After building a hut in the shape of a lotus and naming it Paduma (Pali; lit. \\"lotus\\"), he became a king named Pabhassara after thirty kalpas. It is also mentioned that he was a vidyādhara in the time of Sumedha Buddha. In the time of Kāśyapa Buddha he was a householder of Benares. He offered a golden brick to a caitiya that housed the Buddha's remains, and made a vow that in the future his body would have a golden complexion.  Propagation of Buddhism  Instead of the Buddha himself, the newly ordained and enlightened Kātyāyana returned to Avanti to teach King Candapajjota. The king was highly pleased with his attainments. He provided a royal park for Kātyāyana to live and treated him with great honor. Kātyāyana made numerous converts in Avanti, until the land sparkled with monk's robes, the texts say. He spend most of his time in Avanti, on a mountain called Kuraraghara. Nevertheless, he is said to have travelled to listen to the Buddha's sermons often, to the extent that his fellow disciples regularly left an empty seat for him to sit on. As Buddhism developed in Avanti, Kātyāyana made requests for amendments in monastic discipline to fit in better with the unique nature of the far land of Avanti. In the Divāyadāna, Katyāyāna is also depicted as propagating Buddhism in the Northwestern city of Roruka. After having received a painting of the Buddha produced by King Bimbisāra's artists, a king called Rudrayana wished to meet Buddhist monks and learn about Buddhist doctrine. The Buddha sent Kātyāyana to teach the king. Katyāyāna was received well and managed to introduce Buddhism in the region, with two monks ordaining under him. When Rudrayana's harem was interested to listen to his teachings too, Kātyāyana refused, however, pointing to a prohibition that the Buddha had given in this regard. Katyāyāna had a nun send to them instead. As for Rudrayana, after the queen fell ill and died, he wanted to be with her in the afterlife, and decided that ordination as a monk could take him there. After the First Buddhist Council, Kātyāyana lived in a woodland near Kosambī. = Discourses = Kātyāyana build up a reputation for expanding on brief statements and verses of the Buddha, that were sometimes not understood by the disciples. For this he was declared as foremost. Several early discourses are attributed to him. The Pāli texts state Kātyāyana taught the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta, the Kaccāyana Sutta, and the Parāyana Sutta. In the Madhura Sutta, King Avantiputta of Madhurā approached Kātyāyana some time after the Buddha's parinirvana with a question regarding the Brahmin's claims to superiority due to their caste. Kātyāyana pointed out that wealth confers power to people regardless of caste and that Brahmins experience the same results of good or evil conduct in the same way those of other castes do. Tradition also holds that Kātyāyana was the author of some verses of the Theragāthā, where he gives advice to meditators. = Philosophy =  Later texts  Kātyāyana figures frequently in Mahāyāna texts. In the Vimalakīrti Nideśa, he is one of the disciples who refuses to visit the lay bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) Vimalakīrti. In Chapter 3 of the Lotus Sutra entitled \\"Simile and Parable\\", Kātyāyana is one of four disciples to understand the Buddha's intention to his sermon about the burning house, and who rejoice in the idea of the united vehicle (ekayāna). In Chapter 6 entitled \\"Bestowal of Prophecy\\", the Buddha bestows prophecies of enlightenment on numerous disciples, including Kātyāyana. It is predicted that Kātyāyana will become a Buddha named Jāmbūnadābhāsa.  Heritage  Statue of Kātyāyana in Thai tradition Tradition attributes to Katyāyana the authorship of two late Pāli canonical texts, that is, the Nettipakarana, a commentary on Buddhist doctrine; and the Peṭakopadesa, a treatise on exegetical methodology. These are early commentaries, and they were the only commentaries considered by some traditions to be part of the early collection of discourses. Apart from these, the Kaccāyanavyākaraṇa, a work on Pāli grammar, is also traditionally attributed to him. In the Sārvāstivāda tradition, the Abhidharma text Jñānaprasthāna is attributed to him. The Jñānaprasthāna is more likely to have been composed by an author Kātyāyana who lived several hundred years later. It is possible that the Pāli texts attributed to him were composed by a school that descended from him. Tradition associates his name with a Buddhist community in Avanti, which is also believed to have been the origin of the Pāli Canon. Sanskrit sources state that Kātyāyana was the initiator of the early Sthavira school of Buddhism. Kātyāyana is often depicted holding an alms bowl in front of his chest.

Antisyntagmatarchis (, abbreviated Ανχης) is used in the Greek language to mean \\"Lieutenant Colonel\\". A typical responsibility of an Antisyntagmatarchis is to exercise command of a battalion. Officers holding this rank should be addressed as \\"Kyrie Diikita\\" (Κύριε διοικητά) (stressed on the last syllable), by their subordinates when they exercise battalion command or \\"Kyrie Antisyntagmatarcha\\" (Κύριε Αντισυνταγματάρχα) (stressed on the syllable before last) in other cases. The term was first used in the Greek War of Independence (1821 - 1827). The earliest known written use occurred in revolutionary government papers of 1822. In the modern Hellenic Army the rank is superior to a Tagmatarchis (Major) and inferior to a Syntagmatarchis (Colonel). The insignia consists of a flame and two golden stars. Most commissioned officers retire in this rank.

From the Weltchronik: King David with scribe and musicians (illumination from a manuscript in the Zentralbibliothek Zürich). Life Rudolf von Ems was born in the Vorarlberg in Austria. He took his name from the castle of Hohenems near Bregenz, and was a knight in the service of the Counts of Montfort. His works were written between 1220 and 1254. He is thought to have died whilst accompanying King Conrad IV on his advance into Italy. He was one of the most learned and also most productive poets of his time, although not all his works are preserved. Those that are, were distinguished by grace and sincerity in the narration, strict morality and technical mastery. He himself describes Gottfried von Strassburg as his ideal; this is quite credible, as he sometimes quotes literally from \\"Tristan\\". He also adopted Gottfried's technique of making literary excursuses in which he names works of contemporaries and of his own. He is thought to have died in Italy in 1254. Works Wilhelm von Orlens has a conversation with Princess Amelie Of his surviving works, the tale Der gute Gerhard (Gerhard the Good) is the oldest and also the best regarded, a depiction of Christian humility, probably based on a Latin source. This was followed by Barlaam and Josaphat, dating from approximately 1225 to 1230, taken from a Latin translation of a Greek version of the story of the conversion of an Indian prince to Christianity (a story which is believed in fact to be that of the Buddha, at many removes); and by Wilhelm von Orlens, the story of the childhood love of Willehalm and Amelie, who are among the most famous lovers of the Middle Ages. His Alexanderroman (Romance of Alexander), written about 1240, is a fragment. In 21,000 verses the upbringing and battles of Alexander are depicted, in which the hero is a model of knightly virtue. Rudolf's sources for this work were principally the Historia de preliis and the Historiae Alexandri Magni of Curtius Rufus. The Chronicle of the World (Weltchronik) is Rudolf's last work, dedicated to King Conrad IV. It narrates, as an addition to the Bible, the Historia scholastica of Petrus Comestor and the Pantheon of Godfrey of Viterbo, the history of the world from the creation up to the death of King Solomon, with the added motive of legitimizing the rule of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. As early as the 13th century this work was combined in many manuscripts with the Christherre-Chronik. A further work, Eustachius, is lost. Editions of works *Anon, 1967. Rudolf von Ems: Weltchronik.

It features squad-based combat at a skirmish level, although vehicles and large models were introduced in later supplements to the main rule book. Warzone was originally produced by the Swedish company Target Games. The rights to the Warzone brand were acquired by Paradox Entertainment in December 1999, in the wake of a complicated restructuring of Target Games and its child companies. Warzone has since gone out of print. As of 2020, the american company Res Nova LLC. has announced they have acquired the rights to Warzone and are developing a new Edition of the game. Setting Warzone takes place in a fictional dieselpunk future in which a space faring humanity has explored beyond Pluto and has uncovered ancient artifacts which unleashed an evil entity known as the Dark Soul and an obscure magical force known as the Dark Symmetry. This force soon started corrupting both man and thinking machines, instilling hatred and fear in their minds, then sent its own minions, consisting of legions of undead mutants and alien monsters called Nefarites, in an attempt to conquer humanity. In light of these events, technological and social progress has largely come to a halt. Most people are citizens of one of the major megacorporations, who have colonized the inner planets of the solar system, and who fight against each other when not fighting the evil forces of the Dark Soul. The Earth has become known as Dark Eden following a global apocalypse, and it is home only to tribal survivors and renegades. This background is intricately tied to that of the Mutant Chronicles role-playing game. Gameplay Warzone is a tabletop miniature wargame in which players take turns issuing orders, moving model troops on a model battlefield, and resolving combats that occur by rolling dice. It is played at the skirmish scale, where one model represents one soldier. The game became gradually more complex with later editions and expansions adding more details and special abilities. Warzone is mostly compared and contrasted to Warhammer 40,000, which targets the same market audience, and has similar gameplay, although Warzone never reached the latter's volume of market penetration . Warzone aims for a more realistic feel, being set in a more plausible future, with recognizable weaponry, megacorporations that represent modern-day nations and cultures, and a focus upon the power of units of soldiers, whereas Warhammer aims for more of a fantasy feel, with a greater variety of weapons, aliens, and a predominant focus upon the power of individual heroes. Editions Three different editions of Warzone have been produced through the years: the original Warzone, Warzone 2nd Edition, and Ultimate Warzone in 1998. All have since gone out of print. During the production of the third supplement for Warzone 2nd Edition, Target Games underwent a significant restructuring which resulted in the establishment of Paradox Entertainment as an independent company and the license for the Warzone brand being sold to them. Development and production of the Warzone line was not resumed after the disruption and a license to use the brand in the context of miniature wargaming was awarded to Excelsior Entertainment Owned by Thom Talamini and Christopher Schroeder (as well as licenses for the related Chronopia brand).TMP - Paradox Entertainment signs licensing deal for Mutant Chronicles: Warzone and Chronopia The remaining stocks of original Warzone and Chronopia miniatures were sold to Irish company Prince August, who still have copies of the boxed game and supplements of the second edition in stock.http://shop.princeaugust.ie/warzone-mutant-chronicles-wargame/ The original moulds were destroyed.

The population centre shares the name Norway House with the northern community of Norway House and Norway House 17, a First Nation reserve of the Norway House Cree Nation (Kinosao Sipi Cree Nation). Thus, Norway House has both a Chief and a Mayor. The community is located by air north of Winnipeg, by air east of The Pas, and by air south of Thompson. To drive from Winnipeg, it is approximately ; from Thompson, it is about . Major economic activities include commercial fishing, trapping, logging, and government services. Seasonal unemployment varies, with peaks as high as 70%. Norway House was an important establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company for most of the 19th century, serving as a major depot, and from the 1830s, as the seat of the Council of the Northern Department of Rupert's Land.  History  Norway House, Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, c. 1847 Norway House on Little Playgreen Lake SS Colvile docked at Norway House (circa 1880) After the arrival of Europeans in North America, the Hayes River became an important link in the development of Canada. The Hayes was the favoured route between York Factory and the interior of western Canada for explorers, fur traders and European settlers from 1670 to 1870, because transit was easier and food was more readily available. After Anthony Henday's explorations, Joseph Smith was sent in 1756, from York Factory, to explore the area. He ascended the Nelson River seeking Lake Winnipeg. He reached Little Playgreen Lake on September 21 that year. In 1816, Lord Selkirk sent out a band of Norwegians, apparently ex- convicts, to build a road from York Factory to Lake Winnipeg and a series of supply posts. They built Norway House at Mossy Point on the west side of the Nelson's outflow from Lake Winnipeg in 1817, replacing the former Jack River post at that location. In the last days of the rivalry between the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company, prior to their union in 1821, Colin Robertson, of the Hudson's Bay Company from their office in Montreal, organized a brigade of mostly French-Canadians led by John Clarke, bound for the Athabasca country to compete with the North West Company by developing the trade of supplying the colonists in addition to the company's usual business of trading furs. In 1822, Governor Simpson passed through Norway House in the depth of winter on his way to Cumberland House. Simpson traveled through Norway House to the Columbia District in 1824-25, journeying from York Factory. He investigated a quicker route than previously used, following the Saskatchewan River and crossing the mountains at Athabasca Pass. This route, which passed through Norway House, was thereafter followed by the York Factory Express brigades. In 1825 or 1826, much of the post was destroyed by fire. In 1826, the company abandoned its position on Mossy Point in favour of its present position on the East River, now known as the Jack River, in order to be nearer to the fishery, the food supply of its population. In 1830, Cumberland House, formerly the most important post in the interior, was supplanted by Norway House. From the 1830s, the Councils of the Hudson's Bay Company (annual meetings of its chief factors) met at Norway House rather than York Factory. These meetings would involve planning decisions for the following year and promotions from clerk to Chief Trader and from Chief Trader to Chief Factor. Such promotions were within the authority of the Governor and Committee. The recommendations of the council would be given to Governor Simpson who would make his recommendations to London. The last of the great Northern Council meetings that were started by Simpson a half century earlier was convened at Norway House by Donald Smith in July 1870. The men met around a great oak table with Smith as the new Governor, following his success in negotiations earlier that year concerning the Red River Rebellion on behalf of Canada, and empowered him to represent them in London concerning the rights of the Chief Factors and Chief Traders to share in the £300,000 transfer fee payable upon the surrender of Rupert's Land. The remnants of the former Hudson’s Bay Company fort established in 1825; the company's principal inland depot for the fur trade and the site where Treaty 5 was signed in 1875 was designated a National Historic Sites of Canada in 1932. Surviving buildings include the Archway Warehouse (1839-1841), the Gaol (1855-1856) and the Powder Magazine (1837-1838).  Demographics  The northern community of Norway House had a population of 308 in 2011 a decrease of 38.0% since 2006. The community included 155 private dwellings on a land area of 110.15 square km. Norway House 17 had a population of 4,758 in 2011 an increase of 16.9% since 2006. The community included 2,239 private dwellings on a land area of 72.99 square km. These two adjoining communities form a population centre of 5,066. Transportation  Provincial Road (PR) 373, an all-weather road, leads from Norway House past PR 374 which leads to Cross Lake, through Jenpeg and then joins Provincial Trunk Highway 6. There is a ferry that shuttles vehicles across the Nelson Channel just north of Norway House. This ferry runs most of the year, except into the winter months when an ice bridge is opened. The ferry is known to get stuck occasionally in the freeze-up season and cause delays. The most important means of transportation in this remote territory is the airplane. Manitoba Northern Airports maintains Norway House Airport with a crushed-rock airstrip. There are daily flights to Winnipeg on two private airlines: Perimeter Air and NAC Air. Services Norway House has several restaurants, two hotels, a Royal Bank branch, two Northern stores,2 Tim Horton locations and a KFC fast food restaurant, a full service post office, two video stores and paved roads within the community. The Kinosao Sipi Mall and the recently-added cell phone service are improvements to this northern community, as well as Norway House Cree Nation Broadband Internet, Norway House is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the NHCN Band police.  Education  The Helen Betty Osborne Ininiw Education Resource Centre is a kindergarten to Grade 12 school with preschool program as well. It was preceded by the Rossville Residential school. It is one of the most technologically-advanced schools in the province and one of the biggest schools of the Frontier School Division. Norway House is home to a regional centre of the University College of the North and has satellite degree programming from Brandon University's Faculty of Education and the University of Manitoba. Climate Norway House has a subarctic climate (Dfc) bordering a warm summer continental climate (Dfb). As is typical in Manitoba, precipitation patterns are dominant in summers, with winters being cold and dry.  Treaty and York Boat Days  The Treaty and York Boat Days are annually each summer from the beginning of August for a week; the York Boat events serve as the main attraction. These are team boat races with participants aged 8–18.

It is translated as \\"leader of a regiment (syntagma)\\", and dates back to the Classical Age armies. However, the name is misleading in that the Hellenic Army retains very few regiments in its command structure. Thus, the typical responsibilities of Syntagmatarches are in staff positions, or as Executive Officers in brigades. Officers holding this rank should be addressed as Kyrie Syntagmatarcha (Κύριε Συνταγματάρχα). In the modern Hellenic Army the rank is superior to an Antisyntagmatarchis (Lieutenant Colonel) and inferior to a Taxiarchos (Brigadier).

The film was released in the United States by Focus Features on July 28, 2006. Scoop received generally lukewarm reviews from critics and has been listed by several as one of Allen's weakest efforts. Plot Following the memorial service for investigative reporter Joe Strombel (McShane), Strombel's spirit finds himself on the barge of death with several others, including a young woman who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman (Jackman). The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British aristocrat with political ambitions, may be the Tarot Card Killer, a notorious serial killer of prostitutes, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim's body. Sondra Pransky (Johansson) is a beautiful but awkward American journalism student on vacation in London. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman (Allen), aka \\"The Great Splendini\\", and agrees to participate onstage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel's ghost. The ghost has escaped the Grim Reaper himself to impart his suspicions of Lyman to a journalist who can investigate the story. Sondra decides to infiltrate Lyman's privileged world to find out if he truly is the dreaded criminal, enlisting Sid in the process and taking advantage of his powers of deception. Sondra catches Lyman's attention by pretending to drown near him at an exclusive club's swimming pool. When he rescues her, she introduces herself as Jade Spence, daughter of a wealthy oil family from Palm Beach. While Sid poses as her father, \\"Jade\\" begins dating Lyman. Sondra is convinced Lyman is the murderer, but Sid finds it hard to believe. Sondra gradually falls in love with Lyman and begins to trust him. Sid meanwhile becomes less sanguine about Lyman as he notices more and more inconsistencies, especially after Sondra finds a Tarot deck hidden under a French horn in Peter's vault, a climate- controlled music room containing expensive antique musical instruments. Sid finally prevails upon Sondra to write a news story implicating Lyman, but the newspaper editor rejects the story because of Sondra's lack of proof. Throughout their investigation, Sid and Sondra have a relationship that is in turns friendly, paternal, and antagonistic—fueled largely by Sondra's annoyance that her smooth \\"Jade Spence\\" charade is being compromised by Sid's obnoxious attempts to act the part of a nouveau riche oil baron. Soon the police arrest the real Tarot Card Killer. Sondra, relieved that her suspicions were for naught, reveals her real name and the deception she and Sid had practiced. Lyman is surprisingly gracious, and tells Sondra he wants to keep seeing her. They plan to spend the weekend at Lyman's isolated country estate. Later, Sid (at Strombel's urging) suggests that Lyman used the Tarot Card murders to cover up a murder he committed. While Sondra and Lyman vacation in the country, Sid continues to investigate this theory. He finds that Lyman did frequent a prostitute, Betty Gibson, who was later killed, apparently by the Tarot Card Killer. Gibson is described as a \\"baby-faced blonde\\" (just like Sondra) before Lyman convinced her to dye her hair, presumably to match the profile of the other Tarot victims. When Sid calls Sondra with his findings, she waves them off. Unbeknownst to her, Lyman is listening in on another extension. Sid breaks into Lyman's vault again, this time finding a mysterious key, which turns out to be to Betty Gibson's flat. Meanwhile, in a rowboat on Lyman's lake, Lyman confesses to Sondra that he killed Gibson to stop her from blackmailing him and used the Tarot Card pattern to allay suspicion, just as Strombel had told Sid. Lyman comments on the irony that he first met Sondra by saving her from drowning, and now she really would drown. He would kill Sid later; no one would connect an obscure stage magician's death to that of a clumsy journalism student. This scene is intercut with shots of Sid driving madly to the Lyman estate to rescue Sondra, ultimately ending in a car crash. After his confession, Lyman throws Sondra into the lake and watches her go under. He then calls the police to report her drowning death. When they question him, he tells them Sondra was a terrible swimmer and almost drowned that first day at the pool. Suddenly, Sondra enters, soaking wet but smiling cheerfully. She informs Lyman and the police that the drowning had been an act to get his attention, and actually she was a very good swimmer. Back in the newspaper offices, the editor who previously rejected Sondra's article now congratulates Sondra on a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, the start of a promising career. Sondra seems flattered, and says she must also credit Joe Strombel and the late Sid Waterman, Splendini, who is now a passenger on the Reaper's ship, performing for his fellow spirits the same magical gags and comedy routines he did in life. Cast Production The lead character (originally an adult journalist) was tailored specifically to Johansson, whom Allen observed as having an unutilized \\"funny\\" quality about her while working on his previous film, Match Point. Although it was filmed in London, the film is the second of Allen's films (the other being Hollywood Ending) not to have a UK theatrical release. It was given a British TV premiere on February 7, 2009 on BBC Two. The film eventually came out on DVD in the UK on February 9, 2015 through Icon Productions. As is often the case with Allen's films, there is no original score. Most of the music heard in the film is by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Johann Strauss Jr., and Edvard Grieg. Critical reception The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. As of January 21, 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received and approval rating of 41% based on 149 reviews. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Rehashing old plot lines and characters, Scoop is a tiresome dipper and another disappointing addition to Woody Allen's repertoire.\\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 48 out of 100, based on 35 reviews. Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it the \\"worst movie Woody Allen has ever made\\": At the other extreme, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, who also gave positive reviews to Allen's Melinda and Melinda, called it \\"the funniest movie of the year so far\\" and Allen's funniest film in a decade. He also said: Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it \\"not especially funny yet oddly appealing\\": Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called it \\"fluffy, fatally implausible farce\\": The film was ranked as Allen's worst in a 2016 poll of Time Out contributors, with editor Dave Calhoun writing, \\"It's not radical to call it his low point.\\" The same year, film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked the film as one of Allen's weakest. Box office Scoop opened in 538 American theatres on July 28, 2006. In its first three days, it grossed $3,046,924 for a per-theatre-average of $5,663. Box Office Mojo listed its opening as the biggest limited release premiere of 2006. By the time the film's domestic run had ended on September 28, 2006, it grossed $10,525,717 in the U.S. and $39,212,510 worldwide. The film had a $4 million budget, not including prints and advertising expense.

The name uucp was a pseudo-domain-style suffix used in the 1980s when identifying a hostname not connected directly to the Internet, but possibly reachable through other inter-network gateways. The suffix was appended to a UUCP bang path separated with a dot, e.g., host1!host2!host3.uucp. The suffix prevented messages from being routed via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in mail exchangers, and it indicated that the hostname preceding it was reachable by UUCP networking.

As UUCP hosts were not always uniquely named, and there was no official global table listing them, although the UUCP Mapping Project was an informal effort to create such a list, actual access to one (e.g., for routing e-mail to it) required the use of a full bang path, which did not follow domain-name- style syntax, unless the particular software being used had been programmed to recognize particular hostnames in a domain style and route to them.

Political career Central Nova had been considered a safe Progressive Conservative riding, but its popular MP, Elmer MacKay, did not run for reelection in 1993. Skoke was elected in the gigantic Liberal landslide of that year as the party swept Nova Scotia and won all but one seat in the Atlantic provinces. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, drawing great controversy for her remarks on homosexuality in 1995, calling it \\"unnatural and immoral.\\"Kimber, Stephen. \\"The rightness of Roseanne Skoke,\\" Chatelaine, September 1, 1995 Due to redistribution prior to the 1997 federal election, Skoke was forced to run against fellow Liberal MP Francis LeBlanc for the Liberal nomination in her riding, which was renamed Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. She was defeated due, in part, to controversies surrounding her. She refused to campaign for LeBlanc in the 1997 election leading some Liberals to blame her for LeBlanc's defeat at the hands of Peter MacKay. Skoke attempted a political comeback by running for the leadership of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party later that year. She placed third. In 1998, she unsuccessfully attempted to win a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly by running against John Hamm in Pictou Centre during the provincial election.  Legal cases  In the 1980s, she was one of six people charged and convicted for disturbing an act of solemnity during a service of religious worship after she insisted on kneeling for communion at her Catholic church. Those convictions were later overturned in the Supreme Court of Canada. In October 2015, she began a private lawsuit against the bishop and Diocese of Antigonish after the diocese announced the coming closure of Our Lady of Lourdes church.

Life He was the third son of Morty Quin a distiller. In 1811 although a Catholic, he entered Trinity College as a 'pensioner'. Coming to London he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1818 and while waiting for practice devoted himself to journalism. For the Morning Herald he wrote an account of his experiences in Spain during the latter part of 1822 and the first four months of 1823, later published in book-form. In the following year he issued two translations, the memoirs of Ferdinand VII and a biography of Don Agustín de Iturbide. He became editor of the Monthly Review in 1825 and held that post for seven years. During this period he contributed many articles on foreign policy to the Morning Chronicle, and edited The Catholic Journal, a weekly newspaper which ran for one year only. Further travels in Hungary, Wallachia, Serbia, and Turkey furnished him with material for a new book in 1835, called A Steam Voyage down the Danube, which was so successful that it was translated into French and German. But his most lasting work was the Dublin Review, the leading Catholic periodical in the British Isles in his time. Of its first beginnings Cardinal Wiseman wrote: \\"It was in 1836 that the idea of commencing a Catholic Quarterly was first conceived by the late learned and excellent Mr. Quin, who applied to the illustrious O'Connell and myself to join in the undertaking\\". Quin became the editor and chief contributor, writing five articles in the first number and four in the second. But the enterprise was not remunerative. After two numbers he resigned the editorship, being unable to devote so much time and trouble without financial advantage, but continued to contribute articles to succeeding issues. During 1842 he edited The Tablet, pending the disputes between Lucas and the publishers. He married a step- daughter of Edward Wallis of Burton Grange, York, and had three daughters by her.

Overshadowed by his contemporaries, Claudio Monteverdi and Heinrich Schütz, Valentini is practically forgotten today, although he occupied one of the most prestigious musical posts of his time. He is best remembered for his innovative usage of asymmetric meters and the fact that he was Johann Kaspar Kerll's first teacher. The family name comes from deep roots in the native country of Greece. Well known for their classical music but also known for the family that branched off to the neighbouring country of Italy. Life Little is known about Valentini's life. He was born around 1582/3, probably in Venice, and almost certainly studied music under Giovanni Gabrieli there. Although the typical graduation Opus 1 of madrigals to be expected from a Gabrieli pupil – such as Opus 1 of Mogens Pedersøn (1608), Johann Grabbe (1609) and Heinrich Schütz (1611) – is not extant, Antimo Liberati (1617–1692) who worked in Venice in the 1640s records him in a letter of the 1680s as \\"Giovanni Valentini Veneziano, della famosa Schola de' Gabrielli.\\"Egon Kenton Life and works of Giovanni Gabrieli 1967 p84 In approximately 1604/5 Valentini was appointed as organist of the Polish court chapel under Sigismund III Vasa; his first published works are dated 1609 and 1611, when he was still in Poland. In 1614 Valentini was employed by Ferdinand II (who was then the Archduke of Styria) and moved to Graz. The Graz court's music chapel used enharmonic instruments extensively, which was of considerable importance for the development of Valentini's style; a contemporary account of 1617 praises him as a virtuoso performer on the enharmonic clavicymbalum universale, seu perfectum, which had a keyboard of 77 keys spanning four octaves. In 1619 Ferdinand was elected the Holy Roman Emperor and moved to Vienna with the court and the musicians of the Graz chapel. Valentini served as imperial court organist in Vienna for several years, then became court Kapellmeister in 1626, succeeding Giovanni Priuli, and accepted the post of choral director at the Michaelerkirche in Vienna in 1627/8. Valentini seems to have had an exceptional reputation and was favoured by both Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III (whom he tutored in music), as evidenced by several large monetary gifts from the former and financial support for Valentini's widow from the latter. In this respect, Valentini is similar to Johann Jakob Froberger, who also was a close personal friend of Ferdinand III. Valentini also seems to have been effective as Kapellmeister, managing to significantly increase the salaries for the court chapel musicians. For unknown reasons, Valentini effectively stopped publishing his music after 1626 (all of his poetry, however, was published after that year). He was involved in the production of the earliest Viennese operas and famously taught the young Johann Kaspar Kerll music, probably in the 1640s. Valentini held the position at the Michaelerkirche until at least 1631, but remained court Kapellmeister until his death in 1649. He was succeeded by Antonio Bertali. In his will, he bequeathed his works to Ferdinand.Léon Berben, liner notes to CD \\"Johann Capsar Kerll, Giovanni Valentini – Organ works by pupil and teacher (Kerll – \\"Scaramuza\\")\\", AEOLUS AE-10441 Works Valentini's oeuvre consists for the most part of different kinds of vocal music: madrigals, masses, motets and sacred concertos. Because he was apparently not interested in writing oratorios or operas, Valentini is sometimes regarded as a conservative composer, especially when compared to Monteverdi. This is, however, somewhat erroneous, as numerous works exhibit considerable innovations and elaborate experimentation. The 1621 collection Musiche a doi voci is probably the most famous example: it not only contains some of the earliest examples of the dramatic dialogue, but also features entire passages in 5/4 time (Con guardo altero) and consecutive bars of 9/8 and 7/8 (Vanne, o cara amorosa). Of the large-scale sacred pieces, the Messa, Magnificat et Jubilate Deo of 1621 contains three works scored for seven choirs (which is more parts than any music published before) and is an early example of printed trumpet parts. The rest of Valentini's masses exhibit features common to other composers' works in the genre; they include some conservative concertato settings and polychoral parody masses. Small-scale works such as motets and psalm settings are more interesting musically. Most are written using a modern concertato style, with virtuosic instrumental writing and, in some pieces, extensive use of chromaticisms. The motet In te Domine speravi is particularly notable for being one of the last ever compositions with a part written specifically for viola bastarda, a type of a tenor viol.Steward Carter, review of \\"STEVEN SAUNDERS, Cross, Sword, and Lyre: Sacred Music at the Imperial Court of Ferdinand II of Habsburg (1619–1637) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995),\\" Journal of Seventeenth-Century Music, Volume 3, No. 1 (1997) http://sscm-jscm.press.uiuc.edu/jscm/v3/no1/Carter.html , par. 3.2. The sacred concertos from the 1625 Sacri concerti collection are among the first sacred works written north of the Alps to employ stile recitativo extensively. The Secondo libro di madrigali (1616) is (along with the 1621 Musiche a doi voci) among the most important of Valentini's secular works as it is the first published collection of madrigals which combined voices and instruments. The instrumental arrangement plays diverse roles in different pieces, from mere embellishments to full integration into the polyphonic texture of the piece. The latter approach is also used heavily in Musiche concertate (1619). The duet and dialogue pattern writing seen in Musiche a doi voci is reminiscent of the duets from Monteverdi's Settimo libro de madrigali, published in 1619. Other works include keyboard canzonas in five or six voices (perhaps more adventurous harmonically than Froberger's four voice canzonas and capriccios, but contrapuntally less complex; a rarity for their time because of the number of voices) and instrumental pieces (sonatas, canzonas) that feature harmonic experiments in the vein of Valentini's motets. The 1621 chamber music collection, Musica di camera, includes pieces built on ostinato patterns such as the passamezzo, romanesca and ruggiero.

The term derives from táxis, \\"order\\", in military context \\"an ordered formation\\". In turn, the rank has given rise to the Greek term for brigade, taxiarchia. In Greek Orthodox Church usage, the term is also applied to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, as leaders of the heavenly host, and several locations in Greece are named after them.  Ancient use  In Ancient Greece the title/rank was held by a number of officers in the armies of several but not all city-states, with Sparta being a notable exception. In Classical Athens, there were ten taxiarchs, one for each of the city's tribes (phylai), a subordinate to the respective strategos. The perhaps most famous taxiarchs however were those of the ancient Macedonian Pezhetairoi infantry.  Byzantine use  The term first appears in use in the Byzantine army in the late 6th-century Strategikon of emperor Maurice, where it is reserved for the commander of the elite Optimatoi mercenary corps. In the 10th-century, the term was revived and refers to the commander of one of the new type of infantry brigade (taxiarchia), composed of 500 heavy infantry, 300 archers and 200 light infantry. On account of their numerical size, these units were also known as chiliarchia, and their commander correspondingly as chiliarchos, and are also equated to the thematic droungos under a droungarios. During the 11th century, with the demise of the thematic armies, the rank rose in importance, and eventually surpassed and replaced that of tourmarches, so that in the Komnenian-era army, the taxiarchia was the largest-scale permanent infantry formation.  Modern use  In the modern Hellenic Army the rank of Taxiarchos (abbreviated Ταξχος) is equivalent to Brigadier General with a NATO Code OF-6.STANAG 2116: \\"NATO codes for grades of military personnel\\", 6th edition, 2010, page A-2 The rank was introduced in the Greek military by Royal Decree on 5 June 1946,\\"Η ιστορία της οργάνωσης του Ελληνικού Στρατου (1821-1954)\\", Hellenic Army General Staff, Athens, 2005, p. 410 and the insignia instituted later in the same year.\\"Η ιστορία της οργάνωσης του Ελληνικού Στρατου (1821-1954)\\", Hellenic Army General Staff, Athens, 2005, p. 427 It is superior to a Syntagmatarchis (Colonel) and inferior to an Ypostratigos (Major General). The rank's insignia consists of a flaming grenade (replacing the crown borne under the Greek monarchy), a crossed sword and baton device and a six-pointed star. A Taxiarchos typically serves as the commanding officer of a brigade or as the executive officer of a division. In the Hellenic Air Force, which otherwise uses Royal Air Force- style ranks different from those of the Army, the equivalent rank (Air Commodore) is denoted as Taxiarchos tis Aeroporias (\\"Air Force Brigadier\\") or simply Taxiarchos.STANAG 2116: \\"NATO codes for grades of military personnel\\", 6th edition, 2010, page C-2 The rank is also used by the Hellenic Police (and the Greek Gendarmerie before) and the Cypriot National Guard. = Gallery = File:GR-Army-OF6-1946.svgRank insignia of a Taxiarchos, 1946–1959 File:GR- Army-OF6-1959.svgRank insignia of a Taxiarchos, 1959–1968 File:Army-GRE- OF-06.svgRank insignia of a Taxiarchos, 1975–today File:Hellenic Air Force OF-6.svgRank insignia of a Taxiarchos tis Aeroporias, 1946–today File:GR- Police-OF6.svgRank insignia of a Police Taxiarchos, 1984–today  References  Military ranks of Greece Ancient Greek military terminology Military ranks of ancient Greece Military ranks of ancient Macedon Byzantine military offices Christian terminology ","title":"Taxiarch"},{"id":"3524740","text":"Nebraska Raceway Park is a multiuse racing facility in southeastern Nebraska near Greenwood, Nebraska.

She is the wife of Joel Osteen and the daughter-in-law of John Osteen.  History  Victoria Osteen was born Victoria Iloff in Huntsville, Alabama. She lived near Marshall Space Flight Center where her father, Donald Iloff – a mathematician with General Electric – was a member of GE’s Saturn rocket project team led by German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. In 1963, at the age of two, Osteen moved with her family to Houston, Texas, when her father took a position with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). She grew up in a southern suburb of Houston, near the Manned Spacecraft Center (now known as the Johnson Space Center). Growing up, Osteen attended the Church of Christ, a relatively conservative church, where her mother, Georgine Iloff, taught Sunday school and her father served as a deacon. Osteen attended (though did not graduate from) the University of Houston where she studied psychology while working in her mother’s jewelry business. It was while working in the jewelry store that she met Joel Osteen in 1985 when he came in to buy a new watch battery.  Current activities  Osteen founded the Lakewood Church Women’s Ministry in 2003, where she currently serves as co-pastor. Her part of the service can be seen on a one-hour program broadcast on the Daystar Television Network and through a live internet feed. Her other activities include a regular feature on Houston radio station 89.3 KSBJ. She also supports the organizations Feed the Children and The Bridge, a shelter for battered women.H magazine article  Book publishing  Osteen’s first book, entitled Love Your Life: Living Happy, Healthy, and Whole () was published by Simon & Schuster and released for sale on October 14, 2008. It debuted at number 2 on the New York Times Bestsellers list. With 750,000 copies, the initial printing of Love Your Life was one of the largest by any US publisher in 2008. In January 2009, Osteen released children’s books published by Simon & Schuster's Little Simon imprint. Her five-year agreement with Simon & Schuster covers 13 books for children, including a Bible. Lawsuit In December 2005, on a Continental Airlines flight from Houston to Vail, a flight attendant accused Osteen of shoving her after a request was made about liquid on her armrest; this claim was disputed by witnesses. The FAA fined Osteen $3,000, and the flight attendant, Sharon Brown, subsequently filed a civil suit against Osteen, seeking $405,000 in damages. A Houston jury sided with Osteen, with the foreman calling the lawsuit a waste of time, clearing her of civil liability in August 2008.

Description Reston Town Center is located six miles east of Washington Dulles International Airport and 21 miles west of Washington, D.C., just north of Exit 12 (Reston Parkway) of the Dulles Toll Road (VA-267). Construction of the second phase of the Silver Line of the Washington Metro is underway, with the Reston Town Center station planned to be operational in April 2021. Reston Town Center is designed with open avenues and wide sidewalks. It is built around Fountain Square, a medium-sized open area between the surrounding shops. The main landmark in Fountain Square is Mercury Fountain, designed by Saint Clair Cemin. Directly in front of Mercury Fountain is Market Street, and across the street is the Pavilion. The Pavilion doubles as a covered open-air ice rink during the winter and as a concert and event venue throughout the rest of the year. Adjacent to the fountain are the One & Two Fountain Square buildings with the One & Two Freedom Square buildings located one block to the west. Street parking is available throughout, and seven public parking garages surround the center. As of 2019, Reston Town Center's \\"downtown\\" area has more than 50 retail shops and 30 restaurants. In addition, Reston Town Center has a 13-screen cinema which was renovated in 2012, and a Hyatt Regency hotel. Since the most recent major phase of construction in 2009, Reston Town Center, in the past known more for its shopping, dining, and entertainment, has developed into a location for businesses and residences also. High-rise condominiums have led to an influx of young professionals. Readers of Northern Virginia Magazine chose Reston Town Center for its 2008 top ten list \\"Hip to be Where\\", and it was dubbed a \\"downtown for the 21st century.\\" History Construction in December 2006 Reston Town Center was conceived and planned starting in the late 1970s by Mobil Land Development for approximately 460 acres of undeveloped land near Dulles International Airport.Michael P. Russell (7/17/2011), Reston Town Center—Soft Programming Makes Good Public Space Design Great, UrbDeZine Construction of the town center began in 1988, over 20 years after the founding of Reston in 1964 by Robert E. Simon. Phase One of the development opened in October 1990 and was built between Reston Parkway and Library Street. This initial phase centered around Market Street with two 11-story office buildings, One Fountain Square and Two Fountain Square facing the north side of the street. The office buildings were bookended by low-rise office and retail space. Along the south side of the street, smaller office/retail buildings and the Hyatt Regency hotel were constructed. Two public parks were established at the east end of the neighborhood. Following the completion of the first phase, Town Center Parkway was built as a future western border, allowing access to Reston Town Center from nearby thoroughfares. Nearly ten years later, construction commenced west of Library Street on Phase Two, starting on the north side of Market with the erection of the 18-story One Freedom Square and 16-story Two Freedom Square (completed in 2000 and 2001, respectively). Construction also began on the low-rise condominiums and townhomes surrounding Town Center Parkway. Development continued with the 2006 opening of three residential high-rises immediately west of Freedom Square, and the construction of the three South of Market office buildings which were completed in 2008. Along the south side of Democracy Drive, a nine-level parking garage topped by Democracy Tower was completed in 2009. The final portion of the second phase was completed in 2013 with the opening of The Avant, a 15-story apartment high-rise south of Reston Town Square Park. In late 2015, Boston Properties broke ground for the redevelopment of the surface parking lot north of Fountain Square. The Signature apartments, a pair of high rise residential towers, opened on the site in February 2018. Soon thereafter construction began across President's Street for a glass-clad office tower dubbed 17Fifty. The 17-story building took the place of low-rise retail built during the initial phase and opened in 2020.

The Nature Conservancy. This rare plant is a small herb bearing bright yellow cornucopia-shaped flowers. The plant was never distributed beyond the coastal area of Sonoma and Marin Counties, and has never been abundant. Activities in the area including quarrying, grazing, agriculture, and development further reduced the population of yellow larkspur to its current near extinction. It has been listed as an endangered species since the 1970s. Extremely isolated patches of the plant still exist on private property near Bodega Bay, where it is protected. Yellow larkspur is pollinated by hummingbirds and insects, and often hybridizes with two other Delphinium species if it receives their pollen. However, pure unhybridized individuals of yellow larkspur exist and the genetic diversity within the species is high. More recent conservation attempts have focused on specifically preserving the yellow larkspur species. A closely related flower in this region, Baker's larkspur, is also critically endangered, and the two species are often studied together.

Their traditional area of residence was in the Trigarta Kingdom, based at Jalandhar and at Kangra Fort.  Etymology  There are two possible origins for the word Katoch. Members of the clan say it comes from the words Kat (army) and uch (upper class) but other sources say that it comes from kot (fort). The Kangra fort was known as Nagarkot or Kot Kangra, and since the administrators/rulers resided within that particular kot they were vernacularly called \\"Kot'ch\\" or कोटच, which means those within the fort. This over time became Katoch.  History  The strategic Kangra fort commanded the respect of the region. The main branch of the Katoch clan were the rulers of the Kangra State, which was, by some accounts, the most prominent kingdom between the Ravi and Sutlej in the pre-modern period. The Kangra State was also known as Trigadh, a name derived from the ancient Trigarta Kingdom mentioned in the Mahabharata. The tradition holds that the Katoch were the rulers of Kangra from the times of Mahabharata till the pre-independence era. During Prithvi Chand II's reign, they defeated the army of Muhammad bin Tughluq which was not able to fight in the hills.

Then they were brought under the Mughal suzerainty by the emperor Akbar. The Mughal control was limited, however. The rulers of the states retained a fair degree of independence. Emperor Jahangir captured the Kangra fort in 1610, annexing the surrounding area and reducing the Katoch rajas to the status of vassals. After the decline of the Mughal power, Raja Ghamand Chand (r. 1751–1774) recovered most of the territory earlier ceded to the Mughals. Raja Sansar Chand (r. 1775–1823) established the supremacy of Kangra over all the surrounding hill states. During his reign, Kangra became a major centre for the arts and several palaces were built. In the year 1805, the neighbouring hill states rebelled, with the aid of the Gurkha army. Raja Sansar Chand was forced to seek the help of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore. The Gurkha army was expelled but Ranjit Singh also annexed the most fertile part of the Kangra valley, reducing the Katochs of Kangra as well as the neighbouring rajas to the status of vassals. After the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1846, the whole area was ceded to the British East India Company, eventually integrated into the Punjab province. The Katochs and the surrounding hill rajas were assigned small jagirs over which they had the rights of revenue and magisterial authority.  Clans and surnames  The Katoch clan one of the 14 ruling clans of the Himachal Pradesh and Jammu region in the medieval times. The other major clans are Jaswal, Guleria, Sibaia and Dadwal and Pathania. Dadwal stems from Dada, a place in Siba. Sibaia also stems from Siba. Guleria stems from Guler region. The four branches came into existence after the 11th century CE. Katochs suffixed 'Chandra' to their names until the rise of the Sikh dynasty in Punjab, after which some clan members started suffixing 'Singh' also. However, most clan members today, including in the sub-clans, suffix Chand. Until the reforms of 1930s, the Katoch women were only married westward, generally to the Pathania and Jamwal/Jamuwal men. The higher the sub-clan rated its own status, the farther away towards the west they tended to marry.  Regions ruled by the clan  In past centuries, the clan and its branches ruled several princely states in the region of Trigarta. Trigarta refers to the land between three rivers, namely, Beas, Sutlej, and Ravi. However, the clan lost lands and by the 17th century had been reduced to a small hill state. The originator of the clan was Rajanaka Bhumi Chand. Their rulers include Sansar Chand II and Rajanaka Bhumi Chand, the latter being the founder of the Jwalamukhi temple in Himachal Pradesh.

Solomon is the High Commander of a highly trained alien unit, sent to Earth by their leader, The Big Giant Head. His crew is made up of Sally Solomon (played by Kristen Johnston), Harry Solomon (played by French Stewart), and Tommy Solomon (played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt). In the first episode, \\"Brains and Eggs\\", Dick states that he has made a home of a \\"third rate planet, has a job at a third rate university, and now we are looking at a third floor apartment.\\" Work When Mary was growing up, Dick worked as a color spectrum particle separator at the Assemblage Dome. Dick works at Pendelton State University as a professor of physics, and shares an office with Anthropology professor Mary Albright (played by Jane Curtin). In the first episode the office is green with various pictures and certificates adorning the wall; after this, however, the office is antique white with tribal masks featured, presumably from Albright's anthropological studies (later it is found that she simply \\"bought them at airports\\"). Dick often uses his class, oddly enough the same throughout all six seasons, to gain a better understanding of humanity by assigning arbitrary essays on which their grade depends. Dick never has the idea that they're actually learning something, but when he finally gets through to them \\"his father\\" came in, dismissing the class because he needed to talk to Dick. Love life Throughout the course of the series, Dick maintains a tense love-hate relationship with Mary Albright. At times they are together, while at others Mary quite clearly disfavors Dick. At one point, at the end of the second season, Dick and Mary are to be married as the other Solomons (Sally, Harry, and Tommy) return to the home planet. At one point, Dick discovers what he calls the \\"freedom\\" of casual sex. He has sex with the recently divorced mother of a student, Bug (David DeLuise) when she is in on holiday, not knowing who she is. Dick realizes the identity of his partner when, as he frequently does, he relates his sexual experience to his class. At the end of the episode, Bug's father (portrayed by David DeLuise's father Dom DeLuise) walks into Dick's office wearing a fedora flanked by two brutes (portrayed by DeLuise' real-life sons Michael and Peter) who seem to have a connection to the mob.

Its licenses include products based on the science fiction properties Traveller, Judge Dredd, and Paranoia, as well as fantasy titles.  History  Mongoose Publishing was founded in Swindon, England, in 2001 by Matthew Sprange and Alex Fennell.Mongoose Publishing official website, about usMatthew Sprange interview, in RPG.net, a role-playing-games specialised website Sprange initially wanted to publish a miniatures game, but he went with a less expensive alternative using Wizards of the Coast's d20 System Trademark License. It grew out of the d20 System boom sparked by Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. The first release, the Slayer's Guides, concentrated on different monster types for the d20 system, while the subsequent Quintessential books, detailed specific character classes. The latter was to span three years and thirty-six different titles. In 2003 the company released the magazine Signs and Portents, a house organ aimed at supplementing and supporting Mongoose's products, as well as a range of generic standalone products based on the d20 System, collectively known as the \\"OGL series\\". Further acquisitions followed the same year, including the rights to a roleplaying game based on Conan the Barbarian (released in 2004), the roleplaying game Paranoia and a joint venture with d20 System portal EN World, the EN World Gamer quarterly magazine. Signs & Portents was turned into an online magazine after two years.http://www.mongoosepublishing.com Signs & Portents. In 2007, Mongoose added the licenses for new editions of the classic RPGs RuneQuest and Traveller. In 2008 Mongoose announced that it was ceasing production and marketing of its miniatures ranges and would, for the time being, concentrate solely on the production of RPGs and miniatures rules. In September 2008, Matthew Sprange announced that Mongoose Publishing had \\"joined the Rebellion, becoming a sister company to Rebellion itself.\\"Mongoose Joins Rebellion, ICv2, September 2, 2008.

The 1957 comedy film The Sad Sack starring Jerry Lewis was based on Baker's fictional character. Biography =Early life and education= Baker was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, living there until 1923. He grew up in Rock Island, Illinois, and Chicago. In Chicago, he attended Lane Tech High School and graduated from Roosevelt High, where he played baseball and drew pictures for the high school annual. =Commercial artist= After six weeks of art training in a night school, he got a job as a commercial artist \\"but soon grew tired of drawing pots and pans for newspaper advertisements.\\"Current Biography 1944, pp. 28-30. =Disney days= He moved to California to pursue a baseball career. Instead, he was hired by Walt Disney in 1937, and assisted in the production of the studio's full-length animated features, including Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi. His specialty was animation of thunderstorms, waterfalls and other effects.Id. at 28 =World War II= Five months prior to Pearl Harbor, Baker was drafted (June 1941) into the United States Army. He related later that he expected that the Army Classification System would have no use for his artistic experience, noting \\"They say it makes cooks out of mechanics, and vice versa. But I must say, it worked perfectly in my case.\\" To his surprise, he was assigned to Fort Monmouth for basic training and to create animation for Signal Corps training films. Baker won a cartoon contest, sponsored by the \\"Defense Recreation Committee\\", and received a portable typewriter as first prize. Life magazine printed some of his submissions, and he was hired by Yank, the Army Weekly, where he adapted his drawings of the misadventures of an army recruit into The Sad Sack. Drawn in pantomime, the strip became the magazine's most popular feature, as measured by the fan mail from servicemen who identified with the luckless private. In an official document, General George C. Marshall praised Sad Sack as a morale-booster for World War II troops. =Civilian life= At the end of the war, the U.S. Army created an advertising campaign with the phrase: \\"Don't be a Sad Sack, re-enlist in the Regular Army\\". Discharged from military service, Baker returned to live in Los Angeles where he transformed the Sad Sack army cartoon into a syndicated comic strip and a comic book series aimed at younger readers. While Baker gave the job of writing the comic narrative to others, he continued to illustrate the Sad Sack comic book covers until the time of his death. The Sad Sack radio program was broadcast in 1946. =Death and burial= George Baker is buried at Riverside National Cemetery, Riverside, California.

Directed by Peter Sasdy from a script by Anthony Hinds, it is the fifth installment in Hammer's Dracula series, and the fourth to star Christopher Lee as Count Dracula, the titular vampire. The film also features Geoffrey Keen and Gwen Watford. Taste the Blood of Dracula was released on a double bill alongside Crescendo, another Hammer production. It was followed by Scars of Dracula, also released in 1970. Plot A businessman named Weller is travelling through Eastern Europe when he is thrown from his carriage during a struggle and knocked unconscious. After regaining consciousness, he discovers it is night time. After wandering some way, he hears a deathly scream. Terrified, Weller runs and falls into a grassy slope. Looking up, he sees a caped figure screaming in agony with a large crucifix impaling him from the back. Weller watches in amazement and fear as the figure dies and disintegrates from blood to reddish dust. Examining the remains, Weller finds a ring, a cape and a brooch with dried blood on it. Dusting away the dried blood, Weller is petrified by the name on the brooch: Dracula. Some time later, three gentlemen—William Hargood, Samuel Paxton and Jonathon Secker—have formed a circle ostensibly devoted to charitable work but in reality they indulge themselves in brothels. One night they are intrigued by a young man who bursts into the brothel and is immediately tended to after snapping his fingers, despite the brothelkeeper's objections. The gentlemen are informed that he is Lord Courtley, who was disinherited by his father for celebrating a Black Mass years ago. Hoping for more intense pleasures, Hargood meets Courtley outside the brothel. The younger man takes the three to the Cafe Royal and promises them experiences they will never forget but insists that they go to see Weller and purchase from him Dracula's ring, cloak and dried blood. Having done so, the three meet with Courtley at an abandoned church for a ceremony during which he puts the dried blood into goblets and mixes it with drops of his own blood, telling the men to drink. They refuse, so he drinks the blood himself, screams and falls to the ground. As he grabs for Hargood's legs, all three gentlemen kick and beat him, not stopping until Courtley dies, at which they flee. While they return to their respective homes and their normal lives, Courtley's body, left in the abandoned church, transforms into Dracula, who vows that those who have destroyed his servant will be destroyed. Dracula begins his revenge with Hargood, who has begun to drink heavily and also treats his daughter Alice harshly, furious that she continues to see Paul, Paxton's son. Dracula takes control of Alice's mind via hypnosis and as her drunken father chases after her, she picks up a shovel and kills him. The next day, Hargood is found dead and Alice is missing. The police inspector in charge of the case refuses to investigate Alice's disappearance, citing a lack of time and resources. At her father's funeral, Alice hides behind bushes and attracts the attention of Paul's sister Lucy, telling her to meet her that night. They enter the abandoned church where Alice introduces her to a dark figure. Lucy assumes him to be Alice's lover but she is greeted by Dracula, who turns her into a vampire. With Hargood dead and Alice and Lucy missing, Paxton fears that Courtley is exacting revenge and, together with Secker, visits the abandoned church to check for Courtley's corpse. The body is missing but they discover Lucy asleep in a coffin with marks on her throat. Secker realizes she is a vampire and tries to stake her, but Paxton shoots him in the arm, forcing him to flee. While Secker stumbles his way home, Paxton weeps over his daughter's body. When he finally develops the courage to stake Lucy himself, she awakens, and Dracula appears. Alice pins Paxton down and Lucy drives a wooden stake through his chest. That night, Secker's son Jeremy sees Lucy, his fiancé, at his window, and comes down to see her. She sinks her fangs into his throat, enslaving him while Dracula watches. The vampire Jeremy then stabs his father on Lucy's orders. On the way back to the church, Lucy begs for Dracula's approval but instead he drains her dry and leaves her destroyed. Back at the church, he prepares to bite Alice but a cock crows and he returns to his coffin. Secker's body causes Jeremy's arrest. The police inspector assumes that he hated his father and stabbed him in a rage. Paul disagrees but the inspector refuses to listen. He hands Paul a letter - \\"the ramblings of a lunatic\\" he calls it - in which Secker instructs Paul on how to fight the vampires. Following Secker's instructions, Paul makes his way to the abandoned church. He finds Lucy's exsanguinated body en route, floating in a lake. At the church he bars the door with a large cross and clears the altar of Black Mass instruments, replacing them with the proper materials. He calls for Alice, who appears together with Dracula. Paul confronts Dracula with a cross but Alice, still entranced, disarms him. She seeks Dracula's approval but he dismisses her. He tries to leave but is prevented by the cross barring the door. His retreat is also barred by a cross which an angry and disappointed Alice threw to the floor. Dracula climbs the balcony and throws objects at Paul and Alice, before backing into a stained glass window depicting a cross. He breaks the glass but suddenly sees the changed surroundings and hears the Lord's Prayer recited in Latin. Dazzled and overwhelmed by the power of the newly re-sanctified church, Dracula falls to the altar, and dissolves back into bloody dust. With the vampire destroyed, Paul and Alice leave. Cast Production notes *Taste the Blood of Dracula was originally written without Dracula appearing at all. With Christopher Lee's increasing reluctance to reprise the role, Hammer intended to replace Lee and Dracula in the franchise with the Lord Courtley character played by Ralph Bates, who would rise as a vampire after his death and seek revenge on Hargood, Paxton, and Secker. Hammer's American distributor refused to release the film if it lacked an appearance by Dracula; this prompted Hammer to convince Lee to return, with Dracula replacing the resurrected Courtley. *The scenes of the gentlemen's visit to the local brothel were heavily edited on the film's original release. They are fully reinstated on the DVD release. *In its original United States release, it was rated GP (General audience, Parental guidance suggested—the forerunner to today's PG), but when it was re-released to DVD it was rated R for sexual content/nudity and brief violence. *An alternative version of the scene where Lucy bites Jeremy was filmed, with the young man actually becoming a vampire. This scene was not used, possibly to avoid complicating the plot further with the introduction of another vampire. Critical reception Variety wrote that director Peter Sasdy had directed his first feature film \\"effectively, leavening stock situations with the occasional shock twist, and has kept the Dracula pix atmosphere well.\\" The review noted that \\"Christopher Lee can now play Dracula in his sleep and, in this pic, looks occasionally as if he is doing so.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"absolutely routine Hammer horror, except that the script is even more laboured than usual. Dracula himself is virtually reduced to an onlooker while the happy families decimate each other at his behest, and the only moment of inspiration is when a would- be vampire stalker is himself staked by two gleeful vampires.\\" John C. Mahoney of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film was \\"superior in production, performance, story and atmosphere to the recent Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. In the title role, Christopher Lee seems to take new interest in the role with a terrifyingly bloodshot performance.\\"Mahoney, John C. (24 September 1970) \\"Double Helping of Horror\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 12. The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films called the film \\"the finest genuine Dracula sequel in the entire [Hammer Dracula] series.\\" It currently holds a positive 67% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews. Home media On 6 November 2007, the movie was released in a film pack along with Dracula, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, and Dracula A.D. 1972. On 6 October 2015, the movie was released in a Hammer collection pack on Blu-ray along with Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, and The Mummy.

He was born at Frimley, Surrey. He attended Yateley School across the county border at Yateley in Hampshire. Making his debut at the professional level for the Hampshire Cricket Board in 2001, he spent nine years playing for Hampshire, before being released by the county after the 2010 season. He is now playing club cricket for Wimbledon CC in the Surrey Championship Premier League whilst working as a financial planner at St James's Place Wealth Management. Early career Benham was first associated with Hampshire at the age of ten, becoming a product of the county's academy system. It was in the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy that he made his debut in List A cricket for the Hampshire Cricket Board against the Kent Cricket Board. During the match he was dismissed for a duck by Andy Tutt. Three years later, while attending Loughborough University, Benham made his first-class debut for Loughborough UCCE against Somerset. In 2004, he made three further first-class appearances for the Loughborough UCCE, as well as making his Hampshire debut in the County Championship against Derbyshire. On debut he made his maiden half century, scoring 74 runs. The following season he became more of a feature in the Hampshire side in the County Championship, but would have to wait until 2006 to make his List A debut for the county, which eventually came against Kent in the 2006 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. Known as an aggressive middle-order batsman, it was in the 2006 Pro40 that he recorded his maiden century and highest score in all formats during his time at Hampshire. He scored an unbeaten 158 in the Promotion/Relegation match against Glamorgan, helping Hampshire to a 151 run win and promotion to Division One. His performance won him praise from then Hampshire captain Shane Warne, with Warne tipping him as a possible future Hampshire captain. Benham did captain Hampshire, once in a first-class match in 2006 against Loughborough UCCE. At the end of the 2006 season, Benham was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award. Later career Benham and Nic Pothas build their winning partnership in the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final Following on from his success in the 2006 season, in which he averaged over 50, he had marked success on the pitch. In the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy he was a member of Hampshire's runner-up squad, although he did not feature in the final against Durham. Two years later he played a key role in the final of the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy against Sussex. He scored an unbeaten 37 and hit the winning runs as Hampshire won by 6 wickets at Lord's against Sussex. His innings was part of an unbeaten partnership of 67 with wicket-keeper Nic Pothas as Hampshire chased down their target of 220 to win the game. By the end of the 2009 season, he had played 54 one-day matches for Hampshire, scoring 1,564 runs at an average of 36.37, with a high score of 158. He converted his starts in this format more often, making four centuries and seven half centuries. In the first-class format he 2009 County Championship to recorded his first first-class century, making 111 against Loughborough UCCE, before following that up later in the season with a score of 100 against county champions Durham. The 2009 season was his best with the bat in the first-class format, scoring 316 runs and averaging 45.14.First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Chris Benham Come the 2010 County Championship, Benham started the season in the first-class starting XI, but throughout the season he failed to hold down a regular place in the team, due in part to the emergence of batsman James Vince. He did not feature in any one-day matches in 2010 and played just three Twenty20 fixtures, but was a member of Hampshire's 2010 Friends Provident t20 winning team. Come the end of the season, he had last featured in the County Championship in August against Yorkshire. This marked his final first-class match, by which since 2004 he had played in 45 fixtures, scoring 1,975 runs First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Chris Benham Release by Hampshire At the end of the 2010 season he was released by the county in October.Hampshire Cricket Part Company with Chris Benham Following his release, Benham has stated his desire to still play cricket at the highest level. On 1 March 2011 it was announced that Benham had signed for the Unicorns for the 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40.Benham and Thornely in Unicorns squad His debut for the Unicorns came in their first match of the competition against Lancashire, with Benham scoring a single run before being dismissed by Glen Chapple. After a couple of quiet games for the Unicorns, he scored his maiden half century for the team against Essex in May. Later in May he was offered a trial by Nottinghamshire, before playing for Wiltshire in Minor counties cricket. Benham did not feature in the Unicorns squad for the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40.

In Santa Claus mythology, the \\"workshop\\" is a sprawling commune located at the North Pole. The exact location of Santa's workshop varies depending upon local culture. There are at least eight known locations for his workshop.https://www.emailsanta.com/santa- claus-faq/where-does-santa-live.asp For example, believers in Canada send letters to Santa's Workshop at his North Pole location in Canada with the unique postal code of \\"H0H 0H0\\".https://canadianstampnews.com/holiday-mailing- deadlines-santa-letter- program/#:~:text=LETTERS%20TO%20SANTA&text;=Letters%20can%20be%20addressed%20to,should%20be%20mailed%20by%20Dec. Children in the U.K. and Finland tend to believe that Father Christmas's Workshop is located in Finland in Lapland. In addition to housing the factory where toys are either manufactured or distributed by the elves, the complex also houses the residence of Santa Claus, his wife, companions and all of the reindeer. Santa Claus grottos/department stores In the 20th century it became common during December in large shops or department stores to have a \\"cavern\\" in which an actor dressed up as Santa Claus would give gifts to children. Grottos can be large walk-through fantasy cavern-like areas incorporating animatronic characters such as elves and pantomime characters. This tradition started in Britain in 1879 and then extended in the 1890s to Australian and American department stores seeking to attract customers. The world's first Christmas grotto was in Lewis's Bon Marche Department Store in Liverpool, England. The grotto was opened in 1879, entitled \\"Christmas Fairyland\\". A staple of Liverpool's festive season, many generations first visited Father Christmas here, with the final displays covering over . The Grotto has now moved to St. Johns Market, St. Johns Shopping Centre (Liverpool, UK), after being saved by Entrepreneur Guy Fennell in 2017. The Grotto now runs by the name 'Liverpool's Famous Grotto'. Shopping malls have also setup interactive exhibits. In Adelaide, South Australia, the first \\"Magic Cave\\" was set up in 1896 at the John Martin's department store on Rundle Street. An annual store-sponsored parade, the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, was initiated in 1933 during which Father Christmas was conducted to the Magic Cave to formally herald the holiday season. Since the closure of John Martin's, the David Jones stores, have continued the tradition of the Magic Cave but nowhere near to the extent John Martin's did, in Adelaide as well as in other Australian capitals while the annual South Australia parade marked its 75th anniversary in 2007. Nowadays department stores and shopping centres in the UK still host Santa's Grottos. It is traditional that the children receive a toy from Father Christmas upon visiting his Grotto be it in a shopping mall or a little garden centre. Grottos are sometimes free and sometimes they charge parents to let their kids see Santa and receive a surprise gift. Reproductions A themed attraction in Santa Claus, Indiana, named Santa's Candy Castle emulates the traditional depiction of Santa's workshop. There is also a Santa's Workshop amusement park in North Pole, New York. The world's oldest theme park, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari was known as \\"Santa Claus Land\\" prior to 1984 and is in Santa Claus, Indiana as well. Location In 1879, Thomas Nast revealed to the world in a series of drawings that Santa's workshop is at the North Pole (specifically the North Magnetic Pole, due to the aurora borealis being centered on it and the fact that the workshop was on land, properties that at the time described the magnetic pole [which was under the Canadian Arctic Archipelago at the time; the magnetic pole has since drifted off to sea] but not the geographic one). The Canada Post postal code for the workshop is H0H 0H0. The United States Postal Service recommends mail to Santa's workshop be sent to Santa Claus 1225 Reindeer Rd. North Pole, AK 99705.Volunteer elves respond to every letter sent to town of Santa Claus, Indiana Each Nordic country also claims Santa's workshop to be located on their territories. Norway claims he lives in Drøbak. In Denmark, he is said to live in Greenland (near Uummannaq). In Sweden, the town of Mora has a theme park named \\"Santaworld\\". The national postal terminal in Tomteboda in Stockholm receives children's letters for Santa. In Finland, Korvatunturi has long been known as Santa's home, and two theme parks, Santa Claus Village and Santa Park are located at the Arctic Circle in the municipality of Rovaniemi.

Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 89, Cypress, CA, 2013. .http://www.roadandtrack.com/car- culture/classic-cars/a26081/lost-art-the-english-wheel/ Description The process of using an English wheel is known as wheeling. Panels produced this way are expensive, due to the highly skilled and labour-intensive production method, but it has the key advantage that it can flexibly produce different panels using the same machine. It is a forming machine that works by surface stretching and is related in action to panel beating processes. It is used wherever low volumes of compound curved panels are required; typically in coachbuilding, car restoration, spaceframe chassis racing cars that meet regulations that require sheetmetal panels resembling mass production vehicles (NASCAR),http://www.englishwheels.net/1.html?sm=33189http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto- racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar2.htm How NASCAR Race Cars Work - Howstuffworks.com car prototypes and aircraft skin components. English wheel production is at its highest in low-volume sports car production, particularly when more easily formed aluminium alloy is used. Where high-volume production runs of panels are required, the wheel is replaced by a stamping press that has a much higher capital setup cost and longer development time than using an English wheel, but each panel in the production run can be produced in a matter of seconds. This cost is defrayed across a larger production run, but a stamping press is limited to only one model of panel per set of dies. The English wheel model shown is manually operated, but when used on thicker sheet metals such as for ship hulls the machine may be powered and much larger than the one shown here. Construction The machine is shaped like a large, closed letter \\"C\\". At the ends of the C, there are two wheels. The wheel on the top is called the rolling wheel, while the wheel on the bottom is called the anvil wheel. (Some references refer to the wheels by their position: upper wheel and lower wheel.) The anvil wheel usually has a smaller radius than the rolling wheel. Although larger machines exist, the rolling wheel is usually wide or less, and usually in diameter, or less. The rolling (top) wheel is flat in cross section, while the anvil (bottom) wheel is domed. The depth of the C-shaped frame is called the throat. The largest machines have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and is supported by a frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the machine and work easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the top wheel and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the machine works by an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle of the frame that holds the anvil roller is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must adjust the pressure to compensate. Frame designs are the most significant element of this simple device. For the most part wheels have changed very little since the 19th century. The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had Babbitt metal plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8” steel. Despite the advantages of cast iron, it has less than half the stiffness (Young's modulus) of steel and sometimes must be replaced by steel when a stiffer frame is needed. Steel frames made of solid flame-cut plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs. Steel tubing, generally of square section, has been used for wheeling machine frames during the past 30 years, in the US particularly, where sheet metal shaping has become a hobby as well as a business. Tube-framed machines are reasonably priced and are available as kit-built machines or can be built easily from plans. The stiffest tubular frames have a fully triangulated external bracing truss. They are most effective on thinner or softer materials, such as 20 ga steel or .063\\" aluminum. White, Kent. \\"Rolling Along with the Wheel.\\" Home Shop Machinist Magazine, Issue: Vol. 27 No. 5, Sept-Oct 2008. Cast frame machines, like the one pictured, are still available. A properly equipped machine has an assortment of anvil wheels. Anvil wheels, like dollies used with hammers in panel beating (which are also known as anvils) should be used to match the desired crown or curvature of the work piece. Operation The operator of the machine passes the sheet metal between the anvil wheel and the rolling wheel. This process stretches the material and causes it to become thinner. As the material stretches, it forms a convex surface over the anvil wheel.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 89, Cypress, CA, 2013. . This surface is known as \\"crown\\". A high crown surface is very curved, a low crown surface is slightly curved. The rigidity and strength in the surface of a workpiece is provided by the high crown areas. The radius of the surface, after working, depends on the degree that the metal in the middle of the work piece stretches relative to the edge of the piece. If the middle stretches too much, the operator can recover the shape by wheeling the edge of the piece. Wheeling the edge has the same effect in correcting mis-shape due to over-stretching in the middle, as does shrinking directly on the overstretched area by the use of heat shrinking or Eckold-type shrinking. This is because the edge holds the shape in place. Shrinking the edge prior to wheeling aids the formation of shape during wheeling, and reduces the amount of stretching and thinning needed to reach the final shape. Shrinking processes reduce the surface area by thickening the sheet metal. Shrinking by hand is harder to do and slower than stretching using panel beating tools or wheeling, because of this it should only be used when absolutely necessary. Aluminium sheet should be annealed before wheeling because rolling at the mill during its production work hardens it. Strength and rigidity is also provided by the edge treatment such as flanging or wiring, after the fabrication of the correct surface contour has been achieved. The flange is so important to the shape of the finished surface that it is possible to fabricate some panels by shrinking and stretching of the flange alone, without the use of surface stretching. =Adjustment= The pressure of the contact area, which varies with the radius of the dome on the anvil wheel and the pressure of the adjusting screw, and the number of wheeling passes determines the degree to which the material stretches. Some operators prefer a foot adjuster so they can maintain constant pressure over varying sheet metal thickness for smoothing, with both hands free to manipulate the work piece. This style of adjuster is also helpful for blending the edge of high crown areas that are thinner, with low crown areas that are relatively unstretched. A drawback of the foot adjuster is that it can get in the way of very longitudinally curved panels, such as the cycle type mudguards (wings/fenders) used on motorcycles, pre-WW2 sports cars, and current open- wheeled cars like the Lotus / Caterham 7. To address this problem, some wheeling machines have a hand adjuster close beneath the anvil yoke (also known a wheel holder) so such panels can curve underneath unobstructed. This type of machine typically has a diagonal lower 'C' shaped frame that curves lower to the floor, with a hand-operated adjuster close to the anvil wheel holder, instead of the horizontal and long vertical hand adjuster shown in the above picture. A third type of adjuster moves the top wheel up and down with the bottom anvil wheel left static. =Shaping= At every fabrication stage, the operator must constantly reference the shape that they want to reproduce. This may involve the use of template paper, section templates (made using paper or thin sheet metal), station bucks, formers, profile gauges, profile templates and of course an original panel. Wheeling machines that feature a quick-release lever, which enables the operator to drop the anvil wheel away from the upper wheel so the work piece can be removed and inserted quickly without losing the pressure setting, are great time savers during this part of the process. The operator must have painstaking patience to make many passes over an area on the sheet to form the area correctly. They may make additional passes with different wheels and in different directions (at 90 degrees for a simple double curvature shape, for example) to achieve the desired shape. Using the correct pressure and appropriate anvil wheel shape, and accurate close patterns of overlapping wheeling passes (or actually overlapping with low crown anvils) makes using the machine something of an art. Too much pressure produces a part that is undulating, marred, and stressed—while too little pressure makes the job take a long time. Localised wheeling on one part of the panel is likely to cause mis-shaping in adjacent areas. Raising or stretching an area causes adjacent areas to sink, and correcting that may affect areas further away from the original panel working. This is because the tensions in the panel caused by stretching affect the panel shape further away than might be imagined. This means the operator must work over a large area of the panel, fixing these side effects while causing more side effects that must also be fixed. Key to producing the right shape is to have the right amount of stretched metal surface over this wider area. If this is achieved, it is possible to \\"move\\" the metal with minimal extra stretching, filling the low spots with metal from the high spots. This smoothing is almost like planishing using a moderate pressure setting, but is still heavier than that used for planishing. It is a time consuming and fiddly iterative process, that is one of the most difficult and skillful parts of wheeling. As the size of the panel/section increases, the work involved and the level of difficulty increases disproportionately. This is also a reason that very large panels can be very difficult to do and are made in sections. High crown panels/sections may need to be annealed due to work-hardening of the metal, which makes it brittle unworkable and liable to fracture. After achieving the correct basic shape with the correct amount of metal in the right places, the worker must blend the edges of high crown areas with low crown areas, so that the surface contour transitions from one to the other smoothly. After this, the final wheeling stage involves very light pressure wheeling to planish the surface to make it a smooth, cohesive shape. This stage does not stretch the metal but moves the already stretched metal around, so using the minimum anvil pressure and as wide an anvil as is possible with the panel shape, is essential. Typically, only small high crown panels, (such as repair sections) or large low crown panels (such as roofs), are made in one piece. Large low crown panels need two skilled craftsmen to support the weight of the panel. =Limitations= Five key limitations of the machine are: *The thickness of the sheet that the machine can handle *Fitting the work piece in the 'throat' depth of the machine *The size of work piece that the operator/s can physically handle *The risk of over stretching/thinning an over-large high crown panel or section (It is no good having the correct contour if the metal is too thin and weak.) *As the size of the panel or section increases, the work involved and the level of difficulty increases disproportionately These limitations are the reasons why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. Oxy-acetylene welding joints don't have this drawback, provided they are allowed to cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without filler rod (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly. =Finishing= The final panel fabrication process, after achieving the correct surface contour, is some kind of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or wire edging. This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is too much or too little metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat shrinking or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the flange, (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability. An English wheel is a better tool for a skilled craftsman for low-crown applications than manually hammering. Planishing manually using dollies and slapper files or planishing hammer, after hammer forming is very labour-intensive. Using a pear shaped mallet and sandbag to stretch the sheet metal (sinking), or by raising on a stake, speeds up the fabrication of higher crown sections. (A stake is a dolly, that can be much larger than hand held dollys, typically with a tapering square cross section casting underneath it. This is to mount it in a bench vice or a matching female hole in a beak anvil as used by blacksmiths and farriers.) A pneumatic hammer or power hammer is faster still. The English wheel is very effective when used for planishing, (for which it was originally patented in England), to a smooth final finish after these processes.

Latex rubber is used in many types of clothing. Rubber has traditionally been used in protective clothing, including gas masks and Wellington boots. Rubber is now generally being replaced in these application by plastics. Mackintoshes have traditionally been made from rubberized cloth. Latex rubber as a clothing material is common in fetish fashion and among BDSM practitioners, and is often seen worn at fetish clubs. Latex is sometimes also used by couturiers for its dramatic appearance. Latex clothing tends to be skin-tight. There are several magazines dedicated to the use and wearing of it. Less commonly, latex clothing can be loose-fitting. Design and manufacture A fetish model and dominatrix wearing pasties and fetish fashion themed latex dress at Exxxotica, USA. The poster beside her reads \\"hardcore latex\\". There are a handful of companies around the world which manufacture latex rated as suitable for contact with human skin. These firms supply sheet (in the vast majority) to a larger number of smaller fashion clothing companies. In the past, some marketplaces suffered from de facto monopoly supply conditions, where a sheet supplier could impose restrictive ordering requirements. Only being able to order half-kilometre long batches of sheet in the colour and thickness they wanted, meant that designers and clothing producers often had to co-operate, or face long delays in supplying their customers, if they wanted to be in the rubber clothing business. Since 2000, however, the sheet market has been exposed to competition courtesy of the Internet. This has produced an explosion in cottage industry scale latex fetish clothing manufacturers. Latex sheet-based clothing is constructed by a three-stage process. First a pattern for a specific garment is selected, and adjusted carefully to suit the measurements supplied by the customer. Then the sheet latex is cut out on a flat board, by hand: lastly latex glue (generally rubber cement solvent-based adhesives) is used to join seams together. Skilled latex makers can build a stocking, shaped to match the contours of a specific person's leg, made from latex only 0.2 mm thick, in under an hour. It is possible to use water-based glues such as Copydex to make latex clothes; however, the long-term durability of items made this way is somewhat dubious. Latex moulded clothing is produced by dipping a mould into a vat of liquid rubber. Dealing with raw liquid latex is more difficult because of the extra effort that must be put in to keep the thickness of the latex itself consistent. Because of this, improper molding techniques can lead to inconsistent thickness in the latex, causing it to fail at the weak points faster than items made from sheet latex. This has led to a major stigma against molded latex garments, in favor of sheet latex versions. Unfortunately, this stigma has been detrimental to those few latex providers who have proper mold-making techniques. When done properly, a molded latex garment is just as durable as sheet latex, and it is a preferred method for skilled individuals making items with heavy contours like hoods or gloves. Despite any attempt to use sheet latex to make hoods and gloves, it is impossible to get solid sheets to fit complex contours as well as a molded latex item can. The belief that all sheet latex is superior to all molded latex is completely false, and ultimately it depends on the abilities of the creator, as even poorly made sheet latex can fall apart easily. Sheet latex is the preferred method for items like catsuits, that do not need such perfect form fitting, and are easier to create with sheets compared to the large molds required for body suits. While there is little difference in latex clothing made from liquid latex versus sheet latex in the hands of a skilled artisan, liquid latex is cured via air drying while sheet latex is cured by being vulcanized. This makes the two forms slightly different. Due to the difference in curing, liquid latex can be applied to sheet latex clothing to add unique patterns and designs which can be peeled off the sheet latex afterwards. Neither moulded, nor sheet-based, latex is amenable to large-scale mass production. Skilled manual artistry is an integral part of the process; this means that made-to-measure and special designs are much more accessible to the general buyer, in looking at fetish latex, than is the case with regular textiles.  Use in clothing  Latex has been used to make leotards, bodysuits, stockings and gloves, besides other garments. Latex is also often used to make specialist fetishistic garments like hoods and rubber cloaks. Latex clothing is generally made from large sheets of latex which are delivered in rolls. The \\"classic\\" colour for fetishistic latex clothing is black, but latex is naturally translucent and may be dyed any colour, including metallic shades or white. It can come in thicknesses which generally range from about 0.18 mm to 0.5 mm. Instead of being sewn, latex clothing is generally glued along its seams. Because latex sheet is relatively weak, latex clothing needs special care to avoid tearing. While latex can be repaired using materials similar to those provided in a bicycle repair kit, the result is rarely as attractive as the original appearance of the garment. Latex clothing is often polished to preserve and improve its shiny appearance. Putting on latex clothing can be difficult, because latex has high friction against dry skin. To make it easier to put on, wearers often use talc to reduce friction against the skin when putting the clothes on; then, because stray talc is very visible against the rubber, wearers generally polish off any visible talc. Another method of dressing is using lubricant (or 'lube') which provides a slippery surface for the latex to glide over. A third method of reducing or eliminating the high friction of latex when dressing is to chlorinate the rubber. Chlorine in gaseous form is generated by the reaction of hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite. This chlorine bonds to the first few molecules on the surface of the isoprene (latex) and transforms them into neoprene. This process affects metallic colours, but does not affect strength. Latex may also be painted directly onto the body as latex in liquid form, which is also sometimes used to close seams in the creation of latex clothing. Removal of a painted on liquid latex garment can result in painful hair removal. Wearers avoid this by preparing the skin by prior hair removal, the use of release agents to prevent the latex adhering to the hair, or using products such as orange oil to weaken the latex during removal. Use of latex clothing has been popularized by media appearances, such as the outfit of Catwoman, a cat burglar, in Batman Returns or the outfits in The Matrix which are mostly made of latex, like popular celebrities Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, Kylie Jenner, Pamela Anderson, Shania Twain, Eliza Dushku, and Emma Watson has worn latex in publicity events or hangouts.  Use in fetish community  A woman in a tight black latex catsuit. Latex clothing is a popular feature of the BDSM community. Latex or rubber fetishists sometimes refer to themselves as \\"rubberists\\". One reason why latex or other tight shiny fabrics may be fetishised is perhaps that the garment forms a \\"second skin\\" that acts as a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. Thus, wearers of skin-tight latex or PVC garments may be perceived by the viewer as being naked, or simply coated in a shiny substance like paint. Latex can also be polished to be shiny and can also be produced in bright colours, adding further visual stimulus to add to the physical sensations produced by the material. The tightness of the garments may also be viewed as a kind of sexual bondage.

Beginning in 1962, the Model 147 was introduced as a reconnaissance RPV (Remotely Piloted Vehicle, nomenclature of that era) for a United States Air Force project named Fire Fly. Over the next decade — assisted with secret funding from the recently formed National Reconnaissance Office along with support of the Strategic Air Command and Ryan Aeronautical's own resources — the basic Model 147 design would be developed into a diverse series of variants configured for a wide array of mission- specific roles, with multiple new systems, sensors and payloads used, modified and improved upon during the operational deployment of these drones in Southeast Asia. Missions performed by the Model 147 series RPVs included high- and low-altitude photographic and electronic aerial reconnaissance, surveillance, decoy, electronic warfare, signals intelligence, and psychological warfare. The Ryan drones were designed without landing gear for simplicity and to save weight. Like its Firebee predecessor, the Model 147 could either be air-launched from a larger carrier aircraft or launched from the ground using a solid rocket booster; at completion of its mission the drone deployed its own recovery parachute which could be snatched in mid-air by a recovery helicopter (in a combat environment it was naturally not desired to recover the drone on, from or near enemy territory and ground or water impact could also cause damage to or loss of the drone or its payload). At the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 the U.S. military's available funding and need for combat drones severely declined, even as Teledyne Ryan introduced further advanced developments of the Model 147 series such as the BGM-34 strike and defense suppression RPVs. Costs of maintaining the Lightning Bugs at full readiness could no longer be justified. Only by the 1990s did substantial interest, organization and funding again emerge from the U.S. Air Force and intelligence agencies to develop, acquire and widely deploy combat UAVs. Development =Ryan Model 136 Red Wagon and Lucy Lee= In 1959, Ryan Aeronautical performed a study to investigate how the company's Firebee target drone could be used for long-range reconnaissance missions. Ryan engineers concluded they could increase the Firebee's range to allow it to fly south over the Soviet Union after launch from the Barents Sea, with recovery in Turkey. The Firebee has a low radar cross-section, making it hard to detect. With lengthened wings, the drone would also be able to fly at high altitude, further increasing its elusiveness. It could be launched by a Lockheed DC-130, or JATO-boosted from a land site or ship. Ryan presented its report on the studies to the U.S. Air Force in mid-April 1960. On 1 May 1960 an American Lockheed U-2 spy plane was shot down over the USSR and its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured. On 1 July a Boeing RB-47H reconnaissance aircraft flying an electronic intelligence mission in international airspace near the Soviet border was shot down; four of its crew were killed and the other two captured. A few days later, the Air Force awarded Ryan a US$200,000 contract to perform further studies. Ryan Aeronautical company artist's concept rendering of the \\"Lucy Lee\\" high-altitude reconnaissance drone proposal, circa 1961. Ryan conducted radar measurements on sub-scale Firebee models and determined that their radar signature could be reduced by placing a wire screen over the jet intake, painting parts of the drone with non-conductive paint, and placing radar-absorbent material pads on both sides of the fuselage. Test flights of the modified Firebees were performed in September and October 1961. Flights were given a cover story, describing the drones as high-altitude targets for surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) in case one of them came down in a public area. The flights demonstrated that the modifications did not compromise the Firebee's performance. Ryan actually wanted to build a completely new drone, the Ryan Model 136, for the reconnaissance mission. The Model 136, or Red Wagon, was optimized for the role with long straight wings for high-altitude flight, an engine set on the back of the fuselage to reduce its radar and infrared signatures as seen from below, and inward-canted twin tail fins to conceal the exhaust plume. The project stalled, however as the incoming Kennedy Administration was certain to reassess many military projects and Red Wagon was put on hold. Ryan then proposed another drone project named \\"Lucy Lee\\" consisting of a highly modified Firebee intended to perform photographic and signals intelligence (SIGINT) reconnaissance from outside Soviet airspace. Lucy Lee seemed to be on track, but was then abruptly cancelled in January 1962. =Ryan Model 147A Fire Fly= Just as the whole idea of reconnaissance drones seemed to be completely dead, the USAF came to rescue the program. The Air Force selected the cheapest option, a reconnaissance drone based on a Firebee with minimal changes. A US$1.1 million contract was issued on 2 February 1962, requesting four Firebee drones modified for aerial reconnaissance. The modified Firebees were funded from a program named \\"Big Safari\\", established in the 1950s to fund fast-track conversions of existing aircraft for the reconnaissance mission. Big Safari would continue to work on reconnaissance drones during the Vietnam War, and would also assist UAV programs in later wars. The new reconnaissance drones were designated Model 147A and codenamed Fire Fly. Specifications dictated a 1,200 mile (1,930 kilometre) range and a cruise altitude of . The first Model 147A was a standard Firebee with a new guidance system consisting of no more than a timer-programmer, a gyrocompass, and an altimeter. The Fire Fly could be programmed to fly in a certain direction at a certain altitude for a certain time, and then turn around and return the way it came. This aircraft was intended only as a demonstrator and to evaluate the new guidance system; it carried no cameras. Three test flights were performed in April 1962 and demonstrated the validity of the concept, with the drone performing a mission which ranged from New Mexico, north into Utah, and then back again with no guidance from the ground (though accompanied by a B-57 chase plane). The second Model 147A had an \\"plug\\" inserted into the fuselage to carry an additional 68 US gallons (258 litres) of fuel, increasing overall length from to . It also had a new nose containing a camera from the U-2. After four successful test flights performed in April and early May 1962, the third and fourth Model 147As (which were almost identical to the second example) were declared operational and deployed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico with a Lockheed DC-130 Hercules launch aircraft. Tests conducted that summer showed the drone was almost invisible to ground radar, and interceptors that were scrambled to find it ended up chasing each other. The only problem was that the drone generated a contrail, which gave it away. A \\"no-con\\" (no- contrail) program was initiated to fix the problem in subsequent variants, though apparently it wasn't fitted to the Model 147A. The system injected chlorosulfonic acid into the engine tailpipe when the drone entered hostile territory, creating tiny ice crystals which formed a transparent contrail. An effective system, although the chlorosulfonic acid was very corrosive which required use of high-grade stainless steel plumbing. During the Cuban Missile Crisis a U-2 was shot down over Cuba on 27 October 1962 by an SA-2 and its pilot killed. Afterwards the Model 147As were authorized for reconnaissance missions in place of the U-2. The drones were mounted under the wings of their DC-130 Hercules controller aircraft, its propellers turning, at ready on the runway when notification came from Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay that the mission was scrubbed. The U-2s were used for reconnaissance over Cuba instead, with missions resuming on 5 November 1962. LeMay wanted to reserve the Fire Fly for later. =Ryan Model 147B, 147C and 147D Lightning Bug= Ryan Model 147B high-altitude reconnaissance RPV under wing of a DC-130A launch aircraft. Although the Fire Fly had yet to be used operationally, the Air Force was enthusiastic enough about the concept to issue contracts for follow-on variants. The USAF ordered nine Model 147Bs, including two prototypes and seven production aircraft. The Model 147B was designed for high-altitude reconnaissance, with wingspan extended from the span of the Model 147A to , raising the 147B's operational ceiling to . The delivery schedule for the high-altitude Model 147B was several months out, so the Air Force also ordered seven Model 147Cs, a production version of the 147A, as an interim solution. The Model 147C had a wingspan extended to , and incorporated the no-contrail system. Three of this batch of Model 147Cs were modified to become special-purpose Model 147Ds. The 147D combined the functions of reconnaissance and the original Firebee mission of aerial target: it was to be used as bait for SA-2 SAMs to obtain data on signals associated with the SA-2. The SAM was targeted by a radar codenamed Fan Song and it was simple enough to pick up its signals with a normal SIGINT aircraft. The SA-2 was also radio- controlled to the target by a ground command guidance link, with the missile carrying a transponder that sent back a signal to the Fan Song radar to allow tracking. Picking up these radio command signals was hazardous, since they only came on when a missile was launched. The proximity fuze signal was the most dangerous because it would only be detected moments before the SAM detonated. A special \\"SAM sniffer\\" Radar MASINT payload was installed on the Fire Fly to pick up these signals, with the drone relaying the data to an ERB-47H electronic warfare aircraft. An active radar enhancement device was installed to encourage the enemy to take shots at the drone. The three Model 147Ds were delivered in December 1962. The Fire Fly code name had leaked in the meantime, so the new drones were given the codename Lightning Bug. In July 1963, the Lightning Bugs reached full operational status, though they had yet to fly an operational mission. In late December 1963, the Air Force ordered fourteen more Model 147Bs. By this time Fidel Castro was threatening to shoot down U-2s flying over Cuba, and a May 1964 study concluded that the Lightning Bug was the best alternative. After information about the proposal leaked to the press, the U.S. administration decided to back up the U-2s with the Lockheed A-12, precursor of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. While the fledgling Ryan Model 147 drones had thus far played only backstage roles, U.S. relations with China and North Korea and events in Southeast Asia would significantly ramp up their operational involvement in the next decade. Ryan Aeronautical's engineering expertise and feedback from the USAF's operational experience with the drones would also cause them be continually modified, redesigned and optimized for better performance, and further developed to take on an array of new missions. During this time operational deployment of Model 147 drones would be undertaken by the Air Force's Strategic Air Command and its reconnaissance wings, equipped with DC-130 launch aircraft and recovery helicopters. Continued behind the scenes support from the National Reconnaissance Office, which had allocated project funds from its outset via the classified Program D for developing airborne intelligence collection platforms, also ensured that the Lightning Bug project would grow into a full- fledged aerial reconnaissance program. Operational history =China overflights= The Lightning Bugs remained a potentially valuable reconnaissance asset. The first opportunity for operational use came in August 1964. On 2 August, the destroyer USS Maddox was sailing in international waters off the North Vietnamese coast when it was allegedly attacked by three North Vietnamese PT boats in what is known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which became a pretext for a major expansion of U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam. The Johnson Administration feared Communist ChineseUrdang, p. 1105 intervention in the widening war, and decided to use the Lightning Bugs to monitor Chinese activities. The drones were sent with their DC-130 director aircraft to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa to conduct overflights of southern China. The first Lightning Bug mission took place on 20 August 1964, though there were problems. The DC-130 controlling the mission was loaded with a pair of Model 147Bs. One drone failed to launch, and was later lost when it fell off its underwing pylon. The second 147B successfully completed its mission over China, flew back to Taiwan, deployed its parachute and splashed down in a rice paddy. The drone, however was dragged over the ground by the parachute which badly damaged the machine. Its film payload was recovered intact and although the drone's navigation hadn't been as accurate as hoped, images of several primary targets were recovered. A total of five Lightning Bug missions were performed over China into early September 1964, with only two of them successful. The Nationalist Chinese, however were very enthusiastic about the Lightning Bugs. They had been flying U-2 spy planes over mainland China on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency and were experiencing increased losses from SA-2 SAMs. =Lightning Bugs in combat, 1964-1965= To expand reconnaissance flights to North Vietnam, in early October 1964 these operations were shifted to Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. The first Lightning Bug mission flown from Bien Hoa took place on 11 October 1964. Increasing numbers of Model 147B missions were flown over North Vietnam and southern China, with a total of 20 reconnaissance drone flights in 1964. The flights were controlled by the Strategic Air Command (SAC) from Monkey Mountain Facility in South Vietnam. The controller was stationed at Bien Hoa and the support staff was located at Da Nang Air Base, consisting of two SAC Single Sideband Operators, SSgt Willie V Collier nicknamed \\"Willie VC\\" and SSgt Walter J Dawson from the 46th Comm Gp Barksdale AFB. The Chinese were extremely eager to shoot the drones down and managed to destroy one on November 15, 1964. Lightning Bug overflights continued and so did Chinese efforts to intercept them. The Chinese succeeded in destroying five drones by mid-April, and on 20 April 1965 put the wrecks of three of them on public display. With every shoot-down, the Chinese issued verbose press reports praising China's \\"great victory\\" in shooting down \\"reconnaissance planes of the imperialist United States.\\" Although self-destruct charges were considered for installation on overflight Lightning Bugs it was finally decided not to, and the United States simply adopted a policy of \\"no comment\\" when asked about the reconnaissance drones. With no American crews lost in the shoot-downs, the U.S. press paid very little attention to the Chinese reports. =Ryan Model 147G= The Air Force had enthusiastically embraced the Lightning Bug and was trying to refine the type, working with Ryan to obtain an improved version of the high-altitude Model 147B, designated the Model 147G. The Model 147G featured a more powerful Continental J69-T-41A turbojet, with 1,920 pounds of thrust (871 kgp), replacing the J69-T-29A used in its predecessors, and a fuselage stretched to , to accommodate more fuel. The no-con system was also installed. The first 147G was delivered to the USAF in July 1965. By this time U-2 overflights of defended airspace had been phased out, with that mission left to the Lightning Bugs. The Model 147G performed its first mission in October 1965, and the Model 147B flew its last mission that December. =Ryan Model 147J= High-altitude reconnaissance over North Vietnam proved somewhat impractical. During the monsoon season, from November through March, the skies were mostly overcast, and even in fair weather smoke or ground haze could obscure reconnaissance targets. For this reason, the Air Force decided to develop a low-altitude version of the Lightning Bug. In October 1965, the service issued a contract to Ryan to develop the Model 147J, a fast-track modification of the Model 147G with a low-altitude navigation system. Low- altitude flight was more demanding than high-altitude flight, since there were many more things to run into, and a number of Model 147J drones were lost in development. =Ryan Model 147E= Among the 77 missions flown by the drones in 1965 were three flights by a special SIGINT modification of the Model 147B, designated the Model 147E, another \\"SAM sniffer\\" variant. Three Model 147Es were sent to South Vietnam in October 1965 as part of a program codenamed UNITED EFFORT. The SIGINT packages failed on all three initial missions, and the Model 147Es were sent back to the U.S. for environmental tests to track down the problem; it turned out that the SIGINT package failed when overheated. The problem was corrected and the Model 147Es were sent back to the combat zone. On 13 February 1966 — the fourth Model 147E mission — the drone was destroyed by an SA-2, but not before it relayed the vital signal data. The U.S. had been desperate to get this data ever since the deployment of the SA-2, and officials claimed that this single flight justified the entire Model 147 program. The information was immediately put to use to develop a simple warning system that would tell the pilot when an SA-2 command signal was turned on, meaning a missile launch was imminent; this device would go into production as the AN/APR-26. =Ryan Model 147F= Another box, the AN/ALQ-51 \\"Shoe Horn\\", had been developed to help deal with the Fan Song radar. The AN/ALQ-51 was a \\"deception jammer\\", meaning it manipulated the radar signals to mislead the radar into thinking the target was somewhere other than its actual location. Since the Americans hadn't actually got their hands on a Fan Song at the time, the box had been tested in the U.S. against a radar simulating a Fan Song. The jammer worked well in tests, but fielding it without sending it up against a real Fan Song was out of the question. The Model 147 was then used to operationally test the box. A single Model 147B was fitted with the package and redesignated Model 147F, flying a number of missions in July 1966. It was finally lost after almost a dozen SA-2s had been fired at it. =Ryan Model 147N= A primary virtue of the Lightning Bugs was that they were far more expendable than piloted reconnaissance aircraft; but by early 1966 an average of four out of five Lightning Bugs failed to return from missions. This loss rate was unacceptable even for a relatively cheap drone, and the Air Force asked Ryan to quickly convert ten standard Firebee target drones to expendable decoys. They were fitted with traveling-wave tube (TWT) active radar enhancement devices to make them look like a bigger aircraft on radar. There were no provisions for recovery or long-range fuel capacity, since their missions were to be one-way only. The decoys were designated Model 147N, with the first mission performed by one alongside a Model 147G on March 3, 1966. The two drones followed a parallel path until they reached the target area, where they diverged. North Vietnamese air defenses tracked the \\"brighter\\" 147N instead of the 147G, which was recovered. As an added bonus the 147Ns resulted in a few \\"kills\\" of North Vietnamese fighter aircraft. One fighter ran out of fuel when the pilot chased the drone out to sea, and other fighters were lost due to \\"friendly fire\\" accidents while hunting the drones. The decoys worked so well that the Air Force ordered another batch of ten with a few minor improvements, and designated them Model 147NX. The initial Model 147Ns had been programmed to turn back and head for home in order to simulate a normal operational drone flight profile, and a few of them surprisingly did make it back even with their limited fuel supply. They crashed since they were not designed to be recovered, but the recovery system was not expensive and so the Model 147NX was fitted with recovery parachutes and gear as well as a cheap camera. If the decoy survived the mission, it might provide useful intelligence. =Lightning Bugs over Southeast Asia 1966= By March 1966 the low-altitude Model 147J was ready for operational service; it featured a \\"barometric altitude control system\\" (BLACS), a dual camera payload featuring a front-to-back scan camera, a side- to-side scan camera and a new paint job. The high-altitude Lightning Bugs had been painted black which is a high-visibility color at low altitude. Model 147Js were painted gray on top and white underneath. The fast-moving 147J drones streaked low over the ground, making them difficult targets and increasing their odds of returning from a mission. Up to that time the drones had parachuted to the ground when they returned, but were often damaged by the impact; the USAF then came up with a retrieval method using a big Sikorsky CH-3E helicopter that snagged the parachute in mid-air and winched it in. Mid- air retrieval proved effective, with an eventual 2,655 successful recoveries in 2,745 attempts. A total of 105 drone missions were flown over North Vietnam and Communist China in 1966. Most of these were 147G flights, along with some 147Js, as well as the 147E and 147F SIGINT missions and the 147N and 147NX decoys. One of the 147Js actually took a picture of an SA-2 SAM streaking past it. =Ryan Model 147NP, 147NRE and 147NQ= The Air Force was very pleased with the low-altitude Model 147J and feared there would not be enough of them to keep up with operational attrition. Some Model 147Gs were modified to the 147J configuration, but the USAF also asked Ryan to come up with a new low- altitude reconnaissance drone on a fast track. The new variant was the Model 147NP, which was derived from the initial Model 147A. The Model 147NP had the older J69-T-29A engine and a wingspan, plus a fuselage stretched to . While Ryan was working on the Model 147NP, the Air Force also came forward with an urgent requirement for a low-altitude night reconnaissance drone. Four Model 147NPs were pulled from production and modified as Model 147NREs, where \\"NRE\\" stood for \\"night reconnaissance electronic\\". The Model 147NREs had a dual- camera payload synchronized to a bright white strobe light fitted into the drone's belly. The strobe lit up the sky when it went off. Both the 147NREs and 147NPs went into action in Vietnam in spring of 1967. The first 147NRE mission was in late May, with the first 147NP mission following a week later. The Model 147NREs were painted black as appropriate to their night mission, while the Model 147NPs were painted in jungle camouflage colors. The Model 147NPs performed as desired, but the Model 147NREs did not quite meet expectations. The \\"footprint\\" of the strobe light was fairly small, and the drone's navigation system lacked the accuracy to put the cameras precisely on target. Despite these drawbacks the Air Force did obtain useful intelligence from the drone's cameras even when they were not on target, as well as some minor psychological warfare effect from the startling bright strobe flashes, and felt that the concept was worth further development. Another low-altitude reconnaissance variant was derived from the Model 147NP, the Model 147NQ. Its main distinction: instead of using an automatic guidance system, it was radio- controlled by a crewman on its DC-130 launch aircraft. =Ryan Model 147NA and 147NC= The Model 147NA was a medium-altitude electronic warfare Lightning Bug variant developed under the USAF's Compass Bin and Combat Angel programs. The 147NA had extended-span wings, a small antenna fairing on top of the fin and ability to carry chaff dispensers and active jamming pods.Taylor and Munson, Jane's Pocket Book 13 — RPVs: Robot aircraft today. p. 199 While they were a good asset to USAF capabilities during Operation Rolling Thunder, these medium-altitude Combat Angel ECM RPVs saw little use after the November 1968 official halt to air strikes on North Vietnam. The Model 147NC, which entered service in 1969 with the 11th Tactical Drone Squadron was generally similar to the Model 147NA, with the addition of endplate auxiliary fins on its tailplane. It had been designed a few years earlier to fly at medium altitude carrying AN/ALE-2 chaff dispensers under each wing to counter enemy radar systems. The Model 147NC had originally been intended to support bombing raids over North Vietnam under Compass Bin and Combat Angel, but air strikes on North Vietnam were scaled back in March 1968 and stopped completely by November so the 147NC was not deployed in its intended role. When bombing resumed in 1972, chaff was dropped by piloted F-4 Phantom fighters instead. Model 147NCs did get into action during the \\"political offensive\\" of 1972 by dropping propaganda leaflets. The project was codenamed Litterbug, but the troops called them \\"bullshit bombers\\". A medium altitude training version of the 147NC designated the Model 147NC(M1) lacked underwing pylons and was operated for reconnaissance RPV training with the 11th Tactical Drone Squadron. Some of these were later updated to AQM-34V (Ryan Model 255) standard in the mid-1970s. =Ryan Model 147H= Restored AQM-34N (Ryan Model 147H) high-altitude reconnaissance RPV (USAF S/N 67-21596) originally manufactured by Ryan Aeronautical in late 1967, on display at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. PLA-recovered examples of the Model 147H downed in China and North Vietnam were reverse engineered to build China's Wu Zhen 5 (WZ-5) drone which first flew in 1972.S/N 67-21596) restored for preservation at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum. Despite the Air Force's attention to the low-altitude mission, the service hadn't given up on using Lightning Bugs for high-altitude reconnaissance and in fact continued to improve the high-altitude variants. The result was the Model 147H third- generation high-altitude Lightning Bug which made its first operational flight in March 1967 after two years of development. It was better optimized for its mission than earlier Model 147s, many of which had been modified and put into service as quickly as possible. The Model 147H had the more powerful J69-T-41A engine of the Model 147G, a lighter airframe, and a wing further stretched to span with internal fuel tanks to increase range. The 147H was capable of reaching altitudes and had a new camera payload that provided both greater area coverage and finer resolution. \\"Stealthy\\" features that had been built into the original Lightning Bugs were becoming less and less effective, so the Model 147H was designed with new features to improve survivability, including a radar warning receiver (RWR) to alert the drone if it was illuminated by fighter or SAM radars, an improved guidance system that sent it into a right turn when alerted by the RWR, an ECM box named \\"Rivet Bouncer\\" to jam the SA-2 Fan Song radar, a coating in the jet intake to reduce radar reflectivity, and an improved no-contrail system. Older Model 147Gs continued to fly high- altitude missions in parallel with the Model 147H drones until the 147Gs were phased out in August 1967. Despite losses, the survivability of Model 147H drones did prove to be better than that of the 147B and 147G. =Ryan Model 147S Buffalo Hunter= The U.S. Air Force also pursued a refined solution for the low-altitude reconnaissance mission, and \\"refinement\\" meant balancing optimization for the mission against cost. Strategic Air Command's Buffalo Hunter program was implemented to conduct low altitude photographic reconnaissance in Southeast Asia using unmanned aircraft, particularly for time-sensitive targets such as military airfields and suspected SAM sites in North Vietnam. The initial low-altitude drone, the Model 147J, had been derived from the high-altitude Model 147B and retained the 147B's wide wings; these were a drawback because at low altitudes they reduced the drone's maneuverability. The new low-altitude optimized Model 147S had a J69-T-41A engine and featured the original Firebee wings with a span which were also lower cost to manufacture. The fuselage was stretched to a length of . The Model 147S carried a single camera that cost less but provided better coverage than the earlier dual-camera payloads. At typical operating altitudes the camera system of the 147S could image a strip of land 60 miles (96 kilometres) long with a resolution of up to 1 foot (30 centimetres), or even six inches (15 centimetres) under optimum conditions. Cost of a production Model 147S was about $160,000 USD in contemporary dollars, which was about 60% of the cost of a Model 147G or 147H. DC-130 Hercules taking off with two AQM-34L (Ryan Model 147SC) drones underwing for a reconnaissance mission over Southeast Asia. The Model 147S drones were built in a number of different production \\"blocks\\". The initial 147S block was designated the Model 147SA, and the subtype performed its initial operational flight in December 1967. The Air Force was impressed by the results of the Model 147SA missions and ordered a second batch of Model 147SBs. The Model 147SB carried a \\"multiple altitude control system\\" (MACS) that allowed it to shift in flight between three preprogrammed altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 20,000 feet (300 meters to 6,100 meters), making it much more unpredictable. It also had improved gyros to permit tighter turns. Initial flights began in March 1968, with the Model 147SAs then being phased out by attrition. The next block of 147S family was the Model 147SRE, intended for the night reconnaissance role. Instead of the white-light strobe used on the Model 147NRE, the 147SRE used an infrared strobe which was barely noticeable from the ground, and infrared film. The 147SRE also featured an improved guidance system with Doppler navigation radar and flew its first mission in November 1968. Although the Model 147SRE performed well, photo interpreters found the infrared images difficult to inspect and sometimes failed to spot targets. The low-level 147S flights were \\"exciting\\" by the standards of robot warfare. One suffered a malfunction in its flight-control computer and decided to fly at an altitude of instead of as planned. The drone made it back safely, though photo interpreters were startled to find out that the images included a picture of a power line tower, taken from underneath the power lines. The picture was posted on the unit bulletin board with a caption provided by the commander: \\"The FAA frowns on this bullshit!\\" 556th Reconnaissance Squadron flew 68 missions over North Vietnam before it was lost to anti-aircraft fire over Hanoi. Losses were heavy at the 1,000 to 1,500 feet (300 to 450 meters) altitude set for early Model 147S missions, so the flight altitude was changed to . The drones were used in missions over Hanoi and Haiphong which had powerful air defenses. One Model 147S took a picture of an SA-2 streaking past, followed by a picture of the missile exploding; then — due to an autopilot programming error — the drone skirted a ridgeline, just missing the treetops. The fourth production variant of the Model 147S family was the Model 147SC, which featured an improved Doppler radar navigation system with digital controls for greater flight accuracy. Initial operational flight of the Model 147SC Buffalo Hunter (its program codename as known to USAF crews) was in January 1969. Of the hundreds of Model 147S drones procured by the Air Force most were Model 147SCs, which would eventually fly almost half the total number of Lightning Bug missions. A modified version, the Model 147SC/TV, was introduced in the spring of 1972. This featured a TV camera that relayed imagery to the DC-130 drone controller aircraft. The low altitude- optimized 147S series continued to be developed even as the war drew to a close. The Model 147SD (AQM-34M) which saw service in 1972 and later featured external underwing tanks for extended range, a substantially more accurate navigation system, and a new cooling system to deal with tropical environmental conditions. The SD was externally similar to its SC predecessor with a slightly different nose shape and systems package; 87 of the Model 147SD were built under the Air Force's Compass Bin and Buffalo Hunter programs.Taylor and Munson, Jane's Pocket Book 13 — RPVs: Robot aircraft today. p. 203 Some 147SDs were converted to the Model 147SDL which featured a navigation system that obtained position information from the LORAN radio location network, providing the drone with greater accuracy. One Model 147SD served as a testbed for the USAF's Compass Robin program, which aimed to develop expendable radio frequency sensors that could be covertly ejected from RPVs or drones in areas defended by Soviet SA-2 Fan Song radars and thus provide the capability to collect electronic intelligence information. Ryan Model 147SK The U.S. Navy also decided to get into the reconnaissance drone business for a while. They ordered a batch of Model 147SCs modified for ship launch using a RATO booster. Navy Lightning Bugs were designated Model 147SK and were generally similar to the 147SC, except for the RATO bottle brace on lower rear fuselage/empennage and having a wingspan. First operational flight was in November 1969. After RATO launch, a Model 147SK was guided to an initial checkpoint under radio control from a Grumman E-2A Hawkeye aircraft. From that checkpoint the drone conducted the rest of the flight with its autonomous navigation system and then was recovered by helicopter. Several dozen operational flights were performed which the USN (for some obscure reason) referred to as \\"Belfrey Express\\"; these concluded in May 1970. The Air Force's 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing Strategic Reconnaissance 1956-1976: A History of the 4080th/100th SRW unit history book, on page 207, states that (based on statistical mission reliability data provided by Teledyne Ryan) the Wing provided \\"assistance to the Navy on thirty-one 147SK flights.\\" The Navy did not pursue the Lightning Bug further. Damaged airframes displayed by China and North Vietnam are reported to include some Model 147SK wreckage.Taylor and Munson, Jane's Pocket Book 13 — RPVs: Robot aircraft today. p. 201 =Ryan Model 147T and 147TE/TF Combat Dawn= By 1968 most of the Lightning Bug missions were low-altitude flights; yet the Air Force still regarded the high-altitude mission as important enough to obtain a refined version of the Model 147H, the Model 147T. Its main improvement was a more powerful engine, the Teledyne CAE J100-CA-100 with 2,800 pounds of thrust (1,270 kgp) which allowed the drone to operate at higher altitudes up to almost . The initial 147T mission was flown in April 1969 but overall frequency of high-altitude reconnaissance missions continued to decline, with the last Model 147T missions over Southeast Asia performed during June 1971. AQM-34Q (Ryan Model 147TE) Combat Dawn RPV displayed in the Southeast Asia War Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Despite the general decline in high-altitude reconnaissance RPV use, new mission roles would emerge. In April 1969 a Lockheed EC-121 Super Constellation SIGINT aircraft was shot down in international airspace by North Korean fighters, killing all 31 crew members on the aircraft. This incident led to consideration of using an unmanned drone to do the SIGINT job, resulting in the Model 147TE or Combat Dawn RPV. The Model 147TE's first operational flight was in February 1970, although this flight and those that followed over two months were really just evaluation tests. The tests proved successful and an order for fifteen production Model 147TE drones followed, with the first operational flight of a production 147TE in October 1970. Sikorsky CH-3E inflight capture of a 556th Reconnaissance Squadron AQM-34R (Ryan Model 147TF) Combat Dawn RPV. The Model 147TEs did not overfly hostile airspace; they stayed well out to sea at relatively high altitude, or cruised along the border between North and South Korea. They could fly under their own guidance or be controlled by their DC-130 launch aircraft. The drones relayed SIGINT data over a data link to ground stations for analysis. This data link technology would be developed for use in other reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Beechcraft RC-12 Guardrail. Late in the Model 147TE program, underwing external tanks were added to improve time on-station from five to eight hours. In 1973 an updated version, the Model 147TF, with external tanks as standard and improved SIGINT gear went into operation. Almost 500 missions were flown by Model 147TE and 147TF Combat Dawn RPVs between 1970 and 1975. =The last days of the Lightning Bugs 1969-1975= In 1969, the U.S. Air Force officially redesignated the Ryan 147 program model numbers as AQM-34 (see chart below), although the manufacturer-assigned numbers remained in popular use. Back in Southeast Asia, Lightning Bugs continued their overflights. A number of missions focused on a prisoner of war (POW) camp near the city of Sơn Tây in North Vietnam, in order to determine if American POWs were being held there. The drone overflights of the Son Tay camp were halted in favor of overflights with the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, as U.S. intelligence officials felt that too many drone overflights might make the enemy suspicious; this was apparently so, because when the camp was finally raided on November 21, 1970 during Operation Ivory Coast no American POWs were there. It was a disappointing result to one of the more daring operations of the war. By 1970 the Model 147 program was beginning to become public knowledge. Aviation Week magazine carried an article on the drones that November, though it was based on informal and unconfirmed information. The following spring, the Air Force released pictures of the drones along with a very general statement that they were used for reconnaissance. No technical or operational details were released. The number of drone sorties continued to increase through 1971 and 1972. The Model 147SC was the workhorse for low-altitude reconnaissance during this period; in December 1972 during Operation Linebacker II the USAF depended almost entirely on the Buffalo Hunter AQM-34L/M RPVs for bomb damage assessment due to bad weather. High altitude flights by the 147T series continued. The Model 147H was on the way out by this time, performing its last mission in September 1972. The Soviets had updated the SA-2's electronics, thus American electronic countermeasures needed to be updated as well. Cameras were replaced by a \\"SAM sniffer\\" payload, and a Model 147H flight on September 28 was able to obtain the necessary data before the drone was destroyed by an SA-2. The North Vietnamese conducted an invasion of South Vietnam in the spring of 1972 which was broken by American air power. U.S. President Richard Nixon then retaliated with a renewed bombing campaign against North Vietnam, codenamed Operation Linebacker, to persuade the North Vietnamese to negotiate. The two sides seemed to be close to an agreement, but in December 1972 the talks collapsed and President Nixon ordered the Operation Linebacker II campaign which continued into the final days of 1972. The bombing stopped completely after the January 1973 peace agreement. Reconnaissance flights continued after signing of the peace treaty in order to ensure that the North Vietnamese were honoring their side of the bargain. By this time drone technology and operational practice had been well refined. While the Model 147SC drones had been designed to survive an average of 2.5 missions, in practice the average was much higher. One example, nicknamed \\"Tom Cat\\", performed a record 68 missions. The Lightning Bug program had proven highly successful. A series of fast-track adaptations of an existing target drone resulted in a system whose effectiveness was beyond expectations, even with guidance technology that was extremely crude by 21st century standards. Despite this, Lightning Bugs could not affect the course of the war. Drone reconnaissance clearly showed that the North Vietnamese were violating their agreement with the Americans on a massive scale, but the U.S. leadership was unwilling to commit to ending its \\"endless war\\". When the North Vietnamese began their last offensive in early 1975 the U.S. did little to stop it; Saigon fell on April 30, 1975 and the war was over. The Lightning Bug program also came to an end. The last Model 147S low-altitude drone flight occurred on the day Saigon fell. AQM-34R / Model 147TF Combat Dawn flights continued until June 1975, and then most of the surviving drones were stockpiled. Post-Vietnam use and Ryan Models 234, 259 and 255 =BGM-34A, BGM-34B and BGM-34C= BGM-34A (Ryan Model 234) RPV with AGM-65 Maverick missile and bulbous data link fairing atop its vertical fin, mounted on the underwing pylon of a DC-130E.Schematic of the BGM-34C (Ryan Model 259) multi-mission RPV. Teledyne Ryan proposed follow-on drone variants based on the Model 147 series which could undertake various tactical strike and defense suppression missions, and also carry and deliver precision-guided munitions. The BGM-34 series development RPVs underwent evaluation by Tactical Air Command in the early and mid-1970s as part of the USAF's Pave Strike air- to-surface precision guided weapons program but due to post-Vietnam cutbacks (and withdrawal of NRO funding for RPVs) were never service-adopted or funded for production. Two BGM-34A prototypes were built and tested with AGM-45 Shrike, AGM-65 Maverick and Rockwell HOBOS guided weapons. Eight BGM-34Bs with more powerful Teledyne CAE J69-T-41A thrust engines were also built and evaluated, including a 'Pathfinder' version with laser designator and low light level TV (LLLTV) camera in its Philco-Ford nose pack. Six Model 147SC / AQM-34L drones were fitted with upgraded Lear Siegler avionics in 1972, redesignated YAQM-34U and five of these would later become BGM-34C multi- mission RPVs using modular nose and fuselage equipment and systems packages. Teledyne Ryan assigned their company designation Model 234 to the BGM-34A, Model 234A to the BGM-34B, and Model 259 to the BGM-34C.Taylor and Munson, Jane's Pocket Book 13 — RPVs: Robot aircraft today. pp. 211–213. AQM-34V (Ryan Model 255) electronic warfare RPV displayed at the Museum of Aviation in Warner Robins, Georgia. =XQM-103 high maneuverability RPV= In the early 1970s the United States Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory (FDL) reinforced the airframe of one Model 147J and added a digital flight control system that could be preprogrammed for combat specific maneuvers to investigate high maneuverability flight. The modified drone was originally designated the FDL-23 and later the XQM-103. Several test flights were made, with the machine able to perform 10-G turns in its final configuration. =AQM-34V / Ryan Model 255= From 1975 to 1978 approximately forty-seven Model 147NC AQM-34H/AQM-34J drones were converted to an improved countermeasures specification with both chaff dispensers and active jamming gear, and redesignated Model 255 / AQM-34V for service with the 432nd Tactical Drone Group at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. Flight tests commenced in May 1976, and sixteen new production Model 255s were additionally acquired. In 1979 the AQM-34Vs joined the other Lightning Bugs in storage. IDF designation Mabat) at Muzeyon Heyl ha-Avir, Hatzerim Airbase, Israel in 2006. =Ryan Model 124I= A number of reconnaissance RPVs were delivered to Israel in the early 1970s, designated Model 124I and fitted to Israeli specifications for low-altitude observation. The Israelis called them Mabat, meaning \\"observation\\". Although Teledyne Ryan's company designation number \\"124\\" in common with its Model 124 / BQM-34 Firebee target was nominally assigned for these export drones, their external appearance, configuration and low-altitude reconnaissance role was virtually identical to Ryan's Model 147SC and 147SD which were in extensive use by the USAF as the AQM-34L/M at that same time. The drones were ground-launched with a RATO booster and recovered in mid-air by helicopter, saw service in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and later conflicts, and were not retired until the mid-1990s. =Withdrawal from service= Operational costs, budget cuts and absence of Vietnam-era NRO 'black' funding for RPVs were not the only reasons the USAF eventually abandoned the BGM-34C and AQM-34V tactical drone projects after the 1970s. While the Model 147 series had performed well in the tropical weather conditions and relative air superiority held by the U.S. in variable-intensity conflict in Southeast Asia, its proposed reconnaissance, tactical strike and ECM successors would additionally be required by Tactical Air Command to perform in severe weather, electronic warfare and integrated air defense environments against Warsaw Pact forces in Northern Europe. BGM-34 RPV testing had shown that the drones would need deicing systems to operate effectively, their data links should be more robust, and combat launch and recovery aircraft (apart from being logistically costly) would also be at severe risk in proximity of Soviet forces, particularly the recovery helicopters. A final 'nail in the coffin' for the 1970s TAC drones was, despite the fact that they would not be delivering nuclear weapons, their \\"unmanned\\" status and flight performance fell under language spelled out in the 1979 SALT II treaty (a sensitive part of which was negotiated limits on recent U.S. cruise missiles) about self-propelled, guided, weapon delivery vehicles capable of flying distances of more than 372 miles (600 km) before fuel exhaustion; this caused the BGM-34C to be defined as a strategic weapon under the treaty. =Post-1980s use= Firebees remain in service as targets, so it is unsurprising that they are still being configured for reconnaissance missions. In the late 1990s Teledyne Ryan, using company funds, configured two Firebees with cameras and communications electronics to provide real-time intelligence for battlefield target acquisition and damage assessment. These two UAVs, each named Argus, were used in a USAF \\"Green Flag\\" exercise to relay images in real-time from the test range in Nevada to Air Force officers in Florida. Five BQM-34-53 Extended Range Firebees were also used to lay chaff corridors during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The drones were modernized by Northrop Grumman in a fast-response program earlier that year, being fitted with chaff dispensers and other improvements including GPS-based programmable waypoint guidance systems (which may or not have been added by the upgrade program). These Firebees were delivered for service in charcoal-black paint schemes. Only one DC-130 drone launcher aircraft remained in the U.S. military's inventory at the time and was not immediately operational due to a malfunction. Two Firebees were ground-launched on the first night of the operation; the other three were air-launched by the DC-130 on the second night of the operation. The drones flew until they ran out of fuel and crashed. Iraqi TV broadcast footage of the wrecks while describing them as piloted aircraft. =WZ-5 UAV= China is known to have recovered U.S. AQM-34Ns during the Vietnam War era and reverse engineered them. The Chinese version is known domestically as Wu Zhen 5 (WZ-5), or Chang Hong 1 for export. The WZ-5 entered service in 1981 and is expected to be replaced by newer UAVs in the near future. WZ-5 prototypes were launched from a modified PLAAF Tupolev Tu-4 bomber; modified Y-8 transports later took over air launching of WZ-5s in an approach similar to USAF's. The WZ-5 has a WP-11 turbojet engine which provides performance close to the J85-GE-100. One WZ-5 displayed in the China Aviation Museum, Beijing was painted with a few small-sized Vietnamese national flags; it was widely speculated this example had been sent to Vietnam to carry out missions during the 1979 conflict.\\"Chinese PLAAF WZ5 UAV.\\" AirForceWorld.com.

Mission summary A total of 3,435 Lightning Bug sorties were flown against Communist China, North Vietnam, and North Korea, with the mission breakdown by year as follows: *1964: 20 *1965: 77 *1966: 105 *1967: >100 *1968: 340 *1969: 437 *1970: >400 *1971: 406 *1972: 570 *1973: 444 *1974: 518 (includes flights in first half of 1975) Almost half of the missions were flown by the Model 147SC, of which about a thousand were built. 578 drones of all types were lost, with over half shot down and the rest lost in various accidents. It is something of a compliment to the usefulness of the Model 147 that the Chinese used the Lightning Bugs shot down over their territory to copy the basic Firebee design and produce it themselves.

He was a scion of the Rathore clan. His father was Rao Ganga Ji and his mother was Rani Padmavati of Sirohi. Rao Maldev fought in the Battle of Khanwa as a young prince, the defeat at Khanwa greatly weakened all the Rajput kingdoms in India, but Marwar under Maldev's capable rule turned into a powerful Rajput Kingdom that resisted foreign rule and challenged them for northern supremacy. Maldev refused to ally with either the Sur Empire or the Mughal Empire after Humayun regained control of north India in 1555. This policy was continued by his son and successor Chandrasen Rathore.

Agha Ahmad Ali, Asiatic society of Bengal, 3 vols reprint, 1977, vol II, pp. 160, 197 Family Maldev was born on 5 December 1511 as the eldest son of Rao Ganga, the Rathore ruler of Marwar. His mother, rani Padma Kumari, was a princess from the Deora Chauhan kingdom of Sirohi. By the time he ascended the throne in 1532, Maldev already enjoyed the reputation of being an intrepid warrior. Traditional and popular accounts list him amongst the most important rulers that Marwar has known. Early years Maldev had supported his father in several campaigns. At an early age he defeated the rebels of Sojat and humbled Rao Veeram Dev of Merta by defeating him in battle. In 1517 he led the Marwar army against Sultan Muzaffar Shah of Gujarat and helped Rana Sanga to install Rao Raimal as the Ruler of Idar. Maldev later led a 4,000 strong army and helped the Rana in the siege of Bayana on February 1527 and a month later at Khanwa. He personally led the charge on the left wing of the Mughal army and after the Rajput confederacy's defeat, he carried the wounded and unconsious Rana out of the battlefield. In 1529 the Rathore rebel Shekha and Khanzada Daulat Khan of Nagaur attacked Jodhpur, however Rao Ganga and Maldev defeated this army and killed Shekha. Expansion The rulers of Marwar once held sway over nine Rathore chieftains, however by the time Maldev acceded to the throne, he ruled only two districts.Rajasthan District Gazetteer vol. 22, p. 22 Maldev thus attacked these nine chieftains and changed Marwars stance of overlordship to absolute control. Maldev also defeated the Sindhals of Raipur and Bhadrajun and fortified the two cities. In 1534 Maldev attacked Nagaur and forced Daulat Khan to flee to Ajmer. Maldev soon attacked Merta, Rian and Ajmer and captured them. The petty lords of Didwana and Pachpadra also acknowledged Maldevs suzerainty. His attack on Jaisalmer was also successful and it brought the Bhatti rulers under his sway. In 1538 Maldev attacked Jalore and captured Sultan Sikandar Khan. The Sultan was imprisoned and died after a short period in captivity. Maldev after capturing Jalore attacked and annexed Sanchore, Bhinmal, Radhanpur and Nabhara (In Gujarat). Maldevs western territory at this time extended upto Sindh-Cholistan in the west and parts of Gujarat in the south-west. He had direct control over 40 districts in and around present day Rajasthan. In 1539 Maldev took advantage of the war between the Mughals and the Sur Empire to conquer Bayana, Tonk and Toda.History of Rajasthan by Rima Hooja Section:The State of Marwar/Jodhpur, pg 520-522 By regaining territories from Afghan occupation, Maldev Rathore restored Hindu rule in the area and abolished the Jizya tax there. His northern boundary at Jhajjar was only about fifty kilometers from Delhi.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Mughul Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 81–2 According to Satish Chandra, \\"Maldev's kingdom almost the whole of western and eastern Rajasthan including Sambhal and Narnaul (In Haryana). His armies could be seen as far as the outskirts of Agra. Chandra also says that, Maldev had the mirage of reviving the 8th century Rashtrakuta empire. But unlike Rana Sanga he did not have the support of the Rajput tribes and politically no empire based in Rajasthan alone could challenge or defeat an empire that stretched from Punjab to the Upper Ganga valley.\\" This was pointing towards Maldev's hope of competing with the Mughal and Sur empires.Medieval India (1526–1748) Part two. by Satish Chandra. p. 79 War with Mewar Maldev took advantage of the Mewari civil war and invaded Mewar. He established a garrison at Jaunpur (in Mewar) and annexed the lands of Sambhar, Kalsi, Fatehpur, Rewasa, Chota-Udaipur, Chatsu, Lawan and Malwarana. It was during this time that the Sisodia nobles asked Maldev to aid them against Banbir. The combined Rathor-Sisodia army defeated Banbir and secured the throne for Udai Singh II. Maldev continued to take advantage of the war and used the situation to form military posts in Mewar, Bundi and Ranthambore. This led to a bitter rivalry between Udai Singh II and Maldev Rathore.The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore, India)., Volume 62. p. 24The History and Culture of the Indian People, Volume 7. p. 332 Maldev and Humayun Maldev Rathore had made an alliance with the Mughal emperor Humayun against Sher Shah Suri. But shortly after Humayun was defeated in the battles of Chausa and Kannauj by the Afghan emperor. Humayun upon losing most of his territories turned to Maldev for help and was called to Marwar for refuge by the Rao. According to Rajput sources, Mughals killed several cows on the way to Marwar, this made the local Rajputs hostile towards Humayun as cows were sacred to the Hindus. Humayun was thus forced to flee from Marwar. The Mughal sources however blame Maldev for betrayal and say that Maldev breached the alliance because he was given more favourable terms by Sher Shah.Babur and Humayun: Modern Learning Organisation By Aditya Gupta p. 58 according to Satish Chandra - \\"Maldeo invited him, but seeing the small size of his following, set his face against him\\" Chandra also says that Maldeo could have arrested Humayun but he refrained as he was an invited guest.Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II By Satish Chandra pg.68, 80 War with Jaisalmer Maldeo Rathore was expanding his territories westward and besieged Jaisalmer in 1537. Rawal Lunkaran was forced to sue for peace by giving Maldeo his daughter Umade Bhattiyani in marriage to him..Through this alliance Maldev was able to secure his western borders and employ a large number of Bhati rajputs from Jaisalmer.Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II By Satish Chandra War with Bikaner Bikaner was a Rathore kingdom situated towards the north of Marwar. Relations between Marwar and Bikaner had been bitter since the time of Bikaners foundation by Rao Bika. Rao Maldev used a minor border dispute as a pretext for war and fought a battle with Rao Jaitsi in 1542 at the battle of Sohaba, Rao Jaitsi was killed in battle and Rao Maldev took advantage of this situation to annex the entire kingdom of Bikaner.Rajasthan p. 70 by Dharmpal War with the Sur Empire A Marital alliance with Jaisalmer secured Marwars western borders but Maldev was fiercely opposed by the dispossessed chiefs of Bikaner and Merta who made an alliance with the Afghan chief of Delhi against Marwar.Rajasthan Directory & Who's Who p. 15 According to The Cambridge History of India – \\"Shershah invaded Marwar with an army of 80,000 horsemen but he still hesitated to attack the Rathore army of 50,000 horsemen\\". He thus forged letters and deceived Maldev into abandoning his commanders to their fate. Jaita and Kumpa, the two commanders of Maldev refused to retreat and gave battle to Afghans near. With a small force of 10,000 they vigorously attacked Sher Shah's centre and created confusion in his army. Soon overwhelming numbers and Afghan gunfire halted the Rajput charge. According to Satish Chandra - Sher Shahs oft quoted remark \\" I had given away the country of Delhi for a handful of millets\\" is a tribute to the gallantry of Jaita and Kumpa and the willingness of the Rajputs to face death even in the face of impossible odds. After this Battle of Sammel, Khawas Khan Marwat and Isa Khan Niyazi took possession of Jodhpur and occupied the territory of Marwar from Ajmer to Mount Abu in 1544. However Maldev reoccupied his lost territories in 1545.Mahajan, V.D. (1991, reprint 2007). History of Medieval India, Part II, New Delhi: S. Chand, , p.43The Cambridge History of India pp. 54–55 War with Amer Rao Maldev defeated Bharmal and captured four districts of the Amer kingdom. Bharmal in order to save himself sought help from Haji Khan Sur. Battle of Harmoda Haji Khan was a slave of Sher Shah Suri and became the lord of Ajmer and Nagaur after the Battle of Sammel. Maldev who was on a resurgence to win back his lost territories attacked Haji, however the States of Mewar and Bikaner came to Haji's aid and forced Maldev to retreat. The relations between Haji and Udai Singh II deteriorated quickly, according to one account it was due to the demand of a dancegirl by Udai Singh in return for his help against Maldev. Udai Singh threatened Haji for war upon which he fled to the refuge of Maldev and together their armies defeated Udai Singh on January 1557 in the Battle of Harmoda. Maldev captured the fortified city of Merta after the battle. Maldev further invaded Amber and forced the Kachwaha Raja to become a feudatory of Marwar.Arms & Armour at the Jaipur court by Robert Elgood p.10 — \\"the small kingdom of Amber was a feudatory of Marwar until the sixteenth century\\". Mughal Invasions Akbar succeeded Humayun in 1556, he soon became the most powerful Ruler in India and formulated an imperial policy. Many Rajput chiefs mustered around him with their grievances against the Rathor Chief of Jodhpur. Akbar used this as a casus belli against Maldev and sent several expeditions against Marwar. Qasim Khan, Sayyid Hussain Baraha and Shah Quli Khan conquered Jaitaran in 1559. Sharfuddin Hussain Mirza conquered Merta in 1562.G.R.

The district is one of the oldest district of Chhattisgarh. The headquarters of the district is Ambikapur. Surguja is a tribal dominated district in the north- eastern part of Chhattisgarh state of India. The district lies in its eponymous Surguja dialectal region (where Surgujia is spoken) and is to the east of the Vindhyachal-Baghelkhand region of peninsular India. The district spread over a vast mountainous area inhabited by many different people groups such as the Gond, Bhumij, Oraon, Panika, Korwa, Bhuiya, Kharwar, Munda, Chero, Rajwar, Nagesia and Santal. History According to legend, Lord Rama had visited Surguja during his 14 years of exile into the forests. There are many places in connection to epic of Ramayana, which are named after Lord Rama, Laxmana and Goddess Sita such as Ramgarh, Sita-Bhengra and Laxmangarh. Prior to the arrival of the Mauryas, the area was ruled by the Nandas. In the third century BC the region was divided into tiny kingdoms. Later, a Rajput king belonging to the Rakshal clan attacked from what is now Jharkhand, and took control of the area. In 1820, Amar Singh was crowned as Maharaja. During the British Raj period, Surguja State was a princely state. The district is currently a part of the Red corridor. Geography It lies between 23°37'25\\" to 24°6'17\\" north latitude and 81°34'40\\" to 84°4'40\\" east longitude. long east to west and broad north to south, this land has as area of about . The high- lands of Surguja district have peculiar 'pat formations' – highlands with small tablelands. The Mainpat, the Jarang pat, the Jonka pat, the Jamira pat and the Lahsunpat are the major parts of the district. The average height of area is above . Some of the peaks are Mailan , Jam , Parta Gharsa , Kanda Dara , Chutai , and Karo . There are a number of other peaks. North–west Surguja is hilly in nature, and moving westwards, three distinct steps may be marked out: the first from Shrinagar on the east to the low-lands of Patna and Kharsawan, the second from thence to the uplands around Sonhat and the third beyond Sonhat to above a height of . Central Surguja is a low basin through which the Rihand and its tributaries flow. The soil of the Surguja District can be broadly classified into four major types: red and yellow soils, alluvial soils, laterite soils, and medium blue soils. Red and yellow soils are derived from the parent rocks of the Gondwana System including sedimentary rocks. They are formed in-situ from the erosion of such rocks caused by rain. This soil is found particularly in east Sitapur, south Ambikapur, central Surajpur and Pratappur blocks. The red color is due to wide diffusion of iron while hydration of ferric oxide results in a yellow color in the soil. This soil is of lighter texture and has a porous and friable structure. Soluble salt is found in small quantities. Lime, kankar and free kankar are totally absent. These soils are poor in potash, nitrogen, humus and carbonate and differ greatly in consistency, color, depth and fertility. On the uplands they are thin and gravelly, sandy, porous and light coloured alluvium, generally transported from elsewhere, are found along river banks in alternate layers of sand and silt in East Ramanujganj, North Ambikapur, and Surajpur, along the river banks of the Rihand, Kanhar, and the Hasdeo rivers and their major tributaries. The colour of the soil is not uniform but varies from yellow to grey. Laterite soils are well developed on the summits of the plateau regions of Samri and Sitapur tehsil including Shankargargh, Kusmi, Sitapur, Batoli and Mainpat blocks of Mainpat, Jamirapat, Lahsunpat and Jonkpat. There are three river basins in Suguja district – those of the Hasdeo River, the Rihand River and the Kanhar River. In winters temperature dips to below and in summers it rises above .  Agriculture  About 90% of the working population depends on agriculture, in which 50.36% of working population are of cultivated and about 12.77% of the region are agriculture labourers. Agriculture is directly connected with land and water resources. In Surguja the percentage concentration of cultivated land is maximum in central zone of the district stretching east to west direction. North and south of this one the percentage of concentration decreases, because of several factors, out of them here are two major factors. The uplands and high lands are mostly covered with rocky wastelands, infertile soil, woods and scrubs, sloppy and forested area. Unavailability of water for irrigation over most of area, improper drainage difficulty in digging wells due to rocky basement, undeveloped means of communication, transportation have restricted the extension of cultivated land. On the other hand, the central surguja is relatively level and has fertile soils, some water is available for irrigation in various ways, and a means of communication is developed. Double cropped area is generally associated with water supply, natural or artificial and the pressure of population. Wherever the physical condition permits and the pressure more over the land, two crops are raised in a year from the same field. As result, a particular pattern of use of land resources emerges, which helps in the delineation of planning regions on the basis of present available resources and the limit of their utilisation. Of course there is no uniformity in the distribution of double cropped area, but the study of its distribution will be of use in the need as well as the resources. Thus most of the concentration is to be found in two patches: * Ramanujnagar block * Ambikapur & Central North- East of Lundra, Rajpur, Shankargarh, Wadragnagar and Pratappur blocks Almost the whole of the central plain has medium to relatively high value, with few exception due to local condition. In this part during summer most of the area remains uncultivated. Only in Ambiakpur block here is some concentration of double cropped area due to irrigation facilities. The per capita land is declining due to the increasing in rural population which can be fed by increasing the per acre output through bringing more and more cultivated land under double cropped system, by extending irrigation facilities, using better fertilizers and better culture. The assessment of physical condition for different crops helps in arranging them so as to derive the optimum return of it, which may be done through the study of their distribution along with the average production. The production of land provided to different crops depends upon physically suitability of soil and availability of water etc. Not only this the local needs is also important in this connection. Roughly 41.67% out of the total geographical area is under cultivation. Demographics According to the 2011 census Surguja district has a population of 2,359,886, roughly equal to the nation of Latvia or the US state of New Mexico. This gives it a ranking of 192nd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 19.74%. Surgujahas a sex ratio of 976 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 61.16%. 55% of the district is from Scheduled Tribes. Among the primitive tribes are Pando and Korwa, who still live in the forest. The Pando tribe believes themselves to be members of the \\"Pandav\\" clan of epic Mahabharata. The Korwa tribe believes themselves to be members of the \\"Kauravs\\" of Mahabharata. =Languages= At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 60.51% of the population in the district spoke Surgujia, 10.09% Hindi, 9.12% Sadri, 7.60% Kurukh, 4% Bhojpuri and 1.07% Bengali as their first language.2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue Education Surguja University, Ambikapur was established on 2 September 2008.

Minerals  Mineral belts of Surguja: *Upper catchments of river or Sitapur-Samri belt: This belt is associated with eastern and south eastern part of the district. It abounds in bauxite and some amount of coal. * Central-north Surguja (Wadrafnagar- Pa-–Pratappur-Surajpur-Ambikapur) belt: The reserve of coal, pyritic minerals, sulphur, mica berylluiim, byerites, copper, and galena are reported. Bishrampur, Bhatgaon, Tatapani, Ramkola, Lakhanpur and Basen are the main coal fields. Some fire-clay, mica, coal, galena, and silmenite are also reported in Wadrafnagar near U.P. border. In Surguja bauxite deposits have been found in tertiary rocks. Due to decay and weathering of aluminium rich rocks, felspar usually kaolinised under tropical monsoon conditions, the weathering goes a step further and results in a residue rich in hydroxides of aluminium together with oxides of iron, manganese and titanium with sufficient contraction of aluminium hydroxides, economic deposits of bauxite originates. This process of 'bauxitisation' as it is called thrives well on a topographically elevated well drained plateaus of low relief. The recoverable reserves of bauxite in Surguja is 57.54 million tonnes, which is around 57% of total state reserve. Out of 57.74 million tonnes, 42.21 million tonnes are under proved category, 13.56 million tonnes under probable category and remaining 1.76 million tonnes under are possible category. About 51 million tonnes of the total reserves are of metallurgical grade and the grade particular of 6 million tonnes are not known. The economical deposits are located at entire pat (local name given to plateau or pleatux) region of eastern and south eastern Surguja including Mainpat, Samari and Jamirapat. * Mainpat: bauxite is of good and thickness varies from 4–5 meters. * Jamirapat and Samripat Bauxite deposits of these areas are metallurgical grade I. These two major reserves are centred in Samri tehsil and adjacent plateaus – Jamripat, Jaranpat, Lahsunpat, Jonkapat and other small hill rocks. Most of the coal in the Gondwana is found in barakar series. Coal as a solid stratified rock composed mainly of hydrocarbon and capable of being used as a fuel to supply heat or light or both. The coal fields of Surguja belongs to Gondwana coal fields. The coal of this area is of good quality stream and gas coals. The coal fields of Surguja can be classified as: *Middle Gondwana Coal Fields: Tatapani-Ramkola, Jhilmili and Sonhat *Talchir Coal Fields: Bisrampur, Bansar, Lakhanpur, Panchbhaini and Damha-munda *Mahanadi Valley: Hasdo-Rampur See also *Balrampur district, Chhattisgarh *Surajpur district *Ambikapur References * Surguja ka ek Adhyaan, by Samar Bahadur Singhdeo, 1957 Varanasi. * Dr. Sanjay Alung- Chhattisgarh ki Riyaste/Princely stastes aur Jamindariyaa (Vaibhav Prakashan, Raipur1, ) * Dr. Sanjay Alung-Chhattisgarh ki Janjaatiyaa/Tribes aur Jatiyaa/Castes (Mansi publication, Delhi6, )  External links  * Official website Districts of Chhattisgarh Coal mining districts in India ","title":"Surguja district"},{"id":"3524982","text":"Tug Transom is a British daily comic strip written by Peter O'Donnell and drawn by Alfred Sindall.

His name may come from the Abkhaz language word a-psaatʷ, meaning \\"bird\\", or possibly from the name of the Christian saint with whom he was popularly associated, Saint Eustathios. Some sources regard him as responsible for all hunted game, while others consider him to watch over fish and birds specifically. In some cycles, he is the primary hunting god, while in others, he is part of a pantheon of hunting deities. A few sources connect him with thunder and lightning.  Svan people  The Svan people of Georgia regard Apsat as one among a pantheon of hunting deities, said to be assistants of the deity Ber Shishvlish, the \\"Lord of the Bare Mountain\\". To the Svan, Apsat is the patron of fish and birds. In this capacity, he works with Dzhgyrag (the Svan name for St. George), who is associated with hunters and wolves, Cxek'ish angelwez (the Angel of the Forest) who is responsible for forest animals like bears and foxes, and the goddess Dali, the patron of hoofed mountain animals like goats. The association of Apsat with fish and birds is thought to stem from the eagle, which, as a fishing bird, is associated with both the sky and the water.  Ossetian people  To the Ossetian people, Apsat is called Avsati or Æfsati, and he is regarded as the primary deity of the hunt. He appears as such in the Ossetian epic called the Nart saga. Ossetian hunters referred to game as Æfsati's cattle (). Hunters would make offerings and sing hymns begging his favor, and if successful in the hunt, would offer roasted organs such as the heart or the liver for thanks. He is most commonly portrayed as elderly, bearded, and either one-eyed or blind. It was said that he dwelt in a hut deep in the forest with his wife and daughters, and would occasionally permit huntsmen to marry his daughters. Occasionally he was portrayed as a man with antlers or an animal with a white coat.  Other traditions  The Karachay people of the North Caucasus revered Apsat as Apsatı or ApsatƏ, god of hunting and prey. His daughter Fatima was known for her beauty. Like the Ossetian Æfsati, Apsatı often took the form of a white goat.

Sir Thomas Duncombe Love Jones-Parry, 1st Baronet (5 January 1832 - 18 December 1891), was a British landowner and Liberal politician. He was one of the founders of the Y Wladfa settlement in Patagonia. Love Jones-Parry inherited the Madryn estate from his father, Sir Love Jones-Parry. He was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford, later becoming a High Sheriff in 1854. He was a prominent figure in eisteddfodic circles, where he had the bardic name \\"Elphin\\". Jones-Parry rose to prominence in politics when he won the Caernarvonshire seat in the 1868 election, defeating the Tory candidate, Douglas Pennant (later Lord Penrhyn). He lost this seat at the next election, but won the Caernarvon Boroughs seat at a by-election in 1882 and held it until 1886. He was made a baronet by Gladstone for his services to the Liberal Party. Towards the end of 1862 Captain Love Jones-Parry, accompanied by Lewis Jones, left for Patagonia to decide whether it was a suitable area for Welsh emigrants. The trip was largely financed by Jones-Parry, who paid at least £750 from his own pocket. They first visited Buenos Aires where they held discussions with the Interior Minister Guillermo Rawson then, having come to an agreement, they headed south. They reached Patagonia in a small ship named the Candelaria, and were driven by a storm into a bay which they named \\"Porth Madryn\\" after Jones-Parry's estate in Wales. The town which grew near the spot where they landed is now named Puerto Madryn . Following a favourable report from Jones-Parry and Lewis Jones, a group of 162 Welsh emigrants departed for Patagonia in the ship Mimosa in 1865. Later there was criticism that the report had given too favourable an impression of the area, though the criticism was directed at Lewis Jones rather than Love Jones-Parry.

Often this is an isosceles triangle of height 1 and base 2 in which case it is referred to as the triangular function. Triangular functions are useful in signal processing and communication systems engineering as representations of idealized signals, and the triangular function specifically as an integral transform kernel function from which more realistic signals can be derived, for example in kernel density estimation. It also has applications in pulse code modulation as a pulse shape for transmitting digital signals and as a matched filter for receiving the signals. It is also used to define the triangular window sometimes called the Bartlett window.  Definitions  The most common definition is as a piecewise function: : begin{align} operatorname{tri}(x) = Lambda(x)  &overset{underset{text{def}}{}}{=}  maxbig(1 - x, 0big)  &= begin{cases} 1 - x, & x < 1;  0 & text{otherwise}.  end{cases} end{align} Equivalently, it may be defined as the convolution of two identical unit rectangular functions: : begin{align} operatorname{tri}(x) &= operatorname{rect}(x) * operatorname{rect}(x)  &= int_{-infty}^infty operatorname{rect}(x - tau) cdot operatorname{rect}(tau) ,dtau.  end{align} The triangular function can also be represented as the product of the rectangular and absolute value functions: :operatorname{tri}(x) = operatorname{rect}(x/2) big(1 - xbig). Alternative triangle function Note that some authors instead define the triangle function to have a base of width 1 instead of width 2: : begin{align} operatorname{tri}(2x) = Lambda(2x)  & overset{underset{text{def}}{}}{=}  maxbig(1 - 2x, 0big)  &= begin{cases} 1 - 2x, & x < tfrac12;  0 & text{otherwise}.  end{cases} end{align} In its most general form a triangular function is any linear B-spline: : operatorname{tri}_j(x) = begin{cases} (x - x_{j-1})/(x_j - x_{j-1}), & x_{j-1} le x < x_j;  (x_{j+1} - x)/(x_{j+1} - x_j), & x_j le x < x_{j+1};  0 & text{otherwise}. end{cases} Whereas the definition at the top is a special case :Lambda(x) = operatorname{tri}_j(x), where x_{j-1} = -1, x_j = 0, and x_{j+1} = 1. A linear B-spline is the same as a continuous piecewise linear function f(x), and this general triangle function is useful to formally define f(x) as :f(x) = sum_j y_j cdot operatorname{tri}_j(x), where x_j < x_{j+1} for all integer j. The piecewise linear function passes through every point expressed as coordinates with ordered pair (x_j, y_j), that is, :f(x_j) = y_j.

Etymology The name is derived from a word čad (smoke, soot; Proto-Slavic: čadъ, Slovak/Czech: čad, Polish: czad ). The form Čadca is a toponymic appellative. The name was probably motivated by the burning glades. Geography It is located south of the Jablunkov Pass, surrounded by the Javorníky, Kysucké Beskydy and Turzovská vrchovina mountain ranges. It lies in the valley of the Kysuca river, around north of Žilina and is part of the historic region of Kysuce. A Goral minority lives in the surroundings. History The town was established in the 17th century; the first written reference dates back to 1565 as Tzaczcka. The town charter was granted in 1778. Demographics According to the 2010 census, the town had 24,959 inhabitants with 2.2% Czech and 0.4% Roma. The religious make-up was 82.97% Roman Catholics and 0.36% Lutherans; most of others stated no religious affiliation. History One of the world's largest (and last) producers of vacuum tubes, JJ Electronic has a factory in Čadca. Transport Čadca railway station is the town's main station. It forms part of the cross- border Žilina–Čadca–Svrčinovec zastávka–Mosty u Jablunkova railway (to the Czech Republic), and is also a junction station for two other lines, one of them also cross-border (to Poland).

He was the son of Rao Ranmal (Rao Ridmal) of the Rathore clan. He is known for founding the city of Jodhpur in 1459. Ancestry Rao Ranmal secured the throne of Mandore in 1427. In addition to ruling Mandore, Rao Ranmal also became the administrator of Mewar to assist Maharana Mokal (father of Rana Kumbha). After the assassination of Maharana Mokal by two brothers (Chacha and Mera) in 1433, Ranmal continued as administrator of Mewar at the side of Rana Kumbha. Early years After Rana Kumbha assassinated Rao Jodha's father Rao Ranmal, Rao Jodha escaped Mewar with his men. Approximately 700 horsemen accompanied Rao Jodha from Chittor. Fighting near Chittor and a valiant attempt to bar the pursuers at Someshwar Pass resulted in heavy losses amongst Jodha's warriors. When Jodha reached Mandore he had only seven people accompanying him. Jodha collected whatever forces he could, abandoned Mandore and pressed on towards Jangalu. Jodha barely managed to reach safety at Kahuni (a village near present-day Bikaner). For 15 years Jodha tried in vain to recapture Mandore. Jodha's opportunity to strike finally came in 1453 with Rana Kumbha facing simultaneous attacks by the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat. Jodha made a surprise attack on Mandore using horses seized from the Thakur of Setrawa and other jagirdars. Jodha's forces overwhelmed the defenders and captured Mandore with relative ease. Jodha then successively captured Chaukade, Sojat, Merta, Bahirunda and Kosana(Rishi Dadhichi's origin). Rana Kumbha did make attempts to recapture these territories, albeit unsuccessfully. Jodha and Kumbha eventually settled their differences in order to face their common enemies, the rulers of Malwa and Gujarat. Legend about capture of Mandore Once, late at night, Rao Jodha stopped at a farmers house. They did not recognize who he was. He was given a bowl of hot khichdi, an Indian stew. Jodha put his fingers in the centre of the bowl and burnt his fingers. The farmer's wife commented, \\"Stranger, you are making the same mistake as our king (Jodha) is. Khichdi is hottest in the centre and coolest at the edge\\". This prompted Jodha to stop worrying about Mandore and just focus on outlying forts, which he managed to win with ease. In due time he captured Mandore. Later conquests The Delhi Sultanate took advantage of Rao Jodha's war with Rana Kumbha and captured several Rathore strongholds including Nagaur, Jhalor and Siwana. Rao Jodha formed an alliance with several Rajput clans including the Deora's and Bhati's and attacked the Delhi army, he succeeded in capturing Merta, Phalodi, Pokran, Bhadrajun, Sojat, Jaitaran, Siwana, Nagaur and Godwar from the Delhi Sultanate. These areas were permanently captured from Delhi and became a part of Marwar. The most powerful Kingdom in Rajputana.Jibraeil: \\"Position of Jats in Churu Region\\", The Jats - Vol. II, Ed Dr Vir Singh, Delhi, 2006, p. 223G.S.L. Devra, op. cit., 7-8, Cf. Dayaldas ri Khyat, part 2, p. 4-5 According to Nainsi's Vigat (Marwar ra parganam ri vigat) the rulers of Jalore and Bundi submitted to Rao Jodha. Ajmer and Sambhar were ceded to Jodha by Rana Kumbha's son, Udaysimha (Udaysingh I). The ruler of Mohilavati, Ajit Singh died in a battle with Rao Jodha's forces and the city was captured some years later. After settling down in the aforementioned village of Kahuni, Jodha's son Bika founded the kingdom of Bikaner. Rao Jodha thus laid the foundation of the powerful Jodhpur State. Foundation of Jodhagarh/Jodhpur Mehrangarh fort, Jodhpur A holy man sensibly advised Rao Jodha to move the capital to hilltop safety. By 1459, it became evident that a more secure headquarters was required. Chidia-tunk, a high rocky ridge, nine km to the south of Mandore was an obvious choice for the new city of Jodhagarh. The natural elevation was enhanced by a fortress of staggering proportions, to which Rao Jodha's successors added over the centuries. Jodhagarh was on the important Delhi to Gujarat trade route and it greatly benefited from the trade of silk, opium, sandalwood, copper and other items. The Mehrangarh Fort, situated on a 125 m high hill, is among the most impressive and formidable forts in Rajasthan. The construction of the fort was begun by Maharaja Rao Jodha in 1459 and was improvised by Maharaja Jaswant Singh (1637–1680). The fort originally had seven gates (\\"pols\\"). There is a first gate with spikes to prevent attack from elephants. The Fatehpol or victory gate was erected by Maharaja Ajit Singh in 1707 to commemorate his victory over the Mughals. The other gates include the Jayapol, built by Maharaja Man Singh in 1806, following his victory over the armies of Jaipur and Bikaner. Death and the succession Rao Jodha died on 6 April 1489, aged 73. The death of Rao Jodha was followed by a struggle for succession amongst his sons. He was succeeded by his son Rao Satal (1489–1491). After his death, his brother Rao Suja (1491–1515) occupied the throne.

It is located beneath the crossroads formed by Ermine Street and the Icknield Way. It is protected as both a scheduled ancient monument and Grade I listed building. It has been speculated that it was used by the Knights Templar, who founded nearby Baldock, but this is unlikely, despite its enormous popular appeal. There are numerous theories about the Cave covering Freemasons and Templars as well as possibilities that the Cave was a prison or an anchorite cell. However, none of these theories have enough hard evidence to warrant their being adopted by the Cave Trust. It is open to the public in the summer months on Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holiday afternoons between Easter and October. Plate I from Joseph Beldam's book The Origins and Use of the Royston Cave, 1884 showing some of the numerous carvings. Royston Cave is a circular, bell-shaped chamber cut into the chalk bedrock. It is 8 metres (26 feet) high and 5 metres (17 feet) in diameter with a circumferential octagonal podium. The origin of this chamber is unknown. This cave is unique in Britain for its numerous medieval carvings on the walls; comparable examples exist only in the former Czechoslovakia and Israel. Some of the figures are thought to be those of St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. Lawrence and St. Christopher. Speculations Royston Cave has been the source of much speculation, although it is hard to determine much about its origin and function. * Knights Templar: It has been recently speculated that the cave may have been used by the Knights Templar before their dissolution by Pope Clement V in 1312.Beamon, S 1992 The Royston Cave: used by saints or sinners? Local historical influences of the Templar and Hospitaller movements. Cortney Publications, 1); Although claims have been made that this religious-military institution of the Catholic Church held a weekly market at Royston between 1199 and 1254, the market charter was in fact granted to the Augustinian Canons of the town. It has been speculated that the cave was divided into two floors by a wooden floor, the evidence consisting of a single posthole and what may be beam slots to secure the platform to the walls. Two figures close together near the damaged section may be all that remains of a known Templar symbol, two knights riding the same horse. However, as the image has been repaired in modern times, this cannot be confirmed. In 1953, the architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, wrote that the date of the carvings \\"is hard to guess. They have been called Anglo-Saxon, but are more probably of various dates between the C14 and C17 (the work of unskilled men)\\".Pevsner, N & Cherry, B 1971 The Buildings of England: Hertfordshire. Revised edition. Penguin, p 282 This would place the carvings after the time of the Templars; certainly the figures in armour are wearing full plate, which would date them to a century after the Templars' demise. * Augustinian store house: It has been claimed it was used by Augustinian monks from the local priory, who would have required a cool store for their produce and a chapel for their devotions. The idea that it might have been a meeting place for recusant Catholics during the Reformation of the 16th century has little to recommend it. Plate II from Joseph Beldam's book The Origins and Use of the Royston Cave, 1884 showing more of the carvings. *Neolithic flint mine: this has also been put forward as an explanation of the cave. Rediscovery Although the origin of the cave is unknown, its rediscovery is well documented. In August 1742 a workman dug a hole in the Butter Market to build footings for a new bench for the patrons and traders. He discovered a buried millstone and dug around it to remove it. He found a shaft leading down into the chalk. When discovered, the cavity was more than half-filled with earth. The rumour was that there must be a treasure buried beneath the soil inside the cave. Several cartloads of soil were removed until bedrock was reached. The soil was discarded as worthless as it only contained a few old bones and fragments of pottery. Today's archaeology could have analysed the soil in depth. The Reverend G North's description of a brown earthenware cup with yellow spots discovered in the soil filling the cave sounds like a well-known early post-medieval type, no earlier than the late 16th century. Today the entrance is not by the original opening, but by a passage dug in 1790. The cave is at the junction of an ancient east-west track, the Icknield Way, and the north-south Roman road, Ermine Street. Icknield Way was used during the Iron Age and traces of its side ditches have been excavated at Baldock. It has been claimed to run from the Thames Valley towards East Anglia, although this has recently been called into question.Harrison, S 2003 'The Icknield Way: some queries' in Archaeological Journal 160, 1-22, p 15 The modern-day A505 between Royston and Baldock approximately follows its route. Plate III from Joseph Beldam's book The Origins and Use of the Royston Cave, 1884 showing the shape and floor plan of the cave. It is thought that the sculptures were originally coloured, but little trace of this is visible now; in the mid 19th century, Joseph Beldam could still see the yellow dress of St Catherine and the red of the Holy Family. They are mostly religious images, such as the Crucifixion and various saints. St Lawrence is depicted holding the gridiron on which he was martyred. A crowned figure holding a wheel appears to be St Catherine, and a large figure with a staff and a child on his shoulder represents St Christopher. A figure with a drawn sword could be St Michael or possibly St George. Another possibly religious symbol is the depiction of a naked woman known as a Sheela na Gig. This figure is sometimes found on medieval churches so its inclusion with religious symbolism is not out of place. There are a number of holes, sometimes directly beneath the sculptures, which are thought to have held candles or lamps which would have illuminated the carvings. Restoration In 2010, it was discovered that due to damp conditions in the cave insect larvae and worms were infesting and damaging the walls and carvings, and restoration works were initiated. In August 2014, it was reported that the work to remove the threat of the chalk-eating worms had been successful. James Robinson, cave manager, said: \\"Controlling the worm population presented a different challenge as it was felt unwise to use biocides or gas in a space like the cave which is regularly open to the public. The most practical approach was, therefore, to reduce the worms’ habitat. This involved removing the large volumes of soil and other debris at the base of the cave, particularly on the step below the carvings. Without their food the earthworms and brandling worms soon moved on\\". Repair work to water pipes was also carried out as water seeping into the cave had caused cracks to appear in the carvings. Traffic vibration from vehicles using the road above the cave could still cause problems if changes to road use were to occur. Despite the restoration, in November 2018, the Cave was added to Historic England's Heritage \\"at risk\\" register. It was the subsequently the subject of a BBC News television report.

Three major crises led to radical changes in all areas of society: demographic collapse, political instabilities and religious upheavals. A series of disasters, beginning with the Great Famine of 1315–17 and especially the Black Death of 1347-1351, reduced the population perhaps by half or more as the Medieval Warm Period came to a close and the first century of the Little Ice Age began. It took until 1500 for the European population to regain the levels of 1300. Popular revolts in late-medieval Europe and civil wars between nobles within countries such as the Wars of the Roses were common—with France fighting internally nine times—and there were international conflicts between kings such as France and England in the Hundred Years' War. The unity of the Roman Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. The Holy Roman Empire was also in decline; in the aftermath of the Great Interregnum (1247–1273), the Empire lost cohesion and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire.  Historiography  The expression \\"Crisis of the Late Middle Ages\\" is used commonly in western historiography, especially in English and German, and somewhat less among other western European scholarship to refer individually or collectively to different crises besetting Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. The expression often carries a modifier to refer more specifically to one or another aspect of Late Middle Age crisis, such as the Urban Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or the Cultural, Monastic, Religious, Social, Economic, Intellectual, or Agrarian crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or a national or regional modifier, e.g. Catalan or French crisis. By 1929, French historian Marc Bloch was already writing about the effects of the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, and by mid-century there were academic debates being held about it. In his 1981 article Late Middle Age Agrarian Crisis or Crisis of Feudalism?, Peter Kriedte reprises some of the early works in the field from historians writing in the 1930s, including Marc Bloch, Henri Pirenne, Wilhelm Abel, and Michael Postan. Kriedte references include: Referred to in Italian as the \\"Crisis of the 14th Century\\", Giovanni Cherubini alluded to the debate that already by 1974 had been going on \\"for several decades\\" in French, British, American, and German historiography. Arno Borst (1992) says that it \\"is a given that fourteenth century Latin Christianity was in a crisis\\", and goes on to say that the intellectual aspects and how universities were affected by the crisis is underrepresented in the scholarship hitherto: \\"When we discuss the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, we consider intellectual movements beside religious, social, and economic ones\\", and gives some examples. Some question whether \\"crisis\\" is the right expression for the period at the end of the Middle Ages and the transition to Modernity. In his 1981 article The End of the Middle Ages: Decline, Crisis or Transformation? Donald Sullivan addresses this question, claiming that scholarship has neglected the period and viewed it largely as a precursor to subsequent climactic events such as the Renaissance and Reformation. In his \\"Introduction to the History of the Middle Ages in Europe\\", Mitre Fernández wrote in 2004 that \\"[t]o talk about a general crisis of the Late Middle Ages is already a commonplace in the study of medieval history.\\" Heribert Müller, in his 2012 book on the religious crisis of the late Middle Ages, discussed whether the term itself was in crisis, saying, > No doubt the thesis of the crisis of the late Middle Ages has itself been in > crisis for some time now, and hardly anyone considered an expert in the > field would still profess it without some ifs and buts, and especially so in > the case of German Medieval historians. In his 2014 historiographical article about the crisis in the Middle Ages, Peter Schuster quotes historian Léopold Genicot's 1971 article \\"Crisis: From the Middle Ages to Modern Times\\" where Genicot wrote, \\"Crisis is the word which comes immediately to the historian's mind when he thinks of the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries.\\" Note: Schuster is quoting a 1971 republication of Genicot in \\"Cambridge Economic History of Europe, Vol 1, The Agrarian Life of the Middle Ages\\", which appeared previously in a 1966 version. Demography Some scholars contend that at the beginning of the 14th century, Europe had become overpopulated. By the 14th century frontiers had ceased to expand and internal colonization was coming to an end, but population levels remained high. The Medieval Warm Period ended sometime towards the end of the 13th century, bringing the \\"Little Ice Age\\"World Regions in Global Context, Third Edition and harsher winters with reduced harvests. In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy plough and the three-field system were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the Mediterranean because the north had poor, clay-like soil.J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, Medieval Europe: A Short History (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326. Food shortages and rapidly inflating prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay and consequently livestock, were all in short supply. Their scarcity resulted in malnutrition, which increases susceptibility to infections due to weakened immune systems. In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, which were the start of several years of cold and wet winters. The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. In the years 1315 to 1317 a catastrophic famine, known as the Great Famine, struck much of North West Europe. It was arguably the worst in European history, perhaps reducing the population by more than 10%. Genoese (red) and Venetian (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and Black Sea Most governments instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned black market speculators, set price controls on grain and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable and at worst they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain from France because of the prohibition, and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labor. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by pirates or looters to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their treasury and creating inflation. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what became known as the Hundred Years' War. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs such as Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350), raised the fines and rents of their tenants out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline. The European economy entered a vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the productivity of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. Standards of living fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems. When a typhoid epidemic emerged, many thousands died in populated urban centres, most significantly Ypres (now in Belgium). In 1318 a pestilence of unknown origin, sometimes identified as anthrax, targeted the animals of Europe, notably sheep and cattle, further reducing the food supply and income of the peasantry.  Climate change and the Great Famine  As Europe moved out of the Medieval Warm Period and into the Little Ice Age, a decrease in temperature and a great number of devastating floods disrupted harvests and caused mass famine. The cold and the rain proved to be particularly disastrous from 1315 to 1317 in which poor weather interrupted the maturation of many grains and beans and flooding turned fields rocky and barren. Scarcity of grain caused price inflation, as described in one account of grain prices in Europe in which the price of wheat doubled from twenty shillings per quarter in 1315 to forty shillings per quarter by June of the following year. Grape harvests also suffered, which reduced wine production throughout Europe. The wine production from the vineyards surrounding the Abbey of Saint-Arnould in France decreased as much as eighty percent by 1317. During this climatic change and subsequent famine, Europe's cattle were struck with Bovine Pestilence, a pathogen of unknown identity. The pathogen began spreading throughout Europe from Eastern Asia in 1315 and reached the British Isles by 1319. Manorial accounts of cattle populations in the year between 1319 and 1320, places a sixty-two percent loss in England and Wales alone. In these countries, some correlation can be found between the places where poor weather reduced crop harvests and places where the bovine population was particularly negatively affected. It is hypothesized that both low temperatures and lack of nutrition lowered the cattle populations' immune systems and made them vulnerable to disease. The mass death and illness of cattle drastically affected dairy production, and the output did not return to its pre-pestilence amount until 1331. Much of the medieval peasants' protein was obtained from dairy, and milk shortages likely caused nutritional deficiency in the European population. Famine and pestilence, exacerbated with the prevalence of war during this time, led to the death of an estimated ten to fifteen percent of Europe's population.  Climate change and plague pandemic correlation  The Black Death was a particularly devastating epidemic in Europe during this time, and is notable due to the number of people who succumbed to the disease within the few years the disease was active. It was fatal to an estimated thirty to sixty percent of the population where the disease was present. While there is some question of whether it was a particularly deadly strain of Yersinia pestis that caused the Black Death, research indicates no significant difference in bacterial phenotype. Thus environmental stressors are considered when hypothesizing the deadliness of the Black Plague, such as crop failures due to changes in weather, the subsequent famine, and an influx of host rats into Europe from China. The Black Death was so devastating that a comparable plague in terms of virulence had not been seen since the Justinian plague, before the Medieval warm period. This gap in plague activity during the Medieval Warm Period contributes to the hypothesis that climate conditions would have affected Europe's susceptibility to disease when the climate began to cool during the arrival of the Little Ice Age in the 13th century.  Popular revolt  Richard II of England meets the rebels of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Before the 14th century, popular uprisings were not unknown, for example, uprisings at a manor house against an unpleasant overlord, but they were local in scope. This changed in the 14th and 15th centuries when new downward pressures on the poor resulted in mass movements and popular uprisings across Europe. To indicate how common and widespread these movements became, in Germany between 1336 and 1525 there were no less than sixty phases of militant peasant unrest.Peter Blickle, Unruhen in der ständischen Gesellschaft 1300–1800, 1988 Political and religious factors The Battle of Aljubarrota between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Crown of Castile, 1385 The unity of the Roman Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. The Holy Roman Empire was also in decline in the aftermath of the Great Interregnum (1247–1273); the Empire lost cohesion, and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire. =Civil wars= * Wars of the Roses =International wars= * Hundred Years' War * Polish–Teutonic Wars * 1383–85 Crisis * Mongol raids against Russia * Burgundian Wars * Byzantine–Ottoman Wars * Ottoman wars in Europe Malthusian hypothesis Scholars such as David Herlihy and Michael Postan use the term Malthusian limit to express and explain some tragedies as resulting from overpopulation. In his 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population, Thomas Malthus asserted that eventually humans would reproduce so greatly that they would go beyond the limits of necessary resources; once they reach this point, catastrophe becomes inevitable. In his book, The Black Death and the Transformation of the West, professor David Herlihy explores this idea of plague as an inevitable crisis imposed on humanity to control the population and human resources. In the book The Black Death; A Turning Point in History? (ed. William M. Bowsky) he \\"implies that the Black Death's pivotal role in late medieval society ... was now being challenged. Arguing on the basis of a neo-Malthusian economics, revisionist historians recast the Black Death as a necessary and long overdue corrective to an overpopulated Europe.\\" Herlihy also examined the arguments against the Malthusian crisis, stating \\"if the Black Death was a response to excessive human numbers it should have arrived several decades earlier\\" in consequence of the population growth of years before the outbreak of the Black Death. Herlihy also brings up other, biological factors that argue against the plague as a \\"reckoning\\" by arguing \\"the role of famines in affecting population movements is also problematic. The many famines preceding the Black Death, even the 'great hunger' of 1315 to 1317, did not result in any appreciable reduction in population levels\\". Herlihy concludes the matter stating, \\"the medieval experience shows us not a Malthusian crisis but a stalemate, in the sense that the community was maintaining at stable levels very large numbers over a lengthy period\\" and states that the phenomenon should be referred to as more of a deadlock, rather than a crisis, to describe Europe before the epidemics.

It began publication in 1966 and stopped publishing in December 2005.  History  It began publication in 1966 under the ownership of the Sclafani family. Joseph was the Owner. Started as a \\"shopper\\" (merely a vehicle for advertising with little or no editorial content) under the name Cash Register, by the early 1970s it had grown into a small but important voice for Staten Islanders. The daily Staten Island Advance, one of the original papers in the Newhouse chain, had achieved near- saturation circulation and was perceived by many as being enmeshed with political incumbents, real estate developers and other entrenched interests. The Register offered a weekly \\"outsider's\\" take on important community news: politics, government, the environment, etc. The Staten Island Register was sold in August 2002 to Elauwit LLC, a company formed by Daniel McDonough of New Jersey. In February 2004, Elauwit sold the Register to Staten Island Media Group, LLC, run by Daniel Duman's York Street Partners, in 2004. The paper ceased publication in December 2005. At least partial collections of the paper are available in the New York Public Library Main Branch and the New York State Library in Albany.  Content  A string of editors, which included Fred Armentraut, Richard Regis, Jim Callaghan, William C. Franz, Joan Gerstel and Barbara Naness, emphasized four themes in the paper: investigative journalism, comprehensive coverage (Register articles on any particular issue often ran as series), background and analysis, and political independence. A premium was put on good explanatory pieces, and these editors made it a point of pride to avoid \\"dumbing down\\" stories. The paper also featured provocative editorials, which made it a bracing antidote to The Advance's more sedate style. As part of its commitment to what might be called aggressive political independence, the paper almost always carried at least one, and often three or four local, exclusive political columnists, but never endorsed a candidate in its editorials. Yet, the paper was always the subject of controversy. Register stories tended to fall into four categories: neighborhood issues that were either ignored or under-reported by other sources; environmental issues (Staten Island is an island, and the least developed of New York City's boroughs, so both marine and land use environmental issues were journalistically covered); governmental issues (since Staten Island is part of New York City and active in New York State politics, the paper made an effort to thoroughly cover the politics of city and state government as well as internal party politics in the borough); and \\"other\\" (which included everything from one of the first investigative series on the Willowbrook State School, an early story on \\"Joker Poker\\" video gambling, an exposé of labor issues on the local commuter railroad, and extensive coverage of veterans' issues). In addition to \\"hard news,\\" the paper was also well known for its extensive and in-depth articles on local history. A series on the history and operations of the New York City Fire Department in the 1980s, for instance, was packaged by the Fire Department's own press office into a sort of handbook for covering the Fire service, and long series on Staten Island's role in the Civil War and in the American Revolution won praise from local historians. Few months went by without some major historical piece in the paper during the 1980s and 1990s.

Future stars who appeared on the show included Pat Boone and Gladys Knight. Each episode usually featured eight acts. Viewers selected the winner, casting votes for their favorites by telephone or by mail. Each segment's winner was announced the next week. All contestants who won for three consecutive weeks appeared in an annual championship episode. Mack's style was decidedly more charitable than that of Bowes. The Major made a strong impression on a young Alan King, who had appeared on the Bowes program as a teen. He was discussing Bowes with Johnny Carson once, and suddenly stomped on the floor and yelled, \\"Can you hear me down there, Major Bowes?\\" suggesting that the late radio host had been consigned to Hell as punishment for his treatment of young performers.

It was headed by US Brigadier-General Robert A. McClure (who had previously commanded the Psychological Warfare Branch (PWB/AFHQ) of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff for Operation Torch). The Division was formed from staff of the US Office of War Information (OWI) and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the British Political Warfare Executive (PWE). The Division used radio and leaflet propaganda to undermine German soldiers' morale; with the bulk of the aerial propaganda leaflets being printed in the United Kingdom and a dedicated Special Leaflet Squadron of the US 8th Air Force disseminating the leaflets from its base in Cheddington, south-east England. Tactical Combat propaganda teams were also attached to the Army Groups to produce leaflets in the field on mobile printing presses for shell firing over the front line and to conduct loudspeaker operations to talk enemy soldiers into surrendering. PWD operated the Voice of SHAEF radio station as well as taking over Radio Luxembourg. 'Black propaganda' continued to be controlled by the Political Warfare Executive's Sefton Delmer.  Historical context  = History of psychological warfare in WWII = On July 11, 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) was created in Washington under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with Colonel William J. Donovan as the first director. This office was later separated into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Overseas Branch and the Office of War Information (OWI). These two offices were the first attempt at the establishment of an organized effort to promote espionage, propaganda, subversion, and any related activities under a centralized agency. On the British side, the most coordinated effort for psychological warfare was the Political Intelligence Department (PID). In Fall of 1942, after the COI was split into OSS and OWI, the PID agreed to issue a Joint Psychological Warfare Directive to combine efforts of the psychological warfare agencies in Britain and America. This Joint Directive remained the most prominent policy of the PWD until the end of its operations in July 1945. In November 1942, the Psychological Warfare Branch (AFHQ) was created as a joint military-civilian Anglo-American psychological warfare unit under the order of then General Dwight D. Eisenhower, attached to the Allied Force Headquarters after the Allied forces landed in French North Africa. After much trial and error with the structure and organization of the branch, it was transformed into the more coherent, and larger structure of the Psychological Warfare Division, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (PWD/SHAEF) in February 1944. = PWD/SHAEF = SHAEF remained the headquarters of the Commander of Allied Forces in northwest Europe, from late 1943 until the end of World War II on September 2, 1945, under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The goals of the PWD were to: # Wage psychological warfare against the enemy # Use various media to sustain the morale of people of friendly nations occupied by the enemy # Conduct propaganda directed toward a military force and designed to ensure compliance with the instructions of the commander of the occupying force # Control information services in Allied-occupied Germany The Publicity and Psychological Warfare Division (G-6) under Brig. Gen. Robert A. McClure was initiated by SHAEF in February 1944. McClure's original role was to coordinate all Allied press and psychological warfare agencies in northwest Europe. However, it ended up being split into two divisions just two months later. Psychological Warfare moved under the auspices of General McClure and Public Relations was under Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Davis. There were two categories of propaganda used: combat and strategic. Combat propaganda was tactical propaganda conducted in forward areas and toward smaller populations immediately behind enemy lines. Strategic propaganda sought to further more long-term, directed goals.Ibid., 6.  Leaflet Propaganda Front  Geneva and Hague Conventions on treatment of prisoners of war. Various kinds of leaflets were used throughout the operation. The most common leaflet came in the form of single flyers promoting one specific message. However, airborne newspapers were considered the most effective propaganda. The PID produced weekly newspapers “COURRIER DE L’AIR,” (AIR COURIER) soon followed by an American equivalent, “L’AMERIQUE EN GUERRE” (AMERICA AT WAR). They each consisted of four leaflet units, intended to keep the citizens of occupied France aware of the progress of the Allies. Later, other similar papers were produced for the people of other occupied countries, including “STERNENBANNER” (STARS AND STRIPES) which was disseminated in Germany. Propaganda was separated into three categories. “White” propaganda had its source clearly indicated, such as was the case with the “L’AMERIQUE EN GUERRE.” “Black” propaganda was used to cause the audience to believe the source was something other than what it really was. Finally, “gray” propaganda did not cite who was endorsing the message—this was the case in the daily paper “NACHRICHTEN FÜR DIE TRUPPE,” (NEWS FOR THE TROOPS) produced for German garrisons along the Atlantic Wall. \\"SAFE conduct passes\\" were also created by the PWD. These passes display Eisenhower's signature, and provided instructions for German soldiers on how to surrender. Oftentimes, the other side of the leaflet contained more immediate news or a tactical message.Ibid., 33. Overall, the leaflets aimed to reach two main audiences. The news directed toward the people of friendly, occupied countries came across in newspapers such as the “COURIER DE L’AIR,” and “L’AMERIQUE EN GUERRE.” In addition, leaflets were disseminated to inform citizens of how to react to dire circumstances, such as the invasion of Normandy. There were also leaflets produced for enemies, including German troops and civilians, and as time went on, foreign workers and prisoners of war in Germany. A four-language newspaper was distributed each night by SHAEF, and transmitted the Supreme Commander's instructions to the various displaced persons in Germany.Ibid., 66. According to the PWD/SHAEF, the leaflets were not argumentative, but instead were created to be objective and factual.Ibid., 70. Leaflet writing was done by the OWI and PID “in consultation with the PWD deputies, members of the Plans and Directives Section, members of the Leaflet Section, and the PWD G-2 and G-3 liaison officers.”Ibid., 34. Leaflets were written, keeping in mind the ever- changing military situation, the morale of the intended audience, production schedules, and distribution. Yet, the overall goal of the leaflets was to provide the “hard news of the military situation” and the “wishes of the supreme commander.”Ibid., 34. The agency of the special leaflet squadron was used to disseminate leaflets. Between 1944-1945, the 8th Air Force distributed 80 percent of all leaflets in the areas of the Anglo-American armies. Ten percent was disseminated by the Royal Air Force, 5 percent by fighter bombers of the tactical air forces, and 5 percent by artillery (field guns and Howitzers).Ibid., 38. The 422nd Bomb Squadron of the 8th Air Force originally released leaflets from large boxes of a B-17 Flying Fortress flying at 30,000 feet. They took into account the 60 mph winds and released leaflets over Brussels in order for them to land near Paris. The boxes used for this mission were converted luggage carriers obtained from the Air Transport Command.Ibid., 35. The smallest quantity of leaflets that could be released at one time using this method was about 350,000. Though this method of dissemination was large scale, it did not facilitate accuracy of where the leaflets would land.Ibid., 35. = Leaflet bombs = On February 4, 1944, the first leaflet “bomb” was tested. The bombs were created with cardboard M-17 containers, equipped with mechanical time fuses. Each container contained approximately 80,000 leaflets, and they were released from 10,000 feet. This method of dissemination was deemed a vast improvement from previous, and was generally implemented thereafter. Future directives of the United States Strategic Air Forces required the depot in Bedfordshire, England to produce 1,000 bombs per month and that aircraft be loaded with leaflets to be dispatched with each mission conducted over Germany.Ibid., 36. = Leaflet shells = Leaflets were rolled and inserted into shells to be launched via artillery—specifically Howitzer guns. The 105mm shell carried 500 leaflets, while the 155mm shell carried 1500 leaflets.Ibid., 38.  Filming  The famous director Alexander Mackendrick, who later went on to enjoy considerable success at Ealing Studios, had some of his earliest experience of working in film with the division. John Huston and Eric Ambler, as a token British representative, also made a film for the PWD about civilian Italy under its new conquerors. The Italian-Swiss documentary Giorni di gloria (1945, co-directed by Giuseppe De Santis, Luchino Visconti, Marcello Pagliero and film editor Mario Serandrei, was also made with collaboration of the PWD Film Division.

At the same time, early steps were being taken to use them in active combat at sea and on land, but battlefield unmanned aerial vehicles would not come into their own until the 1980s.  History  UAVs, such as the Northrop Falconer, had been developed for battlefield reconnaissance beginning in the 1950s, but these machines saw little or no combat service. Israelis pioneered the operational use of battlefield UAVs in the early 1980s, during their operations in southern Lebanon. Very few of the technologies they used were all that new, but the Israelis finally achieved the proper formula for operational success, using their battlefield UAVs to help destroy Syrian surface-to-air missile sites and assist in other combat operations. With the successes in southern Lebanon, international interest in battlefield UAVs picked up significantly. During the 1980s, all the major military powers and many of the minor ones acquired a battlefield UAV capability, and continue to expand that capability. These battlefield UAVs fall into two broad categories, which can be designated for convenience as \\"combat surveillance\\" and \\"tactical reconnaissance\\" UAVs.  Combat surveillance UAV  The function of a combat surveillance UAV is to observe events on a battlefield in real-time, orbiting over the battle area and relaying intelligence to a ground control station. They are generally powered by small rotary or two-stroke piston \\"chain saw\\" engines. They are directed by an autopilot system with RC backup. The autopilot directs the aircraft from sets of waypoints programmed in before takeoff. The flight-plan is set up by displaying a map on a workstation, clicking on the desired map coordinates with a mouse or directly on to a touch-screen, and then uploading the flight-plan into the UAV. Navigation is often verified by a GPS-INS navigation system. However, combat surveillance UAVs usually use the autopilot to get to the operating area, with the aircraft then operating by radio control to find targets of opportunity. The need to stay within radio range restricts combat surveillance UAVs to ranges within a line-of-sight of the transmitter. This is usually the determining factor in \\"range\\" specifications for such UAVs. For this reason, \\"endurance\\" is a more useful specification than \\"range\\". The UAV sensors are generally housed in a turret underneath the aircraft, and almost always feature day-night imagers. The turret may also include a laser designator to allow the UAV to mark targets for smart weapons. Other specialized payloads, such as SIGINT packages, or new lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR)sensors with all-weather imaging capability, are now being fielded as well. The larger combat surveillance UAVs have landing gear, usually fixed, and can take off and land on an unimproved airstrip, with an arresting hook to snag a cable for short landings. Such UAVs may also be launched by a RATO booster, and recovered by parachute, parasail, or by flying into a net. Smaller combat surveillance UAVs may be launched with a pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric catapult, with the very smallest launched by an elastic-bungee catapult. Tactical reconnaissance UAV The tactical reconnaissance UAV is usually larger, jet powered, with longer range and higher speed. Like a combat surveillance UAV, it has an autopilot with radio control backup, but it relies more on the autopilot than on radio control, since its primary mission is to fly over predesignated targets out of line of sight, take pictures, and then come home. The tactical reconnaissance UAV will usually not loiter over the battle area, and real-time intelligence is less essential. A tactical reconnaissance UAV usually carries day-night reconnaissance cameras, rather than a sensor turret, though SAR can be carried as well. They are generally launched by RATO booster and recovered by parachute, though they can be launched from aircraft as well. The dividing line between combat surveillance and tactical reconnaissance UAVs, as well as between them and other classes of UAVs, is fuzzy. Some types of UAV may be usable for both missions. The distinction between a combat surveillance UAV and some kinds of \\"endurance\\" UAVs, discussed later, and between a tactical reconnaissance and a strategic reconnaissance UAV, as discussed earlier, is also very thin. There are also many variations on themes. The smaller combat surveillance UAVs, in the size range of a large hobbyist RC model plane and used to support military forces at the brigade or battalion level, are sometimes called \\"mini-UAVs\\", and their low cost makes them particularly suitable for \\"expendable\\" missions. Such expendable missions might involve carrying a jammer payload into an enemy's operational area to disrupt radar and communications, or even being fitted with a radar seeker and a warhead to attack enemy radars. Such an \\"attack drone\\" or \\"harassment UAV\\" now becomes difficult to logically distinguish from a cruise missile. The DASH Helicopter Drones / SEAMOS The first operational battlefield UAV developed by the US military was for antisubmarine warfare (ASW). In the early 1960s, the US Navy obtained a small \\"Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter\\" (DASH) Gyrodyne QH-50 that could fly off a frigate or destroyer to carry homing torpedoes or nuclear depth charges for attacks on enemy submarines that were out of range of the ship's other weapons. This was a relatively simple requirement, involving a neatly defined mission in a combat environment where presumably nobody would usually be shooting back at the drone, and it seemed achievable with the technology of the time. Gyrodyne Company of Long Island, New York, was awarded the contract to build DASH, and based the design on a one-man helicopter the company had already developed, the \\"YRON-1\\". The initial DASH demonstration prototype, designated the \\"DSN-1\\", used a Porsche flat-four piston engine with , with nine such prototypes built. Initial flights were in the summer of 1961, at first with a pilot on board, leading up to an unpiloted helicopter flight in August 1961. A second-generation prototype, the \\"DSN-2\\", was powered by two Porsche engines, each with . Three such drones were built, and then led to the production DASH, the \\"DSN-3\\", which was powered by a Boeing T50-BO-8A turboshaft engine with 225 kW (300 shp). First flight of the DSN-3 was also in the summer of 1961. The US military services adopted a common aircraft designation scheme in 1962, and the DASH variants were given new designations. The DSN-1 became the \\"QH-50A\\", the DSN-2 became the \\"QH-50B\\", and the DSN-3 became the \\"QH-50C\\". The general configuration of all three of the DASH prototype variants was similar, though the QH-50C was scaled up, with an empty weight almost twice that of the QH-50A. The QH-50C was an ugly little machine that was reminiscent of an insect. It had a frame made of steel tubing, with all machinery directly accessible, and stood on twin skids, with one or two homing torpedoes or nuclear depth charges carried between the skids. It had a coaxial rotor system and a dropdown inverted vee tail. The QH-50C had a height of , a rotor diameter of , and an empty weight of 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). It was guided solely by radio control, and had neither sensors nor autonomous navigation capability. Combat radius was a modest , which was adequate for its mission. Greater range would not have been very useful, as the DASH flew at low altitude and used a line-of-sight communications link, limiting its range in any case. The US Navy originally ordered 900 QH-50Cs, but the type suffered from reliability problems, with a quarter of the first batch of 100 lost in crashes. The order was cut to a little over 500, with final production being the \\"QH-50D\\" variant, with an uprated engine providing 274 kW (365 shp), fiberglass rotors, and increased fuel capacity. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force also bought a small batch of 16 DASHes in 1968. The career of the DASH was undistinguished, but it was one of the first drones ever used in a strictly tactical environment, and pointed the way to the future. A small number of DASHes were apparently given reconnaissance gear and used for naval surveillance over the Gulf of Tonkin in 1966 in a project codenamed SNOOPY. In the early 1970s the Air Force evaluated the QH-50D for a battlefield drone test program codenamed NITE GAZELLE. NITE GAZELLE apparently experimented with using drones to drop bomblets and carry machine guns, but details are unclear, as are reports that the DASH was used in other evaluations as a countermeasures platform. In the 1980s, Aerodyne corporation attempted to sell an updated version of the DASH, designated the \\"CH-84 Pegasus\\", with an Allison 250-C20F turboshaft engine and updated electronics. While it appears the Pegasus was not a success, the DASH was resurrected a second time in the 1990s by the German Dornier company, now part of Daimler Chrysler, for the \\"SEAMOS\\" naval UAV. SEAMOS SEAMOS owed much to DASH, and in fact a modified QH-50D was used as the SEAMOS demonstrator prototype. Like the original DASH, SEAMOS was a coaxial-rotor drone helicopter with twin landing skids, though it was unsurprisingly a more refined system, and in particular even had a real fuselage. SEAMOS was powered by an Allison 250-C20W turboshaft engine with 315 kW (420 shp). SEAMOS flight tests were performed with the technology demonstrator in 1991, leading to a production contract in 1996 and flight tests of a true prototype in 1999. Service introduction was expected in 2005, but the program was cancelled in early 2003, SEAMOS having been judged \\"overdesigned and too expensive\\". The German government put out a request for an off-the-shelf solution, sensibly stating specifications in line with a machine that they could afford. The EADS Orka-1200, discussed later, is the prime candidate. EXDRONE During the Gulf War, the US Marines also used about 60 cheap battlefield mini-UAVs, the \\"BQM-174 Exdrone (Expendable Drone)\\", that were fitted with simple TV camera payloads for battlefield reconnaissance. The Exdrone was built by BAI Aerosystems of Maryland. It was mostly made of styrofoam, balsa wood, and plastics, and was powered by a chainsaw engine. It was a \\"symmetrical delta\\", meaning it didn't matter if it flew upside-down, allowing it to offer some protection to its payload when necessary. A later version was the BQM-147 Dragon. BRAVE 200 While the Army was floundering with the Aquila, the Air Force was going through its own struggles with the tactical UAV concept. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory, working with Teledyne Ryan, developed a piston-powered tactical UAV designated the \\"XBQM-26 Teleplane\\". A total of 23 were built, in 13 different configurations. It is unclear if there was ever any intent to adopt the XBQM-26 for operational service, since the program had a strongly experimental flavor, with the different configurations used to evaluate a wide range of possibilities for tactical UAV operations. The program ended in the mid-1980s. However, the Air Force did conduct a program to obtain an operational tactical UAV, the \\"Boeing Robotic Air Vehicle (BRAVE) 200\\". The BRAVE 200 was intended to be used as an antiradar attack drone, a jamming platform, or for other expendable battlefield missions. The BRAVE 200 was a neat little canard machine, with a span of , a length of , and a launch weight of . It was powered by a two- stroke, two-cylinder engine, driving a pusher propeller. The BRAVE 200 had an interesting launch scheme, with 15 of the UAVs stowed in a transport \\"box\\". A drone was shoved out of its cell in the box on an arm, and then launched by a RATO booster. It was recovered by parachute if the mission allowed it be recovered. The BRAVE 200 effort began in 1983, when the company received a USAF contract to develop an anti-radar attack drone, under the designation \\"YCQM-121A Pave Tiger\\". 14 prototypes were flown in 1983 and 1984, but the program was cancelled in late 1984. It did not stay cancelled. In 1987, the USAF awarded Boeing a contract to develop an improved version of the drone, designated the \\"YGCM-121B Seek Spinner\\", as a loitering antiradar attack drone. The YGCM-121B was generally similar to the YCQM but heavier, with a weight of . The Air Force also evaluated another variant in the series, designated the \\"CEM-138 Pave Cricket\\", with a jamming payload. However, both Air Force programs were axed in 1989. Boeing continued to promote the BRAVE 200 to other customers, and also tried to sell a jet-powered drone, the \\"BRAVE 3000\\". The BRAVE 3000 resembled a small cruise missile with boxy fuselage, a straight wing that pivoted into launch configuration, cruciform tailfins, a belly fin forward of the wing, and an engine intake under the belly. The BRAVE 3000 also featured a container launch scheme, and had a launch weight of 285 kilograms (629 pounds) with RATO booster. A few prototypes were flown in the mid-1980s. Nobody bought either the BRAVE 200 or the BRAVE 3000, and both projects were abandoned. Over a decade later, Boeing would return to the small UAV field by teaming up with the Insitu Group on the ScanEagle UAV, discussed later. Hunter / Sky Owl With UAV efforts floundering, in the late 1980s the US Congress formed the \\"Joint Program Office (JPO)\\" to consolidate UAV programs. JPO was a branch of the Naval Air Systems Command, but obtained funding directly from the office of the Secretary of Defense, at the top of the US defense hierarchy. One of the first UAV programs begun by the JPO was the \\"Short Range UAV\\" program, which in 1988 selected the Hunter UAV, which was built by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) in cooperation with TRW. The Hunter first flew in 1991. It had a general configuration not much different from the Pioneer, except that it was bigger and had twin engines, consisting of two Moto-Guzzi piston engines arranged in on both ends of center fuselage in a \\"push-me-pull-you\\" configuration. It had a turret with a TV/FLIR imager mounted on the belly. The original plan was to acquire 50 Hunter battlefield observation systems, with four aircraft and ground control gear in each system, for a total of US$1.6 billion. The aircraft was given the Army designation of \\"BQM-155A\\". Initial evaluation determined that the Hunter's range was inadequate, its data link was unsatisfactory, and the aircraft was too big to fit into the transport aircraft defined in the original specification. Despite these deficiencies, a low rate initial production (LRIP) contract for seven systems at a price of US$171 million was placed in 1993. Further evaluation of the Hunter based on these seven systems demonstrated more shortcomings in the UAV's software, data link, and engine. As the Hunter's defects were gradually uncovered, price continued to rise, and by 1996 the Army was faced with paying over US$2 billion for 52 Hunter systems. Hunter was cancelled. By the time of its cancellation, 20 Hunters had been lost in crashes. The cancellation of the Hunter program did not mean that the Hunters in service were discarded, and in fact they proved surprisingly useful and were even sent on operational missions. The Hunters were employed by the US Army, Air Force, and Navy on experimental programs; provided training in the development of operational concepts for the day when a more effective UAV system was available; and evaluated use of UAVs for communications relay and electronic warfare (EW) missions. In the spring of 1999, eight surviving Hunters, redesignated \\"RQ-5A\\", were sent to Albania to support OPERATION ALLIED FORCE, the NATO air campaign against Serbia. The Hunters were flown out of Macedonia, and were able to provide real-time video to senior officers directing ALLIED FORCE, with the video relayed through a ground station, then through a satellite to the US, and finally distributed to end users. NATO commander Wesley Clark used the video feeds and on a few occasions contacted the Hunter operations team directly. The operations team also could adjust their missions in real time in response to inputs from the ALLIED FORCE air operations headquarters. The Hunters flew 281 sorties during ALLIED FORCE. They spotted targets such as air defense radars, artillery, and missile launchers, and usually stayed on station during attacks to perform post-strike damage assessment. The Hunters were able to operate much lower than manned aircraft, which were restricted to minimum safe operating altitudes. Two Hunters were damaged and sent back to the US for repair, one flew into a mountain, and five were lost in action, apparently shot down. The operations team received six replacements. In fact, the Hunter has proven so useful that the Army plans to buy more of them, suggesting that reports of its death in 1996 were greatly exaggerated. In 2002, the Army performed experiments with the Hunter in which it was used to drop \\"Brilliant Antiarmor Munitions (BATs)\\", a \\"smart\\" antitank glide weapon that features an acoustic / infrared seeker, as an experiment towards introduction of a more formal armed UAV system for the Army. A test drop of four BATs performed in early October 2002 scored three direct hits on armored vehicle targets, with one of the three blowing the turret off the tank it struck. In late March 2003, a Hunter also performed drops of a BAT derivative named \\"Viper Strike\\" that was fitted with a laser seeker, with nine drops resulting in seven hits. The Army would like to evaluate other munitions, such as the Hellfire antitank missile, on the Hunter. The Air Force is supposed to provide fixed-wing battlefield air close support for the Army, but the Army has always wanted to have air close support assets of its own, and apparently sees the armed Hunter as a way of skirting around the USAF charter. Hunters served in the US invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 and the subsequent occupation of the country. By the summer of 2004, the type had achieved a total of 30,000 flight hours in US Army service, not bad for an aircraft that was formally \\"canned\\". The Army is trying to find funds to buy 14 more Hunters. Since the original Moto-Guzzi engine fitted to the Hunter is no longer in production, this new batch will use a new heavy-fuel engine, and will also feature a number of other improvements. OUTRIDER Although the Hunter proved very useful almost in spite of itself, the Army still needed a formal operational battlefield UAV system. In 1996, on the cancellation of the Hunter, the Army went through its third attempt to procure a battlefield UAV with the Alliant Techsystems Outrider. The Outrider was based on the Mission Technologies \\"Hellfox\\" UAV, which had flown the year before. The Outrider was a relatively small battlefield UAV that featured an unusual \\"dual wing\\", meaning it was a biplane with the wings staggered and joined at the ends. It was powered by a four- cylinder piston engine driving a pusher propeller, had fixed landing gear, and a pancake-shaped data link antenna on its back. The Outrider was another fiasco. The military demanded a wide range of major changes to the Hellfox, such changing airframe construction from composites to aluminum, and the effort never managed to converge to a solution. After continuous problems and a failure to meet specifications, the Outrider was cancelled in 1999, the same year it was formally designated the \\"RQ-6A\\". While it is difficult to understand why the Army had such difficulty obtaining what would seem to be a relatively simple technology, part of the problem seems to be specsmanship. The Israelis were able to make use of battlefield UAVs quickly because they had simple requirements. The weather in the Middle East is generally hot, sunny, and clear, and the Israelis have a relatively fixed set of adversaries who mostly live right on their border. In contrast, the US Army may be forced to operate almost anywhere and against anyone, meaning that a system that would be satisfactory to the Israelis would not be adequate for the US Army. The US Army necessarily had more demanding specifications. This was unavoidable, but it also opened the door to adding ever more specifications, a bureaucratic process known as \\"feature creep\\" that can squeeze the life out a project. Along with over-specification, there seems to have been a degree of bumbling as well. The seeming simplicity of a UAV is misleading. Studies of the difficulties encountered in Army UAV programs indicate that participants tended to underestimate the complexity of a UAV system, starting out thinking that UAVs are little more than glorified RC model airplanes, and then were overwhelmed as problems mounted. On the other hand, some defense engineers approached UAVs with the same mindset as they would use for building a piloted aircraft, causing costs to skyrocket. There also seems to have been problems from inter-service squabbling and Congressional micromanagement. After the development contract was awarded, the Pentagon decided that Outrider had to meet both Army and Navy requirements. This meant increasing the UAV's range by a factor of four, to allow ships to see targets over the horizon, and specifying an engine that ran on diesel fuel, not gasoline, which is too flammable to store on a naval vessel except when the need absolutely demands it. The engine effort was a fiasco. US Navy UAV efforts seem to have gone better partly because of high-level interest in the project. The original Navy request that resulted in procurement of the Pioneer UAV was a personal initiative of Navy Undersecretary John Lehman. Not only does having such a prominent patron eliminate obstacles, it also encourages program officials to greater efforts, since they know their actions have high-level visibility. The Army efforts, in contrast, have often lacked patrons or high-level commitment. However, the Navy has been criticized for becoming involved with programs like Outrider, changing the requirements drastically to fit their needs, and then walking off. In addition, the Navy's long and difficult search for an antiship missile target, discussed earlier, suggests that the Army has no particular copyright on bumbling. Further consideration of the matter leads into a tangle of bureaucracy best avoided.

He was the developer of a nickel catalyst that became known as Raney nickel, which is often used in industrial processes and scientific research for the hydrogenation of multiple covalent bonds present in molecules. Biography Raney was born in Carrollton, Kentucky, to William Wallace and Katherine Raney. Without having attended high school,W.R. Grace & Co. (2004) History Murray Raney . Retrieved December 25, 2005. he obtained his Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Kentucky in 1909. Following his graduation he became a teacher at the Eastern Kentucky State Normal College and was also in charge of the heating and lighting facilities there until 1910. From 1910 until 1911 he worked in the beater room of the Fort Orange Paper Company in Castleton-on- Hudson, New York. In 1911 he moved to Springfield, Illinois to work in the production of steam engines at A. L. Ide Engine Company, where he stayed until 1913. That same year he moved to his final residence in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to work for the Chattanooga Railway, Light & Power Co as a power salesman. Raney joined the Lookout Oil & Refining Company in 1915. He was assigned to work as an assistant manager in the production of hydrogen used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. It was during this time he started to work in the preparation of what later became known as \\"Raney\\" catalysts. He left Lookout Oil in 1925 to take a sales manager position at Gilman Paint and Varnish Co., eventually becoming president of the company. In 1950 he left Gilman Paint and founded the Raney Catalyst Company. He then started to dedicate full-time to the production of his catalysts. This company was bought by W.R. Grace and Company in 1963 and still produces Raney nickel to this day. Raney was twice married, first on June 12, 1920, to Katherine Elizabeth Macrae (d. June 13, 1935) with whom he had one daughter. His second marriage was to Laura Ogden McClellan (d. April 13, 1953) on March 31, 1939. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1951. He was member of the American Chemical Society and the American Oil Chemists' Society. He was granted a total of six American and five European patents for the development of his catalysts and metallurgical processes needed for their preparation. Development of Raney nickel During his time at Lookout Oil and Refining Raney was responsible for the production of hydrogen which was used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. During that time the industry used a nickel catalyst prepared from nickel(II) oxide. Believing that better catalysts could be produced, around 1921 he started to perform independent research on this matter while still working for Lookout Oil. In 1924 he produced an approximately 1:1 nickel-silicon alloy which, after being treated with sodium hydroxide to remove the silicon, was found to be five times more active than the best catalyst used in the hydrogenation of cottonseed oil. He was granted a US patent for this discovery in 1925.Raney, Murray (1925). \\"Method of Preparing Catalytic Material \\". US Patent 1563587, issued 1925-12-01. To this, Raney himself said in an interview \\"I was just lucky... I had an idea for a catalyst and it worked the first time.\\" In 1926 Raney produced a nickel- aluminium alloy, also in a 1:1 ratio, following a procedure similar to the one used for the nickel-silicon alloy, and he found that the resulting catalyst was even more active than the previous one. This catalyst, now commonly known as Raney nickel, was the subject of a patent he obtained in 1927.Raney, Murray (1927). \\"Method of producing Finely Divided Nickel \\". US Patent 1628190, issued 1927-05-10 It may be of interest to note that Raney's choice of the nickel-aluminium ratio was fortuitous and without any real scientific basis. However, this is the preferred alloy composition for production of Raney nickel catalysts currently in use. The Murray Raney Award In 1992 the Organic Reactions Catalysis Society (ORCS) created the Murray Raney Award \\"for contributions in the use of sponge metal catalysts in organic synthesis\\".

The school was previously granted specialist science school status for which it received additional funding. However the school remained a comprehensive school, and did not take the option available to specialist schools to select a proportion of its pupils. Though the school does not provide higher education through sixth-form, it has links with both the Basingstoke College of Technology (BCoT) and Queen Mary's College (QMC), where the majority of pupils continue education after the age of 16. In 2019 the school had 980 pupils out of a rated capacity of 1,075, according to the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED). Pupils come from a catchment area which includes the nearby town of Tadley and the villages of Silchester, Bramley, Sherborne St John and Pamber Heath.

As part of the Chicago Deep Tunnel project, both Thornton Quarry and McCook Quarry will serve as reservoirs to reduce the backflow of stormwater and sewage from Chicago area rivers into Lake Michigan. Thornton Transitional Reservoir contributes a capacity to the system, and is expected to contribute when the system is completed in 2014. It is estimated that the reservoir will help protect 500,000 people who live in the surrounding 14 suburbs it serves, and will save the city around $40 million worth of damages each year. The quarry contains Silurian reefs which formed when the Michigan Basin was covered in sea water more than 400 million years ago. http://www.earthscape.org/t2/scr01/scr01ac.html History The first settlers came to Thornton, Illinois, in 1834. Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard received 160 acres of land from Shabonna, his Indian wife. In 1836 Hubbard opened the first quarry on Kinzie Street. The site was abandoned because the stone was too deep and of poor quality. Fred Gardner opened a quarry in 1846, and Stephen Crary opened one in 1850. In the early 1900s, Brownell Improvement Company purchased the entire area. Colonel Hodgkins bought the property in 1920. The quarry north of Ridge Road was opened in 1924, and a tunnel connecting the north and south quarries was developed in 1926. Colonel Hodgkins died in 1929, and Brownell repurchased the quarry in 1933. Then in 1938, Material Service Corporation purchased the property and has owned it ever since.

Considered as the first pop singer of South Asia, he sang South Asia's first pop song, Ko Ko Korina, in the 1966 film Armaan . Born in Hyderabad Deccan, he migrated to Pakistan following partition. In 1954, he recorded the official National anthem of Pakistan with several other singers. Rushdi has recorded the highest number of film songs in the history of Pakistani cinema in Urdu, English, Punjabi, Bengali, Sindhi and Gujarati and found unprecedented success as a playback artist from the mid-1950s to early 1980s. He was also known for his stage performance. He suffered from poor health during the latter part of his life and died of a heart attack at the age of 48, after recording approximately five thousand film songs for 583 released films. Besides popular music, Rushdi also helped popularize the ghazals of Naseer Turabi. He was awarded five Nigar Awards, the \\"Best Singer Of The Millennium\\" title, \\"Life Time Achievement Award\\", \\"Legend Award\\" and Lux Style Award. In 2003, 20 years after his death, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf awarded him the Sitara-e-Imtiaz, the \\"star of excellence,\\" for distinguished merit in the field of arts. According to the 2016 survey of Asian Woman Magazine, Rushdi is declared as a darling singer of all time.  Early life  Ahmed Rushdi was born to a religious, conservative family of Hyderabad Deccan in 1934. His father, Syed Manzoor Mohammad, taught Arabic, Islamic History and Persian at Aurangabad College, Hyderabad, Deccan. He died when Rushdi was only six years old. From a young age, Rushdi was fond of listening to the musical programs, including songs, which were broadcast from the radio. He neither inherited music from any one, nor any body in his family was ever affiliated to music. Ahmed Rushdi's singing talents impressed a very close friend of his father, whom he called uncle and who loved him dearly. He enrolled in a local music academy in Hyderabad Deccan. Moreover, two popular composers of the time, M.A. Rauf and Iqbal Qureshi, also taught music in the same school. Thus, Ahmed Rushdi learned the basics of music from the afore- mentioned teachers. Later, he got some training in classical music from Ustad Nathu Khan. Ahmed Rushdi did not get any sort of formal training of classical music neither before nor after becoming a successful playback singer but he had an effective command over high and low notes. He sang his first song in the Indian film Ibrat in 1951 and got recognition. His family moved to Pakistan and settled in Karachi in 1954, where he began participating in variety shows, music programs, and children's programs on radio. In 1954, he recorded his first non-film song, \\"Bunder Road se Keemari\\", written by Mehdi Zaheer for the popular Radio Pakistan show Bachchon Ki Duniya; the song was a hit and became the steppingstone for Rushdi's future. Singing career =1950s and 1960s= After the success of \\"Bunder Road se Keemari\\", Rushdi was offered songs as a playback singer for films and quickly gained popularity. He lent his voice to many hit films like Bara Admi (1956), Wah Rey Zamaney (1957), Raat Ke Rahi (1957), Yeh Dunya (1958) and many more. Rushdi got well recognition for singing \\"Mari lela ne aisi\\" in Anokhi (1956), \\"Chalak Rahi Hain Mastiyan\\" and \\"Chal Na Sakey Gi 420\\" in Raaz (1959). In 1961, he sang the popular song \\"Chand Sa Mukhra Gora Badan\\" in the film Saperan, for which he received his first Nigar Award as Best Male Playback Singer. He further strengthened his status as one of the top male playback singers in Mehtaab (1962), in which he sang \\"Gol Gappay Wala Aaya\\" for actor Alauddin; they would again be teamed in Susral. In 1966, he sang \\"Ko Ko Korina\\", considered the first modern Pakistani pop song.Munzir Elahi and Anjum Zia, \\"Pakistan,\\" in p. 389. The film Anchal (1960) was an important film in Rushdi's career. Music director Khalil Ahmed recorded an extremely sad number \\"Kisi chaman mei raho tum\\" in singer Saleem Raza's voice but wanted Rushdi to re-record the song as he was not satisfied with Saleem Raza's singing. Rushdi did so and the song recorded in his voice satisfied composer Khalil. Raza's career as a singer was affected and doomed later on. After that, whenever Khalil composed music for any film, Rushdi remained his first choice. The mid-1960s saw the rise of brilliant singers like Mehdi Hassan and Masood Rana, but it did not affect Rushdi's career and he kept on leading the film music. Rushdi during a live performance Music experts including Nisar Bazmi, Sohail Rana and M. Ashraf are unanimous that Rushdi's voice was best suited for every hero, comedian and even character actor. He lent his voice to Waheed Murad, Nadeem, Mohammad Ali, Santosh Kumar, Darpan, Habib, Rehman, Shahid, Qavi Khan, Ghulam Mohiuddin, Rahat Kazmi and was tailor-made for every actor of film industry. Rushdi's voice was even ideally suited to comedians such as Munawar Zarif, Lehri, Nirala, Nanha and Rangeela. Rushdi recorded the ghazal \\"Shok-e- awargi\\" written by poet Habib Jalib for actor Syed Kamal in the 1963 film Joker. This ghazal sung by Rushdi, gained popularity amongst music listeners. Rushdi and Jalib again teamed together for Mohammad Ali in the film Khamosh Raho (1964). Rushdi sang the ghazal \\"Mei Nahi Manta\\" for the same film and gained Habib Jalib country-wide fame. He recorded a qawwali \\"Madiney waley ko mera salam kehdena\\" along with Munir Husain same year. Actor Nadeem's first film as a leading actor was Chakori (1967). Rushdi recorded four songs for this film in the composition of music director Robin Ghosh. \\"Kabhi toe tum ko yaad ayen gi\\", \\"Pyare pyare yar humare\\" and \\"Tujhe chahein meri bahein\\". Same year, film Doraha and Shehnai were released.

In 1968, Rushdi recorded his first ever Bengali song in the film Notun Name Dako of Dhaka titled \\"Ke Tumi Ele Go\\", which became a smashing hit in the then East Pakistan. He sang playback hits in the same year like \\"Ae mere diwaney dil\\" (film Jahan tum wahan hum), \\"Socha tha pyar na karein ge\\" (film Ladla), \\"Usey dekha usey chaha usey bhool gaye\\" (film Jahan tum wahan hum), \\"Teri aankhon ke bheegey sitarey\\" (film Ma Beta) and many more.

Ahmed Rushdi recorded all the songs for Waheed Murad in this film. The song \\"Kuch log rooth ker bhi\\" was a hit. Its sad version was sung by Noor Jahan. Although he sang for every film hero in Pakistan, his pairing with Waheed Murad proved to be the most popular, in such movies as Armaan (1966); the song \\"Akele Na Jaana\\" from that movie in Sohail Rana's composition gained Rushdi another Nigar Award. Well-known hits of Rushdi picturised on Waheed Murad such as \\"Lag rahi hai mujhey aaj sari faza ajnabi\\" or \\"Kuchh loag rooth kar bi\\" were composed by Nisar Bazmi, the legendary composer for Pakistani movies.

He was also fond of acting and appeared in thirteen films as an actor including Anokhi (1956), Kaneez (1965), Saat Lakh (1967) and Dekha Jaye Ga (1976). He also composed a music album in singer Mujeeb Aalam's voice. In 1974, film Anhoni was released. Waheed Murad and Aliya were in leading roles. Music director Lal Mohammad Iqbal recorded two songs in Rushdi's voice. \\"Hai kahan who kali\\" and a sad number \\"Mei tujhey Nazar kia doon\\". In the same year he sang for actor Shahid in film Dharkan. He recorded a romantic number \\"Rangat gulabi chehra kitabi\\" for Shahid. In 1975, Ahmed Rushdi recorded \\"Dil ko jalana hum ne chor diya\\" (Film Mohabbat Zindagi Hai). This song was picturised on Waheed Murad and gained country wide popularity. He sang another song \\"Mashriqi rang ko chor ke\\" for the same film. He recorded many songs for Pakistan television including \\"Dil mei tu hai\\", \\"Han issi mor pe\\" and \\"Bheegey hue mousam mei\\". Film Sharmeeli (1978) was his last movie with actor Nadeem as a playback singer. It was a successful musical film and songs gained popularity among the masses. Rushdi recorded two songs for Nadeem, \\"Tu samney hai mere\\" and \\"Bheegey hue mousam mei\\". Same year he recorded a popular song for Mohammad Ali \\"Aagey aagey mohtarma peechey peechey mohtram\\" (Film Apka Khadim). He sang a classical number \\"Tere naina barey chit chor\\" for the film Jab Jab Phool Khiley next year. He also sang in films like Accident, Achey Mian, Bohut Khoob, Baarat and Aag Aur Zindagi. The year 1980 proved to be a nightmare for Pakistan film industry. The number of Urdu films decreased rapidly and the era of Punjabi films started. In those films there was a very little room available for male playback singers as those movies were completely dominated by the songs in mostly female voices. Immediately following the military installation of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq as President, measures were put in place to limit the distribution of music and the only source of entertainment was the government-owned television network Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV). While music videos were banned in the country. Rushdi sang in films like Farzana, Hanstey Aansoo, Haseena Maan Jaye Gi etc. but his glorious singing career was almost coming to an end. Rushdi was not only singing for films, but he was equally a busy figure for Radio and Television also. He remained a leading singer between 1954 and 1983. He sang for all the famous actors of Pakistan film industry. Rushdi recorded his last song \\"Ban ke misra ghazal ka\\" in 1983 for film Hero, which was picturised on Waheed Murad and the song was a hit. He recorded a large number of duets in many languages with Noor Jahan, Zubaida Khanum, Runa Laila, Mala, Naheed Niazi, Irene Parveen, Naseem Begum, Mehnaz, Rubina Badar and Naheed Akhtar in his thirty-three-year singing career. Honorific title of Magician of voice Rushdi with Badar Munir, Sohail Rana and a film producer during a song composition Ahmed Rushdi is credited with the honorific nickname of \\"Magician of voice\\" because of his ability of singing in different genres including happy, comedy, tragedy, qawwali, lullaby, patriotic, pop, revolutionary and folk. He was not only the first south asian vocalist to go pop but also inspired generations with his clear delivery, timely expressions and rendition of songs. He had the unique quality of giving expressions during singing along with producing sounds of different birds and objects. He recorded a song \\"Burhapey mein dill na lagana\\" in the film Jub Jub Phool Khile for actors Waheed Murad and Nadeem in both young and old voices in a single go which attracted huge admiration from music critics.  First regular pop singer of South Asia  Ahmed Rushdi is considered to be the first regular pop singer of south asia as he introduced hip-hop, rock n roll, disco and other modern genres in South Asian music and has since then been adopted in Bangladesh, India and lately Nepal as a pioneering influence in their respective pop cultures. Following Rushdi's success, Christian bands specialising in jazz started performing at various night clubs and hotel lobbies in Karachi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Dhaka and Lahore. They would usually sing either famous American jazz hits or cover Rushdi's songs. Rushdi sang playback hits along with Runa Laila until the Bangladesh Liberation War when East Pakistan was declared an independent state. Because of Ahmed Rushdi, Pakistani music industry has steadily spread throughout South Asia and today is the most popular genre in Pakistan and the neighbouring South Asian countries. Pop icons like Alamgir and Muhammad Ali Shehki later on followed Rushdi's landmarks in playback singing. Personal life =Marriage= Ahmed Rushdi married Humera on 30 November 1963. His wife died in 1992, nine years after Rushdi. He belonged to a Sayed family (a sacred caste in muslims) and was a religious person. Despite his popularity and fame, Rushdi never had any scandal in his entire career. He had three daughters. His younger daughter, Rana Rushdi used to sing her father's songs in his presence which always pleased Rushdi a lot. He was against allowing his daughters to adopt singing as a profession. Ahmed Rushdi and Noor Jahan were the highest-paid singers in their time but Rushdi did not charge those producers and music directors a single rupee, who could not afford him. Famous music director Lal Mohammad Iqbal made his entry into the Pakistan film industry because Rushdi introduced him to different producers which he disclosed after Rushdi's death. Likewise, the poet Masroor Anwer got his first film as Rushdi insisted the music director Manzoor-Ashraf to give Masroor a chance. =Last years= In early 1980s, Rushdi shifted to Karachi as he was not feeling well and wanted to have a proper heart treatment. He was also singing less for films and film music itself was facing a decline. The 1980s saw a nose-dive in the progress of cinema in Pakistan. Number of cinemas decreased rapidly and people preferred watching television over going to a cinema. Playback singing that once was popular now struggled to exist and the singers needed a new medium to start afresh. Even then, Rushdi's demand and popularity was still there with the music directors. He opened a music academy in order to teach music and playback singing to youngsters. Ahmed Rushdi never faced downfall as far as his singing career is concerned. Until the 1970s, Rushdi was one of the leading voices in the subcontinent. He recorded fewer songs in his last years on the advice of doctors. Death Ahmed Rushdi's grave at Sakhi Hassan Graveyard, Karachi Since 1976, Ahmed Rushdi was a heart patient and his doctors advised him to abstain from singing but Rushdi refused by saying that music was his life. When he had a second heart attack in 1981, he was composing a musical album in the voice of singer Mujeeb Aalam. On the night of 11 April 1983,Death Anniversary.http://careers.samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=30587&CID;=1 he had a third heart attack. He was immediately taken to the hospital but pronounced dead by the doctors. He was 48. Rushdi was buried at Sakhi Hassan Graveyard, Karachi. His last non film song was \\"Aaney walo suno\\" which was a duet with Mehnaz. On his death, actor Waheed Murad said. \\"Today I have lost my voice.\\" He further said in an interview, \\"Sometimes I think that if I suddenly disappear or am no more for any reason, I would like to be remembered by the song ‘Bhooli hui hoon dastaan, guzra hua khayal hoon-Jisko na tum samajh sakay mien aisa aik sawal hoon’.\\" (I’m a tale forgotten, a thought bygone. I’m the question which you couldn’t understand) which was also picturised on him in 1967 and sung by Ahmed Rushdi. After Rushdi's death, Waheed Murad as well as other friends and singers had appeared on a show to pay him a tribute; many of those same people appeared on the show six months later, reminiscing about Waheed as he also died. Popularity and influence Ahmed Rushdi has changed the sound of film music in subcontinent and his impact has also been felt to the Indian and Bangladeshi film industries. He is widely regarded as one of the remarkable singers from south asia and was effective in every genre of singing including ghazals and qawwalis.Pop Music.http://www.pakium.com/2010/08/19/the-history-of-pakistani-pop-music Once music director Nisar Bazmi in an interview said, \\"Ahmed Rushdi and Mohammad Rafi are amongst those few singers in the subcontinent, whose voices did not form ‘cones’, as they rose and touch the higher notes. Their volumes rose up without getting squeaky!\\"Ahmed Rushdi. Cineplot.com. Retrieved on 2016-11-19. Bazmi also quoted the song \\"Aisey bhi hain meharban\\" (film Jaisey jantey nahin) to prove that Rushdi was also a master of serious singing. In another interview he said, \\"I was happy and amazed to find a Chinese group rendering this song on one occasion. People from abroad also sing Rushdi's songs which clearily indicates his popularity and influence.\\" Indian playback singer Kishore Kumar, being an admirer of Ahmed Rushdi, paid him a tribute at Royal Albert Hall London by singing Rushdi's one of the songs \\"Aik urran khattola aye ga kisi lal pari ko laye ga\\". Sonu Nigaam, Shan and Kumar Sanu, who remained leading playback singers in Indian film industry also paid their tributes to Rushdi and sang his songs. Actor Nadeem in a Television interview said, \\"Ahmed Rushdi had an amazing voice quality and he made my work easier.\\" Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained singers, although Rushdi never had any influences from any classical singer. He is famously known as Magician of voice and his popularity also turned traditional classical singers against him but did not affect his fame and his death is termed as irreparable loss to the industry. Actor Waheed Murad declared Rushdi's song, \\"Bhooli hui hoon daastan\\", his favorite song.Waheed Murad. Cineplot.com (2010-08-31). Retrieved on 2016-11-19. Music directors like M. Ashraf and Nisar Bazmi also hold centaury partnerships with Ahmed Rushdi and they have composed hundreds of songs for him. According to complete songography, M. Ashraf composed 734 songs in 211 films for Rushdi but available figures indicate a composition of 132 songs in 100 films for him. The first film of this pair was Speran in 1961 and the last was Hero in 1983. In 2018, Ahmed Rushdi's impact forced Coke Studio Pakistan (season 11) to produce a remake of Rushdi's first South Asian pop song \\"Ko Ko Korina\\" in the voices of Momina Mustehsan and Ahad Raza Mir which raised nationwide hue and cry to the extent that Minister for Human Rights in Pakistan Shireen Mazari had to come out in media to term the remake as \\"horrendous\\" since the classic was widely believed to be destroyed by both singers. Ahmed Rushdi influenced many singers in music industry including A Nayyar, Mujeeb Aalam, Naheed Niazi, Runa Laila and Bashir Ahmad (singer). He is included in those artists around the world who continue to be popular and enjoy a huge fan base even after their death.

He was a nephew of South Vietnam's first president, Ngô Đình Diệm, and of Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục.André Nguyen Van Chau The Miracle of HopeAndré Nguyen Van Chau The Road of Hope: A Gospel from Prison(French edition: Une vie d'espérance) 2007Michael D. O'Brien, Road of Hope: The Spiritual Journey of Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan Ignatius Press 2010 Pope Francis named him as Venerable on 4 May 2017, a significant step on the road towards canonization. Early life Thuận was born in Huế in 1928, the son of Nguyễn Văn Ấm and Elizabeth Ngô Đình Thị Hiệp, daughter of Ngô Đình Khả. He joined the seminary at An Ninh as a teenager, and was ordained a priest on 11 June 1953, by Monsignor Jean- Baptiste Urrutia. After six years of further studies in Rome, he was appointed in 1959–1967 as a faculty member and rector of the Seminary of Hoan Thiện, Huế. Episcopal career He was appointed Bishop of Nha Trang on 13 April 1967 and received episcopal consecration on 4 June 1967 at Huế from Angelo Palmas, Apostolic Delegate to Viêt Nam (and later Nuncio to Colombia and to Canada), assisted by Bishops Philippe Nguyễn Kim Dien, Apostolic Administrator, sede plena, of Huế, and Jean-Baptiste Urrutia, titular archbishop of Carpato. On 24 April 1975, he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Saigon. Six days later, Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese Army, and Thuận, targeted for his faith as well as his family connections to Ngô Đình Diệm, was detained by the communist government of Vietnam in a re-education camp for 13 years, nine in solitary confinement. In prison, he smuggled out messages to his people on scraps of paper. The brief reflections, copied by hand and circulated within the Vietnamese community, have been printed in the book, The Road of Hope. Through a network of influential Overseas Vietnamese, including dignitaries, like his former classmate Monsignor Trần Văn Hoài, The Road of Hope was distributed worldwide. Another book, Prayers of Hope, contains his prayers written in prison. The bishop fashioned a tiny Bible out of scraps of paper. Sympathetic guards smuggled in a piece of wood and some wire from which he crafted a small crucifix. =In exile= On 21 November 1988, Thuận was released by the communist government but kept under house arrest in the archbishop's house in Hanoi, impeded from returning to his see, Hồ Chí Minh City. He was allowed to visit Rome in 1991 but not to return. The following year, he was given a post at the International Catholic Commission for Migration in Geneva, Switzerland. On 24 November 1994, he was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, and at the same time resigned from his post of Coadjutor Archbishop of Sai Gon. As President of the Pontifical Council, he handled issues such as Third World debt. In 1995, he was appointed Postulator of the Cause of Beatification of Brother Nguyễn Tan Văn, also known as Marcel Van. On 21 February 2001, Thuận was created a Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria della Scala. He died of cancer in a clinic in Rome, Italy, on 16 September 2002, at the age of 74. Legacy On 16 September 2007, the fifth anniversary of the cardinal's death, the Roman Catholic Church began the beatification process for Thuận. Pope Benedict XVI expressed \\"profound joy\\" at news of the official opening of the beatification cause. Roman Catholics in Vietnam also positively received the news on beatification process opening for the cardinal. In the words of a catechist from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hồ Chí Minh City, \\"Nguyễn Văn Thuận is an example of holiness for Vietnamese Catholics and for the entire world.\\" In his 2007 encyclical, Spe Salvi, Benedict XVI referred to Thuận's Prayers of Hope, saying: > During thirteen years in jail, in a situation of seemingly utter > hopelessness, the fact that he could listen and speak to God became for him > an increasing power of hope, which enabled him, after his release, to become > for people all over the world a witness to hope—to that great hope which > does not wane even in the nights of solitude. Dr. Waldery Hilgeman is Postulator of the Cause for Thuận's canonization. Writings * François-Xavier Nguyễn Văn Thuận. Five Loaves & Two Fish 1969 * François-Xavier Nguyễn Văn Thuận.

Arabic, Hebrew, Pashto, Persian, Urdu, and Sindhi are the most widespread RTL writing systems in modern times. Right-to-left can also refer to ' (TB-RL or TBRL) scripts such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, though in modern times they are also commonly written .

Uses  Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu are the most widespread RTL writing systems in modern times. As usage of the Arabic script spread, the repertoire of 28 characters used to write the Arabic language was supplemented to accommodate the sounds of many other languages such as Persian, Pashto, etc. While the Hebrew alphabet is used to write the Hebrew language, it is also used to write other Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Judaeo-Spanish. Syriac and Mandaean (Mandaic) scripts are derived from Aramaic and are written RTL. Samaritan is similar, but developed from Proto-Hebrew rather than Aramaic. Many other ancient and historic scripts derived from Aramaic inherited its right-to-left direction. Several languages have both Arabic RTL and non-Arabic LTR writing systems. For example, Sindhi is commonly written in Arabic and Devanagari scripts, and a number of others have been used. Kurdish may be written in Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic or Armenian script. Thaana appeared around 1600 CE. Most modern scripts are LTR, but N'Ko (1949), Mende Kikakui (19th century), Adlam (1980s) and Hanifi Rohingya (1980s) were created in modern times and are RTL. Ancient examples of text using alphabets such as Phoenician, Greek, or Old Italic may exist variously in left-to-right, right-to-left, or boustrophedon order; so it is not always possible to classify some ancient writing systems as purely RTL or LTR.

It also features stellar performances by Natasha Klauss , Kristina Lilley and Javier Gómez.“La mujer en el espejo”: fotos del antes y ahora de los actores de la telenovela Plot Juliana Soler is a simple, tender, and extremely intelligent young woman. Her mother, Regina Soler, was a renowned model who is obsessed with physical beauty and has always led her daughter to believe that she is ugly, so Juliana does not give importance to her physical appearance. Despite her teasing, Juliana loves her mother above all else. Mercedes, Juliana's aunt, has always loved and supported her as she is and has comforted her before the insults and criticism of her mother. Juliana has learned to prepare with her all kinds of concoctions and potions with herbs. Mercedes keeps a great secret: a magic mirror prepared by herself especially for Juliana's future. After the death of her aunt, Juliana decides (without knowing that the mirror had hidden magic) to keep and take care of her aunt's mirror, always keeping it covered, since her aunt always said to her: nobody could be seen in it. Thanks to the magic mirror, Juliana becomes the beautiful Maritza Ferrer, a chemical engineer capable of achieving everything she sets out to do with a smile. However, that dream will only last during the day, because at nightfall Juliana will be the same as ever. As Maritza, Juliana meets Marcos Mutti, Gabriel Mutti's adoptive son, owner of the largest cosmetic brand in the country. The young man becomes the great love of Maritza and Juliana's confidant without knowing that it is the same woman. Juliana, like Maritza, becomes pregnant with Marcos' child and they decide to get married, but Bárbara (Gabriel's wife) together with Alberto and Romero (their accomplices) devises a plan to blame Maritza for all the frauds they have committed in the company and send her to jail. On the day after Maritza and Marcos' marriage, police officers appeared looking for Maritza with an arrest warrant. The dance teacher, Paco Tapia, (Juliana's godfather and connoisseur of the secret of the mirror), advises her to flee; but the police start a chase. On the way, they meet a thief who, after having robbed a gas station, takes them hostage to escape without realizing that the police were already chasing them. She shoots Master Tapia and leaves her on the road, leaving only Maritza. Maritza manages to save herself by falling outside while he was rolling. A herbalist finds her and tries to steal some boots that she wore when she believed she was dead, but discovers that she is still alive and decides to heal her so that Maritza's family would reward her for saving her (not knowing that she was actually a fugitive from the law). Maritza (Juliana) loses the child in her womb due to the accident. When it gets dark, she turns into Juliana and the herbalist is scared and abandons her, believing she was the devil. Juan Tobías Fonseca finds Juliana and takes her to a clinic in a nearby town where he finds out that she was pregnant and that she has lost the child she was expecting. (He also learns the secret, because he sees how Juliana becomes Maritza at daylight). On the other hand, Juliana does not know that she is the only biological daughter of Gabriel Mutti, because years ago, Gabriel and Regina had a beautiful adventure of which Juliana was the fruit. However, Regina, at first out of pride and then, also ashamed of the appearance of her daughter, never told Gabriel, because she does not want the great love of her life to discover that they have such an ugly daughter. Throughout the beautiful love story between Marcos and Maritza, great trials, fears, insecurities, rivals, greed, and silence will be interposed. Desperate Barbara realizes that Juan Tobías had told Maritza what happened between them and for fear and revenge he sends Pedro Barajas to kill Maritza. After Pedro failed, he was chased by the neighborhood and after the beating they gave him, his cell phone fell out. Meanwhile, Barbara desperate to know if Pedro had killed Maritza calls him on the cell phone. Marcos hears it since Pedro had dropped it and takes it and Bárbara answers him so Marcos discovers that she had ordered Maritza killed. Barbara has a discussion with Marcos, Antonia, and Gabriel; and decides to leave the house. The next day, Barbara goes to the academy to kill Maritza and when she arrives at Aunt Mercedes' laboratory, she hides in the closet. After crying, Maritza who was with Luzmila becomes Juliana. Barbara had discovered the secret. After what happened, Barbara goes crazy and goes into Regina's house and with threats asks her to explain what she saw. As Regina did not know the secret, Barbara mistreated and beat her. Paco goes to Regina's house with Don Néstor (Juan Tobías' father) they open the door and discover Barbara who finally manages to escape and after arriving at Alberto's house she meets Gabriel; who had just come from talking to Lieutenant Andrade, who was already aware of Barbara's past and because of this they have a strong discussion. The next day Maritza has to go to read Juan Tobías's will when he arrives at the office of Mr. Casillas (who had been assassinated by Bárbara). Barbara appears with a can of gasoline and after having tied Maritza burns the office. The murderer with the black gloves (Cristina) locks the door and Barbara, unable to leave, becomes nervous, slips and burns completely. After a time in the hospital, Bárbara escapes with the help of Romero to the old cellar of the Empresas Mutti, where she sees herself in a mirror: her face was totally disfigured and her hair had been burned. She had physically become what she was inside: a monster. Seeing her completely disfigured face, Barbara breaks the mirror and takes a glass to cut the veins on her wrists and commit suicide, because she prefers to die than to live like this, but she remembers the mirror and decides to steal it and becomes Maritza Ferrer to recover the Mutti companies and obtain Juan Tobías' inheritance. Juliana decides, after many things have happened, to tell Marcos the secret of the mirror. Now, Marcos will have to decide what to do since, on the one hand, lies deceit and lies, something that he cannot bear or forgive, but on the other hand, there is the only woman who has made him truly love and discover that her true beauty of love is found only inside. Later, Marcos and company find out who Maritza truly was, and that he truly fell in love with Juliana. He then asks her to marry him. 6 months Juliana and Marcos are preparing for their wedding and Barbara decides to return after undergoing 4 surgeries abroad to stop being Maritza Ferrer. Before returning, he calls Romero and sends him to kill Juliana, but he fails and shoots Marcos. After the shot, Marcos is sterile and cannot have children, so he decides to break up with Juliana so that she can have what she wants most. Juan Tobías returns and decides to speak to Juliana, who believes that it was he who made Marcos change his mind. Barbara goes to the hospital and with Vanessa's identity, she cheats Luzmila and Juliana and they take her to the neighborhood without knowing who she really is. Finally, Barbara steals some papers from Marbella and decides to flee, at that moment the murderer with the black gloves (Cristina), who had gone to kill Juliana, appears in Juliana's apartment, Barbara discovers that it was Cristina and after a fight leaves her on the ground dying. Finally, Barbara is killed by Romero, (who later commits suicide) at Juliana and Marcos' wedding party. 3 years later, they are the parents of a boy and a girl (Juliana was pregnant before the shooting and did not know it) and they live happily.

This game is nearly identical to the Pitch variant Pedro. It also has features reminiscent of Euchre. Gameplay Setup Sixty- three is played by four players, in two teams, and uses a full deck of cards plus one joker. The players on the same team should sit opposite each other, and any 'table talk' or transfer of information about the games between partners is strictly forbidden. Dealing The dealer will customarily offer to let the person to their right cut the deck prior to a hand. The players are dealt 9 cards each (given out to each player three cards at a time), after which a bid round ensues to determine which suit will be trump. Bidding Each player bids based on the number of points he/she feels that their team can take, with the minimum bid being 40 and the maximum bid being 63 (hence the name of the game). The player willing to bid the highest will 'take the hand' and be able to decide which suit will be trump. It is not unusual for partners to bid against each other if they both have a good hand. Bidding should be done aggressively to try to ensure that trump is picked by either yourself or your teammate, however, should a team fail to 'make their bid', i.e. they fail to take as many points as they bid, then their score will drop by the amount of their bid. A king, the card worth the most points (see below), is generally required in a hand before it is considered biddable. If no bids are placed prior to the dealer then the bid is taken by the dealer for the default bid of 25. Re-dealing After the bidding, players discard all non-trump cards in their hands, and the dealer deals more cards from the remainder of the deck until each player has six in their hand, with all cards remaining going to the dealer to pick through so all trump are in play. Should a player have more than six trump in their hand, then they may give the excess trump to their partner, provided it is a card not worth any points (see below) and that the transfer is carried out face-up so the other team may see. Any cards now in the hand which are not trump are referred to as dirt. Gameplay The person who won the bid then plays the lead card in the first hand (he must lead trump in the first hand), and the players then attempt to take as many points for their team as possible in the ensuing rounds. A round consists of each player playing one card, with the winner of the round playing the lead card in the next round. If trump is lead, all players must follow suit if they can. Should a dirt card be lead, then players may either play dirt as well (any suit), or trump should they choose to. Any trump card will take any dirt card. Should a player run out of trump, they may play all their remaining cards in one hand and be considered out of the hand. The hand is finished when all players have played all their cards. The game ends when one team reaches 250 points (usually five to ten hands will be required for this). Point values and killing power of cards in Sixty-three The cards are arranged in descending order for killing power, with point values listed by the side of each card. The 'opposite 5' means the 5 which is the same colour as trump (e.g. the 5 of clubs is opposite the 5 of spades). The 2 (including its one point) is always kept by the person who plays it, regardless of who wins the hand. These point values apply only for cards of the trump suit as decided in the bidding round - all 'dirt' suits are worthless. *Ace - 1 point *King - 25 points *Queen *Jack - 1 point *10 - 1 point *9 - 9 points *8 *7 *6 *5, opposite 5 - 5 points *4 *3 *2 - 1 point *Joker - 15 points Note: In Inverness County, Cape Breton Island, the 3 of trump is worth 15 and the Joker is not used. Note: In Queens County, New Brunswick, the 2 of trump is worth 2, and the 10 is worth 0 points, the game is also played to 225.

Belgium The Belgians were early adopters of battlefield UAVs, introducing the \\"Epervier (Sparrowhawk)\\" UAV in the early 1970s. It was built by Manufacture Belge De Lampes Et De Materiel Electronique SA (MBLE) of Belgium. Epervier prototypes were propeller-driven, but the production Epervier UAV, the \\"X.5\\" model, was fitted with a Rover TJ125 turbojet with 510 N (52 kgf / 114 lbf) thrust. It was launched by a RATO booster and recovered by parachute. It had a boxy fiberglass fuselage with a rear-mounted truncated-delta wing, a single tailfin, and winglet fins at the end of each wing. It had a length of 2.25 meters (7 feet 4 inches), a wingspan of 1/72 meters (5 feet 8 inches), and a launch weight of 142 kilograms (313 pounds), The Epervier has now been replaced by the IAI Hunter, which was obtained by the Belgian military with Belgian-specified systems. Croatia Croatia has fielded a series of tactical UAVs, beginning with the MAH-1 in early 1993 built by Igor Pongrac. Later on Israels IAI Malat tactical UAVs were built and developed on behalf MAH-1. France Matra BAe Dynamics developed a UAV named \\"Dragon\\". The Dragon was roughly the same size as and similar to the SAGEM Crecerelle, with the same pusher-prop delta configuration, except that instead of having a single tailfin mounted on the fuselage, the Dragon had a tailfin on each wingtip. It was intended as a jamming platform. It seems to have dropped out of sight, possibly because the French Army acquired the Crecerelle for the jamming mission. Georgia Georgia's defence research center developed a series of small for infantry purpose unmanned areal vehicles, including multiple fixed-rotor variants. After a financial dispute with Israel over the delivery of UAV systems, the center in cooperation with TAM started to develop new medium-sized drones which would compensate the need of modern systems equipped with latest technology. Even though these projects are still in development stage, one variant was exposed in April, 2012. Pakistan Pakistan developed a number of battlefield UAVs. Pakistan's \\"Air Weapons Complex (AWC)\\" has completed development of their \\"Bravo\\" battlefield surveillance UAV, and is now in service with law enforcement and border security organizations. The Bravo is apparently a fairly conventional piston- powered small battlefield UAV, has a composite airframe, a maximum payload of 20 kilograms (44 pounds), and a radius of action of up to . It is guided by a preprogrammed navigation system. The AWC \\"Vision-1\\" is an improved version of the Bravo, and AWC also makes a high-altitude reconnaissance drone, the \\"Vector\\", as well as two target drones, the \\"Nishan\\" and the \\"Hornet\\". Russia Yakovlev is currently working on two new tactical UAVs: * The \\"Albatros\\" is a tiltrotor design along the lines of the Bell Eagle Eye, except that it has an inverted-vee tail. It will have a 120 kW (160 hp) engine, seven-hour endurance. The range is limited to by the command-data radio link. It is primarily focused on shipboard applications. * Details of the \\"Expert\\" are unclear, but it appears to be a small battlefield surveillance UAV, of the sort usually launched by a bungee catapult. United States International battlefield UAVs =EADS Orka, Scorpio, Surveyor= * The European Aerospace & Defense Systems (EADS) company is currently promoting a number of UAVs. One, the \\"Orka\\", is a UAV helicopter with an airframe length of 6.2 meters (20,3 feet) and a weight of about 700 kilograms (1543 pounds) for use by the army and on naval vessels. It is currently favoured as the likely replacement for the larger and heavier SEAMOS helicopter UAV that was abandoned by the Germans. The Orka is derived from a light helicopter the Cabri built by Hélicoptères Guimbal of France. It has a conventional helicopter configuration, with a three-bladed main rotor with a diameter of 7.2 meters (23.6 feet), an enclosed \\"fenestron\\" tail rotor favoured by the French, and landing skips. There is a sensor turret under the nose and an antenna or sensor drum under the belly between the landing skids. The production Orka is expected to have an endurance of 8 hours and a payload of 150 kilograms (331 pounds). * The EADS \\"Scorpio\\" is a much smaller battlefield helicopter, focused on special operations. It is also of conventional helicopter configuration, with a two-blade main rotor with Hiller-type stabilization paddles, an exposed two-blade tail rotor, and landing skids. A sensor turret may be fitted between the landing skids. There are several variants in the Scorpio line: * The 13 kilogram (29 pound) \\"Scorpio-6\\" flies at 35 km/h (22 mph) and has an endurance of an hour. * The 40 kilogram (88 pound) \\"Scorpio-30\\" flies at 50 km/h (31 mph) and has an endurance of two hours. * The EADS \\"Surveyor\\" is still in preliminary investigation phase.

The director was Fred C. Brannon, with a screenplay by Ronald Davidson, and special effects by the Lydecker brothers. This serial recycles the flying sequences from Republic's earlier 1949 serial King of the Rocket Men. It was later released by Republic in 1966 as the 100-minute television film Retik the Moon Menace. The odd naming choice of the serial's main hero, \\"Commando Cody,\\" was possibly an attempt by Republic to make young audiences think they were seeing another adventure of Commander Corry, the hero of the popular ABC TV and radio series Space Patrol (1950–1955). However, there is no surviving evidence that this was a consideration by anyone at Republic. Plot Commando Cody with lunar tank Commando Cody (George Wallace) is a civilian researcher and inventor with a number of employees. He uses a streamlined helmet and a sonic-powered rocket backpack attached to a leather flying jacket. Cody also uses a rocket ship capable of reaching the Moon. When the U. S. finds itself under attack from a mysterious force that can wipe out entire military bases and industrial complexes, Cody surmises (correctly) that the Earth is coming under attack from our own Moon. He then flies his rocket ship there and confronts the Moon's dictator, Retik (Roy Barcroft), who boldly announces his plans to both conquer Earth and then move the Moon's entire population here using spaceships. During the next 11 serial chapters, Cody, now back on Earth, and his associates Joan (Aline Towne), Ted (William Bakewell) and Dick (Gayle Kellogg) battle an elusive lunar agent named Krog (Peter Brocco) and his gang of human henchmen led by Graber (Clayton Moore) and Daly (Bob Stevenson), who use Lunarium-powered ray cannons to disrupt defense forces and weaken public morale. After a second trip to the Moon, in which he captures a sample ray cannon for duplication in his lab, Cody tracks Retik's minions to their hideout where Krog is killed by one of his own devices, and Graber and Daly subsequently die in an over-the-cliff car chase. Retik flies to Earth to take personal charge of his collapsing operations but is blasted out of the sky by one of his own ray weapons.

Cast Radar Men From the Moon - Chapter 1: Moon Rocket * George Wallace as Commando Cody. * Aline Towne as Joan Gilbert * Roy Barcroft as Retik, Ruler of the Moon. * William Bakewell as Ted Richards * Peter Brocco as Krog * Clayton Moore as Graber * Bob Stevenson as Daly * Don Walters as Govt. Agent Henderson Production Radar Men from the Moon was budgeted at $172,840, although the final negative cost was $185,702 (a $12,862, or 7.4%, overspend). It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1952 and was filmed between October 17 and November 6, 1951 under the working title Planet Men from Mars; the serial's production number was 1932. The serial's budget was so tight that a stunt double was not always used for lead actor George Wallace. His nose was broken by accident while filming an energetic fight scene with actor Clayton Moore. For the camera's close-up flying sequences, Wallace was suspended in mid-air above a sound stage; he was lying on a horizontal board with the rocket suit's jacket closed around it, with a rear projection screen behind him. Wallace performed his own stunt flying take-offs by jumping onto a springboard that would send him up and over the camera rig set-up. This serial is heavily padded with rocket-suit effects footage first filmed for the earlier King of the Rocket Men, to which some believe this was a pseudo- sequel. A repainted Juggernaut vehicle from Republic's much-earlier Undersea Kingdom serial is also reused here as Retik's lunar tank.Harmon and Glut 1973, pp. 288–290. All spaceship footage was filmed new for Radar Men from the Moon. Outer space is shown as brightly lit, and the characters are shown walking on the Moon, in normal Earth gravity and in daylight, without pressure suits. The laboratory building is actually a Republic Pictures office building with a prop \\"Cody Laboratories\\" sign added to its exterior. Two different aerodynamic helmets were used with the Commando Cody rocket backpack, with the lighter weight version being used only in the stunt sequences; the single-hinged visors of both helmets were always getting stuck open or closed. Release =Theatrical= Radar Men from the Moon's official release date is January 9, 1952, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to U. S. film exchanges. Republic's next new serial, Zombies of the Stratosphere, which also used some of the Cody flying suit and spaceship footage seen here, followed in the summer and began as a sequel to \\"Radar Men\\": for unspecified reasons, Republic changed the character names of Cody and Joan at the last minute. In between these two serials, Republic had begun filming on its first attempt at a TV series, \\"Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe\\", but stopped production of that after the first three episodes were filmed to begin work on \\"Zombies of the Stratosphere\\". After that serial was finished, Republic resumed filming 9 more episodes of the Commando Cody TV series, but then, after the series was completed, it was theatrically released for contractual reasons, finally going to TV two years later. Radar Men from the Moon was re-released on September 30, 1957 between Republic's re-releases of the similar Zorro's Black Whip and Son of Zorro. Previously, the final original Republic serial was King of the Carnival released two years earlier in 1955. =Television= Radar Men from the Moon was one of 26 Republic serials syndicated for television in 1966 as 100 minute TV feature films under their Century 66 package marketing name; the title given the TV-movie was Retik the Moon Menace. In 1979, Firesign Theatre used segments of this and other serials in their made-for-TV parody comedy movie, J-Men Forever.http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=jmen In 1989, the serial regained notoriety as the first shorts shown by the cult series Mystery Science Theater 3000. The first eight-and-a-half chapters of this Commando Cody serial were lampooned before their main feature-of-the-week (only half of the ninth installment was shown, with the in-show excuse being \\"the film broke\\").

From his earliest childhood he was very sickly; at the age of fifteen his sight and hearing were almost completely destroyed; and later in life he became totally blind. He developed the Lorm alphabet, a form of tactile signing named after him. When but sixteen years old he contributed a number of poems to various periodicals. In 1843 he completed his first important literary production, Abdul, the Mohammedan Faust legend, in five cantos (2nd ed. Berlin, 1852). His Wien's Poetische Schwingen und Federn (Vienna, 1847) manifested critical acumen, but also a tinge of political acerbity in its attack on the censor system of the Austrian chancellor Prince Metternich. His friends advised Landesmann to leave Vienna, and he went to Berlin, where he assumed the pseudonym Hieronymus Lorm in order to secure his family from possible trouble with the Viennese police. In Berlin he became a regular contributor to Kühne's Europa. After the revolution of 1848 he returned to Vienna, settling in Baden bei Wien in 1853.\\"Landesmann, Heinrich; Ps. Hieronymus Lorm (1821-1902), Schriftsteller und Journalist.\\" Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. 4, issue 20 (1969), p. 428-429. In 1856 he married; in 1873 he moved to Dresden; and in 1892 he settled in Brünn (Brno). A sister of Landesmann's was the second wife of Berthold Auerbach. Landesmann was distinctively a lyric poet. The peculiar vein of pessimism that runs through both his poetry and his prose writings has won for him the title of the \\"lyrical Schopenhauer\\".  Works  His more important works are: * Ein Zögling des Jahres 1848 his first novel (3 vols., Vienna, 1855; 3d ed., 1863, under the title Gabriel Solmar), in which he treats, among other subjects, of the struggle of the modern Jew against the prejudices of his fellow citizens. * Am Kamin (2 vols., Berlin, 1856) * Erzählungen des Heimgekehrten (Prague, 1858) * Intimes Leben (ib. 1860) * Novellen (2 vols., Vienna, 1864) * Gedichte (Hamburg, 1870; 7th ed., 1894) * Philosophisch-Kritische Streifzüge (Berlin, 1873) * Geflügelte Stunden.

Based in Downtown Toronto and governed by the University Health Network (UHN), Canada's largest funded health care organization, Michener began as the Toronto Institute of Medical Technology in 1958 with a pilot program in Medical Laboratory Technology at the Toronto General Hospital. After years of expansion through more programs offered, the institute was relocated to its present campus in 1972 and was renamed in 1990 \\"The Michener Institute\\" after Roland Michener, former Governor General of Canada. The institute is funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and offers certification in various medical technologies, including chiropody, respiratory therapy, medical imaging, radiation, and genetics. Some of its programs are joint programs offered in partnership with the University of Toronto and Laurentian University. History The Michener Institute from St. Patrick Street. The Michener Institute was founded by Dr. Diana Michener Schatz under the name the Toronto Institute of Medical Technology. In 1958 the value of combining learning in an educational environment with clinical education in a teaching hospital was demonstrated by pilot program developed by hospital-based physicians and medical technologists. In 1990 the name was changed to the Michener Institute in honour of Roland Michener, the 20th Canadian Governor General. In 2008, the Michener Institute celebrated 50 years in applied health science education. In 2016 Michener officially integrated with the University Health Network (UHN) to become the Michener Institute of Education at UHN, a partnership that embeds the school within the hospital network. The aim of the integration is to embed teaching in clinical practice and research, and to deliver more up- to-date and comprehensive education for students. It also aims to create better learning opportunities for working health care professionals and accelerate the transfer of academic research from the school labs into clinical practice. The integration was inspired by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and is the first time such a partnership between a school and a hospital has existed in Canada. Programs The Michener Institute has 12 full-time programs, two part-time programs and many more continuing education programs. Some of Michener's full-time programs include: Chiropody, Genetics Technology, Medical Laboratory Sciences, Nuclear Medicine and Respiratory Therapy. The part-time programs are Anesthesia Assistant and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The Michener Institute offers Bachelor's Degrees available through joint programs with the University of Toronto (Medical Radiation Sciences) and Laurentian University (Radiation Therapy).

Foundation An initial meeting to plan the Henry Bradshaw Society took place in London on 3 July 1890, after which provisional subscriptions were solicited. The general meeting to inaugurate the Society took place on 25 November 1890 in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey. A committee was finalised and a programme of publications worked out. One of the models for the society was the Durham-based Surtees Society, formed in 1834, which in turn received assistance from officers of the Bannatyne Club. The foundation of the new society was also linked, more by overlapping interests than organizational models, to the body then known as the St Paul's Ecclesiological Society. John Wickham Legg, who had played a significant role in the re- establishment of that society in 1879 after a decade or so of limbo, also became an important founding member of the Henry Bradshaw Society. The Society was named after Henry Bradshaw (1831–1886), Librarian of the Cambridge University Library, who had been interested in early printing and in bibliographic description. This latter passion led to his becoming familiar with many European libraries, where he also became aware of holdings of early English liturgical manuscripts. The promised subscribers including many Anglican bishops and other dignitaries, but also Léopold Delisle of the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, Antonio Maria Ceriani of the Ambrosian Library, Milan and others Catholics such as W.H. James Weale, Edmund Bishop, Dom Aidan Gasquet, the abbé Louis Duchesne, and Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, abbot of Maredsous. The first volumes were to be printed in 500 copies and at the next meeting the Council fixed the individual subscription rate as 12 guineas (£12 12s). Editions By the end of the 19th century some 19 volumes had been issued, three of which contained an edition of the Westminster Missal, given to the abbey by Abbot Nicholas Lytlington, abbot 1362-1386, and builder of the Jerusalem Chamber, where the Society was publicly launched. Other early editions were of the coronation rites of King Charles I (1892), the Martiloge in Englysshe (1893), the Antiphonary of Bangor (1893–6; from the Ambrosian Library), the Tracts of Clement Maydeston (1894), the Winchester Troper, the Martyrology of Gorman (1895; from the Royal Library, Brussels), the Missal of Robert of Jumièges (1896; from Rouen public library), the Irish Liber Hymnorum (1898; from Trinity College Library, Dublin), the Rosslyn Missal (1899; from the Advocates Library, Edinburgh), the Coronation Book of Charles V of France (1899; British Library, Cotton Tiberius MS B.VIII), the Missale Romanum, printed in Milan in 1474 (1899–1907) and the fifteenth-century Processional of the Nuns of Chester (1899). Although the Society fell into something of a slump after the Second World War, it was revived with some vigour in the 1980s. The latest volume to be published, in 2013, is numbered 120.

Francisco de Quiñones, O.F.M., (Latin: Franciscus Cardinal Quignonius) (also Francisco de los Ángeles) (ca. 1482 in Kingdom of León - November 5, 1540 in Veroli, Papal States) was a Spanish Franciscan friar and later cardinal who was responsible for some reforms in the Catholic Church in Spain. Biography He was the son of , Count of Luna, was educated as a page of Cardinal Ximenes, and at the age of sixteen entered the Order of Friars Minor in the friary of St. Mary of the Angels in Alcalá de Henares, taking the name of Francis of the Angels (1498). His tomb by Jacopo Sansovino Having completed his studies, he successively discharged all the various offices of his Order as Custos, Commissary General, and Vicar General of the Observant branch of the Order. In 1521 he had obtained special permission and faculties from Pope Leo X to go to the missions in the Americas, together with Friar Jean Glapion, confessor of Emperor Charles V. Glapion died in the same year, however, and Quiñones was elected Commissary General of the Ultramontane Franciscans—those north of the Alps (1521–23). At the General Chapter of the Order held in Burgos in 1523, he was elected Minister General of the Order (1523–27). As Minister General, he visited the friaries of Spain (1523–25), as well as a great part of Italy and the Spanish Netherlands (1525–27). He promoted studies, maintained general discipline, and was not less active in behalf of missions. In 1524 he sent twelve missionaries to Mexico, among them Friar Juan Juárez, who later became the first bishop within the present territory of the United States. After the sack of Rome in 1527 and the imprisonment of Pope Clement VII (May, 1527), Quiñones, who was distantly related to the Emperor, and was also his confidant, seemed the man best able to effect the release of the pope, and a full reconciliation between him and the emperor. He was thrice sent to the emperor for this purpose, and his efforts were crowned with success by the deliverance of Pope Clement (December, 1527), and the Treaty of Barcelona (1528) and Cambrai (1529). As these embassies rendered his effective government of the Order impossible, Quiñones renounced the generalship in December 1527, and in September of the following year he was created cardinal of the title of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, hence his name \\"Cardinal of the Holy Cross\\". From 1530 to 1533 he was also Bishop of Coria, in Spain, and for a short time, in 1539, administrator of Acerno (Naples), but he was never Cardinal Bishop at Palestrina, as some authors assert. As a cardinal, Quiñones always occupied a distinguished position in the Sacred College and closely followed the movement of the Reformation in Germany. When Pope Paul III contemplated assembling a general Council at Mantua, he sent (1536) the Cardinal of the Holy Cross to Emperor Ferdinand I, King of the Romans and of Hungary, to promote that cause. The cardinal, however, died in 1540 and did not live to see the opening of the Council of Trent in 1545. His body was brought from Veroli to Rome and buried in his titular church, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, in a tomb which he had prepared himself. Quiñones left some legislative compilations for his Order, but is best known for his reform of the Roman Breviary undertaken by the order of Pope Clement.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. James bowled a five-wicket maiden as a school boy at Farleigh School and was in the 1st XI at Eton for several years before representing Durham UCCE and playing minor county cricket for Cumberland. His exceptional control and cricket brain attracted Hampshire to sign him in 2002. Since joining Bruce spent successive winters in Australia with the Balmain Tigers in Sydney 2002-2003 and with South Perth C.C. from 2003-2005. Having had limited opportunities thus far to shine, he played in four first-class matches in the year 2005. He was in the Hampshire squad which won the C&G; Trophy, and which finished runners-up in Division One of the Frizell County Championship. Enthused with the new responsibility of taking the new ball for Hampshire in 2006, Bruce performed brilliantly in the early stages of the season, taking a career best 5-43 against champions Nottinghamshire at the Rose Bowl in June 2006. He impressed further with a destructive opening spell of 7-2-14-3 against the touring West Indies 'A' side in August 2006. Hampshire awarded him his county cap at the end of the 2006 season and he was also mentioned as Cricinfo's 'Rising Star' for his county. Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton, both former England captains, recently stated on Sky Sports that if England were to pick a Hampshire bowler for the England Academy tour to Bangladesh it should have been James Bruce and not Chris Tremlett, further evidence of his rising stock. James has let it be known that his worst experience on the cricket field was having his box split clean in half whilst facing Australian fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz. James announced his retirement from the game on 9 February 2008, to pursue a job in the city of London.

In the USAF plan, the Gnat 750 was known as \\"Tier 1\\", while the Predator was known as \\"Tier 2\\". The original expectation was that the series would then move on to a very large and powerful long-range UAV known as \\"Tier 3\\", something along the lines of a B-2 Stealth bomber, but Tier 3 proved overambitious and was cancelled. In place of Tier 3, the USAF decided to develop a smaller \\"Tier 3-\\" UAV designated the \\"Darkstar\\", and a \\"Tier 2+\\" UAV, something like a \\"super Predator\\", the Teledyne-Ryan \\"Global Hawk\\". The Lockheed Martin / Boeing Tier 3- Darkstar was a stealthy design that resembled a big pumpkin seed with a long straight wing at the rear. It was to send real- time still images produced by either SAR or EO sensors, though it didn't have the capacity to carry both sensors at the same time. Data was to be returned using a satellite communications link with a bandwidth of 1.5 megabits per second. The Darkstar was intended to penetrate protected airspace to observe high-value targets for a limited amount of time. Range and endurance were intended to be similar to that of the Predator, though the Darkstar's sensor suite could cover over twice the area, and of course it was harder to detect. The Darkstar was powered by a Williams Research FJ-44-1A turbofan engine with 8.46 kN (862 kgf / 1,900 lbf) thrust, and could carry a 450 kilogram (1,000 pound) payload. The UAV was to cost about US$10 million each. The Darkstar was unlucky. On its second takeoff in the spring of 1996, it stood up on one wing and slammed into the runway, bursting into fire and smoke. An analysis of the failure showed flight software and takeoff procedures to be faulty. The Air Force and the contractors didn't give up right away, and a redesigned Darkstar, now formally designated \\"RQ-3A\\", flew in the early summer of 1998. However, the program was still unhealthy, and the Darkstar was cancelled in early 1999. Although flight tests were generally satisfactory, the Darkstar was by no means close to being a useful operational system. Building an actual operational UAV based on the Darkstar would have required major redesign and improvement, and the costs were more than the Air Force was willing to spend. * At least that was what the official line was. In the summer of 2003, confirming rumors that had been in circulation for some time, Air Force officials announced that Lockheed Martin's \\"Skunk Works\\" had developed several prototypes of a stealthy reconnaissance UAV similar to the DarkStar but larger, and that this machine had been used in an operational evaluation over Iraq during the American invasion of that country in the spring of 2003. The unnamed UAV's payload was described as less than that of a Lockheed U-2, featuring a \\"low probability of intercept (LPI)\\" SAR and electro-optic sensors, along with a satcom datalink. Range was less than that of the Global Hawk, described below, though cost is described as several times greater. The Air Force wanted to conduct the operational evaluation to see if putting the new machine into production was worthwhile. The most likely operational base for the UAV was Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which has extensive and well- developed facilities, is near to Iraq, and was off-limits to reporters during the invasion of Iraq. Sources have also leaked information about a roughly comparable Boeing effort to develop a stealth UAV test bed. This particular machine is said to have been flown in a wide range of configurations, with different tails, noses, and wings, to validate stealth concepts. This UAV was declassified in 2006 as the Lockheed Martin Polecat. Northrop Grumman RQ-4A Global Hawk/sensor craft With the death of the Darkstar, the Ryan RQ-4A Global Hawk became the Air Force's great hope for a strategic UAV reconnaissance platform. With the purchase of Ryan by Northrop Grumman in July 1999, the aircraft became the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk. The Global Hawk is not particularly stealthy, but it has sophisticated long-range sensors to allow it to operate outside of hostile air defenses, and can survey as much as of terrain a day. In comparison to the Predator, if a Global Hawk were flown out of San Francisco, it would be able to operate in Maine for 24 hours, observe a 370 x 370 kilometer (230 x 230 mile) grid, and then fly back home. The Global Hawk costs about US$10 million each in full production, is powered by an Allison Rolls-Royce AE3007H turbofan engine with 31.4 (3,200 kgf / 7,050 lbf) thrust, and carries a payload of 900 kilograms (2,000 pounds). The fuselage is mostly of conventional aluminum airframe construction, while the wings are made of carbon composite. The Global Hawk carries the \\"Hughes Integrated Surveillance & Reconnaissance (HISAR)\\" sensor system. HISAR is a lower-cost derivative of the ASARS-2 package that Hughes developed for the Lockheed U-2. HISAR is also fitted in the US Army's RC-7B Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARLM) manned surveillance aircraft, and is being sold on the international market. HISAR integrates a SAR-MTI system, along with an optical and an infrared imager. All three sensors are controlled and their outputs filtered by a common processor. The digital sensor data can be transmitted at up to 50 Mbit/s to a ground station in real time, either directly or through a communications satellite link. The SAR-MTI system operates in the X-band and provides a number of operational modes: * The wide- area MTI mode can detect moving targets within a radius of . * The combined SAR-MTI strip mode provides 6 meter (20 ft) resolution over a swath wide at ranges from 20 to 110 kilometers (12.4 to 68 miles). * The SAR spot mode can provide 1.8 meter (6 ft) resolution over ten square kilometers (3.8 square miles), as well as provide a sea-surveillance function. The visible and infrared imagers share the same gimballed sensor package, and use common optics, providing a telescopic close-up capability. The Global Hawk is also fitted with a \\"self-protection\\" countermeasures suite to help it frustrate adversary air defenses, and can be optionally fitted with an auxiliary SIGINT package. First flight of the Global Hawk was on 28 February 1998. Five prototypes were built, and put through a thorough flight test program. Beginning in the spring of 1999, the Global Hawk performed a series of operational evaluation flights, some of which were remarkable demonstrations of the aircraft's capability. One of the prototypes flew from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to Alaska and back again, nonstop, in just under 25 hours. In May 2000, a prototype flew up the Atlantic coast of the US from Eglin AFB, transmitting radar images to a US Army ground station at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, at dock at Norfolk, Virginia. The RQ-4A then proceeded across the Atlantic, monitoring shipping movements, and reached its final target, an amphibious landing exercise near Setubal, Portugal. Once done, the Global Hawk retraced its steps and landing at Eglin, 28 hours after its departure. The program has suffered some setbacks. On 29 March 1999, the second prototype fell out of the sky over the US Navy China Lake military training area in California and was destroyed. The third prototype was badly damaged during a landing on 6 December 1999 when a software bug told the aircraft to taxi at 290 km/h (180 mph), leading to the grounding of the survivors for three months. The Global Hawk was scheduled to reach operational service in late 2001, and this timeframe coincided with the US intervention in Afghanistan. Four Global Hawks were available at the time, though only three were regarded as suitable for operations. These three UAVs were operated in the war, though specific details of their missions are unclear. One crashed on 30 December 2001 due to a malfunction. Global Hawks also served in the invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003. Although details of their service there are sketchy for the moment, apparently their SAR payload came in very handy for pinning down targets during intense sandstorms. Ironically, despite the service of the Global Hawks in these conflicts, none of them that flew these operations were actually regarded as production machines. The first production RQ-4A, the eighth Global Hawk built, was finally rolled out in the summer of 2003. * The Global Hawk is a very high priority program for the Air Force. The service expects to obtain two Block 5 aircraft each year, and then move on to Block 10 aircraft when the system has been proven. The Block 10 aircraft will feature an improved sensor and self- protection suite, and more electrical power. The improved self-protection suite includes an AN/ALE-50 towed decoy, an AN/ALR-89 radar-warning receiver, and a new self-defense jammer being designed by Raytheon. The UAV will autonomously act on the information from the self-protection system, deciding whether to abort the mission, take evasive action, or continue with the towed jammer deployed. The remote operator can override whatever decision is taken. * One high-profile update for the Global Hawk is now being pursued under the \\"Mult-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP)\\", which will give the UAV an advanced \\"active electronically scanned array (AESA)\\" multifunction radar. MP-RTIP originally started out as an upgrade program for the \\"E-8 Joint-STARS\\" manned battlefield reconnaissance aircraft, which is based on the Boeing 707-320 jetliner, but the scope of the program expanded to envision the development of an AESA that could be adapted for use on a range of platforms. An AESA can be thought of as a radio-frequency (RF) \\"array processor\\", composed of a grid of interconnected \\"transmit-receive\\" modules, each with its own RF, processing, and control electronics. The modules can work with each other to perform a wide variety of tasks. The AESA is scalable, allowing the fit of more or fewer modules as allowed by the size of the platform, with capability proportional to size. The AESA can perform communications, jamming, and sensing functions in parallel through juggling the use of its modules. Current thinking on the Global Hawk AESA is also placing increased emphasis on providing airborne search functions to the system to allow the UAV to operate as an \\"airborne early warning (AEW)\\" platform. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman were awarded a contract for the MP-RTIP system in late 2000, with Raytheon to build the AESA and the Northrop Grumman to perform systems integration. The Global Hawk was selected as the initial target system for MP-RTIP, with initial flight tests in 2005. * Yet another high-priority update that is being considered for the Global Hawk is to fit it with a SIGINT payload. This option was being considered as a long-term program until the spring of 2001, when a Chinese F-8 fighter trying to \\"spook\\" a US Navy EP-3 Aries SIGINT aircraft cruising off the Chinese coast collided with it instead. The F-8 and its pilot were lost, and the EP-3 was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island. The result was a protracted diplomatic quarrel, with the Chinese holding the aircraft and the crew and demanding that the US end surveillance of Chinese territory. The crew was returned unharmed, but the Chinese refused to let the EP-3 fly out, forcing the Americans to retrieve with a leased Antonov transport. The 1969 shootdown of an EC-121 SIGINT aircraft by the North Koreans led to the development of the \\"Combat Dawn\\" Firefly variant, and the 2001 incident led to widespread discussion of adopting a similar strategy to ensure that the problem would not arise again. While the Global Hawk does not have the payload capability to replace a large SIGINT aircraft like the EP-3, it would provide an interim solution if nothing else were available. The Global Hawk SIGINT payload is now a high priority. Other upgrades are also being considered, such as a fast-track effort to add stores pylons for external payloads, including improved electro-optic / infrared and multispectral sensors; or jamming pods. While a Global Hawk configuration carrying two 225 kilogram (500 pound) or four 112 kilogram (250 pound) GPS- guided bombs has been considered, senior Air Force brass are not enthusiastic about arming the type, since that would make it politically more difficult to use in peacekeeping operations or to obtain overflight permission from friendly nations. Another possible role is for \\"information warfare (IW)\\", picking up and penetrating enemy voice, video, and data communications, but currently no miniaturized IW payload suitable for the Global Hawk is available. Northrop Grumman is promoting schemes where several Global Hawks with different but complementary payloads could be used to perform a single mission. Current USAF plans project 40 to 45 Global Hawks in service by 2010 and 78 in service by 2020, with 40 carrying electro-optic payloads and the other 38 carrying SIGINT payloads. The Air Force expects to retire their aging U-2 reconnaissance aircraft no later than 2011, and are hesitantly considering the Global Hawk as the replacement. Lockheed Martin has been promoting a UAV version of the U-3 designated the \\"U-2U\\" as an alternative to the Global Hawk, though so far with little success in the face of current Air Force commitments. Northrop Grumman is now building the \\"Block 20\\" or \\"RQ-4B\\" Global Hawk. This variant features an uprated engine; a wingspan stretch from 35.4 meters (116 ft) to 39.9 meters (130.9 ft); and a fuselage stretch from 13.5 meters (44 ft) to up to 14.5 meters (47.6 ft). The RQ-4B provides 50% more electrical power than the RQ-4A and carry a larger payload, of up to 1,360 kilograms (3,000 pounds) as opposed to 910 kilograms (2,000 pounds), and also has an improved communications system and an \\"open architecture\\" that makes updates simpler. An even bigger Global Hawk derivative, designed to carry a jamming payload of up to 2,720 kilograms (6,000 pounds), is under consideration. * Following the conflict in Afghanistan, the US Navy also became interested in the Global Hawk, ordering two for delivery in 2005. The two UAVs will be used to evaluate concepts for a naval endurance UAV under the \\"Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)\\" program. BAMS would complement manned maritime patrol aircraft, such as the P-3C Orion or its successor, the Boeing 737-based \\"Multimission Maritime Aircraft (MMA)\\", and the Navy would like to field BAMS by 2008. The Navy wants BAMS to have an operational radius of 2,775 kilometers (1,500 nmi) and an on-station time of 12 hours. It would carry an extensive payload suite, with EO/IR imaging sensors; a radar with sea-air-land wide-area search, high-resolution spot beam, MTI, and SAR imaging modes; and a SIGINT package with emitter identification and targeting capabilities. Payload systems will be modular, and it may not be possible to carry a complete suite on a single machine. BAMS would operate from land bases, but it could be controlled by airborne and maritime platforms as well. Navy officials say they have not selected the Global Hawk for the application, but have also indicated they basically want to modify an off-the-shelf UAV instead of building one from scratch, and so the Global Hawk is a high-profile candidate. However, General Atomics and Lockheed Martin are aggressively pursuing the BAMS requirement as well, offering a \\"Predator B-ER (Extended Range)\\" known as the \\"Mariner\\" with more power, payload, and endurance, and with the capability to carry an AESA radar up to 16 air-dropped sensors or munitions. The BAMS requirement remains completely up in the air for the moment. Northrop Grumman has been trying to sell the Global Hawk internationally, and has had European interest in a EuroHawk and Middle Eastern interest in a \\"GulfHawk\\". Japan and Australia are considering the type as well, but nobody expects international sales any time soon. * Northrop Grumman has conducted preliminary investigations for the USAF Research Lab of a follow-on HALE vehicle, known as the \\"Sensor Craft\\", which would have greater endurance and payload. One Northrop Grumman concepts features a diamond-shaped \\"joined wing\\" airfoil, with long conventional airfoil extensions. Boeing has also produced Sensor Craft concepts, featuring a pure joined-wing airfoil. Sensor Craft appears to be a purely experimental program, but the confrontation between the US and China over the EP-3 SIGINT aircraft in the spring of 2001 helped increase interest in a new, large surveillance UAV. Many defense officials are now promoting acquisition of a large, capable UAV designated the \\"U-X\\" with stealthy characteristics that can fly at altitudes above the ceiling of a piloted interceptor.\` The UAV would not necessarily be designed to overfly protected airspace. One or two dozen such UAVs would be bought at a minimum total price of $1.5 billion USD. Ironically, if the new UAV is built, it will bring the US full circle, back to the \\"Tier 3\\" UAV that was cancelled early in the 1990s.

UCAV origins = Cold War era 1945–1990 = During the 1960s the US Navy installed thousands of QH-50 DASH torpedo-launching helicopter drones on many of their destroyers. They were meant as a stopgap measure to counter the threat of an ever-growing fleet of Soviet attack submarines. The entire fleet was retired when larger destroyers were introduced, permitting the use of manned helicopters to launch the same kind of torpedo, and the use of more powerful rocket-assisted torpedo systems. If UAVs could be used for reconnaissance by the army and the air force, it was obvious that they could also be used for active combat missions, at least in principle. In practice, shooting at a specific ground target is much trickier than flying over an area and taking pictures, and it wasn't until the 1970s that the US Air Force seriously experimented with the concept. The objective was to study an attack system to perform the dangerous \\"suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)\\" mission, or in other words to destroy enemy anti-aircraft gun and SAM sites. The project was known as HAVE LEMON. Ryan Firebee HAVE LEMON involved a number of Ryan Firebees equipped with a weapons pylon under each wing, a forward-looking TV camera, and a datalink mounted in a pod on top of the vertical tailplane. These UAVs were given the designation \\"BGM-34A\\" and used beginning in late 1971 to perform remote-control strikes on simulated air-defense sites with Maverick missiles and HOBOS TV-guided glide bombs. The results were good enough to permit follow-on development, resulting in the \\"BGM-34B\\", which featured an extended nose to accommodate an infrared imaging system (some sources say low-light- level TV) and laser designator for targeting and control of laser-guided bombs. Tests performed in 1973 and 1974 with the BGM-34B were also successful, and led Teledyne Ryan to develop a \\"BGM-34C\\" as a conversion of existing Lightning Bug airframes. The BGM-34C could be used for reconnaissance or strike missions by swapping out nose modules and other elements. The concept proved to be a little too far ahead of its time. Nobody in the Air Force hierarchy stepped forward to take ownership of the issue, and the HAVE LEMON exercise faded away. The test squadron was disbanded in 1979 and its roughly 60 UAVs were put into storage. However, in the summer of 2003 a UAV \\"airshow\\" of sorts was conducted, in which a Firebee was displayed carrying two Hellfire anti-armor missiles, as well as a pod for dispensing remote battlefield sensors; apparently Northrop Grumman was running the idea up a flagpole to see if anyone would salute. UAV advocates claim the Air Force abandoned UAVs for strike missions because of inclination of \\"hotshot flyboys\\" to keep the mission for themselves, but in fact the concept has always suffered from \\"command and control\\" problems, such as the vulnerability of communications links to jamming and spoofing, and the need to hit specific targets and not accidentally kill civilians or friendly troops.  Air To Air Combat  As attention focused on the combat capabilities of attack drones, the USN and USAF were looking for drones that could turn 6Gs and quickly roll into tight turns. While at the same time, US designers were wondering if dog-fights between robot planes were just around the corner.Wagner p. 186 The US Navy's Fighter Weapons School established in 1969 at Miramar Naval Air Station in California, better known as Top Gun, was tasked with supplying the USN with trained jet pilots for aerial combat missions over the skies of North Vietnam.Wagner p. 188 From 25 January through 28 April 1971 a batch of Maneuverability Augmentation System for Tactical Air Combat Simulation (MASTACS) systems were modified onto existing US Navy BQM-34A drones (UAVs). These UAVs were test flown to evaluate their maneuvering characteristics, which were deemed good. On 10 May 1971, the MASTACS exercise was ready to commence off the coast of California, against two USN F4 Phantoms flown by Vietnam combat experienced pilots, who had been students at the Top Gun school. The F4s were equipped with both the infrared homing Sidewinder and radar-guided Sparrow air-to-air missiles. As the two F4s approached Santa Catalina Island, a MASTAC-equipped Firebee was ground-launched. The F4s were vectored towards the interception and the air-to-air battle was on. No restrictions were placed on the F4 pilots, the air battle was to be a \\"no holds barred contest\\", with the very real possibility of a Phantom being rammed by a UAV as it maneuvered during the dogfight. The first action was a head-on maneuver, as the Phantom lined up for the kill, the UAV (drone) pulled a high-G turn and flew over the F4's canopy. The Firebee was banking into 100-degree maneuvers, and making 180-degree reversal turns within 12 seconds. The Phantoms were no longer attacking the UAV, they were now the targets! The UAVs had been able to pull and hold 6 Gs within three seconds of receiving the command, and still maintain altitude. The Phantoms were unable to maintain track on the UAV, but fired their air-to-air missiles anyway, receiving no hits.Wagner p. 189 = 1990s onward = Over the next two decades, more reliable communications links were developed, automated systems came into much wider use, and the military learned to be much more comfortable with such new technologies. In the late 1990s, the concept of using UAVs for performing actual combat, was revived in the form of various designs generally designated as \\"uninhabited combat air vehicles\\". One of the initial concepts was to develop a UCAV on a fast track for \\"air occupation\\". The idea was to use unpiloted aircraft to fly continuous patrols over hostile territory, with some of the aircraft fitted with sophisticated sensors to identify enemy activities and target them, and other aircraft following up with attacks. The idea was obviously inspired by USAF air patrols over Iraq and the Balkans. Lockheed Martin suggested rebuilding old F-16A fighters as UAVs, fitting them with a wide wing to provide additional fuel, and also permit carriage of six or more air-to-surface weapons to provide the air-occupation strike element. The modified F-16As would have had endurance of 8 hours over a target area, and three sets of them could maintain 24-hour coverage. The United States Navy also began studies for UCAVs at about the same time. The Navy saw that UCAVs had a number of potential benefits. They promised to be cheaper than manned aircraft, with a lower purchase cost and much lower operating costs, since operators could be given much of their training through simulations. UCAVs would also be smaller and stealthier than manned aircraft, and could perform High-G maneuvers impossible with piloted aircraft, allowing them to dodge missiles and enemy fighters. Indeed, since the Navy found themselves increasingly committed to the use of expensive cruise missiles to perform punitive strikes and other limited military operations, UCAVs offered a potentially cheaper alternative, a \\"reusable cruise missile\\". One UCAV could carry a number of smart GPS-guided munitions and hit multiple targets on a single sortie, and then return home to be used again. Even with a high combat attrition rate, the cost would be less than that of a barrage of cruise missiles. Lockheed Martin performed studies that envisioned a number of different naval UCAV configurations, including \\"short takeoff and landing (STOVL)\\" aircraft that could be operated off of aircraft carriers, or \\"vertical attitude takeoff and landing (VTOL)\\" or \\"pogo\\" aircraft that could be operated off destroyers and other surface combat ships, or even submarines. Piloted pogo aircraft were flight-tested in the 1950s and proved a technological dead end at the time, since they couldn't carry a useful payload and were extremely difficult to land even under benign conditions. The payload limitations can be addressed with lighter materials and RATO-boosted takeoff, and modern digital flight control systems can address the landing issue. The Navy has envisioned using pogo UCAVs to arm a guided-missile destroyer \\"unmanned air wing\\" with 20 pogo UCAVs for strike, and five pogo UAVs for reconnaissance. The submarine launch concept was even more speculative, since recovery was a problem. The Lockheed Martin UCAV concepts were in the 4.5 tonne (10,000 pound) weight class and carried a warload of 450 kilograms (1,000 pounds). Weapons were carried internally to improve stealth and consisted of 45 kilogram (100 pound) and 115 kilogram (250 pound) small smart bombs, now under development. Range would be about , with capability for probe-and-drogue aerial refueling. Top speed would be in the high subsonic range, and ceiling would be about 12.2 kilometers (40,000 ft). The UCAVs would be equipped with fairly simple radar or electro-optical sensors to give the operators imagery of the target. Long-range sensing would be provided by other platforms in air or space. One Lockheed Martin UCAV concept was an arrowhead- shaped vehicle with no vertical surfaces and the air intake on top. A shaft- driven lift fan would exhaust through the nosewheel door for vertical landings, while the nose sensor array would pivot forward to expose the intakes for the lift fan. The UCAV would have a retractable refueling probe, communications antennas mounted on the aircraft's spine, and lights for navigation and refueling operations. Moveable wingtips and control surfaces along the sawtooth rear edge of the UCAV would eliminate the need for vertical stabilizers. Another Lockheed-Martin UCAV concept envisioned a diamond-shaped tailless flying wing, with an engine buried down the centerline, and conformal weapons bays flanking the engine. For greater stealth, the UCAV would flip onto its featureless back and fly upside-down. = Overview = Such UCAVs could be available in several versions: one with an afterburning engine for maximum performance; one with a non-afterburning engine, but with a thrust- vectoring exhaust for better maneuverability; and one with a conventional non- afterburning engine for low cost. UCAVs missions would be conducted by an operator in a ground vehicle, warship, or control aircraft over a high speed digital data link. The operator would not really be flying the UCAV directly, however, since the robot would be able to handle the details of flight operations by itself, leaving the operator in a supervisory role. The UCAV would be able to complete its mission autonomously if communications were cut. USAF / Boeing X-45 UCAV Boeing X-45A In March 1999, DARPA awarded a contract to Boeing for two \\"X-45A\\" UCAV technology demonstrators ahead of Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Boeing rolled out the first prototype for public presentation at Saint Louis, Missouri, in September 2000. First flight was on 22 May 2002, from Edwards Air Force Base in California, and was followed a few months later by the second prototype. The first demonstrator was built to a \\"Block 1\\" standard, with a UHF control link and an L-band telemetry link. The second demonstrator was built to \\"Block 2\\" standard, with an added UHF satellite communications link and a \\"Link 16\\" fighter data link, and the first machine was updated to that standard. The two demonstrators were then flown on cooperative test missions. The tests investigated operation of multiple UCAVs in military operations; integration of UCAVs with other military operations; and the feasibility of using reservists to fly the robot aircraft. There has since been X-45B/C versions with greater fuel capacity and hence longer range. US Navy / Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus UCAV X-47A Pegasus The US Navy did not commit to practical UCAV efforts until the summer of 2000, when the service awarded contracts of US$2 million each to Boeing and Northrop Grumman for a 15-month concept-exploration program. Design considerations for a naval UCAV included dealing with the corrosive salt-water environment, deck handling for launch and recovery, integration with command and control systems, and operation in a carrier's high electromagnetic interference environment. The Navy was also interested in using their UCAVs for reconnaissance missions, penetrating protected airspace to identify targets for the attack waves. The Navy went on to give Northrop Grumman a contract for a naval UCAV demonstrator with the designation of \\"X-47A Pegasus\\", in early 2001. The Pegasus was rolled out on 30 July 2001 and performed its first flight on 23 February 2003 at the US Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake, California. US Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) Both the Air Force and the Navy had been developing plans for operational follow-ons to their respective demonstrator programs, but pressures rose for the two services to merge their efforts, resulting in the formation of the \\"Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS)\\" program in October 2003 under DARPA direction. Of course, the candidates for the J-UCAS program include follow-ons to the X-45A and the X-47A. DARPA and Boeing had been working on the \\"X-45B\\", a scaled-up X-45A that was seen as the prototype for an operational machine that would reach service in 2008, and would carry a 1,590 kilogram (3,500 pound) load to a combat radius of 1,665 kilometers (900 nautical miles). Two were to be built, but before any metal could be bent for the two X-45B prototypes planned, the Air Force redirected the effort to an even more capable machine, the \\"X-45C\\". The goal of the J-UCAS effort was to select a single contractor to provide from 10 to 12 machines for operational evaluation in the 2007:2008 time frame. Current plans are to obtain two X-45Cs and two X-47Bs to perform a comparative evaluation and then select a winner for development in the 2010 time frame. The USAF envisioned that J-UCAS will feature: * Stores pylons on the wings for external fuel tanks or additional munitions. * Mid-air refueling capability. * A narrow field-of-view SAR-MTI system for targeting and post-strike damage assessment. The Navy is interested in many of the features on the Air Force wish list, though the Navy has put reconnaissance and jamming at the top of the list and strike at the bottom. In the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review it was stated that the J-UCAS program would be terminated and instead a new long-range strategic bomber program has been launched. USAF Hunter-Killer This is the U.S. Air Force program for which several companies have developed vehicles. In the 2004, the U.S. Air Force, in need of a less expensive short-term UCAV solution with a focus on endurance, opened up a competition for a \\"Hunter-Killer\\" UCAV. Specifications include: * An operating altitude of 10.7 to 15.25 kilometers (35,000 to 50,000 feet). * Endurance from 16 to 30 hours or more carrying a load of 1,360 kilograms (3,000 pounds), in specific six 225 kilogram (500 pound) guided bombs. * Fit of SAR/MTI or EO/IR sensors and laser target designator. Of course, the Hunter-Killer would be capable of performing surveillance or reconnaissance missions along with its active combat role. The Air Force wants to field the Hunter-Killer by 2007 and may order up to 60 machines. The program seems on avoiding expensive custom made components (\\"gold plate\\"), instead preferring \\"off-the-shelf\\" avionics. International UCAV development efforts There is considerable interest in UCAVs elsewhere, but so far matters have not advanced as far as they have in the US. The British displayed a concept UCAV designated \\"Proteus\\", of no relation to the Scaled Composites Proteus. It was essentially a reusable cruise missile, with a long chisel- shaped fuselage with a hexagonal cross section, pop-out forward-swept wings, and triangular tailfins. It was apparently to be recovered by parachute and can carry a number of different warloads. The Swedish government has worked with the SAAB company to perform studies for a UCAV designated \\"SHARC\\", for \\"Swedish Highly Advanced Research Configuration\\". The study project was initiated in the late 1990s, and nine different configurations were considered, leading to selection of a single design. Low-speed wind tunnel tests were conducted in 1999, and included drop tests of plausible munitions fits from the SHARC's internal weapons bays. This was followed by a secret flight test of a subscale demonstrator in early 2002. The French Dassault Aviation firm has flown a subscale model of a stealthy UAV, designated the \\"Aeronef de Validation Experimentale (Experimental Air Vehicle / AVE\\", or \\"Petit DUC (Little Demonstrator UAV)\\". The AVE is intended to demonstrate Dassault's expertise in stealthy aircraft design, and could lead to UCAVs, reconnaissance UAVs, and high-speed expendable targets. First flight of the Petit DUC was in July 2000. The Petit DUC is a manta-ray-like black diamond of an aircraft, with twin tails and an engine intake on the back of the aircraft. It has retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by twin AMT engines. Wingspan and length are both 2.4 meters (7.9 ft), empty weight is 35 kilograms (77 pounds), loaded weight is 60 kilograms (132 pounds), operational radius is about , and top speed is about 600 km/h (350 mph). The Petit Duc was to be followed by a \\"Moyen (Medium) DUC\\" demonstrator, and then a \\"Grand DUC\\" demonstrator. However, in late 2004 the direction of the effort changed somewhat. The French DGA defense procurement agency initiated a government effort to fly a UCAV demonstrator by 2008 and stated that a contract would be awarded to Dassault in early 2004. This led to interest from a number of European countries, including Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, and Greece, in creating a joint effort with France to develop an operational UCAV, named \\"Neuron\\". Germany is interested but has not moved to sign up just yet. Israel The first time UAVs drones were used as proof-of-concept of super- agility post-stall controlled flight in combat flight simulations was with tailless, Stealth-Technology-based three-dimensional Thrust Vectoring flight control jet steering was in Israel in 1987. Israel is interested in armed UAVs and it is believed that IDF drones have been used to perform precision strikes in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Israel has customized the Elbit Hermes 450 UAV to carry two Hellfire missiles and this UCAV has been fully operational for several years. IAI recently rolled out the IAI Eitan, a huge UCAV with anti- ballistic and assault capabilities. The Eitan has a wingspan of 26 meters and a takeoff weight of four tons, about four times the weight of the largest UAV now in the Israel Air Force. According to the Israeli Air Force, the aircraft has advanced avionics on a level similar to that of systems that operate on fighter-jets, operates with complete autonomy and allows the operator to focus more on performing the mission and less on flying the air platform. Industry sources have said that the Eitan would be a multi-purpose UCAV that could carry out reconnaissance and attack missions, including the ability to locate and destroy mobile ballistic missile launchers. Israeli officials have for several years been interested in a large, piston-powered UCAV that would loiter at high altitude and dispense smart munitions as required by ground or other forces, acting basically as a flying fire-support base. At present the Israelis are keeping very quiet about specifics. The Israelis are very enthusiastic about UAVs, seeing them as the way of the future, since they will permit Israel to perform surveillance, strike, and other missions with much less risk to personnel and at a fraction of the acquisition and operational cost of manned aircraft. Other In the spring of 2003, Alenia Aeronautica of Italy unveiled a non-flying ground-test prototype of a half-scale UCAV demonstrator, known as an \\"Integration Technology Vehicle (ITV)\\", with a flight prototype to follow. Other UCAV efforts have included the stealthy Seraph proposed by Kentron of South Africa; a number of UCAV design concepts proposed by the European Aerospace & Defense Systems (EADS) conglomerate, a merger of Matra-Aerospatiale of France, DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and CASA of Spain; and a number of vague proposals from the Russians.

He was one of the leaders of the civilian resistance to the Chilean invasion at the Battle of Topáter. Abaroa was an engineer by trade, working in a silver mine located in the coastal region of Litoral, which Chile took from Bolivia during the War of the Pacific. During the Battle of Topáter (23 March 1879), the first armed clash of the war, Colonel Abaroa was part of a badly outnumbered Bolivian force defending a bridge that crossed the Topáter River and gave access to the city of Calama, an important desert oasis on the road to Bolivia. Refusing to surrender, after the outnumbered Bolivian military forces withdrew, he fought to his last breath, a feat that later transformed him into a revered national hero. When, injured and surrounded, he was asked to surrender by the Chilean forces, he provided an answer that has gone into Bolivian folklore: \\"¿Rendirme yo? ¡Que se rinda su abuela, carajo!\\" (\\"Surrender? Your grandmother [is who] should surrender, you bastard!\\", or \\"Surrender, me? Let your grandmother surrender, dammit!\\", or, more literally, \\"Surrender, me? That your grandmother surrender herself, fuck!\\"), equivalent to saying \\"Surrender? Surrender my ass!\\". According to Chilean folklore, he answered: \\"¿Quién, yo?\\" (\\"Who, me?\\") Legacy and critical discussion In 1952, on the 73rd anniversary of his death, the Bolivian Government repatriated Abaroa's body, burying it with full honors and in the midst of an impressive crowd (numbering in the tens of thousands) in the popular La Paz square that bears the hero's name. Plaza Abaroa (Abaroa Square) also contains a large bronze statue of the Bolivian martyr, presented in full pose and defiance, as he would have looked the moment before his death. His country honored him with a series of stamps (Scott#365-370 and C157-162). The stamps quoted his last words, eliding \\"carajo\\" with an ellipsis. Eduardo Abaroa Province is named in his honor, as is Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve. The anniversary of Abaroa's heroic death (March 23) is the national holiday in Bolivia Día del Mar, or the Day of the Sea.

Publication history Scarecrow's first appearance was in Tales of Suspense #51 (March 1964), in a story created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Fictional character biography Ebenezer Laughton was born in Rhinebeck, New York, as the son of a farmer, along with his brother Ralph.Captain America #279-280 Raised by an abusive mother, Laughton became a circus escape artist and contortionist, and while working as a carnival performer once helped Iron Man apprehend a fleeing culprit. However, he decided to make his profit in crime and became an accomplished burglar and professional thief while dressed as a scarecrow. He mostly worked alone—except for a flock of trained crows which served as carriers and killers. In his first appearance as the Scarecrow, he was defeated by Iron Man.Tales of Suspense #51 He joined Count Nefaria's short- lived team of super-mercenaries (which included Plantman, the original Eel, the original Porcupine, the original Unicorn and himself), and participated in Count Nefaria's attempt to hold Washington, D.C., for ransom before being defeated by the X-Men.X-Men Vol. 1 #22-23 He later worked for the Cowled Commander, but was defeated by Captain America and the Falcon.Captain America #158-159 He then clashed with Captain America once more.Captain America Annual #6 Eventually, Laughton went insane, and he began murdering supporters of the Coalition for an Upstanding America, but was defeated by Captain America. It was revealed in Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin that Laughton was motivated in part to become a supervillain by agents of the Mandarin who supplied him with his first costume and trained crows. He was allured by the idea of standing out in the growing field of industrial espionage. Scarecrow embarked on a series of murders, and first battled the second Ghost Rider. He fell and was impaled on his own pitchfork during the battle with Ghost Rider, and was carried off by the Firm.Ghost Rider Vol. 2 #7 He received surgical implants, carried out more killings, and abducted Stacy Dolan. He fought Captain America and Ghost Rider, surviving being shot and impaled, and was then enlisted by Mr. Stern for the Firm.Ghost Rider/Captain America: Fear He became undead, raised by the sorcerer Stern. Before this he possessed no superhuman powers save for his \\"rubber man\\" ability, but after his resurrection he gained superhuman strength, speed and endurance as well as the supernatural ability to induce fear. He also gained the ability to recover from any injury so long as he was in the presence of the fear of others. The Ghost Rider used this ability against the Scarecrow, briefly mangling his body, causing Scarecrow to heal in a crooked and contorted pose. He was later restored to his normal physical appearance by the government agent called Spook during the Ghost Rider in Chains story arc. Laughton's physiology and mentality would fluctuate quite a bit over the years, given his employ/manipulation by various demonic/magical entities, resulting in continuing conflict with Ghost Rider and his allies, even becoming a body-hopping ghost during one such campaign. Eventually, Laughton would be abandoned by these \\"magical employers,\\" and stabilize physically, if not mentally. Scarecrow was jailed in the Raft prison facility following a failed sexual assault upon hostages who were freed by the Falcon.New Avengers #1-3 Scarecrow is among the army of villains recruited by Zemo and his Thunderbolts to serve as \\"hero-hunters\\" during the events of the Civil War storyline.Thunderbolts #103 Scarecrow showed up when Peter Parker unmasked himself, as one of a band of costumed villains (including Electro, the Molten Man, and Will o' the Wisp), hired by the Chameleon to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort. Scarecrow was defeated and incarcerated.Sensational Spider-Man vol. 3 #29-31 He later teamed again with Molten Man in a rampage which was halted by Captain America and the Punisher. The two criminals were sent as part of the \\"Thunderbolt Army\\" to flush heroes out of hiding. Cap was forced to prevent Punisher from killing Scarecrow once he'd been apprehended.Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #2 Ebenezer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative.Avengers: The Initiative #1Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map Someone that looks like Scarecrow was among the members of Hood's Crime Syndicate.New Avengers #35 (2007) He helped them assault the New Avengers' home until they were defeated.New Avengers Annual #6 In Secret Invasion, he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading Skrull force.Secret Invasion #6 He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 He is among the villains considered by Blackout and the Deacon to help them assassinate the Ghost Rider.Ghost Rider vol. 6 #33 He worked alongside Blackout and other villains on a mission to kill Ghost Rider,Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire #2 but was eventually defeated when Jaine Cutter bent his body around a carnival fence.Ghost Rider: Heaven's On Fire #5 Scarecrow has also teamed up with Raoul Bushman as his right-hand man, in the 2009-2010 Moon Knight series.Vengeance Of The Moon Knight #3-5 He was later seen during the Siege of Asgard as part of the Hood's crime syndicate.Siege #3 During the Fear Itself storyline, Scarecrow takes advantage of the chaos in town by attacking with his army of crows only to end up fighting Wolverine.Fear Itself: Wolverine #1  Weapons, abilities and equipment  The Scarecrow is a highly adept contortionist—extremely flexible and agile due to heavy training. He is double-jointed and can fit his body through any aperture at least one foot wide. He is therefore able to escape from conventional locks and chains, and to perform various acrobatic stunts. He is also a master at training birds. He often carries a pitchfork as a weapon. He has a flock of two dozen pet crows, which he has taught to perform a variety of actions in response to his hand gestures and tones of voice. At his command, the crows will attack and kill the victims he designates. The crows have been trained to attack anyone who rushes at the Scarecrow or points a gun at him. They are trained to carry off jewels, valuables, and anything else at which the Scarecrow points. As a result of surgical implants given to him by doctors employed by the Firm, the Scarecrow's body produces a mutated pheromone that affects the adrenal glands of people and animals (even crows) within twenty feet of him, causing a sensory overload which triggers a panic attack. The same pheromone affects the Scarecrow's own adrenal system, giving him superhuman strength and stamina. When the Scarecrow was raised from the dead by the sorcerer Stern, he became able to directly induce fear in his victims, and could survive and quickly recover from any injury, even typically fatal ones, as long as he was in the presence of the fear of others.Ghost Rider Annual #2 (1994) Other versions =Marvel vs. DC= In Marvel vs. DC, Scarecrow briefly teamed up with DC's Scarecrow in an attempt to kidnap Lois Lane.

Miniature UAVs range from micro air vehicles (MAVs) that can be carried by an infantryman, to man-portable UAVs that can be carried and launched like an infantry man- portable air-defense system. The term is usually applied to those used for military purposes. SUAVs have been given various definitions among national regulation authorities, often without including size precisions and differing about weight measurement specifications. Those definitions range from less than 2 kg for Canada to less than 25 kg for the United States. UE's SESAR prospective for the 2020 Air Traffic Management rules also proposed less than 25 kg, while UK's CAA stated less than 20 kg. MAVs and mesicopters The notion that small, even very small, UAVs might have practical uses arose in the early 1990s. In 1992, DARPA conducted a workshop titled \\"Future Technology-Driven Revolutions In Military Operations\\". One of the topics in the workshop was \\"mobile microrobots\\". The idea of using very small \\"microdrones\\" was discussed, and after initial skepticism the idea started to gain momentum. The RAND Corporation released a paper on the microdrone concept in 1994 that was widely circulated (Reference 12). DARPA conducted a series of \\"paper studies\\" and workshops on the concept in 1995 and 1996, leading to early engineering studies by the Lincoln Laboratories at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. The studies demonstrated that the concept was feasible. In 1997, DARPA then began a multi-year, US$35 million development program to develop \\"micro air vehicles (MAVs)\\". The MAV project's goals was to develop a microdrone whose largest dimension was no more than 15 centimeters (6 inches); would carry a day-night imager; have an endurance of about two hours; and be very low cost. It would operate with a high degree of autonomy to be used in the squad-level combat environment. MAVs capable of hovering and vertical flight would be used to scout out buildings for urban combat and counter terrorist operations. A MAV could be included in a pilot's survival kit. A downed pilot could use it to keep track of enemy search parties, or as airborne radio relays to search and rescue units. =Phase-two MAVs= This phase-one DARPA study ended in 2001, and was followed by a phase-two study that focused on particular vendors with an intent to develop MAVs closer to operational specification. A number of different MAVs were developed as part of these DARPA efforts: ;Lockheed Sanders \\"Microstar\\" :The Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. An initial design had a fat teardrop body with stubby cropped-delta wings running along most of the body, along with a single vertical tailplane and a pusher propeller. A later version had winglets instead of the single vertical tailplane, and a nose mounted propeller. The MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could be given directions by the ground station, but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target. ;CIT, AeroVironment and UCLA \\"MicroBat\\" ornithopter :The MicroBat ornithopter from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working with AeroVironment and the University of California, Los Angeles. The ornithopter design concept followed experiments conducted in the mid-1990s by Charles Ellington, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues, in which mechanical analogues of insect wings were tested in a wind tunnel. The group was only interested in studying the biomechanics of insects and was extremely surprised that somebody seemed interested in them. The CalTech / AeroVironment MicroBat ornithopter was test-flown for short distances under battery power. Researchers performing flight tests with the MicroBat said it tended to attract small birds when it ran low on power and fell to the ground. The birds clustered near the floundering ornithopter in what seemed to be a desire to help. :Other research groups also worked on ornithopters. A Georgia Tech Research Institute group built a rubber-band powered entomopter and also did research on a chemically powered Reciprocating Chemical Muscle propulsion system. ;Lutronix Corporation \\"Kolibri\\" micro- helicopter :The Kolibri micro-helicopter built by Lutronix Corporation of Del Mar, California. The Kolibri (German for \\"Hummingbird\\") was larger than the other DARPA MAV prototypes, with a weight of about 300 grams. The Kolibri was built as a cylinder with rotors at one or both ends, using vanes moved through the rotor airflow by piezoelectric actuators for flight control. It was powered by electric motors or a tiny, highly efficient multi-fuel engine developed by a company named D-STAR. ;Micro Craft \\"SLADF\\" ducted fan micro- helicopter :The Small Lift Augmented Ducted Fan (SLADF) ducted-fan micro- helicopter, built by Micro Craft of San Diego, California, and Ontario, Canada. The SLADF was a ducted fan helicopter with a diameter of about 15 centimeters (6 inches) and a weight of 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds), with payload. The SLADF did not appear to use a contra-rotating rotor design, using a single rotor with aerodynamic deflection surfaces inside the duct to cancel torque. First flight test of the SLADF was in late 2000. The SLADF could be fitted with an optional wing to provide useful lift to increase loiter time, and also provided additional fuel storage. ;AeroVironment \\"Black Widow\\" flying-wing :The AeroVironment Black Widow MAV. Developed by a team led by Matt Keenon, the Black Widow was powered by electric motor driving a small propeller in the nose, with a lithium battery permitting about 20 minutes of flight. It carried an off-the-shelf camera chip giving it a color video resolution of 510 by 492 pixels. While the first Black Widow prototype was a flat disk with a single vertical stabilizer and a propeller in the front, it was followed by an improved Black Widow that looked a little like a thin portable CD player with tapered edges and cut-off corners; a propeller in front; and three fins on the back. It did not have autonomous navigation capabilities, and was controlled essentially like a hobbyist's RC airplane. =Subsystems design= Along with the flight prototypes, the DARPA effort considered subsystems design. A useful operational MAV would need a lightweight, highly efficient engine with a power source with high energy density. Electric motors were becoming available that met the requirement, but power sources were more troublesome. Lithium batteries were marginal. New compact fuel cells were in development but weren't expected to be available for several years. One particularly intriguing option for both propulsion and power was a button-sized silicon microturbine (\\"jet\\") engine developed by Dr. Al Epstein at MIT during the 1990s. Silicon was actually a good structural material at such scales, though increasing operating temperature would have dictated use of silicon carbide. A production device was envisioned as a centrifugal-flow engine about two centimeters across burning natural gas, with a single turbine disk for compression and a single disk for exhaust rotation. The design didn't look much like a conventional turbojet, resembling more a tiny flat cylindrical box with an inlet hole on one side and an exhaust hole on the other. It was expected to have a thrust-to-weight ratio of about 100—incredible compared to any \\"macroscale\\" engine but a logical consequence of scaling the technology down in size—and run at about 1.2 million RPM, making bearings a tricky issue. Since it could \\"spool up\\" in about a millisecond, it was envisioned as operating in a pulsed mode to conserve fuel and also provide a throttling scheme. A functioning gas turbine was never successfully implemented at this scale after years of development. Other tricky issues were control systems, since an MAV couldn't be flown like a model airplane and would have to be able to tolerate turbulence and wind gusts, and miniaturizing navigation, communications, and sensor systems, as well as ensuring that they didn't interfere with each other. DARPA specified that the payload would be no more than 15 grams. =Stanford \\"Mesicopter\\"= As extreme as MAV specifications were, a team under Ilan Kroo at Stanford University worked on an even more extreme design in the form of a centimeter-wide four-rotor mesicopter using microcircuit fabrication techniques. The work was funded by NASA. Design of such a small aircraft was constrained by the fact that at such scales, the air becomes a highly viscous medium, or in aerodynamic terms a mesicopter had a low Reynolds number. Basic aerodynamics of the mesicopter were defined by a cycle of computer simulation, followed by tests of model components. The research led to mesicopter rotor designs where the rotor looked much more like the blades of an ordinary room fan than the rotor of a conventional helicopter. Propeller designs did not achieve desired efficiency and the Mesicopter was never able to lift the weight of its own energy source. MAVs rethought The DARPA MAV effort ended in 2000 and the results of the effort were somewhat negative, demonstrating that a 15 centimeter UAV was simply too small to be useful or even workable, at least over the short run. However, though the size was unrealistic, the basic concept seemed valid even if a larger machine were needed. DARPA did begin a follow-on effort in the spring of 2002, working with the US Army on a larger ducted fan vehicle as a follow- on to SLADF under the \\"Organic Air Vehicle (OAV)\\" program. Allied Aerospace, which had bought out Micro Craft, demonstrated a scaled-up SLADF, while Honeywell performed tests with their own ducted-fan vehicle, named iSTAR. However, neither vehicle seemed particularly promising and the program was cut short. It was revived as OAV-2 in 2004, with DARPA specifying a diesel-powered ducted-fan vertical-takeoff UAV with a weight of 51 kilograms (112 pounds), including a payload of 10 kilograms; a range of ; a top speed of 92 km/h (50 knots); the ability to hover in a 37 km/h (20 knots) wind; an endurance of two hours; and a ceiling of 3,350 meters (11,000 ft). The OAV was to be carried, launched, and recovered on a Humvee, using a crew of two soldiers, who would be able to get it flying in five minutes. Its sensor systems will be able to provide targeting data to within 10 meters (33 feet) to support non-line-of- sight weapons. The UAV would have autonomous flight capabilities with the ability to maneuver in cluttered terrain using an all-weather obstacle- avoidance system, and DARPA wanted it to have the ability to land and conduct observations from its landing site. Other possibilities were use of the UAV for communications relay, SIGINT, countermeasures, or even armed attack. The Army was interested in the program, but its current status is uncertain. It may have disappeared again; and if so it may reappear once more. =Black Widow \\"Wasp\\" and \\"Hornet\\"= AeroVironment has also worked on follow-ons to its Black Widow, named the Wasp and the Hornet. The Wasp is a flying wing, with the wing in the form of a rectangle with a slightly swept leading edge. It is propeller driven, with the propeller in front. The Wasp's main improvement over the Black Widow is that the lithium-ion battery and wing structures are one and the same, allowing maximum battery capacity relative to MAV size. The Wasp has a wingspan of 33 centimeters (13 inches) and a weight of 210 grams (6 ounces). Like the Black Widow, the Wasp is radio controlled. In the spring of 2003, AeroVironment performed the first flight of the Hornet, which is similar to the Wasp but has a straight rectangular wing with a slightly greater span of 38 centimeters (15 inches) and, more significantly, is powered by fuel cells. The fuel cells are built into the top of the wing, where they combine oxygen in the ambient air with hydrogen produced internally by the MAV through reaction of a hydride material with water. The fuel cell system is expected to provide three times the endurance of batteries of comparable weight, though early flights were limited by the tendency of the fuel cells to dry out. DARPA is actually more interested in the battery- powered Wasp, but other interested parties in the US defense establishment, particularly the NRL, are very intrigued by fuel cells, and so DARPA is hedging its bets. Ultimately, AeroVironment engineers want to fit their MAVs with an autopilot and a color video camera. =French \\"Mirador\\"= The French have done work along similar lines, with the French defence procurement agency (DGA in its French acronym) sponsoring a flight demonstrator, the Mirador. It was a fixed-wing, propeller-driven aircraft 25 centimeters (9.84 inches) long and was powered by miniature fuel cells that gave it an endurance of about 20 minutes. It was built by the French defense aerospace research agency ONERA, working with the Royal Military Academy of Brussels, and is primarily intended to be a testbed for miniature sensor technologies. The DGA envisions an operational MAV as about 40 centimeters (16 inches) long, with a weight of less than 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds), an endurance of 15 minutes or more, a ceiling of 100 meters (330 feet) and an operating radius of a kilometer (0.6 mile). For the moment, the concept seems strictly experimental. = Future smaller MAVs = The notion of bird-sized or even insect-sized MAVs has not disappeared, but is seen as a project for a future generation. MAVs have attracted a hobbyist and amateur community, similar to the robot combat competitions sometimes shown on television, and yearly competitive events have been conducted. These home-built MAVs necessarily show ingenuity rather than sophistication, but offer hope for an idea that will catch on. Research in 2005 included a model utilizing ground effect at NPS(), DelFly at TUDelft and Wageningen University, etc. Some also consider using a Reciprocating Chemical Muscle for actuating flapping wing MAVs such as the Entomopter pioneered by Robert C. Michelson of Georgia Tech's nonprofit Research Institute. Gun- launched & parasite UAVs =MIT \\"WASP\\"= Original WASP flyer and projectile The US Army has been interested in developing MAVs that could be deployed as munitions, fired from artillery or unguided rocket launcher pods. A research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has developed a prototype artillery-launched UAV. The UAV, named the Wide Area Surveillance Projectile (WASP), no relation to the AeroVironment Wasp, is fired out of a 127 millimeter (5 inch) naval gun. CAD representation of the WASP II Flyer The MIT group modified a standard illumination flare round to serve as the external case. After firing, the shell popped out six fins to keep it from tumbling. Once the shell was downrange, a parachute popped out of the tail to extract the drone. The parachute slowed the drone, which then unfolded into flight configuration. The WASP had a folding vee tail, a folding two-blade propeller up front, and two straight folding wings. The wings were folded into six sections and unfolded into a total span of 94.5 centimeters (3.1 feet). Once unfolded, the right wing was higher on the fuselage than the left, a result of the packaging scheme. The WASP drone had a flight endurance of fifteen minutes, including ten minutes of powered flight and five minutes of glide. It had a tiny camera in its lower fuselage, and relayed both imagery and its own current GPS coordinates back to the warship or artillery battery that fired it. At least two WASP prototypes were built and tested. After initial announcements of the effort, the whole thing went quiet, but it remains a possibility. =\\"Wing-store UAV\\" and Raytheon \\"SilentEyes\\"= The Army had also worked on a UAV that could be launched out of a 70 millimeter (2.75 inch) unguided rocket pod mounted on a helicopter and could also be carried by larger UAVs. This wing-store UAV was 1.8 meters (6 ft) long, and was fired out of the launch tube with a solid-rocket booster. It then deployed wings, tail, and propeller, and cruised for up to two hours on electric power at a speed of 185 km/h (100 knots). It could carry a small daylight or infrared camera. Details of the wing-store UAV are unclear, but it may have had some resemblance to the Raytheon SilentEyes UAV. SilentEyes looked like a simple metal cylinder with a rounded cap, straight folding wings mounted in the middle of the UAV and with a noticeable dihedral, and a folding inverted- vee tail. The UAV was 46 centimeters (18 inches) long and less than 7 centimeters (2.75 inches) in diameter. Raytheon called SilentEyes a \\"parasite\\" UAV, as it would be dispensed from a larger UAV such as a Predator; a gliding submunitions dispenser; or a cruise missile. The baseline version of the SilentEyes would be strictly a glider, but its glide ratio of 11:1 would allow it to stay in the air for a half-hour if released from typical Predator operational altitudes. It would be used for close-up examination of targets spotted by SAR to ensure that they are valid targets, or for post-strike target damage assessment. The little UAV could carry a gimbaled infrared or color TV camera, with the video compressed for transmission by a UHF communications link over line-of-sight ranges. It could also carry a jammer payload, or a small warhead. Since multiple SilentEyes would be deployed at the same time, each could be assigned a different code or \\"telephone number\\" to minimize confusion in communications. Raytheon was aiming for a target price of about US$5,000 to $10,000. The company was considering a powered version of SilentEyes with a microjet engine, as well as \\"stretched\\" versions of the UAV. The SilentEyes has been cancelled.http://www.deagel.com/Tactical- Unmanned-Air-Vehicles/SilentEyes_a000177001.aspx =Italian \\"MALP\\"= Galileo Avionica of Italy is currently working on their own \\"parasite\\" UAV, called simply the Miniature Air Launched Payload (MALP), to be carried on a Falco or similar UAV. The MALP has large cruciform tailfins, small cruciform nosefins, and \\"switchblade\\" wings stowed back along the fuselage that pop out straight when the UAV is released. It is intended to carry imaging or other sensors to probe dangerous targets.  Man-portable UAVs  There is a great deal of activity in the small UAV field, with a number of systems now being acquired and some being used in combat. = AeroVironment \\"Pointer\\" and \\"Raven\\" = A soldier assembles a RQ-11 Raven in preparation for launch In 1999, the US Army bought four AeroVironment Pointer small UAVs for testing in the service's \\"Military Operations In Urban Terrain\\" and was enthusiastic about the usefulness of the Pointer. It is too large to be conveniently carried by soldiers and is normally hauled around in a HMMWV(Humvee) vehicle or the like, and so the Army asked AeroVironment to develop a smaller version. AeroVironment developed a half-sized control system and a cut-down version of the Pointer called the RQ-11 Raven (no relationship to the Flight Refueling Raven). The Raven has an endurance of 90 minutes on rechargeable batteries. It can be carried by a single soldier along with other standard battle gear. Following the Afghanistan campaign in 2001–2002, the US SOCOM ordered 80 Ravens, which was more than the total number of Pointers that had been sold to that time. The US Army also placed orders for up to 105 Ravens in the late summer of 2003 after the US occupation of Iraq led to persistent insurgent attacks on US forces. Since then, the RQ-11B Raven B has become the official standard SUAS (Small Unmanned Aircraft System) for USSOCOM, US Army, US Marines, and several countries. As of early 2008, over 8000 Raven airframes have been shipped to customers worldwide. Ravens have been operational in combat in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other undisclosed locations. Encouraged by such successes, AeroVironment is also working on a newer version of the Pointer, named the \\"Puma\\", with greater endurance and payload. In addition, they have disclosed that they are in late development of a small lethal UAV. =AeroVironment \\"Switchblade\\"= In September 2011, it was reported that the US Army had signed a contract with AeroVironment for the supply of the Switchblade miniature drone. Switchblade is the first tactical armed drone for use by a soldier as part of their backpack kit and weighs around 2.5 kg. The mini-drone has a small warhead and is launched from a 60 cm long container/launcher tube. As it launches its small wings unfold and can be guided to its target via a nose-mounted camera. The operator looks through a viewer that displays video from the drone. Switchblade can also be directed to coordinates using Global Positioning System (GPS). Powered by an electric motor it can reach speeds up to 80 km/h and loiter for up to 40 minutes. The US Army put the Switchblade into operation in June 2012. Reports of the range of the version used by the Army vary however, with reported ranges including 5+ kilometers, 12 kilometers and 40 kilometers. =Interspect UAS B 3.1 \\"Flying Lab\\"= Interspect UAS B 3.1 Flying Laboratory The Interspect UAS B 3.1 is a remote sensing platform for 3D photogrammetric purposes. The Interspect UAS B 1.1 octocopter first flew on 10 April 2011. The prototype had one DSLR camera and limited capability. The third variant able to fly 12 min with 3 kg loading. Interspect UAS B 3.1 have a removable 3D photogrammetry camera with humidity meter and other instruments. The octocopter's diameter is 1165 mm. =Aeryon Labs \\"Scout\\"= Aeryon Scout micro VTOL UAV The Aeryon Scout is a man-packable quadcopter UAV designed for aerial reconnaissance by users with minimal training. Weighing just 1.3 kg, it features onboard intelligence, all-digital communications and a map-based touch-screen control which enables new users to operate the vehicles with only minutes of training. This map-based control allows the system to be easily controlled beyond line- of-sight and at night, a unique feature of this system. Its unique modular design allows for quick-connect payloads of different types and its arms and legs are changeable in the field, with no tools. This allows the user to repair damages easily and return to operation quickly. The Scout is approximately 0.8 m from propeller tip to tip and operates using four brushless DC motors, making it very quiet. It has an endurance of approximately 20 minutes. It is capable of flying in winds up to 50 km/h and designed for all-weather operation, with an industrial temperature range. It has a payload capability of approximately 250 grams. It has been designed for both military and civilian use, with specific focus to remain dual-use compliant. =Aeryon Labs \\"SkyRanger\\"= The Aeryon SkyRanger builds on the capabilities of the Aeryon Scout and is a man-packable quadcopter UAV designed for aerial reconnaissance by users with minimal training. About 1 kg heavier than the Aeryon Scout at 2.5 kg, the Aeryon SkyRanger shares the map-based control interface. The SkyRanger is capable of longer duration flight, and can fly up to 50 minutes with a dual EO/IR payload. The SkyRanger has a higher bitrate, IP-based network and is capable of streaming HD video from over 5 km, with multicasting capabilities. The vehicle is all-weather capable, with an industrial temperature range and has a top speed of 65 km/h. It is able to withstand windgusts up to 90 km/h. The Aeryon SkyRanger has a folding design that makes it quickly deployable. = Applied Aeronautics \\"Albatross UAV\\" = The Albatross looks a bit like the military RQ-7 Shadow drone but can be purchased for less than US$2,000. Several options are available. In 2018, the Albatross UAV was shown at the signing of a partnership between Boeing's Insitu and the Queensland Government. It has since been used extensively in Australia. = Aurora Flight Sciences Skate SUAS = The Skate SUAS is a man portable unmanned system designed for the tactical user (military, police etc.) but also useful for other applications where portability and operation from constrained environments are critical. It is a 2.2 lb airframe coupled with a custom portable GCS. It has user swappable payloads and can be equipped with a variety of EO, IR and/or thermal imagers. Flight endurance is around 1hr. The Skate SUAS was put into service with Army and Air Force units in Afghanistan in March 2013. =China \\"CATIC\\"= CATIC of China is working on their own hand-launched man-portable UAV, the \\"ASN-15\\", with an endurance of an hour and a payload of 6.5 kilograms (14.3 pounds). =EADS \\"Tracker\\"= European EADS organization is developing a small UAV named the Tracker, which features a wide-span wing, twin booms for payload and so on, and a central pod with tractor and puller propellers. It has a weight of 7.5 kilograms (16.5 pounds), a span of 1.4 meters (4 feet 7 inches), and an endurance of an hour. =Elbit \\"Skylark I\\" and \\"Seagull\\"= In the spring of 2003 Elbit of Israel introduced two electrically powered man-portable UAVs, the Skylark and the Seagull. Both of these UAVs have a launch weight of about 5.5 kilograms (12 pounds), a speed of from 35 to 70 km/h (20 to 40 knots), and can carry either a color daylight imager or an infrared imager. The Skylark I is of conventional configuration, resembling nothing so much as a large kid's rubber-band airplane with a pod under the fuselage. It has an endurance of 1.5 hours. The Seagull is much less conventional, in the form of a boomerang- shaped flying wing with wingtip fins and a pusher propeller. Size, performance, and payload details of the Seagull are similar to those of the Skylark, but the endurance is stretched to six hours. =EMT \\"Aladin\\"= EMT Aladin German manufacturer EMT has produced the Aladin Mini-UAV for German forces. It has a range of more than 15 km and an endurance of 30–60 minutes. =IAI Malat \\"BirdEye\\"s and \\"Mosquito\\"= IAI Malat has also introduced their own small UAV line, designated BirdEye, which includes the 5 kilogram (11 pound) BirdEye 500 and the 500 gram (1.1 pound) BirdEye 100. Sources also mention a Malat micro-UAV, the Mosquito, though this may be the same as the BirdEye 100. Malat has been promoting the BirdEye 500 for both military and civilian uses, with civilian uses including urban security, crime-fighting, and traffic observation. = Lehmann Aviation drones = Lehmann Aviation LM450 UAS Lehmann Aviation Ltd, the French manufacturer, has developed man- portable (92 cm wingspan) lightweight (1,25 kg) line of UAVs: LP960 (2007), LV580 (2009), LM450 (2010) – with a common Ground Control System. All the UAVs are designed for civil applications (civil reconnaissance, civil security, mapping, survey and monitoring, digital elevation model, photography in general etc.) and can make still aerial images and full HD or real-time videos. Lehmann Aviation drones are launched by hand and land independently on the ground. The systems use electric engine and a pushing propeller on the back part of the aircraft. The wing is made of expanded polypropylene. The UAS have an advanced navigation system and an autopilot which enable the aircraft to fly with the range of 5 km and a flight endurance from 30 to 45 minutes. Lehmann Aviation UAVs were designed to fly with up to 45 km/h wind (25 kn), in different climate conditions (humidity, dry air), with the temperature range from −25 °C to +60 °C. Lehmann Aviation LP960 is a UAV for professional use launched in 2007. LP960 was designed for orthomosaics (Digital Elevation Model) and HD vertical images for the needs of public and private sectors (mostly construction and geodesy companies as well as scientific organisations). Lehmann Aviation LV580 is UAV done for professional use. It was launched in 2009 for live day and night aerial survey. Lehmann Aviation LM450 is a UAV for professional use launched in 2010. It was designed to take oblique still images and HD videos. In 2012 Lehmann Aviation launched L-A series of fully automatic micro civil UAVs: The LA100, LA200 and LA300. The work with Windows 8 touchscreen tablet which enables user to set up flight parameters and prepare the mission. All Lehmann Aviation drones are compatible with Lehmann Aviation OperationCenter v2.00 working under Windows 8 operating system. =Lockheed Martin \\"Desert Hawk\\"= US forces are also using another mini-UAV in Iraq, the Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk. It weighs 3.2 kilograms (7 pounds), has a wingspan of 1.32 meters (52 inches) and a length of 86.4 centimeters (34 inches). It is made mostly of plastic foam, suggesting something like a Nerf toy, and uses an electric motor driving a pusher propeller as a powerplant, making it very quiet. It is launched with a bungee cord, carries three small CCD cameras, has an endurance of about an hour. It flies mostly under autonomous control, with the \\"pilot\\" keeping track of what's going on with a laptop computer. The Desert Hawk was designed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works for the Air Force FPASS (Force Protection Airborne Surveillance System) Program on a quick-reaction contract issued late in the winter of 2002, with the first system delivered in the early summer. It was designed quickly because it leveraged heavily off of technology and design studies developed for the MicroStar MAVs. However, in 2007, the US Air Force FPASS office switched all of their UAV systems over to the RQ-11 Raven B.https://web.archive.org/web/20071029160853/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071292 Desert Hawk did make the short-list for the recent Netherlands Army Mini-UAV program, but ultimately lost to the RQ-11B Raven B. The only military forces still using Desert Hawk are the UK Army. =Honeywell RQ-16 T-Hawk= Honeywell RQ-16A T-Hawk. The Honeywell RQ-16 T-Hawk (for \\"Tarantula hawk\\", a wasp species) is a ducted fan VTOL miniature UAV. Developed by Honeywell, it is suitable for backpack deployment and single-person operation. =MAVinci \\"SIRIUS UAS\\"= The SIRIUS UAS is a completely autonomous small airplane with a wingspan of two meters.\\"http://www.mavinci.eu\\" MAVinci – Unmanned Aerial Systems The UAV combined with the image post processing software enables one to simply obtain aerial images and calculate orthofotos and three dimensional elevation models out of the image data. The flight planning is done automatically after selecting the aerial image area. The flightplan can be altered before and during the flight. No catapult or launching device is necessary because the UAV is hand-launched. During the flight aerial images are recorded automatically. Manual control during the flight in case of emergencies is possible with assisted flight mode supported by the autopilot. In this mode landing is also possible on very small areas. Autonomous landing is also available. =NRL \\"Dragon Eye\\", \\"Swallow\\" and \\"Finder\\"= The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has developed a man-portable UAV of roughly the same size as the AeroVironment Raven, named the RQ-14 Dragon Eye (no relationship to the BAI Aerosystems Dragon). The Dragon Eye is a tailless design with a rectangular wing and twin props. It is designed to fit into a backpack, with a weight of 2.25 kilograms (5 pounds) and a span of 1.14 meters (3 feet 9 inches). It can be launched by hand or bungee slingshot and has a GPS-INS- based waypoint navigation system. One of the features is that the operator monitors Dragon Eye operation through \\"video goggles\\" connected to a laptop computer. The control system weighs about 5.4 kilograms (12 pounds). The Dragon Eye's endurance is an hour. The production contract for Dragon Eye was awarded to AeroVironment in 2003, and over 1000 aircraft were built before the Marines switched over to the RQ-11B Raven B for the remainder of the Dragon Eye production contract. The NRL has also built at least two other small UAVs. The Swallow is of more conventional configuration than the Dragon Eye, roughly comparable to the AeroVironment Pointer, with long sailplane wings and a tail- mounted propeller. Details are unclear, but it has been used in NRL experiments to develop anti-sniper sensors for base security applications. The Finder (Flight Inserted Detector Expandable for Reconnaissance), with a weight of 26 kilograms (57 pounds), can carry a small imager, or an atmospheric sampling sensor to check for radiological / chemical / biological contaminants, and other sensor payloads are being considered. Other details of the Finder are unclear. The Finder has been evaluated as a payload for the Predator UAV, with one Finder carried under each wing, acting as a parasite UAV like the Raytheon SilentEyes. Initial flight tests of the Finder with the Predator were performed in the summer of 2002. =Rafael \\"SkyLite\\"= Rafael of Israel has built a man-portable UAV also named the SkyLite, which is fired out of a tube like an antitank missile, and has an endurance of about an hour. It can be launched from a vehicle mount or shoulder-launched by a soldier. Skylite B is the newest version, and is rail-launched. In October 2008, Rafael announced that a SkyLite B had achieved an altitude of 36,000 feet (11,000 m).Aviation Week & Space Technology Vol. 169 No. 16, 27 October 2008, \\"High Flight\\", p. 26 The SkyLite has a certain general resemblance to the Raytheon SilentEyes, being a tube a 110 centimeters (3 feet 7 inches) long with a glass sensor nose; a pusher propeller powered by an electric motor; pop-out straight wings with a span of 150 centimeters (4 feet 11 inches); and a cruciform pop- out tail. It has a launch weight of 6 kilograms (13.2 pounds). It was originally named \\"Skylark\\" but Rafael decided to change the name to avoid confusion with the Elbit Skylark. =Russian UAV ZALA 421-08 and ZALA 421-12= ZALA 421-08 developed by A-Level Aerosystems, Izhevsk, Russia is a flying wing UAV featuring a weight of 1.7 kg and a wing span of mere 0.8 m. The payload consists of color forward-looking and side-looking cameras. The plug-in cameras module can be easily replaced with the infrared camera. Its range is 15 km, maximum flight duration is 90 minutes. ZALA 421-08 is powered by an electric motor. The UAV is launched by hand and landed on a 30×100m ground using parachute. Small sizes make it indispensable in urban areas and busy air spaces. Being operated by all power ministries of Russia, ZALA 421-08 has proved itself as an extremely useful surveillance tool when capturing the terrorists and smugglers. ZALA 421-12 is a flying wing UAV specially designed by A-Level Aerosystems, Izhevsk, Russia for Federal Security Service. It features a weight of approximately 4 kg and a wingspan of 1.6 m. The UAV carries EO equipment weighing up to 1 kg which may include gyro-stabilized down-looking video camera, 10 MPix photo camera or infrared camera. The UAV is powered by electric motor driving a small propeller in the nose, with rechargeable batteries permitting an hour of continuous flight at the range of 40 km. Its takeoff and landing is performed in fully automatic mode. The range of application is rather wide, including monitoring of emergencies and natural disasters, remote monitoring of fuel and energy complex, patrolling of land and sea borders, industrial and environmental monitoring, and protection of security-critical facilities. =ShadowView \\"Shadow Ranger\\" and \\"Eco Ranger\\"= ShadowView Eco Ranger ShadowView a United Kingdom UAS services provider founded in 2012, has designed and built an all new range of man- portable UAVs which are called Shadow Ranger and Eco Ranger.

The Manta, 1.2m wingspan flying wing is used for vertical NVIR imaging. =Trigger Composites Pteryx UAV= Pteryx UAV for civilian photomapping In 2010, the company introduced a novel UAV that can fly diverse pre-programmed missions using only the simplest mission selector and a single takeoff button. The UAV features automatic takeoff and parachute landing, allowing reduction of workload and reducing configuration mistakes, identified as a major hazard in day-to-day civilian photomapping operations. No groundstation nor laptop is required as missions are defined relative to takeoff position. Despite featuring parachute, a sturdy fuselage, under 5 kg TOW and up to 1 kg payload, the UAV can fly one-hour missions (two hours with reduced payload).

(content from AllRovi) Career Ewell was born in Williamston, North Carolina to teenage parents. His father fought in Vietnam and served six years in the United States military while Dwight's mother took care of Dwight and his younger sister. Unhappy in her marriage, at 21 years old, Dwight's mom took the children up North where she felt that she could begin pursuing her career as a singer. The three moved several times before ending up in the rough Stella Wright Housing Projects on Prince Street, in Newark, New Jersey. Dwight and his sister attended the Louise A. Spencer Elementary School in Newark in the mid-1970s. In later years, Dwight was enrolled in The Gifted and Talented Program in the same school. It was there that his interest in the arts was nurtured. At the age of 9, he began writing plays that the teachers would allow him to direct and the students to perform. At the age of 13, Ewell auditioned for and was accepted into Arts High School in Newark, New Jersey. In 1986, he graduated, and in the fall of that year he attended the State University of New York's Theater Arts and Film Divisions Acting Program for four years. Ewell has worked extensively in independent and art house films. Ewell is best known for his performance in Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy starring Ben Affleck, where he plays the role of \\"Hooper X\\", an African American writer of black militant comic books, who is secretly homosexual but employs the public persona of a violent militant who denounces the Star Wars trilogy as racist. Ewell has collaborated with director Hal Hartley on short- and feature-length films; including Amateur and Flirt. He has also worked with director Daisy von Scherler Mayer twice, in the films Party Girl and The Guru. Ewell has worked with film producer Christine Vachon twice, on the films Stonewall and Kiss Me, Guido. Filmography { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! Genre !! width=\\"35\\"  Year !! Title !! Role !

In the list below, battle honours in small capitals were awarded for participation in large operations and campaigns, while those in lowercase indicate honours granted for more specific battles. Battle honours in bold type are emblazoned on the regimental colour. History =Formation= As early as 1905 the local Scottish community in Winnipeg, led by the St Andrew's Society, began lobbying the government to raise a Highland regiment. Under increasing pressure from the Scottish lobbyists the government relented and the initial steps taken to form Western Canada's first Highland regiment. On 29 September 1909, the prospective officers met and committees dealing with finances, uniforms and the band were formed. As the government grant did not cover the entire cost of uniforms and equipment, the Scottish societies and the officers undertook to raise the money themselves managing an initial amount of $25,000.00. Almost all of the original accoutrements were manufactured in Scotland, obtained from William Anderson & Sons Ltd. On 1 February 1910, the 79th Cameron Highlanders of Canada were officially gazetted, headquartered in the former Dominion Lands Office at 202 Main Street. On 9 October 1910, the regiment received its first stand of Colours, presented by Mrs D. C. Cameron, wife of the honorary lieutenant-colonel. The availability of the number \\"79\\" was fortuitous and enabled the new Canadian regiment to adopt the regimental number of a famous regiment in Scotland, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders who had been raised in 1793 as the 79th (Cameron Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. Along with the regimental number the new Canadian regiment chose to also perpetuate the uniform of the Imperial Camerons.Imperial Camerons This association with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders became official on 31 January 1911, when His Majesty, King George V authorized the alliance of the two Highland regiments. On 22 June 1911, a contingent of 61 Camerons, parading with their allied regiment, participated in the coronation of King George V. =The Great War= When the First World War broke out the Canadian Army did not mobilize based on its existing structure. Instead Sir Sam Hughes, the Minister of Militia created an entirely new table of organization with numbered battalions raised on geographical lines. This often meant that more than one militia regiment contributed men to a single new Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) Battalion. Under this mobilization plan militia regiments were to remain in Canada acting only as drafting units. Initially the Camerons were tasked with raising a company. The First Volunteer Overseas Company mobilized 7 officers and 250 other ranks under Captain John Geddes. This company mustered at Camp Valcartier to be formed into a battalion with companies from three other Canadian highland regiments, the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF. The Camerons next mobilized the Second Volunteer Overseas Company providing the second-in-command, Major D. S. MacKay, a company (10 officers, 250 other ranks) and a signals section for what would become the 27th (City of Winnipeg) Battalion (The Royal Winnipeg Rifles). It would not be until December 1914 that the regiment would be permitted to raise an entire battalion for overseas service. On 18 December 1914, the Camerons received authority to raise a complete battalion for overseas service and the Volunteer Overseas Battalion was gazetted and mobilization commenced under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert M. Thomson. The battalion began training at Minto Armoury in Winnipeg and was soon re-designated the 43rd Battalion (Cameron Highlanders of Canada), CEF. On 29 May 1915 the battalion entrained for Montreal and deployment overseas. Embarking on HMTS Grampian on 9 June with a complement of 39 officers and 1,020 other ranks, the 43rd arrived in England on 8 June, disembarking at Davenport and proceeding by train to Lower St Martin's Plain, Shorncliffe. Arriving at the camp to find nothing ready for them, the Camerons set about pitching tents and setting up camp. The battalion made camp so expertly that they continued to be tasked to prepare camp for newly arriving units. On 22 July the 43rd supplied a reinforcement draft of 386 other ranks to the 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion, the first of several. This loss of manpower placed the 43rd in peril of being broken up entirely and used as reinforcements. On 28 September the 43rd moved from the tented camp into huts at East Sandling. On 23 November the battalion was made into a reserve battalion and began taking casualties from the 15th and 16th Battalions on strength. Reinforced with the arrival of a number of drafts from the 79th Cameron Highlanders of Canada Drafting Detachment back in Winnipeg, the 43rd was brought back up to strength and reprieved from dissolution, ceasing to be a reserve Battalion on 24 January 1916. The casualties on its strength were transferred to the 17th Reserve battalion, and on 29 January, the 43rd entrained for Liphook, Bramshott Camp to join the 3rd Canadian Division. Awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his actions at Sanctuary Wood in 1916 as a sergeant, Robert Shankland received a battlefield commission and continued to serve with the 43rd Battalion as an officer. On the morning of 26 October, he led his platoon of 40 men from \\"D\\" Company to the crest of the hill at the Bellevue Spur, the main trench line defending Passchendaele. Overrunning it and holding the position was critical to capturing the town. Although both flanks were eventually exposed, they held the position, withstanding incessant artillery shelling, German counterattacks and sustaining frightful casualties. In danger of being cut off and losing the vital position, Shankland turned over his command to another officer, and then returned to battalion headquarters, where he gave a first-hand report of the situation. He also offered a detailed plan on how a counterattack with reinforcements could best be achieved. He then returned to his men to lead the forthcoming attack supported by reinforcements from the 52nd and 58th Battalions. For his actions that day Robert Shankland was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 12 January 1916, the 174th (Cameron Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, CEF was authorized and gazetted. As the regiment was focussed on raising the 179th Battalion the raising of the 174th was put aside until 30 May, when the battalion was organized with Lieutenant-Colonel James A. Cantlie in command. The 174th trained at Camp Hughes through the summer of 1917 and on 20 August, Lieutenant-Colonel Cantlie handed command over to Lieutenant- Colonel Hugh F. Osler, who had returned from serving with the 43rd Battalion in France. On 22 April, the battalion entrained at Winnipeg for overseas deployment and seven days later embarked on HMTS Olympic at Halifax for the Atlantic crossing. The 174th arrived at Liverpool on 7 May, where the battalion disembarked and proceeded by train to Upper Dibgate Camp. Upon arrival the 174th was absorbed into the 14th Reserve Battalion (formerly the 179th Battalion), and the men ultimately sent as reinforcement drafts for the 16th and 43rd Battalions serving with the Canadian Corps in France. On 12 January 1916, the 179th (Cameron Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, CEF was authorized and gazetted under command of Lieutenant-Colonel James A. Cantlie. The nucleus of the 179th was formed from absorbing the 79th Cameron Highlanders of Canada Drafting Detachment on 1 February. On 30 May, Lieutenant-Colonel Cantlie, whose poor health precluded him from overseas deployment, relinquished command to Lieutenant-Colonel J. Y. Reid, and the battalion moved by train to Camp Hughes. Training at Camp Hughes throughout the summer of 1916, the 179th entrained for overseas deployment on 26 September. Arriving in Halifax, the battalion embarked on HMTS Saxonia on 4 October, and set sail for England. The 179th battalion arrived at Liverpool on 13 October, where they disembarked and proceeded to East Sanding Camp. On 4 January 1917, the 179th was re-designated the 14th Reserve Battalion and moved to Upper Dibgate Camp. =Between the wars= In 1920 a major reorganization of Canadian Militia units took place. Some units were disbanded, others were re-rolled or amalgamated and almost all numerical designations were dropped from regimental titles (the two notable exceptions being the 48th Highlanders of Canada and the Royal 22e Régiment). Thus the 79th Cameron Highlanders of Canada became simply, the Cameron Highlanders of Canada. In order to perpetuate the regiment's accomplishments during the First World War, the regiment was reorganized as three battalions: the 1st Battalion \\"43rd Battalion CEF\\", 2nd (Reserve) Battalion (174th Battalion CEF) and 3rd (Reserve) Battalion (179th Battalion CEF). In reality the 1st Battalion was the only active militia unit. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions were reserve units where non-active personnel could transfer for an interim period or upon retirement and remain subject to future recall. The popularity of Highland Regiments was at an all-time high in Canada after the First World War and a number of line infantry units chose to adopt Highland dress and customs. In 1920 The Ottawa Regiment (The Duke of Cornwall's Own) converted to a Highland Regiment adopting the title of The Ottawa Highlanders and the uniform of the Camerons. Steps were taken to form an alliance with the new Cameron Regiment in Ottawa and the alliance was formally granted in 1923. Subsequently, in 1933 The Ottawa Highlanders changed their name to The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa. On 24 October 1923, his Majesty King George V was \\"graciously pleased\\" to grant permission for the regiment to be named the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada in recognition of the Regiment's exemplary service during the First World War. With granting of the royal designation \\"Queen's Own\\" the regiment decided to adopt badges that more closely resembled the pattern worn by the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of the British Army. The new cap badge depicted the figure of Saint Andrew holding in his arms a saltire (Saint Andrew's Cross), enclosed by a wreath of thistles and leaves and across the lower part of the wreath, scrolls inscribed: QUEEN'S OWN CAMERON HIGHLANDERS OF CANADA. New collar and sporran badges of a pattern identical to the Imperial Camerons were also chosen. The new pattern badges were authorized by the War Office on 31 August 1925, and the cap and collar badges received by the regiment on 24 February 1927. The new pattern badges were held in stores pending the acquisition of the new sporran badge. With the sporran badges still yet to be acquired, the collar badges were finally issued in January 1930, and the cap badges towards the end of the year. =Second World War= On 1 September 1939, the Camerons were officially notified of the impending war. Within 17 days of being ordered to mobilize, the battalion was at full strength of 807 all ranks. This time the Camerons would not fight in their kilts as the regiment had 25 years earlier. A War Department directive issued in April 1940 made battledress the standard uniform for all units and the Highland regiments reluctantly surrendered their kilts for trousers. The regiment was increased to two battalions, the 1st Battalion being placed on active duty for overseas service as part of the 2nd Canadian Division and the 2nd Battalion to remain in Winnipeg to recruit and train replacements. On 16 December 1940, the 1st Battalion embarked for overseas on board the SS Louis Pasteur, arriving at Gourock, Scotland on Christmas Eve. On 19 August 1942, the Camerons landed in occupied Europe as part of Operation Jubilee, the raid on the French port of Dieppe. The South Saskatchewan Regiment were to land in the first wave of the attack on Green Beach to secure the beach at Pourville, the right flank of the operation. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada would then land in the second wave and move inland along the eastern bank of the Scie River to meet up with the tanks of The King's Own Calgary Regiment coming from Dieppe and capture the airfield at Saint-Aubin-sur-Scie. The Camerons and the Calgary tanks would then clear the Hitler Battery and attack the suspected German divisional headquarters at Arques-la-Bataille. The attack went in on time (0450 hours) but the South Saskatchewan Regiment did not land astride the river as intended, but to the west of it. This didn't pose a problem for the force aiming to clear the village and attack the cliffs to the west, but for the other force it meant they had to move through the village, cross the exposed bridge over the river before attempting to get on the high ground to the east. The delay this imposed meant that the Germans had time to react and deploy. \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" Companies of the South Saskatchewan Regiment took all their objectives, including a large white house on the western headland that proved to be some kind of officers quarters. The other two companies found that the bridge was swept by fire from a number of German pillboxes on the high ground facing them and the attack stalled as Canadian casualties mounted. As the Camerons were the second wave to attack on Green Beach they came into an aroused German defence. The Camerons were riding in plywood landing craft. About off Green Beach, the craft formed in a single line and moved toward the beach. The German shore batteries, machine guns, and mortars opened fire. Above the angry roar of battle and the growl of racing engines came a sound that riveted the attention of U. S. Ranger Sergeant Marcell G. Swank. On a small forward deck of the landing craft to Swank's right, Pipe Major Alex GrahamCommemorative Medal stood courageously playing A Hundred Pipers. \\"He stood there,\\" recalled Swank, \\"defiantly telling the world that the Camerons were coming. God what a glory.\\" Inspired by their piper, the Camerons landed on Green Beach with courage and élan and swept forward. This is the last recorded instance of Canadian troops being piped into battle. The Camerons hit the Green Beach an hour after the South Saskatchewan Regiment, some 30 minutes late, as the commanding officer had not believed that the South Saskatchewan Regiment would be able to clear the beach and village in the allotted time. As they landed the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Gostling, was killed by a sniper and the unit was taken over by the second-in-command, Major A. T. \\"Andy\\" Law. The majority of the force was mistakenly landed to the west of the river, so Law decided to alter the plan. Those that had landed to the east were told to join the South Saskatchewan Regiment, while the majority to the west advanced up the valley with Major Law. They were harassed on their journey by fire from Quatre Vents Farm and decided to seek shelter in the woods, through which, they reached the high ground above Bas d'Hautot. There they saw that the enemy already held the bridge at Petite Appeville in some strength (by a heavily reinforced anti-tank company from the 571st Infantry Regiment). Law's group could not now realistically take the bridge, nor could they bypass it, for the road from Ouville was now swarming with enemy reinforcements. Meanwhile, the rest of the Camerons had joined up with the South Saskatchewan Regiment but despite closing in on Quatre Vents Farm and the radar station they were halted by enemy fire. Although the Camerons made the deepest penetration of the day, the main landing at Dieppe had been unsuccessful. By 0930 hours a decision had to be made. The failure of the tanks to arrive had made it impossible for the Camerons to gain their objectives and suggested things were not going quite as planned on the main beaches. Faced with increasing German opposition and a complete lack of communication with higher headquarters, the Camerons began to fight their way back to Pourville, carrying their wounded. With Support Platoon leading, \\"A\\" Company guarding the flank and \\"C\\" Company forming the rearguard, the battalion made it back to Beronville Wood and re-established contact with the South Saskatchewan Regiment. It was only then that they found out the landing craft would not return for re-embarkation until 1100 hours. Major Law and Lieutenant-Colonel Merritt (Commanding Officer of the South Saskatchewan Regiment) set up a combined headquarters in the Grand Central Hotel, and prepared their battalions to stand and fight for a full hour against a rapidly increasing enemy, who had their line of withdrawal (the beach) enfiladed with fire from innumerable guns. The Camerons fought desperately to keep their foothold on the high ground to the west, while the South Saskatchewan Regiment grimly held on to a piece of high ground to the east. Slowly the Germans collapsed the pocket smaller and smaller, until they dominated the entire beach and the slopes east of Pourville. By this time, few of the Camerons and South Saskatchewan Regiment were unwounded. At 1100 hours the landing craft began to arrive, taking grievous losses on the approach into the beach. More men were killed and wounded as they tried to board the landing craft under the enemy's withering fire. Almost miraculously five landing craft and one tank landing craft managed to rescue men from the shallows and cleared the beach with full loads. By 1130 hours the situation had become impossible and no further extractions were attempted. Of 503 Camerons on the raid, 346 were casualties: 60 killed in action; 8 died of wounds after evacuation; 167 prisoners of war (8 of whom died of wounds). Of the 268 returning to England, 103 were wounded. 25 Camerons were decorated for their actions at Dieppe. The regiment received two Distinguished Service Orders (the second highest award for bravery for officers after the Victoria Cross), two Military Crosses, three Distinguished Conduct Medals (the second highest award for bravery for non-commissioned members after the Victoria Cross), four Military Medals, thirteen Mentions in Dispatches and a Croix de guerre with bronze palms. One of the Distinguished Service Order recipients was the acting commanding officer, Major Law. On 7 July 1944, the battalion was back in France, landing at Graye-sur-Mer, Calvados as part of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. On the evening of 11 July, the unit moved to the vicinity of Rots and then relieved the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada at Carpiquet the next day. The next six days the battalion spent digging in to avoid enemy shelling and patrolling to root out enemy snipers and remnants. On 19 July, the battalion left Carpiquet for an assembly area across the Orne River in preparation for the start of Operation Atlantic the next day. On the way to the start line, the battalion suffered casualties from enemy artillery and mortar fire. The Camerons launched their attack from Fleury-sur-Orne, supported by artillery and Typhoon squadrons. \\"A\\" Company advanced on the right with \\"B\\" Company left, \\"C\\" Company in depth and \\"D\\" Company in reserve. No tanks accompanied the attacking infantry but a squadron of tanks from The Sherbrooke Fusiliers was allotted to the Camerons for counter-attack. The attack did not start well. The Officer Commanding Headquarters Company, Captain H. Grundy and the Intelligence Officer, Lieutenant J. Maloney were both killed when an enemy 88 mm gun hit the scout car. The Battalion War Diary for June was lost with the vehicle. The loss of this command vehicle would hamper the Battalion's radio communications throughout the battle. \\"A\\" Company was held up from the start line, coming under intense machine gun fire. Suppressing the enemy machine gunners with artillery and medium machine gun fire from The Toronto Scottish Regiment, \\"A\\" Company was able to carry on. \\"B\\" Company encountered mild resistance and reached its objective advancing through the sniper, mortar and machine gun fire. As \\"A\\" Company had ended up somewhat to the right of their objective \\"C\\" Company was pushed through to fill the gap between \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". \\"C\\" Company met no resistance until it reached the south end of the village. \\"D\\" Company moved up to secure the rear of the battalion position. The enemy still held part of Hill 112 and continued to subject the Camerons to very heavy fire from west of the Orne. Heavy rain interfered with radio communications that were already affected by the loss of the scout car. With three companies forward, the Camerons held a wide frontage, so the commanding officer ordered \\"C\\" and \\"B\\" Companies to withdraw slightly to draw in the perimeter. \\"B\\" Company was shifting their positions when the Germans counter-attacked. The company managed to consolidate in their new position, but sustained significant casualties. As a result, the commanding officer moved \\"D\\" Company up to replace them, and moved \\"B\\" back as Battalion reserve. Elements of the I SS Panzer Corps counter-attacked along the entire Battalion front, with especially heavy concentrations of infantry thrown against \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" Companies. Towards dusk a heavy counter-attack supported by eight Panzerkampfwagen V (Panther) tanks was launched against \\"D\\" Company. Three of the Cameron anti-tank guns were knocked out, but the Camerons destroyed two of the panzers with PIATs (Projector Infantry Anti- Tank). \\"D\\" Company was overrun and forced to withdraw to link up with the remains of \\"B\\" Company. Overnight on 20–21 July \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies beat back repeated counter-attacks. At times the opposing forces were within shouting distance of each other. In the morning, further counter-attacks by small groups of tanks were fought off on the left flank in \\"C\\" Company's area. 10 Platoon of \\"B\\" Company was entirely cut off from the rest of the battalion as the battle raged around the perimeter of the orchard. A company of German infantry, that had infiltrated across the river overnight, launched a series of small attacks against the Battalion Headquarters, which were beaten off with many prisoners being taken by \\"A\\" Company and the Scout Platoon. The Germans continued to counter-attack on 22 July, but their strength was reduced. Attacks by two or three tanks supported by small groups of infantry were beaten off throughout the day. At one point \\"A\\" Company was forced to withdraw, but with the assistance of heavy artillery support, counter-attacked and regained their positions. 11 Platoon was sent from \\"B\\" Company to reinforce \\"C\\" Company in driving off an enemy attack and remained under command of \\"C\\" Company, taking up defensive positions on the left flank. In between counter-attacks the Germans subjected the Cameron positions to heavy shelling with artillery, mortars and Nebelwerfers (rockets). By 23 July the counter-attacks had dwindled to minor infiltrations that were easily handled and the Germans resorted to increased shelling. \\"C\\" Company was so reduced by this time that the remainder of 10 Platoon was sent from \\"B\\" Company to reinforce it. The Camerons suffered heavy casualties in the fighting for Saint-André-sur-Orne: 52 wounded (including the commanding officer and the officer commanding \\"B\\" Company) and 29 killed. Company Sergeant Major Sutherland and Private G. T. Munroe were each awarded the Military Medal for their actions at Saint-André-sur-Orne and the commanding officer, Lieutenant- Colonel N.H. Ross, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his handling of the battalion throughout the battle. On 24 July, the battalion was placed under command of 5 Brigade to secure the start line for the brigade's attack on May-sur-Orne and Fontenay-le-Marmion. A composite force from \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies under Major Lane met fierce resistance and reinforcements were needed before the start line was secured. Still under 5 Brigade, the Camerons had elements of The Black Watch of Canada and The Calgary Highlanders placed under command on 25 July, to occupy Saint Martin to protect the left flank of le Régiment de Maisonneuve attacking May-sur-Orne. The Maisonneuve attack was unsuccessful and that evening they relieved the Camerons in Saint Martin. On 26 July, the Camerons returned under command of 6th Brigade and set about consolidating their positions in Saint-André-sur-Orne. On 31 July, the unit started rotating companies out of the line two at a time for rest and refit. \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies remained in Saint-André-sur-Orne under command of Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal while the remainder of the unit was withdrawn to Caen for rest. Even in the rest area the unit was subject to enemy artillery and was required to dig in to minimize casualties. On 1 August, Battalion Headquarters and \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were resting in the vicinity of Faub-de-Vaucelle while \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies were still under command of Les Fusiliers Mont- Royal in Saint-André-sur-Orne. That evening \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies relieved \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies and provided support to Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal in capture of a church in the vicinity that was occupied by the Germans. On 3 August, \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies assisted Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal in taking a group of houses that had been identified as being occupied by the Germans by Cameron patrols the night before. On the 2nd Canadian Division front the mine directly south of Saint-Martin-de-Fontenay had been a constant threat, the lofty shaft towers affording the Germans excellent observation and the mine tunnels offering a means of infiltrating the whole area. On the night of 3–4 August, \\"A\\" Company with a detachment of the 11th Field Company, Royal Canadian Engineers, conducted a raid on an enemy occupied mine. The company succeeded in surrounding the mine despite heavy machine gun fire but the accompanying engineers were unable to demolish the mine shaft. In order to demolish the shaft towers, the sappers had to climb some from the ground and as soon as they did so they became targets for snipers in the bright moonlight. After a number of men had been hit, it was decided that the demolition task could not be carried out, and the raiding party withdrew. Casualties suffered on the raid were 9 missing and 21 wounded which speaks to the fierceness of the resistance. Three prisoners from the 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (one corporal, one lance corporal and one private) were taken during the raid. On 4 August, Lieutenant- Colonel Runice took command of the battalion, and that night the Camerons moved to Verrières to relieve The Essex Scottish Regiment. The next two days were relatively quiet with the unit patrolling and receiving only occasional shelling from the enemy. A prisoner from the 1055th Grenadier Regiment of the 89th Infantry Division was captured by patrol from \\"C\\" Company. The battalions of the 6th Brigade had been tasked to attack the villages forming the front line. On the afternoon of 7 August, the Camerons moved to a forming up position near Ifs in preparation for an attack against Fontenay-le-Marmion that night. \\"D\\" and \\"C\\" Companies led the attack with \\"B\\" Company in close support and \\"A\\" Company in reserve. \\"D\\" Company had a difficult time securing their objective. Within ten minutes of crossing the start line, 16 Platoon was pinned down by intense machine gun fire. When 18 Platoon conducted a left flanking attack to free up 16 Platoon, they came under intense 88 mm mortar fire pining them down as well. The company crawled forward into an assault line and then launched an all-out frontal attack, fighting their way into the village against fierce opposition by elements of the German 89th Infantry Division. By 0100 hours \\"D\\" Company had reached their objective, the first company to do so, and began preparing for counter-attacks. \\"C\\" Company had their own difficulties in the assault. 13 and 14 Platoon were temporarily cut off from 15 Platoon and \\"C\\" Company headquarters when they advanced past a nest of enemy machine gun posts. The enemy allowed the forward platoons to pass and then poured heavy fire into \\"C\\" Company Headquarters and remaining platoon, which after sustaining several casualties, bypassed the machine gun posts by working their way around the left flank. \\"C\\" Company Headquarters and 13 Platoon reached their objective, the orchard, hoping to find the other two platoons but only encountered elements of \\"B Company\\". Linking in their defensive positions with \\"B\\" Company on the east side of the orchard, they prepared to fight off the inevitable enemy counter-attack. Almost immediately after crossing the start line, \\"B\\" Company came under fire from both sides of the road. In response \\"B\\" Company launched a determined attack on the quarry, where a concentration of enemy were dug in, with 11 Platoon forward, 10 Platoon left and 12 Platoon right. Sergeant J. Mahon was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions in the fight for the quarry. Once they had cleared the enemy from the quarry, \\"B\\" Company continued on to the outskirts of Fontenay-le-Marmion to link up with the remnants of \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Companies occupying the buildings. The Camerons holding Fontenay-le-Marmion were under fire from heavy sniping and direct fire from a German 88 mm gun to the northeast and the number of casualties grew. Engaged in heavy house-to-house fighting through the night and into the morning, the battalion, down to 150 men, fought off numerous enemy counter-attacks. Battalion headquarters was hit by an enemy 88 mm, wounding the commanding officer. Overnight 14 men from 14 Platoon and one from 13 Platoon who had worked their way back to the start line were brought up to rejoin \\"C\\" Company, and Major C. W. Ferguson, a Cameron serving as brigade major of 6th Brigade, was sent to take over the battalion. On the morning of 8 August, the enemy counterattacked from the north with 12 Tiger Tanks and the unit was temporarily surrounded. To add to the chaos, battalion headquarters was hit again likely by the same 88 mm that had been shelling the unit from the start of the battle. The new commanding officer was wounded, forcing Major J. J. D. Gagnon, Officer Commanding \\"D\\" Company to assume command. On the afternoon of 8 August, two companies of the South Saskatchewan Regiment with a squadron of the 1st Hussars broke through, swept the ridge north of Fontenay and cleared the left flank, relieving the pressure on the Camerons. The Camerons captured 207 enemy prisoners that day. That night Cameron patrols confirmed that the enemy had withdrawn. On the morning of 9 August \\"B\\" Company (under Company Sergeant Major Abram Arbour) launched a successful attack on the right flank and \\"A\\" Company captured a barracks on the high feature that was the source of the heavy fire that was pinning whole Battalion down. The clearing weather allowed Royal Air Force Typhoons to locate and destroy the German 88 mm that had been wreaking so much havoc on Battalion Headquarters. In the evening Major E. P. \\"Tommy\\" Thompson assumed acting command of the battalion. In the fierce fighting for Fontenay- le-Marmion, the Camerons lost two commanding officers wounded (Ferguson would die from his wounds the next day), and two company commanders, Major E. R. Talbot of \\"C\\" Company and Major J. E. E. McManus of \\"B\\" Company and the adjutant, Captain G. Kidd, wounded in action. The carrier platoon commander, Captain R.R. Counsell, was awarded the Military Cross for keeping the companies supplied during the fighting and Company Sergeant-Major Arbour was awarded the Military Cross (a decoration usually awarded to officers) for his actions as acting company commander of \\"B\\" Company during the battle. The remainder of 9 and 10 August, were spent resting and reorganizing prior to relieving The North Nova Scotia Highlanders at Gouvix the next day. Patrols the night of 9 August, brought in a couple of prisoners – one from the 1056th Infantry Regiment and the other from the 189th Anti-Tank Battalion. At dawn on 12 August, \\"B\\" Company stood-to, only to discover it was completely surrounded by an enemy patrol. A brief skirmish ensued and the enemy withdrew. Later that day the new commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel A. S. Gregory arrived to assume command. In the early morning of 14 August, the battalion launched an attack to clear enemy pockets west of the River Laize and seize a bridgehead across the river at Clair Tizon. Initially resistance was light but stiffened as the Camerons approached the river. The Battalion's objective was seized by 0910 hours and that night the anti-tank platoon got their first kill – a Panzerkampfwagen V (Panther) that was knocked out at a range of about . Two of the crew were killed and the remainder taken prisoner by Scout Platoon snipers who were in the area. Numerous prisoners of war were taken in the operation, many of them Poles and Russians who were happy to desert from their impressed service in the Wehrmacht. The next day, 15 August, the Camerons took Saint- Martin-de-Bienfaite-la-Cressonnière and held it against three fierce counter- attacks by elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. One of only two Bronze Stars awarded to members of the regiment during the war was won during the battle for Saint-Martin-de-Bienfaite-la-Cressonnière. Private J. P. DeGarmo was awarded the American decoration for his actions. That afternoon bombers from No. 6 (RCAF) Bomber Group dropped bombs on enemy pockets of resistance between the Cameron lines and Falaise. Several bombs fell short, landing on Battalion headquarters and inflicting eight casualties. More casualties were suffered when the Regimental Aid Post was shelled by an enemy 88 mm. The Medical Officer, Captain H. Marantz and Sergeant G. A. Wilwand were both killed and the remainder of the Aid Post wounded. 10 Field Ambulance put together a composite force and sent it forward to act as the Cameron Regimental Aid Post. The task of taking the ruins of Falaise fell to 6 Brigade. At 1500 hours on 16 August, Brigadier Young launched his attack with the South Saskatchewan Regiment on the left and the Camerons on the right, each supported by a squadron of tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers. As the battalion moved towards Falaise, they ran into a group of 25 enemy of which 2 were taken prisoner. The huge craters caused by the earlier RAF bombing impeded the advance. Moreover, parties of the enemy from the 12th SS Panzer Division were still fighting hard in the ruins. By the morning of 17 August, the South Saskatchewans had reached the railway east of the town. The Camerons had not advanced as rapidly, their tanks being hung up in craters; but they finished their task that day and then moved south across the River Traine to establish a defensive position around the village of Hérouville-Saint-Clair. Many enemy prisoners of war were taken (a number from the 978th Grenadier Regiment) and a scout car that had run out of gas was captured as well. That night a flight of U.S. Army Air Force P-38 Lightnings bombed and strafed the unit killing two and wounding six. On 18 August, contact was firmly established with Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal. The relative quiet allowed hot meals, mail and new clothing to be enjoyed by all members of the unit. The pause also allowed the commanding officer to reorganize the battalion in preparation for future operations. Patrols from the unit netted a number of prisoners (two from the 1056th Infantry Battalion, one from the 128th Grenadier Regiment, one from the 937th Infantry Reserve Regiment and one from the 453rd Reserve Grenadier Battalion). On 19 August, the battalion moved to a new location near Les Moutien on Auges by the Dives River and then on to an assembly area at le Grand Mesnil on 21 August. That night they moved again, this time to a position near Meulles. On 22 August, the battalion pushed towards Orbec, slowing as they met increasingly stiff opposition and heavy fire from the high ground across the Orbec River. Spending the night near Les Bois, southwest of Orbec, the Camerons launched a left flanking attack north of Orbec the next day. Seizing their objective, the battalion fought off counter-attacks by enemy infantry supported by tanks and self-propelled guns. After having two tanks and a self-propelled gun knocked out, the Germans withdrew, leaving the unit in firm possession of Orbec. The Camerons were greatly assisted in the taking of the town by the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars), who had crossed the river to the west of the town and then circled back and taken out an enemy blocking position from the rear. With the withdrawal of the enemy, two Cameron scouts were finally able to emerge from the town jail where they had been hiding with a German commander and his staff that they had captured, waiting for the battalion to capture the town. On 24 August, the Camerons marched to an assembly area at Le Ruquesni where they were picked up by trucks and moved to the 6 Brigade area at Ducore. That night they moved again to an area north of Saint-Pierre-de-Salerne where they were warned to be prepared to move south into Brionne. On 25 August, the battalion moved into Brionne against slight resistance and received a hearty welcome by the townspeople. Previous to this the towns the battalion had liberated had been abandoned by the inhabitants. Brionne was the first of many towns to greet the Camerons as liberators. On 26 August, the battalion was on the move again, taking up positions for the night along the Seine near Bourgtheroulde. The next day the Camerons continued the advance through Bourgtheroulde, meeting determined resistance as the German rearguard fought fanatically to protect their line of retreat across the Seine. By late evening the battalion had consolidated their position near La Chênaie, overlooking the Seine and effectively cutting off the German escape route. For the next three days the unit suffered heavy casualties from intense shelling, also inflicting heavy casualties on the retreating Germans trying to cross the river. The War Diary entry for 29 August noted, \\"Thousands of Germans drowned or were killed from our 4.2\\" mortars and arty fire plus our MMGs.\\" By 30 August, the fight was over. The German remnants had retreated from the Seine and Rouen area. The next day the battalion moved across the River Seine into Rouen to be greeted once again as liberators. September 1944 found the unit in the west suburbs of Rouen. From there they moved to occupy barracks formerly used by German Engineers south of Dieppe. For the next four days the unit participated in parades and commemorative ceremonies to mark the 2nd Division's previous visit to Dieppe in August 1942. Aside from the ceremonial duties it was an opportunity to rest and reconsolidate. On 6 September, the battalion loaded on trucks and moved to Autingues, where they spent the night of 7 September, before moving on to Furnes. On 9 September, the unit occupied La Panne Bains, chasing out scattered pockets of German resistance. The next day the unit continued the advance through fire from heavy machine guns, mortars, anti- aircraft guns and heavy coastal guns and spent the night occupying a portion of the German West Wall defences. The advance towards Bray-Dunes continued on 11 September, against increasingly stiff opposition from elements of the 1055th Grenadier Regiment of the German 89th Infantry Division. Before first light on 13 September, the Camerons launched a concerted attack against Bray- Dunes. \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies made a right flanking attack through the sand dunes by the coast while \\"D\\" Company infiltrated through the enemy lines to size the crossroads. While \\"D\\" Company achieved their objective by 0530 hours, \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies failed to penetrate enemy opposition leaving \\"D\\" Company surrounded and cut off. At 1800 hours the battalion launched a right flanking attack through Gyrelde to relieve \\"D\\" Company. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies were stopped after passing through Gyrelde but \\"C\\" Company on the left flank fought through fierce opposition to occupy a position south of \\"D\\" Company but could not complete the link up until the following evening. By early afternoon on 15 September, the battalion had secured Bray-Dunes. That evening the unit was moved to a rest area east of Bray Dunes where they kept up aggressive patrolling each night. Warrant Officer F. K. Breakey won the DCM during the battle for Bray-Dunes. On 19 September, the battalion moved to Duffel where they were to stay until 23 September. Arriving in the vicinity of Sint-Job- in-'t-Goor, the Camerons advanced as the reserve battalion in the 6 Brigade advance to the Antwerp-Turnhout canal. On 27 September, the battalion took up new positions west of Gravemwezel, trading fire back and forth across the canal with the enemy and conducting aggressive patrolling. During one of these patrols Lieutenant E. J. Reid won the Military Cross. On 29 September, the unit moved again to cross the Anvers-Turnhout canal under the command of 5th Brigade to relieve le Régiment de Maisonneuve in the area of Oostbrecht. On 1 October, the Camerons, again under the command of 5th Brigade, launched an attack against Sternhoven. Taking the objective, the battalion was immediately ordered to carry on to their subsequent objective, a crossroads. Before they could get out of Sternhoven the Camerons were hit by a concerted counter- attack and spent the night in desperate close combat amongst the burning buildings of the town. Successfully beating off the counter-attack, the unit handed Sternhoven over to Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal and began preparations to continue the advance towards Camp de Brasschaet. Before the Cameron attack could get underway, the Germans launched another counter-attack on Sternhoven and the unit went to the aid of Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, quashing the final enemy attempt to regain the town. Probing towards Camp de Brasschaet on the morning of 2 October, \\"B\\" Company, with tanks from The Fort Garry Horse in support, met heavy resistance and was forced to retire to their former positions. On 3 October the battalion launched an attack on Camp de Brasschaet and secured the objective taking 82 prisoners of war from the 1018th Grenadier Regiment and 14th Reserve Machine Gun Battalion. On 5 October, \\"C\\" Company, tasked to clear the road to Sternhoven, was forced to retire after taking heavy casualties. \\"A\\" Company was moved forward in their place to consolidate in the Lake area. The battalion remained at Camp de Brasschaet for the next few days, resting and reorganizing for their next operation. An active patrolling program netted 92 prisoners of war. On 9 October, the battalion moved to an area northeast of Putte to relieve the Essex Scottish with Battalion Headquarters setting up at Villa Anna. On 10 October, the battalion secured the flank of the successful 2nd Division attack to cut off the German garrison south of the Scheldt and the islands north of the river. Resuming vigorous patrolling, three prisoners from the 847th Grenadier Regiment were taken on 11 October. During this period a company of 150 men of the Belgian White Brigade came under command of the Camerons. On the night of 14–15 October, three German paratroopers were captured by another patrol. On the evening of 20 October, the battalion moved to relieve The Royal Regiment of Canada and then again the next day to relieve The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry at Woensdrecht. Patrols overnight on 22–23 in preparation for an attack on 23 August brought in seven prisoners of war. Launched at 0700 hours, the attack on Woensdrecht met stiff resistance and by 1630 hours \\"A\\" Company, which had gone to the assistance of the South Saskatchewan Regiment, was forced back to its former positions. Despite the fierce opposition, the battalion captured 40 paratroopers from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment. Continuing the attack on 24 October, the Camerons made good progress against only light opposition, the majority of the enemy having withdrawn after the sharp fighting the previous day. By 2300 hours the area was cleared of enemy, and the battalion was relieved by the Black Watch of Canada. Private C. R. J. Batty was awarded a Military Medal for his actions. On 26 October, the unit moved into the Beveland Causeway. On 27 October the Camerons seized the town of Yerseke and launched an assault across the Zuid-Beveland canal. Landing two companies on the island forming the lock gates on the west side, the attack was repulsed by mortar and heavy machine gun fire and the companies forced back across the canal. Another attempt to secure the lock bridges the next day succeeded in reaching the objective but was forced back across the canal once again. Lieutenant-Colonel Tommy Thompson was awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his actions. On 29 October, the battalion crossed the canal to relieve two companies of the Essex Scottish at Wemeldinge. That night Corporal M. J. Robertson from \\"A\\" Company brought in 21 prisoners of war (19 from 1020th Grenadier Regiment of the 70th Infantry Division and two from 170th Feld Ersatz) he and two others had taken at Kattendijke while on a wandering patrol of their own. On 30 October, the battalion moved to Goes to relieve the Black Watch of Canada where they remained the next day. On 1 November, the battalion moved to Willebroek for rest and refit. On 9 November, the Camerons were on the move again, this time to the town of Mook en Middelaar to relieve the 5th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry of the British 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. The remainder of the month was spent opposite the Meuse River in the vicinity of Mook, dug into the flooded, soggy ground. While trading mortar fire back and forth with the enemy \\"A\\" Company had a couple of interesting incidents. Private R. L. Shaw had a mortar bomb glance off his shoulder and land directly in his trench without detonating. Later an \\"A\\" Company observation post was asked to observe the fall of shot from friendly mortars when they received notice to keep their heads down as a mortar bomb was coming over minus its tail fin, and would likely drop short. When asked to provide a correction for the next round, the OP replied, \\"Cut all the tail fins off!\\". The defective bomb had landed on a close by German machine gun nest, which had been giving the company great difficulty. Patrolling by both sides, intermittent shelling, and occasional mine strikes, inflicted light casualties on the battalion and ensured soldiers kept their edge in the miserable conditions. December would prove to be a relatively quiet month for the battalion. On 1 December, the Camerons handed over their sodden positions at Mook to the Royal Regiment of Canada and moved to Cuijk to relieve the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. The battalion stayed in the Cuijk area resting, refitting and training until 8 December, when then moved to Bisselt to relieve the Black Watch of Canada. The unit remained at Bisselt for a week, conducting an aggressive patrolling program. On 15 December, the battalion handed over to the South Saskatchewan Regiment and moved into Groesbeek. The battalion front remained fairly quiet with sporadic machine gun and mortar fire interrupting the calm. On the night of 19–20 December, the battalion provided fire support for a South Saskatchewan Regiment attack. During this action Lance Corporal M. L. Nedohin won the Military Medal. On 23 December, the unit was relieved in place by the Essex Scottish and moved with Battalion Headquarters, \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" Companies setting up in the area of Mook, Support Company in the area of Katwijk across the Meuse River and \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" Companies at Oss. The battalion shot down an enemy aircraft the night of 26 December, capturing four of the aircrew south of Nijmegen. On 27 December \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were relieved at Oss by the North Nova Scotia Highlanders. \\"A\\" Company relocated to Mook and \\"D\\" Company joined Support Company at Katwijk. The battalion would spend the rest of the month in location resting, training and marking the holiday season. On 8 January 1945, the battalion received orders to relieve le Régiment de Maisonneuve the next day. Subsequent orders on 9 January delayed the move to 10 January. In the line again, the Camerons came under sporadic mortar, small arms and sniper fire and once again initiated an aggressive patrolling program. Overnight on 17–18 January, \\"C\\" Company conducted a platoon size raid on a number of enemy held houses. On the afternoon of 18 January, the battalion was relieved by Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal and moved back into the town of Mook proper. The Camerons were back in the line on 25 January, having relieved the South Saskatchewan Regiment. On 31 January the unit shifted to take over from Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal while the South Saskatchewans moved out of reserve to occupy the positions the Camerons were vacating. Visited by the Brigade Commander, Brigadier General Ralph Holley Keefler on 3 February, the unit was tasked with capturing a prisoner at any cost. A raid by \\"A\\" Company on the night of 5 February, failed to secure the required prisoner but a fighting patrol from \\"C\\" Company succeeded two nights later. Due largely to Company Sergeant-Major Elvin Miller's heroic efforts, for which he was recommended for the Distinguished Conduct Medal, later downgraded to a Military Medal by a higher level headquarters, the Camerons were able to bring back a prisoner, and obtain the information that was crucial to the planning of the upcoming Operation Veritable. On 8 February, Operation Veritable was launched with a 1,000 gun barrage. Due to the large number of casualties it had suffered since the start of the campaign, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division would sit this one out. Over the next few days, dozens of German soldiers surrendered themselves to the battalion. 13 prisoners were taken from the 1222nd Grenadier Regiment on 9 February, and another 18 the next day. By 11 February, the battalion front was quiet, the enemy having either withdrawn or been captured. On 14 February, after three months in and around Mook, the unit was transported to Nijmegen where they went into billets for a few days of rest and refit. On 17 February the battalion moved across the border into Nazi Germany, taking up positions in Bedburg. On 18 February, the commanding officer and intelligence officer conducted a reconnaissance of the ground southeast of Kalkar approaching the Hochwald in preparation for the upcoming offensive. The next night the battalion was placed under command of the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade and tasked to send \\"B\\" Company to relieve \\"D\\" Company of the Royal Regiment of Canada. That night the Anti-Tank Platoon took one prisoner from the 1st Battalion, 60th Panzergrenadier Division. In the early hours of 20 February, the unit was ordered to send another company to the Royal Regiment of Canada. After taking up new position in the Royals area, \\"A\\" Company was placed under command of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and dispatched to reinforce them against enemy counter-attack by the Panzer-Lehr- Division. By sunrise the remainder of the unit had been ordered to take over from the Royal Regiment of Canada and movement began to relieve the Royals so they could in turn relieve the Essex Scottish. By late afternoon the battalion was relieved by the Highland Light Infantry of Canada and had reverted to 6th Brigade command. The battalion spent 21 February preparing for the next day's offensive only to have the attack postponed that night. Preparations continued on 22 February, with the operation still postponed. Finally in the early morning of 26 February, Operation Blockbuster was launched. Riding in Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers, the initial advance was held up by mines and mud forced the battalion to re-route their attack through Les Fusiliers Mont- Royal's objective. \\"A\\" Company rode onto the objective in their Kangaroos, and secured it after overcoming stiff resistance from the 156th Panzergrenadier Regiment. \\"B\\" Company reached their objective in the vicinity of \\"Luisendorf\\" (See p. 159 Whatever Men Dare, but probably Neulouisendorf, NL) with only 34 effectives, many of their Kangaroos having bogged down or gotten lost on the way. With two tanks in intimate support the greatly reduced \\"B\\" Company took the objective, capturing 26 prisoners on the way to the town and another 90 in Neulouisendorf itself. \\"C\\" Company landed on their objective without opposition after spending considerable time trying to find it. Within an hour of securing the objective \\"C\\" Company was forced to fight off the first of numerous counter-attacks, as a pair of enemy tanks engaged their positions. It was only \\"D\\" Company that was to reach their objective with little trouble. After hard fighting the unit had secured its objectives and taken 136 prisoners but at great loss – the dynamic and popular commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel E. P. \\"Tommy\\" Thompson was dead, killed by a sniper on the objective. It was during this action that the regiment received its second Victoria Cross nominee. Major David Rodgers, Officer Commanding \\"A\\" Company, was recommended to receive the VC for his actions on 26 February 1945. The citation was approved at every level until it reached 21st Army Group where Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery downgraded the award to an immediate Distinguished Service Order. The Germans continued counter-attacking on 27 February, but the most of the enemy attacks were broken up with well-directed mortar and artillery fire. That night the battalion was relieved by the 5th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and moved to Kirsel. 28 February, was spent reorganizing and preparing for the next offensive. 1 March, found the unit at Udermerbruck preparing to resume the attack. The next day the battalion advanced through the Hochwald Gap. The tanks in support could not stay with the unit, unable to crest the ridge at the edge of the gap due to intense enemy 88 mm fire. Approaching the objective the unit held up short, finding friendly forces already occupying the Battalion's assigned objective. Following a 39-minute artillery barrage, the Camerons resumed the attack on 3 March meeting stiff resistance. Under intense mortar, machine gun and artillery fire the unit made slow progress. \\"C\\" Company was stopped and forced to pull back while \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies managed to fight forward to the new objective on the southeastern edge of the forest, \\"B\\" Company taking 18 prisoners from the 24th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 8th Fallschirmjäger Division in the process. A German counter-attack from the north fell on \\"B\\" Company but was successfully repulsed with around two-dozen casualties inflicted on the enemy. During the fighting in the Hochwald two Cameron Corporals won the Military Medal for their heroism, Corporal John Bukurak of \\"A\\" Company and Corporal Daniel Connors of \\"B\\" Company. The next day the Camerons turned north to clear the east edge of the Hochwald Forest. The unit found the enemy had withdrawn but had left the area heavily mined which made the woods clearance a slow and dangerous undertaking. On 5 March the unit moved to Exhmachdurm where Lieutenant-Colonel A. A. Kennedy assumed command from Major R. H. Lane who had been acting CO since Tommy Thompson had been killed at Kalkar Ridge. The next day the battalion continued the advance through the Hochwald. Preceded by an artillery barrage, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies led the advance. \\"A\\" Company was stopped short of their objective, coming under an intense crossfire from German machine guns. \\"B\\" Company was similarly held up after advancing . Despite the use of tanks and artillery support, the unit could not dislodge the enemy resistance and withdrew under orders from 6th Brigade. A second attack was required utilizing all of 5th Brigade augmented by the South Saskatchewan Regiment to overcome the resistance. The next two days the Camerons spent resting and refitting in preparation for resuming the advance. On 9 March, the unit moved into Xanten to relieve the Calgary Highlanders. The completion of the relief was delayed due to enemy action along the Calgary Highlander's front. \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies effected their relief that night but \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were not able to take over the Calgary Highlander positions until the next morning. Patrols from Scout Platoon netted 28 prisoners overnight mostly from the 6th Fallschirmjäger Battalion. On the afternoon of 10 March the unit moved again, this time to relieve le Régiment de Maisonneuve at Birten. 11 March, was spent resting and reorganizing and the next day the unit was pulled out of the line to a Division rest area at Rindern. The next five days were spent training and performing much needed maintenance on the unit's vehicles and equipment. On 18 March, the unit executed Operation Loot aimed at clearing an enemy salient in the Rindern area. All companies crossed their start lines at 0700 hours and finding the area almost completely vacated, completed clearing their respective objectives by noon. \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were tasked with clearing the remainder of the salient and final success was reported at 1800 hours. Nine evacuees were gathered up in the operation and sent back for screening. 19 March, found the unit moving into the Reichswald Forest where it would spend the next eight days refitting and training for crossing the Rhine. On 28 March, with the Camerons in the lead, the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade moved to \\"Blackfriars Bridge\\" and crossed the Rhine to begin the drive to the North Sea. The battalion set up east of Praest, in the vicinity of Schriek, overnight and began establishing its presence through aggressive patrolling. \\"A\\" Company patrols brought in 8 prisoners and \\"B\\" Company patrols netted 64 prisoners overnight. That night \\"D\\" Company was tasked to probe forward to the town of Netterden. Finding the town held by a company of German paratroopers, Major D. D. Sweeting, Officer Commanding \\"D\\" Company, decided to launch a dawn attack to clear the town. Upon receiving Sweeting's update, the CO tasked \\"C\\" Company under Captain F. R. Sutton to move around to the northeast of the town to cut off the enemy when \\"D\\" Company attacked. \\"D\\" Company's attack went in as planned at 0400 hours on 30 March. Finding their line of retreat cut off the German paratroopers decided to stand and fight. After seven hours of bitter street fighting a truce was called to evacuate the wounded on both sides. Making use of the truce, Sweeting issued the German commander an ultimatum, surrender within the next half an hour or be totally destroyed. Realizing his position hopeless, the German commander surrendered. Of the original company from the 17th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Division garrisoning Netterden, only 2 officers and 22 soldiers survived to go into captivity as prisoners of war. During their two days in the area the battalion captured a total of 2 enemy officers and 128 other ranks at a cost of 4 Camerons killed and 10 wounded. For his successful company attack on Netterden Major Sweeting received the Distinguished Service Order. Consolidating in Netterden, the unit continued the attack towards on 31 March. Supported by an intense artillery barrage \\"A\\" Company under Captain J. Free captured their objective without incurring a single casualty, taking 30 prisoners in the process. \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were less fortunate. Having pushed past \\"A\\" Company for phase 2 of the attack, both \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were met by withering machine gun fire past their start lines. The condition of the ground made it impossible to employ tanks, so the Carrier Platoon was tasked to assist \\"D\\" Company. Engaged by a German self-propelled gun while attempting to move up, Carrier Platoon was unable to reach the forward companies. With no way forward, both companies were withdrawn, \\"D\\" Company with considerable difficulty, to reorganize for a renewed attack the next day. For his actions during the battle Corporal Abbot Fraser was awarded the Bronze Lion, a Dutch decoration. While this was happening \\"C\\" Company was fulfilling a task of its own, securing a road junction to provide a maintenance route for 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Encountering stiff enemy resistance, \\"C\\" Company managed to secure their objective by executing a hasty flanking attack. For his actions during the attack, Sergeant Robert Pearcey was awarded the Military Medal. The battalion renewed their attack on 1 April, to find that the bulk of the enemy had withdrawn leaving only scattered pockets of resistance to be overcome. By noon all companies had consolidated on their objectives. The unit spent the night in Ziek and moved to Keienburg the next day to relieve the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. On 3 April, \\"C\\" Company and the Carrier Platoon captured Steenderen without opposition, taking three prisoners of war from the 951st Grenadier Regiment of the 361st Volksgrenadier Division southwest of the town. That night the battalion moved to relieve the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry at Almen. The 4 April was a relatively quiet day. A lone German self-propelled gun that was being a nuisance was located and knocked out and patrols probed forward to determine the location of the enemy's forward defensive line. The majority of the unit spent the day resting and preparing to continue the advance. The next night the battalion moved across the canal and on 6 April, Oolden was seized without opposition with a number of prisoners from the 1409th Fortress Battalion taken. Moving to a concentration in the vicinity of Bathmensche Veen, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies forced a quick crossing of the Schipbeek canal with \\"C\\" Company following close behind. Surprise was achieved and no opposition was experienced until the companies were consolidating on the far side when the Germans started to shell the company positions and the crossing points heavily. Two Company Commanders were put out of action by the enemy mortar fire. Major H. P. Falloon, Officer Commanding \\"B\\" Company was seriously wounded and Major W. S. Watt, Officer Commanding \\"C\\" Company was knocked unconscious. That night \\"D\\" Company crossed the canal and moved past \\"A\\" Company to clear the woods while the remainder of the battalion, still under intermittent shellfire, extended and consolidated their positions in the vicinity of De Lurkens. On 7 April, \\"B\\" Company cleared the woods east of its positions taking thirty-six prisoners. The next day \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" Companies successfully extended the left flank of the battalion against slight opposition from the Germans. On 9 April, the battalion moved to a concentration area to be picked up by troop-carrying vehicles for a move to Spoorweg Bosch to relieve the Essex Scottish on 10 April. That night the Camerons were on the move again moving to Gramsbergen. On 11 April the unit continued on to Balkbrug and then swung north through Kirkenbosch to Hoogeveen finally stopping at Terhost for the night. The next day \\"D\\" Company and two sections from Carrier Platoon made a bridgehead across the canal, and the battalion continued north to take up positions around Hijken. 13 April was spent at Hijken resting and maintaining equipment with \\"C\\" Company and Carrier Platoon patrolling to the north and west to mop up enemy stragglers. On 14 April, the battalion launched an attack on Haren. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies were tasked with clearing the northern half of the town and \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Companies the southern half. Scout Platoon under Lieutenant R. A. King cleared out the factory in the town, capturing 60 enemy prisoners. By 2300 hours all companies reported their areas completely cleared. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies consolidated in Haren while \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Companies passed through them to establish positions on the outskirts of Groningen. The next day Battalion Headquarters moved up to Groningen followed by \\"A\\" Company, which took over a position from the Essex Scottish dominating the bridge over the Ems Canal. The remainder of the day was spent mopping up enemy stragglers throughout the Battalion's area. The Camerons captured a total of one hundred and forty German prisoners on 15 April. The following day the unit passed through Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal to clear the northeast sector of the town up to the Van Starkenborgh Canal. \\"B\\" Company arrived at the canal to find the bridge over it held by the Germans who had raised the centre span making it impassable. Aided by two Dutch civilians Lieutenant W. C. McNeill crossed a narrow catwalk, which was being swept with automatic weapons fire, to the bridge mechanism and lowered the bridge. \\"B\\" Company quickly attacked across the bridge and the German resistance collapsed. Establishing a bridgehead on the east bank of the canal, \\"B\\" Company rounded up twenty-six prisoners in the process. McNeill and one of the Dutch civilians were wounded in lowering the bridge but their heroic actions had enabled the company's success. That evening the battalion was ordered to occupy the town of Ten Boer. Through a series of company infiltrations the unit occupied the objective overnight and by 0720 hours of 17 April, all elements were firmly ensconced in the town. The remainder of 17 and 18 April, were spent resting, reorganizing and preparing to resume the advance. On the night of 18 April \\"C\\" Company set up outposts at Ten Post and along the road to Stedum. On 19 April the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel A. A. Kennedy, showing signs of combat fatigue accumulated from his exemplary service in the Italian Campaign, was relieved of command and granted 48 hours leave of absence. Ultimately he would never return to the Camerons. Major R. H. Lane took over the battalion as temporary commanding officer. That afternoon \\"A\\" Company, supported by a section of flamethrowers, was sent to probe enemy positions in the towns of Stedum, Loppersum and Wirten. Encountering the enemy on the outskirts of Loppersum, \\"A\\" Company broke contact after a brief engagement returning with the information that between 100 and 200 Germans were holding Loppersum. A planned move the next day was postponed and on 21 April, the unit moved back into Germany to occupy billets in Wilderhausen. The battalion resumed the advance on 22 April, as the depth battalion of the brigade. Taking over the lead from Les Fusiliers Mont- Royal that evening, the unit encountered stiffening resistance as they closed on Kirchhatten. \\"A\\" Company overcame a roadblock with the assistance of Wasp flamethrower carriers and the request was sent back to bring up tank support to assist gaining lodgement in the town. On 23 April \\"B\\" Company started off the attack on Kirchhatten, clearing the woods on the left of the axis of advance south of the town and taking 24 prisoners. Company Sergeant-Major Earl Ovens, who had already been Mentioned in Dispatches for his actions at Dieppe as a private, was awarded the Military Medal for his part in \\"B\\" Company's attack. \\"C\\" Company then passed through \\"B\\" to carry the attack into Kirchhatten. The Battalion Tactical Headquarters, \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Companies were counter-attacked with one of the \\"D\\" Company Platoon being forced back by the onslaught. The Unit launched an immediate counter-counterattack supported by artillery and tanks, regaining their positions and driving the enemy back into the woods. After a relatively quiet night with patrols sent out to pinpoint the enemy, the attack resumed the next day. \\"D\\" Company led off with \\"B\\" Company following. Running into resistance, \\"D\\" Company requested \\"A\\" Company move up on the left to provide support. Bolstered by a section of Wasps, a troop of tanks and a section of assault pioneers, \\"A\\" Company moved to assist. That night the enemy launched a small counterattack against \\"B\\" Company. Easily repulsed, the Germans launched a second, much larger attack, which \\"B\\" Company only managed to fight off by calling artillery down on their own positions. The unit conducted a busy patrol program overnight. On the morning of 25 April \\"D\\" Company succeeded in securing their objectives, and \\"A\\" Company was ordered to send a contact patrol to link up with \\"D\\". Kirchhatten was finally secured and Lieutenant-Colonel R. L. Rutherford, returned to the regiment from his position as brigade major of 6th Brigade to take command of the battalion. On 26 April, the unit was still under intermittent shellfire particularly in the \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" Company areas, and spent the day reorganizing and preparing for the next phase of 6 Brigade's advance. Five prisoners of war from the 358th Marine Battalion were taken by \\"B\\" Company. A patrol that night returned with one prisoner who provided information that two companies from the Panzer-Lehr-Division with a combined strength of about 100 was opposing the battalion. Throughout 27 April, the unit continued to exchange mortar and artillery fire with the enemy and \\"A\\" Company fought a brief skirmish with a small party of Germans, taking one prisoner. That evening all companies reported increased enemy vehicle traffic along the front. The artillery duel continued on 28 April, but other enemy activity dropped off significantly. With the exception of the detonation of several road cratering charges, no other enemy activity was observed. 29 April, was even quieter and \\"B\\" Company pushed forward along the road to the northwest of the town to establish new positions at the road junction. The advance resumed the morning of 30 April, with \\"C\\" Company moving through \\"B\\" Company's positions to lead off. \\"D\\" and \\"B\\" Company advanced along their axis with \\"A\\" following behind \\"B\\" as the battalion reserve. All companies made good progress, and a dozen prisoners were gathered up as the Camerons moved forward. The advance continued unopposed until early evening when \\"C\\" Company ran into a well defended road block and crater. The battalion deployed to cover the main crossroads and dug in for the night. Patrols were sent out that night to recce the road block and potential routes. On the morning of 1 May, the advance resumed. The road block was destroyed with an anti-tank gun and \\"A\\" Company passed through \\"C\\" Company with \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies continuing the advance along their own axis. \\"A\\" Company encountered resistance from a small group of determined defenders but overcame the enemy with tank and artillery support, taking 11 prisoners from the 1st Battalion of the 22nd Grenadier Regiment of the 490th Infantry Division and the 16th Reinforcement Battalion. By early afternoon the companies were consolidating their positions in the vicinity of Hatter Wuss. A probe by Scout Platoon was strongly repulsed and \\"B\\" Company, occupying the houses vacated by the scouts beat off two small counter-attacks, dispersing the enemy with mortar and artillery fire. The day's advance netted the battalion a total of twenty nine enemy prisoners. Patrols forward of the battalion position the morning of 2 May met no enemy, and the commanding officer continued the push forward. Consolidating in Twee Ibake, the battalion received orders to move to a concentration area at Bummerstede in preparation for moving to enlarge a bridgehead the South Saskatchewan Regiment had established over the Küsten canal. The battalion crossed the Küsten canal on 3 May and moved through the South Saskatchewan Regiment and Les Fusiliers Mont- Royal to establish positions in Oldenburg. Later that afternoon the battalion advanced further north and established new positions for the night. The next day was spent regrouping and at 2000 hours that night the BBC announced that all German forces in northwest Europe would surrender the next morning. A phone call from 6th Brigade Headquarters at 0150 hours confirmed the surrender. Hostilities were over. The victory was celebrated with church parades on 6 May, and a victory parade in Oldenburg on the 9th. Garrison duty kept the battalion in Germany and the Netherlands until the end of September, when they returned to England. Docking at Dover on 30 September, the battalion moved by train to a camp at Farnborough. The Camerons left the U.K. from Southampton on board the RMS Queen Elizabeth on 13 November. Arriving in Halifax, the unit carried on to Montreal, where they boarded the train for the final leg of their journey home to Winnipeg. The Camerons arrived home on 22 November, in the midst of a winter blizzard to be met by a welcoming party of officials, jubilant citizens and tearful relatives. Upon the demobilization of the 1st Battalion, The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, the Reserve Army component, the 2nd Battalion, was officially re-designated the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada effective 1 April 1946. The seeds of the Cold War had been sown well before the close of the Second World War. Militant communism threatened the fleeting peace that was achieved through the defeat of the Axis powers. Operating under the belief that the next war would be nuclear and would likely be finished before a large-scale mobilization of reserves could be affected, the decision was reached that the Regular Army would need to be more robust and would become Canada's main line of defence rather than the Militia. By 1946 the Militia was restored to basically its pre-1939 condition. In 1950 the Red River climbed to its highest level since 1861, resulting in major flooding in Winnipeg from April to June. Heavy autumn rains and a long winter with heavy snowfall followed by a cold spring, which prevented normal thawing, all contributed to the catastrophe. More rainfall in early May exacerbated flooding. In total of Manitoba between the US border and Winnipeg became a vast inland sea. The flood climaxed on the night of 5 May, known as \\"Black Friday\\", when driving rain, sleet and snow swelled the Red River to the point where it tore apart eight dikes and destroyed four of Winnipeg's eleven bridges. Throughout much of the city homes and buildings were engulfed by the floodwaters. The regiment was mobilized in aid of the Civil Power on 8 May. Organized into five work parties, the Camerons were piped to the dykes and worked around the clock in shifts for 17 days until the danger of flood diminished. When the flood was over, 107,000 people had been evacuated from the area. The cost of the flood was estimated at over one billion dollars. In June 1950 the Cold War turned hot with Communist North Korea's invasion of South Korea. Although the Canadian Government chose not to mobilize the Militia to fight overseas, numerous Second World War veterans and serving reservists, including many Camerons, chose to volunteer for the new battalions that were being raised to go to Korea. In 1960, the regiment celebrated its 50th Birthday. Part of the celebrations, the performing of a retreat ceremony on the Manitoba Legislative grounds, was broadcast on national television. The decade would provide little else to celebrate. The 1960s saw a serious erosion of Militia capabilities and morale. Undermanned and issued with aging or obsolete equipment, the reserves were not seen as playing any useful role in a major overseas conflict, particularly with the strategic assessment of the day seeing any future war quickly becoming nuclear and being of short duration. Lacking a war-fighting role, the focus of the Militia concentrated more on domestic operations, particularly territorial defence and survival operations after a nuclear conflict. During the 1970s the role of the Army Reserve shifted again. Unification of the Forces and years of budgetary reductions had resulted in Forces wide personnel shortages. The focus for the Reserves shifted to providing individual soldiers to augment Regular Force units overseas. Camerons increasingly began to deploy as augmentees to Regular Force units on United Nations Peacekeeping duties in places such as Egypt, the Golan Heights and Cyprus and to participate on flyovers to Germany to serve with Canadian units operating with NATO in North- West Europe. In the spring of 1979, the Red River jumped its banks again, rising to the flood levels of 1950. While Winnipeg was protected by the massive floodway built after the 1950 flood, the farming communities to the south were largely unprotected. Within an hour of the call for assistance, the Camerons had assembled and dispatched troops to augment 2 Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) operating inside the ring dyke around Morris, Manitoba. In the 1980s the role of the Militia was once more re-defined. The 1987 Defence White paper espoused the belief that any conflict would only turn nuclear after a series of conventional battles, which would give the belligerents adequate time to mobilize and commit their reserves to battle. This thinking eventually gave rise to the Total Force concept in which the Reserve and Regular components were to be more fully integrated. The 1980s ended with the regiment marking its 79th birthday in 1989. Celebrations were held at Minto Armoury with the itinerary including a military skills demonstration, a performance by the Pipes and Drums, and an all-ranks Regimental Dinner. The 1990s proved to be a very busy decade for the regiment, both operationally and ceremonially. Falling out of Total Force was an increasing role for Reserve augmentation on overseas operations. Starting with Operation Harmony Rotation 1 in 1992 (Croatia) the Camerons began to provide a steady stream of augmentees to Regular Force units deploying on Operations. 1994 and 1995 were the years for big parades. First, the regiment participated in the Freedom of the City parade marking the 50th anniversary of the D Day invasion. Next, the regiment celebrated its 85th birthday in 1995, with a parade at the Manitoba Legislature. Finally, the Camerons participated in the Freedom of the City parade marking the 50th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day (VE Day). Fully focused on training for war once again, the late 1990s found the regiment increasingly involved in domestic operations. In 1997, the regiment was at ground zero for the \\"Flood of the Century\\". This time the scope of the flood was so enormous, not even the floodway could protect Winnipeg as it had in 1979. The Camerons provided volunteers for the 38 Canadian Brigade Group (38 CBG) Composite Company and spent the spring sandbagging and building dykes throughout Southern Manitoba. When the possibility of the Y2K bug threatened to paralyze the nation at the end of 1999, the regiment was tasked to provide Provincial Task Force Manitoba (PTFMB) Company 2 for Operation Abacus. The company headquarters was stood up several days before the end of December and was prepared to initiate a mobilization on order. The new millennium carried on in much the same fashion as the last decade of the previous. When the Reserves were tasked with raising a formed Rifle Company to augment 1 PPCLI on Operation Palladium Rotation 11 to Bosnia in 2002, the Camerons provided the Company second-in-command, Company Administration Officer, and eight other augmentees. In August 2003, disaster struck again. With forest fires raging out of control in many areas of British Columbia, the regiment was called to provide augmentees to fight fires (Operation PEREGRINE). Once again, the Camerons responded to the call. Today the Camerons fulfill both military and ceremonial functions at home and abroad. As an infantry regiment, the unit's main focus is provide trained infantry soldiers to meet the operational requirements of the Canadian Forces. Whether it is augmenting Regular Force units on overseas operations or fighting floods and forest fires at home, the Camerons provide a ready source of trained soldiers. The regiment parades at Minto Armoury, 969 St. Matthews Avenue in Winnipeg on Tuesday nights from the last week of August to the second week of June. During the summer unit members attend military courses throughout Canada.

Sikivie, L. Susskind, M. B. Voloshin and V. I. Zakharov, Nucl. Phys. B 173, 189 (1980). (Note rho is a ratio involving the masses of the weak bosons and the Weinberg angle). With one or more electroweak Higgs doublets in the Higgs sector, the effective action term leftH^dagger D_mu Hright^2/Lambda^2 which generically arises with physics beyond the Standard Model at the scale Λ contributes to the Peskin–Takeuchi parameter T. Current precision electroweak measurements restrict Λ to more than a few TeV. Attempts to solve the gauge hierarchy problem generically require the addition of new particles below that scale, however. What is custodial symmetry? Before electroweak symmetry breaking there was a global SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry in higgs potential which was broken to SU(2) after electroweak symmetry breaking. This remnant symmetry is called custodial symmetry. The total standard model lagrangian would be custodial symmetric if the yukawa couplings are the same, i.e Yu=Yd and hypercharge coupling is zero. It is very important to see beyond the standard model effect by including new terms which violate custodial symmetry. Construction The preferred way of preventing the leftH^dagger D_mu Hright^2/Lambda^2 term from being generated is to introduce an approximate symmetry which acts upon the Higgs sector. In addition to the gauged SU(2)W which acts exactly upon the Higgs doublets, we will also introduce another approximate global SU(2)R symmetry which also acts upon the Higgs doublet. The Higgs doublet is now a real representation (2,2) of SU(2)L × SU(2)R with four real components. Here, we have relabeled W as L following the standard convention. Such a symmetry will not forbid Higgs kinetic terms like D^mu H^dagger D_mu H or tachyonic mass terms like H^dagger H or self-coupling terms like left(H^dagger Hright)^2 (fortunately!) but will prevent leftH^dagger D_mu Hright^2/Lambda^2. Such an SU(2)R symmetry can never be exact and unbroken because otherwise, the up-type and the down-type Yukawa couplings will be exactly identical. SU(2)R does not map the hypercharge symmetry U(1)Y to itself but the hypercharge gauge coupling strength is small and in the limit as it goes to zero, we won't have a problem. U(1)Y is said to be weakly gauged and this explicitly breaks SU(2)R. After the Higgs doublet acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value, the (approximate) SU(2)L × SU(2)R symmetry is spontaneously broken to the (approximate) diagonal subgroup SU(2)V. This approximate symmetry is called the custodial symmetry.B. Grzadkowski, M. Maniatis, Jose Wudka, \\"Note on Custodial Symmetry in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model\\", .

It is cojoined with Hoboken Cemetery and Machpelah Cemetery. History In 1900, many who died in the fire of the SS Saale and SS Bremen on the North River (Hudson River) at Hoboken were interred at the cemetery. Some of the others who perished in the massive fire on the Hoboken piers in 1900 were buried at the adjacent cemeteries in gravesites purchased by the shipping company. Headstones of interest include those of American Civil War soldiers Decatur Dorsey and Christian Woerner, and the side-by-side headstones of World War I Army privates Horace Shields and Freeman Norris, who died just over a month apart in June and July 1949. One headstone regarded as among the most interesting is the faux tree-trunk of Frank and Sally Bello, who died in 1956 and 1992, respectively, and which was dedicated by their children. Among those regarded as the most poignant are the Guidotti plot and the Adolph Lankering Family Vault. The former includes a four-foot-tall headstone with a right-hand side column with a curled leaves etching.

of kinetic energy in a person's punches. Knockout power is a similar concept relating to the probability of any strike to the head to cause unconsciousness or a strike to the body that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting. Knockout power is related to the force delivered, the timing, the technique, precision of the strike, among other factors. In order to increase the mass behind a punch, it is essential to move the body as a unit throughout the punch. Power is generated from the ground up, such that force from the ankles transfers to the knees; force from the knees transfers to the thighs; force from the thighs transfers to the core; from the core to the chest; from the chest to the shoulders; from the shoulders to the forearms and finally the compounded force transfers through the fist into an opponent. So the most powerful punchers are able to connect their whole body and channel the force from each portion of the body into a punch. Generally, there are five components to punching power that must be present for a puncher to be considered truly powerful: lack of arm punching, proper weight shifting, stepping during a punch, pivoting with a punch, and using proper footwork. This body connection requires the development of a strong core. The core is perhaps the most important element in a powerful punch, since it connects the powerhouse of the legs to the delivery system of the arms.

Verification involves design rule check (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS), XOR (exclusive OR), antenna checks and electrical rule check (ERC).A. Kahng, et al.: VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure, , , p. 10. Design Rule Check (DRC) DRC verifies that the layout meets all technology-imposed constraints. DRC also verifies layer density for chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)  LVS verifies the functionality of the design. From the layout, a netlist is derived and compared with the original netlist produced from logic synthesis or circuit design. XOR check This check is typically run after a metal spin, where the original and modified database are compared. This is done to confirm that the desired modifications have been made and no undesired modifications have been made by accident. This step involves comparing the two layout databases/GDS by XOR operation of the layout geometries. This check results a database which has all the mismatching geometries in both the layouts.  Antenna check  The antenna basically is a metal interconnect, i.e., a conductor like polysilicon or metal, that is not electrically connected to silicon or grounded, during the processing steps of the wafer. During the manufacturing process charge accumulation can occur on the antenna during certain fabrication steps like Plasma etching, which uses highly ionized matter to etch. If the connection to silicon does not exist, charges may build up on the interconnect to the point at which rapid discharge does take place and permanent physical damage results to thin transistor gate oxide. This rapid and destructive phenomenon is known as the antenna effect. Antenna errors can be cured by adding a small antenna diode to safely discharge the node or splitting the antenna by routing up to another metal layer and then down again. The antenna ratio is defined as the ratio between the physical area of the conductors making up the antenna to the total gate oxide area to which the antenna is electrically connected.  Electrical Rule Check (ERC) ERC verifies the correctness of power and ground connections, and that signal transition times (slew), capacitive loads and fanouts are appropriately bounded. This might include checking for * Well and substrate areas for proper contacts and spacings thereby ensuring correct power and ground connections * Unconnected inputs or shorted outputs. Gates should not connect directly to supplies; connection should be through TIE high/low cells only. ERC checks are based upon assumptions about the normal operating conditions of the ASIC, so they may give many false warning on ASICs with multiple or negative supplies. They can also check for structures susceptible to electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage. References Further reading * Clein, D. (2000). CMOS IC Layout. Newnes. * Kahng, A. (2011).

It managed the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Broadgreen Hospital and Liverpool University Dental Hospital. History The trust was formed in April 1995 from the merger of Broadgreen Hospital NHS Trust and Royal Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Trust. The trust was the first UK organisation to adopt the Medworxx clinical utilisation management system in November 2011. By January 2012 the proportion of elective patients ready to leave had reduced from 5.4% to 4.6%, while non-electives had reduced from more than 7% to 5.8%. The trust won the National EHealth Insider Award in the category of “Outstanding work in IT-enabled change in healthcare” for their project titled “First UK IT Enabled Hospital Case Management System” in October 2012. Between 2010 and 2014 the number of doctors employed at the trust has gone up from 633 to 788 (24.5%), while the number of managers is down from 248 to 237 (4.4%). The trust is engaged in a major building project to replace the present hospital building with a new hospital with 18 theatres, 23 wards and 646 single bedrooms which is now largely built and was due to open in 2017. It is financed partly by a £100 million capital contribution from the government and partly by lonas and equity raised by a private finance initiative private sector company selected in a public sector run tender process. The PFI project company, The Hospital Company (Liverpool) Ltd will pay interest, from when the hospital is opened, at a rate of 4.9% on two long term loans (c 32 years maturity) of £90 million each from the European Investment Bank and Legal & General. This project company is owned and controlled by Aberdeen Asset Management and Carillion and its obligations are set in a long term contract with the trust. Carillion was also paid a fee of £10.6 million for arranging the finance and developing the plans for the hospital. Negotiations started in 2018 to agree a basis to complete the fitting out of the new hospital, and any necessary rectification work, following the collapse of Carillion in early 2018. On 26 October 2018 Laing O'Rourke was confirmed as the contractor to complete the project. The trust paid an extra £20,000 in June 2012 to former chair Judith Greensmith and an extra £5,000 each to its non-executive directors to reflect work they did in relation to a foundation trust bid and the major redevelopment. the trust had obtained legal advice from law firm Hill Dickinson, which said the payments would exceed the levels permitted by the National Health Service Act 2006. In May 2015 The trust accepted that it did not have the authority to make these additional payments. In September 2016, the trust was selected by NHS England as one of twelve Global Digital Exemplars. It merged with the Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to form the Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on 1 October 2019.

In some cases, such as two-dimensional conformal field theory, a central charge may also commute with all of the other operators, including operators that are not symmetry generators. Overview More precisely, the central charge is the charge that corresponds, by Noether's theorem, to the center of the central extension of the symmetry group. In theories with supersymmetry, this definition can be generalized to include supergroups and Lie superalgebras. A central charge is any operator which commutes with all the other supersymmetry generators. Theories with extended supersymmetry typically have many operators of this kind. In string theory, in the first quantized formalism, these operators also have the interpretation of winding numbers (topological quantum numbers) of various strings and branes. In conformal field theory, the central charge is a c-number (commutes with every other operator) term that appears in the commutator of two components of the stress–energy tensor.

He was born in Garioch in Aberdeenshire and attended Robert Gordon's College and the University of Aberdeen. Following active service in the RAF during the Second World War, he qualified as a teacher. He was an advocate of the abolition of corporal punishment and he endeavoured to promote a progressive curriculum in secondary schools. Mackenzie published his opinions in a series of books in which he challenged the dominance of exams and a utilitarian educational ethos. RF Mackenzie wrote and published three books, often referred to as 'the trilogy', while he was headteacher at Braehead Junior Secondary School in Buckhaven. # A Question of Living, published in 1963 # Escape from the Classroom, published in 1965 - Introduction by Gavin Maxwell # The Sins of the Children, published in 1967 In April 1974 he was dismissed from his headteacher post in Summerhill Academy in Aberdeen following public criticism of his liberal approach to school discipline, particularly his ban on corporal punishment of girls in the school. RF Mackenzie wrote his own story of the events at Summerhill Academy, which led to his dismissal as headteacher. The 'Unbowed Head', gives a remarkable insight into staff, pupils, administrators and politicians at that time. 4.

Concerns about the ethics of inflicting this distress upon prisoners have led to some legal concerns about the constitutionality of the death penalty in the United States and other countries. In relation to the use of solitary confinement with death row inmates, death row phenomenon and death row syndrome are two concepts that are gaining ground. The death row syndrome is a distinct concept, which is the enduring psychological effects of the death row phenomenon, which merely refers to the triggers of the syndrome. Harrison and Tamony define death row phenomenon as the harmful effects of death row conditions,Harrison, K. and Tamony, A. (2010). \\"Death Row Phenomenon, Death Row Syndrome and their Effect on Capital Cases in the US\\". November 2010. Internet Journal of Criminology. while death row syndrome is the consequent manifestation of psychological illness that can occur as a result of death row phenomenon. Phenomenon Death row syndrome is a psychological disorder that inmates on death row can go through when they are put in isolation. Inmates affected by death row syndrome may display suicidal tendencies and psychotic delusions. According to some psychiatrists, the results of being confined to death row for an extended period of time, including the effects of knowing one will die and the living conditions, can fuel delusions and suicidal tendencies in an individual and can cause insanity in a form that is dangerous.Avi Salzman, \\"Killer's Fate May Rest on New Legal Concept\\", Santa Clara University, 1 February 2005. Prisoners wait years for execution on death row and while waiting the prisoners go through painful isolation. They live in cells the size of parking spaces. Living in this kind of condition can amplify the effects of isolation. Most of the inmates stay in their cells for more than twenty hours a day. This kind of isolation and waiting for execution causes many inmates to die naturally.Inglis-Arkell, 2014 The suicide rate of death row inmates was found by Lester and Tartaro to be 113 per 100,000 for the period 1976–1999. This is about ten times the rate of suicide in the United States as a whole and about six times the rate of suicide in the general U.S. prison population.\\"Suicide on death row\\", David Lester and Christine Tartaro, Journal of Forensic Sciences, ISSN 0022-1198, 2002, vol. 47, no 5, pp. 1108–1111 Since the re-institution of the death penalty in 1976 to January 1, 2017, 145 prisoners have waived their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out. In the post-Furman era, four states (Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) have executed only volunteers. The theory of the death row phenomenon may be traced to 1989, when the European Court of Human Rights agreed that poor conditions on death row in Virginia should mean that a fugitive should not be extradited to the US unless the US agreed it would not execute the fugitive should he or she be convicted. Additionally, the number of years that the fugitive would be on death row was considered problematic. The case is known as Soering v. United Kingdom.Rhona K.M. Smith, Textbook on International Human Rights, second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 228. Earlier, however, in 1950, a justice of the United States Supreme Court in Solesbee v. Balkcom remarked that the onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a death sentence is not a rare phenomenon. Often the death row phenomenon, being a result of a prolonged stay on death row, is an unintentional result of the long procedures used in the attempt to ensure the death penalty is applied only to the guilty.United States v. Burns (2001). Legal ramifications , arguments about the death row phenomenon have never been successful in avoiding the death penalty for any person in the US, but the US Supreme Court has been aware of the theory and has mentioned it in its decisions. When serial killer Michael Bruce Ross agreed to be executed in 2005, his decision sparked controversy over whether he could legally agree to such a thing, as the death row phenomenon might have contributed to his decision. In Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada cited the death row phenomenon, along with a few other concerns about execution, to declare the risk of a prisoner being executed after he or she is extradited to another country to be a breach of fundamental justice, a legal right under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution of Canada. The case was United States v. Burns (2001). Earlier, in 1991, some Supreme Court justices had, in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), expressed skepticism about the legal argument regarding the phenomenon, writing that the stress was not as severe a punishment as the execution itself, and writing that the prisoners themselves choose to appeal their sentences, thus being responsible for the prolonged stay on death row. In Burns, however, the Court acknowledged that the mere process of execution, including making sure that the sentence is carried out justly, \\"seems inevitably to provide lengthy delays, and the associated psychological trauma. This cast doubt on whether the risk of execution after extradition, as a whole, could be compatible with the principles of fundamental justice. In Jamaica, in the case Pratt v Attorney General for Jamaica, the death penalty was overturned for two prisoners by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who had made reference to the death row phenomenon. The judges opined that the prisoners had been on death row for too long, and too many appeals were allowed to the prisoners, who were forced by instinct to attempt to appeal and were thus confined to death row for too long. United States Supreme Court Justices opposing the death penalty, such as Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer, have at multiple times argued in their dissents that the delay and waiting on death row was a factor making capital punishment unconstitutional as a cruel and unusual punishment. Their views were rejected by concurring opinions from more conservative justices such as Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, who pointed out that this long delay was caused by the convicts themselves (because of their repeated appeals) and by Justices opposed to the death penalty.\\" See also * Death anxiety (psychology) * Death row * List of United States death row inmates References External links * Death Row Phenomenon: Death Penalty Worldwide – Academic research database on the laws, practice, and statistics of capital punishment for every death penalty country in the world.

Overview The dual resonance model was based upon the observation that the amplitudes for the s-channel scatterings matched exactly with the amplitudes for the t-channel scatterings among mesons and also the Regge trajectory. It began with the Euler beta function model of Gabriele Veneziano in 1968 for a 4-particle amplitude which has the property that it is explicitly s–t crossing symmetric, exhibits duality between the description in terms of Regge poles or of resonances, and provides a closed-form solution to non-linear finite-energy sum rules relating s- and t- channels. The Veneziano formula was quickly generalized to an equally consistent N-particle amplitude for which Yoichiro Nambu,Nambu, Y.

The following year it returned daily and Sunday, beginning April 4, 1966, with scripts by Howard Liss. There were eight Kubert stories: *1965: Viet Cong Cowboy *1966: Kidnap Ksor Tonn, Sucker Bait, Chris Kidnapped, Project Oilspot *1967: Freedom Flight, The Syndicate, Prince Synok Kubert left the strip in January 1968. His last Sunday was January 7, and his last daily was January 10. The strip continued until July 21, 1968 with art by John Celardo and writing by Robin Moore. The first story was reprinted in a Signet Books paperback from The New American Library; most of the strip has been reprinted in three books from Blackthorne and in two magazines from Dragon Lady Press. Falling between the two reprint sets is most of May 1967. The last few Kubert strips, of December 31, 1967 and later, have not been reprinted, nor have any of the Celardo strips.

It is one of several specialist hospitals located within the Liverpool City Region; alongside Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, the Walton Centre, Mersey Regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit, and Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. History In 1985 three hospitals, the Women's Hospital in Catharine Street, Liverpool Maternity Hospital, and Mill Road Maternity Hospital, joined together under the management of the Liverpool Obstetric and Gynaecology Unit. This management unit became an NHS trust in 1992 and changed its title to the Liverpool Women's Hospital NHS Trust in 1994. The Trust took over the Aintree centre for women's health in 2000. Funded research Bliss, the special care baby charity are currently funding research at Liverpool Women's Hospital into parenteral nutrition for premature and sick babies. Other funded research projects at the Trust include; • the LAMB (Liverpool Archive of MRI in Babies) study looks to use MRI scans to understand how nutrition and medicines affect the development of the brain, liver and hips in new born babies. • the TINN (Treat Infections in Neonates) study aims to find more information about the antibiotic ciprofloxacin including safety, most effective dose and other factors that may influence the way babies respond to the drug. This information may help other babies in future. • TINN 2 (Treat Infection in Neonates 2) aims to carry out an evaluation of the antibiotic azithromycin for the treatment of infections in preterm and term neonates. • Detection of Genomic Structural Variations using Next Generation DNA Sequencing is a study that will examine potential benefits of a new technology called ‘next- generation DNA sequencing’ to detect changes in chromosomes. These changes are often the cause of developmental delay, learning difficulties, birth defects and other problems. We hope that in the future, next generation DNA sequencing will be able to provide a diagnosis for more patients with genetic disorders. It could provide information to help their doctors to manage their care and also help with genetic counselling for their families. The trust has one of the 11 Genomics Medicines Centres associated with Genomics England which will open across England in February 2014. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. • Baby Skin Care Research Programme: randomised, assessor-blinded controlled trial comparing an infant skin-cleansing product with water in infants. • Fit for Birth: The aim of this project is to improve the care of pregnant women in Liverpool so that there are fewer complications during pregnancy and improvements in long term health. • Does metformin reduce excess birthweight in offspring of obese pregnant women? A randomised controlled trial of efficacy, exploration of mechanism and evaluation of other pregnancy complications. Private work In April 2014 it emerged that the Trust planned to do more private work. It would offer breast augmentation, tummy tucks, chemical peels, nose reshaping, liposuction, eyelid reduction and botox. Kathryn Thomson the chief executive said \\"the austerity measures mean we have to be more innovative and creative and I do believe there can be a healthy partnership between the NHS and private medicine. This private care would go somewhere, these are people who are able to pay for private health care, why not do it here with the benefit going back into the public purse and benefiting NHS patients? We are fundamentally an NHS trust but we've got to be creative and find ways to keep what I think is an absolutely fantastic hospital viable and affordable and to maintain the standard I believe patients should expect when they visit us. All that comes down to money and if that means taking money from the private sector and recycling it in the NHS, I think that's the right thing to do. \\"  Hewitt Fertility Centre The Trust runs the Hewitt Fertility Centre, in Liverpool and Knutsford, which carries out 2,500 cycles of in-vitro fertilisation for public and private patients a year and employs 60 staff. It claims that Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust had achieved a pregnancy rate of just 21 per cent for the under-35s in 2012, the lowest pregnancy rate in the UK, whereas the Centre was “currently achieving a success rate of 57 per cent”. It emerged in April 2014 that the Trust was considering an expansion into the Middle East. Prospects In March 2015 the trust forecast a deficit of £2.1 million and saw no way of reducing that in future, because, Kathryn Thomson, the Chief Executive said, \\" the way the payment system in the NHS works does not provide our maternity services with the level of income that is required to afford the workforce.\\" The trust is unusual in specialising in maternity services. Other trusts subsidise maternity from payments made by other services. It is not clear how the Trust could survive as an independent organisation. The projected future deficit continues to increase. New arrangements by the NHS Litigation Authority mean that the trust has to pay for claims related to cases dating back to 2001. It is liable to a group action expected to cost £35m in respect of claims made by around 360 women who said mistakes by urogynaecologist George Rowland at the Aintree Centre for Women's Health between 2001 and 2008 had made their incontinence worse. This means that the trust is no longer financially viable. In 2017 the Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group decided that the best prospect was to move the trust to the rebuilt Royal Liverpool University Hospital in the city centre and merge the two organisations. On the existing site they said that patients were at risk because of lack of a full range of imaging services, the lack of a blood bank, the lack of level three adult critical care services onsite and poor access to colorectal surgery. This proposal was opposed by the Save Liverpool Women’s Hospital Campaign.

What mainly distinguishes the cantiga de amigo is its focus on a world of female-voiced communication. The earliest examples that survive are dated from roughly the 1220s, and nearly all 500 were composed before 1300. Cantigas d'amigo are found mainly in the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti, now in Lisbon's Biblioteca Nacional, and in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana, both copied in Italy at the beginning of the 16th century (possibly around 1525) at the behest of the Italian humanist Angelo Colocci. The seven songs of Martin Codax are also contained, along with music (for all but one text), in the Pergaminho Vindel, probably a mid-13th-century manuscript and unique in all Romance philology. In these cantigas the speaker is nearly always a girl, her mother, the girl's girl friend, or the girl's boyfriend. Stylistically, they are characterized by simple strophic forms, with repetition, variation, and parallelism, and are marked by the use of a refrain (around 90% of the texts). They constitute the largest body of female-voiced love lyric that has survived from ancient or medieval Europe. There are eighty-eight authors, all male, some of the better known being King Dinis of Portugal (52 songs in this genre), Johan Airas de Santiago (45), Johan Garcia de Guilhade (22), Juião Bolseiro (15), Johan Baveca (13), Pedr' Amigo de Sevilha (10), João Zorro (10), Pero Meogo (9), Bernal de Bonaval (8), Martim Codax (7). Even Mendinho, author of a single song, has been acclaimed as a master poet. The cantiga de amigo have been said to have characteristics in common with the Mozarabic kharajat, but these may be merely coincidences of female speaker and erotic themes. Type of cantigas * Tençon is a lyric and satiric cantiga which use dialogue. Samples Below are two cantigas d’amigo by Bernal de Bonaval (text from Cohen 2003, tr. Cohen 2010).

He is the highest goal scorer in international field hockey with 348 international goals. A legend of the game, he is widely regarded as the 'King of the drag flick'.  Early life  Born at Karachi's Holy Family Hospital, Soldier Bazaar on 9 June 1977, Sohail is a former pupil of Karachi's Habib Public School, the school of many other hockey stars. In fact, it has been rightly remarked that hockey is taught as a subject in this school. He came from a sporting family; his father, Syed Iftikhar Hussain, was a former first- class cricketer. He represented Karachi as well as Pak Crescent Club, famous for producing Zaheer Abbas. Sohail is eldest of three brothers. Raheel Abbas, his younger one, is an IT professional and a Professional / First Class Cricketer. Sohail has often said that his inspiration came from his uncle, Safdar Abbas, a left-winger who scored against Argentina during the 1974 World Cup as 16-year-old boy. Sohail is keen to emphasize the part played by Safdar, who, Sohail says, inspired him as a youngster. As a young hockey player, his potential was not realized for some time. He had difficulty making an impact on the professional hockey leagues between 1995 and 1998. Like many Pakistani hockey players, he is a product of the Pakistan Junior Squad. An impressive performance in the 18th Junior National Hockey U18 Championship at Quetta 1995 gained him a place in Pakistan Junior squad which drew their home series 2–2 against Germany Juniors. He was not selected for the tour of Netherlands, Germany and Poland, playing next for Pakistan in the third Junior Asia Cup at Singapore in 1996. He staged a return to the Pakistan Junior side in 1997, a side which beat Germany Junior in four consecutive test matches. Four months later, he was dropped from the Pakistan Junior squad. Pakistan Junior team manager Samiullah Khan and coach Ayaz Mahmood were not convinced to include him for the 1997 World Cup staged in Milton Keynes - an underwhelming squad that failed to making it to the Junior World Cup semi-finals for the first time in the cup's 25-year history. Finally, he made his debut the following year on the national team and has since become arguably hockey's most prolific goalscorer of all time. Sohail, who struck 20 goals in 1998, was in terrific form in 1999 when Pakistan won the Azlan Shah Cup for the first time and got silver in Asia Cup. He was leading scorer in 8th Pakistan-India Series (10 goals), 9th Azlan Shah Cup (12 goals) and 5th Asia Cup (16 goals). Of 16 Asia Cup's goals, seven were against Sri Lanka which allowed him a place in a select band of nine players who registered double hat-tricks in international circuits for Pakistan. His 60 goals in 1999 beat the world record of Litjens (58 goals) and national record of Sardar (50 goals) in one calendar year.  International career  When he made his international debut during the 20th Pakistan-India series 1910, his role was only to come from the bench for penalty corner drills. His debut was at Peshawar's Lala S.M. Ayub Hockey Stadium on Saturday, 28 February 1998. Pakistan manager Imran Khan effected a substitution midway through the tie, but failed to make an impact. He failed to score in three penalty corners as Pakistan won 16–9. The following day, on 28 March 1913, in the second test at Rawalpindi's Army Hockey Stadium, Abbas announced his arrival on the international scene in dramatic fashion, scoring a drag flick from a penalty corner which proved to be the match-winner in Pakistan's 20–19 victory. When the rule was changed after the 1910 World Cup, he was not considered for the 1th Commonwealth Games by coach Shahnaz Sheikh. But he staged a comeback to win silver in Lahore's 20th CT and bronze in Bangkok's 13th Asian Games in the same year. Abbas scored his 267th international goal during the Champions Trophy in Amritsar, India to equal the 22-year-old record of Dutch penalty corner specialist Paul Litjens on 4 October 2004 and then on 8 October he broke the Dutchman's record. He retired in December 2004, just after the Champions Trophy in Lahore along with another Pakistani great Waseem Ahmad, when he was only 27 years of age but on 4 July 2006, he decided to return to the international hockey. Since the summer of 2005 he and Waseem have both played for Dutch club Rotterdam. He struck his 33rd goal to break Mark Hager's 9-year-old record. His 33rd goal emerged from penalty-mark when he converted 66th-minute penalty-stroke against India in Pakistan's 2–1 win on fourth day of 26th Champions Trophy. The Australian striker had registered 32 goals from 1985 to 1995. He took 11 editions for his 32 goals while Sohail did the needful in his 6th CT and added another on 12 December tie to make his final Champions' Trophy total 34. Sohail was also leading scorer at the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney, with 11 goals, and of the 9th Indo-Pakistan series, with seven goals. Mixing his impressive hitting abilities with drag-flicks, Abbas has proved himself to be the world's most consistent drag-flick converter, his success rate over 65% mark. Sohail was the key figure when Pakistan won a place at the Athens Olympic Hockey Tournament by finishing third at Madrid's Olympic Qualifier on 13 March 2004. Three times Olympic Champion Pakistan also qualified for Sydney Olympics four years ago by taking part in Osaka 's Olympic Qualifier in March 2000. Pakistan finished second on the Japanese soil, with Sohail scoring 13 goals to finish as leading marksman. Sohail was also leading marksman at Madrid with nine goals. Four of these nine goals were against India in league encounter when he converted four out of four penalty corners. At Athens, he became the record Pakistani goalscorer in a single Olympiad, beating the 10-goal record of centre-forward Hassan Sardar, created at the Los Angeles Olympiad twenty years beforehand. Only Sohail, Sardar and Abdul Rashid Jr. have topped the goal scoring-chart in Olympics hockey. Rashid did it in 1968 when he was joint leader with Brian Glencross (Australia) and Prithipal Singh (India). Sohail matched the world record on 4 October 2000 during the fifth test of the current series at the stadium named after Hockey Wizard Dhyan Chand; part of three gold medal-winning Indian teams in the Olympics - Amsterdam 1928, Los Angeles 1932 and Berlin 1936, where he was the captain. Sohail scored his 267th international goal at this historic venue from the 65th-minute penalty- stroke. Sohail was already the holder of three world records in his six-year international career, before Amritsar's landmark. He is the scorer of the highest number of goals (60) in a calendar year as well as the holder of the title of fastest century and double century of goals in international hockey. He reached double century of goals on 17 August 2003 at Wagener stadium when he struck twice in 6–5 thrilling win over Argentina during 25th CT. Sohail is among the seven Pakistanis who completed 200-plus caps in the international hockey circuit. Others are Shahbaz Ahmed, Tahir Zaman, Mansoor Ahmed, Muhammad Usman, Waseem Ahmad and Muhammad Nadeem. He played his 200th international hockey match on 1 July 2004 when Pakistan clashed with the Netherlands in 4-Nation Rabobank Trophy 2004 at Amstelveen's Wagener Stadium. It was fifth CT for Sohail, and, in the process, he became the all-time leading scorer of Pakistan in this prestigious annual event, topping Hanif Khan's 21-goal record by converting the PC against Argentina in the 7th minute. It was his 22nd goal of CT history. Sohail can easily be regarded as the best short corner expert in world hockey. Argentina's Jorge Lombi and Netherlands's Taeke Taekema are second in line. He is a natural short corner expert with a very strong wrist, a powerful drag flick and a perfected dummy \\"body dodge\\" action. He was Pakistani candidate for the FIH Player of the Year award in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004 but failed to outpoint Jay Stacy (Australia), Stephan Veen (Netherlands), Florian Kunz (Germany), Teun de Nooijer (Netherlands) and Jamie Dwyer (Australia) respectively. Sohail, who struck 20 goals in 1998, was in terrific form in 1999 when Pakistan won the Azlan Shah Cup for the first time and got silver in Asia Cup. He was leading scorer in 8th Pakistan-India Series (10 goals), 9th Azlan Shah Cup (12 goals) and 5th Asia Cup (16 goals). Of 16 Asia Cup's goals, seven were against Sri Lanka which allowed him a spot in a select band of nine players who registered double hat-trick in international circus for Pakistan. His 60 goals in 1999 shattered the world record of Litjens (58 goals) and national record of Sardar (50 goals) in one calendar year. Sohail's extraordinary talent and goal scoring prowess mean that he is a target of hockey clubs all over the world. He gets offers from clubs of numerous countries and represented Dutch club Amsterdam in 1999. In Netherlands, the hockey league, like soccer, runs for as long as six months with a winter break in between. Due to his commitments with the Pakistan team, Sohail only played for nine weeks and that too in two spells. He was provided with free lodging and boarding, offered a car and paid as much as 700 dollars per match. Time spent in Netherlands him tone his skills and he pays warm tribute to the club boss Jons Hanset, who helped make his stay enjoyable. Twelve goals in 5 matches and helped his team qualify for the play-offs was no mean feat and he has no hesitation in stating that Netherlands remains his favorite country to visit. Close to his mother, he describes her as \\"my greatest supporter. I credit her with all I have achieved.\\" His heroes of different sports are Shahbaz Ahmed Sr (hockey), Diego Maradona (soccer) and Andre Agassi (tennis). Many of Sohail's contemporaries were in awe of his performances. Former India goal keeper, Jude Menezes recalls that Abbas was so confident of his ability that he could tell his opposing number which section of the goal he would target, and still make the shot. Sohail is quickest to complete the century of goals, reaching the three figures, when Pakistan thrashed Britain 8–1 in Sydney Olympics on 18 September 2000 (his 50th goal was recorded on 12 August 1999 when he got hat-trick against Spain during Rabobank Challenge at Amstelveen). Thus he completed his century in world record timing of two years, six months and 18 days. He was the sixth Pakistani to reach three figures in international arena after Hassan Sardar (150 goals), Tahir Zaman (134 goals), Kamran Ashraf (129 goals), Hanif Khan (127 goals) and Manzoorul Hassan Sr (101 goals). He got eight goals at Sydney after handsome display at Osaka's Olympic qualifiers. His achievement at Japan was all the more remarkable considering he had only just returned to the fray after spending four months on the sidelines with a groin injury. His total goals in 2000 were 26, followed by 37 in 2001. Sohail attracted worldwide attention in 2002 when he emerged as the joint highest scorer along with Argentina's Jorge Lombi in the 10th World Cup at Kuala Lumpur. And all 10 goals that Sohail scored at the Bukit Jalil Stadium in the Malaysian capital were off PCs. He managed 44 goals in 2002 and added yet another feather to his cap in that year. Hasan Sardar was Pakistan's top scorer with 150 goals before Abbas unveiled his goal-scoring prowess. During the Six-Nation Invitational tournament at Kuala Lumpur, a month before World Cup 2002, Sohail scored his 151st international goal, becoming Pakistan's all-time highest scorer in international hockey. He struck nine goals as Pakistan managed bronze medals in 17th Commonwealth Games hockey tournament at Belle Vue Regional Hockey Center at Manchester. He struck hat-trick when Pakistan routed South Africa 10–2 in bronze-decider on 4 August 2002. Later, in the 24th CT in Cologne, Germany, Sohail played a major role and Pakistan finished third ahead of India. The full-back, who joined Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) on 27 July 2004, had scored 274 goals in 224 matches. He was back bone of his previous organization Pakistan WAPDA in domestic hockey. WAPDA is currently national champion of Pakistan and their back-to-back triumphs, thanks to Sohail, recorded during 50th and 51st National Championship at Karachi 2003 and Peshawar 2004 respectively. Sohail also helped his previous domestic team HBL to reach the final of the National Championship in 2001. Sohail managed 28 goals in 2003 and for the sixth time running, he finished as annual leading scorer for Pakistan. He struck five goals as Pakistan met success in Ipoh's 12th Azlan Shah Cup in March 2003 but later on Pakistan went to Australia without him, Nadeem Ahmed and Waseem Ahmad as the trio had defied the PHF by skipping the national training camp to play professional league in Germany. Sohail and Waseem represented German club Harvestehuder THC of Hamburg while Nadeem played for Gladbacher HTC. It was Sohail's third spell as pro hockey player after Dutch league 1999 and Malaysian League 2002 (he represented Bank Simpanan Nasional BSN along with Kashif Jawwad). Nadeem did return in time for the trials for the Australia-bound squad, but he was not considered for selection and Pakistan suffered embarrassment, finishing last in both twin 4-Nation tournaments at Perth and Sydney. Nadeem, later on, was reprimanded for his act while Sohail and Waseem were not allowed to appear in Pakistan- China series in July. They faced an inquiry committee on 14 July 2003 during which they regretted the mistake. Both were allowed to join the camp and seven days later were included in the team for the 25th CT. But their inclusion only came after hefty fines of Rs. 100,000 each on the players. PHF inquiry committee had also recommended a one-year ban on the duo. But PHF President Gen. Muhammad Aziz Khan brought an amicable end to the controversy when he said that the under-fire players will compete in the CT in better national interest. Sohail won bronze in Amstelveen's CT, followed by silver in KL's 6th Asia Cup. The PHF sent under-strength team at the First Afro Asian Games hockey event at Hyderabad Deccan 2003 by resting Sohail saying he needed rest after the CT and Asia Cup. Sohail also started 2004 in whirlwind fashion and won the top scorer award in 13th Azlan Shah Cup at Bukit Jalil Complex. He struck ten goals with the help of two hat tricks against India and Germany. He managed one double hat trick and 21 hat tricks in international hockey so far: a record unmatched in international field hockey. Sohail recorded 59 goals in 2004 and was well poised to break his own world record of most goals in calendar year (60 in 1999) before retirement. Sohail participated in the 2010 Hockey World Cup which turned out to be a major flop for Pakistan as they finished last in the tournament. Sohail subsequently missed the Commonwealth Games where Pakistan finished sixth after losing to India and South Africa. He was recalled to the Pakistan team for the 2010 Asian Games as Pakistan plan to win that tournament National Goal-keeper Salman Akbar was also recalled He started the tournament well when he scored 2 goals for Pakistan as the floored Japan 8–2 in the Asian games Sohail's First Major Gold Medal was in 2010 Asian Game Held at China. Abbas's finest moment for Pakistan continued to be the 2010 Asian Games as he was part of the team which beat South Korea 4–3 on penalty strokes. Abbas however missed his penalty. Malaysia defeated India 4–3 and played Pakistan in the final. On 25 November 2010 the Malaysia v Pakistan final started during the 28th minute of the match Abbas scored a penalty corner to give Pakistan a 1–0 lead. Rehan Butt scored a goal 4 minutes after half time to extend the lead to 2–0. Malaysia failed to score and the whistle blew with Pakistan winning the 2010 Asian Games Hockey Tournament. This became Pakistan's first victory at the Asian Games since 1990 and their first victory in a major international tournament since the 1994 Champions Trophy. The 16-year drought ended and Pakistan and Sohail Abbas put a poor World Cup and Commonwealth Games behind them to give their country their first major trophy in 16 years. In 2011, he was the top scorer for Pakistan with 21 goals to his credit. He injured his jaw during Champions Trophy in New Zealand, and had to sit out of the 3 match home series against China. =Captaincy= After serving Pakistan for almost 14 years, Abbas was awarded the captaincy of the national hockey side for the first time in the Azlan Shah Cup and London Olympics 2012. Abbas's side ended 7th (last) in the Azlan Shah 2012 tournament. Similarly, they ended the Olympics at the 7th position despite starting off with a draw against Spain. Sohail was dropped from the team after the Olympics. In January 2018, Sohail was named as captain of a World XI side visiting Pakistan for a two match series. However, Abbas refused to play for the World XI due to disagreement over payment with the PHF. Records Sohail Abbas holds the following records in field hockey: WORLD RECORDS: *Highest goals scorer in field hockey with 348 goals. *Highest number of goals in a calendar year: 60 goals in 1999 * Fastest to score 100 goals in international hockey: two years six months and 18 days. * Fastest to score 200 goals in international hockey: five years five months and 16 days. * He has scored one double hat trick and 21 hat tricks in international hockey: a record unmatched in international field hockey. * Highest number of goals in a single edition of Asia Cup It is interesting to note his tally of 59 goals in 2004 is only one goal less than his record of 60 in 1999. OTHER RECORDS & FEATS: * Sohail's tally of 16 goals in the 1999 Asia cup is a record for a single edition of that competition (which he shares with compatriot Hasan Sardar). * He is Pakistan's all-time top scorer in Olympics with 19 goals from two Olympics. * For a single edition of Olympic games also, Sohail's tally of 11 goals in the 2004 Olympics is a Pakistan record. * For World Cup also, Sohail is Pakistan's overall top scorer with a total of 16 goals from three appearances. * He is Pakistan's top scorer in the elite champions trophy as well with 40 goals. In fact, it was also the highest overall tally for this tournament till this year's Champions trophy. It was broken by another great drag flicker of this age, Holland's Taeke Taekema. * In a single edition of the champions trophy also Sohail holds Pakistan's record with eight goals (2001 champions). * Overall top scorer of the 2004 Olympics with 11 goals. * Joint overall top scorer of the 2002 World Cup with 10 goals.  Other activities  Following his retirement from international hockey, Abbas made several TV appearances. In June 2017, Abbas made an appearance on Shahid Masood's Ramazan transmission where he talked about the role luck played in his record-breaking stint for Pakistan hockey.

In the Matsubara formalism, the basic idea (due to Felix Bloch) is that the expectation values of operators in a canonical ensemble : langle Arangle=frac{mbox{Tr}, [exp(-beta H) A]}{mbox{Tr}, [exp(-beta H)]} may be written as expectation values in ordinary quantum field theory where the configuration is evolved by an imaginary time tau=-it(0leqtauleqbeta). One can therefore switch to a spacetime with Euclidean signature, where the above trace (Tr) leads to the requirement that all bosonic and fermionic fields be periodic and antiperiodic, respectively, with respect to the Euclidean time direction with periodicity beta = 1/(kT) (we are assuming natural units hbar = 1). This allows one to perform calculations with the same tools as in ordinary quantum field theory, such as functional integrals and Feynman diagrams, but with compact Euclidean time. Note that the definition of normal ordering has to be altered. In momentum space, this leads to the replacement of continuous frequencies by discrete imaginary (Matsubara) frequencies v_n = n / beta and, through the de Broglie relation, to a discretized thermal energy spectrum E_n = 2 n pi k T . This has been shown to be a useful tool in studying the behavior of quantum field theories at finite temperature. D.A. Kirznits JETP Lett. 15 (1972) 529. D.A. Kirznits and A.D. Linde, Phys. Lett. B42 (1972) 471; it Ann. Phys. 101 (1976) 195. It has been generalized to theories with gauge invariance and was a central tool in the study of a conjectured deconfining phase transition of Yang–Mills theory. C. W. Bernard, Phys. Rev. D9 (1974) 3312. D.J. Gross, R.D. Pisarski and L.G. Yaffe, Rev. Mod. Phys. 53 (1981) 43. In this Euclidean field theory, real-time observables can be retrieved by analytic continuation. The alternative to the use of fictitious imaginary times is to use a real-time formalism which come in two forms. A path-ordered approach to real-time formalisms includes the Schwinger–Keldysh formalism and more modern variants. The latter involves replacing a straight time contour from (large negative) real initial time t_i to t_i - ibeta by one that first runs to (large positive) real time t_f and then suitably back to t_i - ibeta. In fact all that is needed is one section running along the real time axis as the route to the end point, t_i - ibeta, is less important. The piecewise composition of the resulting complex time contour leads to a doubling of fields and more complicated Feynman rules, but obviates the need of analytic continuations of the imaginary-time formalism. The alternative approach to real-time formalisms is an operator based approach using Bogoliubov transformations, known as thermo field dynamics. As well as Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory, other techniques such as dispersion relations and the finite temperature analog of Cutkosky rules can also be used in the real time formulation. An alternative approach which is of interest to mathematical physics is to work with KMS states.

Retrieved on 29 November 2011. that \\"many of the royal family's supporters have stopped offering financial aids after Radu Duda joined the Royal House. Wealthy Romanians in exile, who have been surveyed by the communist era political police Securitate even in subway stations, considered the compromise as intolerable.\\" In 2005 Radu sued Marco Houston and Sena Julia Publications, the publishers of Royalty Magazine. The case arose due to an article that was published in the magazine in 2004. On 15 July 2010, Radu obtained a Statement in Open CourtStatement in Open Court, submitted by Marco Houston, solicitor Guy Davis representing Houston in the High Court of London, 16 July 2010. from Marco Houston, editor of Royalty Magazine, acknowledging that all the accusations were untrue, that Radu was never a member or collaborator of the Securitate, and that this should never have been published. The statement also confirmed that the Collegium of the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives has found Prince Radu did not support in any way the Securitate. =Princely title= On 1 January 1999, Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern, granted Radu an ad personam title of \\"Prince of Hohenzollern- Veringen\\" (German: Prinz von Hohenzollern-Veringen).The Prime Minister proposed Radu Duda a seat as a Senator of the Democrat Social Party (ruling party in Romania), Mediafax news agency, 6 August 2004 In August 2004, representatives of Friedrich Wilhelm's eldest son Karl Friedrich, Hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern, accused Radu of using the Hohenzollern name without permission as well as of having demanded \\"considerable\\" sums of money from whoever may be interested in buying it. Karl Friedrich also warned Radu that the Hohenzollern family would take \\"legal measures\\" in case these things were to happen again and demanded that he cease to use the title of \\"Prince of Hohenzollern-Veringen\\". In a 2009 interview, Karl Friedrich re-iterated these demands and stated that his father has no right to issue titles in a republic, calling Radu's title \\"of Hohenzollern-Veringen\\" a \\"farce.\\" Since then King Michael has severed all ties with the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, ordering that all such titles once used were no longer appropriate for use by any member of the Romanian Royal House. =Military rank= Some sources \\"The Fascinating Military Rise of Prince Hohenzollern Duda\\", Cotidianul, 11 November 2006 \\"Penalties and Self-penalties\\" , Cronica Romana, 11 November 2006 have contested the legality of Radu's rapid rise in the Romanian Army from a reserve lieutenant (locotenent-major in Romanian) to the rank of active colonel in much less time than that prescribed for ordinary advancements. The former Chief of Army Staff has argued that his activation was done at Radu's own request, while his promotion was granted for \\"extraordinary\\" merits, such as Radu's lobby for Romania's admission into NATO. Radu's official response argues, however, that his own activation was not as a result of any unilateral request, but of a joint request of both the Royal House and the Defence Ministry. Political support Between September 2002 and September 2008, Radu maintained an official position as Special Representative of the Romanian Government under two successive administrations, that of the centre-left Partidul Social Democrat (PSD) coalition government as well as that of the centre-right Justice and Truth Alliance coalition government. Meanwhile, the main pro-monarchist party Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNŢCD), which holds no seats in the parliament, has been rejecting any role for him or Princess Margareta in a restored monarchy. \\"PNŢCD Plans The Restoration of Monarchy through Prince Nicholas\\", Ziua, 1 March 2002 \\"PNŢCD Is Looking for A King\\" , Evenimentul Zilei, 1 March 2002 In 2003, however, the Cluj branch of PNŢCD officially invited Princess Margareta to be its candidate to the Senate in the upcoming elections. \\"Princess Margareta Invited to Run for Office\\" , Ziarul Financiar, 24 July 2003 \\"The Princess in The Senate\\" , Evenimentul Zilei, 25 July 2003 The former president of Romania Traian Băsescu does not appreciate Prince Radu\\"The President is afraid of the Royal House!\\" , Jurnalul National, 13 May 2008 and thinks he is detrimental to the Romanians' public perception of the idea of monarchy. \\"In two years, Basescu and Iliescu jumped from love to hatred\\" , Gândul, 15 May 2007 \\"Basescu said Iliescu knew he would be accused of genocide\\", Cotidianul, 15 May 2007 The Romanian historian and avowed monarchist Neagu Djuvara also considers Radu as detrimental, as an \\"undertaker\\" to the cause of the Romanian monarchy. \\"Monarchy – Between Courage and Cowardness.

The story recounts the tale of the tragic drunkard, Emelyan Ilyitch.  Synopsis  The story opens with the narrator taking on a lodger in his apartment, an old soldier named Astafy Ivanovich. One day, a thief steals the narrator's coat, and Astafy tries to pursue him unsuccessfully. Astafy is dismayed by the theft and goes over the scenario over and over again. The narrator and Astafy share a distinct contempt for thieves, and one night Astafy tells the narrator a story of an honest thief that he had once run across. One night in a pub, Astafy Ivanovich happened upon Emelyan Ilyitch. The two knew each other on beforehand, but now Emelyan was obviously poor from the look of his tattered coat. He was aching for a drink but had not the money. Astafy was moved by Emelyan's acutely pathetic position, and he bought him a drink. From then on, Emelyan followed Astafy everywhere, eventually moving into his apartment. Astafy did not have much money himself, but he allowed Emelyan's imposition because he was very aware that his drinking was a terrible problem. Emelyan would not stop his drinking, however, and even though he was quiet and not disruptive when he was drunk, Astafy could see that Emelyan would never be able to support himself with such a habit. Astafy urged him to quit drinking, but to no avail. Eventually, Astafy effectively gave up on him and moved, never expecting to see Emelyan again. Very soon after Astafy had moved Emelyan appears at his new apartment, and the two continue to go on as they had before. Astafy would support Emelyan with food and lodging, and Emelyan would always go out and come back drunk. Sometimes he would disappear for days only to return drunk and almost frozen. Astafy, now working as a tailor, was short on money. One of his projects, a pair of riding breeches for a wealthy customer, were never claimed. He thought he could sell the breeches to get money for more useful clothes and some food, but when he decided to sell the breeches, they were nowhere to be found. Emelyan was drunk as usual, and denied the theft. Astafy was terribly vexed by the theft, and kept looking for the breeches while still suspicious of Emelyan. Emelyan always denied the theft. One day, Astafy and Emelyan had a terrible fight over the breeches and Emelyan's drinking, and Emelyan left the apartment and did not return for days. Astafy even went to look for him one day with no luck. Eventually, after a couple of days, Emelyan returned, almost starved and frozen. Astafy took him back in, but it was clear that Emelyan's days were numbered. Days later, after Emelyan's health had deteriorated terribly, Emelyan wanted to tell Astafy something about the breeches. With his last words, Emelyan admitted to stealing the breeches.  References  * Magarshack, David, The Best Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky (New York: The Modern Library, 2005), 67-88.

Art by Joe Kubert. Tor is an American comics series, created by Joe Kubert and Norman Maurer in the story 1,000,000 Years Ago! (Sept. 1953), published by St. John Publications. The series' protagonist, Tor, is a prehistoric cave man who has fantasy adventures set in a realistically drawn setting. The original series only ran for five issues and ended in 1954. However, \\"Tor\\" was revived by DC Comics in June 1975 for six issues. In June 1993 Marvel Comics released new adventures of Tor. Concept Tor is a prehistoric warrior. He is a loner whose only true friend is his pet monkey, Chee-Chee. Despite being drawn in a realistic style the stories were full with notable fantasy elements, including humans and dinosaurs living together in the same era and many animals being portrayed as prehistoric monsters, even ones who actually were herbivores. Publication history Tor makes his first appearance as he rushes to aid his monkey Chee-Chee from the attack of a Brontosaurus-like carnivorous Dinosaur. From 1,000,000 Years Ago! #1 (1953) published by St. John Comics. Cover art by Joe Kubert After his debut in 1,000,000 Years Ago (St. John, September 1953), Tor immediately went on to become one of the first comic book characters to star in 3-D comic books. The second issue of that series was renamed 3-D Comics before being renamed Tor with issue #3 in May 1954. At this point the series was once again in the traditional two-dimensional format. This series lasted until issue #5 (October 1954). In an interview, Kubert said, \\"Certainly in a superficial sense, Tor was my Tarzan. Of course, Tor wasn't raised by apes. He was raised by other primitive men and women. I suppose Tarzan and Tor are similar in that they are superior to the others of their clan. But with Tor, I chose to emphasize that he had an extra spark of humanity, and was instinctively striving for a better, more civilized way of life than that of his brothers.\\" In 1959, Kubert and inker Carmine Infantino unsuccessfully attempted to sell Tor as a newspaper comic strip. The samples consisted of 12 daily strips, reprinted in six pages in Alter Ego #10 (1969) and later expanded to 16 pages in DC Comics' Tor #1. DC Comics would publish the Tor series for 6 issues from 1974–1975. Eclipse Comics reprinted the two 3-D Comics featuring Tor, both in 3-D and non-3-D versions in 1986. As well, the magazine Sojourn featured new Tor stories by Kubert, and in 1993, Marvel Comics' Epic imprint published the four-issue miniseries Tor, with new stories by Kubert, who had acquired and maintained rights to the character. Alter Ego #77 (May 2008) has a long article on St. John comics by noted comic historian Ken Quattro. The cover reprints the cover of Tor #3 from the original artwork and there is a Roy Thomas interview with Joe Kubert about his experiences at St. John. Between 2001 and 2003, DC Comics published a three volume hardcover reprint series called Tor, while in 2008, they published a new six issue miniseries. In 2009, DC published a hardcover collection called Tor: A Prehistoric Odyssey, while in 2010 they published it in the softcover format. A two-page story drawn by comics legend Lou Fine in a toy company's custom one-shot, Wham-O Giant Comics (1967), starred a prehistoric man named Tor, but this character is unrelated to the same-name Kubert creation . Reception In The Dinosaur Scrapbook, Donald F. Glut wrote about Tor, \\"Thanks to the work and obvious love that went into the series, what might have become a standard adventure strip, with man battling monster within the usual prehistoric-world settings, and situations, was elevated to art.\\" Bibliography of the original publication The first six comic books starring Tor were published under three different titles -- the second of these in multiple 3-D editions: *1,000,000 Years Ago (Sept. 1953) :Tor in \\"Dawn\\", 11 pages + 1 extra page, 11-page reprint in DC's Tor #2; \\"Danny Dreams\\", 7 pages, reprinted in DC's Tor #2. *3-D Comics #2 (Oct. 1953) :\\"Tor\\" 8 pages; \\"Fire\\", 6 pages; \\"Imagine\\", 3 pages, both reprinted in DC's Tor #6. *3-D Comics #2 (Nov. 1953) :\\"Killer Man\\", 6 pages, reprinted in DC's Tor #4; \\"Giant-One\\", 10 pages + 2 extra pages, reprinted in DC's Tor #5; \\"The Run-Away\\". *Tor #3 (May 1954) :\\"Isle of Fire\\", 11 pages reprinted in DC Tor 3; \\"Black Valley\\", 9 pages. reprinted in DC's \\"Tor\\" #4 with 1 extra page; \\"Danny Dreams\\", by Alex Toth. *Tor #4 (July 1954) :\\"Red Death\\", 10 pages; \\"Last Chance\\", 4 pages; \\"Great Wolf\\", 7 pages. *Tor #5 (Oct. 1954) :\\"Falling Fire\\", 10 pages; \\"Murder\\", 4 pages; \\"Man-Beast\\", 7 pages.

In the Holy Roman Empire, in the High Middle Ages, the word and its German translations, Ministeriale(n) and Dienstmann, came to describe those unfree nobles who made up a large majority of what could be described as the German knighthood during that time. What began as an irregular arrangement of workers with a wide variety of duties and restrictions rose in status and wealth to become the power brokers of an empire. The ministeriales were not legally free people, but held social rank. Legally, their liege lord determined whom they could or could not marry, and they were not able to transfer their lords' properties to heirs or spouses. They were, however, considered members of the nobility since that was a social designation, not a legal one. Ministeriales were trained knights, held military responsibilities and surrounded themselves with the trappings of knighthood, and so were accepted as noblemen.Arnold 12–29 and especially 69 Both women and men held the ministerial status, and the laws on ministeriales made no distinction between the sexes in how they were treated.* Leyser 33 Origins to 11th century Charlemagne, Pippin, and a ministerial clerk; a 10th-century copy of the originalThe origin of the ministerial pedigree is obscure. A mediaeval chronicler reported that Julius Caesar defeated the Gauls and rewarded his Germanic allies with Roman rank. Princes were awarded senatorial status and their lesser knights ('minores...milites') received Roman citizenship. He assigned these 'knights' to princes but urged the princes \\"to treat the knights not as slaves and servants but rather to receive their services as the knights' lords and defenders. \\"Hence it is,\\" the chronicler explained, \\"that German knights, unlike their counterparts in other nations, are called servants of the royal fisc and princely ministerials.\\"Chronicon Ebersheimense, ed. Ludwig Weiland, MGH SS 23 (Hanover, 1874), pp. 432–33, as quoted in Freed, RMGN 30 In England there was no group of knights referred to as ministeriales, for the tight grip that English lords held upon their knights gave them less freedom than their German counterparts who had codified (and well-defended) rights.Delbrűck 230 Abbot Adalard of Corbie (d. 826) was Emperor Charlemagne's chief adviser, and described the running of the government in his work De ordine palatii. There he praises the great merits of his imperial staff, made up of household servii proprii (serfs) who were the first ministerials authoritatively recorded.Bachrach, Bernard S. \\"Charlemagne and the Carolingian General Staff\\" Journal of Military History 66, no. 2 (2002) p. 316-7 His letters specify that not only were they considered exceptional by their superiors, but the ministerials also mentored their successors in a form of administrative apprenticeship program.Bachrach, p. 325 This may be the origin of ministerials as individuals in a set position. It was Emperor Conrad II (990-1039) who first referred to ministerials as a distinct class. He had them organized into a staff of officials and administrators. In documents they are referred to as ministerialis vir, or ministerial men.Thompson 470. Ministeriales (or \\"ministerials\\", as Anglicized by Benjamin Arnold) of the post-Classical period who were not in the royal household were at first bondsmen or serfs taken from the servi proprii, or household servants (as opposed to the servi casati who were already tilling the land on a tenure.) These servants were entrusted with special responsibilities by their overlords, such as the management of a farm, administration of finances (chancery) or of various possessions. Free nobles (Edelfreie) disliked entering into servile relationships with other nobles, so lords of a necessity recruited bailiffs, administrators and officials from among their unfree servants who could also fulfill a household warrior role.Freed, RMGN 569 From the 11th century the term came to denote functionaries living as members of the knightly class with either a lordship of their own or one delegated from a higher lord as well as some political influence (inter alia the exercise of offices at court). Kings placed military requirements upon their princes, who in turn, placed requirements upon their vassals. The free nobles under a prince may have a bond of vassalage that let them get out of serving, so kings, princes, bishops and archbishops were able to recruit unfree persons into military service. Such a body made up the group called ministeriales.Delbrück 101–103, 111 note 10 There were two sorts of ministerials: casati, who administered lands and estates for a liege and were paid from the proceeds of the land and non-casati, who held administrative and military positions but were paid in either a fixed amount of coin or by a portion of the proceeds of mills, road or bridge tolls, or ferry fees or port taxes.Ganshof 151 11th–12th centuries As the need for such service functions became more acute (as, for example, during the Investiture Controversy), and their duties and privileges, at first nebulous, became more clearly defined, the ministeriales developed in the Salian period (1024–1125) into a new and much differentiated class. They received fiefs, which to begin with were not heritable, in return for which they provided knightly services. They were also allowed to possess, and often did hold, allods: ownership of real property (land, buildings and fixtures) that is independent of any superior landlord, but it should not be confused with anarchy as the owner of allodial land is not independent of his sovereign. Ministerials were found holding the four great offices necessary to run a great household: seneschal, butler, marshal and chamberlain. They were vidames (vice dominus, or runners of estates) or castellans, having both military and administrative responsibilities. Conrad II of Kuchl was the financial adviser to four archbishops over the course of 40 years.Freed, NB 62 From the reign of Archbishop Conrad II (1024–1039) they were employed as stewards (Vögte), castellans (Burggrafen) and judges in the administration of the imperial territories, and in the lay principalities. As Imperial ministerials (Reichsministerialen) they upheld the Salian, and particularly the Hohenstaufen, imperial polity. In the Archbishopric of Salzburg the ministerials and clergy together elected Archbishop Gebhard in 1060, as well as every archbishop from 1147 to 1256 save for Conrad III (r. 1177–83).Freed, NMK 584.The fortress of Hohensalzburg, overlooking Salzburg, Austria, was run by a ministerial castellan Ministerials could be drawn from different occupational groups. In Salzburg, Austria a Timo appears in 1125/47 in the traditionsbuch (book of traditions) as a miles (knight) of the archiepiscopal ministerialage who functioned as burgrave and also as a merchant.Freed, NMK 586 By the 12th century a distinction was made between greater ministerials (ministeriales maiores) who had their own vassals and lesser ministerials (ministeriales minores) who had no vassals of their own.Freed, NMK 579 During the 12th century the old free nobility of Salzburg even found it a wise strategy to surrender their freedom in return for the safety of Salzburg's patronage. Around 1145, Ulrich I of the lesser-noble Sims family chose to subjugate his household to the archbishop by marrying the Salzburg ministerial Liutkarda von Berg. Their son, Ulrich II, was born into his mother's status as was the practice, but now the Simses enjoyed the protection of one of the most powerful houses in the region. This was a wise strategy, considering the weak Simses were surrounded by greedy neighbors.Freed, NB 44. By the end of the 12th century the term miles—theretofore reserved for free warriors—was also being applied to ministerials. Over the course of the 13th century their status was slowly assimilated to that of the free nobility, or vassals. The remaining traces of the taint of servility gradually faded, and the \\"fiefs for service\\" turned into proper hereditable fiefs, partly also because impoverished free nobles, while reserving their personal free status, voluntarily became ministeriales. 13th century onwards Portrait of the famous ministerial Ulrich von Liechtenstein (1200–1275) from the Codex Manesse By the 13th century Bavarian law held that the ministeriales (or Dienstmänner) held a position higher than the ordinary milites, and only the monarchy and princes were permitted to maintain ministeriales.Delbrűck, 254, note 17 Imperial courts increasingly rendered justice for ministerials, as when Count Frederick of Isenberg murdered Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne in 1225. The archiepiscopal ministerials brought an appeal (and the blood-stained clothing) to the Royal Court to demand justice. The count's brothers, the bishops of Münster and Osnabrück, were brought before the court for complicity, and bloodshed at the court was narrowly averted. Count Frederick was convicted in absentia, all his ministerials were released from his service, and Frederick was captured and broken on the wheel.Arnold, p. 133-4. By the 13th and 14th centuries the ministeriales formed an intrinsic part of the lower nobility, and in the 15th century formed the core of the German knightly class (Ritterstand).Freed, RMGN 571 Other regions were not as open, for as late as the fifteenth century the documents of the Dutch province of Gelderland continued to distinguish between knights of noble and of ministerial birth.Freed, NMK 578 Certain vassal relationships =Social differentiation= Legally, a ministerial was a ministerial, bound by the rights and duties enumerated in their area. Socially, there was a distinction between the greater ministerials and the lesser ones in the order of precedence.Freed, NB 51. Greater ministerials maintained their own subordinate milites, or armigerous soldiery. These could be either free knights (such as Werner of Bolland, who maintained 1,100 subordinate knights for Frederick Barbarossa) or lesser ministerials like the wealthy widow Diemut von Högl, who held four castles with ministerial chaplain, chamberlain and seneschal.Freed, NMK. 600. The lesser ministerials were ones who held no subordinates at all, but rather held an office and may or may not have maintained arms and armor.Freed, NB 52. =Uses and duties= As with all medieval terms of vassalage, the duties, obligations and benefits varied by region and even individual negotiation or tradition. These are often recorded in the Holy Roman Empire in a document named a Dienstrecht, or \\"service code.\\"Delbrűck 246 Military One constant is that all arrangements included a duty owed to the lord for military service. This could take the form of actual personal service by the ministeriales or a payment to fund others who went to war. The monastery of Maurmunster records the following: > When a campaign (profectio) of the king is announced to the bishop (of Metz, > in this case) the bishop will send an official to the abbot, and the abbot > will assemble his ministeriales. He will inform them of the campaign, and > they will assemble the following men and equipment...: one wagon with six > cows and six men; one packhorse with saddle and equipment and two men, the > leader and the driver...If the king moves the army to Italy, all the peasant > farms shall contribute for that purpose their usual taxes (that is, probably > an entire annual rent as an extraordinary tax). But if the army moves > against Saxony, Flanders or elsewhere on this side of the Alps, only half > that amount will be given. From these additional taxes the wagons and pack > animals will be loaded with rations and other items necessary for the > journey.Schöpflin, Alsatia diplomatica, 1:226. Waitz, Deutsche > Verfassungsgeschichte as quoted in Delbrück 101–2 In Bamberg the Carolingian method of providing for a campaign remained in effect. Ministeriales were grouped into threes; one went on campaign while the other two were responsible for equipping and victualing him.Delbrück 103 This ensured that those who were sent to war were prepared for war. this also shows that a military obligation didn't necessarily mean riding off with the army. The archbishops of Cologne differentiated between his poorer and wealthier vassals. Ministerials with an annual income of 5 marks or more were required to go on campaign in person, but those with smaller incomes were offered the choice to go on the march or to give half the income of their fief that year as a military tax.Delbrück, 103 Administration Ministerials fulfilled a range of offices that ran their lieges' fiefs for them. They were found in the four traditional offices of a household: chamberlain, marshal, butler and seneschal. Conrad II von Kuchl served his succession of archbishop lieges as a financial adviser for forty years,Freed, NB 62. Werner von Lengfelden was master of Hohensalzburg Castle's huge kitchen,Freed, NB 53. and Ulrich II served as vidame of Salzburg in 1261, then, at various times, as marshal between 1270 and 1295, and as burgrave of Tittmoning in 1282.Freed, NMK 600. Ministerials could also be assigned to claim unused or poorly defended border areas, as with Laudegg Castle and Hohenwerfen Castle. Trade and Commerce Greater ministerials considered themselves above trading in filthy money, as did many nobles of the era, but Freed notes a number of ministerials who couldn't afford to turn up their noses to income. Circa 1125, Timo served not only as the burgrave of Salzburg but also as a merchant of the city.Freed, NMK, 586. Ortolf of Kai - also a Salzburger - brokered the produce of his own vineyards.Freed, NB, 53 Gerhoh Itzling even appeared as a 'zechmeister' (guildmaster) in Salzburg.Freed, NB, 123. The type of guild is not specified. =Rights and restrictions= Nobility was a social distinction, so even the unfree ministerials were considered higher in precedence than a free commoner.Delbrűck, 230. Being of a noble estate, ministerials were exempt from the more odious of corvée duties that other types of serfs performed, though some lieges would reserve the right to commandeer plow-teams and draft horses. Some ministerial women did perform household duties but were well-compensated for the chores.Arnold, 66. Ministerials were serfs, and as such could not move without expressed permission of their lord or lady, though in certain clergy lands they could take holy orders without permission.Arnold, 54. Freed, NB 49 n 81. Ministerials were in many places forbidden to marry without permission, but other places upheld Galatians 3:28 that says no one may be denied a sacrament because of one's legal status.Freed, NB 67. Pope Hadrian IV (c. 1100-1159) reinforced this ruling. If a liege disliked any marriage, though, the liege could easily withdraw any lands or income held by his subject. Any marriage was subject to review or approval of the liege, as in Salzburg: > In July 1213 Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg (1200–1246) and Bishop > Manegold of Passau (1206–1215) asked King Frederick II at the imperial court > held at Eger (today Cheb in the Czech Republic) to confirm the marriage > contract that Gerhoch II of Bergheim-Radeck, an archiepiscopal ministerial, > had made with Bertha of Lonsdorf, a Passau ministerial. The couple had > agreed, presumably with their lords' consent, that their first two children > were to belong to Salzburg and the third to Passau, and that any remaining > children would be divided equally between the two churches. Gerhoch and > Bertha could confer their allod on each other, and their children would > share their paternal and maternal inheritances equally.Salzburger > Urkundenbuch 3:171, no. 666 as cited in Freed, NB 1 The usual rule was that children of a mixed-status marriage would have the legal standing of the lesser of the parents. The child of a free knight and an unfree ministerial, therefore, was a ministerial. The liege of the mother would be the child's liege, for the child \\"followed the womb\\" (partus sequitor ventrem).Freed, NB 65. Not everyone agrees with this interpretation, as some examples allow for free lords to challenge this ruling and maintain their status as free knights.

Seiberg–Witten curves In general, effective Lagrangians of supersymmetric gauge theories are largely determined by their holomorphic properties and their behavior near the singularities. In particular, in gauge theory with mathcal{N} = 2 extended supersymmetry, the moduli space of vacua is a special Kähler manifold and its Kähler potential is constrained by above conditions. In the original approach, by Seiberg and Witten, holomorphy and electric-magnetic duality constraints are strong enough to almost uniquely constrain the prepotential, and therefore the metric of the moduli space of vacua, for theories with SU(2) gauge group. More generally, consider the example with gauge group SU(n). The classical potential is This vanishes on the moduli space, so the vacuum expectation value of phi can be gauge rotated into Cartan subalgebra, making it a traceless diagonal complex matrix a. Because the fields phi no longer have vanishing vacuum expectation value, other fields become heavy due to the Higgs effect. They are integrated out in order to find the effective mathcal{N} = 2 Abelian gauge theory. Its two- derivative, four-fermions low-energy action can be expressed in terms of a single holomorphic function mathcal{F}, as follows: {dA} bar{A} + int d^2 theta frac{1}{2} frac{d^2 mathcal{F}}{dA^2} W_alpha W^alpha Bigr] ,}} {mathcal{A}^{4k}} mathcal{A}^2 ,}} The first term is a perturbative loop calculation and the second is the instanton part where k labels fixed instanton numbers. In theories whose gauge groups are products of unitary groups, mathcal{F} can be computed exactly, using localization, and the limit shape techniques. From mathcal{F} we can get the mass of the BPS particles. {da} ,}} One way to interpret this is that these variables a and its dual can be expressed as periods of a meromorphic differential on a Riemann surface called the Seiberg–Witten curve. Relation to integrable systems The special Kähler geometry on the moduli space of vacua in Seiberg–Witten theory can be identified with the geometry of the base of complex completely integrable system. The total phase of this complex completely integrable system can be identified with the moduli space of vacua of the 4d theory compactified on a circle. See Hitchin system. Seiberg–Witten prepotential via instanton counting Using supersymmetric localisation techniques, one can explicitly determine the instanton partition function of mathcal{N}=2 super Yang-Mills theory. The Seiberg-Witten prepotential can then be extracted using the localization approach of Nikita Nekrasov. It arises in the flat space limit varepsilon_{1}, varepsilon_{2} to 0, of the partition function of the theory subject to the so-called Omega-background. The latter is a specific background of four dimensional mathcal{N}=2 supergravity. It can be engineered, formally by lifting the super Yang–Mills theory to six dimensions, then compactifying on 2-torus, while twisting the four dimensional spacetime around the two non-contractible cycles. In addition, one twists fermions so as to produce covariantly constant spinors generating unbroken supersymmetries. The two parameters varepsilon_{1}, varepsilon_{2} of the Omega-background correspond to the angles of the spacetime rotation. In Ω-background, we can integrate out all the non-zero modes, so the path integral with the boundary condition phi to a at x to infty can be expressed as a sum over instanton number of the products and ratios of fermionic and bosonic determinants, producing the so-called Nekrasov partition function. In the limit where varepsilon_{1}, varepsilon_{2} approach 0, this sum is dominated by a unique saddle point. On the other hand, when varepsilon_{1}, varepsilon_{2} approach 0, left(mathcal{F}(a;Lambda)+mathcal{O}(varepsilon_{1},varepsilon_{2}) right) right),}} holds.

Hermon, north of the Golan Heights (also known as the capital of Golan Heights). The majority of residents are of Syrian-Druze origin. Since the June 1967 Six-Day War, the village has been governed by Israel, first under martial law, but since the adoption of the 1981 Golan Heights Law under Israeli civil law, and incorporated into the Israeli system of local councils. Majdal Shams is the largest of the four remaining Druze-Syrian communities on the Israeli-occupied side of Mount Hermon and the Golan Heights, together with Ein Qiniyye, Mas'ade and Buq'ata. Geologically and geographically a distinction is made between the Golan Heights and Mount Hermon, the boundary being marked by the Sa'ar Stream; however, administratively usually they are lumped together. Majdal Shams and Ein Qiniyye are on the Hermon side of the boundary, thus sitting on limestone, while Buq'ata and Mas'ade are on the Golan side, characterised by black volcanic rock (basalt). Etymology The name Majdal Shams is of Aramaic origin, meaning: \\"tower of sun,\\" possibly in reference to the town's elevation. Another hypothesis suggests that the town was originally called Majdal al-Sham (Majdal of Damascus) to distinguish it from the towns of al- Majdal on the Mediterranean coast and al-Majdal on the Sea of Galilee.Herbert Rix, Tent and Testament: A Camping Tour in Palestine with Some Notes on Scripture Sites (London: Williams and Norgate, 1907), 98 History =Ottoman era= According to one version, Majdal Shams was established in 1595 by Druze warlord Fakhr-al-Din II, in order to strengthen Druze presence in the Hermon mount. Another version says that the Druze families began to settle on the southern slopes of Mount Hermon in the early 18th century.Fadwa N. Kirrish, “Druze Ethnicity in the Golan Heights: the Interface of Religion and Politics,” Journal of the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs 13.1 (1992): 126 By the late 19th century, Majdal Shams was an important regional center and home of the local Ottoman administrator (Mudir).G. Schumacher, The Jaulan: Surveyed for the German Society for the Exploration of the Holy Land (London: Richard Bentley and Son, 1888): 10 In times of strife, residents of the surrounding villages travelled to Majdal Shams for safety because of the village's elevation and proximity to a major water source at Birkat Ram. During the winter of 1895, for example, Druze residents of neighboring communities sheltered in Majdal Shams during a local conflict between irregular Druze and Circassian militias.Drummond Hay, “Despatch No. 76 from Mr. Drummond Hay, Consul-General, Beyrout, to SirPhilip Currie, British Ambassador, Constantinople, 6 December 1895, regarding the fears of the Druzes of Mount Hermon of an attack by the Circassians and Kurds,” in Bejtullah Destani ed., Minorities in the Middle East, Druze Communities 1840-1974, Volume 3: 1866-1926 (London: Archive Editions, 2006): 192-194 In the late 19th century, Americans and Europeans began visiting Majdal Shams. In 1870, missionaries associated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America opened a school and church in the town. The mission school operated until 1885, when it was closed by Turkish authorities.Papers relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, Transmitted to Congress, With the Annual Message of the President, December 8, 1885 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1886): 836-839 Majdal Shams also attracted foreign geologists such as William Libbey because of the town's proximity to an exposed strata of Jurassic-era fossils.William Libbey and Franklin E.

In October 1925, a few months after Syrian Druze had begun fighting French forces in the nearby province of Jabal al-Duruz, a group of the town's Druze residents looted local Christian property. Mandate authorities sent troops to restore order, and community leaders contacted the central command of the revolt for assistance defending the town against the French.Lenka Bokova, Laconfrontation franco- syrienne à l’époque du mandat, 1925–1927 (Paris: Editions L'Harmattan, 1990), 220–221 In response, rebel leader Zaid al-Atrash (brother of Sultan al-Atrash) led a force of 1,000 men to Majdal Shams. Zaid al-Atrash drove French troops from the area and established a rebel garrison in Majdal Shams to guard the road between Damascus and Marjayoun.Bokova, La confrontation, 223 The garrison housed up to 10,000 rebels until April 1926, when French forces launched a renewed attack on the town. During the assault, French soldiers destroyed much of Majdal Shams and killed approximately 80 residents of the town.Tayseer Mara'i and Usama R.

During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, traditional leader Assad Kanj Abu Salah proposed forming a local militia to assist the rebels. The plan did not come to fruition; according to conflicting accounts, the militia never formed, or engaged in only a single symbolic attack on the Syria-Palestine border.Laila Parsons, The Druze Between Palestine and Israel, 1947–49 (New York: St.Martin's Press, 2000): 31; Yoav Gelber, \\"Druze and Jews in the War of 1948,\\" Middle Eastern Studies 31.2 (April 1995): 234 During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abu Salah's son Sultan formed a militia of 300 local men.

During the 1967 Six Day War, residents of the nearby towns of Ain Fit, Banias, Jubata ez-Zeit, and Za'ura took shelter in Majdal Shams. After Israeli forces had secured the area, soldiers forced refugees across the ceasefire line into Syrian controlled territory, but permitted residents of Majdal Shams and a few other communities to remain in their homes.Tayseer Mara’i and Usama R. Halabi, “Life Under Occupation in the Golan Heights,” Journal of Palestine Studies 22.1 (Autumn 1992): 79 As Israel and Syria fortified the ceasefire line, which ran along the eastern edge of Majdal Shams, the community was isolated from the rest of Syria. Many residents were separated from their relatives living or working in Syrian-controlled territory—as many as 50% from at least one sibling, parent, or child.Peter Ford, “Families Long for an End to Shouting,” Christian Science Monitor (27 October 1992): 7 Majdal Shams retained close ties to Syria. Residents frequently gathered at the eastern edge of the village with bullhorns to shout messages to friends and relatives on the Syrian side of the ceasefire line.Hannah Russell ed., Breaking Down the Fence: Addressing the Illegality of Family Separation in the Occupied Syrian Golan (Majdal Shams: Al-Marsad, The Arab Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Syrian Golan, 2010).

Although Israeli troops blockaded the town and attempted to force residents to accept citizen identification cards, the protesters succeeded in convincing the state to classify members of the community as non-citizens. Residents retained the right to apply for Israeli citizenship individually.The Bitter Year: Arabs Under Israeli Occupation in 1982 (Washington, D.C.:Arab-American Anti Discrimmination Committee, 1983): 16 During the 1970s, a few residents of Majdal Shams received permission to cross the ceasefire line into Syrian-controlled territory, either to rejoin relatives or attend university in Damascus.Hannah Russell ed., Breaking Down the Fence: Addressing the Illegality of Family Separation in the Occupied Syrian Golan (Majdal Shams: Al-Marsad, The Arab Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Syrian Golan, 2010):49; Bashar Tarabieh, “Education, Control, and Resistance in the Golan Heights,” Middle East Report 195/195 (May–August 1995): 44 During the 1990s, large numbers of residents began to receive permission to cross the ceasefire line to conduct religious pilgrimages or attend university. A small number of women also applied to cross the ceasefire line and marry Syrian men.Bashar Tarabieh, “The Syrian Community on the Golan Heights,” The Link 33.2 (April–May 2000): 8 This crossing program was the subject of the film The Syrian Bride.

Demography According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, Majdal Shams's population was in . The population growth rate is 2.5%. The ratio between men and women is 951 women for every 1,000 men. Most of the town's residents are Druze, but a few Christians remain of a much larger community that left the town in the 1940s and 1950s.Fadwa N. Kirrish, \\"Druze Ethnicity in the Golan Heights: The Interface of Religion and Politics,\\" Journal of the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs 13.1 (1992), 122-135 The inhabitants of Majdal Shams are considered Syrian citizens by the Syrian authorities. Since 1981 they have also been considered permanent residents of Israel. While they are entitled to full Israeli citizenship, as of 2011 only 10 percent of the Golan Druze have opted to become Israeli citizens.In the Golan Heights, Anxious Eyes Look East Those who apply for Israeli citizenship are entitled to vote, run for Knesset and receive an Israeli passport. For foreign travel, non-citizens are issued a laissez passer by the Israeli authorities. As Israel does not recognize their Syrian citizenship, they are defined in Israeli records as \\"residents of the Golan Heights.\\" Residents of Majdal Shams are not drafted by the Israel Defense Forces.Religious Freedoms: Druze For more about the status and position of the Golan Heights Druze community see here. As permanent residents, Majdal Shams inhabitants are free to work and study in Israel and are entitled to state services such as Kupat Holim health insurance.

It is located to the northeast of the city, in the municipality of Palilula.  Name  In Serbian the settlement is known as Ovča (Овча), in Romanian as Ofcea, in Hungarian as Ovcsa or Bárányos, and in German as Gisellenhain.  Location  Ovča is located in the northern, Banat section of the Palilula municipality (Pančevački Rit), 13 kilometers north of downtown Belgrade. The settlement is located 6 kilometers to the east of the settlement of Padinska Skela and the Zrenjaninski put road connects Belgrade with the city of Zrenjanin, in Vojvodina.  History  First recorded mention of the village of Ovči is from 1456, as part of the Syrmia county of the Kingdom of Hungary. The name has a Slavic origin. As some of the first settlers were Vlach (Romanian) shepherds, it is believed that this gave name to the settlement (Serbian word ovčar means \\"shepherd\\" in English). The village was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1537, and was included into the Sanjak of Smederevo. It was granted a waqf status by the sanjak-bey Mehmet-pasha, for the mosque and imaret (public kitchen) of Belgrade's Dorćol district. In the mid-18th century the village was evacuated because of the plague outbreak and Ovča sentry outpost was built instead. Turned into a wasteland, the village was repopulated in 1813. Ovča was part of the municipality of Borča until 30 May 1952 when it got its own municipality. However, in 1955 all the municipalities of the Pančevački Rit were merged into one, municipality of Krnjača, which in turn became part of the municipality of Palilula in 1965. A movement for restoring former municipality of Krnjača (under the name of Dunavski Venac) is gaining momentum since the early 2000s.  Population  Population, by the censuses, has been erratic, but is generally stagnating in the past several decades. The apparent decline of population by almost one quarter in the 1970s is a result of change of the administrative borders of the settlements, as many outer farms and smaller sub-settlements were regrouped into adjacent Padinska Skela, which in turn grew by these measures by over 400%. According to the last census of 2011, population of Ovča was 2,742. =Ethnic groups= The ethnic structure of Ovča: * Census 1931 (1,452): Romanians (96,42% or 1,400), Serbs (1,58% or 23), Germans (1,38% or 20), Slovaks (0,48% or 7), Hungarians (0,14% or 2) * Census 2002 (2,567): Serbs (63.96% or 1,642), Romanians (27.46%), Romani (1.36%), Yugoslavs (0.85%), Macedonians (0.62%), etc.  Economy  Despite being classified as an urban settlement, the majority of economic activity in Ovča is still agricultural. Prominent features are the large bowl natural gas tanks which dominate the flat landscape. Ovča is also accessible by train as it lies on the Belgrade–Pančevo railroad. A new stretch of highway between the Zrenjanin road and Ovča was built and opened on October 2015, as a part of the northern Belgrade bypass connecting Pančevo with the new Mihajlo Pupin Bridge over the Danube. The last section of the bypass, from Ovča to Pančevo road was opened in December 2015. The new road significantly improved transport connections to rather remote Ovča, and is expected to contribute to its development.  Sub-neighborhoods  = Ovča Spa = Health center in Ovča The hydrothermal spring Hydrothermal spring of Ovčanska banja (Ovča spa) is located in the settlement. A pond with an area of and deep has been filled by the natural salt water since the mid-1980s. The spa is not fully arranged for public usage but is very popular among the local population. Water is warm and salty and rich in minerals and sulfur. The healing mud is also used by the visitors. The surrounding canal, used for the melioration of the Pančevački Rit, overflew into the pond, but in 2011 an earthen embankment was constructed which prevented the mixing of waters. Also, the pond was enlarged, cleaned and its bottom was dredged. Surrounding area of was poured with the gravel. The pond is surrounded by the corn fields. The salt water has been tested and according to the city's regulatory plan for the area, it is a sodium chloride water, with elevated levels of bromine and iodine and low levels of radioactivity. Officially, the water is not suited for swimming but it may be used for the treatment of rheumatism, wounds and bone fractures healing, gynecological diseases, etc. In December 2017, Minister for construction Zorana Mihajlović announced that Ovča Spa was selected as the best location with the scopes of the government's project for building over 20,000 of low- cost apartments for the state employees. She asserted that the terrain will be prepared for the construction in the first half of 2018. It would be a first phase of the plan, consisting of 2,000 apartments, which would later continue in other parts of Belgrade. By 2018, city tried for several times to sell part of the spa area to developers, but all invitations to tender failed. City then drafted the regulatory plan which, with the development of the new settlement, includes the sports, recreational, touristic and spa facilities within the complex of Ovča Spa. = New settlement = In September 2016 works began on the new residential complex, which is located at the entrance into Ovča from the direction of Borča. It is planned to have 4,500-5,000 inhabitants, or almost twice more than the entire settlement of Ovča has at the moment. Project covers and area of 7.8 hectares and it will be divided into 4 blocks with 300 apartments each. In total, it will have 15 separate buildings and each one will look different. The project is work of eight different teams, in total 33 architects. It will also have a green market, elementary school, kindergarten, retirement home, playgrounds, sport fields, parks and commercial area. Out of 1,200 apartments, 1,000 are social housing and 200 are so-called “solidarity apartments”. First are to be populated with the people of low economic status (including refugees from the Yugoslav Wars) and the other are for the employees in state owned companies who, during the years, were paying into the residential funds. First phase, of 235 apartments, should be finished by October 2017 when the first settlers should move in. The apartments were finally housed in March 2018, but the construction of other phases of the settlement was halted as the city government gave priority to the social housing project in Kamendin. = Nova Ovča = In January 2020, city announced construction of the completely new settlement, south of Ovča and along the northern tangent of Belgrade bypass, named Nova Ovča (New Ovča). It was planned to spread over , with over 5,000 apartments and 15,000 inhabitants. The total planned floor area is , which includes building with no more than 4 floors, numerous parks, squares, 4 kindergartens, 2 elementary schools, 1 secondary school, sports center, cemetery (on , with church and chapel), etc. Apart from streets, Nova Ovča is planned to be connected with Ovča and Borča with bicycle paths, too.

It was directed by David Jones and stars Patrick Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge and Richard E. Grant as Bob Cratchit. The film was produced after Patrick Stewart performed a series of successful one man shows of A Christmas Carol on Broadway and in London. Plot On Christmas Eve in 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge, a surly money-lender at a counting house for seven years after his business partner Jacob Marley passed away, does not share the merriment of Christmas. He declines his nephew Fred's invitation to join him for Christmas dinner and dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity. His loyal and low paid employee Bob Cratchit offers Scrooge to have Christmas off since there will be no business for Scrooge during the day and Scrooge accepts, but demands that Cratchit arrive \\"all the earlier\\" the following day. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley, who warns him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like he was, informing him that three spirits will visit him during the next three nights. Even though Scrooge was reluctantly declined their visits. Jacob Marley warned Scrooge, without their visit that he can't escape the path he took, expect the first one around midnight. At midnight, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life. They visit his lonely school days in boarding school where his friends were all going home for Christmas and he isn't allowed to come home because his father treated him badly after his mother died of giving birth to him. Scrooge sister franny comes to Scrooge's school and their father is a lot nicer than he is now and he agreed that he could come home for Christmas. Franny died a young woman and had a nephew who also died of giving birth to him. Next Christmas, this time as an employee under Albert Fezziwig who had a good heart and treated Scrooge like a second father. Fezziwig throws a Christmas party, Scrooge attends and meets a young woman named Belle, whom he falls in love with and was engaged. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him when he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge extinguishes the Ghost as he returns to the present. At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the merry Ghost of Christmas Present, which shows Scrooge the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner, Scrooge taking pity on Cratchit's ill son Tiny Tim. The Ghost eventually ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. As the Ghost dies, he warns Scrooge about the evils of \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"Want\\", who manifest themselves before Scrooge as two demonic children. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives, appearing as a tall, silent cloaked figure, and takes Scrooge into the future. At the stock exchange, Scrooge's acquaintances discuss the death of an unnamed colleague, but would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided and no one would go since he wasn't nicest guy in the world. In a den, Scrooge recognizes his charwoman Mrs. Dilber, his laundress Mrs. Riggs, and the local undertaker trading several of the man's stolen possessions to a fence named Old Joe. Later, he sees a young couple who owed the man money are relieved he is dead, as they have more time to pay off their debt. The Ghost transports Scrooge to Cratchit's house, discovering Tiny Tim has died with his father still talking to him . The Ghost escorts Scrooge to a cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, revealing Scrooge was the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge vows to change his ways just as the Ghost disappears. The grave opens, and Scrooge sees his dead self lying in a coffin. He falls into the grave, then clings to his own dead body as he falls through the earth into Hell. Awakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge finds the ghosts had visited him all in one night instead of three. Gleeful at having survived the spirits, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out with the charity workers and the citizens of London to spread happiness in the city. The following day, he gives Cratchit a raise and becomes like \\"a second father\\" to Tiny Tim, who escapes death. Scrooge and the Cratchits celebrate Christmas. and Tiny Tim has recovered from his illness Inspiration Rather than deliberately trying to resemble either the 1938 MGM version or the George C. Scott made-for-TV version in the cheerfulness and \\"Christmassy\\" feeling of their settings, the 1999 film takes as its inspiration to the classic 1951 film version with Alastair Sim in the grimness of some of its scenes and set design, although it still includes many cheerful moments.

September 22, 1955. was an American Academy Award-winning screenwriter and playwright, best known for his collaborations with director-producer Frank Capra.  Early life  Robert Riskin was born on New York City's Lower East side to Jewish parents, Bessie and Jakob, who had emigrated from Czarist Russia to escape conscription. He and his two brothers and two sisters grew up speaking Yiddish. An enthusiast of the vaudeville stage, the teen-age Riskin took every opportunity to sneak into the theatre and catch the shows. He was a particular fan of the comedians who performed there, and he habitually transcribed their jokes into a notebook he carried with him. While still a teen-ager, Riskin took a job with a shirt-manufacturing firm, Heidenheim and Levy. The partners of this firm had a sideline business, investing in the new film industry. They sent the seventeen-year-old Riskin to Florida to run a production company for them. Riskin turned out one- and two-reel films until his enlistment in the Army during World War I.Gladstone, Bill, “Remembering Robert Riskin” November 15, 2011 Retrieved December 19, 2013 Career It Happened One Night (1934) At the end of the war, Riskin returned to New York City, where, in partnership with a friend, he found some success in producing plays for Broadway. Riskin began his career as a playwright, writing for many local New York City playhouses. Two of his plays, Bless You, Sister and Many a Slip, had successful runs. Riskin continued his Broadway career until the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression caused many theatres to close. Motion pictures had just adopted sound, and writers were needed who could write dialogue and were experienced with stage work. Riskin recognized he had the credentials and seized the opportunity by relocating to Hollywood. He moved to Hollywood in 1931 after Columbia Pictures bought the screen rights to several of his plays. His first collaboration with director Frank Capra was the Barbara Stanwyck vehicle The Miracle Woman (1931). Riskin wrote several films for Columbia, but it was his string of hits with Capra that brought him acclaim. Riskin received Academy Award nominations for his screenplays and stories for five Capra films: Lady for a Day (1933), which Riskin had adapted from a Damon Runyon short story; It Happened One Night (1934), for which he won the Oscar; Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) with Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur; You Can't Take It with You (1938) with Lionel Barrymore and James Stewart; and Here Comes the Groom (1951) with Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman. Riskin joined Capra in an independent production company in 1939, but they fell out in 1941. Riskin then became an associate producer for Samuel Goldwyn.\\"Robert Riskin Joins Metro as Producer-Writer -- Paramount and Roxy Top Holiday Marks.\\" New York Times. January 2, 1942. When the U.S. entered World War II, he joined the Office of War Information in 1942, where he organized the OWI's overseas division. Riskin returned to Hollywood in 1945, with the screenplay for The Thin Man Goes Home He had an uncredited collaboration on the 1946 film noir classic The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. Riskin and his brother Everett formed their own film company. Their first film, the minor James Stewart hit Magic Town (1946), was written and produced by Riskin, who also directed initially. The directing was finished by William A. Wellman. Magic Town has a similar flavor and tone to Riskin's Capra-directed films. In 1950, Riskin suffered a debilitating stroke which left him unable to write. Riskin had completed the screenplay for Half Angel (1951) and the story for Here Comes the Groom (1951) before the stroke. Ironically, Capra was assigned to direct Here Comes the Groom, and Riskin received a fifth Academy Award nomination for it. He was an invalid until he died on September 20, 1955. Riskin directed only one entire film, When You're in Love (1937), a minor musical starring Grace Moore and Cary Grant. Unsuccessful at the box office, When You're in Love is now remembered (if at all) for an unusual publicity stunt: silent film-star Louise Brooks was given a chance at a comeback by appearing as a chorus girl in this movie. = Relationship with Frank Capra = From 1931 to 1938, Riskin and Capra collaborated on eight films as screenwriter and director. Riskin contributed to at least six other screenplays directed by Capra. These films were nominated for 29 Academy Awards, including eight nominations for Riskin and Capra, and won ten, including three for Capra and one for Riskin. During this period, Riskin and Capra had what appeared to be a harmonious working relationship. Their personal relationship, however, was strained. Riskin was politically liberal, while Capra was a committed, conservative Republican. The protagonists of the Capra-Riskin films were described as “Capra’s Heroes”, when in fact they were more a product of Riskin’s ideology and social conscience.Scott, Ian. In Capra’s Shadow: The Life and Career of Screenwriter Robert Riskin University of Kentucky Press, 2006, p. 148 In 1939, looking for creative autonomy unavailable in the studio system, Riskin and Capra formed an independent production company, Frank Capra Productions. The partnership was divided 65% for Capra, 35% for Riskin. In 1941, Capra directed Riskin's Meet John Doe.Churchill, Douglas W. \\"Capra and Riskin to Film 'Life and Death of John Doe' for First Independent Venture.\\" New York Times. November 7, 1939. However, Riskin felt that Capra was taking all the credit for their films, including Riskin's share. Riskin came to resent Capra for this. This led to several confrontations with Capra during the production of Meet John Doe. According to an account by Hollywood screenwriter David Rintels (which was denied by Capra), Riskin brandished 120 blank pages in Capra's face and challenged: \\"Put the famous Capra touch on that!\\" After completion of just one film, Meet John Doe, the association was dissolved.Scott, Ian, In Capra’s Shadow: The Life and Career of Screenwriter Robert Riskin University of Kentucky Press, 2006, p.138 Riskin never willingly collaborated with Capra again. During the time of his declining health, home confinement, and final residence at the Motion Picture & Television Country Home and Hospital, Riskin was regularly visited by old friends such as Edward G. Robinson, Jack Benny, and Irving Berlin. Long time friend and screenwriting colleague Jo Swerling and his wife remained devoted visitors. Conspicuously absent was Frank Capra, who never visited Riskin during the five years of his illness. Swerling was pained by Capra’s behavior, but Riskin refused to disparage Capra. He remained loyal to the man, calling him “his best friend”. The Los Angeles Examiner covered Riskin’s funeral in September 1955, describing the “notables” in attendance. The report also identified the “one man who wasn’t there”: Frank Capra.Scott, Ian, In Capra’s Shadow: The Life and Career of Screenwriter Robert Riskin University of Kentucky Press, 2006, Prologue: \\"The Three Act Play\\" In 1961, Capra directed A Pocketful of Miracles, a remake of Capra and Riskin's 1933 collaboration Lady for a Day, with a screenplay by Hal Kanter and Harry Tugend from the Riskin-Runyon material. It was Capra's last film. Personal life and family Riskin married actress Fay Wray in 1942.\\"Fay Wray Married to Robert Riskin.\\" New York Times August 25, 1942. They had three children: Susan (born 1936), Robert (born 1943), and Victoria (born 1945). (Susan was the child of Wray's first marriage and was adopted by Riskin in 1942.) They remained married until his death. George Jessel read the eulogy at Riskin's funeral. Interment was at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California. Riskin’s older brother, Everett (born 1895), was a Hollywood film producer (1934–52). He produced many noteworthy films, including The Thin Man Goes Home, written by Robert.

In contrast with complete markets, this shortage of securities will likely restrict individuals from transferring the desired level of wealth among states. An Arrow security purchased or sold at date t is a contract promising to deliver one unit of income in one of the possible contingencies which can occur at date t + 1. If at each date-event there exists a complete set of such contracts, one for each contingency that can occur at the following date, individuals will trade these contracts in order to insure against future risks, targeting a desirable and budget feasible level of consumption in each state (i.e. consumption smoothing). In most set ups when these contracts are not available, optimal risk sharing between agents will not be possible. For this scenario, agents (homeowners, workers, firms, investors, etc.) will lack the instruments to insure against future risks such as employment status, health, labor income, prices, among others.  Markets, securities and market incompleteness  In a competitive market, each agent makes intertemporal choices in a stochastic environment. Their attitudes toward risk, the production possibility set, and the set of available trades determine the equilibrium quantities and prices of assets that are traded. In an \\"idealized\\" representation agents are assumed to have costless contractual enforcement and perfect knowledge of future states and their likelihood. With a complete set of state contingent claims (also known as Arrow–Debreu securities) agents can trade these securities to hedge against undesirable or bad outcomes. When a market is incomplete, it typically fails to make the optimal allocation of assets. That is, the First Welfare Theorem no longer holds. The competitive equilibrium in an Incomplete Market is generally constrained suboptimal. The notion of constrained suboptimality was formalized by Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986).  Possible reasons for market incompleteness  Despite the latest ongoing innovation in financial and insurance markets, markets remain incomplete. While several contingent claims are traded routinely against many states such as insurance policies, futures, financial options, among others, the set of outcomes is far greater than the set of claims. In practice the idea of a state contingent security for every possible realization of nature seems unrealistic. For example, if the economy lacks the institutions to guarantee that the contracts are enforced, it is unlikely that agents will either sell or buy these securities. Another common way to motivate the absence of state contingent securities is asymmetric information between agents. For example, the realization of labor income for a given individual is private information and it cannot be known without cost by anyone else. If an insurance company cannot verify the individual's labor income, the former would always have the incentive to claim a low realization of income and the market would collapse.  Failure of the standard complete markets model  Many authors have argued that modeling incomplete markets and other sorts of financial frictions is crucial to explain the counterfactual predictions of the standard Complete Market models. The most notable example is the equity premium puzzle Mehra and Prescott (1985), where the Complete Market model failed to explain the historical high equity premium and low risk-free rate. Along with the Equity premium puzzle other counterfactual implications of the Complete Market model are related to the empirical observations concerning individuals’ consumption, wealth and market transactions. For example, in a Complete Market framework, given that agents can fully insure against idiosyncratic risks, each individual's consumption must fluctuate as much as anyone else's, and the relative position in terms wealth distribution of an individual should not vary much over time. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. Further, the individual consumptions are not highly correlated with each other and wealth holdings are very volatile.  Modeling market incompleteness  In the economic and financial literature, a significant effort has been made in recent years to part from the setting of Complete Markets. Market incompleteness is modeled as an exogenous institutional structure or as an endogenous process. In the first approach, the economic models take as given the institutions and arrangements observed in actual economies. This approach has two advantages. First the structure of the model is similar to that of the Arrow–Debreu model to make it amenable to the powerful techniques of analysis developed for that framework. Second it is easy to compare model allocations with their empirical counterpart. Among the first papers using this approach, Diamond (1967) focused directly on the “realistic” market structure consisting of the stock and bond markets. The other set of models explicitly account for the frictions that could prevent full insurance, but derive the optimal risk-sharing endogenously. This literature has focused on information frictions. Risk sharing in private information models with asset accumulation and enforcement frictions. The advantage of this approach is that market incompleteness and the available state contingent claims respond to the economic environment, which makes the model appealing for policy experiments since it is less vulnerable to the Lucas critique.  Example of complete vs. incomplete markets  Suppose there is an economy with two agents (Robinson and Jane) with identical log utility functions. There are two equally likely states of nature. If state 1 is realized, Robinson is endowed with 1 unit of wealth and Jane with 0. In state 2, Robinson gets 0 while Jane receives 1 unit of wealth. With Complete Markets there are two state contingent claims: * q_1 pays 1 unit in state 1 and 0 otherwise. * q_2 pays 1 unit in state 2 and 0 in state 1. Before the realization of the uncertainty, the two agents can trade the state contingent securities. In equilibrium, the two Arrow-Debreu securities have the same price and the allocation is as follows: * Robinson buys 0.5 of q_2 and sells 0.5 of q_1 . * Jane buys 0.5 of q_1 and sells 0.5 of q_2 . The main outcome in this economy is that both Robinson and Jane will end up with 0.5 units of wealth independently of the state of nature that is realized. If the market is incomplete, meaning one or both of the securities are not available for trade, the two agents can't trade to hedge against a bad realization of nature and thus remain exposed to the possibility of the undesirable outcome of having zero wealth. In fact, with certainty, one of the agents will be 'rich' and the other 'poor'. This example is an extreme case of market incompleteness. In practice, agents do have some type of savings or insurance instrument. The main point here is to illustrate the potential welfare losses that can arise if markets are incomplete.

He was a Meritorious Artist of Russia (1970). Biography Pavel Klushantsev was born in Saint Petersburg into a Russian family.Pavel Klushantsev, ed. by Zhanna Klushantseva. Away from Big Roads. Moscow, 1994 (Autobiography, in Russian) His mother was a housewife of noble heritage. After the October revolution she worked as a teacher in a boarding school. During the 1930s her elder brother, a former White officer, was arrested under the suspicion of Sergey Kirov's murder and sent to prison camps.Interview with Zhanna Klushantseva by Olga Gorshakova // Moskovskij Komsomolets, 2015-09-24 She died of starvation during the Leningrad Blockade. Pavel's father came from a small town of Staritsa in the Tver Oblast. He spent many years working as a zemstvo doctor following his graduation from the medical academy in Saint Petersburg. He was later appointed to work in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Empire and was granted a personal nobility. After the revolution he spent some years selling tickets on a railway station. He died in 1919. Klushantsev graduated from the Leningrad Fototechnikum in 1930 and worked for Belgoskino as a cinematographer for four years. In 1934, he began working at Lenfilm / Lennauchfilm, where he became a director and producer, primarily making science educational films including his visionary film – Road to the Stars (1957). Prior to this film, Klushantsev's films were strictly factual, but here, the film builds on fact and extends it. The film becomes a hybrid documentary blending science with fiction edging firmly into science fiction. This film's special effects – the scientific accuracy of depicting weightlessness, construction in earth orbit, a rotating space station, and rocket travel to the moon – were the cutting edge visual effects of their time. Planet of the Storms (Planeta Bur), Klushantsev's only feature film, was released in 1962. For this film, Klushantsev is especially noted for his meticulous design and creation of \\"John the Robot\\". Based on Chester E. Macduffee's 1911 heavy Cast-Aluminium Diving Suit, it had over 42 points of articulation on its major body joints – one of the most technically complex robot costumes of its time. The film was subsequently re-edited and expanded by Roger Corman for American distribution – as Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965) by Curtis Harrington and as Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1968) by Peter Bogdanovich. In both these versions, the original scenes drew acclaim. Subsequent to Planet of the Storms, Klushantsev fell into disfavor in USSR and returned to making more science-based films. In 1972, his services were terminated. He is a well-known author of popular scientific juvenile books. Pavel Klushantsev spent his later years in his flat in Saint Petersburg. In an interview, he criticized the post-Soviet Russia for the absence of culture and television — for the lack of interest in educational films, in raising polymaths.\\"Popular science is dying, because there is no money, no demand, nobody wants to educate — everyone just wants to make money every way possible. But one mustn't live like this! This is how animals live. Men have reached the level of animals, all they want is to eat and sleep. There's no understanding that we are humanity that passes a certain phase of evolution. We must understand the direction of this evolution. For this we need culture, knowledge. If suddenly a magician appeared and resurrected the culture — at least the one we had during the Khrushchev's times — I assure you, in a week the economy would started working, and in a month all politics would stabilise and everything would return to its place\\". Pavel Klushantsev on the film Meteors from the interview with Pavel Klushantsev by Igor Voitenko, Russia-K, 1997 Klushantsev died in 1999 at the age of 89. He was buried at the Smolensky Cemetery.Klushantsev Pavel Vladimirovich (1910 – 1999) at the Saint Petersburg's Necropolis site He was survived by his wife, animator Nadezda Alexadnrovna Klushantseva (1912-2000), and his two children: Zhanna Klushantseva (born 1936) and Michael Klushansev (born 1945). Pavel Klushantsev's works are featured among Russian Fantastika.

Publication history A former member of the Teen Titans, Red Star first appeared under the name Starfire in Teen Titans #18 (Dec. 1968) and was created by Len Wein, Marv Wolfman and Bill Draut. Fictional character biography While still a young teenager, Leonid Kovar and his father Konstantin (an archaeologist) investigate a spaceship that has crashed into the Yenisei River; during their investigation the ship explodes. It imbues Leonid with energy and gives him super-strength, speed, and pyrokinesis. Being a Russian patriot who believes in communism, he offers his services to his country and becomes the first official Russian superhero in the DC Universe, taking the name Starfire. He does not reappear until New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #18 in 1982. A new character named Starfire is on the team at this point, and Leonid subsequently changes his codename to \\"Red Star\\". He is one of the heroes that assemble to fight the Villain War in Crisis on Infinite Earths, although his politics cause friction with both Hawk and Negative Woman, a Soviet defector. In New Titans #76 (1991), Red Star joins the Teen Titans. After two years, Red Star leaves the Titans with Pantha and Baby Wildebeest to form a family.New Titans (vol. 2) #114 (September 1994) They eventually move to the Soviet locale called 'Science City'. He is not seen again until the JLA/Titans miniseries in 1999. He makes a few minor appearances over the next few years and is featured in Infinite Crisis #4, in which he is frozen solid by Superboy-Prime after witnessing the brutal murder of Pantha and Baby Wildebeest. In the Infinite Crisis hardback collection, he is seen several hours later at a mass for fallen heroes. He joins the Titans during the one year jump, but leaves the team for unknown reasons. He helps them in their search for Raven. Since his last appearance he has stopped an invasion of Russia by the aliens from his origin, and been appointed State Protector. He is now based in a ship similar to the one that exploded, hovering over Moscow. Red Star later greets Tim Drake, a former teammate of his during the one year jump, when he comes to Russia for a meeting with Viktor Mikalek, a powerful business tycoon with suspected ties to the criminal organization known as the Society. When the meeting is interrupted by a vengeful female vigilante named Promise, Red Star intervenes and rescues Mikalek. After finding Tim in the midst of a discussion with Promise, Red Star mistakenly believes that they are working together, only for Tim to reveal Mikalek’s dealings with the Society. Red Star claims that he is well aware of Mikalek’s criminal activities, and states that they are a necessary evil needed to rescue Russia’s failing economy from total collapse. He attacks Tim, who breaks into Red Star's alien ship and discovers a stockpile of nuclear warheads.Red Robin #18 Following an adventure in the Undernet, Red Robin is allowed to leave.Red Robin #19 During the final battle between the Teen Titans and Superboy-Prime's Legion of Doom, Red Star and a group of other former Titans arrive to help turn the tide.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #99 He attacks Prime himself, angrily blaming him for the death of his family. Although he does manage to hurt Prime, Red Star is quickly overpowered by the villain, but is rescued by the other Titans.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #100 In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Red Star is seen on TV coming out of retirement to serve the people of Russia as a member of the People's Heroes.Doomsday Clock #5 (May 2018). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Red Star is empowered by unknown alien energies that have caused chain reactions within his molecular structure, altering his physical abilities and reflexes. Over time, these abilities have changed and he has developed from merely having augmented strength and speed to being equipped with an array of different powers. Red Star's abilities include superhuman strength, speed, invulnerability, and endurance. Red Star can also morph into a form that is composed of fire-like energy that allows him to form and redirect energies as well. It seems his powers have the same effect on Kryptonians as his namesake, as he uses them against Superboy-Prime during the Sinestro Corps War. Other versions =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Red Star is a member of the H.I.V.E. council. He voted for innocent civilians to live in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman before using nuclear weapons to end the war.Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint #1 (June 2011) In other media =Teen Titans= Teen Titans episode \\"Snowblind\\". Red Star features prominently in the Teen Titans episode \\"Snowblind\\", voiced by Jason Marsden. He assists Starfire during a mission in Russia and quickly becomes a friend and ally to her and the Titans. The origin of Red Star's powers is explained via flashback as one nearly identical to that of Marvel Comics's Captain America, wherein a lowly yet patriotic citizen is recruited to a secret government project led by Professor Chang to be transformed into a supersoldier. He is one of the few superheroes in the series to be acknowledged by his real name, being addressed as \\"Captain Kovar\\" by Raskov, a former General suggested to be in charge of the program. Red Star is granted superior strength, stamina, and the ability to generate radiation thanks to the government experiment. He lacks control over his radiation, which builds up in proportion to his emotional state. For this reason, Red Star has been living in voluntary exile in an abandoned Siberian nuclear power plant, where he uses the facilities to funnel his excess radiation into liquid capsules whenever the energy builds up too much. A leakage in the containment unit made the radiation melt up the snow outside which seeped into a pond, where it eventually created a plasma monster which wreaks havoc on the surrounding settlements, acting out Red Star's latent resentments. Red Star gets blamed for the creature's actions, partly because of the destruction he had inadvertently caused when his powers went berserk the first time. Red Star spends a lot of time with Starfire during the episode, perhaps in reference to his character's original codename. Encouraged by Starfire to embrace his powers instead of fighting them back, Red Star fights the creature and destroys it by pumping it full of an overdose of radioactive energy. However, this causes energy within his body to rise to uncontrollable levels, leading him to ask Starfire to take him into space, where his power is released in a gigantic explosion. Before his departure, the Titans make Red Star an honorary member, and his people (who previously shunned and feared him) now see him as a hero. Red Star reappears alive in \\"Titans Together\\" along with Starfire and Bumblebee in the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Evil to help the Titans fight the assembled supervillains. How he survived the outburst of his energy is never explained, though his newly acquired flight ability would allow him to return easily after the explosion. He also acquired the ability to create fire from his hands, like his comic book counterpart. =Arrow= Red Star's father, Konstantin Kovar, is mentioned in season four episode \\"Lost in the Flood\\" as a Russian criminal and dictator by Taiana Venediktov who rules her village Krasnoyarsk. After Oliver mortally wounds her due to Khushu idol corruption, she requests him to take him down before dying, which Oliver promises as depicted in \\"Schism\\". He appears in the season 5 flashbacks as the main antagonist, portrayed by Dolph Lundgren. Oliver goes to Russia to join the ranks of the Bratva in order to infiltrate his criminal organisation, with help from his friend and ally Anatoly Knyazev. He meets him in \\"So It Begins\\" when Oliver was sent to destroy his casino before the capture. He has a connection with corrupt Bratva captain Ishmael Gregor who takes Oliver back to Bratva in \\"Vigilante\\". Konstantin plans to overthrow the Russian government and return Russia to its former glory and destroy the Bratva in the process. In \\"Kapiushon\\", he meets with businessman and Oliver’s future nemesis Malcolm Merlyn to buy sarin gas and kill all members of the Russian government and military in his casino. He also kills Taiana's mother and servant Galina for betrayal. He unleashes the gas, but is prevented by Oliver, Anatoly and his Bratva men. Oliver gives him a deadly blow, but he survives aided by his men and Malcolm in recovering from injury. Kovar later finds out that Oliver goes to Lian Yu for an arranged fake rescue made by Anatoly and captures him. He injects the interrogation drug chemical \\"Red Star\\" in him to make him relieve his worst moments in his life and leaves him in his Lian Yu prison cell with a gun, confident that he will commit suicide. In season five finale, \\"Lian Yu\\", Oliver escapes the prison, kills Kovar and his men before setting his own rescue as depicted in \\"Pilot\\". =Titans= Mark Antony Krupa played Leonid’s father Konstantin Kovar in the pilot episode of Titans. He is killed by Starfire after trying to shoot her during an argument. Afterwards, she takes a picture of Rachel Roth (Raven) from his desk and sets out to find her.

Red Lake Airport is located south of the community of Cochenour, Ontario. The airport serves as a point of call for air carriers offering scheduled passenger service; an operating base for Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; and services both private and commercial fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter operators located on site. History Commercial air service to the area began in 1926 using the waters of Howey Bay on Red Lake as a float and sea plane base. Due to the freight requirements of the gold mines developing in the area, Howey Bay was recognized as the busiest airport in the world during 1936 and 1937. Construction of a gravel runway began in 1946 and was put into use of May 29, 1947 when Canadian Pacific Air Lines began daily service from Winnipeg. The airport operated privately until 1959 when the Department of Transport took over and lighting was installed. In 1996, the Township of Golden became the owner/operator of the Red Lake Airport and two years later, in 1998, the Township of Golden and Red Lake along with the Local Services Board of Madsen amalgamated to form the Municipality of Red Lake. It wasn't until 1993 when the paved runway was extended to to help serve the future growth of the Red Lake area. In October 2011, a new airport terminal opened, replacing a small terminal building from the 1980s. On June 22, 2012, the airport terminal was officially named J.E.J. Fahlgren Terminal after a local mine manager and community leader. Those leaving or arriving in Red Lake now enter a building that has a large ticket and rental car counters, luggage carousels, naturally lit seating areas, Nav Canada offices and space for administration. Along with these additions, a modern parking lot has been implemented and a rental space is available for franchises inside the airport terminal building.

US companies storing customer data could self-certify that they adhered to 7 principles, to comply with the EU Data Protection Directive and with Swiss requirements.

However, after a customer complained that his Facebook data were insufficiently protected, the ECJ declared in October 2015 that the Safe Harbour decision was invalid, leading to further talks being held by the Commission with the US authorities towards \\"a renewed and sound framework for transatlantic data flows\\".Vera Jourova, \\"Commissioner Jourová's remarks on Safe Harbour EU Court of Justice judgement before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE)\\", 26 October 2015 The European Commission and the United States agreed to establish a new framework for transatlantic data flows on 2 February 2016, known as the \\"EU–US Privacy Shield\\"The new transatlantic data “Privacy Shield”, accessed 25 February 2016, which was closely followed by the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Background history In 1980, the OECD issued recommendations for protection of personal data in the form of eight principles. These were non-binding and in 1995, the European Union (EU) enacted a more binding form of governance, i.e. legislation, to protect personal data privacy in the form of the Data Protection Directive.Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data According to the Data Protection Directive, companies operating in the European Union are not permitted to send personal data to \\"third countries\\" outside the European Economic Area, unless they guarantee adequate levels of protection, \\"the data subject himself agrees to the transfer\\" or \\"if Binding corporate rules or Standard Contractual Clauses have been authorised.\\"European Commission (15 June 2001)Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries under Directive 95/46/EC15 June 2001, Official Journal L 181 of 04.07.2001. The latter means that privacy protection can be at an organizational level, where a multinational organization produces and documents its internal controls on personal data or they can be at the level of a country if its laws are considered to offer protection equal to the EU. The Safe Harbour Privacy Principles were developed between 1998 and 2000. They were designed to prevent private organizations within the European Union or United States which store customer data from accidentally disclosing or losing personal information. US companies could opt into a program and be certified if they adhered to seven principles and 15 frequently asked questions and answers per the Directive. In July 2000, the European Commission (EC) decided that US companies complying with the principles and registering their certification that they met the EU requirements, the so-called \\"safe harbour scheme\\", were allowed to transfer data from the EU to the US. This is referred to as the Safe Harbour decision.European Court of Justice 2000/520/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce (notified under document number C(2000) 2441) (Text with EEA relevance.) 25 August 2000, retrieved 30 October 2015 On 6 October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EC's Safe Harbour Decision, because \\"legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life\\" (boldened in original text). According to the European Commission, the EU–US Privacy Shield agreed on 2 February 2016 \\"reflects the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its ruling on 6 October 2015, which declared the old Safe Harbour framework invalid. The new arrangement will provide stronger obligations on companies in the U.S. to protect the personal data of Europeans and stronger monitoring and enforcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission, including through increased cooperation with European Data Protection Authorities. The new arrangement includes commitments by the U.S. that possibilities under U.S. law for public authorities to access personal data transferred under the new arrangement will be subject to clear conditions, limitations and oversight, preventing generalised access.

The organization must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints. * Choice – Individuals must have the option to opt out of the collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties. * Onward Transfer – Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other organizations that follow adequate data protection principles. * Security – Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information. * Data Integrity – Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose it was collected. * Access – Individuals must be able to access information held about them, and correct or delete it, if it is inaccurate. * Enforcement – There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.

If an organization fails to comply with the framework it must promptly notify the Department of Commerce, or else it can be prosecuted under the 'False Statements Act'. In a 2011 case, the Federal Trade Commission obtained a consent decree from a California-based online retailer that had sold exclusively to customers in the United Kingdom. Among its many alleged deceptive practices was representing itself as having self-certified under Safe Harbour when in fact it had not. It was barred from using such deceptive practices in the future.  Criticism and evaluation  =EU evaluations= The EU–US Safe Harbour Principles 'self certification scheme' has been criticised in regard to their compliance and enforcement in three external EU evaluations: * A 2002 review by the European Union found \\"a substantial number of organisations that have self-certified adherence to the Safe Harbour do not seem to be observing the expected degree of transparency as regards their overall commitment or as regards the contents of their privacy policies\\" and that \\"not all dispute resolution mechanisms have indicated publicly their intention to enforce Safe Harbour rules and not all have in place privacy practices applicable to themselves.\\"European Commission (2002) The application of Commission Decision on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles 11 pages, retrieved 30 October 2015 * 2004 review by the European Union:European Commission (2004) The implementation of Commission Decision on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles 11 pages, retrieved 30 October 2015 * In 2008, an Australian consulting company named Galexia issued a scathing review, finding \\"the ability of the US to protect privacy through self-regulation, backed by claimed regulator oversight was questionable'. They documented basic claims as incorrect where only 1109 out of 1597 recorded organisations listed by the US Department of Commerce (DOC) on 17 October 2008 remained in the database after doubles, triples and ‘not current’ organisations were removed. Only 348 organisations met even the most basic requirements for compliance. Of these, only 54 extended their Safe Harbor membership to all data categories (manual, offline, online, human resources). 206 organisations falsely claimed to be members for years, yet there was no indication that they were subject of any US enforcement. Reviewers criticized the DOC's 'Safe Harbor Certification Mark' offered to companies to use as a \\"visual manifestation of the organization when it self-certifies that it will comply\\" as misleading, because it does not carry the words \\"self certify\\" on it. Only 900 organizations provided a link to their privacy policies, for 421 it was unavailable. Numerous policies were only 1-3 sentences long, containing \\"virtually no information\\". Many entries appeared to confuse privacy compliance with security compliance and showed a \\"lack of understanding about the Safe Harbor program\\". The companies' listing of their dispute resolution providers was confusing, and problems regarding independence and affordability were noted. Many organisations did not spell out that they would cooperate with or explain to their customers that they could choose the dispute resolution panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities. :Galexia recommended the EU to re-negotiate the Safe Harbor arrangement, provide warnings to EU consumers and consider to comprehensively review all list entries. They recommended to the US to investigate the hundreds of organisations making false claims, revising its statements about the number of participants, to abandon the use of the Safe Harbor Certification Mark, to investigate the unauthorised and misleading use of its Departmental logo and automatically suspend an organisation’s membership if they failed to renew their Safe Harbor certification.Chris Connolly (Galexia) US Safe Harbor - Fact or Fiction? Privacy Laws and Business International, issue 96, December 2008, published on Galexia.com, retrieved 30 October 2015 =Patriot Act's reach= In June 2011, Microsoft U.K.'s managing director Gordon Frazer said that \\"cloud data, regardless of where it is in the world, is not protected against the Patriot Act.\\"Zack Whittaker, Microsoft admits Patriot Act can access EU- based cloud data Zdnet.com, June 28, 2011, retrieved 30 October 2015 The Netherlands promptly ruled out U.S. cloud suppliers from Dutch government contracts, and even considered a ban on Microsoft- and Google-provided cloud contracts. A Dutch subsidiary of the U.S. based Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) runs the electronic health records of the Dutch national health service system and warned, that unless CSC could assure it was not subject to the Patriot Act, it would end the contract. One year later in 2012, a legal research paper supported the notion that the Patriot Act allowed U.S. law enforcement to bypass European privacy laws.Zack Whittaker, Patriot Act can \\"obtain\\" data in Europe, researchers say CBS News December 4, 2012 =Citizen complaint about Facebook data safety= In October 2015, the ECJ responded to a referral from the High Court of Ireland in relation to a complaint from Austrian citizen Maximillian Schrems regarding Facebook's processing of his personal data from its Irish subsidiary to servers in the US. Schrems complained that \\"in the light of the revelations made in 2013 by Edward Snowden concerning the activities of the United States intelligence services (in particular the National Security Agency ('the NSA')), the law and practice of the United States do not offer sufficient protection against surveillance by the public authorities\\". The ECJ held the Safe Harbour Principles to be invalid, as they did not require all organizations entitled to work with EU privacy-related data to comply with it, thus providing insufficient guarantees. US federal government agencies could use personal data under US law, but were not required to opt in. The court held that companies opting in were \\"bound to disregard, without limitation, the protective rules laid down by that scheme where they conflict with national security, public interest and law enforcement requirements\\". In accordance with the EU rules for referral to the ECJ for a 'preliminary ruling', the Irish Data Protection Commissioner since then has had to \\"...examine Mr. Schrems's case 'with all due diligence' and [...] decide whether [...] the transfer of Facebook's European subscribers' personal data to the United States should be suspended\\". EU regulators said that if the ECJ and United States did not negotiate a new system within three months, businesses might face action from European privacy regulators. On October 29, 2015, a new \\"Safe Harbour 2.0\\" agreement appeared close to being finalized. However Commissioner Jourova expects the U.S. to act next. American NGOs were quick to expand on the significance of the decision. =Response to EU–US Privacy Shield Agreement= German MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht and campaigner Max Schrems have criticized the new ruling, with the latter predicting that the Commission might be taking a \\"round-trip to Luxembourg\\" (where the European Court of Justice is located). EU Commissioner for Consumers, Vera Jourova, expressed confidence that a deal would be reached by the end of February. Many Europeans were demanding a mechanism for individual European citizens to lodge complaints over the use of their data, as well as a transparency scheme to assure that European citizens data did not fall into the hands of U.S intelligence agencies. The Article 29 Working Party has taken up this demand, and stated it would hold back another month until March 2016 to decide on consequences of Commissioner Jourova's new proposal. The European Commission’s Director for Fundamental Rights Paul Nemitz stated at a conference in Brussels in January how the Commission would decide on the \\"adequacy\\" of data protection. The Economist newspaper predicts that \\"once the Commission has issued a beefed-up 'adequacy decision', it will be harder for the ECJ to strike it down.\\" Privacy activist Joe McNamee summed up the situation by noting the Commission has announced agreements prematurely, thus forfeiting its negotiating right. At the same time, the first court challenges in Germany have commenced: the Hamburg data protection authority was during February 2016 preparing to fine three companies for relying on Safe Harbour as the legal basis for their transatlantic data transfers and two other companies were under investigation. From the other side a reaction looked imminent.

The film apparently had at least a limited American release through American-International Pictures Inc., but is best known from subsequent cable TV showings and home video sales. Plot Astronauts landing on Venus kill a creature that resembles a pterosaur which is worshiped by the local women. They attempt kill the astronauts by means of their superhuman powers, but fail.

One of the girls was afraid of sharks and when she was in the water they threw her a rubber fish; she got hysterical, grabbed the fish and bit its head off. He said that people did not understand the film and its new sequences when first cut together so he added narration.

Life Born in Münster, he initially worked on a farm before becoming a cabinetmaker. His carving was so clever and graceful that it attracted attention, and procured him the good will of some art patrons, who sent him to Berlin in 1831. There he studied under the direction of Christian Daniel Rauch, Tieck, and Johann Gottfried Schadow, then the foremost sculptors of Germany. Achtermann, however, being of a profoundly religious character, was drawn irresistibly to Rome, where he arrived in 1839 and remained until the end of his life. The first prominent product of his Roman studies was a Pietà which was secured for the Cathedral of Münster and which has often been copied. In 1858 the same cathedral acquired a group of seven life-size figures representing the descent from the Cross which is regarded as one of its chief art treasures. His last great work, finished when the artist had passed his seventieth year, was a Gothic altar triptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus. This was set up in the cathedral at Prague in the year 1873. He died in Rome in 1889. Achtermann's art is characterized by deep religious feeling and great imaginative power, although, on account of his having taken to an artistic career when somewhat advanced in life, he did not attain the technical mastery which he might otherwise have acquired.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 8, 2006. Mail from forty years earlier is discovered, and a letter from Homer Simpson's mother's old boyfriend states that he is Homer's true father. Homer sets out to find his supposed new father, leaving Abe Simpson behind. It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Mike B. Anderson. The episode guest stars William H. Macy and Joe Frazier as themselves, and Michael York as Homer's new father, Mason Fairbanks. Plot As Marge drives on a highway to go shopping, she finds a toll booth, but she and other Springfield residents drive through an adjacent forest trail to avoid paying. A week later, Mayor Quimby enforces tire spikes and blocks off the escape route, needing money to \\"de-python\\" the town fountain. When Marge comes up to the booth, she refuses to pay and backs up, blowing out many cars' tires, which are thrown in the tire fire. The heat and smoke from it melts ice on Mount Springfield and reveals a mailman frozen for 40 years. His letters contain many revelations and one is delivered to Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. It is from her old lifeguard boyfriend, whose name begins with an M, who writes that if Mona replies to the letter, she has chosen him, and if she does not, she is choosing to stick with her husband, Abe, and that either way, he knows the baby she is carrying is his. Wondering who his biological father really is, Homer goes to the library to look in \\"Lifeguards of Springfield in the Twentieth Century.\\" The only person in there whose name begins with M is Mason Fairbanks. Homer goes to his house posing a reporter, but eventually tells him he thinks he is his father, and Mason is delighted. He takes the Simpson family on a ride on his ship and tells them the story of the lost emerald treasure of Piso Mojado, which impresses them. However, when they come home, Grampa angrily accuses Mason of having tried to steal his wife and now trying to steal his family, and is saddened Homer would even think that Mason could be his real father. They have a DNA test, and after a suspenseful wait, Homer is thrilled to learn his real father is Mason Fairbanks. While Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have an awkward, uneventful visit with Grampa, Mason and Homer are underwater in individual submarines looking for the lost treasure. Homer gets separated from Mason, and he follows a small light, thinking it is him. It is actually a glowing fish, and Homer gets stuck in some coral. As his oxygen begins to run out and he starts to lose consciousness, he sees poignant flashbacks of himself and Abe. After three days in a coma, Homer wakes up in a hospital, tells Abe of his memories, and says he considers Abe his real father. Abe then reveals he switched the labels on the DNA samples after seeing how happy Homer was with Mason and the fully confirmed biological father-son duo share a hug. Reception Mike B. Anderson (pictured) directed the episode. Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad gives the episode a strong positive rating, quoting its ingenuity and charm.

The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Retailing Co., Ltd. History Uniqlo flagship store in Shinsaibashisuji, Osaka =Origins in Japan= A Yamaguchi-based company, Ogori Shōji (which, until then, had been operating men's clothing shops called \\"Men's Shop OS\\") was founded in March 1949 in Ube, Yamaguchi. In May 1984, it opened a unisex casual wear store in Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima, under the name \\"Unique Clothing Warehouse\\". Initially, the brand was going to be registered as a shortened contraction of \\"unique clothing\\". However, in 1988, during administration work in Hong Kong for registering the brand, staff in charge of registration misread the \\"C\\" as \\"Q\\", and that is how the brand name was born. Tadashi Yanai then changed the store name to \\"uniqlo\\" across Japan. In September 1991, the name of the company was changed from \\"Ogori Shōji\\" to \\"Fast Retailing\\", and by April 1994, there were over 100 Uniqlo stores operating throughout Japan. =Private-label strategy= In 1997, Fast Retailing adopted a set of strategies from American retailer The Gap, known as \\"SPA\\" (for specialty-store/retailer of private- label apparel), meaning that they would produce their own clothing and sell it exclusively. They engaged the retail brand consultancy, CIA, Inc./The Brand Architect Group, to guide the company through the realization of this strategy, including consulting on merchandise, visual merchandising and display, store design and a new logo designed by Richard Seireeni and Sy Chen of The Brand Architect Group's Los Angeles office. Uniqlo had begun outsourcing their clothing manufacturing to factories in China where labour was cheap, a well-established corporate practice. Japan was in the depths of a recession at the time, and the low-cost goods proved popular. Their advertising campaigns, clothing quality and new retail layouts also proved fruitful. In November 1998, it opened their first urban Uniqlo store in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku district, and outlets soon spread to major cities throughout Japan. In 2001, sales turnover and gross profit reached a new peak, with over 500 retail stores in Japan. When Uniqlo decided to expand overseas, it separated Uniqlo from the parent company, and established Fast Retailing (Jiangsu) Apparel Co., Ltd. in China. In 2002 their first Chinese Uniqlo outlet was opened in Shanghai along with four overseas outlets in London, England. 2005 saw more overseas expansion, with stores opening in the United States (New York City), Hong Kong (Tsim Sha Tsui) and South Korea (Seoul), their South Korean expansion being part of a joint venture with Lotte. As of year-end 2005, in addition to its overseas holdings, Uniqlo had around 700 stores within Japan. By 2006 sales were $4 billion. By April 2007, the company had set a global sales goal of $10 billion and a ranking among the top five global retailers, joining what at the time was Gap, H&M;, Inditex, and Limited Brands.

Its newest store in Thailand is at Samyan Mitrtown, opened on 15 November 2019. =Spain= Uniqlo began operations in Spain in 2016 with its online store, and in September 2017 opened its flagship store in Barcelona (Passeig de Gràcia). It also owns two more stores in Barcelona and one store in Madrid. =United Kingdom= As of 2019, Uniqlo had 13 shops in England. Ambitious expansion plans in the early 2000s were reversed, with 16 shops being closed in 2003, including those in Manchester, Coventry, and Leicester. Uniqlo opened a brand new shop in Manchester on Market Street in April 2019. =United States= Uniqlo's flagship store in Chicago on the Magnificent Mile In September 2005, Uniqlo opened its first United States store in the Menlo Park Mall located in Edison, New Jersey. In November 2006, Uniqlo opened its first store in the SoHo fashion district of Manhattan, New York City. New fashion designers joined the store's team to boost and rebirth fashion concepts catering to the US market. As part of Fast Retailing's 2020 plan, the company has stated that it plans to generate $10 billion in annual sales in the United States from 200 stores, which will lead to a location in every major U.S. city. This goal was stated when the company's only U.S. presence was its handful of stores in the New York City area, soon after the company began an expansion in the United States. In October 2015, Uniqlo opened its first store in the Midwest with a Chicago store on Michigan Avenue. In October 2019, Uniqlo signed a lease for its first North American distribution center in Phillipsburg, NJ, leasing a space of over 950,000 sq ft. =Vietnam= Uniqlo opened its first store in Ho Chi Minh city in December 2019. The store is located in Parkson Dong Khoi with three floors. As of July 2020, Uniqlo had two stores in Ho Chi Minh city and one store in Ha Noi. =Denmark= Uniqlo opened its first store in Denmark in April 2019. It is located on Strøget in central Copenhagen. The store includes three storeys. =Sweden= The first Uniqlo store in Sweden opened in August 2018 in Stockholm and covers three storeys. Controversies In January 2015, a number of labor rights violations were reported at Uniqlo suppliers in China. Uniqlo pledged to remedy the violations. In June 2015, Uniqlo factory workers went on strike in relation to lay-offs. In November 2015, investigations into the measures Uniqlo introduced in the wake of the January 2015 revelations found that the remedies had been only partially successful, with significant violations continuing to occur. In October 2016, the report This Way to Dystopia: Exposing UNIQLO's Abuse of Chinese Garment Workers by SACOM and War on Want claimed that it was still the case that \\"excessive overtime, low pay, dangerous working conditions and oppressive management\\" were common in Uniqlo factories in China and Cambodia. In 2019, a number of Australian workers reported that bullying and harassment is rife, there were \\"shouting rooms\\", and a toxic work culture. They claimed they had to work 18-hour days, had to fold seven shirts per minute, and that everyone leaves with \\"some form of PTSD\\". Window sign in Shinjuku, 2010.

Many introductory programming and systems analysis texts introduce this as the most basic structure for describing a process.Grady, J. O., \\"System Engineering Planning and Enterprise Identity,\\" Taylor & Francis, 1995 .Goel, A., \\"Computer Fundamentals,\\" Pearson Education India, 2010.Zelle, J., \\"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, 2nd edition,\\" Franklin, Beedle, & Associates, 2010.Curry, A. and Flett, P. and Hollingsworth, I., \\"Managing Information and Systems: The Business Perspective,\\" Routledge, 2006.  Overview  A computer program is useful for another sort of process using the input-process-output model receives inputs from a user or other source, does some computations on the inputs, and returns the results of the computations. In essence the system separates itself from the environment, thus defining both inputs and outputs as one united mechanism. Waring A. Practical Systems Thinking, International Thomson Business Press: London. (1996) The system would divide the work into three categories: * A requirement from the environment (input) * A computation based on the requirement (process) * A provision for the environment (output) In other words, such inputs may be materials, human resources, money or information, transformed into outputs, such as consumables, services, new information or money. As a consequence, an Input-Process-Output system becomes very vulnerable to misinterpretation. This is because, theoretically, it contains all the data, in regards to the environment outside the system. Yet, in practice, the environment contains a significant variety of objects that a system is unable to comprehend, as it exists outside the system's control. As a result, it is very important to understand where the boundary lies between the system and the environment, which is beyond the system's understanding. Various analysts often set their own boundaries, favoring their point of view, thus creating much confusion.  Systems at work  The views differ, in regards to systems thinking. One of such definitions would outline the Input- process-output system, as a structure, would be: \\"Systems thinking is the art and science of making reliable inferences about behaviour by developing an increasingly deep understanding of the understanding of the underlying structure\\"B. Richmond: Introduction to Systems Thinking, STELLA®© 1992-1997 Alternatively, it was also suggested that systems are not 'holistic' in the sense of bonding with remote objects (for example: trying to connect a crab, ozone layer and capital life cycle together).M. Balle: Managing With Systems Thinking: Making Dynamics Work for You in Business Decision Making 1996  Types of systems  There are five major categories that are the most cited in information systems literature:P. B. Checkland: Systems Thinking, Systems Practice. 1981 .B. Wilson Systems: Concepts, methodologies and applications ( 1984) = Natural systems = A system which has not been created as a result of human interference. Examples of such would be the solar system as well as the human body, evolving into its current form = Designed physical systems = A system which has been created as a result of human interference, and is physically identifiable. Examples of such would be various computing machines, created by human mind for some specific purpose. = Designed abstract systems = A system which has been created as a result of human interference, and is not physically identifiable. Examples of such would be mathematical and philosophical systems, which have been created by human minds, for some specific purpose. There are also some social systems, which allow humans to collectively achieve a specific purpose. = Social systems = A system created by humans, and derived from intangible purposes. For example: a family, that is a hierarchy of human relationships, which in essence create the boundary between natural and human systems. = Human activity systems = An organisation with hierarchy, created by humans for a specific purpose. For example: a company, which organises humans together to collaborate and achieve a specific purpose. The result of this system is physically identifiable. There are, however, some significant links between with previous types. It is clear that the idea of human activity system (HAS), would consist of a variety of smaller social system, with its unique development and organisation. Moreover, arguably HASes can include designed systems - computers and machinery. Majority of previous systems would overlap.  System characteristics  There are several key characteristics, when it comes to the fundamental behaviour of any system. # Systems can be classified as open or closed:' #* Those that interact with their environment, in form of money, data, energy or exchange materials, are generally understood as open. Openness of the system can vary significantly. This is because, a system would be classified as open, if it receives even a single input from the environment, yet a system that merely interacts with the environment, would be classified as open as well. The more open the system is, the more complex it normally would be, due to lower predictability of its components. #* Those that have no interactions with the environment at all are closed. In practice, however, a completely closed system is merely liveable, due to loss of practical usage of the output. As a result, most of the systems would be open or open to a certain extent.Patching D. (1990) Practical Soft Systems Analysis # Systems can be classified as deterministic or stochastic: #* Well-defined and clearly structured system in terms of behavioural patterns becomes predictable, thus becoming deterministic. In other words it would only use empirical data. For example: mathematics or physics are set around specific laws, which make the results of calculation predictable. Deterministic systems would have simplistic interactions between inner components. #* More complex, and often more open systems, would have relatively lower extent of predictability, due to absence of clearly structured behavioural patterns. Analysing such system, is therefore much harder. Such systems would be stochastic, or probabilistic, this is because of the stochastic nature of human beings whilst performing various activities. Having said that, designed systems would still be considered as deterministic, due to a rigid structure of rules incorporated into the design. # Systems can be classified as static or dynamic #* Most systems would be known as dynamic, because of the constant evolution in computing power, yet some systems could find it hard to balance between being created and ceasing to exist. An example of such could be a printed map, which is not evolving, in contrast to a dynamic map, provided from constantly updating developers. # Systems can be classified as self-regulating or non- self-regulatingFlynn D.J. (1992) Information Systems Requirements: Determination and Analysis #* The greater the extent of self-control of systems activity is, the greater is the liveability of the final system is. It is vital for any system to be able to control its activities in order to remain stable.  Real life applications  = Corporate business = * A manufacturing processes that take raw materials as inputs, applies a manufacturing process, and produces manufactured goods as output. The usage of such systems could help to create stronger human organisations, in terms of company operations in each and every department of the firm, no matter the size, which . IPOs can also restructure existing static and non-self- regulating systems, which in real world would be used in form of outsourcing the product fulfilment, due to inefficiency of current fulfilment.Martin C. and Powell P. (1992) Informational Systems. A Management Perspective = Programming = * The majority of existing programs for coding, such as Java, Python, C++, would be based upon a deterministic IPO model, with clear inputs coming from the coder, converting into outputs, such as applications. * A batch transaction processing system, which accepts large volumes of homogeneous transactions, processes it (possibly updating a database), and produces output such as reports or computations. * An interactive computer program, which accepts simple requests from a user and responds to them after some processing and/or database accesses. = Scientific = * A calculator, which uses inputs, provided by the operator, and processes them into outputs to be used by the operator. * A thermostat, which senses the temperature (input), decides on an action (heat on/off), and executes the action (output).http://smallbusiness.chron.com/use-ipo-model-37493.html  See also  *Read–eval–print loop *Extract, transform, load * CIPO-model  References  Information systems ","title":"IPO model"},{"id":"3526361","text":"Songs from the Crystal Cave is the debut album from actor, musician, and martial artist Steven Seagal, released in 2005 on Nonsolo Blues and Warner Strategic Marketing.

History =Early history= Prior to its opening in 1951, there was no high school in Bettendorf. High school-age students living in the city had to go to Davenport High School or Le Claire High School to receive their secondary education. The original BHS building was completed in 1951 at a site between 21st and 23rd streets south of Central Avenue. In its very early years, the high school housed seventh through 12th grade students, although junior high students were moved by the late 1950s. The community of Bettendorf quickly grew during the 1950s and 1960s, and by the early 1960s, the district had outgrown the school due to increasing enrollment. Students walked to some classes in rented store fronts on State and Grant Streets, while an annex building (which later became Neil Armstrong Elementary) also helped serve students. By 1971, with enrollment still growing at a fast pace, plans were started to build a new high school along 18th Street in the northern part of the city, roughly 1½ miles north of Middle Road. The former BHS building had a track/baseball field on the front side and a football field on the back side; both are still evident at the site. The old school's athletic facilities were used for a number of years after the opening of the new high school. The old football field was used on a varsity level until 1980, when Touvelle Stadium was completed, while the old BHS gymnasium was utilized by lower level teams until the mid-1980s. Today, the old BHS building is the headquarters for the Mississippi Bend Area Education Agency District 9, which oversees public school education across east-central Iowa. =Current high school= The current high school building was completed in 1973, at a cost of roughly $3 million. At the time of its opening, BHS was on the edge of town, surrounded by mostly undeveloped land. A subsequent addition added a new industrial arts/locker room and an athletic stadium completed in 1980. The six-building, air-conditioned complex is highlighted by a landscaped inner courtyard, planetarium, library/media center, computer labs, a 405-seat auditorium, and a field house with a 6-lane, 25-yard swimming pool. In 2007, an addition to the music and drama area was completed. A new facility is attached to the east side of the high school and accessible to all athletic and physical education areas. The center houses weights and exercise and cardiovascular equipment. A group of community members organized the BHS Fitness Education Center Committee and raised $300,000 in funds for the fitness education center at Bettendorf High School. The Bettendorf School Board matched $300,000 to fund the $600,000 project. The project was completed in the summer of 2002. In 2010, copies of the student newspaper, The Growl, were confiscated by school administrators because of an article about inconsistent disciplinary action against students, specifically athletes. Renovations to the high school took about three years to complete from October 2011 to March 2013, with an estimated cost of $16.2 million.Bettendorf High School - Facility ProjectsCurtain goes up on performing arts center at Bettendorf High School A $3.25 million renovation project to TouVelle Stadium began in May and finished in August, in time for the 2014 season.

United States All federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Many U.S. States have divided their courts between criminal and civil, with some making further divisions, assigning probate, family law, and juvenile cases, for example, to specialized courts. General jurisdiction and judicial immunity One significant effect of the classification of a court is the liability that a judge from that court might face for stepping beyond the bounds of that court. Judges are able to claim judicial immunity for acts that are not completely beyond their jurisdiction. For example, if a probate judge were to sentence a person to jail, that judge would not have immunity and could be sued because a probate judge has no jurisdiction to effect a criminal sentence. However, a judge in a court of general jurisdiction who happened to be overseeing a probate case would be immune from suit for sending a party to jail, because handing down a criminal sentence is not completely beyond the jurisdiction of such a judge. In the United States, this principle was established by the Supreme Court in Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978). The Court found in that case that an Indiana judge was immune from a suit brought by a young woman whom the judge had ordered to be sterilized, at the behest of the woman's mother. Because the Indiana court was a court of general jurisdiction, and no law of Indiana expressly prohibited the judge from issuing such an order, the Supreme Court found that the order was not completely beyond the jurisdiction of that judge.

It sits on a tract of land off Lincoln Avenue that was bought with money donated by Francis Joseph Reitz in 1922 in memory of his parents, John Augustus and Gertrude Reitz. The school officially opened its doors on January 5, 1925. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Evansville. History In 1922 Francis Joseph Reitz pledged one million dollars for the school to be built, for which he was presented with the insignia of Knight and Knight Commander of the Order of Pius IX. The original, main building was built three stories high of Ohio gray brick and elaborate trimmings of Indiana limestone with a Tudor- Gothic design. On New Year’s Day, 1925, Reitz Memorial High School, with its 18 classrooms, auditorium that was used as a gymnasium as well, cafeteria, library, candy store, parlor, and large recreation room, was dedicated by Bishop Chartrand of Indianapolis. Classes began on January 5, 1925 with the Brothers of The Holy Cross from Notre Dame University teaching the boys and the Sisters of Providence teaching the girls, each on separate floors. In 1969, a new addition was completed. The new wing extending along Bennighof Avenue came with expanded first and second floors, a new gym, band room, and library. The new gym could hold up to 2,000 people. In 1998, a new addition, costing roughly $5 million was added to the western part of the building.

Richards has the distinction of being the first person ever to be a cast member on both Saturday Night Live (SNL) and its rival sketch show, MADtv. He is perhaps best known for his frequent SNL character \\"Drunk Girl\\". As a standup comedian, Richards has opened for the likes of Chris Kattan, Andrew Dice Clay, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Louie Anderson, and Andy Dick. He has appeared as a guest on Marc Maron's WTF podcast as well as on Aqua Teen Hunger Force and NBC's Late Night. Early years Richards was born in Walnut Creek, California and attended Las Lomas High School. At age 17, he created and hosted his own public access sketch comedy show called Hanson Live. He later worked for KVHS, a student-run radio station which broadcasts from Clayton Valley High School.KVHS Alumni Retrieved September 3, 2011 He then attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and, in his senior year, he joined the improvisational comedy team CHiPs Improv. Fellow CHiPs member Zach Ward brought Richards to the comedy club Charlie Goodnights in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he performed at an open mic show; Richards would eventually go on to host at the club. After graduating from UNC, Richards moved to Los Angeles to further develop his comedy career. Career After moving to LA, Richards worked the door at The Comedy Store and eventually started to perform stand-up. In 2000, Richards became a featured player in the cast of MADtv, appearing in 3 episodes of the show's 6th season. The following year Richards joined the cast of Saturday Night Live during its 27th season, giving him the distinction of being the first person to be a cast-member of both sketch comedy shows (Taran Killam would later become the only other performer to do so). Richards was promoted to repertory status for SNL's 29th season although he left the show after the 10th episode, which aired on January 17, 2004. In interviews, Richards has stated that he left the show on his own terms. Perhaps Richards' most popular character on SNL was \\"Drunk Girl\\", who appeared on the Weekend Update segment nine times. He based the character on an audience member he encountered while performing stand-up at The Comedy Store in La Jolla, California. In 2004 Richards appeared in the Comedy Central year-end retrospective special Last Laugh '04 as Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly. In 2006 he again portrayed O'Reilly in episode of Mind of Mencia titled \\"Carlos Smoov\\". In 2007 he appeared on episode 22 of Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen along with comics Jeff Jena, Natasha Leggero, and Mike Epps.Jeff Richards on Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen . Retrieved September 3, 2011 Richards has also done voice work which includes characters in the 2004 video game EverQuest II, a character in the 2006 MTV animated series Where My Dogs At? and in 2010 he played the voice of Brad Pitt in an episode titled \\"\\"The Wedding\\" of the FOX sitcom 'Til Death. Richards produced a comedic album titled A$$WAX which was released on iTunes on March 3, 2009;A$$WAX on iTunes a portion of the proceeds from the album's sales was used to fight world hunger. Richard also performed in a series of comedy benefit shows called \\"Asswax 4 Hunger\\" in 2009; the shows were hosted by friend Kato Kaelin. Richards and Kaelin also hosted a podcast called In Pod We Trust in 2011. In 2009 Richards played the character of Jerome Murphy in episode 3 of the ABC science fiction series FlashForward. That same year Richards appeared in the pilot episode of a sitcom created by comedian Bill Burr called The Burr Effect which appeared on Comedy Central; the series did not get picked up by the network. Over his career Jeff has also appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.

A mirror mount is a device that holds a mirror. In optics research, these can be quite sophisticated devices, due to the need to be able to tip and tilt the mirror by controlled amounts, while still holding it in a precise position when it is not being adjusted. An optical mirror mount generally consists of a movable front plate which holds the mirror, and a fixed back plate with adjustment screws. Adjustment screws drive the front plate about the axes of rotation in the pitch (vertical) and yaw (horizontal) directions. An optional third actuator often enables z-axis translation. Precision mirror mounts can be quite expensive, and a notable amount of engineering goes into their design. Such sophisticated mounts are often required for lasers, interferometers, and optical delay lines. Types of mirror mount A kinematic mount, showing some of the mechanism. The most common type of mirror mount is the kinematic mount. This type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy. Typically, the movable frame that holds the mirror pivots on a ball bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame. Ideally this hole should be trihedral (pyramid- shaped). Often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture. The frame is pivoted by means of two micrometers or fine-thread screws, tipped with steel ball bearings. One of these ball bearings rests in a V-groove, the other rests on a flat surface. On cheaper mounts, the flat surface may be simply the material of the mount. In more expensive mounts, the flat surface (and perhaps the hole and v-groove too) may be made out of a much harder material (often sapphire), set into the frame. The reason for this strange mechanism, is that the first ball (ideally) makes contact with the fixed frame at exactly three points, the second ball at two, and the third ball at just one. These six points of contact exactly constrain the six degrees of freedom for motion of the movable frame. This leads to precise movement of the frame when the micrometers or screws are turned, without unnecessary wobble or friction. A disadvantage of kinematic mounts is that the center of the mirror moves along its normal axis, when the mirror is rotated. This is because the center of rotation is the middle of the first ball bearing, not the center of the mirror. For optical cavities and interferometers, it is often desirable to be able to align the mirrors separately from adjustments to the length of the cavity. For these applications and others, a more sophisticated mount is required. A caricature of a gimbal mount aka cardanic mount, showing all but the threads. One way of eliminating this translation along the axis is to set the first ball on a fine-thread screw as well. By appropriate adjustment of all three screws, the mirror can be tilted in either direction without translation. The screws can by driven by a motor under computer control to make this seem to the operator like simple rotation about a virtual pivot point in the center of the mirror surface. The translation can instead be eliminated mechanically by using a gimbal mount, which uses two rings that each pivot about a line running through the center of the mirror. This gives kinematically-correct two-axis rotation about the center of the mirror. With both types of mount, springs are needed to keep the frame pressed against the ball bearings, unless the mount is designed to be used only in an orientation where gravity will keep the frame in place. Following the cantilever principle, a large mount allows finer control than a smaller one. The frames are ideally made of a light material, to make the resonant frequency of the structure high. This reduces vibration, since many common sources of vibration are relatively low frequency. For stability, the fixed frame is supported by a rigid mount that is securely bolted to a supporting surface. In a laboratory environment, this is typically an optical table. A shock can cause the mount to move away from the ball bearings, but because there are only 6, hard contacts, the mirror will return to the original position, preserving the alignment. The mount itself has to avoid deformation of the mounted optics. Stress from mounting can introduce aberration in the light reflected from a mirror, or photoelasticity inside a lens. In some lasers the mirrors have to be easily replaced, in which case the mount needs to be designed to allow the mirror to be removed and replaced without losing correct alignment. Operation The fine-thread screws show a slip and stick behaviour; when used manually, a torque is applied with two fingers until the thread slips a bit, then the new position is read on a scale. Inexpensive screws do long slips and lack a scale. Precision micrometers perform better and provide a scale for reference. When used remotely, an electric motor is used to apply short pulses of torque. The motor is firmly connected with the screw and the thread and nothing else so that the pulse is absorbed by friction. To read out the position electronically, a rotary encoder is attached. When the ball is not completely centered on the screw and the axis is not normal to the mirror surface (which is an explicit feature of some convenience mirror mounts), a small sinus movement of the mirror is overlaid onto the linear movement, which a controller could compensate for. For analog fine control (5 nm), piezos are built into the mobile frame. Applications Mirror mounts holding two broadband dielectric mirrors. Laser cavity end mirrors need very precise alignment. Due to their low divergence laser beams need precise steering mirrors. For rapid prototyping on an optical table mirror mounts can be used to hold other elements besides mirrors, for example lenses often need to be aligned for minimal coma. Sometimes prisms only need two axes alignment and can be mounted on a mirror mount rather than a three-axis prism table. Critical phase matched crystals can be aligned and tuned precisely with a standard mirror mount. The same is true for small etalons, retarders and polarizers. Furthermore, mirror mounts using magnets instead of springs allow the mobile frame to be removed and later replaced in exactly the same position. Related devices *Although rotation can be achieved by a semi gimbal mount most rotation stages are not designed based on the principles of kinematic determinacy. *A linear motion bearing or linear stage having kinematic determinacy uses two V-grooves sliding on a cylinder, a flat surface sliding on a second parallel cylinder, and a flat surface joining the screw. *The hexapod known from flight simulators allows motion with six degrees of freedom. For kinematic determinacy each leg consists of a ball set in a trihedral hole in the fixed frame, a ball joining a flat plate in the fixed frame, and a ball joining a trihedral hole in the mobile frame. The mobile part of the leg is connected with a thread which runs in thread of the fixed part. *A screw-thread join gets kinematic determinacy the same way as any other rotation bearing. *The ball bearing and cylindrical roller bearing are over-determined, having more points of contact than required for kinematic determinacy. This leads to decreased precision as the joints wear. *The flexure bearing and piezoelectric element offer higher precision than other mechanical bearings.

The top combatant is referred to as having side control, and is in a stable position, with the other combatant pinned beneath him or her. From there the top combatant can proceed with elbows, knees, various submissions, or transition into a mounted position. It is high priority for the bottom combatant to sweep the top combatant or otherwise escape the position, for instance by entangling the opponent's free legs and trying to obtain the half guard or guard. Kata-gatame The kata gatame (肩固, \\"shoulder hold\\") is a pinning hold where the opponent is hugged around the head, with one of the opponent's arms pinned against his or her neck. It can be done from kesa- gatame in response to an opponent's escape attempt, during which the arm is pinned against his or her neck, and the hold around the neck is put in place. The kata-gatame is often seen as a chokehold, since it is easy to compress the opponent's neck from the hold by squeezing, in which case it is known as an arm triangle choke or side choke.

Transitions and submission holds are comparatively difficult to perform effectively from this position, instead a variation of this hold is used called kuzure-kesa-gatame (崩袈裟固) or \\"modified scarf hold\\". This hold is similar to the kesa-gatame, except that instead of encircling the head, the opponent's arm is encircled.

Ideal twister side control is achieved from traditional side control by facing away from the opponents head, sitting on their bicep, placing the small of your back on their chin and trapping their other arm behind your elbow, pushing it towards their head. A key component to twister side control is keeping your hip off the ground, this is important to help keep weight down on the opponent. This will leave you with a free hand that you can use to block the opponents legs from attacking or keep posture. Twister side control is usually known as a position which favors attacking the legs. However, the upper body can be attacked with submissions such as the baby arm, kimura, d'arce, etc. In addition, the tip-toe transition to mount is an extremely high percentage pass and considered one of the easiest in jiu-jitsu. Twister side control is named after the a transition, from the position, which enables you to transition to the truck and perform a twister a.k.a. guillotine, but it also allows you to attack for kneebars and calf cranks.

It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, allows easy access to cylinder valves, provides easy and reliable gas redundancy, and tanks can be easily removed when necessary. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who conducted technical wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving is now growing in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and is becoming an increasingly popular specialty training for recreational diving, with several diver certification agencies offering recreational and technical level sidemount training programs.  Terminology  Sidemount diver using an OMS Profile adapted wing BCD ;Sidemount diving: Sidemount diving is the practice of diving with two or more cylinders secured at the sides of the body in line with the torso and without cylinders on the diver's back. A common characteristic of the sidemount configuration is the use of bungee cords hooked over the cylinder valve to keep it tucked in close to the armpit. These bungees are normally routed from behind the diver's upper back to a chest D-ring. The lower part of the cylinder is secured to the diver's harness near the waist or hips by bolt snaps clipped to a butt-plate or waistband D-rings. ;Sidemounting stages: Sidemount stages is the practice of using sidemount configuration (bungee loops and/or buttplate rails) as a means for stowing stage/deco cylinders in a streamlined manner against the sides of the torso, when otherwise diving in back-mounted doubles or CCR. ;Monkey diving: Monkey diving is the use of sidemount configuration and procedures with a single cylinder. It is presented as an option on some recreational level sidemount courses (dependent on agency) and may also be a considered strategy for some overhead- environment (cave/wreck) penetrations. The use of a single cylinder may require counter-weighting to prevent lateral instability in the water, depending on the buoyancy of the chosen cylinder, and does not provide a redundant gas supply. ;No-mount diving: No-mount diving is a specialized overhead-environment strategy for dealing with particularly tight restrictions. This may involve divers wearing a very basic harness under their existing configuration, or simply hand-carrying cylinders. Upon reaching a restriction through which they couldn't otherwise pass, they will ‘strip down’ out of their primary gear, hand-hold or attach a cylinder/s to their ‘no- mount’ harness and move forwards. A ‘no-mount’ harness can consist of nothing more than a weight-belt with several D-rings attached. The evolution of sidemount techniques and configurations has largely made this approach unnecessary, as a minimalist sidemount harness/BCD can be worn beneath back- mounted doubles, or even a CCR.  Benefits  Sidemount diver partially removes (forward rotates) both primary cylinders to permit passage through a restriction in a wreck. = Flexibility = Sidemount diving offers some benefits in the flexibility of equipment. Cylinders suitable for sidemount diving are usually freely available for rental, unlike manifolded twin sets for back-mounted use, which allows the traveller to conduct technical or overhead environment dives without having to source twin cylinder sets. When diving in remote locations, the transportation of single diving cylinders, especially by hand, may be less physically taxing. Sidemount harness can be lighter and less bulky than back-mounted alternatives – allowing for easier and cheaper air travel. = Accessibility = Unlike back-mounted cylinders, the sidemount diver has immediate access to, and can see, the regulators and tank valves of their cylinders. This enables quicker and more certain problem identification and resolution, without requiring ‘behind the head’ shut-down drills that require a higher level of joint and suit flexibility and the ability to identify and correctly operate equipment which is out of sight. = Low profile = Sidemount diving configuration places the cylinders under the diver's armpits, in line with their body, allowing the diver to pass through smaller restrictions than would be possible with back-mounted cylinders. The ability to remove tanks and push them in front allows the diver to pass through very small passages and holes when penetration diving – being limited only by the bulk of their bodies and diving suits. Streamlining for reduced drag while swimming is not always achieved. = Safety = Increased accessibility to regulator first-stages and cylinder valves improves efficiency and speed of critical cylinder shut-down procedures, allows immediate gas-loss identification and provides the diver with quick access to alternative contingency procedures, such as swapping regulators between cylinders, manual operation of a cylinder valve to control gas flow through a regulator which is free-flowing, or to allow breathing directly from the tank valve. Mounting the cylinders at the diver's sides reduces exposure of valves and regulator first-stages to impact and abrasion damage, or accidental shut- down through roll-off against a ceiling. It also significantly reduces the risk of entanglement behind the diver, where it is most difficult to rectify. = Comfort = Some divers will testify that sidemount diving configuration offers greater stability and easier-to-attain trim and control in the water. It is also claimed to be less physically tiring to carry, and get into, sidemount equipment than back-mounted doubles – especially when operating from a small boat or a rough shore entry. The ability to attach, remove and replace cylinders while in the water allows the diver to avoid carrying twinned cylinders. The reduced physical exertion when conducting regulator shut-down procedures is a major benefit to divers who suffer from shoulder or back discomfort or reduced mobility. = Redundancy of gas = Technical divers have generally used a redundant gas supply system, either isolation-manifolded or independent back-mounted cylinders. Recreational divers have traditionally resorted to using buddy supplied gas, or relatively small bailout ‘pony cylinders’ or ‘ascent bottles’ for out-of-air emergencies. Whether attached to the primary cylinder, or slung at the chest, these cylinders often present problems with stability and streamlining, whilst not always providing more than a bare minimum supply of air for emergency ascent. Sidemount diving with two equal-sized cylinders helps resolve stability and streamlining issues, and can ensure that an adequate redundant reserve of air is maintained, similar to back-mounted twins. Back-mounted manifolded cylinders provide easy access to the whole gas supply in the event of a regulator failure and shut-down. However, the manifold itself creates additional potential o-ring failure points, and a major leak at the manifold will deprive the diver of at least one-half of the remaining gas supply. Independent cylinders, when sidemounted, provide more reliable gas redundancy, and allow greater access to all remaining gas by switching regulators between cylinders or feather breathing, provided the diver is competent at the additional skills required.) Problems Sidemount diving can increase the task loading on the diver, and can cause more drag when swimming, depending on which alternative configuration is compared. The diver's head may be more vulnerable to impact with the overhead, due to lack of the back gas set. This may be mitigated by the use of a helmet.  Sidemount for the recreational diver  Sidemount diver removes a cylinder on ascent. The benefits for cave diving and wreck diving with tight penetrations are largely accepted, but they are not so obvious for the typical recreational diver. Most recreational divers rely on their buddy for bailout gas, and do not carry a redundant gas supply. The position of the cylinder valve behind the head has proven to be reasonably safe in millions of dives, though some divers do have physical difficulty reaching the valve while wearing the set, particularly if the cylinder is mounted relatively low on the harness. Though sidemount divers may benefit from being easily able to see and manipulate valves, first stages or cylinders, this is rarely required in recreational use. In single cylinder diving there is seldom a reason to shut a cylinder valve while diving, and there is no need for changing cylinders or managing different gases. The recreational diver with a single cylinder is not supposed to enter low overhead spaces, so the single valve behind the diver's head is unlikely to come into contact with objects which might roll it closed. Divers with back problems often benefit from sidemounting, since the weight is transferred from the spine to the hips and shoulders and the back is kept less rigid. Furthermore, sidemount divers benefit from an increased gas supply, potentially allowing longer dives. Tucking the cylinders under the arms reduces water resistance, potentially increasing kick efficiency. Sidemount divers using two cylinders will generally benefit from improved stability and balance due to the lowered center of gravity relative to backmount divers and improved trim due to the more adjustable designs of common sidemount harnesses. When using a single cylinder in sidemount some of that benefit is negated since balance is off, though with an aluminium cylinder and proper body tension single cylinder sidemount diving is easier and more comfortable than many divers expect. Transportation on the surface can be easier either with backmount or with sidemount, depending on requirements. Carrying weight on the back is less stressful on the spine than carrying it to one side when out of the water, so for carrying a single cylinder, a backpack-style backmount BCD can be more comfortable. A heavy twinset can be unwieldy and heavy on the back though. In the case of sidemount, the two cylinders can be carried separately, distributing load and making transport on rough ground easier. Sidemount divers generally have more options available for donning and doffing than backmount divers, since they can choose to don or doff their single or double cylinders either on the surface or while in the water, depending on preference and conditions. Individual cylinders can be passed to and from a boat crew or a buddy on shore who is not burdened by gear, or lowered and raised by a line. In rougher conditions, cylinders can be prepared for hand-off below the surface and quickly passed to boat crew or attached to a line for later retrieval.  History  = The 1960s - UK sump diving = The concept of sidemounting cylinders originated from cave diving in the UK, during the 1960s. During 'dry' explorations of Wookey Hole, the River Axe and other underground systems, divers occasionally encountered submerged passages that blocked further exploration. These cavers began incorporating scuba equipment specifically to progress beyond underwater areas. However, because they operated in very confined spaces, and most exploration remained primarily 'dry', they began experimenting and improvising with extremely minimalist configurations, minimising bulk, allowing cylinders to be easily removed and replaced, and retaining the capacity to squeeze through the tightest restrictions. The nature of these 'dives' in cramped sumps did not prioritize the need for buoyancy control or underwater propulsion – so the bare minimum needed was a mask, a cylinder, a regulator, a method of attachment to the body and, only on rare occasions, a set of fins. Many of these early sump explorers adopted an approach based upon a sturdy belt, with attached cam-band, that allowed a cylinder to be dropped in and carried alongside the outer thigh. This allowed them to crawl, or wriggle, through the dry cave sections, whilst presenting a secure method of attachment for passing through submerged areas. Swimming efficiency, reduced water resistance, trim and buoyancy control were not generally required due to the nature of those caves. At the time, this approach to 'wet' cave exploration was generally called the 'English System'. = The 1970s - Florida = During the 1970s the 'English system' began to be incorporated by American cave divers, operating in Florida. Those cave systems were predominantly flooded and involved prolonged swimming with SCUBA; thus more emphasis was paid towards developing the diving performance of the system, in particular buoyancy and trim. Divers required buoyancy control devices for extended finning and began shifting the location of the cylinders from against the thigh, up to the armpit and against the torso. These exploratory level cave divers began by making their own systems, using and adapting 'off-the-shelf' SCUBA equipment for their needs or creating configurations ‘from scratch’, based upon webbing harnesses and improvised bladders for buoyancy. = The 1990s - release of first commercial rig = In the mid-1990s Lamar Hires designed the first commercial sidemount diving system and this was manufactured by Dive Rite. Dive Rite focused on the newly released 'Transpac' harness. Other cave divers continued to manufacture their own DIY configurations. At this time, the use of sidemounted configuration was primarily restricted to a small number of exploration-grade cave pioneers. = The 2000s - cave diving popularity and sidemount evolution = In 2001 Brett Hemphill designed the Armadillo Side-Mount Harness. The Armadillo innovated several features that would be utilized in many future side-mount harness designs ; Butt anchoring rear attachment pad, Cylinder bungee attachment located under the wing, cylinder bungee location straps for quick location of bungees and primary BCD inflation located at the bottom of the harness instead of the top. Widespread popularity of sidemount diving systems did not truly emerge until the mid-2010s, when the growing popularity of technical and cave diving became exposed to sidemount proponents on the internet who were offering an alternative approach that matched the minimalism and functionality of the popular 'DIR/Hogarthian' back-mounted systems, whilst offering advantages in flexibility, comfort, accessibility and – highly debated online – safety. The increasing interest in sidemount diving configurations prompted several manufacturers and individuals to design and sell their own designs of a sidemount system. Hollis, OMS, UTD developed equipment, while Steve Bogaerts (a UK-born cave pioneer, who lives and dives in Mexico) released the popular minimalist 'Razor' system and began teaching a specific model training program for his rig. At this time, several technical scuba agencies developed formal sidemount training programs and incorporated sidemount diving configuration as an equipment option within existing technical diving programs. When PADI instructor, Jeff Loflin, developed a sidemount diving speciality course, it proved extremely popular, and was replicated by many PADI technical-level instructors. This led to PADI offering standardised sidemount diving programs at both recreational and technical levels, making sidemount a viable and mainstream option for both recreational and technical divers. Other agencies, such as ANDI, IANTD, SSI, TDI, UTD and ISE (Innerspace Explorers) also provide sidemount training at varied levels.  Distinctive schools of design  = British / Mexico Cave = A typically minimalist and lightweight approach, generally used with aluminum cylinders. Most popular with warm-water/wetsuit and travelling divers. Most often seen in Mexican cave systems. This is the evolution from sidemount pioneers who initially used lightweight hydration bladders (i.e. MSR) for their buoyancy requirements, with a basic harness for cylinder and weight attachment. ;Harness: A 'hogarthian' inspired, bare webbing harness, using separate shoulder and lumbar plates. ;Lower cylinder attachment: D-rings on the rear waist-belt, ;Upper cylinder attachment: Continuous and loop bungees, ;Wing shape: Triangle, diamond or box bladders (lift focused over the hips, less up the torso) ;Example rigs: Apeks WSX, Razor 2.0, Scubarrow, XDeep Stealth, UTD Z-Trim, Aquamundo, Diamond, Hollis Katana ;Influential proponents: Steve Bogaerts, Steve Martin, Garry Dallas = American / Florida Cave = These are the robust 'big rigs', generally used with steel cylinders. Most popular with cold-water sidemount divers in the US and Europe. Most often seen in Florida cave systems. This is the evolution from sidemount pioneers who initially used home-converted BCDs/wing systems, typically in response to a higher buoyancy requirement from using steel cylinders/higher weighting needed for colder water exposure protection. ;Harness: Typically an in-built harness to the BCD, with quick-release buckles and adjustments. ;Lower cylinder attachment: Butt-plate with rails ;Upper cylinder attachment: 'Old-school', independent and ring bungees, ;Wing shape: Donut and horseshoe bladders (lift distributed evenly up the torso) ;Example rigs: Armadillo, DiveRite Nomad, Hollis SMS100, Hollis SMS75, Halcyon Contour ;Influential proponents: Lamar Hires, Woody Jasper, Mark Long, Wes Skiles, Edd Sorensen  Configurations  Various harness/BCD configurations have been used to sidemount cylinders. The choice between different configuration approaches is typically determined by the nature of the diving undertaken (open water, technical, wreck or cave) and by the divers' existing equipment, financial budget and whether they have a preferred diving philosophy (minimalist, DIR, Hogarthian, etc.). The size, material, and volume of diving cylinders to be used also has a large impact on sidemount BCD requirements. = Backplate and wing harness adaptation = Rigid Hogarthian style backplate and wing BCD systems may be modified by adding butt-plates, bungee cords and optional special sidemount buoyancy compensators. Cylinders are supported at the valve end by bungee loops that run from the backplate to the front chest D-rings. The lower cylinder clip attaches to D-rings mounted on the waist belt or 'rails' on a butt plate. Sidemount divers who conduct penetration diving in tight environments will generally prefer a flexible fabric backplate, or webbing harness only, which is considered less likely to get stuck in a small restriction than a rigid backplate. An example of a commercial backplate and wing harness adapter, including integrated butt plate and attachment points for bungee loops, is the OMS Profile. = Specialized and hybrid harnesses = Tech sidemount with two 12l steel cylinders for main gas supply and two aluminium 80s for decompression gas Specialized sidemount harnesses are available 'off-the-shelf' commercially. Some of these are designed specifically for sidemounting only, but others are 'hybrid' designs, enabling the diver to swap between sidemount and back-mounted cylinders, as needed. Examples of dedicated sidemount rigs: * Apeks WSX25 and WSX45 * Hollis SMS50 * Razor 2 * DiveRite Nomad LT * XDeep Stealth 2.0 * Golem Gear A2 and S * UTD 'Z-system' Examples of hybrid sidemount rigs: * Hollis SMS100 or SMS75 * OMS Tesseract * DiveRite Nomad XT or EXP * Custom Divers Rhino * White Arrow S-Wing Some manufacturers now provide sidemount rigs targeted for recreational diving use. These are typically variants of existing dedicated sidemount rigs, with the low pressure inflator (LPI) mounted at the top of the BCD (rather than at the bottom corner) for an 'over the shoulder' configuration more familiar to diver's transitioning to sidemount from a traditional BCD.

Cylinders are usually attached to a shoulder or chest D-ring and waist belt D-ring on each side. Additional accessories may include canister lights and clip-on pockets for small equipment. This style of harness may be off the shelf from an original equipment manufacturer or retailer, or home made, as most of the parts are freely available or relatively simple to make.  Belt style 'Sump' harness  In the UK, cave diving was an additional skill learned by cavers to explore flooded parts of a cave system, rather than divers choosing to explore caves. The early equipment was little more than cylinders fitted with belt loops and slid onto the standard caver's belay or battery belt along with any extra weights needed to achieve neutral buoyancy, and a caver's belt mounted battery pack. This simple sidemount configuration was particularly low profile and suited to small cylinders, and worked well for low visibility, usually fairly shallow dives, which were often more of a crawl or wriggle though tight confines than a swim. As penetration distances into caves increased, the basic belt was replaced by a more sturdy harness with shoulder straps and padding on the waist band to distribute the load more comfortably. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the cylinders and lead weights must be fitted to the harness before it is put on. This usually required the diver to lie down to fit the harness, and if the cylinders were large, to be assisted to a standing position.

Equipment  = Cylinders = Detail showing choker Sidemount cylinder set with regulators fitted ;Cylinder: Cylinders of varying sizes and materials can be used for sidemount diving. The optimum choice of cylinder will be determined by the water conditions and/or choice of exposure protection used. ;Regulator set: Each primary sidemount cylinder requires a regulator 1st stage, a regulator second stage and a submersible pressure gauge (SPG). The left hand cylinder will also include a low-pressure inflator (LPI) for BCD inflation. If a drysuit is used, the drysuit inflator will be attached to the right hand cylinder. The most common regulator configuration mimicks hogarthian regulator set-up, with a long (5–7 foot) hose on the right cylinder and a short hose on the left cylinder, where the regulator is contained in a bungee necklace. However, some sidemount divers prefer an opposite configuration, two long hoses or two short hoses. ;Cylinder straps: Sidemount cylinders are secured to the diver's butt-plate or rear harness D-rings via a cam-band or worm clamp to which a bolt snap is attached via cord. The placement of the cam-band/worm clamp along the cylinder length is determined by characteristics needed to ensure cylinder trim in line with the diver's torso. The upper cylinder may be secured directly via the bungee strap, or by using a choker into a ring-bungee configuration. ;Choker (#1): A simple loop of sturdy nylon cord (often 440 cord) secured around the cylinder neck. A double-ended bolt snap can be removed and replaced as required, or a single bolt snap can be permanently attached. The purpose is to provide additional cylinder security and stability when conducting water entries with the sidemount cylinders in place. It can also be used as an emergency attachment, should the bungee fail. ;Choker (#2): A small strap around the neck of a sidemount cylinder used to pull the bolt snap closer to the cylinder neck. Primarily used in conjunction with the DiveRite 'Ring Bungee' mounting method; this has the effect of constraining the top of the cylinder to lie closer to the shoulder of the diver for a lower profile. The choker is passed through the jaw of the snap and tightened, then the clip is clipped to the bungee which is clipped to the shoulder D-ring, allowing the clip to slide along the bungee. = Bungees = The use of bungees for upper cylinder attachment and trim is a quintessential identifier of sidemount configuration. The bungee is attached to the rear upper harness/BCD and routes under the diver's armpits to the front shoulder webbing. Appropriate length and thickness bungees are critical to ensure that the sidemount cylinders remain in trim horizontally along the diver's side torso with the valves under the armpits. The cylinder/s should neither rise above, or drop below, the diver when they are in flat, horizontal trim position. The cylinder is secured by wrapping, or routing, the bungees around the cylinder valve handle, stem and/or cylinder neck. In addition to providing the desired cylinder positioning and trim, the bungees also provide the capacity to secure the cylinder top end to the diver while the cylinders are detached at the bottom and maneuvered into a forward position. ;Double Independent Bungee: This method utilizes two lengths of bungee, typically attached to the rear of the harness/BCD via stainless steel quick-links. They may attach via dedicated D-rings on the diver's BCD or a 'daisy chain' length of looped nylon webbing that permits easy adjustment of bungee length/fit. ;Continuous Bungee: This is a single length of bungee cord, routed from one shoulder D-ring to the other, via the rear of the diver and under the armpits. It is also a popular method of 'back-up' or reserve bungee, that is carried in the diver's pouch and deployed in case the primary bungee fails during the dive. ;Old School Bungee: This method uses a double strand of bungee is secured at the rear through a strip of horizontal webbing. The bungees route under the arms and are secured to the shoulder D-rings via bolt snaps. ;Loop Bungee: An evolution of the old school bungee, the loop bungee is a double strand of bungee that is secured to the rear harness and runs under the armpits. It is secured to the shoulder harness via a fixed, smaller, loop of bungee tied through a triglide retainer. ;Floating Loop Bungee: (also known as the sliding loop bungee) This is a derivative of the basic loop bungee, except the smaller loop on the shoulder harness is free-floating. The attachment is typically just a small loop of bungee tied directly around the shoulder harness webbing. ;Ring Bungee: The 'Ring Bungee' introduces a metal ring along the bungee length (in the armpit area). This permits the use of a choker to connect tanks to the ring, making bungee wrapping of the cylinder valve/neck unnecessary. A popular configuration has the bolt snap connected to a ring by a quick link, with a length of bungee from the ring to another quick link which is used to connect the assembly to a D-ring on the back of the harness. The bolt snap is clipped to the shoulder D-ring and the cylinder neck bolt snap is clipped to the ring. The choker is used to minimise the distance the cylinder top can dangle away from the ring bungee. = Sidemount Buoyancy Bladders = Sidemount systems provide buoyancy through a wing-style bladder that is located behind the diver. These bladders are typically designed according to one of two concepts; ;Triangular, Diamond or Box Shaped Bladders: This design of bladder owes its heritage to the early use of MSR hydration bags converted for diving buoyancy. The concept maximizes buoyancy provision over the hip area, with little or no buoyancy held on the upper back. The bladder is normally attached at the top to the shoulder plate or spine webbing; and at the base to the waist-belt webbing. They are often 'wrap-around' in design and some use lengths of bungee for connection around the divers stomach area and through the crotch. Notable examples are the Razor 2.0, XDeep Stealth, Scubarrow and UTD Z-Trim. The Aquamundo sidemount wing - a triangle design bladder, with design heritage from the British / Mexican Cave school of sidemount ;Donut or Horseshoe Bladders: This design of bladder concept stems from sidemount pioneers who converted jacket-style or wing BCDs for use as homemade sidemount systems. The buoyancy provision runs along the entire back area. These bladders typically provide greater buoyancy capacity than the triangular style designs. Notable examples are the Armadillo, DiveRite Nomad and Hollis SMS100. = Sidemount Accessories = Most sidemount accessories will be appropriate to the diving environment and task, as is generally the case for scuba diving. None of the items listed below is unique to sidemount diving – they are generally penetration diving accessories used by sidemount divers because sidemount is commonly associated with tight penetration diving. ;Cutting devices: Sidemount divers, particularly those operating in overhead environments will carry two or more cutting devices. These should be stowed where they can be easily accessed, even when in a tight passage. Popular stowage locations include; a sheath mounted on the harness or lower arm. Redundant/back-up devices may be carried in a pocket. Short bladed knives, trauma shears or emergency line cutters are the most popular selections for primary and back-up cutting tools. ;Lights: Sidemount divers who enter overhead environments will typically carry a primary torch, often of umbilical/canister design, along with one or two back-up torches. Specific sidemount umbilical/canister torches are now sold, with a 90 degree junction for the umbilical which permits them to be mounted on the butt-plate or upper-rear crotch strap. Back-up torches are typically a robust LED design, with a battery/burn life indicated to be 2-3x that of the planned dive duration. ;Reels and spools: Sidemount divers will typically carry one or more reels/spools. In open-water these may be used for deployment of delayed surface marker buoys (DSMB). In overhead environments, these will include a primary guideline and safety/jump spools - in like with cave or technical wreck diving protocols. These are typically attached to the diver on rear D-rings, normally on the butt-plate or rear waist strap, to prevent them dangling below the diver. ;Line arrows and markers: Sidemount divers in overhead environments will carry a selection of directional (arrows) and non- directional (cookies) line markers. The use of Referencing Exit Markers (REM) is also becoming popular with sidemount divers. ;Helmet: Helmets are particularly popular with sidemount divers, as they provide a convenient mounting point for primary and/or back-up lights. The primary function of the helmet remains to provide head protection in overhead environments. Sidemount configuration can mean that the more typical method of mounting back-up lights below the diver's shoulder D-rings becomes less favorable. This area is more heavily loaded with bungee and deco stage attachments, reducing access to back-up lights stowed from the D-ring. Mounting primary lights on the helmet can be advantageous as it frees up the hands in very confined spaces and/or when heavily task-loaded with other equipment. The draw-backs to helmet mounted lights are that it can increase the risk of snagging the helmet on obstructions and an increased potential to inadvertently dazzling dive buddies. Sidemount divers may choose to make their own helmet by adapting an existing climbing, kayaking or skate-boarding helmet, or may purchase an off- the-shelf cave/sidemount diving helmet.

File:Sidemount helmet with bungee strap.jpgSidemount helmet with bungee strap File:Sidemount diver with sidemount helmet..jpgTechnical diver with sidemount helmet, pre-dive. ;Pocket: A pocket is useful for carrying small accessories and spares. A small nylon pouch which clips, via double-ended bolt snaps onto the rear D-rings has the advantages of streamlining, while permitting easy access to the contents by removing or replacing the pouch as necessary.  Training  There are three main levels of sidemount training: = Level 1 = \\"Recreational\\", \\"Rec\\", or \\"Basic\\" sidemount training is offered by most agencies, and aims to develop initial equipment familiarity and operation. At this level, students are taught to adjust, fit and operate the sidemount rig, whilst diving with one or two cylinders maximum. These training courses then develop core diving skills that are specifically relevant to sidemount equipment usage – namely: equipment set-up, diver and cylinder trim, buoyancy control, alternative propulsion techniques and cylinder handling in the water. Many basic courses also teach supplementary diving skills, such as DSMB deployment and variations on open water skills, such as inverted (upside-down) fining and inverted mask- clearing. Knowledge development covers topics such as: gas management, dive planning and equipment considerations/options. A recreational sidemount diver with 2 cylinders = Level 2 = \\"Technical\\" or \\"Tech\\" (sometimes called \\"advanced\\") sidemount courses develop higher level sidemount skills with a focus on technical decompression diving with 3 or more cylinders. A higher level of equipment proficiency and diving skill is required; as additional deco cylinders will be added to the rig, enabling mixed-gas and accelerated decompression procedures to be conducted. A technical sidemount diver as part of a mixed (backmount/sidemount) technical diving team These courses generally require the student to be already certified as a technical diver (when crossing over from a backmount tech qualification), or the student first learns tec sidemount as a prerequisite for completing further technical decompression training in sidemount configuration. = Level 3 = \\"Advanced\\", \\"Overhead\\" or \\"Cave/Wreck\\" sidemount is the highest level of sidemount training which develops skills specifically for demanding penetration dives in the overhead cave or wreck environment. These courses are focused on maximizing the benefits of sidemount for passage through restricted and confined areas; and also teach multiple stage (additional tanks of bottom gas) diving techniques. Access to courses at this level is typically reserved for fully qualified cave or technical wreck sidemount divers, who have significant experience and skill. An advanced sidemount diver conducting overhead penetration in a shipwreck, using multiple stages and passing tight restrictions.  Procedures  One of the advantages of the sidemount system is the easy access to cylinder valves, and the protected position they occupy in comparison with most back mount systems, where the valves are relatively vulnerable to bumping against an overhead and being \\"rolled off\\" (closed by rubbing against the overhead). The standard arrangement for sidemount is that all cylinders are independent, and each is provided with a single demand valve, an SPG, and on one or two, a low pressure inflator hose for buoyancy compensator and, if used, the drysuit. This implies that if gas is shared in an emergency, the recipient will be breathing from a different cylinder to the donor, unlike the more usual arrangement with backmount, where both divers breathe off the same set. In the case of recreational sidemount, with only one cylinder, the regulator would have an octopus demand valve for air sharing and the procedures would revert to much the same as for a single back mount cylinder. = Gas management = The sidemount diver typically operates two independent tanks for 'bottom gas' during a dive. Compared with back-mounted double cylinders and an isolation manifold, the use of independent cylinders requires additional gas management skills. The sidemount diver has to swap regulators at planned intervals to ensure that the use of gas is balanced from both cylinders - thus ensuring good balance and trim in the water, whilst preserving a sufficient supply of air for emergency sharing. As of 2013, the only sidemount system offering a manifold system is the UTD ‘Z-Manifold'. This equipment provides a link between cylinders and dispenses with the need to swap regulators and balance tanks. In all other instances, the sidemount diver will follow a gas management strategy, which enable roughly equal consumption of gas from both sidemount cylinders and retains a necessary minimum reserve in both cylinders to enable an air-sharing exit/ascent from the dive. The basic principle of breathing gas management is never to run out of suitable breathing gas while underwater. The implications depend on the team size and the dive profile, and range from very simple for a situation where the diver can make a safe free ascent at any point of the dive, to complex, when a team of two or three divers is constrained from surfacing immediately by decompression obligations or a hard overhead, and rely on each other for emergency gas supply at any point of the planned dive, particularly when a variety of gases are carried which are each only suitable for a specific depth range. It is standard practice to allow for the possibility of total failure of gas supply from any one cylinder at any point of the dive, and to turn the dive if the gas supply is compromised beyond the planned limits.  Rule of thirds and gas reserves  Most technical and overhead-environment divers will maintain the rule of thirds as the least conservative option when diving sidemount. Because air-sharing will remain a possibility while a second diver is present, it is considered good practice that both cylinders retain independent reserves of sufficient gas for both divers to reach the surface safely from any point in the planned dive. one third of the capacity of the cylinder is considered a simple rule of thumb reserve sufficient for most circumstances, but there are times when it is not enough and times when it will be more than enough. The principle of the rule of thirds is that one third of the gas supply is available for the penetration, one third for the return and one third is a reserve which allows for gas sharing on the return. Therefore, the dive is turned when either cylinder drops to two thirds of total capacity. It is not safe practice to drain one cylinder, retaining the entire reserve in the other, in case of a catastrophic failure of the second cylinder supply. Sidemount divers are trained to maintain a roughly equal balance of gas supply in each primary cylinder throughout the dive. This ensures that they always retain an equal reserve of gas for donation to an out-of-gas diver; and also helps preserves their stability and lateral trim by maintaining equal buoyancy characteristics in the tanks on either side of their body. ;Incremental Regulator Switching: This is the primary method taught to sidemount divers for balancing the gas in their cylinders. It involves switching between the left and right side regulators are pre- determined increments of pressure. The smaller the increment, the closer the match of pressure between primary cylinders. Typical increments might be 30bar (metric) or 500psi (imperial). ;Swapping after 1/6: A less used method of maintaining cylinder balance is to swap regulators for every 1/6 cylinder gas consumption. This would mean each regulator was breathed from twice, before reaching the gas turn-point (2/3) and a further two switches on each regulator until the reserve (1/3) was reached. ;Swapping after 1/3: The sidemount diver could also opt to switch regulators with every 1/3 gas consumed (on each cylinder). This would mean each regulator was used once, before reaching the gas turn-point (2/3) and once more, per regulator, before reaching reserve level (1/3). This method does not promote a fine cylinder buoyancy balance across the torso. Regular regulator switching also helps to confirm that both left and right-side regulators remain fully functional. Overhead environment divers find this an especially prudent measure when sidemount diving through restrictions in high silt and muddy conditions. = Skills = The following represents a summary of the skills taught by a sample of agencies at various sidemount diving levels: Level 1: \\"Recreational (Rec or Basic Sidemount)\\" * Equipment configuration and assembly * Pre-dive safety checks * Attaching tanks on land and at the surface (shallow and deep water) * Descent procedures * Trim and buoyancy * Propulsion techniques – frog kick, modified flutter kick, back kick, helicopter turn * Gas planning and management (independent cylinders) * Regulator switching * Air sharing - donor and receiver * Tank positioning and adjustment for continual good trim * Removal of single tank while swimming * Removal of two tanks while swimming * Inverted and/or vertical mask clearing * DSMB deployment ascent procedures Level 2: \\"Technical (Tec or Advanced Sidemount)\\" * Equipment configuration and assembly * Stage bottle configuration and assembly * Water entry procedures * Descent procedures * Trim and buoyancy * Propulsion techniques - frog kick, modified frog and flutter kick, back kick, helicopter turn, finger walking, pull and glide * Sidemount diving mobility – inverted propulsion, rolls, loops etc. * Gas planning and management, including decompression gasses * Team drills and development * Guideline/penetration contingency drills * Sidemount regulator shut-downs * Feather breathing from a shut-down free-flowing regulator (Manually operating the cylinder valve to supply air on demand from a cylinder with a malfunctioning demand valve). * Swapping regulators between cylinders underwater * In-water stage bottle attachment, removal and replacement * Sidemount decompression procedures * Practice of all sidemount skills (Level 1 & Level 2) within specific over-head environment (cave/wreck) = Compatibility in mixed configuration team diving = The basic sidemount configuration requires different techniques for sharing gas, compared to the isolation manifolded twins back mount configuration. This means that a single set of standardised safety procedures is not possible while diving with team members using back-mounted tanks. The UTD Z-system provides an approach to emulate back-mounted Hogarthian configuration by quick-connecting two primary gas supply sidemount cylinders to a manifold block mounted behind the shoulders on the Z-system harness, from which long hose primary and necklace secondary demand valves are supplied, reducing the demand valve arrangement to a functional approximation of the standard Hogarthian configuration at the expense of additional complexity of components. The added failure points may not be necessary when using more than one bottle at the time. Additional stage cylinders are side-mounted with independent regulators.

In 1998, the station was purchased by DMG Regional Radio, and aligned to a classic hits format used by sister stations 4HI Emerald, 4ZR Roma, 4LM Mount Isa, 4GC Charters Towers, 4MK FM Mackay, 4CA FM Cairns, 4AM Mareeba and 4TO FM Townsville. The station used the slogan \\"The Best Songs of All Time\\"; all local programming outside of breakfast was scrapped in favour of syndicated programming from the network's Townsville hub. This format remained the same until 2004 when DMG Regional Radio merged with RG Capital to become Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, and as a result there were some program changes. The overnight Gold Coast produced programs that had originally aired on 4RO such as The Nitemix, Nelly at Night (later to become Talking Back The Night), the Partymix and Sunday Night At The Groovies were all transferred over to 4CC, which enabled 4RO to begin taking talkback programs out of Sydney. However, due to conditions placed upon the takeover, Macquarie Southern Cross Media had to sell several stations to other parties. Many of them, including 4CC, was sold to Prime Media Group. In 2008, the station trialled a local afternoon show but was eventually replaced with the networked \\"Jonathan Coleman Experience\\". In April 2009, the station changed format to the active rock/classic rock hybrid format used by Zinc 96 on the Sunshine Coast. Branded as Zinc 927, the changes came in conjunction with similar changes up the east coast of Queensland for various other Prime stations. 4CA FM Cairns, Sea FM Townsville and 4MK FM Mackay were all rebranded to Zinc. 4CA and 4MK retained their callsigns by taking over the AM Easymix stations in Cairns and Mackay and becoming more talkback-focused similar to what 4RO in Rockhampton had already become. In August 2013 Grant Broadcasters acquired the station and Prime Media's other nine radio stations in Queensland. On 2 June 2014 the station dropped the Zinc branding and format, relaunching as \\"Your Station\\" 4CC, returning the familiar call sign. The station now broadcasts an adult contemporary format. On 14 January 2016 4CC changed format to a News Talk Music format to bring the station in line with its sister station 4RO, this also included a Slogan change to that of sister station 4RO \\"News Talk and The Music You Love\\". The change went live across all 4 of its Transmitters on the morning of Monday 18 January 2016 with some negative feedback from longtime listeners on both their Facebook page and also via their talk back hotline about the loss of music in favor of a talk-back format during the mornings. The morning presenter was replaced by Michael J Bailey and Afternoon Drive has been replaced with Al Doblo. Most content at this time is networked from 4RO excluding ADs and Station ID. On Monday 21 March 2016, after trialing a Talkback Format with negative feedback from listeners, 4CC returned to a Classic Hits Format and once again started using the two slogans \\"Your Station, 4CC\\" & \\"The Station You Know and Love Is Back, 4CC\\".

All Sea FM stations currently owned by Southern Cross Austereo except Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton / Gladstone, are part of the Hit Network after Southern Cross Media merged with Austereo.

Gold Coast Broadcasters later became known as RG Capital with financial backing provided by Australian Media Tycoon Reg Grundy. With the further purchase of existing radio stations and the launch of newly granted supplementary FM licences, RG Capital expanded the Sea FM brand name and logo throughout Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. In 2004, RG Capital sold their regional stations to Macquarie Regional RadioWorks (now Southern Cross Austereo). Following RG Capital's purchase by Macquarie Regional Radioworks, RG Capital's FM stations in Victoria were rebranded to Star FM. In 2013, the Grant Broadcasters owned and operated 99.7 Sea FM in Scottsdale, Tasmania dropped the Sea FM branding and relaunched as Chilli FM, bringing it in line with sister station 90.1 Chilli FM Launceston. Also in 2013, Southern Cross Austereo offloaded both Sea FM and Mix FM on the Sunshine Coast to EON Broadcasters who paid $17.7million for the stations in a forced sale following a technical breach which occurred in 2011, when the Austereo and Southern Cross networks merged. The merger resulted in the same company owning too many radio assets in a region where two markets (Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast) overlapped, prompting the Australian Communications and Media Authority to force the company to sell two of its assets.Glenn Wheatley buys Sea FM & Mix FM, radioinfo, 7 March 2013.

It operates on 120 miles of former Union Pacific branch lines, and is a subsidiary of the Rio Grande Pacific Corp., based in Fort Worth, Texas. Idaho Northern and Pacific's offices are in Emmett, Idaho. As of 2019, the INPR operated two separate sections of track, one running from La Grande to Elgin, Oregon, connecting at Elgin with another former UP rail line now owned by Wallowa County – which continues to Joseph, Oregon – and the other running from Payette through Emmett and then into the canyon of the North Fork of the Payette River northward to Cascade. This section, considered the most scenic stretch of the INPR, previously continued to the former logging community of McCall, now a lakeside resort town, but that stretch has been abandoned. Both the Oregon portion and the Payette River line originally were built as logging lines serving lumber mills, but in the last two decades of the 20th century, many of the mills were shuttered due to a decline in logging and lumber processing in much of the Pacific Northwest. As of 2012, the Idaho Northern and Pacific still served Boise Cascade mills in Elgin, Island City, and La Grande, Oregon. INPR formerly operated an ex-UP spur connecting Boise with the Union Pacific main line at Nampa. However, the Boise Valley Railroad took over operation in 2009, possibly as a result of the post-housing boom recession. INPR also formerly operated the 85-mile Weiser, Idaho to Rubicon line from 1993 till its abandonment in 1995. From 1998 until 2015, the INPR operated the Thunder Mountain Line, a tourist railroad between Horseshoe Bend and Cascade. The Thunder Mountain Line offered scenic tours, dinner trains and \\"river and rail\\" trips along the Payette River that allowed people to ride a train north and return southward by river raft on the Payette. In 2014 the railroad started the brief Payette River flyer operation using 2 Budd RDC cars purchased from the Wallowa Union Railroad in Oregon; this operation ceased in 2016 as well.

He studied at the English college in Rheims, France, and was amongst the first students to go to St Alban's seminary in Valladolid, Spain, where he was ordained in 1597. He desired to enter the Society of Jesus, but it was considered prudent that he first gain some experience on the mission. He headed for Calais, France, on a ship which was pursued by Dutch ships. Rather than permitting themselves to be taken captive, many passengers jumped ship and successfully made it to shore. Fr Filcock however, was captured but managed to escape and landed on the Kent shore of England in early 1598 where he assumed the alias of Arthur and began his priestly ministry.\\"Blessed Roger Filcock, SJ\\", The Jesuits (Singapore) He was admitted as a Jesuit novice by Father Henry Garnet in 1600. While waiting to go to Flanders for his novitiate, Fr Filcock was apprehended, betrayed by a former fellow student at Valladolid and sent to Newgate prison in London. In 1601, Fr Filcock was charged for being a priest but he would neither admit nor deny, insisting that witnesses and evidence be brought forth. As none was forthcoming, he was brought for trial and heard the indictment against him. He requested to be tried without jury because he did not want the verdict, which he knew would be against him to be on the jurors’ consciences. Nevertheless, the judge directed the jury to find the defendant guilty and Fr Filcock was sentenced to the gallows for high treason. During his time as a missioner he had known Anne Line, a convert to the Catholic faith and widow whose husband had died in exile after being caught attending Mass. She had managed a variety of safe-houses for priests and lay faithful. Filcock had also been Line's confessor. On Candlemas Day, 1601, Father Francis Page was about to celebrate Mass in her lodgings when priest-catchers broke in. The priest escaped in the confusion but his hostess was arrested and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 26 February 1601, indicted for harbouring a priest. She was condemned and led to the gallows the next day. She was executed at the same occasion as Dom Mark Barkworth, a Benedictine monk, and Filcock, who had gone on trial on 23 February. This was the first execution of Catholics at Tyburn since 1595.

Predominate shipments include a variety of food products, oils, grains petroleum products, chemicals and steel products. Rio Grande Pacific Corporation maintains a 100% equity interest in this property. It is a subsidiary of the Rio Grande Pacific Company. The Westwego-Algiers line was received from Union Pacific, but is actually an amalgamation of portions of two parallel lines constructed by Union Pacific predecessors and rivals. The line closer to the river was a Texas & Pacific route, built along the river to service the industry-rich areas between Waggaman and Algiers. The T&P; was absorbed by the Missouri Pacific in 1976, which in turn was absorbed by the Union Pacific beginning in 1980, completed in 1997. Running parallel to the T&P; between the same communities was another route originally built by Morgan's Louisiana & Texas Railroad, which would later become the Texas & New Orleans Railroad, a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific system. When the SP was merged into the Union Pacific, this line, too, came under the control of the UP. The Gouldsboro-Myrtle Grove line was purchased from previous shortline New Orleans Lower Coast Railroad, which was a RailTex subsidiary. The NOLR purchased the 24 mile segment from the Union Pacific in 1991. The route had been a Missouri Pacific branchline before the UP merger, but was built in 1891 by the New Orleans, Fort Jackson & Grande Isle Railroad. In 1911, this company was combined with the New Orleans Southern Railway to form the New Orleans, Southern & Grand Isle Railway, which by 1916 was sold to form the New Orleans & Lower Coast Railroad.

At the time, Heinemann's only comment on the controversy was that the check for $10,000 was already cashed and the Louise Nevelson sculpture was not likely to be returned. Paco's Story relates the postwar experiences of its protagonist, haunted by the ghosts of his dead comrades who provide the novel's distinctive narrative voice. (Ghost stories are common in both American and Vietnamese literature about the war.) The story deals with the seemingly contradictory and morally ambiguous role of the soldier as both victimizer and victim. The Women's Publishing House, Nha Xuat Phu Nu of Hanoi, published Paco's Story in December 2010, translated by Pham Anh Tuan, with an introduction by celebrated Vietnamese novelist Bao Ninh. It is the first American-written war novel published in Vietnam. His third novel, Cooler by the Lake (1992), is a comic story about Chicago. A petty thief gets into awful trouble when he attempts to return to its owner a wallet with eight $100 bills in it. Thematically lighter than his first novels, it was less positively received. Heinemann's military experiences are documented in his book, Black Virgin Mountain (2005), a memoir. It chronicles his several returns to Vietnam and his personal and political views concerning the country and the war. He often referred to his two war novels and the memoir as an accidental trilogy.

In 1903, it was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries, which operated until 1940. In 1940, the Bureau of Fisheries became part of the newly created Fish and Wildlife Service, under the United States Department of the Interior. Organizational history =1871–1940= Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, a Democratic congressmen from New Yorks 4th Congressional District, originated the bill to create the U.S. Fish Commission in the United States House of Representatives. It was established by a joint resolution (16 Stat. 593) of the United States Congress on February 9, 1871, as an independent commission with a mandate to investigate the causes for the decrease of commercial fish and other aquatic animals in the coastal and inland waters of the United States, to recommend remedies to the U.S. Congress and the states, and to oversee restoration efforts. The Commission was organized into three divisions: the Division of Inquiry respecting Food-Fishes and Fishing Grounds, the Division of Fisheries, and the Division of Fish- Culture. The Commission was led first by Spencer F. Baird, then Marshall McDonald, George Brown Goode, and finally George Bowers. By an Act of Congress of February 14, 1903, the U.S. Fish Commission became part of the newly created United States Department of Commerce and Labor and was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries, with both the transfer and the name change effective on July 1, 1903. In 1913, the Department of Commerce and Labor was divided into the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Department of Labor, and the Bureau of Fisheries became part of the new Department of Commerce. In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the United States Department of the Interior, and on June 30, 1940, it was merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service, an element of the Interior Department. =Successor organizations= In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service was reorganized as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and divided its operations into two bureaus, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, with the latter inheriting the history and heritage of the old U.S. Fish Commission and U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Upon the formation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce on October 3, 1970, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries merged with the saltwater laboratories of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife to form today's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an element of NOAA, and the former Bureau of Commercial Fisheries research ships were resubordinated to the NMFS. During the 1972 and 1973, these ships were integrated with those of other parts of NOAA to form the unified NOAA fleet. The NMFS is considered the modern-day successor to the U.S. Fish Commission and U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and the NOAA fleet of today also traces its history in part to them.

Work =Research and publications= The U.S. Fish Commission carried out extensive investigations of the fishes, shellfish, marine mammals, and other life in the rivers, lakes, and marine waters of the United States and its territories; corresponded widely with marine researchers around the world; scrutinized fishing technologies; designed, built, and operated hatcheries for a wide variety of finfish and shellfish; and oversaw the fur seal \\"fishery\\" in the Territory of Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands. The Commission's research stations and surveys collected significant data on U.S. fish and fishing grounds, with considerable material going to the Smithsonian Institution. Four ships were built for the Commission, including the schooner-rigged steamer USFC Fish Hawk, which served as a floating fish hatchery and fisheries research ship from 1880 to 1926; the brigantine-rigged steamer USFC Albatross, which operated as a fisheries research ship from 1882 to 1921 except for brief periods of United States Navy service in 1898 and from 1917 to 1919; and the sailing schooner USFC Grampus, which was commissioned in 1886 and operated as a fisheries research ship until 1917. The Edenton Station hatchery was established in 1899. From 1871 to 1903, the Commission's Annual Report to Congress detailed its efforts and findings in all of these areas. From 1881 to 1903, the Commission also published an annual Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission summarizing the commission's Annual Report to Congress and correspondence; the bulletins included detailed catch reports from fishermen and commercial fishing port agents around the United States and Canada, reports and letters from naturalists and fish researchers around the United States and in other countries, and descriptions of the Commission's exploratory cruises and fish hatchery efforts. Beginning in 1884, the Commission published the seminal work The Fisheries and Fisheries Industries of the United States. =Fishery enforcement= After the United States purchased Russian America from the Russian Empire in 1867 and created the Territory of Alaska, enforcement of whatever regulations to protect fisheries and marine mammals that existed in Alaska fell to the revenue cutters of the United States Revenue-Marine, which in 1894 became the United States Revenue Cutter Service and was one of the ancestor organizations of the United States Coast Guard.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Early Fisheries Enforcement Patrol Boats (1912-39) On 14 June 1906, however, the United States Congress passed the Alien Fisheries Act to protect and regulate fisheries in the Alaska Territory by placing restrictions on the use of fishing tackle and on cannery operations in the territory and authorizing the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to enforce the regulations. The Bureau established regional districts throughout Alaska to organize fishery and marine mammal protection patrols but had no vessels suitable for fishery patrols in Alaska, and during the next few years relied on vessels borrowed from other United States Government agencies (such as the Revenue Cutter Service), on chartered vessels, and on transportation that canneries offered for free to Bureau of Fisheries agents. This approach was not satisfactory for various reasons, such as the requirement for vessels of other government agencies to perform non-fishery-related functions, ethical concerns over accepting transportation from the canneries the Bureau of Fisheries agents were supposed to regulate, and the difficulty of enforcing regulations when the local fishing and canning industry personnel warned one another of the approach of Bureau of Fisheries agents who had accepted transportation on cannery vessels. Each year after the 1906 passage of the Alien Fisheries Act, the Bureau of Fisheries requested more personnel and vessels with which to fulfill its regulatory and law enforcement responsibilities. By 1911, when the Alaska fishing industry reached an annual value of nearly US$17 million, it had become clear that the United States Government needed to make radical changes in how it enforced the provisions of the Alien Fisheries Act, including funding the acquisition of a fleet of dedicated fishery patrol vessels under the Bureau of Fisheries. In 1912, the Bureau purchased the former cannery tender SS Wigwam to serve as its first fishery patrol vessel; renamed USFS OspreyNOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Osprey, BOF's first Alaska patrol boat – beginning a custom of naming the boats after birds common in Alaska – she was commissioned in 1913 and quickly added the protection of fur seal and sea otter populations to her responsibilities.

The Bureau also chartered vessels to support Alaska fisheries protection, and Bureau patrol boats regularly protected migrating fur seal herds along the coast of Washington and Alaska. On 25 October 1928, several Bureau of Fisheries vessels were tasked to join U.S. Navy vessels in enforcing the provisions of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1924 in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean, with their crews granted all powers of search and seizure in accordance with the act to protect populations of Pacific halibut. By 1930 the Bureau had nearly 20 boats patrolling in Alaskan waters. In 1933, it began to add speedboats to its Alaskan patrol inventory. In 1918, the Bureau of Fisheries augmented its fishery enforcement effort with a force of \\"steam watchmen,\\" temporary employees who worked two to five months a year and kept a particular area under continuous observation; they also occasionally maintained lights and protected free-floating fish traps from drift.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Stream Watchmen The stream watchmen sometimes provided their own motorboats. From an initial force of 10 men in 1918, the stream watchman force – which operated in both Southeast and Southcentral Alaska – grew to 59 men in 1922 and 220 in 1931. In addition to stream watchmen, the Bureau also employed special wardens and operators of chartered boats to enforce fishery regulations. The Bureau of Fisheries also began to use aircraft for fishery patrols in 1929, chartering a seaplane from Alaska-Washington Airways to experiment with aerial patrol over Alaskan waters.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Aircraft for Enforcement, Surveying & Transportation The aerial patrols were successful, and regular aerial patrols by Bureau of Fisheries agents using chartered aircraft began in 1930. The patrols focused on Southeast Alaska, and by 1939 logged an annual total of in 64 hours of flying. The fishery enforcement vessels and aircraft also provided transportation to Bureau of Fisheries personnel and assisted in the Bureau's scientific activities in Alaska. In 1940, the Fish and Wildlife Service took over the fleet of patrol boats and the aerial patrol mission, and continued fishery enforcement operations, including the use of stream watchmen, wardens, and chartered boat operators, until Alaska became a state in 1959 and began to assume the responsibility for fishery protection in its waters. By around 1960, the Fish and Wildlife Service had transferred many of its patrol boats to the State of Alaska and refocused its resources on its scientific mission. =Pribilof tenders= On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands, to the Bureau of Fisheries. Initially the Bureau chartered commercial vessels to transport passengers and cargo to, from,and between the Pribilofs, but by 1915 it had decided that a more cost-effective means of serving the islands would be to own and operate its own \\"Pribilof tender,\\" a dedicated cargo liner responsible for transportation to, from, and between the islands.

Fleet The U.S. Fish Commission operated five ships, and they used the prefix \\"USFC\\" while in commission. The Bureau of Fisheries inherited all five USFC ships, and its fleet expanded during the early 20th century. Its ships were given the prefix \\"USFS\\" while in commission, derived from an alternative name, \\"United States Fisheries Service,\\" sometimes used for the Bureau. Although there were occasional exceptions (such as , , and Roosevelt), the Fish Commission and Bureau of Fisheries custom was to name vessels after aquatic birds. The later organizational history of the fleet paralleled that of the history of the Bureau's successor organizations. In 1940, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) took over the Bureau of Fisheries fleet, and when the FWS was reorganized as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1956, its seagoing ships were assigned to the USFWS's new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF), which inherited the history and heritage of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Fisheries. When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was created in 1970, its National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was considered the successor to the BCF, and the NMFS took control of what had been the BCF's fleet. NMFS-controlled ships then were united with ships of other agencies to form a unified NOAA fleet during 1972–1973. The Fish Commission and Bureau of Fisheries fleets therefore are among the ancestors of today's NOAA fleet.

The change may be phonetic only, such as pronouncing Mississippi as Missippi in English, or acceptance of a new word structure, such as the transformation from calidus in Latin to caldo (hot) in Italian. Orthographic metaplasms have been used in philosophy to advance humanity's conceptual terrain, such as when Derrida adapted Heidegger's Destruktion into deconstruction or the French term différence into différance. Changes at either level may or may not be recognized in standard spelling, depending on the orthographic traditions of the language in question. Originally the term referred to techniques used in Ancient Greek and Latin poetry, or processes in those languages' grammar. Sound change Many phonological changes found frequently in the natural development of languages are metaplasms: * Epenthesis, addition of a sound to a word: ** beginning of a word (prothesis) ** end (paragoge) * Synalepha, two syllables becoming one, occurs by elision, crasis, synaeresis, or synizesis. ** Elision (\\"contraction\\" in English grammar), removal of a sound: ***beginning of a word (apheresis) *** middle (syncope) *** end (apocope). ** Crasis (Ancient Greek contraction), coalescence of two vowels into a new long vowel. ** Synaeresis, pronunciation of two vowels as a diphthong.

Its name is Spanish for \\"the pass\\", referring to a small gap in the hills on the community's northern edge. Once known as Peach Orchard Gap in its early settlement, the origin of El Paso's Spanish name is unknown. History The historic Southwest Trail, a path used by most travelers entering Arkansas early in the 1800s, entered El Paso on today's Arkansas Highway 5 from Floyd, then headed to Gibson via Arkansas Highway 89, Tate's Mill Road and Batesville Pike Road. By the 1830s more than 80 percent of the Arkansas territory's population had entered through the Southwest Trail. The route is also known as the Old Military Road. Geography The center of El Paso is located at 35.13, -92.10. Much of the community is situated along Bull Creek, and along Arkansas State Highway 5 and U.S. Highway 64. Lacking exact boundaries, the community is located within the borders of El Paso Township, within White County. The closest city is Vilonia, approximately seven miles to the west of El Paso via U.S. 64. Beebe, where El Paso's children attend public schools, is about 13 miles to the east along this highway. Along Arkansas 5, Cabot is 15 miles to the south, and the unincorporated community of Romance is eight miles north. Economy Vendors of tornado shelters, answering service and small gift items are among the cluster of businesses found at the intersection of the two major highways in El Paso. Many commuters typically pass through the small community, prompting the construction of, among other things, Sawbucks, a very popular family eating establishment, and a McDonald's restaurant since the late 1990s. El Paso also is the home of Rafter R Logistics, LLC and R & R Transportation Solutions, LLC.Most notably is the new CrossRoads Cowboy Church and 2 bar 2 Arena.

In these works, the ring makes the wearer invisible. A magic ring is a fictional piece of jewelry, usually a finger ring, that is purported to have supernatural properties or powers. It appears frequently in fantasy and fairy tales. Magic rings are found in the folklore of every country where rings are worn.Josepha Sherman, Once upon a Galaxy p 129 Some magic rings can endow the wearer with a variety of abilities including invisibility and immortality. Others can grant wishes or spells such as neverending love and happiness. Sometimes, magic rings can be cursed, as in the mythical ring that was recovered by Sigurd from the hoard of the dragon Fafnir in Norse mythologyByock, Jesse L, 1990, reprinted 1999. The Saga of the Volsungs: the Norse Epic of Sugurd the Dragon Slayer. Translated from Old Norse with an introduction. Penguin Books Limited. or the fictional ring that features in The Lord of the Rings. More often, however, they are featured as forces for good, or as a neutral tool whose value is dependent upon the wearer. A finger ring is a convenient choice for a magic item: it is ornamental, distinctive and often unique, a commonly worn item, of a shape that is often endowed with mystical properties (circular), can carry an enchanted stone, and is usually worn on a finger, which can be easily pointed at a target.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Rings\\", p 813  History  A Queen takes a magic ring from a fish's mouth. Early stories of magical rings date to classical antiquity. Plato, in the second book of The Republic, tells a story about the Ring of Gyges, which conferred invisibility on its wearer.Grube, G M A and Reeve, rev C D C. 1997. Republic: Book II. In: Cooper, John M (Ed). Plato: Complete Works. Hackett Publishing Company. p 1000. The shepherd Gyges, who found it in a cave, used its power to seduce the queen, kill the king and take his place. Earlier accounts of Gyges, however, who was king of Lydia, make no mention of a magic ring. Magic powers are not generally attributed to rings in ancient Greek legend, although many other magical objects are listed, particularly in the Perseus myth. Josephus (8.2) repeats an anecdote of one Eleazar who used a magic ring to exorcise demons in the presence of Vespasian. J G Frazer, in his study of magic and superstition in The Golden Bough, has speculated to the effect that rings can serve, in the \\"primitive mind\\", as devices to prevent the soul from leaving the body and to prevent demons from gaining entry.Frazer, James, 1922. The Golden Bough. Published by Penguin Books Limited with an introduction by George Stocking Jr., 1996 (Frazer's abridged version). A magic ring, therefore, might confer immortality by preventing the soul's departure and thwart the penetration of any harmful magic that might be directed against the wearer. These magical properties inhibiting egress of the soul may explain \\"an ancient Greek maxim, attributed to [the ancient philosopher and mystic] Pythagoras, which forbade people to wear rings\\".Frazer, James, 1922. The Golden Bough. Published by Penguin Books Limited with an introduction by George Stocking Jr., 1996 (Frazer's abridged version). p 293. =Medieval demonology and alchemy= Traditional medieval Arabic and Hebraic demonology both cultivated the legend of the Ring of Solomon, used to control demons and / or djinn. For example, magic rings in Persian folktales feature in Arabian Nights, where Judar bin Omar, a fisherman finds the ring of Al-Shamardal, the enchanter and Ma'aruf, the cobbler discovers Shaddád ibn Aad's signet. The powers of both magic rings come from the servant djinn who are magically confined in them. In the story of Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, Aladdin also summons a second djinn from a finger ring given to him by the Maghrabi Magician. By the Renaissance era Solomon's ring had been adopted into Occidental magic, occultism, and alchemy. Magic rings are known in medieval Jewish esoteric tradition; they are mentioned in the Talmud and Midrash. Solomon's magical ring had many properties in legend: making him all-knowing, conferring him with the ability to speak with animals, and bearing the special sigil that sealed genies into bottles. A story about King Solomon and a ring is found in the Babylonian Talmud, but rings are more fully discussed in Jewish mystical literature. The power of a ring is in the divine name with which it is inscribed; such rings are used to invoke and command various guardians of heavenly palaces and to gain entrance to those heavens. In the Zohar, God is thought to own and use a signet ring, or, at least, a signet.Zohar 1:29a, although this is certainly metaphorical. =Norse mythology= \\"Brynhild, Sigurd and the Rings\\" Faroe stamp depicting magical rings from Norse mythologyA small number of Viking Age finger rings bearing runic inscriptions of apparently magical significance are known, among them the Kingmoor Ring and the Bramham Moor Ring. Rings endowed with special properties were significant in pagan Scandinavia. A 10th-century pagan Icelandic chieftain had a temple in which an arm ring rested upon an \\"altar\\", and upon which all oaths in the district were to be sworn, according to the 13th-century Eyrbyggja Saga.\\"The Saga Library, Vol II: The Story of the Ere- Dwellers, translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Bernard Quaritch, London, 1892) Eyrbyggja Saga Medieval and Classical Literature Library. An early magical ring in European mythology is the arm ring named Draupnir worn by the god Odin. Because its only reported function was to create more gold arm bands every nine days, Draupnir may have been a religious symbol which represented the increasing of wealth. The ring was placed onto Baldr's funeral pyre, but Baldr gave Draupnir back to Hermodr and so the ring was returned to Odin from the land of death.Byock, Jesse L, 2005. Snorri Sturluson: The Prose Edda. Norse Mythology, translated from Old Norse with an introduction. Penguin Books Limited. p 49. The Death of Baldr and Hermod's ride to Hel. pp 65–69. Another Norse ring was called Andvarinaut, the famous Ring of the Niebelung from a medieval Icelandic retelling from ancient poetry of the Saga of the Volsungs and The Nibelungenlied, which eventually becomes the property of the hero Siegfried or Sigurd. How it came to be cursed is explained in detail in The Volsunga Saga,Byock, Jesse L, 1990, reprinted 1999. The Saga of the Volsungs: the Norse Epic of Sugurd the Dragon Slayer. Translated from Old Norse with an introduction. Penguin Books Limited. p 14. The Otter's Ransom, pp 57–59. Andvarinaut's use is never specifically given in the story: its curse is simply a source of disaster for every person who owns it; its principal characteristic is that nearly everyone wants to get it, except Sigurd, who has got it, but does not know what it is. It is a gold ring that the dwarf Andvari cursed; later, Odin and Loki stole it.Byock, Jesse L, 1990, reprinted 1999. The Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sugurd the Dragon Slayer. Translated from Old Norse with an introduction. Penguin Books Limited. This ring was later recovered by Sigurd from the dragon Fafnir and he inherited its curse, in a sequence of events that involves Sigurd changing shapes with his brother-in-law Gunnar.Byock, Jesse L, 1990, reprinted 1999.

This finger ring can be worn with the stone on the inside, facing the palm, and then it will make the wearer invisible. The 14th century Middle English Arthurian romance Sir Perceval of Galles has the hero, Perceval, take a ring from the finger of a sleeping maiden in exchange for his own, and he then goes off on a series of adventures that includes defeating an entire Saracen army in a Land of Maidens. Only near the end of this romance does he learn that the ring he was wearing is a magic ring and that its wearer cannot be killed. Similar rings feature in the 14th century medieval romance Sir Eglamour of Artois and the 12th century Floris and Blancheflour, and in Thomas Malory's Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney, in his 15th century epic Le Morte d'Arthur, in which Gareth is given a ring by a damsel who lives in Avalon that will render him invulnerable to losing any blood at a tournament. In the medieval collection of Welsh tales called the Mabinogion, one of the romances – Geraint ab Erbin – has the eponymous character find a ring that grants him the powers of invisibility when worn. The Scottish ballads Hind Horn and Bonny Bee Hom both include a magic ring that turns pale when the person who received it has lost the person who gave it. Modern fiction Magic rings occur in a myriad of modern fantasy stories as incidental objects, but many novels feature a ring as a central part of the plot. Like other magical objects in stories, magic rings can act as a plot device, but in two distinct ways. They may give magical abilities to a person who is otherwise lacking in them, or enhance the power of a wizard. Or alternatively, they may function as nothing more than MacGuffins, that is, objects for which it is the characters' desire to obtain them, rather than any innate power that they possess, that moves the story along. J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, for example, involves a magical ring which allows Bilbo Baggins to be instrumental in a quest, matching the abilities of the dwarves. In the Volsunga Saga, on the other hand, the magic ring that Sigurd takes from the dragon Fafnir is a symbolic item, cursed by the dwarf Andvari from whom it was stolen by Loki; the ring is a plot device that creates a sense of inevitable disaster as the story unfolds. =The Ring of the Nibelung= Götterdämmerung tells the Rhinemaidens: \\"If you threaten my life, hardly you'll win from my hand the ring\\". The composer Richard Wagner wrote a series of four operas titled Der Ring des Nibelungen which present his version of the story told in The Nibelungenlied and in Volsunga Saga, as well as the Prose Edda. The operas are more often called The Wagner Ring Cycle in English. In this cycle, the ring of the Nibelung ultimately brings about the downfall of the old gods as Brünnhilde returns the ring, which confers power, back to the Rhinemaidens from whom its gold was stolen in the first place.von Westerman, Gerhart.1964, reprinted 1973. Opera Guide. Richard Wagner. pp 200–253. =The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings= J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel The Hobbit was written as children's fiction, but as the story grew into The Lord of the Rings the matter expanded, borrowing from Germanic and Norse mythology for many of its themes, creatures, and names. Of twenty magical Rings of Power, four are described in some detail: The extremely powerful and dangerous \\"One Ring\\" around which the plot revolves; and three rings worn by Gandalf the wizard and the elves Elrond and Galadriel. Seven Rings of Power were given to the dwarves in an only slightly successful attempt to corrupt them. Humans prove to be more susceptible; each of the nine Nazgûl were once great lords of men who were turned to terrifying wraiths and servants of the Dark Lord Sauron by their respective rings. The sixteen rings ultimately given to dwarves and men were created in a joint effort by the elves and Sauron. The three rings kept by the elves were forged by the elves alone, and Sauron had no direct hand in their creation. Sauron forged the One Ring in secret, with the intention that it would be a \\"master ring\\" and give him control over all the other rings, but was not completely successful in this aim. Only the One Ring makes any appearance in The Hobbit, and then it is only known as a magic ring which makes the wearer invisible; its much larger and darker significance is not revealed until The Lord of the Rings. The history of the Rings of Power is described in its known entirety in The Silmarillion, in \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\". =The Rose and the Ring= William Makepeace Thackeray's satirical novel The Rose and the Ring features a ring that has the power to make whoever owns it beautiful; its passage from person to person in the novel is an important element of the story. =The Chronicles of Narnia= In The Magician's Nephew, from C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia series, two magic rings, which take people to the Wood between the Worlds, a linking room between parallel universes, are central to the story; a yellow ring, when touched, sends a person to the Wood Between the Worlds, while a green ring is used from there to bring that person into a world of their choosing. These rings were created by the magician \\"Uncle Andrew\\" by the use of magical dust from Atlantis. =Harry Potter series= The Harry Potter series, by author J. K. Rowling, features a magic ring bearing a coat of arms linked to the Peverell brothers, Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's ancestors. It becomes one of the most important objects in Harry Potter's world because it contains a fragment of Voldemort's soul and formerly held one of the three Deathly Hallows: the Resurrection Stone which can summon the deceased. =Doctor Who first series= In the longest-running science-fiction series Doctor Who, the First Doctor sometimes used a ring with strange powers, which first appeared in The Web Planet where he used it to control a Zarbi. In Doctor Whos 20th anniversary story The Five Doctors the ring of Rassilon, the legendary founder of Time Lord society, is said to confer immortality. Apparently this is how Rassilon has remained alive. However, when the renegade Time Lord Borusa puts the ring on he is turned to stone, as were others before him. This was a trap by Rassilon for renegade Time Lords. =Others= * In Andre Norton's novel The Zero Stone, the title comes from a ring that has advanced properties. * H.

When the actress playing the main character left the show the ring was passed on to the new main character. * Solomon's ring appears in the stories featuring the comic book character Seraph. * In the DC Universe, the members of the Green Lantern Corps wear power rings that have a scientific, not magical, basis. These rings allow the bearer to perform any feat he can imagine, but are limited by his willpower. The Blackest Night story line reveals the existence of similar rings of other colors, powered by other emotions such as greed and hope. The original Green Lantern, Alan Scott fashions a power ring from an ancient lamp that is a concentration of magic energy that the Guardians of the Universe created in an attempt to remove magic from the universe. As a result of this discovery, Scott's ring functions much like the standard Green Lantern rings, except that it cannot directly affect wood. * In the Marvel Universe, Iron Man's nemesis The Mandarin has ten magical rings retrieved from an ancient alien spacecraft.

In wrestling, a bear hug, also known as a bodylock, is a grappling clinch hold and stand-up grappling position where the arms are wrapped around the opponent, either around the opponent's chest, midsection, or thighs, sometimes with one or both of the opponent's arms pinned to the opponent's body. The hands are locked around the opponent and the opponent is held tightly to the chest. The bear hug is a dominant position, with great control over the opponent, and also allows an easy takedown to the back mount position. A variation of the bear hug is the inverted bear hug, where one wrestler has his hands locked behind his opponent's mid or lower back and presses his forehead into their sternum, while pulling his locked hands inwards towards himself; forcing his opponent to bend backwards and fall. It is a painful move as much pressure is being exerted onto the opponent's sternum, often hurting the back bones and muscles as well as forcing air out of the lungs. In professional wrestling, this move is most often used by wrestlers known for great upper body strength. The move was used by Terrible Ted, an actual 600-pound bear which took part in wrestling exhibition matches in the USA and Canada between 1950 and 1975.

A \\"bear hug\\" is also known as an \\"icebreaker game\\" in which an odd number of people are divided into pairs, leaving one member without a partner. All players sit down in a large circle, one partner in front of the other. The player without a partner calls 2–5 names, depending upon the size of the group, of players sitting in the front. Those players then try to make their way to the player without a partner, while their partners attempt to hold them back. The match ends when a player reaches the individual who called the names. Players who were called and failed to reach the caller switch places with their partner so they are now in the back. The game often involves injuries due to the violent struggles between partners.

Vestibular system  The vestibular system, which is responsible for the sense of balance in humans, consists of the otolith organs and the semicircular canals. Illusions in aviation are caused when the brain cannot reconcile inputs from the vestibular system and visual system. The three semicircular canals, which recognize accelerations in pitch, yaw, and roll, are stimulated by angular accelerations; while the otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, are stimulated by linear accelerations. Stimulation of the semicircular canals occurs when the movement of the endolymph inside the canals causes movement of the crista ampullaris and the hair cells within them. Stimulation of the otolith organs occurs when gravitational forces or linear accelerations cause movement of the otolith membrane, the otoliths, or the hair cells of the macula. Somatogyral illusions occur as a result of angular accelerations stimulating the semicircular canals. Somatogravic illusions, on the other hand, occur as a result of linear accelerations stimulating the otolith organs.  Vestibular/somatogyral  Illusions involving the semicircular and somatogyral canals of the vestibular system of the ear occur primarily under conditions of unreliable or unavailable external visual references and result in false sensations of rotation.

The reason a pilot can be unaware of such an attitude change in the first place is that human exposure to a rotational acceleration of ~1 degrees per second²https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690013275.pdf or lower is below the detection threshold of the semicircular canals. Rolling wings-level from such an attitude may cause an illusion that the aircraft is banking in the opposite direction. In response to such an illusion, a pilot will tend to roll back in the direction of the original bank in a corrective attempt to regain the perception of a level attitude. = Graveyard spin = The graveyard spin is an illusion that can occur to a pilot who enters into a spin and is characterized by the pilot becoming less aware of the sense of rotation induced by the spin as the spin continues.Antunano, M. J. (2013). FAA Pilot Safety Brochures: Spatial Disorientation. Federal Aviation Administration. As the pilot becomes less aware of the spin, any correction of the spin may cause the pilot to sense that he or she is spinning in the opposite direction. As an example, if the airplane is spinning to the right but goes unnoticed for a period of time sufficient for the pilot to become desensitized to the magnitude of the spin, a small adjustment to the left rudder may leave the pilot with a sensation of spinning to the left. As a result, the pilot will apply right rudder and unknowingly re-enter the original right spin. Cross-checking the airplane's flight instruments would show that the airplane is still in a turn, which causes sensory conflict for the pilot. If the pilot does not correct the spin, the airplane will continue to lose altitude until contact with the terrain occurs. = Graveyard spiral = The graveyard spiral is characterized by a pilot who mistakenly believes they are in wings-level flight when the plane is in fact in a banking turn, and notices descent indicated on the plane's altimeter. The sensory disorientation of returning from a prolonged banking turn to wings-level flight can cause the pilot to re-enter the banking turn, as in the graveyard spin illusion. While the plane continues in the turn and begins to indicate a loss of altitude, the pilot will try to correct the loss of altitude by \\"pulling up\\" on the plane's controls. Attempting to adjust the controls in this way will have the effect of tightening the radius of the turn and eventually quickening the rate of descent until the pilot is visually cued to the nature of the error or contact with the terrain occurs. One of the most famous cases of an aircraft mishap from this form of spatial disorientation was the crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. over Martha's Vineyard in 1999.http://goflightmedicine.com/jfk-jr-piper-saratoga-mishap/ = Coriolis illusion = This involves the simultaneous stimulation of two semicircular canals and is associated with a sudden tilting (forward or backwards) of the pilot's head while the aircraft is turning. This can occur when tilting the head down (to look at an approach chart or to write on the knee pad), up (to look at an overhead instrument or switch), or sideways. This can produce an overpowering sensation that the aircraft is rolling, pitching, and yawing all at the same time, which can be compared with the sensation of rolling down a hillside. This illusion can make the pilot quickly become disoriented and lose control of the aircraft.  Vestibular/somatogravic  Somatogravic illusions are caused by linear accelerations. These illusions involving the utricle and the saccule of the vestibular system are most likely under conditions with unreliable or unavailable external visual references. = Inversion = An abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight can stimulate the otolith organs enough to create the illusion of tumbling backwards, or inversion illusion. The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft abruptly into a nose-low attitude, possibly intensifying this illusion. = Head-up = The head-up illusion involves a sudden forward linear acceleration during level flight where the pilot perceives the illusion that the nose of the aircraft is pitching up. The pilot's response to this illusion would be to push the yoke or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down. A night take-off from a well-lit airport into a totally dark sky (black hole) or a catapult take-off from an aircraft carrier can also lead to this illusion, and could result in a crash. = Head-down = The head-down illusion involves a sudden linear deceleration (air braking, lowering flaps, decreasing engine power) during level flight where the pilot perceives the illusion that the nose of the aircraft is pitching down. The pilot's response to this illusion would be to pitch the nose of the aircraft up. If this illusion occurs during a low- speed final approach, the pilot could stall the aircraft.  Visual  Visual illusions are familiar to most of us. Even under conditions of good visibility, one can experience visual illusions. = Linear perspective = This illusion may make a pilot change (increase or decrease) the slope of their final approach. They are caused by runways with different widths, upsloping or downsloping runways, and upsloping or downsloping final approach terrain. Pilots learn to recognize a normal final approach by developing and recalling a mental image of the expected relationship between the length and the width of an average runway. An example would be a pilot used to small general aviation fields visiting a large international airport. The much wider runway would give the pilot the mental picture of the point where they would usually begin the flare, when they are much higher than they should be. A pilot flying an aircraft where the cockpit height relative to the ground is vastly higher or lower than they are used to can cause a similar illusion in the last part of the approach.  Upsloping terrain or narrow or long runway  A final approach over an upsloping terrain with a flat runway, or to an unusually narrow or long runway may produce the visual illusion of being too high on final approach. The pilot may then increase their rate of descent, positioning the aircraft unusually low on the approach path.  Downsloping terrain or wide runway  A final approach over a downsloping terrain with a flat runway, or to an unusually wide runway may produce the visual illusion of being too low on final approach. The pilot may then pitch the aircraft's nose up to increase the altitude, which can result in a low-altitude stall or a missed approach. = Other =  Black-hole approach  A black-hole approach illusion can happen during a final approach at night (with no stars or moonlight) over water or unlit terrain to a lighted runway, in which the horizon is not visible. As the name suggests, it involves an approach to landing during the night where there is nothing to see between the aircraft and the intended runway, there is just a visual, “black-hole”.Newman, D. G. (2007). An overview of spatial disorientation as a factor in aviation accidents and incidents (No. B2007/0063). Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Pilots too often confidently proceed with a visual approach instead of relying on instruments during nighttime landings. As a result, this can lead to the pilot experiencing glide path overestimation (GPO) because of the lack of peripheral visual cues, especially, below the aircraft.Gibb, R. W. (2007). Visual spatial disorientation: revisiting the black hole illusion. Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 78(8), 801-808. In addition, with no peripheral visual cues allowing for an orientation relative to the earth there can be an illusion of the pilot being upright and the runway being tilted and sloping. As a result, they initiate an aggressive descent and wrongly adjust to an unsafe glide path below the desired three-degree glide path.  Autokinesis  The autokinetic illusion occurs at night or in conditions with poor visual cues. This illusion gives the pilot the impression that a stationary object is moving in front of the airplane's path; it is caused by staring at a fixed single point of light (ground light or a star) in a totally dark and featureless background. The reason why this visual illusion occurs is because of very small movements of the eyes. In conditions with poor visual cues accompanied by a single source of light, these eye movements are interpreted by the brain as movement of the object being viewed. This illusion can cause a misperception that such a light is on a collision course with the aircraft. Planets or stars in the night sky can often cause the illusion to occur. Often these bright stars or planets have been mistaken for landing lights of oncoming aircraft, satellites, or even UFOs. An example of a star that commonly causes this illusion is Sirius, which is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere and in winter appears over the entire continental United States at one to three fist-widths above the horizon. At dusk, the planet Venus can cause this illusion to occur and many pilots have mistaken it as lights coming from other aircraft Rossier, R. N. (2004). The Lessons We Forget-Distraction, disorientation and illusions. Business and Commercial Aviation, 95(3), 50-55.  False visual reference  False visual reference illusions may cause the pilot to orient the aircraft in relation to a false horizon; these illusions can be caused by flying over a banked cloud, night flying over featureless terrain with ground lights that are indistinguishable from a dark sky with stars, or night flying over a featureless terrain with a clearly defined pattern of ground lights and a dark, starless sky.  Vection  This is when the brain perceives peripheral motion, without sufficient other cues, as applying to itself. Consider the example of being in a car in lanes of traffic, when cars in the adjacent lane start creeping slowly forward. This can produce the perception of actually moving backwards, particularly if the wheels of the other cars are not visible. A similar illusion can happen while taxiing an aircraft.  Repeating pattern  This is when an aircraft is moving at very low altitude over a surface that has a regular repeating pattern, for example ripples on water. The pilot's eyes can misinterpret the altitude if each eye lines up different parts of the pattern rather than both eyes lining up on the same part. This leads to a large error in altitude perception, and any descent can result in impact with the surface. This illusion is of particular danger to helicopter pilots operating at a few metres altitude over calm water.

Its principal residence is the Tonhalle concert hall. Early history prior to the orchestra Precursor music ensembles in Zürich have included the music societies Zum Chorherresaal (around 1600), Ab dem Musiksaal beim Kornhaus (1613), and Zum Fraumünster (1679). In 1812, these ensembles consolidated into a single organization with the name Allgemeine Musik-Gesellschaft (AMG), which included the formation of an orchestra who performed on an annual, seasonal and non-permanent basis. In the early history of the AMG orchestra, its first principal conductors were Casimir von Blumenthal (1821–1846) and Franz Abt (1846–1852). The impetus for the establishment of a permanent orchestra in Zürich came in 1861, with the Schweizerische Musikfest (Swiss Music Festival) scheduled in Zürich that year. Citizens in Zürich wished the musicians to remain after the festival, but the AMG did not have the financial resources to establish a permanent resident orchestra. Subsequently, a group of Zürich citizens founded the Orchesterverein in 1865 as the city's first permanent orchestra. The founding of the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich followed several years later, in 1868. Both ensembles continue to perform in Zürich today. Orchestra history The first principal conductor of the Tonhalle-Orchester was Friedrich Hegar, who served from its founding in 1868 through 1906. His successor, Volkmar Andreae, served an even longer tenure as chief conductor, from 1906 to 1949, the longest in the orchestra's history, directing around 1,300 concerts with the orchestra. Andreae's tenure featured the first family concerts by the orchestra, beginning in 1928. In 1947, the city of Zürich formalised performances of concerts for young people by the orchestra, as part of the agreements for city funding and subsidy of the orchestra. More recently, during the chief conductorship of David Zinman, the orchestra established its \\"tonhalleLATE\\" series of late-evening concerts that combine shorter-length symphonic concerts with socializing afterwards to electronic music. In the interregnum between the chief conductorships of Hiroshi Wakasugi and David Zinman, Claus Peter Flor served as principal guest conductor from 1991 to 1995. Zinman became chief conductor in 1995, and remained in the post until July 2014, the orchestra's longest serving chief conductor since Andreae. The orchestra made its debut at The Proms in September 2003 with Zinman, and his final concert as chief conductor was a July 2014 Proms appearance. During his tenure, Zinman introduced elements of historically informed performance into the orchestra's playing style and greatly expanded their recording presence. In October 2012, the orchestra named Lionel Bringuier as its next chief conductor, as of the 2014–2015 season, with an initial contract of four years. Concurrent with the advent of Bringuier as chief conductor in the 2014–2015 season, Esa-Pekka Salonen began his tenure in the newly created post of Creative Chair of the orchestra. In August 2016, the orchestra announced that Bringuier is to conclude his Tonhalle tenure at the end of his current contract, at the end of the 2017–2018 season. In May 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Paavo Järvi as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019–2020 season, with an initial contract of five years. Järvi had first guest-conducted the Tonhalle Orchestra in 2009, and returned in December 2016. The orchestra and Andreae made a small number of recordings in the late 1920s, of music of Vivaldi and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In 1947, Franz Lehár recorded a number of 78-rpm discs of his music with the orchestra for Decca Records. The discs were issued in the U.S. by London Records, initially in the 78-rpm format and then on LPs. Some of the recordings are now available through Naxos Records on CD. The orchestra's recording profile has expanded most prominently during the tenure of Zinman, with many recordings for such labels as Arte Nova and RCA. In particular, his recordings for Arte Nova of the complete Beethoven symphonies achieved notable renown, as one of the earliest recorded cycles to use the new Jonathan Del Mar edition of the symphonies, with observation of Beethoven's metronome markings.

Distribution of the paper as a means of empowering the homeless is not embraced by everyone. Critics claim that the language used in the paper overly relies on emotional appeal and the act of vending forces vendors to conform to stereotypes of homelessness.Kurt Lindemann (2006) A Tough Sell: Stigma as Souvenir in the Contested Performances of San Francisco's Homeless Street Sheet Vendors, Text and Performance Quarterly, 27:1, 41-57, DOI: 10.1080/10462930601046012 See also * List of street newspapers References * External links * Street Sheet Website * Profile of former Street Sheet editor Chance Martin Publications established in 1989 Newspapers published in the San Francisco Bay Area Street newspapers ","title":"Street Sheet"},{"id":"3526722","text":"KLDK is a low-power radio station (\\"96.5 on your FM dial\\") located in Dixon, New Mexico.

The men's team competes in the Series 1, the sixth tier of the Danish football league system and the second tier of the regional DBU Zealand competitions. The club was founded on 18 May 1918 as Ølstykke Idrætsforening, as the club also had a basketball department. In 1986, the name was changed to Ølstykke FC as the club wanted to focus solely on football. History =Formation and rise through the divisions= Ølstykke Idrætsforening (Ø.I.F.) was founded as a sports association on 18 May 1918 with Aksel Larsen as the club's first chairman, and over the years had both association football and basketball as its main departments. The club joined the Zealand FA in 1938.See. \\"Sjællandsk Fodbold Gennem Tiderne\\" — volume 1 and 2, Edited by Axel Alstrup, Østergaards Forlag — Odense, 1954, pages 579-581. In September 1986, the sports association was dissolved, but already in January 1986, the football department was formed as an independent association under the new name Ølstykke Fodbold Club 1918 (ØFC) at a general board meeting. On 11 January 1986, Ølstykke Idræts Union was established at the founding general meeting and was to function as an umbrella organization for all sports associations in Ølstykke and a mouthpiece for, among others, Ølstykke Municipality. The board had a year before expressed a desire to focus solely on football and channel future funds and income to the club's first team under the project Resultater for alle pengene (\\"Results for all the money\\"). The first team experienced a series of successive promotions, starting from the local DBU Zealand Series 1 in 1981, to the Denmark Series in 1986 and finally advancing to the then third best Danish football series, 3rd Division East, in the 1988 season. Archived The club had previously flirted with the idea of becoming the first non- professional club in the Danish Superliga, the highest tier of the Danish football league system, which was said in half-serious half-joking fashion, and was to signal that the club's management had no intentions of running a professional football organization despite a promotion. Archived This stance changed at the beginning of 1996, when permission was granted to introduce professional football, including a new Aktieselskab (a holding company of sorts) with its own separate management, with the aim of ensuring greater continuity in the first-team squad. The club's first team played in the second tier for a number of seasons, with the team's best result being a 5th place (only one spot and three points from promotion to the Superliga), which happened in the spring season of 1995 in the former Kvalifikationsligaen. Archived The club's best result in the Danish Cup is reaching the semi-finals two seasons in a row, the 1989–90 season and the 1990–91 season. Archived Archived Former first team coaches for the club's first team include Michael Schäfer (1996–1998), Benny Johansen (2002–2004), Michele Guarini (2004–2006) and Clement Cliford (2008). =Plans of Egedal mergers= At the beginning of the 2000s, a youth collaboration was formed for the age groups U16, U17 and U19 between Ølstykke FC and nearby football clubs Stenløse Boldklub and Slagslunde-Ganløse Idrætsforening under the common team name \\"Team Egedal\\". Archived The first team which was represented in the higher tiers was renamed FC Egedal on 1 July 2009, and a new logo was created alongside a new green and white uniform, with plans of functioning as a professional superstructure of its parent club after an approval was granted by the Danish Football Union (DBU). Archived Archived Prior to this, the club board had failed in an attempt to buy out neighbour club Stenløse Boldklub to establish a broad elite superstructure between the two clubs. Archived Archived Archived Italian head coach, Giuseppe Favasuli, who took over as head coach in Ølstykke in May 2008, was scheduled to continue as the first head coach of the elite club's senior team in the Danish 2nd Division West. Archived However, all plans were abandoned shortly after, at the end of July of the same year, due to major financial problems in the professional company behind the elite team. Archived Archived As a consequence of its filing for bankruptcy in the DBU, the first team was forcibly relegated down two divisions before the start of the new season, and had to start the 2009-10 season in the highest regional division of the DBU Zealand, the Zealand Series. In 2011, the club eventually merged with the neighboring club Stenløse Boldklub and became SC Egedal. In 2015, Stenløse left the merger, and Ølstykke FC was re-established in Series 3, one of the bottom tiers of Danish football.

History  In 1889, Nebraska Christian University was established east of University Place, a town east of Lincoln centered around Nebraska Wesleyan University. The town was incorporated as Bethany Heights in 1890 and the college was renamed Cotner College. The town was named after the biblical village of Bethany, Palestine. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska—Lincoln Digital Commons. Bethany Heights did not enjoy the same success as Lincoln's other satellite communities. In 1920, Bethany Heights reported a population of 1,078. By comparison, University Place and College View, two other suburbs centered around religious colleges, reported populations of over 4,000 and 2,200 respectively in 1920. Havelock, a suburb near Bethany, reported 3,600 residents in 1920. Residents of Bethany Heights relied upon Lincoln for most services, including hospitals, lawyers, doctors, train depots, hotels, dry goods, and even cemeteries. Due to this reliance, the town voted to be annexed as Bethany by the city of Lincoln in 1922. However, the annexation did not come into effect until 1926 because its neighbor, University Place, had to be annexed first in order to create contiguous city limits. Unlike other Lincoln suburbs, such as Havelock, University Place, and College View, very little remains of the original town. Cotner College was demolished in the early 1950s and the land on which it stood was divided into single-family residential lots. The First State Bank of Bethany Heights is one of few landmarks from the original town and is not closely associated with the college or the town's foundation.

This mine was an early form of minimum metal mine, designed with the minimum amount of metal to reduce the likelihood of detection by the Polish mine detector then in use by Allied forces. The reduced use metal was beneficial because it saved this valuable war resource for other uses. Description Diagram of a Glasmine 43 from a US Army manual The mine consists of a glass bowl, in diameter containing an explosive charge and a detonator. The top of the mine was covered by a sheet-glass disk thick, under a thick, molded glass pressure plate. Each mine was supplied with a small quantity of cement putty to seal gaps between the main body and the glass disk cover and make the mine waterproof. When stepped on, the pressure plate shattered the glass disk and activated the detonator, detonating the mine's main explosive charge. This was a Sprengkörper 28 – a standard demolition charge with of explosive. Two types of detonator were used. Early versions of the mine used a mechanical detonator, known as a Hebelzünder 44 which used a percussion cap.Functioning, Assembly and Pictures of Glasminen (english) (Retrieved on 11 June 2012) Later versions fired the main charge using a device known as a Buck igniter. The Buck igniter was a small can of thin, corrugated aluminium. This contained a glass ampule of sulfuric acid, surrounded by flash powder that included powdered naphthalene. The can crushed when subjected to a pressure of around , shattering the ampule and causing the acid to mix with the powder.

Tabanera's efforts ensured that Argentina was the first Latin American nation to create a spaceflight organisation and in 1952 was one of the founding members of the International Astronautical Federation. Argentine Aldo Cocca was a pioneer in space law and helped originate the idea of space being the common heritage of humankind, later enshrined in United Nations treaties of the 1960s. = Comisión Nacional de Investigaciones Espaciales = In 1960, Tabanera was named head of the newly created Comisión Nacional de Investigaciones Espaciales CNIE (National Commission for Space Research), a forerunner agency founded in 1960. CNIE worked with the Argentine Air Force's Instituto de Investigaciones Aeronáuticas y Espaciales (IIAE) to develop a number of indigenous multistage high-altitude sounding rockets and missiles. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to send an object into space using an indigenously-developed rocket. During the 1970s, Argentina regularly launched the American two-stage solid-propellant Castor rocket up to 500 kilometers altitude. This rocket carried international experiments for several countries. = Condor Program = In the 1980s, Argentina took part in a multinational effort to develop the Condor missile. Under United States pressure, the Condor program was cancelled in 1991. The associated development and production facilities at Falda del Carmen were closed down, the Fabrica Militar de Aviones, which concentrated on development of surveillance satellites for Earth resource and environmental monitoring. = Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales = The present commission (CONAE) was created on 28 May 1991 during the government of Carlos Menem, after the cancellation of the military Condor missile program in an attempt to move all the commission efforts to civilian purposes. It received the Air Force aerospace facilities in Córdoba and Buenos Aires of the former CNIE, as well as some of the civil personnel involved in the cancelled project. Since the 1990s the new commission signed agreements with NASA and European agencies and has developed a number of Earth Observation satellites, including SAC-A, the failed mission SAC-B, and the SAC-C launched in 2000 and still operating.

The last of these attempts ended with the rocket falling in the side of the launcher structure without any fire or explosion due to the rocket being loaded with only 460 kg of fuel for a short combustion in order to test the engine in flight for a few seconds, no material, human or environmental harm resulting.http://www.conae.gov.ar/index.php/espanol/2014/565-se-remite- comunicado-de-la-conae-comision-n-acional-de-actividades-espaciales  Airborne Systems  CONAE is actually operating a self developed airborne SAR called SARAT. The radar is capable of obtaining full polarimetric L-band data with a resolution of 3 x 0.4 m. It is intended as a pre-SAOCOM test bench.  International cooperation  These missions will be part of the Italian- Argentine System of Satellites for Emergency Management (SIASGE), together with the Italian COSMO-SkyMed missions (see related article Orfeo Programme). Knowing the great advantages of combining the information provided by L and X Band radars and the convenience of a shorter revisit period, Argentina and Italy are joining efforts to develop this system, which will be fully devoted the provision of information to lessen the consequences of natural disasters. CONAE, in July 2003, joined the International Charter 'Space and Major Disasters', which aims to provide a unified system of space data acquisition and delivery to those affected by natural or man-made disasters through authorized users. The agency secured an agreement with the European Space Agency on 24 June 2009 for the installation of a 35-m antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory, near Malargüe, Mendoza. The facility will contribute to the ESA's Mars Express, Venus Express, and Rosetta space probe projects, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research and the ESA's planned Deep Space project. One of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock.Buenos Aires Herald: Interplanetary support station to be installed in ArgentinaArgentina Noticias: ESA will install an antenna in Mendoza  See also  * List of government space agencies * INVAP * ARSAT  References   External links  Space Research in Argentina NASA archive from 1965 Space programme of Argentina Government agencies of Argentina Space agencies Scientific organisations based in Argentina ","title":"Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales"},{"id":"3526808","text":"Flat Out is a solo album by Donald \\"Buck Dharma\\" Roeser, lead guitarist and vocalist for hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released in 1982 (see 1982 in music).

It is around southeast of Cambridge city centre. History The rectangular parish of Cherry Hinton occupies the western corner of Flendish hundred on the south-eastern outskirts of the city of Cambridge.British History Online : Cherry Hinton (See Hundreds of Cambridgeshire.) There are some pictures and a description of the parish church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website.The church's page at the Cambridgeshire Churches website Cherry Hinton has an entry in the Domesday Book: \\"Hintone: Count Alan. 4 mills.\\"Domesday Book Online (Cambridgeshire) (Alan Rufus ‘the Red', one of the Counts of Brittany, confiscated Hinton Manor from Edith, Harold II of England's common law first wife, Edith Swanneck: 'Eddeva The Fair') The War Ditches are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort (55 metres in diameter) where a massacre took place, now mostly lost to quarrying.British History Online : Cherry Hinton (See Cherry Hinton Pit)  Geography  The front of Cherry Hinton Hall Cherry Hinton lies about southeast of Cambridge city centre, and falls within the Cambridge City boundary but is geographically separated from it by the grounds of Cherry Hinton Hall, the airfield and the flooded chalk pits. The village itself is fairly compact. North of the village is Cambridge Airport; to the East is Fulbourn; to the South is Cherry Hinton Pit, a nature reserve formed from old chalk pits and then the Gog Magog Hills which rise to 75 metres. Outside the residential area the land is open farmland, with relatively few trees.  Demography  Substantial housing estate developments, both local authority and private have taken place in the village over the last 50 years. Housing is typically suburban with 2,200 people per square kilometre; 40% of housing being semi-detached and 60% being owner- occupied. In 2001 the population of the village was made up of 1,600 people under 16, 4,950 aged 16 to 59, and 1,750 over 60. Economy In common with changes in the post-war years most of the residents in employment work outside the village, in Cambridge and elsewhere. There are small industrial units scattered throughout the area, together with a thriving high-street with a selection of shops and small businesses. Marshall Aerospace, the aircraft maintenance company and owners of Cambridge Airport, to the North, has been a major employer in recent decades. In 2001 the economically active population was estimated at 4,186 (70% of the population aged 16 to 74). Unemployment was given as 2.4%. The village has three business areas: an industrial estate at the end of Coldham's Lane (between that and Church Lane) at the northern end of the High Street, and the Peterhouse Business park on the South-Eastern edge. The former site includes companies such as Inca Digital, Semitool, Storage King, and Carl Zeiss. The Peterhouse park includes the head office of the world-famous ARM processor designer, labs for the Human Nutrition Research Centre, and the head office of Cambridge Water. Lastly, Fulbourn Hospital (though not strictly within the village borders) is being redeveloped as a technology park, and houses many smaller companies, with offices of Illumina, Staffords, Syngeta, i2, Cambridge Light Technology, Boult Wade Tennant, Scientia, Ware Anthony Rust, and others.  Transport  There are sufficient road links to Cambridge and the surrounding area; nearly 60% of the population travel to work by motorised vehicle and 25% travel to work by foot or bicycle; it takes 20 minutes to cycle into the centre of Cambridge at a moderate pace, or 15 minutes to the railway station. Cherry Hinton High Street has a long- standing traffic calming system consisting of a series of chicanes, traffic islands and mini roundabouts that sometimes causes traffic jams. The hope is that drivers seeking a through route will use Yarrow Road (around the Eastern edge) instead. There is a railway through the village but no extant station; the nearest open railway stations are Cambridge itself (3 miles to the West), Shelford (3 miles to the South), and Dullingham (10 miles to the East). From Cambridge there are regular services to Kings Cross (via Hitchin), Liverpool Street, King's Lynn (via Ely), Norwich (via Ely and via Stowmarket), Ipswich, and Peterborough (via Ely). Up to the 1960s there was also a station at the far end of Fulbourn Village (called Fulbourne). = Cycle and Footpaths = Three non-road paths can be used to avoid traffic for part of these journeys. Daws Lane is a track leading from Sidney Farm Road to Snakey Path at a small bridge over Cherry Hinton Brook. The path meanders West beside the brook until it reaches the road called Burnside, which leads to Mill Road. Raised about 3' (1m) above water level the path is frequently used by cyclists and walkers. On the far, North, side of the brook, the flooded chalk pits are visible for most of their length. Another path, known as \\"The Tins\\", runs on the north side of the flooded chalk pits. It starts in Railway Street, cutting across Orchard Estate (where few houses still have the corrugated iron fences that give this path its name). Passing on in front of the Holiday Inn and Norman Way it then passes over the railway on a footbridge and on beside the Territorial Army centre. It meets Burnside somewhat closer to Mill Road than Snakey path, at the White Bridge.British History Online : Cherry Hinton There is also cycle path provision on various roads in the area, notably Cherry Hinton Road (linking with Hills Road), Fulbourn Road, Teversham Road, and Airport Way. =Buses= Citi 1 bus from Fulbourn to Arbury and the Citi 3 bus from Yarrow Road Tesco to Whitehill Estate/Fison Road combine for a frequency of a bus into the centre every 5 minutes, with an average journey time of approximately 20 minutes. Both of these services stop at the railway station and the Citi 1 additionally serves Addenbrooke's Hospital. A less frequent service (Citi 16/17) runs from St. Andrew's Church at the end of Coldham's Lane to the Beehive Retail Park and into town.  Public services  Cherry Hinton Library There are two health centres in the village, one of which (the Cherry Hinton Medical Centre) has a practice shared with Brookfields Health Centre on Seymour Street, Cambridge, the other (Cherry Hinton Surgery on High Street) is shared with \\"The Surgery\\" of Mill Road. In the High Street there are a number of shops including a Tesco Express supermarket, a newsagent, Children's society charity shop,Children's society : Cherry Hinton a Sue Ryder charity shop, a hairdresser, a barber, a bakery, two pharmacies, a cycle shop, a craft shop, two turf accountants and a post office. There is also a Tesco superstore towards Fulbourn. Meals are available at the Sitar Indian restaurant, the Golden Pizza Chinese/Pizza Takeaway and the Cherry House Chinese Takeaway & Chip Shop, as well as from the bakery which provides a variety of filled rolls and hot snack products during the day. There is a village hall and sports leisure centre (Cherry Hinton Village Leisure Centre) adjacent to the village library, with services currently operated by GLL on behalf of the City Council. The sports centre offers badminton, 5-a-side football, basketball as well as exercise classes and room hire. The village has a well-appointed recreation ground situated on the high street. Here children's play equipment and football fields for local fixtures are provided. It also has a park and children's play area, including paddling pools and tennis courts, in the grounds of Cherry Hinton Hall, which hosts the internationally recognised annual Cambridge Folk Festival. Cherry Hinton mostly falls within the jurisdiction of Cambridge City Council and Cambridgeshire County Council for Local Government Services although the easternmost parts are managed by South Cambs District Council.  Schools  Cherry Hinton C of E Primary School is situated on the High Street just next to the level crossing and near to St. Andrew's church. In September 2011, the school changed from an Infant School for children aged between 3 and 7 years to a Primary School for 3- to 11-year- old children. It is a Church School, founded by Trust Deed, and has 'Foundation' Governors, appointed by the Church of England. The school has been rated grade 2 (\\"good\\") school. Mary Waters, mother of Pink Floyd bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters, taught there during the 1950s and early 1960s. Colville Primary School is situated on Colville Road. It opened in the mid-1950s as a Junior School for 7 - 11 year-olds. Other primary schools, opened after the two above, include The Spinney Primary School, close to the village centre, and Bewick Bridge Community Primary School. Secondary schooling for most children is at Netherhall School on the south west edge of the village, or alternatively at St Bede's Inter-Church Comprehensive School. Independent schools in the village area include Cambridge International School and Holme Court School.  Cultural references  Fulbourn Hospital, to the East of Cherry Hinton was built as an asylum in the mid-19th century between the village and Fulbourn. Until recently the main Victorian building was used as a psychiatric hospital. It is this hospital which gave rise to the lines \\"Strong men have run for miles and miles, When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;\\" in the poem The Old Vicarage, Grantchester by Rupert Brooke. The settlement of Cherry Hinton gave its name to the Cherry Hinton Stakes a horse race for two- year-old thoroughbred fillies. This Group Two event run over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 m) on the July Course at nearby Newmarket Racecourse in early July was renamed the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes in 2013.

In the First World War, the Livens Projector became the standard means of delivering gas attacks by the British Army and it remained in its arsenal until the early years of the Second World War.The Use of Gas in the Field, 1940  History  The Livens Projector was created by Captain William Livens of the Royal Engineers.Palazzo, 2002, p. 103. Livens designed a number of novel weapons including a large calibre flame thrower, to engulf German trenches in burning oil, that was deployed at the Somme in 1916. (One of these weapons was partially excavated in 2010 for an episode of archaeological television programme Time Team, having been buried when the tunnel in which it was being built was hit by a German shell.) In the Second World War, he worked on petroleum warfare weapons such as the flame fougasse and various other flame weapons.LeFebure, 1926, p. 60Banks, 1946, p. 33 Prior to the invention of the Livens Projector, chemical weapons had been delivered either by cloud attacks or chemical-filled shells fired from howitzers. Cloud attacks at first were made by burying gas-filled cylinders just beyond the parapet of the attacker's trenches and then opening valves on the tanks when the wind was right. (Later British practice was to bring up flatcars with gas cylinders on a line parallel to the front to be attacked, and open the cylinders without removing them from the rail car.Ian V. Hogg, Gas, New York: Ballantine, 1975) This allowed a useful amount of gas to be released but there was danger that the wind would change and the gas drift back over the attacking troops. Chemical shells were much easier to aim but could not deliver nearly as much gas as a cylinder. Livens was in command of Z Company, the unit charged with developing and using flame and chemical weapons. Flame throwers and various means of dispensing chemicals had proven frustratingly limited in effect. During an attack on the Somme, Z Company encountered a party of Germans who were well dug in. Grenades did not shift them and Livens improvised a giant Molotov cocktail using two 5-gallon oil cans. When these were thrown into the German positions they were so effective that Harry Strange wondered whether it would be better to use containers to carry the flame to the enemy rather than relying on a complex flame thrower.Croddy, 2001, p138.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p20 Reflecting on the incident, Livens and Strange considered how a really large shell filled with fuel might be thrown by a mortar.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p30 Livens went on to develop a large, simple mortar that could throw a three-gallon drum of oil which would burst when it landed, spreading burning oil over the target. Livens came to the attention of General Hubert Gough who was impressed by his ideas and \\"wangled\\" everything that Livens needed for his large projector.Awards to Inventors, 1922, pp 51–62 On 25 July 1916 at Ovillers-la-Boisselle during the Battle of the Somme, Z Company used eighty projectors when the Australians were due to attack Pozières. The early versions had a short range and it was necessary to place the projectors forward in no-man's-land and the barrage neutralising the German machine-gun posts. Z Company rapidly developed the Livens Projector, increasing its range to and eventually an electrically triggered version with a range of used at the Battle of Messines in June 1917. The Livens Projector was then modified to fire canisters of poison gas rather than oil. This system was tested in secret, at Thiepval in September 1916 and Beaumont-Hamel in November. The Livens Projector was able to deliver a high concentration of gas a considerable distance. Each canister delivered as much gas as several gas shells. Without the need to reload, a barrage could be launched quickly, catching the enemy by surprise. Although the projectors were single-shot weapons they were cheap and used in hundreds or even thousands. The Livens Projector was also used to fire other substances. At one time or another the drums contained high explosive, oil and cotton-waste pellets, thermite, white phosphorus and \\"stinks\\". Used as giant stink bombs to trick the enemy, \\"stinks\\" were malodorous but harmless substances such as bone oil and amyl acetate used to simulate a poison gas attack, compelling the opponents to don cumbersome masks (which reduced the efficiency of German troops) on occasions when gas could not be safely employed.Foulkes 1934, p. 169. Alternatively, \\"stinks\\" could be used to artificially prolong the scale, discomfort and duration of genuine gas-attacks i.e. alternating projectiles containing \\"stinks\\" with phosgene, adamsite or chloropicrin. There was even a design for ammunition containing a dozen Mills bombs in the manner of a cluster bomb.Rawson 2006, p. 272. The Livens Projector remained in the arsenal of the British Army until the early years of the Second World War. Description Typical layout Phosgene bomb unearthed on the Somme, 2006 Extant projectile on display at the Royal Engineers Museum. The Livens Projector was designed to combine the advantages of gas cylinders and shells by firing a cylinder tank at the enemy.LeFebure (1926) p. 48–63 It consisted of a simple metal pipe that was set in a ground at a 45-degree angle. Specifications varied during the war. The early field improvisations in July 1916 near La Boselle based the barrel on oil drums, the projectile was an oil can. The production model was decided on in December 1916 after further successful field trials on the Somme. It was based on spare oxy-acetylene welded tubing.Ministry of Munitions History 1922, page 98–99 The 8-inch barrel became standard and was first used in number when 2,000 fired a salvo in the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. Barrels were supplied in three lengths depending on required range: for short range, for medium range and for maximum range.Ministry of Munitions History 1922, page 99–100 A drum in diameter and long, containing of gas, was shot out by an electrically initiated charge, giving it a range of about . On impact with the target, a burster charge would disperse the chemical filling over the area.United States Dept. of War, 1942, pp 12–13 It was also used to project flammable oil, as with 1,500 drums fired before the Battle of Messines in June 1917.Jones 2007, page 44 Oil was also tried on 20 September 1917 during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge with 290 projectors used in support of an attempt to capture Eagle Trench east of Langemarck. This included concrete bunkers and machine gun nests but the drums did not land in the trenches and failed to suppress the German defenders there.Farndale 1986, page 207British Official History (Military Operations France & Belgium 1917), page 270 Use As a rule, the projectors were sited out in the open some little way behind the front line so that digging, aiming (either by direct line of sight or by compass) and wiring up the electrical leads were easier. When camouflaged the positions would be unknown to the enemy so that although the enemy was able to recognise the direction of the location by the discharge flash he would be uncertain of the range. As such these installations could only be carried out at night. The digging of the narrow trenches did not involve much labour and later in the war the projectors were only buried to a depth of about a foot, instead of up to their muzzles.Foulkes 1934, p. 202. The projector was somewhat unreliable. To safeguard friendly forces from 'shorts' an area immediately ahead of the projector battery was cleared of troops before firing. This area allowed for the possibility of drums reaching only 60% of the estimated range and veering 20 degrees from the central line of fire by the wind or from some other cause. The projectors were also inaccurate, A British training manual of 1940 described it as, The projector's unreliability and inaccuracy were more than made up for by the weapon's principal advantages: it was a cheap, simple and extremely effective method of delivering chemical weapons. Typically, hundreds, or even thousands, of Livens projectors would be fired in unison during an attack to saturate the enemy lines with poison gas. German equivalent The Livens projector provided the Germans with inspiration for a similar device, known as the . Over eight hundred of these were used against the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto.

It was codenamed \\"Shiner\\" and originally consisted of two models, the Network Server 500/132 (\\"Shiner LE\\", i.e., \\"low-end\\") and the Network Server 700/150 (\\"Shiner HE\\", i.e., \\"high-end\\"), which got a companion model, the Network Server 700/200 (also \\"Shiner HE\\") with a faster CPU in November 1996. The machines were not a part of the Apple Macintosh line of computers; they were designed to run IBM's AIX operating system and their ROM specifically prevented booting the classic Mac OS. This makes them the last non-Macintosh desktop computers made by Apple to date. The 500/132, 700/150, and 97 sold in the U.S. market for $11,000, $15,000 and $19,000, respectively. Apple Network Servers are not to be confused with the Apple Workgroup Servers and the Macintosh Servers, which were Macintosh workstations that shipped with server software and used Mac OS; the sole exception, the Workgroup Server 95—a Quadra 950 with an added SCSI controller that shipped with A/UX—was also capable of running Mac OS. Apple did not have comparable server hardware in their product lineup again until the introduction of the Xserve in 2002. The product's short lifespan is attributed to significant financial troubles at Apple in early 1997. CEO Gil Amelio cancelled both Network Server and OpenDoc in the same meeting as it was determined that they were low priorities.https://web.archive.org/web/19970618032910/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/11/b3518120.htm  Hardware  The Apple Network Server's hardware was supposed to be based on a new logic board design specific to the product. During the development of the hardware, Apple abandoned the original mainboard design for unconfirmed reasons. In order to move forward and ship the product, Apple made modifications to the Power Macintosh 9500 logic board and ROM (locking out all Mac OS calls) and ported AIX to the new hardware. Whether related to the hardware change or by coincidence, Apple also abandoned its NetWare on PowerPC development (codename: Wormhole) at this time. The general logic board layout seems to suggest a close relationship with PowerPC-based RS/6000 systems by IBM, which also were designed to run AIX. On the other hand, many logic board components, especially the Open Firmware boot ROM, are similar to the \\"Tsunami\\" board used in the Power Macintosh 9500 and some Macintosh clones. While the circuit board layout of the Apple Network Server (ANS) may resemble RS/6000 systems, logically and physically it is almost identical to a Power Macintosh 9500 (PM9500), although running quite different firmware, and which is specific to its unique mission function. Starting at the top level bus and working downward in the bus hierarchy, at the top level is the CPU bus with a Hammerhead controller (Apple Part # 343S1190) which is also found on the PM9500. The CPU, as mentioned, is a PowerPC 604 or 604e. The CPU bus-to-PCI bus bridges are Bandit controllers (343S0020). Both the ANS and the PM9500 have two Bandit controllers and two separate PCI busses. All devices at the CPU bus level are identical between the ANS and PM9500. On both systems the CPU Bus Clock is supplied by the removable CPU card. However, on the ANS the clock buffer which splits the System Clock for all the CPU Bus Devices is on the logic board, whereas on the PowerMac 9500 the clock buffer is on the CPU card. The memory data lane controllers are different on the ANS from the ones on the PM9500, presumably because of added support for parity memory. The ANS memory data lane controllers are 343S1161 instead of 343S1141 as on the PM9500. However, the memory structure is the same with two banks of DIMM slots and support for memory interleaving when corresponding slots in different banks contain identical memory DIMMs. The ANS does have eight memory DIMM slots instead of the PM9500's twelve, but other Hammerhead-based machines such as the PM8500 also carry only eight memory DIMM slots. On the PCI bus, as mentioned above, the ANS uses the Bandit PCI bridge, just as the PM9500 does. The PCI bus arbiters are also identical (343S0182). The bus arbiters receive the PCI Bus Request signals and issue the Bus Grant Signals to the PCI slots and to the PCI bridge chips (Bandit). The interrupt manager and logic board IO controller is also the same. Both use Grand Central (343S1125). Grand Central is a device on the PCI bus. At the PCI bus, ANS parts ways with the PM9500 in a few ways. The ANS has two 53C825A SCSI chips with support for Fast & Wide SCSI operations, which are not present in the PM9500. These each appear as a separate PCI device on the PCI bus. The ANS also adds a Cirrus Logic 54M30 video controller as an additional PCI device. In all the ANS has three PCI devices which the PM9500 lacks. The ANS's PCI slots are also organized differently. On the PM9500, Grand Central and the first three PCI slots are supported by Bandit 1. The remaining three PCI slots are supported by Bandit 2. On the ANS, Grand Central, the two 53C825A SCSI chips, the 54M30 video controller and the upper two PCI slots are supported by Bandit 1. The remaining four PCI slots are supported by Bandit 2. Some may find it interesting that this (six devices supported by Bandit 1) confirms that the Bandit PCI Bridge and associated arbiter chip can directly (no PCI-PCI bridge required) support at least six PCI devices given proper firmware support. Going down further in the hierarchy, the Grand Central chip is a sort of I/O bus for miscellaneous logic board devices. Both the ANS and the PM9500 use the CURIO chip (AM79C950, custom part from AMD) to support serial ports, a slow (5 Mbit/s, 53C94/96 based) SCSI bus and 10Mbit/s ethernet. The SWIM floppy controller is also common to both machines and connected through the Grand Central chip. The ANS lacks the MESH SCSI chip (53CF94/6 derived Apple SCSI chip) which is present on the PM9600 and supports the internal Fast SCSI bus. Grand Central provides support for eleven system interrupts. On both the Macintosh and the ANS, each PCI slot contains only one interrupt line (up to four supported in PCI spec.) and each interrupt line is used by only one device. The interrupt map is different in the two machines, and this represents the most likely reason why inserting a PM9500 or PM9600 ROM in an ANS will not allow the machine to boot. The firmware expects certain interrupts to correspond to certain events, but the interrupt signal is physically connected to a different device than the firmware expects.Apple Network Server Hardware Developer Notes, Page 16. The CPU board of an ANS 700/200. The ANS 500/132 and 700/150 CPUs are made from the same board but each employs unique configuration jumpers. All ANS CPUs have an applied printed label (shown on the extreme left) which identifies the CPU's speed: 132, 150 or 200 MHz. As in this generation of Apple's PowerPC products, the installed processor card determines the system's CPU speed, and the system's bus speed is derived from the CPU's speed: 44 MHz for /132, and 50 MHz for /150 and /200. The ANS 500/132 uses a PowerPC 604 CPU clocked at 132 MHz, and the ANS 700/150 has the same family CPU but clocked at 150 MHz. Both have a L1 cache of 32 kB. The ANS 700/200 features the more advanced PowerPC 604e clocked at 200 MHz, with an L1 cache of 64 kB. The L2 cache of the ANS is mounted on a SIMM, with a standard size of 512 kB for the 500 and 1 MB for the 700s. Any ANS may have the 1 MB cache card fitted. The system bus speed is 44 MHz for the 500, and 50 MHz for the 700s or any ANS to which the 200 MHz processor card had been fitted. The ANS logic board has eight 168-pin DIMM parity RAM slots with four of them free (with a maximum amount of 512 MB of RAM specified). The ANS 500/132 shipped with 32 MB of RAM installed (4 × 8 MB 60 ns parity DIMMs manufactured by IBM) and the ANS 700/150 and the ANS 700/200 shipped with 48 MB (2 × 16 MB 60 ns + 2 × 8 MB parity DIMMs also manufactured by IBM). For all practical purposes, the maximum RAM configuration is 4 × 128 MB parity DIMMs (512 MB, total) or 8 × 64 MB parity DIMMs (also 512 MB total). The machine will not POST (i.e., will not pass the Power-on System Test) if more than 512 MB is installed. This is an absolute restriction built into the machine's ROM-DIMM. If even one RAM DIMM is non- parity, then parity checking is turned off for all RAM, in which case 70 ns RAM DIMMs are acceptable. FPM or EDO RAM DIMMs are acceptable, in any order, as the machine treats EDO RAM DIMMs as FPM RAM DIMMs. All Network Servers feature an internal two-channel Wide SCSI-2 controller (narrow, to the CD-ROM drive, and to any hard drives which have been installed with the Apple accessory Narrow SCSI-2 installation kit), an external 25-pin SCSI-1 connector and a standard 1.44 MB \\"SuperDrive\\" floppy. Six free PCI slots are available for expansion—parts supported under AIX include two Ethernet cards and a SCSI RAID card. Other ports include one ADB port, two serial ports and one AAUI port. Unlike all other Apple computers of the era, the ANS uses a VGA connector for the on-board video; an adapter for Apple displays was included.Apple technical specifications for the ANS 500/132 , ANS 700/150 and ANS 700/200 A unique aspect of the Apple Network Servers is their case: It is fully lockable and extremely accessible, it features a small LCD for diagnostics, and its front has seven device slots, with a CD-ROM and one hard drive mounted in them in the standard configuration. Additional hot-swappable SCSI hard drive modules or a DAT tape streamer can be added to the free slots. Optionally, the ANS 700 also supports redundant and hot-swappable power supply units and an internal drive rack for two further fixed hard drives. The case is large and heavy, at a height of , a width of , a depth of and a weight of over , with exact weight depending on hardware configuration. That means that while it is about the right width for a 19-inch rack, it requires at least 14 rack units in height. A third model in a smaller rack-mount case without the large disk array, the Network Server 300 (code named \\"Deep Dish\\", as in a deep dish pizza), never got past the prototype stage.Applefritter, on the ANS 300 Also in development but never released were CPU cards featuring two CPUs. Power Macintosh 9500 CPU cards, which were available with dual processors, were not compatible with the ANS. An ANS 500/132 may be upgraded to an ANS 500/200 by installing the 200 MHz processor accessory card. It is possible to upgrade an ANS 500 to an ANS 700 or to downgrade an ANS 700 to an ANS 500 simply by exchanging the power back panel and PSU(s), but it is necessary to completely disassemble the base of the ANS in order to accomplish such an upgrade or downgrade. An ANS 700 has but one input power connection, even though it has dual, independent PSUs. However, an ANS 700 may be easily converted into a dual primary power configuration (independent primary power, possibly, and desirably, from different power panels, one possibly backed up by an uninterruptible power supply) by removing the IEC input power connector and physically and electrically connecting two input power cordsets, one to each of the redundant PSUs. However, this modification probably invalidates the machine's UL Listing. Nevertheless, such a modification would implement a true N+1 redundancy configuration.  Software  The Network Servers were sold exclusively with AIX, in a version called \\"AIX for Apple Network Servers\\" with some Apple-specific features, like AppleShare services, added; two revisions, 4.1.4 and 4.1.5, exist. Apple's own Unix variant A/UX had already been discontinued and does not support the PowerPC. Due to their AIX OS and hardware similarities, the Network Servers are mostly binary compatible with the RS/6000 series. However, applications which rely on early RS/6000's POWER2 processor and Micro Channel bus are incompatible with the ANS's PowerPC CPU and PCI bus.Apple's AIX binary compatibility guide, mirrored on erik.co.uk During the development of the product, Apple tested alpha versions of Novell NetWare for PowerPC. Around the same time the hardware changed, the NetWare project ceased to be updated and later was abandoned. Apple also tested and produced limited numbers of ROM SIMMs which supported Windows NT for PowerPC on the Network Server 500 and 700. As an alternative to AIX it is possible, though complicated,shiner.info: Guide to installing Yellowdog Linux 2.x on the ANS to install PowerPC Linux or NetBSD on the ANS. It is possible, with prototype Macintosh ROMs, to boot an Apple Network Server 500 or 700 into Mac OS 7.5 or later, however Ethernet support was not complete. No reliable sources for the procedure or requirements exist.Discussion of the possibility of an ANS booting Mac OS from a mailing list archive Not only is the Ethernet different, but the display interface is as well. Using an Apple-branded, but DEC \\"Tulip\\" Ethernet card discusses using this card from a mailing list archive and a display card from a 9500 goes a long way towards achieving Mac OS capability but even this is not assured. Yellowdog Linux 2.x or 3.x is more assured, and NetBSD 1.5.x might be even better. Major issues remain, such as the dual \\"Bandit\\" bus controllers, the proprietary floppy format, and possibly the CD-ROM. UW-SCSI hard disks are seldom an issue and Apple even released an U-SCSI (but narrow) hard disk installation kit for the ANS even though an ANS is normally only equipped with UW-SCSI disks.  Status  , most Apple Network Servers had been removed from service and most had been returned to Apple or sold on the secondary market, either factory remanufactured or as-is, or sent to a recycler and crushed. It was once not uncommon for a well- featured ANS to barely recover the $0.99 minimum bid on eBay. Shipping of an ANS is expensive, about $100 from a U.S.-to-U.S. location, if sent via bulk shipping. Few, if any, replacement parts are available, particularly not the mechanical components. , Apple Network Servers are sometimes seen and sold for over US$2,000 on eBay.

Putnam was the son of George and Harriet (Lowell) Putnam. He graduated from Harvard in 1882, and proceeded to make a professional name for himself in legal and financial circles. Even before his marriage to Percival Lowell's sister, Elizabeth, in 1888, Putnam (who was also Percival's half third cousin) handled a large part of the Lowell family's finances, thus leaving Augustus Lowell and Percival free to pursue their interests in science and culture. Also a successful lawyer, Putnam eventually served as the primary lawyer for both Percival Lowell and the Lowell Observatory as well as working as a partner at the well- regarded law firm of Putnam, Putnam & Bell. Putnam's role in Lowell Observatory's history begins when Percival Lowell succumbed to severe nervous exhaustion in 1897. At this time, Putnam stepped in as the Observatory's trustee with A.E. Douglass serving as Director. Since Putnam's understanding of astronomy was minimal, he left many of the decisions about the operation of the Observatory to Douglass and contented himself with handling the Observatory's finances. As temporary trustee, he felt that it was not his place to make any dramatic changes in the Observatory's staff or location. Thus, an Observatory expedition and possibly a permanent move to South America was postponed, effectively establishing the Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Despite his conviction that he should not make any major changes to the Observatory, Putnam did become embroiled in the controversy surrounding T. J. J. See. See was employed at Lowell Observatory at that time, but was both an extremely unpopular man and also regarded as a bad scientist. Three Observatory employees had already resigned due to See's poor treatment of them, and Douglass began working to remove See from the Observatory staff. Putnam, however, had to make the final decision on the matter and he was the one to tell See that he had been dismissed. When Lowell returned to work in 1901, Putnam resumed his role as the financial and legal power behind the Observatory. He also continued his other business in Boston and New York City. When Lowell died in 1916, Putnam was placed in charge of investing Lowell's estate for the Observatory. Putnam died in June 1923, aged around 61, during Constance Lowell's attempt to contest Percival's will. Constance Lowell later asked William's son, Augustus, to become trustee. After Gus's death, William's second son, Roger, became trustee.Putnam, A Yankee Image: The Life and Times of Roger Lowell Putnam, 1991.

Originally planned as a line from Atchison west into Colorado, and given federal land grants by the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 as one of the branches of the Union Pacific Railroad, it was left with a hanging end at Waterville, Kansas when the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division, with which it was to connect, changed its route. The line was acquired by the Union Pacific through a stock purchase by Jay Gould and leased to the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1880. In 1909 the Central Branch was merged into the Missouri Pacific; the latter company came back into the Union Pacific system in 1982. In 1991 the remaining trackage west of Frankfort was leased to the Kyle Railroad. Despite its name, the Central Branch Union Pacific was not associated with the Union Pacific until 1880; it was to be one of several eastern branches of the First Transcontinental Railroad, of which the Union Pacific constituted the main line between Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska and Ogden, Utah where it connected with the Central Pacific Railroad. History Atchison & Pike's Peak RR Company stock certificateThe Kansas Territorial Legislature incorporated the Central Branch as the Atchison and Pike's Peak Railroad in February 1859, with the power to build from Atchison, on the Missouri River, west to the Kansas-Colorado line in the direction of Pike's Peak or Denver.Chapter 48: An Act to Incorporate the Atchison and Pike's Peak Railroad Company, approved February 11, 1859 Through an 1862 treaty between the Kickapoo Indians and U.S. government, part of that tribe's land was sold to the railroad company.Indian Land Cessions in the United States, pp. 826-827 It acquired more land from the land grant provisions of the Pacific Railway Act of 1862, which included a line to be built by the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad of Missouri, extending west from Atchison. The west end of this branch would be at an intersection with the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad, a planned connection from Kansas City to the main transcontinental line. The company would only receive land for the first from Atchison. The Hannibal and St. Joseph transferred its rights under the act to the Atchison and Pike's Peak in January 1864.Henry Kirke White, History of the Union Pacific Railway, 1895, pp. 48-52 Construction began in 1865, and the line was completed from Atchison west for in January 1867, and the rest of the 100 miles to Waterville in January 1868. The company changed its name to Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad in January 1867, better reflecting its purpose.Interstate Commerce Commission, 40 Val. Rep. 249 (1933): Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and Its Leased Lines Unfortunately for the Central Branch, the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division (formerly the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western) was authorized in 1866 to build west into Colorado, leaving the Central Branch with a hanging end at Waterville. After failing to get land grants for an extension along the Eastern Division's original route into Nebraska, the Central Branch turned its sights to local traffic. Several extensions and branches were built and leased in the late 1870s, beginning with the Waterville and Washington Railroad, incorporated in April 1876 and completed to Washington and leased to the Central Branch in December. Afterwards came the Republican Valley Rail Way from Greenleaf to Concordia (incorporated November 1876, leased 1877), Atchison, Solomon Valley and Denver Railway from Concordia to Cawker City (incorporated May 1878, leased August 1878), and Atchison and Denver Railway from Cawker City to Kirwin, with grading to Lenora (incorporated December 1878). The Atchison, Solomon Valley and Denver also built a branch from Downs (on the Atchison and Denver) to Alton, and the Atchison, Republican Valley and Pacific Railway (incorporated May 1878, leased January 1879) began construction of a branch into Nebraska, leaving the main line at Yuma and initially ending at Scandia. All five companies were merged in December 1879 as the Atchison, Colorado and Pacific Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary of the Central Branch that subsequently completed the line to Lenora and extended the branch from Scandia to Warwick. Completing the system of branches in Kansas was one more company: the Atchison, Jewell County and Western Railroad from Jamestown to Burr Oak (incorporated July 1879, leased March 1880). Map of the lines as builtJay Gould, who controlled the Kansas Pacific Railway (the new name for the old Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western), desired control of the Central Branch to avoid competition between eastern Kansas and Denver. He acquired a majority of stock in the Central Branch and its leased lines, turning it over in January 1880 to the Kansas Pacific, which was immediately merged into the Union Pacific Railway. In December 1880, Gould leased the system to the Missouri Pacific Railway (MoPac), another company that he controlled, which had a north-south line through Atchison. The final extension of the Central Branch in Kansas was the Rooks County Railroad from Alton to Stockton, incorporated March 1885 under MoPac ownership (as opposed to the UP control of the earlier companies) and leased November 1885. In order to extend the Warwick branch into Nebraska, the MoPac incorporated the Pacific Railway in Kansas and Pacific Railway in Nebraska in March 1887, and in September the former was sold to the latter. The MoPac began operating the line from Warwick to Superior, Nebraska in October 1887,Seventh Annual Report to Stockholders of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company for the Year Ending December 31, 1887, p. 7 and it was completed to Prosser in April 1888.Eighth Annual Report to the Directors and Stockholders of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company for the Year Ending December 31, 1888, p. 30 A separate Pacific Railway was incorporated in Nebraska in December 1887 to continue the line northwest to the western boundary of the state in Sioux County,Second Annual Report of the Board of Transportation for the Year Ending June 30, 1888, State of Nebraska, pp. 155-157 but this was never built, and Prosser would remain the end of the line. The Union Pacific went bankrupt after the Panic of 1893, and the Central Branch immediately followed, entering receivership in October 1893. It was sold under foreclosure in June 1898 to a new Central Branch Union Pacific Railway (replacing the old Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad), and the other two UP subsidiaries were similarly reorganized in December 1898 as the Atchison, Colorado and Pacific Railway and Atchison, Jewell County and Western Railway. The three were consolidated in July 1899 as the Central Branch Railway, now owned by the newly independent MoPac. Finally, in August 1909, the Central Branch Railway and Rooks County Railroad were merged, along with a number of other subsidiaries, into the MoPac, and in January 1910 the MoPac bought the property of the Pacific Railway in Nebraska (which began at Warwick, Kansas).

He was a nephew of Hugh and James Menzies and a first cousin of Sir Robert Menzies. Menzies was educated at Hobart High School and Devonport High School in Tasmania, before returning to Victoria to study at the University of Melbourne. He graduated with a Master of Laws, having been awarded the Jessie Leggatt and E. J. B. Num Scholarships, and having won the Supreme Court of Victoria's Prize in Law. Legal career In 1930, Menzies was admitted to the Victorian Bar, where he practised as a barrister. From 1941 to 1945, he was secretary to the Defence Committee and Chiefs of Staff, and from 1941 to 1950 he was a lecturer at the University of Melbourne. From 1956 to 1958, Menzies was the president of the Law Council of Australia, and in 1958, served as president of the Victorian Bar Council. High Court Menzies was appointed to the bench of the High Court on 12 June 1958, by the government of Robert Menzies, his cousin.

Generally unlike the more common DVD rip or screener recording methods which involve the duplication of officially distributed media, cam versions are original clandestine recordings made in movie theaters. Audience camming The most common type of cam is produced by a theater patron who smuggles a compact digital camcorder into the theater by hiding it in their clothing or in a container such as a handbag or backpack. The filmer then records the movie using the camcorder as unobtrusively as possible. They may try to pick a seat as far back in the theater as possible to avoid the attention of other patrons (and to ensure proper framing of the screen) and/or choose sparsely attended showtimes. The filmer may also rely on cinema employees who will overlook infringement activity because of an existing friend or family relationship, collusion, bribery, or apathy to the law. In an attempt to impede this practice (as well as curb the smuggling in of non- theater food), some establishments now ban customers from carrying bags or other containers into theaters. As an additional form of deterrent, theaters may equip ushers with night vision goggles to discreetly catch a bootlegger in the act of recording. Cams produced in this way use the camera's microphone to record audio, which tends to produce a recording that sounds \\"muddy\\". In addition, the microphone may pick up ambient noises in the theater, such as the audience's response to the film (e.g. laughter, screaming) or disruptive noises (crying baby, mobile phone ring, people coughing, etc.). In older or poorly maintained theaters, other sounds such as air conditioning or sound from adjacent theater screens may also be audible. In other cases a tripod is used in the handicapped sections of a cinema while plugging the jack in a hard-of-hearing device. These recordings with better sound are called telesync. A camera situated in the audience area may record silhouettes of other audience members, especially those leaving the theater for the restroom or concession stand. In parts of the world where the video standard is PAL, such as most European countries and Australia, the standard frame rate is 50i or 25p, which may result in video problems due to frame rate conversion between the 24fps film projection and the PAL camera. Projectionist camming Sometimes cam versions are made by projectionists themselves, either for home use or to distribute (with or without profit). This provides several advantages: first, the projection booth window has a central, unobstructed view of the screen. Second, the projectionist can bypass the built-in microphone and link the camcorder directly to the monitor output of the audio rack, resulting in a clear, well-separated stereo recording. The projectionist can also alleviate the frame rate conversion problem described above by speeding the projector up from film's traditional 24 fps to 25 fps and then use a standard PAL video camera to record the film picture. However, these advantages come at the price of higher risk: a projectionist, if caught, will almost certainly be dismissed, and is more likely than the typical audience member to face prosecution. Anti-piracy Since 2001, many major motion pictures have been shipped to theaters with watermarks of unique patterns of tiny dots embedded throughout the film, known as Coded Anti-Piracy technology. If the cammer is unable to catch and blur all of these sequences, the studio can determine at which theater the cam was recorded. Compared to other piracy methods The overall quality of cam bootlegs is highly dependent upon the choice of theater (and sometimes the individual screening), the quality of camera used, the skill of the operator in framing the screen and minimizing camera movement, and the method of encoding used before distribution. Cams are generally considered to be the lowest fidelity method for duplicating video and film content, somewhat behind Telesync and markedly worse than DVD rips or screeners. For newly released films, however, cams are often the first bootleg copies available. In the developing world, cam DVDs are often available from street vendors for prices equivalent to US$1–2 (PPP); worldwide, they are swapped or sold on Internet pirate sites. Origin Around the start of the millennium, many first time camera recordings originated from Malaysia, recognizable by the burn-in Malay subtitles. VCDs often appeared 2 to 3 days before the theatrical release. In some cases, they were even available online 3 months before release. Robert Krulwich sees two possibilities as the main reason for such early availability of these illicit recordings. Someone in Hollywood shows movies a couple of days before they show them in America, or some people get prints sent to them from people in the Californian movie business.

In mathematics, a rose (also known as a bouquet of n circles) is a topological space obtained by gluing together a collection of circles along a single point. The circles of the rose are called petals. Roses are important in algebraic topology, where they are closely related to free groups.  Definition  The fundamental group of the figure eight is the free group generated by a and b A rose is a wedge sum of circles. That is, the rose is the quotient space C/S, where C is a disjoint union of circles and S a set consisting of one point from each circle. As a cell complex, a rose has a single vertex, and one edge for each circle. This makes it a simple example of a topological graph. A rose with n petals can also be obtained by identifying n points on a single circle. The rose with two petals is known as the figure eight.  Relation to free groups  The universal cover of the figure eight can be visualized by the Cayley graph of the free group on two generators a and b The fundamental group of a rose is free, with one generator for each petal. The universal cover is an infinite tree, which can be identified with the Cayley graph of the free group. (This is a special case of the presentation complex associated to any presentation of a group.) The intermediate covers of the rose correspond to subgroups of the free group. The observation that any cover of a rose is a graph provides a simple proof that every subgroup of a free group is free (the Nielsen–Schreier theorem) Because the universal cover of a rose is contractible, the rose is actually an Eilenberg–MacLane space for the associated free group F. This implies that the cohomology groups Hn(F) are trivial for n ≥ 2.  Other properties  A figure eight in the torus. * Any connected graph is homotopy equivalent to a rose. Specifically, the rose is the quotient space of the graph obtained by collapsing a spanning tree. * A disc with n points removed (or a sphere with n + 1 points removed) deformation retracts onto a rose with n petals. One petal of the rose surrounds each of the removed points. * A torus with one point removed deformation retracts onto a figure eight, namely the union of two generating circles. More generally, a surface of genus g with one point removed deformation retracts onto a rose with 2g petals, namely the boundary of a fundamental polygon. * A rose can have infinitely many petals, leading to a fundamental group which is free on infinitely many generators. The rose with countably infinitely many petals is similar to the Hawaiian earring: there is a continuous bijection from this rose onto the Hawaiian earring, but the two are not homeomorphic. A rose with infinitely many petals is not compact, whereas the Hawaiian earing is compact.

He was the owner of two National Football League franchises; he was the first owner of the Baltimore Colts, and later switched teams, taking ownership of the Los Angeles Rams in 1972. During his stewardship of both franchises, Rosenbloom amassed the best ownership winning percentage in league history (.660), a total regular season record of 226 wins, 116 losses, and 8 ties, as well as 3 NFL championships (1958, 1959, 1968), and one Super Bowl (V). Rosenbloom has been described as the NFL's first modern owner and the first players' owner. Rosenbloom was part of the NFL inner circle that negotiated the league's network TV contracts with NBC and CBS and the NFL/AFL merger, both of which contributed to professional football becoming both profitable and the most watched spectator sport in the United States. Early life and education Born Dale Carroll Rosenbloom in Baltimore, Maryland, to Anna and Solomon Rosenbloom, he was the eighth of nine children, raised in a Jewish family. His father, an immigrant from Russian Poland, started a successful work-clothing manufacturing company. As a youth, Sports Illustrated described Rosenbloom as an \\"indifferent student\\" but a \\"good athlete,\\" and competed in football, baseball, and boxing. Rosenbloom graduated from Baltimore City College in 1926 then later that year attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he studied psychology and business and was a two-year letterman as a halfback on the football team in 1927 and 1928.2017 Penn Football Fact Book - University of Pennsylvania Athletics. At the time, the Quakers' backfield coach was Bert Bell, who became the commissioner of the NFL in . Business career Upon graduation, Rosenbloom returned to Baltimore to work for his father's clothing company. After being sent to liquidate the Blue Ridge Overalls Company, a small factory his father had acquired, Rosenbloom decided he wanted to run the fledgling company on his own. Based in Roanoke, Virginia, Blue Ridge had suffered during the Depression. But Rosenbloom was intent to turn it around. When the U.S. Civilian Conservation Corps was authorized in 1933 and officials needed denim work clothes, Rosenbloom successfully secured Blue Ridge a large order. By 1940, after attaining distribution through large channels like Sears-Roebuck and J.C. Penney, Blue Ridge had grown into a prosperous company allowing Rosenbloom to retire at 32. (As a youth, Rosenbloom told his brother Ben he planned to retire at 34.) During a brief retirement, Rosenbloom lived as a gentleman farmer on Maryland's Eastern Shore, growing corn and peaches. As well, during this time, Rosenbloom married Velma Anderson. Rosenbloom's father's death in 1942 cut his retirement short, however. When Rosenbloom was named the executor of his father's estate, he chose to return to business life. By 1959, Blue Ridge had grown to include almost a dozen shirt and overall companies and 7,000 employees, leading some to dub Rosenbloom \\"America's Overalls King.\\" In the financial interests of his family, Rosenbloom decided to sell the company to P & R, the price being $7 million in cash and more than $20 million in stock. At P & R, Rosenbloom served as a Director. With the success of his first enterprise, Rosenbloom diversified his business interests. In the late 1950s, Rosenbloom and his partners bought control of Universal Products Co. He went on to buy American Totalisator and other small companies, eventually lumping them all together under the name Universal Controls, Inc. Rosenbloom was one of the largest individual shareholders in Seven Arts Productions Limited, which backed the Broadway musical Funny Girl, and the films Lolita, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, and The Night of the Iguana. National Football League =Baltimore Colts (1953–1971)= After losing the original Colts team after the 1950 season, the city of Baltimore petitioned the NFL for another franchise. Around this time, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell wanted to find a new home for the Dallas Texans, an NFL expansion team that folded after one failed season in 1952. Bell sought a competitive new owner with financial resources. From their days together at Penn, Bell thought Rosenbloom would be a great fit. Though Rosenbloom was hesitant at first to own a franchise, he relented and bought the team along with a group of other investors. Rosenbloom's share cost him $13,000. In January 1953, the NFL awarded the city of Baltimore the franchise, with Rosenbloom as the principal owner. Adopting the nickname of the city's earlier professional incarnation, the Colts, Rosenbloom asked fans to give him five years to create a winning team. Before their first season, Rosenbloom helped organize one of the biggest trades in sports history: in exchange for ten Cleveland Browns, the Colts traded five players. Among the players traded to Baltimore were Don Shula, Art Spinney, Bert Rechichar, Carl Taseff, Ed Sharkey, Gern Nagler, Harry Agganis, Dick Batten, Stu Sheets, and Elmer Willhoite.A look at the history of the Colts , \\"Colts\\". Accessed December 15, 2010. In 1954, the Colts hired Weeb Ewbank as head coach. Ewbank led the Colts for nine seasons and won two conference and NFL Championships with the help of 1956 free agent quarterback Johnny Unitas. On November 30, 1958, the Colts clinched their first Western Conference title. Four weeks later, the team won its first NFL Championship, beating the New York Giants 23–17 at Yankee Stadium in what is regarded as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played,\\" six years after Rosenbloom purchased the team. The televised game, a sudden death thriller, served as a launching point for the start of the NFL's enormous boom in popularity. The Colts repeated as champions in 1959, again defeating the Giants, 31–16, for the NFL Championship before a home crowd at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. During the next three seasons, the Colts struggled and Green Bay won the division. In January 1963, Rosenbloom let go of Coach Ewbank and hired former player Don Shula, then the youngest coach in NFL history at age 33. Over the next several seasons the team did not win another championship but did make it to the NFL Championship game in 1964, losing to the Cleveland Browns and to Super Bowl III following the 1968 season, again to lose, this time to the underdog New York Jets, 16–7 (the Jets were coached by Ewbank). (The AFL–NFL Championship Game retroactively changed names to the Super Bowl in 1966 prior to the AFL-NFL merger of 1970.) After the 1969 season, Shula left Baltimore for Miami after Dolphins owner Joe Robbie tempted Shula with about $750,000 and other perks. Rosenbloom was furious and successfully argued that Miami had tampered with Shula. Because of the infraction, the NFL awarded Baltimore with Miami's 1971 first-round draft choice. Following the 1970 season on January 17, 1971, the Colts won a fourth league title, defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V in Miami. A fierce competitor, Rosenbloom had a profound interest in his team succeeding. Describing his commitment to the Colts and his experience running a franchise, Rosenbloom told Sports Illustrated magazine: \\"After the first year in football, I found that of all the things I've ever done, this is the thing. There is nothing more rewarding. You have everything wrapped up in one bundle. You meet much nicer people than you do in business. You meet the public, and you must learn to look out for them. There's no place where your word is more your bond than in sports. You'd never find 14 men who deal as fairly with one another as the 14 owners in the National Football League, particularly after some of the things that have gone on in business or on Wall Street. You play a part in the lives of young men, and you help them grow. And then every Sunday you have the great pleasure of dying.\\" However, while Rosenbloom loved the Colts, due to issues with Memorial Stadium and the city's officials, Rosenbloom wanted to leave Baltimore. In the next offseason in 1972, Rosenbloom completed a historic tax-free swapping of teams with new Los Angeles Rams owner Robert Irsay. When Rosenbloom left, he received recognition from his players. Colts linebacker Mike Curtis said, \\"I hate to see Carroll go. He was a damn good owner. It wasn't the coaches who made Baltimore a winner for 14 years.\\" =Los Angeles Rams (1972–1979)= Prior to the 1972 season, Rosenbloom assumed control as the majority owner of the Rams. The Rams remained solid contenders in the 1970s, winning seven straight NFC West division titles between 1973 and 1979. Though a strong team, the Rams lost the first four conference championship games they played in that decade, twice to Minnesota (1974, 1976) and twice to Dallas (1975, 1978) and failed to advance to a Super Bowl. In 1978, Rosenbloom announced plans to move the Rams to Anaheim Stadium in Orange County, citing dissatisfaction with the Los Angeles Coliseum and the location as the motives behind the move. (The move eventually occurred in 1980, over a year after Rosenbloom's death. The extra time was needed to retrofit the venue, which opened in for California Angels, from a baseball-only facility into a multi-purpose stadium.) Death and ensuing controversy While swimming at Golden Beach, Florida, Rosenbloom drowned on April 2, 1979. He was 72. Though Dr. Joseph H. Davis, the Dade County coroner, stated, \\"there is not one scintilla of reason to believe this is anything other than an unfortunate accident,\\" a PBS Frontline documentary called \\"An Unauthorized History of the NFL\\" suggested that Rosenbloom, a known gambler, may have been murdered. Son Steve Rosenbloom stated that his father was a poor swimmer who never went into water alone, telling Frontline \\"If he went out alone that day, he was breaking a habit of a lifetime.\\" The final conclusion was that Carroll, who had been one of the first heart bypass patients, had suffered a heart attack while swimming. Witnesses at the scene and the Miami coroner's office and the Miami chief of police confirmed this finding. After Rosenbloom's death, his second wife, Georgia Frontiere, inherited a 70% ownership stake in the Los Angeles Rams. Rosenbloom's five children inherited the other 30%.Georgia's Playbook, St. Louis Business Journal, January 26, 2003. Accessed December 15, 2010. Frontiere's inheritance came as a surprise to many fans (though not to close friends and family) who thought Steve Rosenbloom, the former owner's son from a previous marriage and the Rams' vice-president, would take a leadership role in the team's management. It was not a surprise to close friends and family because Rosenbloom was trying to take advantage of the widow's tax exemption. There was a draft of Rosenbloom's will that was to be changed so the team would be left to his son Steve. However, it was never executed. Over 900 people attended Rosenbloom's memorial service, including 15 NFL owners, sportscaster Howard Cosell, the entire Rams organization and actors Warren Beatty, Kirk Douglas, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Rod Steiger, and Henry Mancini. Influence on the NFL Rosenbloom influenced the modern day NFL in many ways, namely in that he envisioned that the league could be a successful business. In 1960, the NFL owners were deadlocked about naming a successor to Commissioner Bell. After reviewing 23 ballots, Rosenbloom brought up the name of Los Angeles Rams general manager Pete Rozelle as a compromise candidate because he had successfully made the Rams profitable. At the age of 33, Rozelle was elected commissioner. Rozelle, with the help of Rosenbloom, would spearhead equal revenue sharing of all TV contracts among the 12 league franchises, which helped make the league profitable and caused football to surpass baseball as the most watched spectator sport in the US upon his departure from the post in 1989. Upon Rosenbloom's death, Rozelle said, \\"Carroll Rosenbloom played a major role in the growth and success of the NFL, both through the teams he produced and through his active participation in the league's decision making process.\\" Rosenbloom was also influential in making the AFL-NFL merger possible. He helped push the merger forward in 1970 by taking $3 million and agreeing to move the Colts to the American Football Conference (along with the Browns and Steelers). He was also the NFL's first visible owner and its first players' owner, and envisioned revenue-generating stadiums and luxury suites before anyone else. Awards and recognition In 1960, the City of Baltimore awarded Rosenbloom the \\"Man of the Year Award.\\" Since his death, the Rams' players and coaches give the Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award to the team's rookie of the year. Rosenbloom was elected to the Rams' Ring of Honor. Personal life Rosenbloom was married to Velma Anderson, his first wife, when he met his second wife, 20 years his junior, who was also married, at a party hosted by his friend Joseph Kennedy at his Palm Beach estate in 1957. Rosenbloom met seven-times-married former lounge singer Georgia Frontiere, then a TV personality in Miami. Rosenbloom and Frontiere married in 1966, though they had been together for eight years and had two children together. When Rosenbloom died, Frontiere and his five children (Dan Rosenbloom, Steve Rosenbloom, and Suzanne Rosenbloom Irwin, from his first wife, and Lucia Rosenbloom Rodriguez and Chip Rosenbloom with Frontiere) survived him. His granddaughter (daughter of Suzanne) is married to Breck Eisner, son of Disney executive Michael Eisner.

The paper can be processed as loose leaves and in brochures (stitched, perfect bound). The holes usually serve for storage (filing), sometimes for decorative purposes.  Terminology  Paper drilling describes a technology for providing paper with round holes. For this purpose paper-drilling machines are used. Paper-drilling machines is the generic term for manual, motorised and fully automated paper drills. Paper- drilling machine Paper-drilling system describes an automated paper-drilling machine usually integrating several production steps into one continuous workflow. The phrase paper drill is used as well for paper-drilling machines as for the tools used for paper drilling.  Technology  Paper drilling is a method to drill round holes into paper and other materials. For this purpose hollow paper drill bits are clamped into a driven spindle which drills into the pile of paper. Paper drill bits are available for different hole sizes and in different coating qualities. Unlike hole punching, where only one or a few sheets may be processed, a large number of sheets can be processed with a paper-drilling machine. Depending on the type of paper drill, either the paper drill bits are lowered into the pile or the table is lifted. Paper-drilling machines can be equipped with a different number of spindles which are each built into one paper drill head. The range starts with one- and two-spindle paper drills for small volumes and office purposes and reaches up to paper- drilling platforms with more than 20 spindles / paper drill heads.  Applications  Applications for paper drilling are e.g. file holes for different ring binders, loose leaf collections, rows of holes for wire comb binding and tags. Many products processed on a paper drilling machine are stationery. Additionally catalogues, manuals and brochures are drilled on a paper-drilling system to be able to file them in a binder. Sometimes drilled holes are used for decorative purposes. Additionally to different stock types – e.g. offset paper, bond paper, glossy paper, coated paper - a modern paper- drilling machine can drill many other materials like plastic films, cardboard, foils etc. Some casinos use a paper drill to deface used decks of playing cards, a process known as canceling. Cards are canceled so that they cannot be marked by cheaters outside of the casino and surreptitiously brought back into play.  Users of paper drills  Paper-drilling machines are used in trade binderies, commercial print shops with finishing department, in-house print shops and copy shops. Depending on the volumes these companies operate many different types of paper-drilling machines – from simple one- and two-spindle hand-operated tabletop paper drills to standard motorised four-spindle paper- drilling machines and fully automated, integrated paper-drilling systems. These high-performance paper drills can run in-line with other finishing equipment.

It is important to differentiate between Powerwalls and displays that are just large, for example, the single projector display used in many lecture theatres. These displays rarely have a resolution higher than 1920x1080 pixels, and so present the same amount of information as on a standard desktop display. With Powerwall displays, users can view the display from a distance and see an overview of the data (context), but can also move to within arm’s length and see data in great detail (focus). This technique of moving around the display is known as physical navigation, and can help users to better understand their data. The first Powerwall display was installed at the University of Minnesota University of Minnesota PowerWall - http://www.lcse.umn.edu/research/powerwall/powerwall.html in 1994. It was made of four rear-projection displays, providing a resolution of 7.8 million pixels (3200x2400 pixels). Increases in graphic display power, combined with decreases in hardware costs, means that less hardware is required to drive such displays. In 2006, a 50–60 mega-pixel Powerwall display required a cluster of seven machines to drive it, in 2012 the same display could be driven by a single machine with three graphics cards, and in 2015 it could be driven by a single graphics card alone. Rather than seeing a decrease in the use of PC clusters as a result of this, we are instead seeing cluster-driven Powerwall displays with even higher resolutions. Currently, the highest resolution display in the world is the Reality Deck,Stony Brook Reality Deck - http://labs.cs.sunysb.edu/labs/vislab/reality-deck-home/ running at 1.5 billion pixels, powered by a cluster of 18 nodes. Interaction Both software and hardware techniques have been proposed to aid with Powerwall interaction. There have been several devices that use pointing for selection. This type of interaction is well supported for collaboration, and makes it possible for multiple users to interact simultaneously. Touch interfaces also support collaboration, and increasingly multi-touch interfaces are being overlaid on top of large displays. The physical size of the display, however, can leave users prone to fatigue. Mobile devices such as tablets can be used as interaction devices, but the secondary screen can distract users’ attention. It has been found that this issue can be addressed by adding physical widgets to the tablet’s screen. Finally, software techniques such as modifying the window management interface or providing a lens for selecting small targets has been found to speed up interaction. Visualisation In the field of medical visualisation, Powerwall displays have been used to render high-resolution, digitally scanned histology slides,The Leeds Virtual Microscope - http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/royr/research/rti/lvm.html where the high pixel count increases the volume of data that is rendered at any one time, and the context offered by the size of the display provides a spatial reference, aiding navigation through the visualization. The same principal can also be said for geographical data such as maps, where it has been found that the large display real estate increases performance for searching and route- tracing.R. Ball, M. Varghese, A. Sabri, D. Cox, C. Fierer, M. Peterson, B. Cartensen, and C. North. 2005. Evaluating the benefits of tiled displays for navigating maps. In Proceedings of the International Conference on HCI, pages 66–71. http://www.actapress.com/Abstract.aspx?paperId=22477 Rather than flooding the large display real estate with data, tools such as ForceSPIRE make use of semantic interaction to enable analysts to spatially cluster data. Collaboration Research on collaboration with Powerwall displays is related to that of tabletops, which suggests that partitioning the display space is crucial to efficient collaboration, and that distinct territories may be identified in the spatial layout of information. Physical movement, however, influences performance with large displays and the relative distance among collaborators also influences their interaction. Yet, most tabletop studies have participants sit down and stay put. A recent study found that during a collaborative sensemaking session in front of a multi-touch Powerwal display, the ability to physically navigate allowed users to fluidly shift between shared and personal spaces.

He was played by Frank Thornton, who went on to take the popular role of Truly in Last of the Summer Wine. Role Captain Peacock, the somewhat stuffy floorwalker, considers himself above the assistants with both his position and his dubious military record. Allegedly, despite his rank, Peacock began as a sweeper in the stockroom. By 1975 he had been working at Grace Brothers for 20 years. The question most viewers asked was: in what corps was Peacock a captain? In the pilot episode Mrs. Slocombe mentions annoyance with Peacock's posh \\"Royal Signals Corps voice\\". Although Peacock later brags about being in the Royal Engineers and his experiences fighting Rommel in North Africa, Mr. Mash likes to tell the staff that Peacock served in the NAAFI instead, and probably didn't ever leave England. Although Peacock usually talks as if he were a member of an elite Commando unit, on two occasions he admits he was in the Royal Army Service Corps (logistics) - in addition, throughout the series he wears the RASC tie.RASC Royal Army Service Corps Regimental Military Stripe Tie Mr. Goldberg, who blackmails Peacock into approving him to be hired to replace Mr. Tebbs, confirms that Peacock served in North Africa but seems to prove that Peacock's real rank was Corporal. Marriage trouble Captain Peacock considers himself to be something of a \\"ladies' man.\\" It is heavily implied in several episodes that Captain Peacock has had dalliances with women outside his marriage, mostly with ladies from the store such as the secretaries working for Mr. Rumbold (in particular Miss Belfridge). He has also been known to cast his eye towards Miss Brahms (who has referenced his attempts at seduction during office parties). He has even been known to flirt with Mrs. Slocombe occasionally (though this is the exception rather than the rule, as usually it is Mrs. Slocombe who uses her charms on him when she wants something). These situations have often got Captain Peacock into both marital and professional trouble (on one occasion the extremely jealous Mrs. Peacock confronts him while he's at work), but due to his quick wit he is usually able to work his way out of both situations. Relationships Captain Peacock generally tends to have a hate-hate relationship with whoever is the junior in the menswear department; Mr. Lucas, Mr. Spooner, and Mr. Humphries have all gotten the sharp end of his tongue (as their more carefree, relaxed attitude towards work clashes with his more professional demeanor). He sometimes clashes with the Senior Assistant of the menswear department, whether that be Mr. Grainger, Mr. Tebbs, Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Grossman, or Mr Klein, usually over a matter that involves the menswear department having to share floor or counter space with the ladies' department. He also irritated them whenever anything involving a promotion or the company boardroom was mentioned; they would become jealous as he had been at the store longer, while Peacock seemed to relish the opportunity to reinforce his senior position. Originally, Captain Peacock appeared to be just like the Grace Brothers management: old-fashioned, a sense of station, snobbish, upper-class, posh accent, who did everything by the book. However, as the series progressed, Peacock began to side more with the sales staff and go on strike, whenever pay rises did not come or cuts came, and he helped in taking charge of parties and offering comfort, most notably in \\"Forward Mr Grainger\\", \\"A Change Is As Good As A Rest\\", \\"Founder's Day\\", \\"Goodbye Mr Grainger\\", \\"The Club\\", \\"Anything You Can Do\\", \\"Is It Catching\\", \\"A Personal Problem\\", \\"Sit Out\\", \\"The Erotic Dreams Of Mrs Slocombe\\", \\"Monkey Business\\", \\"Lost And Found\\", \\"Goodbye Mrs Slocombe\\", \\"The Hold-Up\\", \\"Gambling Fever\\" and The Night Club\\".

Billings; placed in service on 19 July 1944; commissioned on 9 October 1944, with Commander R. D. Dean, USCG, in command; and reported to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Service history Charlotte cleared Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 January 1945 to take up what was to be her primary mission through her naval service, sailing to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, where she took up weather station duty. Flashing news of weather conditions from her post at sea, she helped make it possible for specialists to prepare weather predictions.

Later, she towed Tenacity to Boston, but by 5 April was back on her weather station. Similar duty in the North Atlantic, during which she kept alert for the possibility of rescuing downed aviators, continued until 17 January 1946, when she sailed from Boston for a weather station off Bermuda. Charlotte arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 March 1946, and was decommissioned there on 16 April 1946.

The Golden Age proper is in practice usually taken to refer to a type of fiction which was predominant in the 1920s and 1930s but had been written since at least 1911 and is still being written—though much less—today. In his history of the detective story, Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel, the author Julian Symons heads two chapters devoted to the Golden Age as \\"the Twenties\\" and \\"the Thirties\\". Symons notes that Philip Van Doren Stern's article, \\"The Case of the Corpse in the Blind Alley\\" (1941)Stern, Philip Van Doren. \\"The Case of the Corpse in the Blind Alley\\", Virginia Quarterly Review, Vol. 17, 1941, pp 227–236.

London: Faber and Faber, 1972 (with revisions in Penguin Books, 1974). . Page 149 (Penguin edition). Most of the authors of the Golden Age were British: Margery Allingham (1904–1966), Anthony Berkeley (aka Francis Iles, 1893–1971), Nicholas Blake (1904–1972), G.K. Chesterton (1874–1936), Dame Agatha Christie (1890–1976), Edmund Crispin (1921–1978), Freeman Wills Crofts (1879–1957), R.

Ronald Knox (1888–1957), E.C.R. Lorac (1894–1958), Philip MacDonald (1900–1980), John Rhode (1884–1964), Dorothy L. Sayers (1893–1957), Josephine Tey (1896–1952), Henry Wade (1887–1969), and many more. Dame Ngaio Marsh (1895–1982), was a New Zealander but was also British, as was her detective Roderick Alleyn. Georges Simenon was from Belgium and wrote in French; his detective, Jules Maigret, was a Frenchman. Some writers, such as Mary Roberts Rinehart, S. S. Van Dine, Earl Derr Biggers, John Dickson Carr, Ellery Queen, Erle Stanley Gardner and Elizabeth Daly, were American but had similar styles. Others, such as Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain, had a more hard-boiled, American style The Queens of Crime is a term for authors Christie, Sayers, Allingham and Marsh. Description of the genre Certain conventions and clichés were established that limited any surprises on the part of the reader to the details of the plot and, primarily, to the identity of the murderer. The majority of novels of that era were \\"whodunits\\", and several authors excelled, after misleading their readers successfully, in revealing the least likely suspect convincingly as the villain. There was also a predilection for certain casts of characters and certain settings in a secluded English country house and its upper-class inhabitants (although they were generally landed gentry; not aristocracy with their country house as a second house). The rules of the game – and Golden Age mysteries were considered games – were codified in 1929 by Ronald Knox.From the Introduction to The Best Detective Stories of 1928–29. Reprinted in Haycraft, Howard, Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story, Revised edition, New York: Biblio and Tannen, 1976. According to Knox, a detective story Knox's \\"Ten Commandments\\" (or \\"Decalogue\\") are as follows: #The criminal must be mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has been allowed to know. #All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course. #Not more than one secret room or passage is allowable. #No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end. #No Chinaman must figure in the story. #No accident must ever help the detective, nor must he ever have an unaccountable intuition which proves to be right. #The detective himself must not commit the crime. #The detective is bound to declare any clues which he may discover. #The \\"sidekick\\" of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal from the reader any thoughts which pass through his mind: his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader. #Twin brothers, and doubles generally, must not appear unless we have been duly prepared for them. A similar but more detailed list of prerequisites was prepared by S. S. Van Dine in an article entitled \\"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories\\" which appeared in The American Magazine in September 1928. They are commonly referred to as Van Dine's Commandments.Van Dine's Commandments (Last backup found On Web Archive, removed during 2012.) Decline and fall The outbreak of the Second World War is often taken as a beginning of the end for the light-hearted, straightforward \\"whodunit\\" of the Golden Age. But as Ian Ousby writes, the Golden Age Attacks on the genre were made by the influential writer and critic Julian Symons (who was dismissive of postwar detective fiction in Bloody Murder), Edmund Wilson (\\"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\\"),Wilson, Edmund. \\"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\\", The New Yorker. June 20, 1945. and Raymond Chandler (\\"The Simple Art of Murder\\").Chandler, Raymond. \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\", The Atlantic Monthly\\". December 1944. But in sheer number of sales — particularly those of Agatha Christie — modern detective fiction has never approached the popularity of Golden Age writing. Enduring influence Current writing influenced by the Golden Age style is often referred to as \\"cosy\\" mystery writing, as distinct from the \\"hardboiled\\" style popular in the United States. Recent writers working in this style include Sarah Caudwell, Ruth Dudley Edwards, Peter Lovesey and Simon Brett. Television series that emulate the style include Murder, She Wrote and Midsomer Murders. Films and TV series based on the classic Golden Age novels continue to be produced. The Country house mystery was a popular genre of English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; set in the residences of the gentry and often involving a murder in a country house temporarily isolated by a snowstorm or similar with the suspects all at a weekend house party. The board game Cluedo (Clue in North America) relies on the structure of the country house mystery.

He is currently serving at Bellevue Baptist Church in Cordova (a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee), one of the largest congregations in the Southern Baptist Convention. On Sunday, July 10, 2005 the Pastor Search Committee of Bellevue Baptist Church presented Dr. Steve Gaines to the church congregation. At the conclusion of the services the Bellevue family overwhelmingly voted to call Steve Gaines as the seventh Pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church.Bellevue.org ,Bellevue Baptist Church Website, Accessed November 20, 2009. Gaines succeeds the longtime Bellevue pastor Adrian Rogers. Before arriving at Bellevue Baptist, Gaines pastored for 14 years at the Gardendale First Baptist Church, an 8,500-member church in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. There he became one of the leading voices in the conservative wing of the SBC. In 2004, Gaines was elected president of the Southern Baptist Pastors' Conference, and was the keynote speaker at the SBC annual meeting in Nashville. He served with his predecessor at Bellevue and three-time SBC president, Adrian Rogers, on a committee charged with revising The Baptist Faith and Message. The document, which is the primary doctrinal statement for all SBC agencies, including its six seminaries and International Mission Board, was adopted by the SBC in 2000. On March 9, 2016, Dr. Johnny Hunt announced he would nominate Gaines to be President of the Southern Baptist Convention at the upcoming SBC annual meeting in St. Louis, Missouri. He was elected, and was then re-elected for a second one-year term at the 2017 annual meeting in Phoenix, Arizona. Gaines' theology is best described as conservative and evangelical.  Early life  Born to parents Edgar and Dorothy Gaines, Steve and his only sibling, Ed, spent most of their youth in the small town of Dyersburg, Tennessee. Their father worked for the Illinois Central Railroad and retired in 1976 as a track supervisor. Their mother founded and supervised a janitorial business in Dyersburg, for which both Gaines and his brother worked. He was baptized by his pastor at First Baptist Church in Dyersburg, Dr. Robert Orr. During his senior year at Dyersburg High School, Gaines was selected as first team defensive end in the Big Ten Conference and as All-District in track. He entered the University of Tennessee at Martin (UTM) on a full football scholarship in the fall of 1975. By the third game of his freshman season, he shared a starting defensive end position with a senior teammate. At UTM, he began attending weekly meetings of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. In the fall of 1977 he gave up his football scholarship to transfer to Union University, a Christian college in Jackson, Tennessee. On October 23, 1977, Steve Gaines was licensed to the Gospel ministry by his home church in Dyersburg.  Family  At Union University, Gaines met Memphian Donna Dodds, a campus leader who was selected as Miss Union University. Their first date was in December 1978, and they were married on June 14, 1980. Donna Gaines is a Bible teacher and author who leads women's ministries at Bellevue and speaks at churches and conferences across the nation. She has a Master's of Education from Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas, and is board certified as an educational diagnostician. Steve and Donna Gaines have four children.  Education  After graduating from Union University in 1979, Gaines began studies for a Master of Divinity degree at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. For seven years he served as Professor Roy Fish's grader, longer than anyone else to ever hold that position. In the final year of his master's program, the seminary preaching faculty awarded Steve with the H. C. Brown, Jr. Preaching Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement in the Study and Practice of Preaching.\\" At the same time, the evangelism faculty presented him with the W. Fred Swank Evangelism Award for best demonstrating the spirit of evangelism as a graduating student. Fred Swank was the legendary pastor of Sagamore Hill Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the only Southwestern Seminary graduate to ever receive both awards. For Senior Preaching Week, Gaines was selected to preach in the seminary's chapel services before his professors and peers. He graduated with his Master's of Divinity on May 11, 1984. He began doctoral seminars at Southwestern in the fall of 1985, majoring in preaching and minoring in evangelism. Dr. Fish's course on The History of Spiritual Awakenings particularly inspired him to pray and seek genuine revival for America. His doctoral dissertation was entitled, \\"An Analysis of the Correlation between Representative Baptist Hour Sermons by Herschel H. Hobbs and Selected Articles of The Baptist Faith and Message.\\" He graduated from Southwestern Seminary with a Ph.D. on May 10, 1991.  Ministry  On July 27, 1980, Steve was ordained to the Gospel ministry at First Baptist Church, Dyersburg. In 1978 he became youth pastor at First Baptist Church in Milan, Tennessee, where he served for a little more than two years before beginning studies at Southwestern Seminary. While a student at Southwestern Seminary, he was associate pastor/youth minister at Lake Shore Baptist Church in Lake Dallas, Texas. When the pastor resigned, he was asked to serve as the church's interim pastor, and six months later the church called him as pastor. The church grew steadily during the next five years, adding an educational wing and renovating the church facility. The church also planted Shady Shores Baptist Church in Shady Shores, Texas, during Gaines’ tenure as pastor there. After eight years in Texas, Gaines returned to Jackson, Tennessee, in 1988 to serve as pastor of West Jackson Baptist Church. In 1991, First Baptist Church in Gardendale, Alabama called him to be the pastor. For 14 years of his ministry at Gardendale, the church membership grew exponentially. For the Easter 2005, services were held at the Birmingham–Jefferson Civic Center where more than 10,000 people attended.\\"Pastor Walks Humbly at Bellevue\\", The Commercial Appeal, September 11, 2005.  Involvement with Bellevue  While serving in Alabama, Steve was an annual guest speaker at Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, at the invitation of Pastor Adrian Rogers. After Rogers’ retirement in 2005, the church voted to call Gaines as pastor. On July 10, 2005, Gaines accepted the call and preached to more than 10,000 people in two morning worship services. He preached his first sermon as pastor on September 11, 2005. Numerical growth in every area of the church's life marked Gaines’ first year at Bellevue, but the church experienced leadership transition difficulties in the second year. = Bellevue Loves Memphis = In 2007 Gaines initiated a church-wide, ongoing volunteer ministry to Memphis and the community. On September 28, 2009, the State of Tennessee House of Representatives issued a proclamation recognizing Bellevue as an institution that has demonstrated \\"unflagging capacity for love, dedication of spirit, and faith in God\\" and for enriching the lives of people in their community.Bellevue Loves Memphis , Richardson, Cyndi; Adams, Paul (historian), Bellevue Baptist Church website. The proclamation cited pastor Gaines’ for leading the way in showing \\"Jesus’ love to the City of Memphis by meeting practical needs of residents\\" and for \\"embracing Bellevue Loves Memphis as a way of life.\\" The document mentioned the church's sponsor of a Christian Mobile Dental Clinic that provides free dental care to the underprivileged, and the church's funding of The Vue, a ministry for college students located near the University of Memphis and accessible to students of other local colleges and universities. The proclamation noted that on six workdays, 5,300 volunteers have contributed between 30,000-35,000 hours through yard work, painting, construction, and more to benefit 40 schools, two post-secondary schools, 44 churches, 55 family homes, 14 parks, nine city/government buildings, 16 hospitals, 47 ministries, and ten Memphis City School football fields. The proclamation also noted that Bellevue Loves Memphis provided every city fire station with a copy of the movie Fireproof, assisted with the City of Memphis cleanup, and assisted with ten block parties. The document also recognized the church for hosting the Tennessee Technology Center's 2008–2009 graduation. The church has also opened its facilities for city and county school in-service meetings and for city and county school graduation ceremonies.  Recognition  In April 2009, Dr. Gaines was honored with the \\"Open Door Award\\" by the April 4th foundation.The Open Door Award, Dr. Steve Gaines This was in recognition \\"His passion for evangelism (which) has galvanized his congregation to reach their city with the Gospel in unprecedented ways by meeting practical needs throughout Memphis.\\" =Southern Baptist Convention= On March 10 of 2016, Pastor Johnny Hunt of FBC Woodstock (Georgia) announced his intentions to nominate Dr. Steve Gaines for president of the Southern Baptist Convention. \\"When Steve Gaines shared his prayer journey he and [his wife] Donna had travelled, I was touched by his clear call to allow himself to be nominated\\", said Pastor Hunt in a news release.

Handling of minister misconduct  On December 18, 2006, the church announced that a minister and staffer at the church for thirty-four years had been placed on leave with an investigation pending regarding a \\"moral failure\\", identified by Gaines and others as alleged child molestation in the 1980s.\\"'People losing trust' in Bellevue pastor, seminary leader says\\", by James Dowd, The Commercial Appeal, December 20, 2006.

His advocacy for plans to conquer the rival state of Eastern Wu finally persuaded Emperor Wu to carry them out, but he did not live to see the plans implemented. He was known for his humility and foresight. Chen Shou, who wrote the Records of the Three Kingdoms, described him as a man of medium height with fine eyebrows and a beautiful beard. Life Both Yang Hu's grandfather Yang Xu () and father Yang Dao () were commandery administrators, and his mother was a daughter of the Han dynasty historian and musician Cai Yong. His sister Yang Huiyu was Sima Shi's third wife, subsequently honoured as an empress dowager after Emperor Wu established the Jin dynasty in 266. Yang Hu lost his father at age 11. He was raised by his uncle Yang Chen () and served his uncle faithfully. As he matured, he became known for his intelligence, knowledge, and physical beauty. The general Xiahou Wei became impressed with him and married his niece (Xiahou Ba's daughter) to Yang Hu. After his father- in-law defected to Shu Han in 249 in light of Sima Yi's coup against Cao Shuang, Yang Hu was one of the few who were related by marriage who still dared to associate with the Xiahou clan. He served as a low level official during the reigns of the Cao Wei emperors Cao Mao and Cao Huan. Because he warned Sima Zhao of Zhong Hui's intentions, Sima Zhao trusted his judgment greatly after Zhong Hui rebelled (as he predicted) in 264. After this, he went on to serve as an executive secretary for Sima Zhao. After Sima Zhao's death in 265, his son Sima Yan succeeded him, and in the following year forced Cao Huan to abdicate in favour of him, ending Cao Wei and establishing the Jin dynasty (as Emperor Wu). Emperor Wu wanted to make Yang Hu a duke, but the latter declined. Throughout the early part of Emperor Wu's reign, Yang Hu was one of the few key officials who strenuously advocated for the conquest of the rival state Eastern Wu. Emperor Wu, who liked the strategies that Yang Hu submitted, had him take charge of the western border with Eastern Wu and stationed him at Xiangyang. In 272, Yang Hu participated in a failed mission to rescue the Eastern Wu defector Bu Chan from Xiling (西陵; in present-day Yichang, Hubei), and was temporarily demoted, but was soon restored to his rank. After that defeat he set up a détente with the Eastern Wu general Lu Kang and treated the Eastern Wu border residents with kindness, with intent to win over their loyalty. His efforts succeeded, though Lu Kang attempted to counter with his own gestures of goodwill. After Lu Kang's death in 274, the Eastern Wu border residents became increasingly impressed with the Jin dynasty in light of Yang Hu's kindness. By 277, Yang Hu had fallen ill. While his plans of conquest had already been submitted and accepted by Emperor Wu, they were not ready for implementation. He performed his final act in the service of the empire – by recommending the capable Du Yu to succeed him. Du Yu would eventually go on to be a major part of the campaign against Eastern Wu. He died in 278. The people of Xiangyang built a monument for Yang Hu on Mount Xian (), and ever after Yang Hu's death, visitors to the monument often wept in memory of his benevolent governance, and so the monument became known as the \\"Monument of Tears\\" (). After the Jin dynasty conquered Eastern Wu in 280, Emperor Wu had the declaration of victory read at Yang Hu's shrine, and awarded his wife, Lady Xiahou, an estate of over 5,000 taxable households in appreciation.

Plan International is one of the world's largest organisations working for children's rights and gender equality. In 2016, Plan International reached 17.1 million girls and 15.5 million boys through its programming. Plan International focuses on child protection, education, child participation, economic security, emergencies, health, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and water and sanitation. Plan International provides training in disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and has worked on relief efforts in countries including Haiti, Colombia and Japan. Plan International also sponsors the Because I Am a Girl campaign, which is envisioned as a global movement to ensure girls everywhere can learn, lead, decide and thrive.  History  Plan International's country office in Niamey, Niger Plan International was founded in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War by British journalist John Langdon-Davies and aid worker Eric Muggeridge. The organization was founded with the aim to provide food, accommodation and education to children whose lives had been disrupted by the Spanish Civil War. =Timeline= *1930s – Plan International was founded as\\"Foster Parents Plan for Children in Spain.\\" *1940s – During World War II, the organization became known as \\"Foster Parents Plan for War Children\\" and worked in England, helping displaced children from all over Europe. After the war, Plan International extended aid to children in France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece and briefly in Poland, Czechoslovakia and China. *1950s – As Europe recovered, Plan International gradually moved out of these countries and opened new programs in less developed countries. It became \\"Foster Parents Plan Inc.\\" to reflect the goal of bringing lasting change to the lives of children in need, whatever their circumstances. *1960s – Foster Parents Plan expanded its work to countries in South America and Asia. In 1962, U.S. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was honorary chairwoman during Plan's Silver Jubilee. *1970s – In 1974, the global name became Plan International as programs now spanned South America, Asia and Africa. *1980s – Belgium, Germany, Japan and the UK joined Canada, the US, Australia and the Netherlands as donor countries. Plan International was recognised by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. *1990s – Plan International offices opened in France, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and the Republic of Korea. *2000s – The name Plan International evolved and a unified global identity was created to help make the organization more easily recognized around the world, and the logo was updated. *2017 – Plan International launched a new \\"International Global Strategy 2017–2022\\", which places an added emphasis on working with girls. The traditional blue logo was updated.  Funding and accountability  Plan International's income comes from supporters who sponsor children and the remainder is raised through donations and grants. An average of 77% of this money goes directly to supporting Plan International’s development and humanitarian work. The remainder is spent on fundraising initiatives and maintaining an international network of support staff. Plan International publishes annual reports detailing its fundraising and spending activity. The organization receives funding to implement grants from a range of multilateral institutions, such as the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other multilateral agencies. Plan International adheres to several international standards and quality assurance mechanisms including the International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGO) Commitment to Accountability Charter and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief.  Notable persons associated  Anil Kapoor, who starred in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire, is an ambassador for Plan India.Plan India He donated his entire fee for the movie to the NGO's Universal Birth Registration campaign.

Early years Muller was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Mildred (Kuhlmann) and Romeo Earl Muller. He was raised on Long Island. His talents in the arts were evident very early on. At age 11, he became a puppeteer at his grade school and eventually he began writing his own plays. His career in theatre began when he joined an acting troupe called \\"Theater Go Round\\" in Virginia Beach, Virginia with producer/friend Lesley Savage. At this time Romeo wrote plays such as Angel With The Big, Big Ears and The Great Getaway, which eventually became the Rankin-Bass off Broadway play A Month Of Sundays. Since Muller was a big man at 6'2\\", 300 pounds (1.88 m, 136 kg), he decided to stay away from acting and turn his attention towards writing. Career After writing material for comedian Jack Benny, Muller was discovered by CBS founder William S. Paley and selected to be a staff writer for the prestigious Studio One and Philco Theatre. He wrote one of the most popular episodes for the Studio One series entitled \\"Love Me To Pieces, Baby\\". In 1963, Muller met with producer/directors Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass and began a relationship that would last for years. Rankin and Bass asked Romeo to write a screenplay for their first Network television special, entitled Return to Oz, which aired on NBC's the General Electric Fantasy Hour. The special was a success and set the stage for the most popular holiday television special of all time Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Muller embellished the short story into an hour-long broadcast and added a variety of characters into the story. He is also known for his screenplays in other such films as Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, The Little Drummer Boy, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, and Frosty the Snowman, among many others. In 1965, several Theatre-Five radio productions featured Muller as writer and/or actor. He was also the voice of the narrator, a talking sun in the first three Strawberry Shortcake TV specials from the 1980s, which he also wrote and co-produced. Muller read his favorite and first Christmas story every year on Christmas Eve on New York radio station WGHQ. This story was reworked with a different ending for an animated film in 1992 and aired days before Muller died. In 2002 the book Jill Chill & the Baron of Glacier Mountain by Ed McCray featured a character named Romeo after Muller. The book is written in the style of the old Christmas specials that Muller had written.

He is primarily known for his work Historia general del Piru (written c.1580-1616), which is considered the earliest illustrated history of Peru. Murúa's career in Peru Murúa volunteered to serve in the missions of New Spain, where he was sent by his superiors and arrived in Peru in the early 1580s. He is known to have lived in the Curahuasi Valley around that period. He later traveled throughout the Viceroyalty of Peru as a missionary, serving in the proximities of Lake Titicaca and Cuzco, where he came to know some features of the inhabitants of the former Inca Empire well. From about 1595 to 1601 his residence was at the Mercedarian Monastery of St. John Lateran in Arequipa. In addition to his missionary work, Murúa gathered data to write a history of the Andean past. He was assisted in his translation of the date from the Quechua language by a native Inca nobleman Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala (also known as Guamán Poma), who provided over 100 illustrations of great historical significance for the work, but who was later highly critical of Murúa's depiction of Inca history in his own writings. In 1611, Murúa made the decision to return to Spain. He chose, however, not to take the usual route, by way of Panama. Instead, he traveled across the Amazon Forest, crossing the Andes, arriving in La Plata. After a lengthy stay, from there he went on to Potosí and then to the Tucumán region. All along the way, he took the opportunity to have the local religious and government authorities review his work for comment and correction. He eventually passed through Córdoba and arrived in Buenos Aires, from which he set sail for Spain in 1615. The following year, while living in Madrid, Murúa received the necessary authorizations from both his Order and the king to publish his chronicle, entitled Historia general del Piru. The work covers Peru's pre-Columbian and early Spanish colonial history. In his Historia, Murúa wrote of the presence of a number of mythological creatures in South America, such as Amazons and giants, which gave rise to the names of many geographical landmarks of the continent. The Galvin and Getty manuscripts Pachakutiq worshipping Inti (sun God) in the Coricancha, in his second chronicle Libro segundo, del gobierno que los Yngas tubieron en este reino y ritos y ceremonias que guardaban. (Second book, of the government that the Incas had in this kingdom and rites and ceremonies that they kept.), manuscript completed in 1613. There exist two versions of the Historia general del Piru: the Galvin Murúa (also known as the \\"Loyola Murúa\\") and the Getty Murúa (also known as the \\"Wellington Murúa\\"). The former is kept in a private collection in Ireland while the latter is at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, California. The original as well as a facsimile of the Galvin Murúa are available at the Getty Center for consultation by qualified scholars. The Galvin Murúa dates from the 1580s and was completed around 1600. This first version of the chronicle was compiled in Peru by Murúa with the assistance of local scribes and Indigenous artists (one of whom was Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala). By the 18th century, the Galvin Murúa ended up in the possession of the Jesuit College in Alcalá de Henares, Spain. Between 1879-1900, the manuscript was housed in a Jesuit enclave in Poyanne, France. Its association with the Jesuits gave the manuscript its title the \\"Loyola Murúa\\" (after St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order). In the 1950s, the manuscript was bought by a rare bookseller in San Francisco, California and resold to the late John Galvin (d. 1996), a European aristocrat and private collector. The text remains in the hands of the Galvin family in County Meath, Ireland. The Getty Murúa dates from 1615–16 and was the second version of the chronicle. Most of the text was compiled in Peru and present- day Bolivia, although it was most likely re-edited in Spain. This version received the final approbation for printing, however for unknown reasons it remained unpublished during the seventeenth century. Once in Spain, the manuscript was somehow acquired by Castilian statesman and bibliophile Lorenzo Ramirez de Prado. After Ramirez's death in 1658, it was incorporated into the library of the Colegio Mayor de Cuenca in Salamanca and finally the private library of King Charles IV of Spain in 1802. As a result of the Peninsular War, it came into the possession of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Thus the manuscript acquired the title the \\"Wellington Murúa.\\" It was later sold at auction to a collector in Cologne, Germany, changing hands once more before its \\"rediscovery\\" by Manuel Ballesteros Gaibrois in the early 1950s. Ballesteros Gaibrois published a two volume edition of Historia general del Piru in 1962 and 1964. In 1983, the manuscript was sold to the Getty Research Institute. Since then it has been known as the \\"Getty Murúa.\\" Research has proven that several images (including two by Guaman Poma) from the Galvin Murúa were removed and pasted into the Getty Murúa, although overall the Galvin Murúa contains more images than its counterpart. The images in both manuscripts were colored using paints, dyes, and silver from the Americas and Europe. An exhaustive study of both manuscripts was funded by the Getty Research Institute in 2007-2008. Murúa's Historia general del Piru (1616) Murúa's chronicle is divided into three books. The following is the complete title of the work: Historia General del Pirú. Origen y descen dencia de los Incas, donde se trata de las guerras civiles Ingas como de la entrada de los españoles Descripción de las ciudades y lugares del, con otras cosas notables, compuesto por el Muy rdo. Fr. Martín de Murúa, elector genl. del orden de nra. Sa de las mds. Rra de captious, comor y cura de Hunata. The first book is divided into 92 chapters and contains the following: (I) Libro del Origen y descendencia de los Ingas. Señores deste Reyno del Pirú donde se ponen las conquistas que hizieron de differentes probinc ias Y Naciones y Guerras civiles hasta la entra da De los Españoles, con su modo de governar cond ción y trato y la descripción de las más prinsi pales Ciudades y Villas de esta amplisima provincia. The second book has 40 chapters and includes the following: (II) Libro segundo, del gobierno que los Yngas tubieron en este reino y ritos y ce remonias que gardaban. Finally, the third book contains the following in 31 chapters: (III) Libro tersero, donde se trata, en general, y particular deste reino del Pirú, y las ciudades prins ipales y villas. Murúa worked closely with indigenous peoples in compiling his text, incorporating their testimonies and oral accounts of Inca culture and political history into Historia general del Piru. The most striking feature of the chronicle is its numerous illustrations, which include portraits of Inca nobility and depictions of traditional ceremonies. These images blend European and indigenous artistic traditions. Murúa and Guamán Poma Guamán Poma de Ayala depicting the friar Morúa beating a Inca worker. The superimposed legend says: FRAILE MERZENARIO MORVA. son tan bravos y justicieros y mal trata a los yndios y haze trauajar con un palo en este reyno en las dotrinas no ay rremedio. (MERCENARIAN FRIAR MORÚA. are so brave and righteous (righteous or avengers) and he mistreat the Indians and he make them work with a stick in this kingdom in the doctrines there is no remedy.), El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno. There is strong evidence that the chroniclers Guamán Poma and Martín de Murúa met and there was a close collaboration between them that later ended in rupture. Twentieth-century scholars had often speculated that there existed a some relationship between Guamán Poma's Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno and Friar Martín de Murúa's Historia general del Piru (1616), assuming that Guamán Poma served as an informant or coauthor to Murúa. In 1967, Condarco Morales performed a comparative study of the texts and concluded that Guamán Poma followed Murúa's work. A direct relationship between Guamán Poma and Murúa was confirmed by the Getty research project (2007–2008). The project's principal scholars included Juan de Ossio, Thomas Cummins, and Barbara Anderson, with collaboration by Rolena Adorno and Ivan Boserup. After comparing the Getty Murúa and Galvin Murúa, these scholars proved that the chronicle does in fact include illustrations by Guamán Poma. They concluded that Guamán Poma was one of a team of scribes and artists that worked for Murúa while he was in Peru. While Murúa's project began sometime in the 1580s, Guamán Poma became involved only as an illustrator and only shortly before 1600. These findings were the basis of an exhibition and symposium at the Getty Center in October 2008. Guamán Poma notably attacks Murúa in his Corónica, even depicting the friar striking and kicking an indigenous woman seated at a loom. This image is entitled \\"The Mercedarian friar Martín de Murúa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands.\\" According to Rolena Adorno, \\"... when he became an author after 1600, [Guamán Poma] was highly critical of a work by Murúa that he had recently illustrated. Guamán Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Murúa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in the Galvin Murúa. Guamán Poma extended Andean history back in time of the era predating the Inca, and he also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society such as no other chronicle of his time produced. Guamán Poma's artistic repertoire, which was displayed in his own work in the creation of nearly four hundred drawings, drew upon the formative experience he had gained while working with Murúa, but it also developed in new directions to reveal a strong polemical and satirical bent that was directed against the abuses perpetrated under colonial rule ... Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Murúa and Guamán Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru.\\" [1] See also * Guamán Poma * Inca Garcilaso de la Vega * Diego Fernández References Citations *1.

Bradley was a self-unloading Great Lakes freighter that sank in a Lake Michigan storm on November 18, 1958. Of the 35 crew members, 33 died in the sinking. 23 were from the port town of Rogers City, Michigan. Her sinking was likely caused by structural failure from the brittle steel used in her construction. Many husbands and fathers from the town were lost as a result of the wreck. Built in 1927 by the American Ship Building Company in Lorain, Ohio, Carl D. Bradley was owned by the Michigan Limestone division of U.S. Steel, and operated by the Bradley Transportation Line. She retained the title of \\"Queen of the Lakes\\" for 22 years as the longest and largest freighter on the Great Lakes. History =Design and construction= The Bradley Transportation's fleet of self-unloading ships was used to haul limestone from the Michigan Limestone quarry in Rogers City, Michigan. Carl D. Bradley was built to meet Michigan Limestone's lucrative contract with a cement firm in Gary, Indiana.Schumacher (2008), p. 8. By , she was longer than the second largest ship on the Great Lakes and her engine had almost twice the power of engines installed in most freighters.Thompson (1994), pp. 136–137. At , she was the longest freighter (and the largest self-unloader) on the lakes for 22 years. Later the AA class of U.S. Steel-owned freighters was roughly the same size as Carl D. Bradley but shorter in length by just inches. Carl D. Bradley retained the title \\"Queen of the Lakes\\" until the launch of the SS Wilfred Sykes in 1949.Thompson (1994), p. 139. Carl D. Bradley began as hull 797 in 1923 at the American Shipbuilding Company in Lorain, Ohio. She was launched at Lorain on April 9, 1927. She was outfitted with her fore and aft housing in the ensuing months until her maiden voyage when Mr. and Mrs. Carl D. Bradley, the community band, and hundreds of people from Rogers City greeted her the first time she steamed into Calcite Harbor on July 28, 1927. The vessel was named for Carl David Bradley, who was president of Michigan Limestone. Bradley declared that the new ship was \\"the last word in freighter construction.\\"Thompson (1994), p. 136. The U.S. Coast Guard described Carl D. Bradleys design and construction as: > ... [a] typical arrangement for self-unloading type vessels with a forepeak > and large cargo area, and hawing propulsion machinery aft. These areas were > separated by two transverse watertight bulkheads, the collision bulkhead at > frame 12, and the engine room forward bulkhead at frame 173. The cargo hold > space was divided into five compartments by screen bulkheads above the > tunnel and the unloading machinery was located in the conveyor room just > forward the cargo spaces. The entire 475 foot length of the cargo space was > open longitudinally through the tunnel and conveyor room.USCGReport (1959), > p. 6. As the flagship of Bradley Transportation Company, Carl D. Bradley often carried corporate officials and guests in her staterooms. She received more attention than the other ships in the fleet with her gray and red paint always fresh, her decks freshly hosed down, and a larger crew.Schumacher (2008), pp. 9, 22. Carl D. Bradley had individual rooms for the captain, chief mates, chief steward, and engine room officers. The rest of the crew was housed in comfortable dormitory style rooms. She had a \\"state-of-the-art\\" galley with huge refrigeration units and storage pantries. Her engine room housed a huge generator powered by two Foster-Wheeler boilers. Carl D. Bradley was the only fully electric ship in the Bradley Transportation fleet. Her generator powered everything from the propeller to the running lights.Schumacher (2008), p. 10. =Career= Carl D. Bradley registered port was New York City; however, her true base of operations was Rogers City, Michigan, where Michigan Limestone was based. The Bradley Transportation fleet was predominantly crewed by men from Rogers City. Many of crew were friends, neighbors, or related to each other.Schumacher (2008), p. 24. As the boats often departed and returned every few days, many of the crew made their homes and raised their families in Rogers City.Schumacher (2008), p. xiv. During her career, Carl D. Bradley carried different grades of limestone from Lake Huron to deepwater ports on Lakes Michigan and Erie and occasionally Lake Superior.Schumacher (2008), p. 9. Carl D. Bradley set new records in stone trade. She carried her largest cargo in 1929 when she loaded with of limestone, a cargo that would require 300 railroad cars to move.Thompson (1994), p. 137. She was the first lake freighter to pass through the new MacArthur Lock at the Soo Locks in 1943. As the largest ship on the lakes, Carl D. Bradley was traditionally the first boat through the Straits of Mackinac when the ice kept the smaller vessels from leaving port. She served as an icebreaker. Her forepeak was filled with concrete; she would break ice to Indiana, and then go to the Lorain shipyard for replacement of broken plates before starting her season.Schumacher (2008), p. 12. Carl D. Bradley sustained damage when she was in a collision with MV White Rose on the St. Clair River on April 3, 1957. She was in dry dock in Chicago, Illinois for seven days in May 1957 for major repairs to her hull.USCG Report (1959), p. 6. Carl D. Bradley had two groundings while proceeding out of Cedarville, Michigan, one in the spring of 1958 and the other in November 1958. These groundings were not reported to the U.S. Coast Guard. The November grounding required repairs. The U.S. Coast Guard investigation considered whether the groundings caused hull stresses that contributed to Carl D. Bradleys sinking.USCG Report (1959), p. 3. The U.S. Coast Guard noted that although Bradley Transportation received an award for 2,228,775 injury-free man hours from April 24, 1955 to December 31, 1957 while operating Carl D. Bradley, the company's focus was industrial safety rather than material safety of the vessel.USCG Report (1959), p. 7. Since the Bradley Transportation founding in 1912, it had never lost a ship until Carl D. Bradley sank.Kantar (2006), p. 33. Although Carl D. Bradley was normally one of the busiest ships in the Bradley fleet, she was laid up from July 1 to October 1, 1958 due to a downturn in the steel industry. She made only 43 round trips in the 1958 shipping season. Carl D. Bradley was scheduled for repairs in Manitowoc, Wisconsin when she laid up over the winter.USCGReport (1959), p. 5. Her owner, Bradley Transportation Company (a U.S. Steel subsidiary), planned an $800,000 replacement of her rusting cargo hold and bulkheads.Kantar (2006), p. 19. A common joke among her crew was that she was being held together by her rust.Schumacher (2008), p. 5. Sailors reported that they picked up sheared off rivets by the bucketful following storms due to Carl D. Bradleys excessive twisting and bending in heavy weather.Schumacher (2008), pp. 5–6. The U.S. Coast Guard conducted an annual inspection of Carl D. Bradley on April 17, 1958 and found her seaworthy.USCGReport (1959), p. 18. On October 30, 1958, the U.S. Coast Guard found no problems during a safety inspection of Carl D. Bradley that included a fire and boat drill. =Final voyage= Carl D. Bradley met its fate on November 18, 1958 while en route to Port of Calcite, the harbor in Rogers City, Michigan. The previous day, she had completed what was initially supposed to be her last voyage of the 1958 season, which she completed with the delivery of a cargo of crushed stone at Gary, Indiana.Kantar (2006), p. 21. After leaving Gary, Carl D. Bradley set course for Manitowoc, where she was due to spend her winter layup in drydock and was to have a new cargo hold fitted.Schumacher (2008), pp. 3–4. She departed Gary for Manitowoc empty on her final voyage on November 17 at 10:00 p.m. with in her ballast tanks for stability.Kantar (2006), p. 22. However, when Carl D. Bradley was only a few hours from Manitowoc, she received an order from U.S. Steel to return to Calcite, as they had scheduled her to deliver another load of stone at the last minute.November Requiem, Bon Ami Filmworks, 2009. The winds were at the start of her trip. The weather forecast was a gale with southerly winds changing to southwest.USCGReport (1959), p. 1. Carl D. Bradleys path would take it into a lethal storm that was the result of two separate weather patterns merging. A line of thirty tornadoes extended from Illinois to Texas; more than a of snow fell on North and South Dakota; nearly of snow fell in Wyoming; Nevada's temperatures plummeted to below freezing; and Tucson, Arizona, had a record snowfall.Schumacher (2008), pp. 15–16. Captain Roland Bryan was known as a \\"heavy weather captain\\" who took pride in delivering his cargo on time.Schumacher (2008), pp. 2–3. Bryan's usual course up Lake Michigan was quicker and ran closer to the Michigan shore. On November 18, he avoided the brunt of the building seas by instead traveling along the lee of the Wisconsin shore. He planned a course with his first and second mate that would take them to Cana Island near the Wisconsin shore and then they would turn at Lansing Shoal near the Beaver Island group.Schumacher (2008), p. 13. Although the seas gathered strength from the southwest, they were not considered severe and she was riding smoothly. However, there is evidence that regardless of his reputation, Captain Bryan likely had his doubts concerning how well the 31-year-old vessel could manage in rough seas. Not long before Carl D. Bradleys loss, Bryan stated in a letter to a friend that he was well aware that the ship was not in the best condition structurally and should not be out in bad weather. He also expressed in the letter that he was relieved that Carl D. Bradley was slated to receive a new cargo hold during her winter lay-up in Manitowoc.\\"November Requiem\\", 2008 Two ships were running parallel with Carl D. Bradley when she passed Milwaukee, Wisconsin at 4:00 a.m. on November 18. Carl D. Bradley reduced her speed sometime prior to 4:00 p.m. to . By 4:00 p.m, she was past Poverty Island with the captain in charge of navigation and the first mate on watch. Winds were storm force from the southwest at . Carl D. Bradley was \\"riding comfortably with a heavy following sea slightly on the starboard quarter.\\"USCGReport (1959), p. 8. At 5:35 p.m. the ship was about southwest of Gull Island. At this moment a loud thud was heard followed by a vibration. The first mate turned aft and saw the stern of the vessel sagging. The captain slammed the engine's telegraph to \\"stop engines\\" and sounded the alarm to abandon ship.Schumacher (2008), p. 38. As the ship broke in two, he shouted at the crew on deck to run and don their life jackets.Schumacher (2008), p. 51. The first mate managed to radio transmissions of mayday and give their position before the power lines aboard the ship were severed.USCGReport (1959), pp. 9–11. The distress call was picked up by the Coast Guard, amateur radio and commercial stations on land and sea. Carl D. Bradley had one life raft stored in the bow section and two lifeboats stored in the stern section. The crew in the stern section attempted to lower the lifeboats.USCGReport (1959), p. 11. One lifeboat became entangled in cables and the other lifeboat dangled at an impossible angle for launching or boarding.Schumacher (2008), p. 53. The life raft was tossed clear of the wreck when the bow section sank.Schumacher (2008), p. 55. The four crew members who reached the life raft were repeatedly thrown off by the massive waves and only two survived.Schumacher (2008), pp. 85–86. The crew on the German cargo vessel Christian Sartori witnessed the sinking of Carl D. Bradley through their binoculars. They saw the lights go out on the fore part of the ship while the aft end of the ship remained lit. Then they saw the lights on the aft end go out so that the silhouette of the ship remained barely visible. A short time later they heard an explosion and saw a red, yellow and white column of flame and remnants shoot up in the air .Schumacher (2008), pp. 48–50. They \\"concluded that the Bradley had exploded\\".USCGReport (1959), p. 2. =Search and rescue= After witnessing the Carl D. Bradley explosion, Christian Sartori immediately altered course for Carl D. Bradleys location but the wind and waves were so fierce that it took her one and one-half hours to traverse the that separated the vessels. The Plum Island lifesaving station deployed a boat within minutes of the Carl D. Bradley sinking. The crew was unable to steer or make any headway in the storm and was forced to seek the shelter of nearby Washington Island.Schumacher (2008), p. 64. The USCG Cutter Sundew went out from Charlevoix, Michigan into the open lake in the pounding seas of an unremitting gale. She arrived at the search area at 10:40 p.m. on November 19, five hours after Carl D. Bradley sank.Schumacher (2008), p. 93. Coast Guard Station Charlevoix also launched a motor lifeboat in an attempt to reach Carl D. Bradley, but this was ordered back after being mercilessly tossed about on Lake Michigan. The USCG Cutter Hollyhock from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin arrived on the search scene at 1:30 a.m. on November 19 after a 7-hour trip that her skipper described as \\"a visit to hell.\\"Schumacher (2008), p. 96. During the night, friends and family members of the Carl D. Bradley crew drove from Rogers City and the surrounding towns to Charlevoix where any survivors would arrive. They kept vigil by lining the beach at Charlevoix with their car headlights turned on.Rattigan (1977), p. 29. Eight other commercial vessels joined the search at daybreak. U.S. Coast Guard air and surface units searched for survivors throughout the following days. At 8:37 a.m. on November 19, Sundew located Carl D. Bradleys forward life raft 15 hours after the lake freighter sank and from the sinking site. Two survivors were on the raft — First Mate Elmer H. Fleming, 43, and Deck Watchman Frank L. Mays, 26.Schumacher (2008), pp. 108–109. Another crew member from Carl D. Bradley, deckwatch Gary Strzelecki, was also found alive, but died not long after being rescued. The two survivors said that they fired two of the three signal flares stored on the life raft not long after Carl D. Bradley sank. When they tried to fire the remaining flare, it was wet and would not fire when Christian Sartori passed within without seeing them.Schumacher (2008), pp. 71–72. Mays reported that his cork-filled life jacket kept him buoyed but he had to hold it down just keep it on due to the force of the waves. He knew that he had to find something to hold on to in order to survive. During the day, Sundew and other vessels recovered 17 more bodies, all wearing lifejackets.Kantar (2006), p. 49. The bodies were brought to Charlevoix City Hall for family identification. More lifejackets were found laced up, indicating that they may have slipped off while they were worn. In all, of the 35 crewmen, 33 lost their lives. The bodies of the 15 men not recovered remain missing to this day.Schumacher (2008), pp. 165, 199. After the ice broke up in the spring of the 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers located Carl D. Bradleys wreck using sonar equipment aboard MS Williams. The wreck was found northwest of Boulder Reef and just south of Gull Island lying at a depth of .Kantar (2006), p. 55. Later in 1959, Carl D. Bradleys owners, U.S. Steel Corporation, hired Los Angeles-based Global Marine Exploration Company to survey the wreck using the underwater television from Submarex. They concluded that the ship was lying in one piece. However, the two survivors continued to maintain that they saw Carl D. Bradley break in two.Kantar (2006), p. 56. The U.S. Steel survey of the wreck was criticized because it was conducted in secrecy without impartial witnesses.Schumacher (2008), p. 167. Coast Guard investigation and recommendations =Investigation= The Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation found that Carl D. Bradley sank from excessive hogging stresses. The Marine Board reported that four vessels were crossing Lake Michigan parallel or ahead of Carl D. Bradley during the storm and that eight other vessels sought shelter at the time of the casualty.USCGReport (1959), pp. 8–9. They concluded that Captain Bryan \\"exercised poor judgment\\" when he decided to leave the shelter of the Wisconsin shore and sail into the open lake during the storm.Thompson (2000), pp. 307, 309, 314. However, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, Vice Admiral A.C. Richmond, issued his own report that disapproved the Marine Board's conclusion that the master of Carl D. Bradley used poor judgment. Richmond noted that his conclusion was supported by the vessel's 31-year history of Great Lakes navigation and the report that it was sailing smoothly prior to its sinking. His report also rejected that hogging stresses caused Carl D. Bradley to sink. He concluded that she broke up due to \\"undetected structural weakness or defect.\\"USCGReport (1959), p. 3. Maritime historian Mark Thompson wrote that the type of steel used in the older vessels may have caused their structural failure: > After the Carl D. Bradley sank in 1958, Coast Guard technical experts were > aware of the shortcomings of the notch-sensitive and brittle steel that was > used to build many ships prior to 1948, but there doesn't seem to have been > any program in place to warn the owners or crew of such vessels. That led to > the loss of the SS Daniel J. Morrell in 1966, and may have been a factor in > many other shipwrecks.Thompson (2000), p. 339. =Recommendations= Following their investigation of the Carl D. Bradley sinking, the U.S. Marine Board of Investigation made the following safety recommendations: :1. Mechanical changes should be made in the way lifeboats are disengaged and deployed.USCGReport (1959), pp. 18–19. :2. A second life raft should be mandatory on Great Lakes cargo ships because they land upright no matter how they are overturned. :3. Each life boat should be equipped with two tow ropes (painters). :4. Six parachute-type flare signals with equipment for firing them skyward should be stored on each lifeboat and life raft. :5. The cork and canvas life vests should be updated to include crotch straps and collars to support the neck. The Great Lakes shipping industry later replaced the rigid, open rafts like the one carried on Carl D. Bradley with inflatable life rafts with an enclosed canopy for protection against the elements.Thompson (1994), p. 142. In 1968, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) gave notice to the U.S. Coast Guard Commandant that the structural failure sustained by SS Edward Y. Townsend, Carl D. Bradley, and could recur under similar circumstances. The NTSB recommended that the U.S. Coast Guard take action to implement a progressive structural renewal on ships constructed prior to 1948. Legal settlement Carl D. Bradleys estimated value at the time her loss was $8 million. It made her the most costly shipwreck in Great Lakes history.Schumacher (2008), p. 138. U.S. Steel initially offered $660,000 as a settlement. Family members of the lost crewmen felt that U.S. Steel used the U.S. Coast Guard findings to avoid responsibility for the loss of Carl D. Bradley. The company believed that their 1959 survey results of the wreck supported their position that the Carl D. Bradley loss was an \\"act of God\\".Schumacher (2008), p. 168. Ten families filed lawsuits seeking more than $7 million just weeks after the U.S. Coast Guard report was released.Schumacher (2008), p. 199. U.S. Steel reached a $1,250,000 lump-sum settlement one year and sixteen days after Carl D. Bradley sank. A commissioner was appointed to determine how the settlement money would be divided among the families. The settlement would not guarantee lifelong financial security to the Carl D. Bradley families. One published source said the settlement was \\"one of the fastest in maritime history for a case of its scope.\\"Schumacher (2008), p. 171. Later wreck surveys Carl D. Bradleys pilot house door in 2007 Jim Clary, marine author and artist, and Fred Shannon, maritime explorer, led two diving expeditions to the wreck.Schumacher (2008), pp. 184–185. with the goal to prove that the survivor's account that Carl D. Bradley broke apart was accurate.Shannon (Vol. 5, 2008), p. 9. Carl D. Bradley survivor Frank Mays participated in both expeditions. The first expedition in 1995 was conducted with a submersible. It was unable to conclusively prove whether Carl D. Bradley broke apart due to poor visibility and weather conditions.McCosh (1996), p. 96. However, \\"Mays, as the only living survivor of the tragedy, placed a plaque on the wreck in memory of his fellow crewmen.\\" Clary, Shannon, and Mays conducted the second expedition in 1997 with a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). They obtained underwater video film showing two sections of Carl D. Bradley sitting upright about apart at a depth of .Schumacher (2008), p. 185. Forty years after her sinking, Frank Mays, survivor of the Carl D. Bradley disaster was able to view her hull from inside the submersible. Mays later wrote, \\"I saw it go down in two pieces on the surface and now I've seen it in two pieces on the bottom of Lake Michigan.\\"Schumacher (2008), p. 186. This was arguably an unparalleled experience in Great Lakes shipwreck history.Thompson (2000), p. 309. Carl D. Bradleys wreck lies in of water in a thermocline with a temperature of . A very high degree of technical skill and long decompression are required to dive this wreck. The wreck is totally encrusted with quagga mussels. Mirek Standowicz made the first scuba dives to Carl D. Bradley in 2001. He videotaped the pilot house for a documentary in production by Out of Blue Productions. His video recorded the glass blown out of the pilot house windows and the telegraph in the stop position.Schumacher (2008), p. 187–188. Two Minnesota divers, John Janzen and John Scoles, spent months preparing to remove Carl D. Bradleys bell. They designed a special battery system and underwater torch and conducted practice dives in a flooded iron mine in Wisconsin.Schumacher (2008), p. 189. After obtaining the required permission from Michigan government agencies, Scoles and Janzen conducted three dives to Carl D. Bradley in August 2007.Pabst (2007) They removed the original bell and replaced it with memorial bell of similar dimensions, engraved with the names of the lost crew. They were the first scuba divers to reach the stern of Carl D. Bradley, including long penetration dives inside the ship's engine room. Carl D. Bradley survivor Frank Mays was present on the surface during the dives and saw the bell for the first time in 49 years when it broke the water surface.Schumacher (2008), p. 192.  Legacy and memorial  Of the 35 crewmen, 33 died in the sinking, and 23 were from Rogers City, Michigan, a town with 3,873 residents.Schumacher (2008), pp. xiii–xiii. Twenty-three women were widowed and fifty-three children became fatherless.Kantar (2006), p. 54. Two Carl D. Bradley wives had children on the way.Schumacher (2008), p. 116. The largest mass funeral service was held at St. Ignatius Catholic Church for nine of the recovered Carl D. Bradley victims.Kantar (2006), p. 53. Friends and relatives would nearly double the town's population during the funerals and memorial services. There was a funeral on every street. The town's mayor issued an official proclamation declaring that every November 18 would be dedicated to the memory of the men lost on the ship.Kantar (2006), pp. 51–54. The Mariner's Church of Detroit, Michigan offered special prayers for the vessel's sailors. Ships at sea dropped anchor at noon for memorial services for those lost on Carl D. Bradley.Rattigan (1977), pp. 33–34. The Detroit News established the \\"Carl D. Bradley Ship Disaster Fund\\" and contributed $1,000 to set it up. Donations came from across the country, ranging from Michigan Limestone's $10,000 contribution, to collections aboard commercial ships, to individual donations.Schumacher (2008), p. 132. On August 9, 1997, a memorial in Rogers City's Lakeside Park was dedicated to the thirty-three men who lost their lives on Carl D. Bradley and Cedarville.Kantar (2006), p. 51. The bell from Carl D. Bradley was returned to Rogers City in 2007. It was restored and unveiled in a ceremony held on the weekend of the 49th anniversary of the sinking.50th Anniversary, Carl D. Bradley memorial, Carl D. Bradley home page. On November 17, 2008, a 50th Anniversary Memorial was held at the Great Lakes Lore Maritime Museum in Rogers City when Carl D. Bradleys bell was tolled to commemorate the crew.Modrzynski, Mike. Ceremony to honor men lost on Carl D. Bradley November 17, 2008. Alpena News. The documentary movie November Requiem premiered at the Rogers City Theater during the ceremonies. It used author Andrew Kantar's book, Black November, as a major source and focused on the repercussions on the small community of Rogers City after Carl D. Bradley sank. The documentary was featured on PBS in November 2008. In 2010, it won two Emmy awards for best historical documentary and best original music score. In 2019, Captain Andrew Stempki released a “songumentary” entitled The Men Long Forgotten that memorialized the wreck. Stempki is also constructing a screenplay for a feature film.

He was born in Harrison County, Virginia (now part of West Virginia) but spent most of his life in Missouri, where he was a merchant and steamboat captain. In 1849 he joined the gold rush to California at the head of a wagon train. In California the next year, reports arrived of impending starvation among numerous immigrants on the Nevada side of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Waldo put great effort into recruiting and delivering supplies for them, and became well known for his relief attempts. In 1853 the Whig party nominated Waldo as their candidate for Governor, but he narrowly lost to the incumbent John Bigler. Following his defeat, he returned east, first to Minnesota and then back to Missouri where his wife and children had remained. In his later years he moved to Texas, where he died.
